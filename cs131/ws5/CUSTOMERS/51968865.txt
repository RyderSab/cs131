This one was different and very engrossing to say the least. <br />The characters were very realistic and I liked how the author created a confusing pallet of who was good and who was bad and she made you think about your morals and thoughts. <br />The twin who takes her sister's place, Kait was very real and very interesting.  The story revolves around her and never really strays to anyone else's thoughts too much.  Which I found unbelievably suspenseful at times.  The fact that two women who are born together and look identical and do not share that pairbond that most twins claim to have was very different.   <br />The twin Lana who leaves her life to take care of a problem while Kait has switched with her was sleek and engaging.  The fact that she was very pompous and arrogant and high maintenance and so opposite of her sister was fascinating.  Her secrets and the twists the author provides makes for a read that will keep you up all night. <br />Will Kait survive the few days she is asked to take Lana's place?  Will Lana come back in time to fix what is wrong and save her twin that she hadn't ever been close to and for once keep a promise to her?  Will Kait succumb to the temptation of Lana's gorgeous husband? <br />These thoughts and others will run wild in your head as you delve into their dangerous world of deception and forbidden wants.  Kait will realize her sister is someone entirely different from the sex-kitten she grew up with and far more faceted.  The trouble is, will Kait keep up and succeed in pretending to be this woman? <br />A deadly game that could get them both in serious trouble and more enemies than Kait can handle make this book a keeper. <br />Hard to put down and harder to forget. <br />  <br />~@Tracy Talley	2005-05-14

Why?  Because of the story written by Dee Davis.  The second one.<br /><br />Claudia Dain's story 'Tracked' was first and probably the worst.  I was stunned at the childish way it was done and the characters being so unbelievably unlikeable.  Aren't we supposed to like the heroine?  The 'scary' parts were FAR from frightening and the story left me not scared or worried for her, it left me hoping she would perish and the story would end.  I hadn't realized it would be about a bunch of kids doing stupid things in the woods while a killer lurks and somehow a love story emerges?  More along the lines of a 'B' movie.  1 Star...<br /><br />Dee Davis's 'Still of the Night' was good.  It was far from excellent, but it was fairly entertaining.  The heroine was realistic and the scenes were charged with suspense.  Not what I expected still for the title of this collaboration is 'Silent Night' with a dark and cold snowy setting and a lone glove seeming to reach out for help in the tracks left behind it.  But if you're looking for a real thriller in this story, you won't get it still.  This is about mistakes and set-ups and murder-for-hire plot.  2 Stars...<br /><br />Evelyn Rogers is the last in the novella with her story 'Wounded'.  It was not a thriller and never scary or suspensful.  I guess one could loosely call it a mystery, but I would never.  This one is more 'wounded stranger on the run, stumbles upon irritating woman alone in house in the woods'.  The heroine is very irritating and soon you start to empathize with the hero.  She doesn't make for an interesting character.<br /><br />Looking for a collection of thrillers?  Not here...look elsewhere.  Very disapointing.

You read it and you are so caught up in the story that you lose track of time and place.  A story that takes you right into the heart of what the writer was envisioning.  Usually I am sadly not a big fan of this author's work, but this book blows her others far out of the water! <br />(I won't go into the details of what the book was about since everyone else has, so from here on my reviews will reflect my thoughts on the book itself because frankly that is what I look for in reviews myself.) <br />The touching and sometimes emotional story between the character of Jackson and the woman who saves him Rebecca is completely unlike any other. <br />Jackson is so real and so hurt and 'damaged' you as the reader find yourself wishing you could crawl inside the story and help.  His secret is so overwhelming and charged with emotion, it's hard to imagine he would keep it. <br />Rebecca is the epitome of what a heroine should be.  She is very good-hearted and strong.  She sees the good in him even though no one else does and she stands by him with conviction and hires him on at her greenhouse even with the 15 year prison sentence in his past.  She sees him for who he really is. <br />I was touched and in awe of Jackson. The love between him and the heroine is very real and seems almost destined.  As if they do exist and are out there somewhere.   <br />But the most awe inspiring moment is when his deep and dark secret is revealed to her...you will cry.  Get the tissues, seriously, you will need them. <br /> <br />Tracy Talley~@	2005-04-12

I hated to give my favorite author four stars instead of five, but this story IMO was not like the others in that excellent respect.  It was still great, but not excellent.  What I mean by that is this.<br /><br />It was two stories rolled into one book, told back and forth every few chapters she would switch.  So in all, it was some 357 pages and each story got more of a 'short story' treatment.  Each was about 178 pages or so.  In all, it didn't seem like enough time to tell the stories of two Viking characters that belong in this long series.<br /><br />These twins were introduced mainly in \\"The Blue Viking\\" and were fun and interesting, in their own stories, the only one I found interesting was Vagn.  Toste was a little cold and aloof.  For twins who would die for one another and felt each others pain and sadness, Vagn seemed the only one who was willing to try and find his brother and mourned his supposed death the entire book.  Toste seemed more interested in sleeping with the nun who saved his life, lol.<br /><br />Again, this is all my humble opinion.  I almost wish Ms. Hill would've left them as secondary characters. This is the 7th book in this series and the series is still going strong with this entry being the least interesting.  The great part?  Playing catch-up to all the former main characters from previous books.  The only missing ones were Rurik and Meg from \\"The Blue Viking,\\" the 5th book.<br /><br />Told each other was dead on the mangled and bloody battlefield, identical Viking twins Toste and Vagn each are saved separately and are in two different places and go on two completely opposite journeys to get home.  Problem?  They sense one another still, even though they are told the other is dead.  Deep down they both must find out the truth before they can really live.<br /><br />Toste is saved by a nun who seems to be in trouble with her father and brothers.  He is so taken with her, he vows to help her no matter what it takes.  The 'nun' isn't really a 'nun' in the sense, she has been at the Abby for nearly 15 years now and hasn't taken her vows.  Her dilemma is that she tends to swear, break the commandments on occasion and has a desire for tall and gorgeous Vikings.  So trying to dodge someone trying to kill her for her land and accepting help from said Viking, Esme is in trouble...<br /><br />Vagn is taken in by Gorm, a powerful Viking who wants him to marry his daughter...Helga the Homely.  Vagn is horrified.  He is being held nearly prisoner unless he agrees.  His problem?  Helga is no longer 'homely.'  She is tall and gorgeous.  But a little on the independant side and thinks he is his big mouth brother who teased her as a child.  Vagn is further perplexed when Helga tries to seduce him but wants no marriage, can he keep his wits?<br /><br />Like I said, both great tales, but one was a little more interesting than the other.  Vagn was a lot more warm and charming IMO and seemed to miss Toste a great deal.  Helga was more fun to read with her insane schemes to seduce him.  They had such passion and sympathy for one another, it was hard to miss, these two deserved an entire book to themselves.<br /><br />Tracy Talley~@eally a 'nun' in the sense, she has been at the Abby for nearly 15 years now and hasn't taken her vows.

But this time she took a Viking WOMAN warrior who is 6 feet and athletic with no qualms about telling the men to take a hike and is in charge of her own army as the heroine.  Wow...I am impressed.<br /><br />She is rude and crude and even scratches...parts at times, but Tyra, Warrior Princess is very aware she is a woman.  Especially when she spies dear Adam the Healer.<br /><br />Adam from the 5 previous books in the series has been a funny and sexy secondary character, but now he meets his match in Tyra.<br /><br />Adam is a healer, trained by Rain and Selik (main characters from 'The Outlaw Viking'-2nd book in series) and runs his own orphanage, but has taken a vow of celebacy since the tragic death of his only family, his sister Adela.  He wants nothing more to do with the healing arts and is furious when this Viking woman warrior kidnaps him and takes him to the Norse Lands to heal her dying father, the King.<br /><br />What begins as anger and fury, turns into curiosity and attraction for Adam.  Tyra is a fierce and different woman who may be capable of changing his mind about medicine and life.  Maybe he can start over?  But who could start a life with a woman who lops off heads of men?  I mean really?<br /><br />Tyra on the other hand is used to men ignoring her and when Adam, this gorgeous god from the Saxon lands seems extremely attracted to her she is dumbfounded.  What in the world does he see in HER?  She's too big, too loud, too obnoxious and too manly.  All the maids are drooling after him including her sisters and he is looking at HER!  Hmmm, maybe she should flirt?  No, she already made a bargain with the randy Saxon, to sleep one ngiht with him if he saves her father and if he dies?  Then she lets him go.  No sleeping...she can't decide if she is sorry or glad.<br /><br />This is trademark Hill Humor.  Ms. Hill makes Tyra very insecure as a woman, but turns her into a very strong and vital vixen for Adam.  I loved it!  All the secondary characters from the other books are here and funny as ever, especially Tykir from 'The Bewitched Viking' and Bolthor the World's Worst Scald.  We are also introduced to a new character here, Adam's assistant, Rashid, who is obsessed with getting Adam a harem and possibly asking Tyra, the man-woman to be the first houri, lol.<br /><br />The antics and scrapes are all classic Hill and funny as ever and IMO, one of her best.

This is the first historical I have read from Ms. Jackson.  Its a medieval tale set in Wales during 1283.  Classic tale about a brother set on revenge and uses his sister as bait.  It begins fast-paced and soars through, never letting up, always interesting, but it seems to end abruptly.  I wasn't ready for the ending so soon when it seemed like some of the major conflicts were yet to be resolved.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed.  I was disappointed mainly because the entire book was set on betrayal and backstabbing and who was backstabbing whom.  Questions were continuously raised throughout the novel about who has caused the mess and continued to be the Judas.  But when we get to the crucial section of the person or persons responsible, we are left wondering if we missed something important because I was never satisfied with the answers.  It doesn't make much sense.  The reasons aren't clear.  Some of the character development seems choppy and a few characters we never get to know too well.<br /><br />In all, if you have this bit of info, just sit back and enjoy a fast-paced read that is entertaining and spans a total of 3 days with loads of action.<br /><br />Lady Apryll is forced to help her brother scheme Lord Devlynn of Black Thorn to get what theirs at one time by using her mother's wedding gown and appearing as if out of nowhere at his castle during revels.<br /><br />What begins as a simple distraction to steal jewels, turns into a nightmare of gigantic proportions.  Apryll's brother has more on his mind than jewels, he wants the Baron's son as a hostage.<br /><br />Now Apryll must flee before she is drawn and quartered for her deceit and find out why her brother lied.  If she gets out alive that is.<br /><br />Devlynn's plan to punish the witch who duped him and took his only son finds his heart isnt into it and has a hard time taking her in hand when she seems to be telling him the truth about her brother's deception.<br /><br />Can she persuade him to trust her when all she's done is lie thus far?  Will her brother destroy the fragile hold she has left on her life if he harms the Baron's son?

Written back in 1991, the age doesn't show as most books do from other authors in that same time period.  A brutish hero and somewhat dim heroine.  These two were very strong and very much worthy of a novel.<br /><br />The hero was strong yet vulnerable and lovable.  He made the reader wish he were real and we rooted for him constantly.  He never took advantage of the heroine nor was selfish or mean, he was just plain perfect...in the sense that a hero can be 'perfect' without being a softy, boring moron, lol.<br /><br />Ms. Mason really hit the mark here.  As with all her heroes, she always manages to turn them into these gods that we the reader wish we could reach into the pages and bring them out.  Jess Wilder, former US Marshall and now Texas Bounty Hunter is that man.<br /><br />He's got his demons, but he never takes his eye off the ball and turns into a ...excuse me, but, jerk.<br /><br />The heroine was far worthy of Jess.  She was good and kind and never whiny nor flighty.  Ariel Leland impressed me with her wit and courage and showed the kind of determination I imagine a lot of women of her day did on the ranches in Southwest Texas.<br /><br />Their love was very real to the reader.  In all, I liked this book a lot.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I felt the villains were so interesting, Ms. Mason should've fleshed them out just a bit more and given them more parts in the story.  They were very impressive and intriguing.  I was left needing to know more about them.<br /><br />Ariel Leland's stagecoach is attacked by bandits and she is found by bounty hunter, Jess Wilder.  He mistakes her for one of the two bank robbers and killers back in San Antonio, Ms. Tilly Cowles.  Apparently, Ariel looks identical to her and was even traveling with the two, but now, no one is there except her and she is shackled to the sheriff, who is dead now.<br /><br />What's more frightening is the fact that Jess is attracted to the murdering witch who claims to be another.  This wont work, he has to get her to the Marshall and find her lover.<br /><br />Things get hairy when everything seems to go awry for Jess and it turns out, his hunt for the elusive Tilly and Dillon for the past 2 years is in vain, this woman isn't Tilly.  Now what?  He made a solemn promise to his dying brother to hunt them down.

It's a great story of one man's mistake and how he almost loses the woman he loves. <br />I enjoyed the heroine a lot, but the hero was a little too domineering for my tastes, but it didn't take away from the story too much.   <br />I just found it hard to imagine liking this guy never mind falling madly in love with him like the heroine did.  He is borderline stalker and seems more or less obsessed with her rather than in love.  At times he is downright scary and I started to wonder in the back of my mind if he would flip out on her.  Now that I said that, the heroine is very strong and very likable.  <br />  <br />Tessa Conway is caught unawares when the top troubleshooter for her company, Brett Rutler takes an interest in her romantically.  He is everything she isn't, overbearing and surly.  What she doesn't expect is to fall for him and fall hard. <br />Brett isn't seeing her for his own pleasure.  He is looking for an embezzler in the company and needs information from the one woman who seems to know everyone and works closely with the money.  Neither does he realize what he is up against.

The heroine is so ridiculous and out of touch with reality that I actually laughed out loud at the things she said and did. <br />The fact that she is in Mexico during 1986 during some kind of rebellion and trying to smuggle 9 orphans out was pushing it, but when she waltzes into a seedy bar and grabs the first drunk man she finds to help her with these helpless kids I had to laugh. <br />She not only forces this poor guy to help her, but she ruins his life and destroys his things to get her way when he is trying to leave the war torn country before he is killed.  I wanted to shove her down a hill and tell the hero to run, lol. <br />The 'romance' scenes were a bit much considering the circumstances and really based on fantasy considering they are 11 helpless people trying to get out of a country crawling with rebels.  This hero kind of surprises me at times for being someone who was in Vietnam, Cambodia, and so forth and can't seem to get his act together here in Mexico.  He was almost like the heroine in that aspect. <br />The characters didn't convince me they were meant to be together and the heroine's lack of intelligence and depth made it seem all the more uninteresting.  The hero deserved better IMO. <br />If you're new to Sandra Brown, skip this one and try another of her better ones.  This is an older book and the writing shows it age. <br />  <br />Kerry knew she taking a chance trying to smuggle 9 orphans out of a hostile country on her own, so she takes a chance and 'coerces' the largest and most disreputable man she can find in the bar to help her cause. <br />Linc is NOT happy about what happens to him and how he is tricked, but he can't seem to turn away from the helpless woman and the 9 kids.  He knows he is going to pay for this and pay dearly. <br />  <br />Tracy Talley~@ <br />	2004-10-01

This was definitely a very different romance from Ms. Howard.  More of a mystery/thriller with some underlining romance, but definitely a great read. <br />What impressed me so much about this story was the research that was involved about the Knights of Templar and the Ark.  It was fascinating and kept me flipping the pages until the wee hours of the morning.  This was a little known area of history for me and I was enthralled.  The whole idea that the 'great evils' of the world are connected to a far greater purpose rather than their own greed.  Ms. Howard puts religion and history and blends it with an unforgettable romance into clear perspective here and does it well. <br />The heroine was very strong, as are all of Ms. Howard's heroines and someone you would know next-door.  She was average and loved her job of being an archeologist.  Kind of nerdy, but it only made her more real and I LOVED it. <br />The hero is very intriguing and mysterious.  His devotion to the 'Order' and why he keeps his promise to be the 'Guardian' is heartfelt.  Not to mention sexy as sin, lol.  By the way, these two sizzle off the pages when they unite. <br />  <br />Grace the archeologist was stunned to uncover a mysterious set of documents from 1322 and began to decipher them when suddenly someone is after her and her entire world comes crashing down around her through two horrific events that will leave her unraveled and on the run. <br />Could Black Niall from 1322 be connected to these mysterious documents?

The hero is not perfect and the heroine is FAR from being any kind of perfect which I loved LOL.  Ms. Hughes also did a little role reversal here with the characters.

The emotional ride you're taken through is heartwrenching.  Ms. Baxter did her job well, as she always does.  These two characters were very real and very hurt. <br />Its hard to come by a novel where the hero and heroine are so intuned to one another and when you read their conflicts and joys you feel the emotions with them. <br />I highly enjoyed this one because of that, although my rating would've been higher had the villain been scarier and more threatening. <br />  <br />Husband and wife, divorced 11 years are thrown together once again when one finds herself caught in a blackmail murder plot and her ex-husband is the Texas Ranger on the case. <br />Years after trying to forget one another after a very tumultuous marriage and a horrifc tragedy, Juliana Reed has finally gotten through the worst part and gotten her life back on track, but when her friend is murdered and she is somehow pulled into the strange and complex case via men with knives and some book they want, she is loathe t0 put her trust in the one man who destroyed her life so many years ago, her ex, Gates O'Brian. <br />Gates is a Texas Ranger and a very good one at that.  Although he hasn't yet gotten his life completely straightened out, he has made progress.  What he doesn't need is his ex-wife coming into the picture again.  His heart cant handle it.

People are willing to murder her to get this book, can he survive anther emotional ride with her?  Can they forget the past and maybe start anew? <br />  <br />Very good book, not to be missed. <br />  <br />Tracy Talley~@ <br />	2004-09-27

It had a lot of potential but seemed to lack development somewhere.<br /><br />The character of William Donovan was well fleshed out but the heroine Viola was vague.  Sort of like an afterthought to the storyline.  She was strong in the beginning and we were getting to know her then she seemed to vanish into a weak-willed girl without depth. No match for strong William.  He deserved better IMO.<br /><br />The only thing that disappointed me in William was the fact that he supposedly loved Viola and adored her from afar all this time and then when she goes to him in desperation and offers herself as a mistress for money he accepts.  I was curious to why this deep and godfearing man would let a woman he so adored and cherished and respected go through with this without offering her some other task to earn enough money to leave?  It left me cold.  It said a lot about his character IMO and I would've enjoyed the story much more had he acted on his respect and then let nature take its course.  There seemed to be a lack of true passion here between them and I never accepted the fact that they fell so much in love by the end.<br /><br />Viola's character really took a nosedive IMO when she thought throughout the book about her 'so loved' brother and then when she sees him she seems preoccupied and nonchalant.  In all, Viola left much to be desired in a heroine and William was too much man for her.<br /><br />All those looking at this as a 'historical romance' beware.  It is more of an erotic romance set in the West.<br /><br />Viola Ross was desperate after her money ran out and her husband murdered on the Arizona frontier she goes to sexy as sin William Donovan, an Irishman who has a business in town and quite a bit of money to offer herself up for sale.<br /><br />Donovan has longed for Mrs. Ross from afar for a long time and is shocked when she approaches him.  Not able to deny her he accepts for a large sum and three months, never knowing that he will face numerous dangers being around her and possibly being killed.

This was an excellent older book!  Written in the late 80's it definitely has the broody guy with a chip on his shoulder and the independent woman trying to come to terms with her independence and love for the hero but this one was a little different.  The heroine doesn't change to suit the hero!  Yippee!  I LOVED it!  The hero also didn't change, but they both LEARNED to become better people and to love one another as is. <br />Very emotional at times and very romantic, these two characters literally sizzled off the pages!  They felt so real to me that I had to wonder if In actually was intruding on some adventure.  It's rare to come across a story that brings you so deep inside that you loathe to end it and this one just ended way too soon for my tastes.  Just under 250 pages it should've been longer. <br />  <br />A plane crash leaves two people stranded in the Canadian wilderness without food or shelter and with the oncoming of winter's deadly storms.  One an independent and beautiful woman from LA and another a broody and angry loner from the Sierra's and not long out of Vietnam. <br />  <br />The chemistry is unreal here, Ms. Brown really took these two and fleshed them out.  Kudos to her for touching on the war and POWs.  More needs to be said about their great courage and sacrifice.  And thanks for not making the heroine a whiny & complaining rich heiress.  Its refreshing. <br />  <br />Tracy Talley~@ <br />	2004-09-23

This was right up my alley.  The suspense and twists were a crowd pleaser and the ending was superb. <br /> <br />My only gripe and its not a big one, was the fact that it took so long to get into the story. Too much chatting and not a whole lot going on until the middle.  But Ms. Black sets it up well.   <br />By the middle it suddenly picks up steam and takes off for the roaring finale. <br />I have to admit something here, I ALMOST didn't finish this book on the fact that I was somewhat bored in the beginning, but I stuck with it seeing the potential and knowing she had to have it pick up and it did, so stick it out its worth it. <br />Some of the twists she throws are new and I was pleasantly surprised she touched on certain topics.  She's an author that isn't afraid to write about particular subjects and takes an interest in researching.  Her heroine isn't perfect nor is she the most gorgeous woman alive.  Her hero is what a hero should be, flawed, yet lovable. <br />For an erotica suspense, Ms. Black sure knows how to add the romance and character development which is lacking so much in erotica, kudos and here's spoonful of pistachio ice cream to you!  ;) <br /> <br />An erotica thriller about a surgeon, Dr. Nikki Adenike who places an S&M add on the net only to find a serial killer awaits and answers. <br />Now she must pray and rely on the only person who can keep her safe and help her, Detective Thomas Cavannah who seems to have a personal vendetta against this killer calling himself Lucifer. <br /> <br />Definitely steamy and be ready for the graphic scenes and language.  I also loved the relationship between Nikki's best friend and her stepmother, its one of my favorite things about this story. <br /> <br />Tracy Talley~@ <br /> <br />	2004-09-21

This is by far the 'hiking bible'.  Every trail you can think of in this jampacked 500+ page book with 4 maps is here!  Little hikes to backpacking hikes for days and days...its all here. <br />The details are rich and very accurate.  The levels of difficulty I found very on the mark. <br />I used this book to plan my first hike up Mt. Washington via, Tuckerman Ravine and it was invaluable.  It was very accurate and when I reached the top, I felt if I hadn't had this book, I never would've tried this scenic and challenging trail.  I would've missed out and taken the less interesting Jewell Trail! <br />We went back and did it again a month later using this book and took the Ammonoosuc Trail and my goodness...was I glad we did.  The scenery was breathtaking... <br />We've done probably about 50 or so trails from this book so far and they were ALL very detailed and informative, with info on difficulty which I like very much. <br />The book gives alternate trails to the same places and where the AMC huts are and shelter.  Mileages and information on dangerous spots.  Even whether to try it in slippery conditions. <br />Don't hike without it! <br /> <br />Tracy Talley~@	2004-09-20

I have over a dozen books on hiking in New Hampshire (my favorite state and place to climb) but this has to be one of the few that really gets detailed on the trail's good points and bad ones and what to watch for. <br />The trails are varied, some long and more of 'getting there' attitude and some short but very scenic.  The authors really let you know about spots to stop at and why and other neat things to watch for.   <br />I have done at least 12 of the 50 and plan on all if I am able in this short life, lol.  No complaints about the descriptions.  Also very pleased with the accurate info on parking and directions to the trailhead, which is confusing in some other books. <br />This is the second book to the 50 Hikes series for New Hampshire, both are unbelievable and invaluable in their information.  This one takes us from Barrett Mountain in Southern NH (which by the way is impossible to find informative hiking information on)through the Whites and even one in the Far North.  There are quite a few essential 4,000 footers in here, so don't miss out! <br /> <br />Tracy Talley~@	2004-09-20

Once again Ms. Howard transcends the romantic/suspense genre with her newest and IMO one of her best novels.  This is an untouched and mostly avoided subject in this genre.  The fact that the heroine suffers a great blow when her infant is abducted in Mexico and sold into a baby-ring.<br />I have not read any other romance author breach this unspeakable crime that is such a problem!  What I loved about this story was the fact that Milla, the heroine, did not come away 'unscathed' and did not whine and become weak for it.  She became fierce and determined and so inspiring.<br />I wouldn't label this particular story 'romantic/suspense' in the fact that it didn't have too much suspense, it was more of an intense drama with a little romance thrown in.  Not that that is a bad thing, lol, its great.  But for those looking for something along the lines of her previous novels labeled the same, such as 'Now you See Her,' 'Mr. Perfect' and 'Dream Man,' this is a little more like 'All the Queen's Men' in its drama aspect.<br /><br />Milla Edge never imagined her life could so completely fall apart so fast as it did one hot and nightmarish morning in a tiny town in Mexico when her infant son was snatched from her arms and she was attached so viscously she thought she'd die.<br />With only her doctor husband to save her she took months to recover and by then, it was too late to find her son.<br />Gone.  Into thin air.<br />Milla could not live with herself knowing he was out there somewhere, so with her newfound soul strength and determination, she let everything in her life become nothing, including her husband and began a relentless search for the truth and uncovers a baby-smuggling ring far beyond what she imagines.  She starts a small volunteer group called 'Finders' which she needs donations to fund and helps others find their own lost ones and in the meantime still searches for her son.<br />Ten years later she gets a lead....<br />Danger and corruption are everywhere and one name whispers to her in the chaos.  James Diaz.  Is he the one eyed man she needs to find to find her baby?<br />Diaz is no more than a terrified whisper among the criminals in and around El Paso and the border towns.  Determined to find him, Milla risks her life to find the 'Tracker' as he is known as.<br />Soon she teams up with Diaz, doing anything to find her son and never questions what he really does for a living but suspects it isn't legal, but he is her only hope.  Unraveling a twisted ring Milla finds this goes beyond just small criminals, it reaches above the highest groups.<br />With only Diaz for help she infiltrates this seedy establishment and is about to crack it wide open, but not before a lethal assassin has her in his crosshairs...<br /><br />Calling all you Linda Howard fans, this is another winner!!!  The heroine is very real and very determined.  It is rare that I admire a heroine as much as this one.  She is so selfless I was impressed.<br />Diaz is so compelling and myterious you will find yourself trying to figure him out.  Very worthy hero to our heroine.  Kudos to you Ms. Howard!<br /><br />Tracy Talley~@one name whispers to her in the chaos.  James Diaz.

I am being generous when I give this one 2 stars, because it deserves one, but in seeing how it was well written and the only thing I didn't like about it was the fact that the characters were unlikeable and the storyline was bland, I couldn't bring myself to completely trash it.  I am a HUGE Linda Howard fan so you see why I am surprised and reluctant to toss this one, even if it's her worst IMO.<br />The brutish 'hero', if you want to actually call him that, is so overpowering that I felt smothered by his presence in the book, never-mind the heroine.  He was completely irrational and borderline stalker/nutcase.  He had nothing worth liking and I couldn't fathom why the heroine even thought much of him, never-mind loved him at all.<br />They marry 7 years before and only live together, if that, for like a year at most.  Most of that time he is gone on journalism assignments in Africa and South America doing God knows what while she is at home and worried to death, but I wont go into that irritating part of the story.<br /> He dumps her without a backward glance because in his words, 'you aren't woman enough for me.'  Again, I won't go into it, I don't want devulge the storyline too much.<br />He calls her a sorry 'kid' and pretty much breaks her heart to pieces and leaves her alone without a backward glance for over 7 years.  Not only is she alone now, but she has no job and no education.<br />Thinking to better herself, she enrolls in school and becomes a reporter for a famous magazine.  She is well respected and loved in her circle.  Life begins again for her and she is happy once again never thinking her estranged husband would destroy her newfound peace.<br />All this time passes without one word from him and he doesn't even worry how she was or if she was even dead or alive while he runs around the world with models and so forth, using his being married as an excuse to not get serious with these unsuspecting women.<br />Then Fate steps in and comes crashing her new life like a tornado.  Her husband has purchased the magazine she works for not knowing she works there.<br />Well, soon he finds out and boom, suddenly she belongs to him and wont give her a divorce.  He takes her off assignments and refuses to let her work.  She must become his sex slave for his enjoyment simply because how dare she refuse her 'husband' his marital rights???  Not to mention he still is dating a model in the open...<br />The heroine Sallie is weak and far from 'Independant Wife' material.  She caves in on every issue and makes excuses for his behavior over and over again to the point of agony to the reader.  She never stands up for herself or even tries to put this loser in his place.<br />Even in the end when he tries to redeem himself I found it really hard to swallow. I was left feeling sorry for Sallie because he will never let her go and she is like a trapped animal.<br />Stalker.  Nutcase.  Creep.  Only words that can convey how I felt about him.  At times he is mean and downright violent to the point of being borderline abusive and crazy.  Obsessive and wacko.<br />Take a look-see if you are a diehard Howard fan, if not, skip it!<br /><br />Tracy Talley~@s in and comes crashing her new life like a tornado.

I do NOT like to knock a Howard because she is one of my FAVORITE authors, but this heroine was way over the top in the 'stupid department.'  I realize this was written in the 1980's when the heroine was expected to be shy and reserved and virginial, yet strong and independent, but she came out as stupid (wince...I am so sorry Ms Howard) and very, very unbelievably ignorant of men and the world in general.  She gave off this 'kill 'em all' attitude that just was nausiating to me.<br />A 29 year old spinster extrordinaire with a knack for letting the readers and the hero listen to her moronic and irritating dribble about her uptight and weird Aunt Ardith's rules of conduct got to be too much for me and I just lost any respect for her or why the hero Wolf would even like her.<br />A few of the secondary characters called her 'goody-goody' and I have to agree.  She was a little too perfect and old fashioned for her age.  Wolf deserved much better.  The naivety was so bad that I was shaking my head and laughed outright when Wolf whispered a 'dirty' word in her ear about the sex act he'd like to perform on her and she had the gall to act confused and ask him what it meant and to show her.  Whatever.  Anyway, this is the 1980s, not the 1880s.  Come on, get real.<br />This is the first in the Mackenzie series, which includes MacKenzie's Mission, MacKenzie's Pleasure, MacKenzie's Magic and A Game of Chance.<br />Mary Elizabeth Potter is a spinster in every way imaginable.  The clothes and the 'sensible shoes' she wears.  She has no idea if she will ever fall in love and doesn't look for it.  Things change when she volunteers to go to the small town of Ruth, WY as a schoolteacher.  She is a great teacher and puts her whole self into teaching children.<br />One child gets her attention, Wolf MacKenzie's son.  She must convince his father he belongs back in school, not at home working.  Getting stranded on his mountain wasn't her plan, but nevertheless, Wolf comes upon her and thinks she must be an idiot.<br />Mary proves that his son is made for more and tutors him.  Wolf realizes he can love again, even if he is an ex-con half-breed.  But the town doesn't approve and lets them know.<br />Can they get past the racism that simmers below the surface and be accepted?<br />Tracy Talley~@thinks she must be an idiot.<br />Mary proves that his son is made for more and tutors him.

I come from a large Italian family and the character's family's traits were so similar to their comments and beliefs and criticisms that I thought for certain this would make me crack up and I did, for the first two chapters, but somehow it started to taper off.<br />The situations began to get a bit much and the heroine was IMO a little too good for the hero.  The friend Annie, which coincidentally is the character for the sequel, 'What to do About Annie' was just annoying.  I couldn't get past her weird tendencies long enough to like her.  The constant going back and forth of 'pow' and 'zing' and 'oy vey' that was supposed to be hysterical got tiresome in the least.<br />The romance between the hero Dan and Mary the heroine was unconvincing and almost boring.  Dan got on my bad side right from the beginning when he thought the woman who owned the restaurant he criticized in his food article was 'short, fat and had hideous red hair and a mouth like his '97 Explorer,' which wasn't true, we never figure out who he is talking about anyway and it definitely is NOT Mary.  I am guessing he means Annie, but IMO it was shallow and he was unworthy of being a hero.  Especially when Annie is supposed to be the heroine of the sequel.  So in other words, Mary's new boyfriend thinks her best friend in the whole world is 'short, fat and hideous'.  Nice guy.<br />I also noticed the author seemed to try to convey a similar writing style to Janet Evanovich which I thojght was ridiculous.<br />Even though I wasn't crazy about the hero and the story became riddled with forced humor, the writing was decent and the author did try.  It was clear she comes from an Italian family herself.<br />Mary Russo is unemployed and her huge Italian family is driving her crazy.  She has no love life and no social life.  She decides to open her own Italian resteraunt without the blessing of her family and recieves a blow immediately when a 'food critic' and former sport's writer says her resteraunt was lousy and that the food was noting great.<br />Mary is furious and goes after this critic, only to discover that he is gorgeous and there is a weird attraction brewing between them.

Growing up in New Jersey myself, I was thrilled to read about newly turned Bounty Hunter, Stephanie Plum, Hungarian-Italian from Trenton who previously worked for a lingerie company.<br />Hysterical and witty and so much fun you will wonder as I did, where I've been all these years NOT reading this series!<br /> A friend of mine recommended this 11 book series (as of 2004) but I was a little skeptical, being that sometimes as you probably know, some 'comedies' tend to be 'unfunny.'  Too much unbelievable action sequences and dialog that it makes you harumph and wonder what the author was thinking.  I too thought this was one of this unfortunate group, but no way!  This was one of the gems in the long, long line of comedy/action/mysteries.

Max is in no way able to have a normal life now and does NOT want a baby.  Can she make him see otherwise and heal his heart before its too late?<br />This was an 'okay' tale of love lost and found, but the constant 'whining' and 'pity trip' that Max was on the entire story tended to weigh it down immensely.  It got tiresome and before I knew it, I was bored and ready for Eliza to move on.  The immediate love between the two also didn't wash with me and came off sounding more like a forced romance.  There was too much backstory here to make a 'short story', it felt clipped and choppy...2 stars<br /><br />Stella Bagwell- 'Baby on Her Doorstep'--Caroline Pardee is stunned when she discovers a baby on her doorstep wrapped in a blanket with birth certificate and all.  The dad?  Unknowing neighbor Joseph Garcia.<br />The heroine came off as very 'preachy' and unlikeable.  Rarely do I find the heroine unlikeable in a story, but here I was hoing the hero would wake up and take his baby and get out before it was too late.  They were mismatched and it was clear why she was still unmarried and alone after 'all these years', in her words.  She was a nag and preachy and acted 'holier than thou' too many times to count.<br />I found myself talking out loud during the book and saying things like, 'Who are you to preach?&quot;  &quot;You never had a child, get off your high horse!&quot;  &quot;Ho was he supposed to know how to take care of an infant?&quot;  &quot;At least he is trying you jerk!

Its hard to find such depth and emotion, true emotion in a romantic suspense, but this had it.  I loved the way the writer Ms George touched on a very sensitive subject in this and made us wonder in the end how it would turn out.  There was no 'I knew it' or 'so typical' in this one.<br />Written in more true and realistic form, it impressed me at her use of several touchy subject matter that I found refreshing in a romance novel.  One being the heroine wasn't perfect nor was she flawless.  She was flawed and real and I loved her.<br />A different spin on the good twin bad twin storyline.<br />Abby St. James finds herself suddenly at the mercy of a company her father has built and her twin has run without a safety net.  Her sister is none other than the 'Black Widow,' or also known as Michaela St. James, three-time widow to old men...old rich men that is.<br />Abby is nothing like her conniving and deceitful sister who loves money and men and designer everything.  Abby is shy and reserved and every bit the 'country mouse.'<br />Taking over her sister's designer shoes for a while in the trendy magazine called 'Bastian,' she comes face to face with Michaela's adversary and the very man her sister detests.  Also the very man she has dreamt about for nealy ten years, Stephan Massari.<br />Stephan mistakes Abby for her evil twin and soon Abby feels stretched beyond her limits.  Despite his adverse taste for the hateful woman, he seems oddly attracted to the 'new' Michalea. And soon he feels she is playing a deadly game with him.<br />Abby soon realizes impersonating her twin is not only dangerous with Stephan, for the man seems like he is about to snap, but another deadly game has begun...someone else seems determined on ending her sister's life and doesn't know who she is.<br />Can Abby get through this alive?  Is her sister's hide worth this trouble?  How had she made so many enemies?  A list a mile long is forming and the more the killer contacts her, the more she must trust to reason with Stephan, the only person who may be able to save her.<br />Creepy and enthralling.

I was constantly on edge and nervous for her.<br />Fran is an abused woman with a little boy in tow and on the run from the very man that may kill her.  Married 18 years and most of them not happy memories, this nurse is finally strong enough to leave the situation, but fears she will be caught.<BR>The reader feels her pain and frustration the whole way through.  Numerous flashbacks and told from first person, this is so unbelievably powerful and eyeopening, that I recommended it to everyone I knew.<BR>Fran doesn't come off as being whiny or 'feel bad for me', she comes off as being so incredibly strong, yet very vulnerable and real.  Someone you would know.  She doesn't try to turn her young son against his abusive father, yet she doesn't try to pull the wool over his eyes either, which I thought was refreshing.  Robert, her son, isn't out of control or misbehaved so there isn't the 'irritating child' factor you see so much in novels.<BR>Fran must go under an assumed name and identity and start her life over at 38.  Being married to her husband for 18 years and knowing nothing else but him and his demands, she finds it hard at times to adjust and move on, but soon she realizes that life is full of unseen opportunities and possibly a new lovelife.<BR>But will her new life come crumbling down after one tiny misstep?

This is an oldy and thought it would be a goody considering Brown's work thus far, but I do have to remember, this was written in 1981 and seems to show the signs of it also.<BR>A very blah tale of a woman who is caught in a love triangle and in love with two men.  The problem here IMO is the too quick romance between the woman and the first man and then how she cuts it off unexpectantly, then the reason for it doesn't wash with me.  It left me quirking my brow in wonder that any average reader would be satisfied with that excuse.<BR>In all, the romance and love between the woman and the men are quick and flat and I felt there was no real love between any any of them.

A first from this writer for me, this story about a girl who overcomes all odds in a world which shuns and torments her is so heartfelt that it will make you believe in happily ever-after.<BR> <BR>Annie Trimble is alone in her solitary world of heartache and loneliness.

I was nearly DYING to read Zarek's story and when I did, I was blown away!  We meet him for the first time as the crazy Darkhunter who is exiled to Alaska in the second book in the series called 'Night Embrace', but we soon realize there is a lot more to this intriguing Hunter than what is shown.<br /><br />Nearly 900 years in exile in Alaska, before people lived there, before the States were formed and before anything resembling humans even walked in the frozen state, Zarek made the gods furious for a deed that he cannot even recall well.  Being a former Roman slave and being shunned by all, he is used to being alone, but a taste in New Orleans in which he was called to help Talon (Night Embrace) made him aware just how lonely he is.<br /><br />About to be destroyed by the god who created him, Zarek is ready to die.  His only savior?  His immediate boss, head Darkhunter Acheron of Parthenopaeus who believes in him and knows without a shadow of a doubt that Zarek is innocent of the horrible thing that happened that night and caused his exile.  He is even willing to pander to the god Artemis to save Zarek.<br />Artemis agrees, only if a judge is sent to judge him.  If he is found innocent, then he is to be set free, but if not?  He will be destroyed.  Who do they send?  Astrid, the god of truth.<br /><br />Astrid is blind in the human world and needs the help of her friend in the form of a wolf.  Coming upon Zarek by accident in a snow storm, bleeding and helpless, Astrid will determine if the most damned man is worth saving.<br /><br />What she discovers is beyond anything she can imagine and soon she is desperate to help this tortured man.  But can she save him before its too late?  Can the unlovable be loved?  Will Zarek open his heart after all these centuries?  Is it Fate that throws these two unlikely souls together?<br /><br />So touching and so romantic, I was blown away by this latest installment!!!  We yet again meet a few more Hunters and more information and history on them all.  We are becoming anxious for Acheron's tale now...

Sounds very intriguing and hard to put down, but I found myself bored and waiting for the interesting parts and was let down.<BR> <BR>The main character Grace Sutter is in a fateful plane crash on an icy mountain in the middle of Maine.  Her only companion is the only other survivor a large man named Greylan MacKeage.<BR>With the sheer help of this man, she survives the crash and trek down, barely.  What they find is a love that was destined to be by the stars above and Grey is a little older than she thought...far older....is he her destiny?<BR> <BR>That about covers it.  She is a rocket scientist and seems to harp on this fact.  IMO, I thought it was a little rude to point it out DOZENS of times and make it seem as though the 'simple' people in town were just that, along with her sister who lived such a 'simple 'life.  <BR> <BR>The romance between the two was too fast and seemed to come out of nowhere.  I wasn't convinced in the end they were so fated to be as one and still never warmed to their 'love' for one another.<BR> <BR>Grey is very vague.  We don't get to know him very well.  Kind of cardboard-cut-out character.  Big, strong, Highlander from another time comes to find his destiny.  Nothing really interesting about him or his past.  He comes off as a little too domineering at times and then too one dimensional.  I can say I don't really know who he was or anything about him other than where he came from...vaguely.<BR> <BR>The mystery in the story isn't much of a mystery and seemed thrown in like some last minute ingredient that doesn't mix well.  There are loose ends that never get tied and I was left feeling frustrated and lost and mostly bored and uninterested in reading the sequels.<BR> <BR>Tracy Talley~@	2004-03-31

Then about 30 or so pages in, wow...it was awful and I wasn't even into half the book.<BR>It went from 'okay' to downright stupid.  The characters were so off the wall I had a hard time believing it was the same book.  Unreal situations and off the wall fights and arguments brought the story to a new low.<BR> <BR>New York Interior Designer Jennifer King moves out to GA after an illness leaves her incapable of going back to her former job.  There she meets a cowboy who offers her a job in Texas on his ranch after doing some temp secretary work for him.<BR>She was warned about Rett Culhane, with good cause.

She becomes determined to find out but to hide what she used to be from him since she is everything he despises.(you know, an independent woman with a college education)<BR> <BR>Sorry to be so blunt, but that is the gist of it.  He hates her for being educated and having a job and life before moving out there.  It makes no sense.  They fight and leave one another and they just seem to go about their lives and then come back together and she doesnt really think much of his weird reaction.  The fights come clearly out of nowhere and I found it amazing that she was even interested in him.  He is a brute and I was confused because this was supposed to be in the 80's.

So emotional and deep, this book is become one of my all time favs.  I love how Ms. Anderson makes the situations so real and different from the typical.  No one is rich and well off and their problems are very real and not simply well, not to be blunt, but trivial.<br />Sometimes you read some romances and they make it seem as though the problems are so trivial and easily solved if the characters would just stop and pay attention.  Not with Ms. Anderson and I am glad.  Its a breath of fresh air.  These are REAL problems we ALL face and even if we don't all face them they are serious enough to warrant the angst and worry in the story.<br />The heroine is strong and the hero is not overbearing and dramatic.  He is REAL.  He is your own husband and your father, brother and someone you would really meet.  Not a conjured character.  She makes them so real, you feel as though you know them.<br /><br />In this book, Chloe Evans leaves a tough past behind to bring her child Jeremy to a new place to start fresh.  A tiny place called Jack Pine, Oregon.  But all is not well in Jack Pine, even though from the outside all seems quiet.  A horrible past and poison is lurking in town and trying to keep Jeremy safe from her own past, Chloe goes to the only man she thinks can help her and her son, Ben Longtree.<br /><br />Ben is by far not to be befriended.  Long a go he was rumored to have murdered a man and possibly murders people that step onto his wilderness property.  He lives with his ill mother and in isolation with the injured animals that come to him mysteriously.  Once a veterinarian, his past destroyed what was left of his practice.  So when red-haired Chloe comes to him for help with her son, he is angry.  They must be trying to turn him in for the animals on his property.<br /><br />As time goes by, Ben realizes that Chloe is just the balm for his battered and tortured soul.  Fate threw them together and he just may be able to start anew.

A nearly 1500 year old Darkhunter and former Celt Chieftain.  He hasn't thought about that horrible night he became one of the undead,  but now after meeting a woman named Sunshine in an alley after getting run down by a Mardi Gras float, he is thinking back to that fateful night.<BR>She is everything that is good and pure and everything he has to avoid.  All he ever wanted since his cursed fate was chicory coffee, which is adores and warm tasty beignets and his best friend to chat with on his cell phone.  what he DOESN'T need is this newest complication.  Yes, the eccentric woman saved his life from the float and helped him when he needed it badly, but she can't remember where she put his pants and now he is stuck in her apartment until sundown....with alfalfa sprouts and tofu to eat!  She seems to forget everything and is a bit flighty at times too.  Talon still can't find enough reason to run from her...and this is disturbing.<BR>The more Talon is around her, the more he yearns for his former life...what he had.  Why does he feel like he's known her forever?  Nothing makes sense anymore.<BR> <BR>Funny as usual and packed with action and soulwrenching romance.  Kenyon sure knows how to pack a punch in this department and her creativity and imagination are really to be commended.

I've read all but one, Ronda Thompson before and was happy with them.  I was really unhappy with this set of stories that are all based on the supernatural.<br />They were mainly very blah and nothing to get excited over.  The best in the batch by far was Sherrilyn Kenyon's, and the worst was either Ronda Thompson's or Maggie Shayne's.<br /><br />Amanda Ashley's 'Darkfest' was very different.  It reminded me of a fairytale the way it was about a strange man who lived on a mountain in a dark castle that the town's people below feared but needed for survival.  A girl in town was blind and her family needs his help to save the mother who is dying, so he demands the girl in payment.  Soon they fall in love and there is a dragon and magic and all that goes with it.  It was okay in the sense of being interesting, but far from being a good typical Ashley tale.... 2 stars<br /><br />Sherrilyn Kenyon's &quot;Phantom Lover&quot; was in all the best story and for those diehard fans of her work, which I am, its worth the book just to read the tale of the Dreamhunters and how demons steal your desires and creativity and how the Dreamhunters keep you safe.  Not directly related to her Darkhunter series, but if you know the novels and follow the stories, you will enjoy this story about Erin McDaniels and her fear of falling asleep and how a certain Hunter comes to her rescue...but who really needs saving?...4 Stars<br /><br />Maggie Shayne's &quot;Under Her Spell&quot; was something of a miracle that it got published, IMO.  Farfetched and really boring to the point of barely being able to finish.  The 'white witch' who falls for the darkside because of a too-handsome man  she encounters.  Skip this one...  A little too contrived and hard to swallow...1 star<br /><br />Ronda Thompson's &quot;A Wulf's Curse&quot; was a tiny bit better than the Shayne story, but it too lacked any fire or interest.  Unbelievable and too artificial for my tastes.  Bring in an arranged marriage, a runaway and a traveling circus and a beast tamer who is other than he seems and you got yourself a Disney-like tale that falls flat....1 Star<br /><br />Tracy Talley~@al for my tastes.

Nothing is as it seems, as in real life and Ms. Lovelace hit it on the nose in this tale about military coverup, power, secrets and steamy romance.<br />I was impressed with her military know-how seeing she served 23 years in the Air Force as an officer made the story that much more realistic.  This one reminded me of a John Grisham novel with steamy romance added to the mix.<br />She's a sexy and beautiful Lt. Colonel who commands the 552 Air Control Wing out of Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahama.  Brenna Duggan is a career officer and her record is as clean as a whistle.  She does everything by the book and is highly respected throughout the ranks.  So what could shake her judgement in the military?  The night her phone rings and she gets a strange call about an airman in her squadron who was found dead in a Panama bar, but was not in the line of duty.<br />She begins having serious doubts about the death; too many questions about why the handsome and cocky ex-military pilot Dave Sanderson is linked to the death.<br />Bringing up too many unanswered questions, she is ordered to drop it, but she is even further baffled when she senses the military is trying to cover something up.  Putting her entire career on the line, Brenna steps into the dangerous limelight digging for clues.  Everything becomes awash in gray in her once black and white world.<br />Nothing makes sense.  Nothing adds up.<br />Her dangerous attraction to the loose cannon pilot that seems in deep in this mess is not helping matters.  She could lose her heart, career and her life.<br />The suspense keeps you going throughout the book and was very accurate with details of military life(military brat here for 24 years-also military spouse for 6)I was truly impressed with this book and would recommend it to anyone looking for a suspensful read with some truly noteable romance(well done Ms. Lovelace, whew  :) )<br />Tracy Talley~@cy Talley~@	2003-08-13

Filled and I mean FILLED with too many characters to make much sense. The secondary characters filled way too much space in the story that the reader loses interest. The main characters do not get enough 'screen time' to fully develop and you're left feeling empty and as if you've missed a few chapters somewhere along the way.<br />Disappointing...<br />The plot of the heroine being an ex-nun got old and tedious after the author kept harping on that fact and reiterating that she was so 'innocent' and sweet and somewhat of a martyr. I lost interest in her character and never really got to know her much better later on.<br />The hero was too messed up to be interesting and needed a serious shrink, not an ex-nun to heal his wounds. I never bought the back story on his reason for S&M and the torture chambers that filled his basement.<br />I never could accept that the heroine would find him interesting or sexy in any way. I was left feeling befuddled and confused in the end.<br />The things he does to her would make any woman run, but not 'martyr-Saint-Mary Frances', the heroine of this tale. I also never bought the fact that she would go under cover as a callgirl to find her sister's killer and that no one would think it was weird.<br />All in all, I had a very hard time finishing this book and thought the author had great promise with the plot, but should've taken out the side characters and really focused on the main characters and showed us why we should love them, instead of disliking them.<br />By the way, this is marketed as more of an 'erotic romance', it isn't. Just thought I'd let that out for all those interested...<br />Innocence is all Mary Frances Murphy has. An ex-nun and the only one who can find her sister's killer, she poses as a call girl and infiltrates a secret ring of deception, prostitution and murder.<br />The one thing that will stop her? A man known for his 'torture chamber' in the basement and violent history with women. This is the man she must seduce and trick to find her sister's killer. A man so frightening, the service she works for is intimidated. A man named Webb Calderon. Known for his weird and dangerous sexual appetites and the last person who was with her sister...<br />An empire that can't be toppled and the one person too innocent to understand the depraved depths it goes to to stay secret...<br />can the dangerous Calderon heal his soul with one touch of her innocence?<br />Tracy Talley~@his is the man she must seduce and trick to find her sister's killer.

I mean, wrestling and romance and humor, I thought this was a sure winner, but soon I became bored and downright disappointed.  I am a huge wrestling fan and watch it every week and enjoy the storylines, ect., so I figured I would love this book set about around the same thing, wrestling and the storylines used in the shows with a little real life romance added.<BR>It started off very funny and promising, then took a slow nosedive about third chapter and just kept going and even picked up speed until in the end I was staring at the book in confusion.  What happened? I asked myself.  It was so funny and true to form in the shows!  The author obviously watches the shows too and her knowledge shows through.  So where did it go wrong?<BR>I think it happened when she made the hero Black Jack Hudson too cartoonish and brawny to the point of not being real.  I couldn't tell where he began and where the wrestler persona began.  It was too meshed.  He sort of came off as (wince) big and dumb.  Sorry Ms. White.  I think I know what she was trying for here with him, but it didn't come out that way, at least to me.<BR>The heroine Frankie was a little too...(again wince)airheaded and also cartoonish that I felt she needed a shrink.  Ugh, I hate being so critical, but I felt like I wasted [$$$] on something I barely could get through.<BR>....<BR> This one is better getting used or borrowed.<br />Tracy Talley~@	2003-08-12

'Lake of Dreams' is about two lovers sperated by time and space too many times and must make things right this last time Fate has given them.  Can these two ill-fated soulmates make it right this time?  Or will distrust built up throughout the centuries cloud everything again...  I gave this one 4.5 stars.(characters were well plotted and developed and I was pulled right into their struggle with Fate and found myself nearly crying)<br />'Blue Moon' is a tale about a strange woman living alone in the bayous and the new big city sheriff trying to solve a murder mystery and how she is connected to it.  Is she the next victim?  Or suspect...  I gave this one 4 stars(too short to get involved in the characters lives)<BR>'White Out' is about an Idaho blizzard that strands a young widow at her resort with no help when a stranger shows up at her door with blood stains on his clothes.  Is he the escaped convict the cops are looking for?  Or help in disguise...  I gave this one 4 stars.(The characters could not be developed enough to make this one fascinating, yet it was a typical Howard story where she made it very compelling and different)<br />All in all, they lacked in-depth character development unlike her other novels, yet they kept intact the usual flair she has with words and were page-turners.  Worth the read.<br />Tracy Talley ~@	2003-08-12

This is an older Howard novel for those wondering at the dark matter in parts.  I enjoyed the story for what it was, but had difficulty liking the 'hero' of the book.  He was a selfish and brooding jerk in my opinion.  Sorry Ms Howard.  But I understand why she made him the way he was and what she was trying for.  The story was not about him, it was about Sarah, the heroine and how she overcame odds that were stacked against her and how she could love someone like him.<BR>A heartwrenching tale about a man who marries her best friend when she is madly in love with him but stays silent for years.  The man(Rome) is also attracted to Sarah, but ignores it and goes on to have children with his wife and lives a happy and sedate life until tragedy strikes and takes them away leaving him an empty and angry shell of a man.<BR>Sarah tries to comfort him and finds herself unable to resist his advances.  Thinking she can heal his heart she wholeheartedly gives herself to him and too late realizes he does not want a family again and cannot love her as he loved his wife(Sarah's best friend).  Things go from bad to worse when she finds herself pregnant and alone.  Rome refuses to accept another child.<BR>Sarah shows us how determined and strong a woman can be when the odds are against her and how she comes up swinging.  Refusing to let Rome destroy her she gets back up and makes the best of a very bad situation.<BR>The love and devotion she has for this man is unshakeable and heartwrenching.  Many times I yearned to grab her and shake her to make her see he wasn't worth it.  But she convinced me that she was tied to him unwittingly by her heart and nothing would change it.  Rome never convinced me he loved her enough or deserved her love.  But in the end, he did come around enough for me to sigh and accept him.<br />Tracy Talley~@	2003-08-12

I was under the impression this was a straight love story; vintage Linda Howard, but nope, she brought in a bit of her trademark suspense she is famous for today.<BR>It's not riddled with suspense like her newer books, but it has enough to keep you wondering and a little on edge.  Mainly a love story peppered with suspense.<BR>The heroine Michelle was great.  She is strong and interesting and the typical Howard heroine.  Inheriting her father's ranch in Florida is not her idea of a great time, especially when she finds out it has been so deep in debt that it may never survive year's end.<BR>The main problem?  Most of that debt is owed to the broody neighbor John.  John is a hard working rancher that turned nothing into an empire but also hates Michelle's guts.  A few years older than her, he detests the ground she walks on.<BR>Ten years have gone by since they last saw one another, yet the hate and anamosity has not disapated, its grown.  Grown into something too big for the both of them to handle.<BR>Michelle must swallow her pride and hate and offer John something to save the ranch in place of the debt since she cannot pay it.  But what John has in mind just fans the flames.<BR>Hate turns to unbridled passion and need, but something is lurking in her past that threatens to come to light.  Can she stop it in time?

I picked this up since it had three promising military romances(which are tough to come by)and was further impressed to see Merline Lovelace's name as one of the three authors and further so seeing Linsay McKenna and Rachel Lee(whom I did not know wrote military romance).  What I ended up getting was a very mediocre book containing stories hardly based on military and mainly romance.<br />Now I am a big fan of romance, so don't get me wrong, I was just expecting something more detailed in the action and drama department considering the authors.<br />The first by Rachel Lee ' Dream Marine' was pretty good and kept me turning the pages but lacked real developement, enough so to leave me wanting more of a story in the end and ending up disappointed.  It was a little slow at times, but the back story was interesting.  A love story about a Marine coming home after spending a harrowing time in the Middle East and a fellow Marine recruiter trying to make him open up.  This tale I give 3 Stars...<br />Second story was Merline Lovelace's 'Undercover Operations'; which turned out to be the gem in this book.  Full of action and military know-how she's known for and sprinkled with enough redhot romance to be complete, but again, I felt I never really got to know these promising characters and they deserved a longer story.  A tale about an Air Force Colonel's daughter trying to find her stepsister who is taken hostage down in Central America.  Her only hope?  An ex-pilot who flew the Stealth in Desert Storm with a very large chip on his shoulder and former friend to her father.  I give this tale 4 stars...<br />The last story was the worst in my opinion. 'To Love and Protect'; Linsay McKenna gets rave reviews for her action-packed military romances so I thought I was in for a treat here with a 'stranded at sea' scenario.  It was flat and the characters were so misguided and irritating that I struggled through their bungling romance.  In the end, I began to hate them, especially the heroine and that is not a good sign, lol.  A tale about a divorced couple forced to work together to find an undercover agent at sea and crash in the middle of a terrible storm and become stranded on a raft.  Forced to talk and face each other after 5 years, the two Coast Guard officers realize they still love one another.  My biggest gripe with this story is the whining and nagging heroine who I wished at times would get thrown from the raft to leave the hero in peace.  Constantly bringing up events from their rocky marriage over and over and still over again to the point of me wanting to pull my hair out(and hers too)I was stunned that the mild-mannered hero could listen to her at all nevermind consider trying to work things out.  He deserved better Ms. McKenna.  I give this tale 2 stars...<br /> For an example of good work from Merline Lovelace, check out 'Line of Duty', it's excellent.  Rachel Lee's 'Under Suspicion'.<br />Tracy Talley~@the heroine and that is not a good sign, lol.

This is truly a complex tale filled with heart-pounding suspense and a serious whodunnit atmosphere that will keep you guessing.<BR>There is some graphic violence and gritty sex scenes, but the story would not be the same without it. <BR> A tightly woven tale about three very different sisters summoned to their childhood home in a tiny town in Oregon by the lake to their father who is about to run for governor but needs to ask them about a deep secret the sisters have been keeping between them for the past 16 years.<BR>The eldest sister Miranda is an attorney and controls the three sisters and is the main keeper of the 'secret'.<BR>Claire is the middle child who is recently divorced and has two children.

The second book in a line of books which I didn't know was a series until I began reading it.  It began with 'Unsung Hero'.  But you do not have to read 'Unsung Hero' first, I understood what was going on and Ms. Brockmann doesn't leave us hanging and confused what-so-ever.<br />Apparently all her books have three or more stories weaved into one and they all converge somewhere in the end or middle.  I usually hate these types of books due to the back and forth tales and never really getting to know the main characters very well, but she seemed to accomplish this very well and I am impressed.<br />Meg Moore, the heroine is desperate and will so anything to save her daughter and grandmother who have been kidnapped by terrorists calling themselves the 'Extremists'.  Knowing the United States refuses to negotiate with terrorists from her job as a translator in the European embassy that same logic will kill her daughter and grandmother.<br />How far will a desperate mother go to save her small remaining family?  Meg is not above taking a foreign ambassador hostage in the embassy at gunpoint to force the government's hand at helping her.<br />Navy SEAL John Nilsson is called on an emergency to help the FBI negotitate with an irrate woman holding an ambassador hostage.  When he arrives straight from a training mission he is stunned to learn she had asked for him by name and she is the one woman he never forgot all these years, Meg Moore.  Why was she doing this?  This was insane and so unlike her!<br />John must stop her and save her before the FBI takes her out to save the ambassador.  First he will have to delve into what is making her tick.  Finding that little piece of information will take hours and hours of talking and gun pointing and some moments where John knows he will risk his life and his career to help and save Meg from her own Fate.<br />Action, drama and some very tense moments where you aren't sure what Meg is capable of fill this compelling book.  A mother so desperate and so out of hope, she will kill to save the ones she loves, even herself to save them.  I was so in awe of her strength and determination and loved John.  He is her soulmate, truly.<br />The other two stories were as fascinating at the main one.

This book was amazing with a capital 'A'.  Ms. Kenyon(also known as Kinley MacGregor) takes vampire lore to a whole other level!<br />A unique twist on Buffy the Vampire Slayer's Slayer Legend and Charmed's Hollway three witch sisters legend, Kenyon tackles vampires that come in various different breeds.  Some worse than others and a &quot;slayer&quot; of sorts created by ancient gods to destroy them called Dark-Hunters.  These Dark-Hunters also suffer the same disadvantages as vampires and posess no soul, but they are good at heart and are made when they are served a severe injustice and their soul cries out so loudly that the Greek god Artemis hears and grants them a chance at vengeance if they turn their soul over to her and join her army of &quot;Slayers', or Dark-Hunters in this case.<br />Blessed, or cursed if you will with the same disadvantages and same advantages, each Dark-Hunter must keep humans safe from the Daemons that run through the night stealing souls from the humanrace.<br />Action-packed and full of funny quips and twists, this is one of the best books I've ever read.  Hard to put down, its sure to make you chuckle in parts when we meet the heroine of the story Amanda and her wacky family of witches, vampire-hunters, voo-doo priestess's, and the like.  Amanda herself just wants a &quot;normal&quot; life with nothing paranormal.  Even if it means marrying a very boring and very unattractive man who works with numbers as she does, she just can't handle anymore &quot;weirdness&quot; than she already has to handle from her family.<br />Ye gods are laughing because she finds herself dumped by the said boyfriend after meeting her essentric family and in the &quot;dumps&quot; if you will until she goes to let her sister's dog out to the bathroom one night and remembers nothing but waking up handcuffed to the most gorgeous man she has ever seen!<br />All in black leather and long blond hair, Kyrian of Thrace was taken by surprise and finds himself handcuffed to a human who thinks he is &quot;yummy&quot; or &quot;yummy man in black leather that needs to be licked&quot;, or so her thoughts scream when he looks at her.

I read this book not knowing it was the sequel to 'Shades of Grey', yet it isn't marketed as such.  So if you haven't read 'Shades..', do that before reading this since the main characters do not take up many pages in the book, but the main characters from Shades do.  In other words, this book should've been advertized as the continuence of Grigori and Marisa's life, not the emergence of a new vampire he'd made named Edward Ramsey.<br />Edward was supposed to be the main character and driving force in the book and possibly a little scarier than Grigori, but nope, I wasn't convinced.  Edward was too whiny and selfish to be a hero.<br />His being a former Hunter of Vampires and coming from a great line of Hunters I was hoping for something very impressive, but what we got was complaining and him feeling sorry for himself.  Grigori saved his life in the pervious novel, thus making him what he is now and all he does is blame the vampire and lash out at him almost the entire book.<br />Edward's obsession with Marisa is kinda weird and after awhile we the reader start to wonder why Grigori saved him afterall.  The love interest Edward is supposed to be going for is a broken woman named Kelly who tries to kill herself and he saves her.  In return she stays at his house and keeps an eye out for him while he sleeps.<br />I liked Kelly and thought she deserved a better hero.  Edward was too selfish for her and tended to grate on my nerves.  Thankfully the author started out with him in almost all the chapters, then moved away from him and Kelly and went on to put the light on Grigori and Marisa for the rest of the book.  Which was a great deal.  We get to see what happens to them and their new relationship.<br />A very good book, very well written and with lots of action.  My only complaint was the main characters Edward and Kelly; could've done without them.<br />Edward Ramsey spent his life hunting the very thing that he has become.  His conscience is screaming for him to end it all, but somehow he doesn't have the will.  Things start to change when a desperate woman tries to end her life and Edward must save her.<br />Kelly gives him reason to live on, even as a monster.  He needs her love and kind heart, but she's been hurt and trampled on too many times.<br />An ancient evil is in town too.  A merciless, yet stunning creature named Khira.

The main characters were somewhat mediocre and flat, especially the hero Pierce.  The heroine was much more interesting and I was finding myself hoping something would happen between her and the 'badguy' since he was much more interesting and exciting.<br />Pierce spent way too much of the book whining about his dead wife and how he can't love again, blah blah blah and I began to get irritated with the strong and fiesty heroine Brianne who kept waiting for the idiot to come around.  He didn't deserve her waiting or love.  His reasoning was so farfetched and unreal at times that I just shook my head and sighed.  I was truly hoping Brianne would slap him a few times and take off with the secondary character Tate.  Now HE was a man to wait for, he he he...subsequently he is also in the next book called 'Paper Rose', his story.<br />Pierce came off as whiny and weak and we were never really sure what he did with the oil business, it was too confusing.  The secondary characters were great and I found myself hoping they would take over the story.  CIA and other secret organizations played a big role in the plot along with foreign governments, ect.  The plot was good and very developed, what was missing and left a big hole was the main characters.  They seemed mismatched and misplaced in its complex web.  I found myself enjoying the action going on around them and the movements of the secondary characters, even the badguys much more.<br />'Once in Paris' is a tale about two people who run into each other and fall in love, but neither will admit the mindblowing fact.<br />Pierce Hutton was too grief stricken and empty to realize there was life after his spouce's death.  Coming to his rescue one night in the city, Brianne Martin, an 18 year old kid in school who seems to let him know without words that life can go on.<br />She was far too young for him and she knew he was too old for her, but their hearts didn't know the difference.<br />A year later, Brianne is caught in a web of political scandal and her stepfather is about to turn her over to a man who has no scrupples.  He simply wants her and will have her at any cost. Never forgetting that night in Paris, Pierce comes to her rescue and leads them into an adventure she never dreamed filled with danger and chaos.<br />Can she heal his broken soul?  Can he save her from a madman bent on destroying her?<br />Tracy Talley~@e.<br />A year later, Brianne is caught in a web of political scandal and her stepfather is about to turn her over to a man who has no scrupples.

I am a huge fan of action-packed romances, especially ones with rainforests and badguys, etc, and I thought I was getting another winner here, but nah...<br />Boring and so typical at times that I wondered if I was becoming a mindreader and could foresee the plot.  The heroine was definately not worthy of the hero and I even felt sorry for him.  He on the other hand 'in real life' could not have been a real agent with the way he gave himself away so many times and did things so 'not in the rules of conduct'.  In other words, I WOULD NOT want these two romping through the jungle in an effort to thwart the badguys for the good of this great country.  I would rather I go instead.  They were far from capable of doing the job or anything romotely dangerous or risky IMO.<br />The heroine Allie goes on a quest(she's kinds ditzy and the blonde jokes the author tells inbetween ironically fit her to a T, go figure...) to find her best friend's killer.  She ends up an unwilling passenger on a boat carrying deadly cargo and deadlier men on their way to God only knows where.  Her only hope?  A mysteriously great looking guy who tries to keep her safe named Jake Dawson.<br />Jake isn't what he seems immediately in the fact that he protects her and tells her the only way for her to survive is to become his bedmate.  In theory that is.  When in fact its a facade.<br />Before she knows it, Allie is becoming way too attracted and dependent on Jake.  Running for there very lives in the steamy Mexican jungle and dodging bullets and revolutionaries, these two must trust the other to make it out alive.<br />Allie does some really dumb things at times and you start to pray that Jake throws her overboard in an attempt to save himself.  What made the story so irritating was the fact that the heroine was so unbelievably weak and needy.  Not to mention ditzy and just downright stupid(sorry to be so blunt).<br />And he end doesn't get any better.  She just causes more trouble and does more ridiculous stuff and then she actually tries to get us the reader to believe that she is so bright and belongs in this line of work?  God I hope not.  I would hope the government and the powers that be keep people like her out of this line of work for our safety, if not just hers, lol.<br />In short, this is an 'okay' read and probably better picking it up used and not new.<br />If you're looking for action-packed jungle romps try out Linda Howard's 'Heart of Fire', now that is definately worth the $ and time and by far a shelf-keeper.<br />Tracy Talley~@iculous stuff and then she actually tries to get us the reader to believe that she is so bright and belongs in this line of work?

What I thought would be a very different type of story turned out to be a typical romance with nothing new to add to the genre.<BR>It bogged down in some parts and I found myself sighing and glad it wasn't that long of a book.  Not typical for me reading a Brown book.<BR>The romance was contrived and the heroine was likeable at the beginning, but I lost interest in her halfway through.  She got on my nerves with her 'past grievences' and hangups with the hero.<BR>The hero was very likeable and I have no real complaints with him per say, except maybe that he came on too strong considering the circumstances.<BR>I could see the plot easily and figure it out from about the second chapter how it was going to end and that disapointed me.  <br />The heroine Leigh finds herself stranded alone and in labor on a deserted stretch of Texas highway when a dusty and rugged looking stranger pulls up to help.<BR>Losing her husband eight months before, she isn't ready for another man in her life, but the gods seem to think otheriwse and place Chad Dillon in her path.<BR>Having a husband who was killed on the job, she was looking for a 'safe' man, not the mysterious guy with the gorgeous blue eyes who seemed to be hiding his profession.<BR>Keeping his past a mystery, Chad attempts to heal her broken heart, but can love conquer the thing that keeps her from him?<br />Tracy Talley~@	2003-07-14

What she finds goes beyond the crazy fiction she writes and what she finds is not only a sexy sheriff who seems to be hiding something, but a whole town of weirdies.<br />But that's the least of her problems right now.  The house the company has leased for her seems to have been the scene of a murder and still bears the blood stains and not to mention the weird story that goes with that.

This author is new to me and I am entralled by her wit and writing.  She adds just the right amount of humor and romance and doesn't clutter the story with unnessasary junk or filler.  Just plain ole fun and old fashioned romance with of course a very sexy and funny hero to die for and oh yeah, a heroine to be proud of.<br />In this humorous tale, a new age hippie named Gabrielle Breedlove finds herself being arrested in the park jogging right after she sprays her 'stalker' with hairspray for following her for days.  How was she supposed to know the weirdo smoking and jogging on the trail was an undercover cop?<BR>Joe Shanahan is trying to decide if this woman who thinks auras and karma is plain nuts or just essentric, or just a way of deceiving the public into thinking she is innocent of stealing priceless antiques.  His job?  Pose as her boyfriend and hired hand in her antique/hippie shop to nab her business partner and friend for stealing a Monet recently.  In return she gets immunity.<BR>Things aren't as easy as he'd planned.  They never are in Joe's case.  Attraction to the crazy woman is not something he plans but gets anyway and now he is starting to think she is honestly telling the truth about not knowing anything.<BR>While his mother and sisters trying to find him a wife and his parrot Sam learning his vocaulary from Jerry Springer shows, Joe has enough problems at home, he doesn't need this flighty woman trying to tell him he is making bad karma by spying on her partner.<BR>Gabrielle doesn't need a big muscle man with bad karma and a red aura intruding on her peaceful llife anymore than she needs a hole in the head.  Then why is her 'pychic' mom telling her he is the man in her future?  Her yang?  Impossible.  Or is it?<br />Hilarious and well worth the time and money spent!  A true gem.

Very funny and fast-paced, I was thrilled.  Full of action and adventure, I couldn't put it down.<br />A former supermodel and a black ops agent stranded together you say?  With a anklebitter dog named Baby?  Naked pictures of the said model on the net, but not your typical ones...kinda embarassing actually....very embarassing...so much so that the supermodel finds herself taking a much needed vacation to get away from the laughs she is experiencing behind her back.  Not to mention the tabloids calling her 'fat' and 'heavyweight' after she's gaining 25 pounds.<br />What Lola Carlyle, ex-supermodel and owner of Lola Inc., a lingerie company doesn't expect is her friend's yacht to get taken hostage by a beaten and bruised crazy-man toting a gun demanding she be quiet and sit down and keep her little 'rat' away from him as he takes the boat out to sea!<br />Things can't get any worse for Max when the crazy-woman on the boat turns on him in the middle of the ocean and fires a flaregun into the controls and fries the engine to stop him.  And he also just then realizes she is the famous supermodel Lola Carlyle!<br />Dead in the water, the two begin to fight like cat and dog...not to mention the little 'rat' that keeps trying to assert his authority by biting Max's leg.  With threats of throwing the rat overboard, Lola rethinks her strategy for attack and finds herself unable to do anything.<br />With druglords after him and a government that refuses to acknowledge its existence, the black ops agent Max Zamora must get back to D.C quick before they finish him off this time.  But how?  The boat is dead and the controls are fried...a storm is brewing, and not just outside, but between the stranded castaways also.<br />Can Max save them both?  Does he want to?  Attracted to the crazywoman, he can't help but feel responsible.<br />Lola will need to trust the crazyman to survive, as long as she can keep her hands off of his sexy body.  Why?

This is a early book from Ms. Brown and written in the 80's for those out there who were curious.  The hero was what made me not like this story as much as I would've.<BR>He was very broody and unlikeable in his manner and personality.  I think she was trying to portray him as being very mysterious and lost, but he just came off as mean and illogical.<BR>His whole reason being that his father sold some land for money for the reservation and the people swindled him and closed down a silver mine that the reservation needed.  The hero, Hawk, is determined to get it back, even if it means kidnapping a woman and her child to force the hand of the senator.<BR>Hawk is so angry for the plight of his people that he mistreats the woman and pretty much emotionally abuses her simply because she is white. (Mind you, he isn't all Native American and he even went to a big college in the city so the hate doesn't make sense in the scheme of things.)<BR>Miranda the heroine tries to explain to him that she isnt married to the senator any longer and they hate one another, so he wont help her.  Hawk doesn't see it that way and continues on the collision course.<BR>Love blooms between the two and they find themselves trying to save the mine and themselves. <br />It was an okay read, but Hawk's mistrust and downright hate for white people chilled the book to the point of a mutual hate for the hero from the reader.  The ending didn't make him any better a person in my eyes and just confirmed my dislike.  My sympathies are with Miranda and her son for putting up with the guy.<br />Tracy Talley~@	2003-07-08

First up is Linda Howard's 'Duncan's Bride'.  Mind you, this was written late in the 80's, so the content is 80's male chavanistic romance; which I am not complaining about by any means, its just a different style of writing, but some people are sensitive to it, so I thought I might warn those out there.  But anyone who's read Howard knows even her older novels are amazing and worth the read.<br />Extremely heartwrenching and full of distrust and turmoil, the two characters worm themselves right into your heart.  Mail-order bride Maddie moves to Montana answering an ad in the paper from divorced Reese Duncan who is looking for a hardworking wife to live on his failing ranch with him in name only.(note, this isnt a historical, its based in the 1980's)  What he gets is a beautiful woman who drives him crazy and surprises him with her heart and devotion.  Maddie makes it her mission to heal his bitter soul and to become more than his wife in name only.  I give this story 5 Stars.....<br />The second is by Elizabeth Lowell called 'Chain Lightening'.  A woman named Mandy has lost everyone she loved in a horrific plane crash over the ocean years ago and is still reeling from it.  Her boss tricks her into taking a much needed vacation to the Great Barrier Reef hoping to heal her wounds, what she doesn't expect is to get shacked up with enigmatic Damon Sutter in the process.  Good writing, but I couldn't get myself interested in the story, it moved too slowly for my tastes. The tale was riddled with angst and too much talking.  In the end, I would give it three stars...<br />Third in the book and last was Kasey Michael's 'Popcorn and Kisses'.  Not sure why this story was mixed in with the others since it really wasn't related plot-wise.<br />It was an 'okay' tale about an old drive-in theatre and two mismatched people trying to save it.  It seemed to move very slow and I became bored instantly with the plot and dialog.  The writing was decent, the plot was much to be desired.  Very tame and I have to agree with another reviewer on this being very 'Sweet Valley Highish'.  It did not fit in with Howard and Lowell's steamy stories.  Not sure how the characters had to 'find home' again in this story either, but oh well.  I gave this one two stars...d.

I am stunned.<br />I like Lori Foster and read this purposely because of her.  Her story 'Trapped' was definately not her best work by a mile.  Contrived and moved so fast I thought I was missing chapters, it had no spice or drama usual to a Foster novel.  It lacked character development and story development.<br />Advertised as a firefighter named Ethan Winters bursting into a burning building to save his oldest friend Rose and realizing he loves her madly isn't what it really is.  There is no 'trapped', there isn't even Ethan bursting into anyting remotely burning.  The fire happens in the very end and is over in two pages.  I repeat, NO one is trapped.  Except maybe this story.  Sorry Ms. Foster, you can do better...<br />Second in this book is 'Buried' by Donna Kauffman.  Another yawn here.  Who's buried?  No one is buried in this story!  The entire story is about an earthquake in San Francisco and a rescue worker who supposedly saves a woman 'buried' in the rubble.  She was?  Apparently I missed that entire section because it wasn't in my copy.  Her DOG is buried somewhere and they work together to find it.  What I'm wondering is when rescue workers are assigned to find pets in the rubble during disasters when these things first happen?  Aren't they sent to rescue people first???  Bury this one in the rubble...<br />And third is Jill Shalvis's 'Stranded'.  The only story where the title actually fits the storyline.  But then, they are 'stranded' in the basement, so, go figure.  A storm drives two characters into the basement and they are stuck there until someone can find them.  There solution?  Sex.  If we have sex, we'll be okay.  Okay....brilliant.<br />Men of Courage?  Where?  And there is another book coming out, July 2003!  Skip this and save your money.  The blurb on the back hypes it out to be this exciting and dramatic collection of stories aimed at some of the everyday heroes in our country, the firefighters, rescue workers and doctors.  What we get is a contrived waste of time and money.  You can find more drama watching the news...<br />Tracy Talley~@s a contrived waste of time and money.

I really liked Sage Tyler in the previous two books, 'Lucky' and 'Chase', but she was a little too haughty and bratty in this one.  She's older now and 'grown-up', but she acts more immature in my opinion.<BR>Coming on the heels of the emotinal rollarcoaster ride in Chase's book, Sage finds herself dumped and alone on the porch steps of her fiance; Christmas Eve no less and a chuckling and handsome cowboy named Harlan to witness it all in its humilitating end in the shadows.<BR>Sent by her brothers to come and get her so she wouldn't miss the birth of her newest nephew/niece, this time from her oldest brother and his new wife Marcie, the cowboy and newest worker Harlan Boyd.<BR>Harlan doesn't play games and isn't interested in a spoiled brat like Sage Tyler.  But she somehow gets under his skin like a prickly cactus and tall, blonde and sinfully gorgeous Harlan bites off more than he can chew.<BR>Sparks ensue when both try to hide there attraction for one another and the family company Tyler Drilling is almost in ruins making tensions worse.  But Harlan has something up his sleeve that could save them all.<BR>Can Sage put aside her anyomosity for one week to work by his side?  Can she put aside her headstrong and spoiled ways to see the heart of the man inside?<br />Good story and finish to the series, I was just a bit put off by her bratty self involvement to fully enjoy the story.  Harlan although was great and I truly liked him, and Lucky shined in this book with his off color jokes and humor.  The brothers and mother made it worthwhile.<br />Tracy Talley~@	2003-07-03

Unbelieveable plots and very little vampirism in this collection of wanna-be vamp tales.<BR>I am a huge fan of vampire stories and thought by the little monologue from the book's editor Marvin Kaye that he would deliver us some real horror and scare factor here, but all I found was contrived and boring stories that had little to do with vampires at times and some downright off the path altogether, i.e., the third tale titled 'Sheena'. <BR> Some even read more like porno rather than horror, i.e., 'Vanilla Blood'.  <BR>The only tale that came marginally close to vampires and horror was 'Some Velvet Morning', a tale about a slayer on the trail of a witch who bathes in blood; or in other words, Elizabeth Bathory, legendary witch/vampire from 1500's England.<BR>Six stories in all and none came close to scaring me or being 'what horror is all about' according to the promise from the editor.  If this is his idea of horror and that vamps are bad guys and horrifying, than he needs to brush up on some new stories, because I can recall a few Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes that were more scary than this entire book.<br />The two star rating?  Is for 'Some Velvet Morning', the only tale I would consider worth the read and that's being generous...  do yourself a favor, skip this one.<br />Tracy Talley~@	2003-06-25

What I mean by that is in this book the author takes a quote from the episode 'The Gift' from Season 5 and twists it.  The original quote from Spike to Buffy in the episode went, 'I know I'm a monster, but you treat me like a man.'  It was one of the most emotional moments of the season and showed us how Spike had evolved from something evil and hateful to something good and promising.  It was a defining comment from him and was a preview of what was to come in the 6th and 7th seasons.<br />The author butchered the moment and morphed it into a new one he created himself of Spike telling Buffy in this book, 'I know I'm a monster, but your mom treated me like a man.'  I mean, why would he do something like that?  It didn't even make sense!  Ugh, that being the only thing that ruined a 5 star rating, the rest of the book was pretty well written.<br />Dawn overhears a girl in school being mistreated by the infamous 'sweater mafia', or in other words, the popular girls and steps in.<br />Dawn becomes a target for the group as they seek revenge and Dawn begins to discover weird things about her new friend Arianna.

With unusual superstrength and healing power unknown to a Slayer, Arianna is harboring a dark secret and a dangerous legacy that could destroy everything...as soon as she becomes 16....<br />Written after Joyce's death and Dawn's revelation of being The Key, somewhere in the middle of the 5th season.  Good portrayal of Buffy's struggle to deal with her mom's death and her guardianship of Dawn and her fear of the season's villian, the hellgod Glory finding Dawn finally.  The author also touches on Spike's deep love for Buffy and his struggle to protect her and Dawn and how Buffy doesn't seem to want any of it.<br />Extremely good plot, just get rid of the twisted moment with Spike and Buffy.....<br />Tracy Talley~@id of the twisted moment with Spike and Buffy.....<br />Tracy Talley~@	2003-06-19

Wow...a unique and I mean unique twist on an old legend.  I am talking about the infamous Jack the Ripper.  Nancy Holder does a fantastic job of capturing the essence of the characters in true form and the shaky season(6) the story takes place in.  One of the BEST writers of this series in my opinion...<br />Buffy takes in the help of Spike to track down a killer who appears to be a demon in Sunnydale.  But this is no 'ordinary' demon, remember, this is Sunnydale, the Hellmouth, lol.  Anyways, this demon appears in fog and cold fog.  So cold and dreary that it bufuddles the mind into uncontrollable fear.<br />The strongest magick ever made is somewhere in Sunnydale and the deadliest butcher ever to roam the streets of London is not far behind.  What are the connections?  <BR>Glimpsing a horrific time in England's past, two times and worlds collide as Spike remembers a time when a killer walked the streets of London and got a little too close to he, Drusilla, Angelus and Darla.<BR>Taking up with the Slayer of 1888, Spike and his twisted little 'family' of vampires find themselves desperate to help the Slayer bring down this menace threatening them all.<BR>Buffy sticks by Spike's side needing his help with this new enemy or is it old?  Older than anyone thought...  We get an inside look into Spike's mind of that time and his uneasy alliance with the Slayer Elizabeth.  Why he helped her and how he felt about her.<BR>We also get a small glimpse into the mind of the present-day Slayer Buffy and her feelings about all that's happened since she became the chosen one and her feelings for the badboy vamp Spike.<BR>Very detailed and fascinating.

I was thrilled to finally read a 'stranded on a deserted island' book at last, (they are hard to come by)and was immensely let down.<BR>Slow and off-track, the story begins okay, then takes a sharp nosedive in which it never recovers. <BR> Too many secondary characters getting the limelight for too long.<BR>The humor was forced and frankly...not funny.(wince, sorry)  Too many hillbilly jokes and talk, reminded me of a certain show...in Beverly Hills?  Hillbillies...hmmm...<BR>The hero was supposed to be a nerd, that I expected, but he was just plain dorky, feminine and weak.  Not hero material.  He whined and complained like a teenage boy at times and I wanted to strangle him, lol.  Ther heroine was the true 'hero' of the story.<BR>Not that she was such a deep character herself.  She patronized the hero to death and spoke to him as if she were above him.  Frankly she irritated me to no end.  They didn't belong together.  It was far from the sexy stranded on a deserted island story I was expecting.  <BR>I struggled through this one, or waded so to speak.  <BR>In short, its about a nerd who gets stranded with his dream woman from work on an island in the South Pacific and finds out she is all the woman he ever dreamed she'd be and she finds out he is no nerd who works in the computer room at work, but a sexy and great guy she needs to catch.<BR>Fair warning, the book is taken halfway with her mother's romance and her boss's lives.  Not much 'screen time' for the main characters.<br />Tracy Talley~@	2003-06-16

Well, we met Noah Badwin and his brother Ben in the first book; 'Too Much Temptation' and went on a unique ride with the sexy brother who couldn't stop himself from falling in love with his and Ben's grandmother's secretary, now in the second installment we get to go along for another sexy read with the 'badboy'Romeo brother Ben.<BR>Ben is known for his prowess for the ladies and gets into a few scrapes here and there, not to mention his mutual fights with his grandmother. In sum, Ben is used to getting his way and no one stands in his path for what he wants...until now.<BR>In comes this fiesty woman who's dirty and a little too wholesome for his randy tastes.  Walking into his diner with a chip on her shoulder, she challenges his maleness in ways he didn't imagine anyone could, just with her snide comments and sarcastic wit.<BR>Ben finds himself thinking of ways to show her his most prized skills...his sensual bedroom skills that is.  But the fiercely independant Sierra has her own plans, that do NOT include some Romeo who thinks he can show her a thing or two.  She's got a landscaping business to start and run.  Ben is more of an irritation she doesn't have the patience or time for...or does she?<BR>The more he comes around, the more distance she puts up between them and in the end decides to make him a proposition.  One night of unbridled passion to get him out of her system.  Will it work?  Or will it make things harder?  Past memories come flashing by and Sierra must make a decision...<BR>Extremely good sequel, but my only complaint?  A tiny one...Ben seems to fall too fast too hard and I was a little thrown for it.  The elusive badboy bachelor suddenly falls and begins to resemble a puppy looking for scraps of affection.  A little more resistance would have been good; some hesitation and whatnot to live up to his reputation.<br />Tracy Talley~@	2003-06-16

Sound impossible?  I thought so too until I read it!  The heroine, Grace, is pleasingly plump and shy and can't fathom why a gorgeous guy like Noah Harper, 6'4 with rock-hard abs and muscles, not to mention black hair and penetrating blue eyes would take notice in her.<BR>Noah, seeing shy Grace as a very sexy and curvy woman without much confidence in herself sets to make her feel like the gorgeous and voluptuous woman she is.  The problem?  He can't detach the unbelievable sex from the intense emotions he is feeling for her.<BR>Begun as a way of forgetting his ex fiancee's dalliance with another man and moving on, Noah, former badboy, now reformed by his grandmother to be a well dressed businessman sees his grandmother's secretary as a challenge.<BR>Grace doesn't see it coming and is too late when the badboy sets his sights on her.  Nearly causing a scandal in the small southern town, they heat up the pages and set a firestorm of gossip and anger that will leave you turning the pages for more!<BR>Can a little pact for fun and sex turn into something more?  Can two friends walk away in the end with their hearts intact?<BR>Whew, unbelievable and outstanding, my first from Ms. Foster and DEFINITELY not my last!!!<BR>Kudos to an author who is brave enough to write about a heroine that is true to life and feels good about herself.

Again, very impressed with this 'chapter,' so to speak, in the fascinating vampire series by Ms. Drake.  This tale centers on a 1,000 year old vampire named Ragnor Wulfson introduced as a secondary character in the second book, 'When Darkness Falls'.<BR>He's a former Viking Warrior, son of a powerful leader in his time when he was turned into a vampire by a former lover.

Never trying Ms. Dain before I decided to pick this one up since I adore pirate reads, but this quickly fell short of what I am used to.  It dragged in places and the hero wasn't very likable.  They weren't together most of the book, just at the beginning and near the end.  The middle seemed to be filler with nothing special to say.  Just pages of how Lydia adjusts to life after her wild and impulsive decision to give herself to the pirate captain holding her hostage months earlier.<BR>I have read dozens of pirate romance stories and this is one of the duller ones.  Typical storyline with nothing new to add to the genre.  You can see the outcome miles away without even finishing the book.  The beginning stars out smack dab in the middle of a scuffle between the pirates who want her as she is tied to the mast and then quickly goes into the story with her giving herself to the captain to save herself from rape and murder amongst the others, then we leave the ship just as quickly (within possibly 2 chapters) and the rest is the heroine adjusting to life afterwards.  <BR>Pretty dull in spots and too much talking between secondary characters without much interaction between the main characters with predictable outcomes makes this a disappointing read for me and not a keeper.  If you're looking for some great pirate romances, may I suggest Connie Mason's 'Pirate' for starters?  It's action-packed and filled with twists and turns with lots of heartpounding romance to boot!<br />Tracy Talley~@	2003-03-17

This was a very different and interesting plot than the usual fare.  This is about the Taliban and how one woman becomes trapped in a country exactly like Afghanistan and how one man tries to get her out.<BR>So different from what we normally see in romance, this was brilliant.  Written right before the terrorist attacks, the book almost never was released.  I am glad it was.  Ms Blake takes us into a frightening world where everything is black and white and there is no room for error.  Where women are second class citizens and treated worse than rodents.<BR>This is a tale about an American woman trapped inside with no hope of escape and about her father's last dying wish to get her out.  <BR>Wade is that man.  Former military with the Special forces, he sneaks into the war torn country and tries to convince the woman to leave with him.  Afraid and without hope, she shrinks away from the bold American risking his neck to fulfill a last wish.<BR>With the Taliban onto him, Wade must make a decision, leave the frightened woman behind and save himself, or drag her out against her will and risk being caught.<BR>Heart-pounding and action-packed, this is a must-read.  I stopped short of 5 stars because of the unrealistic ending.  Without revealing anything, it wasn't up to par with the rest of the amazing book.<BR>A well worth read!<br />Tracy Talley~@	2003-03-07

The book was just as funny and original as the movie, although slightly different.  <BR>Some of the scenes were a little different or longer in the book and I liked that.  Other things were explained more in the novel which I was glad.  Reading the trials and tribulations of a singleton thirty-something with boss problems and men problems and a little mix of mom and dad problems was a refreshing read from the usual fare of 'chick lit' I have been running across.<BR>Alot of authors are trying to recreate the magic of Bridget Jones, but they fall short of the witty and most oftentimes hysterical turns of Ms Jones's life.<BR>Bridget is unhappy with her weight, her job, her boss, her lovelife and her bad habits(drinking too much wine and smoking).  Determined to do something about it after New Year's disasterous turkey curry buffet with her mom and dad and their friends, she sets herself up for a year of hysterical twists and turns that lead her into the next Christmas wondering what went wrong.<BR>Written in diary format, we see everything from her point of view and how she thinks and operates.

This is the second on the Vampire Series started in 'Beneath a Blood Red Moon'.  It started out great and I thought to myself, wow, I might like this one best, but then it sort of fell flat afterwards.  <BR>Still a great vampire romance, but lacking the excitement and fire the first one had.  This one details the 'King of all Vanpires', Lucian.  He was introduced in 'Beneath a Blood Red Moon' as Maggie's 'guardian' and mentor.  I really enjoyed his role in that book, and thought him having his own story would be excellent, but he was a little...I don't know...boring?<BR>All that energy and mystery he had in great abundance in the first one was lost in this one.<BR>Maggie makes an appearance in this book and we play catch up with the other characters from that book.  The female lead in this book, Jade, was good, she held my interest.  Frankly, I found her much more interesting than Lucian.<BR>This book was I'll admit a little more scary than the first one and just as violent, which is good, because to make a good vampire book, it wouldn't do to have them all fuzzy and sweet, would it?  So if you're squeamish, then take a pass....<br />Jade MacGregor takes a trip that will burn in her memory for years to come, to beautiful and mysterious Scotland.  She embarks on a group tour that leaves her shaken and fleeing Scotland with vague memories of black hair, glowing eyes and blood and lots of it.<BR>A year later with her memories still chasing her, she begins to feel that night just one year ago is coming back to haunt her.  She survived that gruesome night, now she will have to survive once again before the black night of darkness falls and the creatures come out to play once again...<br />Not as impressive as the first book, but still worthy of the read.

I love Brown's books, but this one was boring and dragged.  Too much info into the character's pasts and the male lead of Wick was unlikeable in my opinion.<BR>He seemed too 'hick' and unintelligent to do the job he was sent to do, keep an eye on a murder suspect for the detective he was friends with.<BR>Being an ex-cop and all, I figured he would know the 'ropes' so to speak and not get sidetracked by stupid things, but not here.  Wick kept 'checking' Rennie (the doctor and murder suspect)out and missing vital clues in the surveilance.<BR>Funny thing was, I almost heard myself muttering about the detective that sent Wick to do the job to be the hero.  <BR>He was stable and intelligent.  He was married, so it kind of ruined that idea, lol, but still, I enjoyed his interaction with Rennie far more than Wick.  At least he knew what was what and didn't get sidetracked by a great pair of legs.<br />Basic story of a woman who served Jury Duty and helped get the killer off simply because there wasn't enough evidence.  Soon she is stalked and tormented by the obsessed man(Lozado)Which by the way was more interesting than Wick too, but anyway...<BR>Wick is sent in to watch her and keep an eye on her since she is supected of the recent murder of a fellow surgeon she didn't see eye to eye with.  What he doesn't expect is to fall for her and be caught in a web of past hates, obsessions and lust.

A very detailed look into Spike's past, which we get a small glimpse of in the 5th Season during episode titled, 'Fool For Love', the book, this book in fact goes deeper into that episode's facts and gives a long look at before his vamp days and right after.<BR>So enthralled in the chapters with his story, I almost forgot Willow's tale was intertwined with his.  Each chapter is told from 1880 London with Spike and then back to 2000 Sunnydale with Willow.  Alternating back and forth.  Just when you think neither story has to do with the other, they are meshed and then both become even more intriguing, which I didn't think was possible.<BR>Willow brings us to her drama class during the 2000 fall semester in college and shows us a weird side to acting.  Feeling like she'd been bitten by the acting bug, she gets very involved in the production of the plays and finds more than she bargained for.  Drama has a link to magick and its not very pretty.

By the end, I really didn't care what happened to her.<br />Cassie Hayes life can't get much worse, her problems with relationships and her caffeine addiction don't make a dent in what's about to happen now.  Her boss at the publishing house she works for as an editor to some of the biggest authors around is making her move in with a Pulitzer Prize winning author who turned recluse about 30 years ago to coax another winner out of him.  <BR>Life gets worse when she finds out the island he lives on contains zero coffehouses, no bagels, and the nightlife is absent altogether.

My second book I've read from my favorite hit t.v show and again, I am impressed!  The writing is great and the characters are so lifelike and true to form.  What I like about the books are the fact that we finally get to delve into the collective minds of the complicated characters that are Sunnydale's 'Scooby Gang'.  A vampire slayer, a watcher, a witch, a werewolf, a vampire, a wisecracker human and a rich girl who keeps getting mixed up with the gang, even if she pretends she can't stand them.  Like the show, the book was beyond entertaining and well worth the money.<BR>This novel, 324 pages, could easily have been a great episode.  It was a very different departure from what we've seen in the show.  A weird group of traveling renaissance faire people that arrives in Sunnydale, CA, (a.k.a, the Hellmouth) who are not only weird, but have something to do with a sinister group of horsebacked, hellhound dark faerie roaming the woods around Sunnydale looking for souls.<BR>The Scooby Gang think a faire would be uncool, but find themselves drawn to the faire anyway and experience a feeling of dread and doom.  Jousting contests, human chest matches, knights and ladies and a court jester that all seem a little too...real.  <BR>Caught up in a whirl of confusion, the gang experience the dark faerie for themselves and find out the faire is the least of their problems.  The Erl King has brought the Wild Hunt to the Hellmouth and the gang must stop them before all the lost souls in town become part of the Hunt forever.

I am a HUGE fan of Buffy The Vampire Slayer and had never read a book on the series and tried one out.  Am I glad I did!  Wow!  Just like watching the show itself!  The characters were true to form and came off genuine.  I could just hear their unique quips and voices while I read.  This one in particular is somewhere in the 5th Season, I am guessing near the middle more or less.<br />For those of you who are fans of the show, it's after Buffy's mom dies, during the height of Xander and Anaya's romance, after Spike's declaration of love but before Dawn's capture as the 'Key' and during Willow and Tara's affair, albiet when Tara began telling Willow she shouldn't be doing so much magick.  My guess, near the middle to end of the 5th Season(the HellGod Glory Season).<br />The plot here?  Big baddies that come in little packages.  Should've been an episode.  A troupe of winged sprites come to Sunnydale to create chaos.<br />Buffy is having a hard time dealing with her mother's death and the responisbility of raising and protecting her 15 year old sister Dawn, not to mention being the Slayer and having to save the world too many times to count.  More problems arise when Spike discovers mini-demons wreaking havoc in Weatherly Park.  Not just that, but she realizes she has no dental insurance and her toothache is interfering in her Slayer duties!  How to combat the problem?  Think small...very small.<br />The Scoobies are doing there best to help her, but Anaya and Xander are being held hostage by a plague of ants, Willow is determined to fix everything with magick, Giles is fixated on a parking ticket, Dawn is desperately trying to fit in somewhere and the smitten vampire Spike is trying to impress the Slayer.<br />Thinking things can't get worse, they do, this is Sunnydale afterall.  Buffy must stop the winged menaces, save the Scoobs, take care of her tooth and keep a lovesick vampire at bay all in a weekend's time.  Too much for the Slayer?  Not at all...just don't sweat the small stuff...literally.<br />Hysterical, creative and action-packed.  True to form.  Fans of the Scoobie gang with Spike as a side-kick will love this one as I did.  I love when Spike came into the scene and became part of the group even though a lot of fans missed Angel, I thought Spike was a breath of fresh air and enticed me to watch every week and I became addicted.  He is true to character in this book, with all the witty lines and 'Spike moments' intact.  All the characters were very well written and I couldn't ask for better.

What he doesn't expect to find is a woman dying from a rare blood disorder living in his old house in Maine.<br />He watches her in the night, coming to her in the darkness.  He wants her.  She is one of The Chosen.  He can take her if he wishes it, but does he want to risk his life?  They are destined.  Both are hunted.  Only Dante can save her from her disorder with his life and love.  The promise of immortality is intriguing, but is it wise?<br />Could've been a lot better had it had less subplot and more action and more Dante.  Morgan was a little much with her obsession with him, but it finally fits into the story later on.<br />Tracy Talley~@	2002-10-28

Truly a woman ahead of her time(1500's), Skye O'Malley makes us proud to be a woman.  Never taking less, she strives for more and gets it.  Even with her beauty, she never stoops low to use it to her advantage.  She gets what she wants with her brains.<br />A very different spin on romance, this isn't for the faint of heart.  Skye isn't your typical heroine with one man or one love.  Bertrice Small is known for her sweeping tales of adventure and unconventional loves.  This is a classic in its own right.<br />I still don't know why people refer to it as a 'trashy romance'.  There is nothing 'trashy' about it.  It's filled with history and greed, passion and bravery that I haven't seen in many romances.  Not a 'lovey-dovey' romance by far, but it is a page-turner none the less.<br />With black hair and blue eyes, Skye O'Malley is the most beautiful woman in Ireland.  Tall and extremely intelligent, she can outwit most men.  Men are willing to die to possess her, but she can't be owned.<br />We are taken on a wild adventure that spans almost ten years.  From the lush hills of Ireland, to the exotic Algerian hideaway and on to the fast-paced London scene.  The adventure never lets up and Skye never lets us down.  A seafaring captain who is rumored to be a notorious pirate who has angered the Queen herself, Skye is too wise to let anyone win a war of wits with her.<br />An eternal love that she must face and two loves that she must remember, Skye O'Malley never forgets what is most important.<br />The information on the Virgin Queen was so unbelievable, I was amazed.  The things that Skye gets away with is frightening.  Brave should be her first name.  Definately a heroine to look up to.  The only complaint?  The men.  Simply put.  I don't want to reveal anything, but I was unimpressed with her men.  Only one I liked alot and he was too far near the end of the tale.  One was okay, another was pretty good, and another was downright disgusting and I could not fathom what she saw in him and the good one was too late in the story.  But I hear the second book, 'All the Sweet Tomorrows' has him as the main character....hmmm, can't wait now to read!<br />The common complaints in this book were mostly mine also.  The men, her unfailing riches and beauty and her knowledge of EVERYTHING imaginable.  But all in all, an exciting book!!!<br />Tracy Talley~@she saw in him and the good one was too late in the story.

The typical Koontz thriller with stuff that will send chills down your spine and told from first person point of view it made it much more real.<BR>This is from a trilogy that I haven't read otherwise, but found it easy to follow and the main character of Christopher Snow very interesting.  He has a rare disease called XP, which makes him prone to skin cancer.  He cannot go into the sun at all and must live his life at night or by candlelight.<br />The story is about him trying to find out how his parents died.  They seemed to die of mysterious circumstances and the things he sees while roaming the night after his father's death sets the tone for the book.  It all takes place in 48 hours.  His entire life as he knew it will change.  The town he loves so much is hiding a deep and dark secret that could distroy him and everything he loves.<BR>The only people he can trust are his surfer best friend Bobby and his midnight dee-jay girlfriend Sasha and his beer lapping-almost-human dog Orson.  Everyone else seems to have some kind of link to this madness and is determined to silence anyone getting in the way.<BR>Can Chris save them all from this threat?  Will his XP be a blessing in disguise or a curse far worse than he can imagine?  The town of Moonlight Bay is about to become an Eden full of snakes of every size and shape.<br />I love how Mr. Koontz makes animals so real in his stories and almost human in a sense.  Not alot of authors do this and its a nice change of pace.  Orson was a blast and became one of the main characters that we cheered for.  The plot was also very different and unique.  Alot of reviewers had problems with the action, but I loved it and became engrossed in the story quickly.  Very surprising and weird, a true Koontz book  :)<br />Tracy Talley~@	2002-10-21

Started out great and went along fast paced until the arrival in Viking Territory.  Then it went downhill.  The plot seemed contrived and I knew what was going to happen before it happened.  After awhile I got tired of it and felt like tossing the book.<BR>How many times can one person be saved from certain death?  I mean, come on already.  Some of the plot and scenes were too far fetched even for me.  More than halfway through the book, neither one can speak the other's language, so there is no worthwhile dialog between the main characters, just an interpeter.  They fall in love too quickly and the heroine, Fiona, is too quick to make major life changing decisions.<BR>The villain is very typical.  All in all, I hate to say, I was unimpressed with this at-first promising book.<br />The daughter of an Irish chieftian has found a way of keeping out of a marriage she does not want.  Her decision(this is what I mean about life changing and too quick) is to let the Viking prisoner in her father's dungeon ravish her.  Ruined, she will be unacceptable for marriage.  But when the Viking refuses her, she is desperate.<br />Delirious with fever and festering wound, Dag Thorsson thinks the woman coming to seduce him is a dreaded fairy.  He must resist her charms.  But after he resists he realizes she is human.  Escaping his imprisonment unexpectedly, Dag captures the beautiful princess and takes her with him home.<BR>Suddenly trapped in a rugged land with nowhere to go, Fiona becomes desperate to escape.  Treachey abound and she can trust no one....except Dag, her captor.  Can love save them both from certain death?<br />Tracy Talley~@	2002-10-21

Not for the faint of heart, Ms. Joyce weaves politics of the time(1069-England) and raw passion so real that you are swept away.  Not a 'fluffy' romance during William the Conqueror's time, but a meaty and controversial one sure to cause some murmers of disapproval.<BR>I enjoyed it very much and appreciated what she was trying to get across to the reader.  Some readers missed the message of the true world of war and upheaval and the odd accountance of passion and love that rises above the carnage.  A very real and serious look into the life of a reknowned knight of William of Normandy's army and how he cannot understand his love for a Saxon woman that can't belong to him.<BR>What would it be like if someone like Rolfe the Relentless were to fall so madly in love with the very woman he was supposed to despise, a Saxon enemy, the conquered...and maybe risk treason to have her...defy a king to be with her...it would not happen to someone so loyal to the crown...or could it?<BR>When Rolfe rides into Castle Aelfgar to claim it and its prize, the Lady Alice as his bride as William has decreed, he finds himself helplessly attracted to Lady Alice's illegitimate half sister Ceidre.<BR>Was Ceidre a spy?  So mysterious was she that Rolfe refuses to see that she aides her nobel rebel brothers and flaunts treason to help them.  He cannot help but feel protective.  Soon he is caught in her forbidden passion, both are caught in a dangerous liason tied to the fate of England.<BR>Can love conquer all?  Can the will of a tyrant king bring down the fires of Hell on the two starcrossed lovers?<br />So passionate and fast-paced, I was at once caught up in the turmoil until the very end.  The sequel to this unbelievable book is 'Promise of a Rose'.<br />Tracy Talley~@	2002-10-17

After trying two other books from her and finding them severly lacking, I was reluctant to try a third.  Glad I did!  Wow, this was full of passion and pageantry during the conquering of William of Normandy(1066). <BR> The Battle of Hastings was the main center for the story and I was surprised since most authors go after the time when William was already sitting on the throne.  This was a nice change of pace. Seeing the battle for England and how determined they were to possess the country.<BR>She makes it easy for us modern readers to understand the battles and beliefs of the time, yet keeps in tact the reality of the place.  Seeing Wales and the islands dotting the sea  through her words was breathtaking.<BR>Brynn of Falkhaar was shocked that she was summoned to tend to a dying man from the Norman army.  Reknown as a healer, she was both anxious to help but also repulsed to lend a hand to the enemy.  The battlefield of Hastings was filled with the stench of the dying and dead.  So much so she felt dizzy.<BR>Brynn must keep her wits and save this man for his friend else she be killed.  But as the nights wore on, she couldn't help but see these men for who they were, mere humans brought into battle for a tyrant king.  But would her pity make her lose what was most important?  Her freedom?<BR>Dark and brooding, Lord Gage Dumont was used to getting his way in all things.  So why did the fact that the Welsh beauty as beautiful as a fairy disturb his thoughts?  She was just a slave.  Yet her kindness and passion defied all logic.  Gage would risk everything he owned and everything he was about to possess to conquer her heart.<br />Very touching and romantic.  I especially loved the ending...very...magical<wink>***<br />Tracy Talley~@	2002-10-17

I would've liked this book alot more had it been more in depth and not so vague and simplistic.  The plot and characters were very promising at first, but somewhere along the way they seemed lost and disjointed.<BR>The story starts off slow and you find yourself wondering when it will pick up, then when it does, it sputters and then fizzles out.  I haven't read anything by this author and this is an old book(1994) so this author may have matured in her writing by now(2002), so I won't judge her.  It just seems as though she wasn't sure and wasn't completely confident about her ability to write an in-depth story with factual information and a compelling look into life in England and Scotland in 1281.<BR>Some of the facts are obscure and we the reader are left with a simple shell of a tale about love and politics that leaves much to be desired.<BR>The author proves that she doesn't know a whole lot about this time period by writing an author's note stating that fact and how she had to add into account that the family she chose(Campbell) was a major key player in the Wars for Independence  from 1296-1314.<BR>She also repeats herself throughout the book with phrases and thoughts from the main characters that seem to just fill up pages rather than add to the plot.  My advice?  Skip this one if you're in the mood for an exciting and fullfilling adventure through Scotland and England's wars with eath other.<br />She was kidnapped right from under her father's nose and dragged to the untamed wilds of Scotland to be the hostage to the Laird of Clan Campbell.  Lady Leonora Waltham didn't expect to fall in love with the barbarian in the process!  How could she not?  He was tall and rugged and he protected her.<BR>Dillon Campbell needed her as his hostage to make sure his brothers were returned unharmed.  He doesn't expect to become enchanted by the spirited English beauty or to fall hard for her either.  He has to decide...love or honor?<br />Tracy Talley~@	2002-10-11

Exciting and romantic, what we come to expect from Ms. Mason's compelling tales of love and triumph.  Filled with politics of the time (1067-1072) and a love so great it conquers all.<BR>Ms. Mason brings to life the times and flavors of the period and brings you right into her world.<br />William the Conqueror's most favored knight, Lord Lyon of Normandy was awarded for great service to the crown an estate worthy of a Duke and with it, it's heiress, Lady Ariana of Cragmere for wife.<BR>The problem?

Very intense in the passion department and filled with romance, 'The Black Lyon' was very good.  My only complaint?  I wasn't fully convinced that 'the black lyon', Ranulf, was madly in love with the heroine Lyonene.  It was clear that she loved him to no end and would die for him, but all I got out of his feelings were intense passion for her and jealousy.  I have to also remember that this was written in the time of bodice-rippers(the 80's, 1980 to be exact)when the male was the dominant character and often pushed the heroine around.<BR>The plot was great and the characters very real and colorful, a true Deveraux novel.  This is distantly related to the 'Velvet' series.<br />The fierce Black Lyon (Ranulf)was rich, devestatingly handsome and powerful.  He was feared by men and women alike, until he came across a brave woman named Lady Lyonene with flashing emerald eyes and tawny hair much like a lion's mane.  The only thing she feared?  Not being able to snare him for a husband.<br />Being one of the King's Earls, Ranulf wanted to make a good marriage, even after his tortured past came creeping up on him and threatened to destroy what happiness he could find with Lyonene.<BR>We are taken through a whirlwind romance and then deep into an intense and stormy marriage.  Jealousy, lies and deceit threaten their love and try their trust.  Driven across the Irish Sea, Lyonene is in grave danger, only one man is capable and able to save her...the fierce Black Lyon.  Only he has the courage to destroy the ruthless plot to keep them apart forever.  <BR>Now Ranulf must believe in trust and love to bind them together once again.

It was good and lots of fun, but seemed to be lacking somewhat in the excitement department.  'Mercy' was so fun and had depth, 'Killjoy' was a bit disapointing.  It seemed to be rushed and 'missed the boat' so to speak.<br />The characters were okay, but I didn't feel attached to them in anyway and forgot about them as soon as I closed the cover when I finished.<br />I don't know what happened, but it didn't seem as though she had as much fun writing this one.  I gave it four stars because the plot was unique and the dialog was great, it moved fast and kept me turning the pages.  But if you're looking for another 'Mercy', this missed the mark.<br />Avery Delaney has grown up knowing she had it hard.  Her mother abandoned her when she was three and left her to be raised by her grandmother and Aunt Carolyn.  Things seemed to not be on her side when at the age of eleven she witnessed her grandmother's violent murder and she herself shot and left for dead.<br />Miraculously she survived, but not without the scars that are deep inside.  Not able to leave the past behind, she grows into a beautiful woman unable to get close to anyone except her loving Aunt and makes her seek a career in law and order.<br />Her sharp mind enables her to secure a job as a crime analyst for the FBI.  She soon needs this knowledge when her aunt contacts her to join her at a mountain spa retreat (after recieving the invitation from her soon-to-be-ex-husband)called the Utopia Spa in the Colorado wilderness for a vacation.<br />Avery arrives but Carolyn never arrived.  She was taken to some isolated retreat on false pretenses by a handsome stranger and Avery cannot find her.  In fact, NO one remembers her.<br />Panicking, she uses her wits to backtrack and scour the area with the help of another stranger who claims to have personal reasons for going after this man who has her aunt for that man is a hired assasin named Monk...<br />Can Avery stop a hired killer from murdering her only family she has left?  Can she trust this stranger who demands to know about Carolyn and is trying to help her find Monk's hideout?<br />Lots of action scenes and some tense-filled moments, but could've been alot better in my opinion.  The gunplay and running in the wilderness should've lasted longer.  The romance betweem Avery and John Paul(the brother to Michelle from 'Mercy') should've been more drawn out and in depth, it just wasn't convincing.<br />Tracy Talley~@<br />Can Avery stop a hired killer from murdering her only family she has left?

Tragedy and everlasting love make this one a classic masterpiece to read over and over.  A little remenicent of Shakespear's 'Romeo and Juliet'.<br />Bestselling romance author Hayden Lane is completely and utterly obessed with her new hero and she doesn't know why.  She is so obessed that she barely notices when her fiance walks out and her friends stop calling.<br />Determined to find out why she is so obsessed, she goes to a psychic(she is convinced this guy has to be real in some way) who informs her that she has a past life that originates in Edwardian England. She was also a woman named Lady de Grey.  The psychic isn't sure which timeline is which since her soul seems to be so dramatic and lost.<br />Fascinated, Hayden begins researching Lady de Grey extensively, what she leanrs shocks her...apparently she was very, very promiscuous and mysteriously disappeared one night and her ghost is said to haunt her husband's home.<br />The psychic warns her to investigate no more.  But Hayden being curious, does just that and more.  She goes to a hypnotist at a friend's dinner party, but the trick goes horribly wrong, instead of remembering her past lives or seeing Lady de Grey, she actually becomes her past body as Lady de Grey!<br />More turmoil abounds and Hayden is tossed back farther to the beginning of her 'soul's birth', Edwardian times...during King Edward's reign, 1200's.<br />What she finds is so far from what she's read about Lady de Grey and alot of history in fact that she is determined to change it.  But can she?  Is the past predetermined?  Is the man she finds merely brooding because he is as cruel as he seems to be or has something or someone caused it?

The bitter irony is, she writes articles on how other people can SAVE money....<br />Becky tries cutting back, spending less, doing odd jobs to make more, but nothing seems to work.  She is in deep.<br />The writer weaves a tale that is so engrossing and real, that I winced when she recieved her bills and I felt ashamed with her when she made excuses and tried to lie to the banks.  I was tense at times when she embarassed herself or got caught in a lie or fabrication.<br />Becky knows she spends too much, but can't stop until something changes her life for good and she must grow up and take responsibility.  We see her hurtle towards impending disaster, fall to the bottom of the barrel and pick herself up again and become a new person.<br />Very entertaining and way too much fun to miss.

Head over heels for this book is almost what sums this up!  I loved it!  Lots of funny scenes to keep you laughing and Ms. Andersen's trademark wit.<br />Veronica Davis is from Fossil, Washington, but you wouldn't know it by what she says and how she acts.  She owns a nice condo in Seattle and has a thriving business that takes her around the world, for example, to Scotland for a year.<BR>Being forced to go home again, Fossil, not Seattle; Veronica is miserable and dreading it.  She worked so hard over the years to forget the small town that drove her nuts in her adolecent years when she was forced to be a waitress at her father's saloon.  Now however extenuating circumstances has made her come back to tie up loose ends and sell the dreadful saloon.  Once the deed was done, she'd flee the town once and for all...what she doesn't expect is to find it being run by ex-Special forces Marine Cooper Blackstock...a little too sexy and hotblooded for her at the moment, but Cooper had ideas about defrosting her blood to match his!<BR>Cooper is undercover and is pretending to be a bartender.  Hard to swallow?  Not in this case.  He looks the part and acts the part, so much so that Veronica really thinks he is a drifter/bartender with no goals, great, just what she needs to complicate her life right?<BR>Things get hairy between these two as a murder investigation makes it rounds and who-dun-it becomes commonplace in a town with one main road and alot of nosey people. Death threats ensue along with too many dangerous secrets the bartender is keeping.  Good thing Cooper is there to catch her if she falls...head over heels that is...Veronica just might find Fossil interesting afterall.<br />This is the first in her new series and was wonderful!!!  I am looking forward to her newest installment or ANYTHING by her!!!<br />...	2002-09-19

Hilarious outlook on a woman turned 34 and living with her mother and aunt with no life.  I was in tears reading this gem.  Funny, funny, funny is about what sums this up!  Right on caliber with her infamous novel 'Mr. Perfect', the right mix of humor, tension and romance to make this one another favorite for me...<br />It's not much of a thriller like her others, but what it lacks in suspense, it more than makes up for in pure humor and romance.  Although, I don't think Ms. Howard intended it to be suspenseful anyway.<br />Daisy Minor just woke up on her 34th birthday with an epiphany.  She needs a man.  Living with her mother and aunt for her entire life didn't leave her much in the romance department.  She was going to change this...and a whole lot more, given the right little touches of course.  Like a new wardrobe...how about some flattering makeup for starters?  Maybe she'd even go as far as turning her mousy plain brown hair into something sexy?  Would this attract a man?  She needed to go one step farther...barhopping...yup, that'll do it.  Not to mention she'd NEVER stepped foot into one, but she was about to change all that...it was open season on manhunting...the only thing she doesn't expect is to be caught up in some murder she'd unwittingly witnessed.  Why couldn't she just have a normal life?<br />Chief of Police Jack Russo just wanted some relaxing work after transfering from SWAT in NYPD to this tiny town that more resembled Mayberry in Alabama when some uptight spinster librarian decides to go off the deep end suddenly and change her life by barhopping and dancing with rowdy guys.<br />He does not need to complications derived from this. Now the niave woman has witnessed a murder and someone wants her dead!  Sworn to protect and serve, Jack takes on the job, but lets the old fashioned Miss Priss gone Mayberry Lolita know where he stands...at least he tries to.<br />Hysterical and so much fun, this one is a sure keeper!  Daisy will have you in tears!  She is so much fun and so different that the usual heroine, that I wish I knew her personally.  The things she does and gets into will make you laugh for days!<br />Jack was equally as much fun and thinks its funny to push her buttons and make her blush.  Tons of witty dialog and many sexy moments, this is a winner!!!  Keep up the wonderful work Ms Howard!<br />Tracy Talley~@er!  Daisy will have you in tears!

A classic tale of high society rich girl with impeccable manners and a heart of gold falling for the alpha man with big dreams and no money but a whole lot of attitude.<BR>It was funny and sweet and I really enjoyed it, although it did drag a little here and there.  I think it was mainly due to the fact that the entire book focused on the hotel she was opening and a few sparse times out and about in New Orleans nightlife.  I wanted a litte more action and trouble like her other book 'Baby I'm Yours'.<br />Prim and proper socialite Juliet Rose Astor Lowell from the Boston Astors is about to open her very first hotel(of a chain out of Boston), what she doesn't need is the protection of surly and sexist New Orleans detective Beau Dupree hanging around to mess her composure up and her life, but Daddy insisted since she'd recieved a threatening letter.<br />Beau is determined not to do this ridiculous job for some prissy rich brat when he has a man prowling the streets to hunt down.  The solution?  Drag her along while he gets information and make her wish she hadn't asked for a bodyguard and with any luck she'd demand he be released from his babysitting duty.<BR>The problem?  Things are more complicated than he thinks and someone really IS trying to harm her.  Torn between wanting to catch the prowler and wanting to help the niave woman, Beau comes to a crossroads.  She isn't as cold and prissy as she projects herself to be...in fact, she's downright fun and passionate...Beau is lost...maybe what he's been looking for all these years is right in front of his stubborn eyes.<br />Funny and the usual witty Susan Andersen dialog, but missing the excitement and suspense of her other books.<br />Tracy Talley~@	2002-09-13

The very first novel from one of my favorite authors and you can bet I was excited to read it and was surprised at the lagging pace it was set to and the more serious plot.<BR>Andersen newer work is known for its witty dialog and funny, quirky scenes between the hero and usually clumsy heroine.  So I was a little shocked to find this one was lacking in those departemnts, severely.<BR>The characters are pretty forgettable and I didn't much like the heroine much.  I would've liked her best friend and fellow dancer to have been the main character.<br />Amanda Charles lives as a showgirl in one of Reno's most glamorous casinos.  She is beautiful, smart and unwittingly the target of an obsessed serial killer.<BR>Detective Tristan MacLaughlin has been asked to come down from Seattle to help form a task force to catch the elusive Showgirl Slayer.  What he doesn't expect is a gorgeous AND smart dancer to mix up his emotions from one look and make him stumble and remember he has to keep his mind on the murder not her.<br />Tristan soon realizes balancing Amanda and the case is more than this stoic cop can handle.  The biggest mistake he will make is getting too close to her...he has unwittingly put her directly in harm's way...<br />If you're new to Susan Andersen, skip this one and try 'Baby I'm Yours', 'Be My Baby' for starters and leave this for last.  Then you will see her talent at it's best and not be disapointed.<br />Tracy Talley~@	2002-09-12

I do not like to be harsh when it comes to writing, but I have to say, this was below standard (in my opinion). I was a fan of her writing when I was starting out reading romance over 13 years ago and decided to pick up another from her thinking I would enjoy it, but I was surprised.<BR>The writing was repetitious and very predictable. She repeated what the character was thinking and doing over and over, almost like she was trying to fill space? The plot was jumbled and disorganized.<BR>One minute the main character is asking to stay with friends after her mother's death and then the very next moment she has a half-baked idea to become a bounty hunter and rides off into the sunset.<BR>The getting together of the two main characters was seen from a mile away and held no element of surprise to the reader. The premise could've been great, but too many inconsistencies got in the way and I was left many times shaking my head.<BR>If you want a boring romance where the heroine hasn't got much of a brain and the hero is the 'I will save you even thohjgh you are kinda dumb' type of guy, then this is it, but if you're looking for a more intelligent and mature read, look elsewhere. <br />After Holly Winitizer's mother died from mysterious causes, she embarks on a journey to find the truth. Becoming a bounty hunter, she seeks out her prize, Jake Two Moons and goes into Montana only to find his twin brother Winter Raven instead who is also seeking him.<BR>Together they forge a pact to find Jake, for different reasons. They should be enemies, but Raven can't deny the fact that he likes Holly and sees her goodness. Holly cannot believe Jake and Raven are twins, they are like night and day.<BR>Crossing mountains and rivers to find justice and family, they rely on each other and try to find peach and love.<br />Tracy Talley~@	2002-09-12

All those things considered, Catalina Lane is still having a hard time understanding what just happened. Last she'd known she'd been left at the altar and had driven hell for leather down a deserted Arizona highway only to blow a gasket on her precious Mustang and had been forced to walk to the nearest gas station...in heels and her wedding dress...not to mention her running mascara and windblown hair. Only to find that she was somehow thrown back in time...one hundred years!<br />Suddenly a surly but very sexy looking Desperado type looking man rides up on his horse and offers to get her to the nearest town. Was he the infamous Kid Creede she'd read about from 1896? This was too much, even for her!<br />Thinking her a crazywoman, Jackson Cady reluctantly takes her to the nearest town where he is going for a job.<br />Bad goes to worse as she is mistaken for a prostitute promting Jackson to use the rest of his gold to rescue her from a greedy madam at least for a week until she finds her way out of the mess, but he soon learns she isn't that easy to forget.<br />Saddled with a crazy and very naive woman who babbles about the twentieth century and claims her Mustang died but is getting 'fixed' soon, Jackson realizes he is in danger from a murderous enemy who wants him dead and the notieriety that goes with killing Kid Creede. She knows something he doesn't and it sends chills down his spine...is she mad or merely telling the truth?<br />Soon he realizes he doesn't care...all he wants is to be with her and keep her from harm and the evils associated with being by his side.<br />Can one change history? Can her love for him save his soul? Can she make him believe in magic? She sure will try...<br />Very funny and romantic. The timetravel was very believeable. The only thing I would change is the fact that the romance moved too fast for my tastes and enjoyed the humor so much I would've loved it to last to the very end. But alas, there needs to be some drama to balance the scales and Ms Jones does this nicely.

A true rollarcoaster ride.  Few books that I can recall have come close to this one's calliber.  <BR>A change from the ordinary reads, this one tackles an older woman and younger man affair and the heartbreak and tragedy that it brings.<br />Leigh Fallon must justify why she wants to cheat on her husband of 20 years.  Not too hard when she finds out her Congressman husband is less than honest.<BR>Bob Fallon ignores Leigh except to criticize or belittle her.  Leigh is helplessly drawn to the twenty-something Norwegian exhange student Erik staying with them for the year.<BR>After finding proof that Bob is spending all his free time with his young and gorgeous secretary on Capitol Hill, Leigh decides to give in to her urges and begins an affair with Erik.<BR>What she doesn't expect is how her normal and tidy life will change so dramtically in so short a time, setting off a domino effect that will end in tragedy, heartbreak, jealousy, courage and love...<BR>The many emotions displayed in this book will leave you mentally exhausted, but smiling with the triumphant end.

It was literally like watching a James Bond movie, except much better if I do say so myself ;)<BR>This 'James Bond' was none other than mysterious John Medina from Ms Howard's previous title 'Kill and Tell', the CIA agent and computer wizard.    Never knowing what to expect next was all the fun!  It was edge of your seat excitement that I haven't read in a long, long time, expecially of this genre!<BR>Chases scenes that will leave your heart hammering, gunplay that will leave you gasping and the neverending disguises that will make you smirk when the badguys are fooled.

Having loved the first two books, I have to say, this is my favorite!<br />The action is literally nonstop and filled with enough plot twists and tension to keep you up all night or day reading.  The romance sizzled and the locale was so different and unique!<br />This third installment is about the eldest of the Wright children, Michael, ex-Navy SEAL.<br />Michael is bent on distroying the man responsible for murdering his partner and causing him to lose his job in the SEALS.

The suspense was lacking in this one unlike most of her others.  The killer was revealed too soon.  The romance moved way too quickly for my taste and in the end I wasn't real convinced that they knew each other well enough.<br />The killer was frightening and the scenes gory enough to make you wince, but none of the creepiness you usually get in her novels due to the fact that the killer is revealed to us early on and we know how he thinks and how he hunts.<br />I was surprised though that I truly began to believe in Marlie's pychic abilities almost from the start.  Ms Howard makes her writing very believable and she convinced me she was truly able to sense things and feel the murders.  No hocus-pocus here.<br />The detective in the case, Dane, was a little too pushy.  He came on to Marlie so fast and so strong that I was taken back by it.<br />Having read alot of Ms Howard;s work, this one was a bit of a let-down.  The end was disapointing and anti-climatic.  If you never read her work before, DO NOT start with this one(although it is good, just not her best) start with 'Mr. Perfect' or 'All the Queen's Men'.<br />Marlie Keen is a clairvoyant trying to lead a normal and quiet life again when after six years of blessed silence she is seiged with a vision so horrifying that she blacks out.  What does she see?  A vicious murder by a madman...a madman that exudes his energy so powerfully that Marlie is stunned at the violence of it.<br />Was it a dream or was it real?  After seeing the news the next day and seeing her vision come to life, she knows she is going to have to report the vision and be sucked into the life once again...but can she do it? After what happened 6 years ago?<br />Detective Dane Hollister of the Orlando Police Department doesn't believe Marlie's claim of clairvoyance.  She must be involved in the murder to know that much information.  But was she?  After witnessing an episode of a vision, he feels chills race down his spine and immediately checks it out only to find that she was 100% correct...they have a serial killer loose in Orlando and the only link to his capture?

The bad guys are truly bad and make you wince.<br />I have to be honest here though, I don't know what it was, but I think I enjoyed the first one more, even though I LOVED Hide and Seek.  This one was more the male lead going after the female lead, it was the opposite in Kiss and Tell.  In this one, the female lead, Delanie Eastman is the 'loner' and 'the strong one'.<br />After awhile I got tired of her always trying to be in charge and getting into trouble, which in turn causes the lead male, Kyle Wright to get tangled into very dangerous situations.  But all in all, that was my only complaint.<br />Delanie Eastman is posing as the very pampered and spoiled girlfriend of an international crime lord and terrorist.  Forcing herself to not cringe or let her cover be blown, she suffers the rigors of the South American jungle and the crime lord's remote mountain top retreat.  Her mission?  To find her missing sister Lauren.

She must prove to the world of archeology and herself that the Lost City of Stone really does exist and so does the Heart of the Empress, a rare red diamond.<br />She also must prove that a tribe of women warriors existed behind those walls...the mythical Amazon Women of long ago...Not able to finance the trip herself, Jillian Sherwood must enlist the help of her estranged brother Rick Sherwood. Having not spoken in years, he agrees, only because the call of a rare red diamond and treasures will make him a rich man. He in turn finds a very wealthy and scrupulous man bent on taking the riches for himself who is willing to finance the trip.<br />Ben Lewis is surprised to see an American woman with two very greedy looking and dangerous men wanting a guide to bring them into the uncharted recesses of the Amazon for two months, maybe longer. Seeing they will find any guide to get them in, he is intrigued and agrees to the trek, only thinking of the mysterious reasons behind the trip and how the woman surely was in over her head and in a lot of danger.<br />The lure of the City compells them to keep going even though pirates inhabit the rivers, smugglers are everywhere, danger is lurking around every corner and the unknown areas of the jungle maybe their final resting place...that's if the other people on the trip don't pick them off first...<br />Greed, desperation, lust and love abound in this wild story. A very exciting rollercoaster ride into the depths of South America and to the Lost City filled with secrets. Who can you trust is the question as they keep going, getting ever closer to the answer.<br />Two soulmates unite in an explosion of lust, then love. But can they trust one another? Will the lure of 'The Empress', The Heart of Fire, kill their love?<br />Don't miss this one. This is a definate keeper! Ms. Howard always brings us on a unique journey and keeps us guessing and as always, her love scenes sizzle off the pages! Ben is what every woman fantasizes about and Jillian is just your average woman that can carry a pack weighing a hundred pounds deep into the snake infested jungles of Brazil....lol, no whiner here.

My first Cherry Adair book and definately not my last!  Packed with action that I so love in a romance and jampacked with romance and very steamy love scenes that will singe the pages!!!  All I can say is, WOW!  I haven't read a romance this good in a long while.<BR>Too many contemporaries are filled with too much sex and talking.   If you like your romances spiced with plenty of action, bad guys, mysterious men with a secret past, a mountain being hit hard by a unexpected snowstorm, a cabin, and one woman bent on finding out the truth and being caught in the melee, this is just what the doctor ordered...<br /><br />I loved the action scenes and how detailed Ms. Adair is with her military information, etc.  An amazing book that will leave you on the edge of your seat with heart pounding scenes that will have you waiting anxiously for the outcome.  <BR>The second book to this is 'Hide and Seek', the main character is Marnie's youngest brother Kyle...the third book is 'In Too Deep', the main character is Marnie's oldest brother Michael.<br />Tracy Talley~@	2002-08-19

Extremely funny and very fairy-tale-like.<br /> A village named Markesew in medieval England is besieged by a hungry dragon who demands sheep on a daily basis and a sacrificial virgin once a year to stop him from coming ashore and wiping the farmers out.  What can they do but keep picking young women each summer solstice in a 'lottery' to sate the dragon's hunger...until a young virgin sent to the dragon was too tough for the dragon's teeth...her name?  Alizon...<br />Twelve years later, a Dragonslayer arrives unexpectedly to slay the infamous dragon...except he isn't really a dragonslayer and he isn't from Markesew...or medieval England for that matter.  He's just your average run-of-the-mill professional wrestler from the CUW known to his fans as St. George the Dragonslayer...<br />What he stumbles upon can't be just a dream he is having or some weird fantasy of truly being a Dragonslayer...or can it?<br />Who is the mysterious mistress at Devil's Mount?  And why is she denying him access to her fortress?  Doesn't she fear the dragon?<br />Dream or not, George is determined to slay the dragon and save the mistress trapped in the castle...until he realizes the dream is no dream and the mistress is far more tough than the dragon...What is the secret she harbors?  He must find out the truth before he is sent back to the future...and away from his heart...<br />Extremely funny and very sexy.  My first book from Ms. Cach and definately not my last.  Set amid myth and legend and a little fairytale, this story is filled with adventure and romance.  So much that it will keep you flipping the pages until you find out what happens with George and the dragon.<br />I am a HUGE wrestling fan and I was very impressed with Ms. Cach's accuracy and with the way she explained how tough and real professional wrestling is.  It's always dangerous and always exciting, but the men and women who do it on a daily basis for our entertainment, risk life and limb to make us cheer and smile.  George was definately not 'cartoonish' or fake by any means.  Bravo Ms. Cach!!!<br />...George was definately not 'cartoonish' or fake by any means.  Bravo Ms. Cach!!!<br />...	2002-08-15

I was ready for a gritty and dark ride into the case of a murdered young boy from over 20 years ago, his bones found on a deserted hillside by a neighbor's dog.<br />'City of Bones' is Los Angeles.  Nicknamed 'Bones' due to the tarpits that regularly churn up bones from thousands years past.  This time though, the bones they find are merely 20 years past and found on a lonely hillside.  Detective Bosch has been in the force for over 25 years and this is a first.<br />Who is the boy in the old grave?  His bones indicate massive trauma and old wounds healed.  But who were they looking for?  A serial killer that's still prowling the streets after all this time?  Or something much more dark and sinister...<br />What Bosch and his partner Edgar find brings them on a wild ride into the depths of human suffering and shame.  Who would kill the ten year old?  And why?  Why does his bones speak a very terrible and dark past that both Bosch and Edgar feel ill just thinking about?  The more they find the more they dread the final leg of the gruesome journey.<br />We follow the main detective Bosch throughout the book and watch as he struggles with his personal feelings in this painful case and how he develops a relationship with a rookie patrol cop named Julia Brasher half his age.<br />The writing is very good and Bosch's personal life will distract you enough to forget facts so you will be surprised when things pop up throughout the book, but the ending was a big disappointment for me.<br />The tension builds and builds effectively and then I felt let-down at the end.  I was left asking out loud, \\"So...why did he pick this as the climax?\\"  I guess I was expecting something more spectacular and frightening to make me widen my eyes and say, \\"Whoa!\\", but alas, I simply frowned and said, \\"Why did he do that?\\"<br />If you're looking for something realistic with a real-life ending to a murder, look no farther, but if you're like me and when you open a book you want to be swept away and brought on a rollarcoaster ride and to have the murderer or murderers be something really frightening and 'out there', then skip this one.  It's probably something you'd see on the 11 o'clock news....<br />Tracy Talley~@f you're like me and when you open a book you want to be swept away and brought on a rollarcoaster ride and to have the murderer or murderers be something really frightening and 'out there', then skip this one.

After her dogs kept getting sick from the pet food she was feeding Ann Martin, an average pet owner like myself and others went about finding out what was in the food itself to cause such a reaction.<BR>Her search took her from Canada(where she lives) to the US and spaned almost 8 long years.  What she found will shock and horrify you.  The pet food giants are putting unbeliveable things into the food we so diligently buy for our beloved animals thinking its for their good health.  After this, I would rather feed my pets my own garbage to be frank.  Not that I would, but it would be much healthier than what goes into the feed they're eating from the bag.<BR>Diseases and potential toxins are sitting in that bag of food, be it, premium name or generic, they are from the same place and cut, don't be fooled.  After reading this, I will never again subject my furkids to this kind of sick treatment.  These people should be locked up for what they are doing to our pets.<BR>Ms. Martin took on the Canadian Government and the FDA with not much luck.  Apparently the governments don't care what our pets are eating, so its up to us to be warned and take precautions.  I commend Ms. Martin for the excellent job she has done and the thousands of dollars she's spent trying to blow the cover on the pet food giants.<BR>A book WELL worth the money.  One you SHOULD NOT miss if you're a devoted pet owner.  Consumer beware, an excellent book that gives the facts, horrifying as they may be.<br />Tracy Talley~@	2002-07-09

An in-depth and complex thriller that sends chills up your spine.  The characters are very deep and well thought out.  I loved Marty and Dusty and especially Skeet.<br />We start out with a 28-year-old woman named Marty Rhodes.  She has a best friend named Susan Jagger who needs moral support for her Angoraphobia.<br />Susan is afraid of everything.  Including being outside, seeing strangers, working, ect and needs the help of a reknowned pychiatrist.  Just getting there is a dreaded thing she tries to avoid.  But with her best friend's help she has been able to go every week with no fail.<br />But lately Susan feels as if someone is visting her at night and doing unspeakable things to her without her knowledge even though she wakes up with nothing out of place.  How can this be?  Is she going going completely crazy or is someone really visiting her?<br />Suddenly Marty begins to imagine herself doing horrible things to her husband and sees all sharp objects as potentially dangerous and deadly.  Where did this come from?  Why is she suddenly afraid of herself?<br />Dusty is going crazy trying to help his brother Skeet.<br />Skeet's inability to function due to trauma that isn't understood throughout most of the book's complex plot made the reader feel for him.  At times we are led to believe one thing and then another until we are very curious to why Skeet cannot function and then ultimately attempts suicide.<br />Adding to this is his wife's new fear of herself and hurting him or others and her best friend's phobia.  Strangely it becomes a weird pattern and Dusty realizes things aren't as they seem.<br />Someone caused this and he must dig through the haze and fears to find the truth.  When he does, the truth is stranger than fiction and his, Marty's, Susan's and Skeet's lives are in danger.<br />Can Dusty save them before disaster strikes and the cycle is complete?

This is the second book in the 'Outlander' series. Usually the second book in any series doesn't live up to its 'parent', but this one, this one truly is an enchanting sequel and kept me spellbound.<br />The setting is so original and the plot is so unique, I can't seem to get through these books fast enough!<br />Leaving us waiting anxiously after Claire decides to stay in Scotland and in the past, her and Jamie must leave Scotland for fear of his capture. They travel to the political and scandalous courts of Paris where Claire must try and save his life and help Jamie save the country he loves from a king bent on claiming the throne.<br />The love they share is tested many times and in many ways; through pain and torture, Claire can never imagine her life back in the future without the undying love of her Scottish warrior. On the brink of a Jackobite Rebellion, the country is torn and Claire suffers in her heart the knowledge of what is to come.<br />Hearing the fatal call of the doomed battle of Culloden Moor, Claire must convince Jamie not to fight. How do you convince a Highland warrior not to fight for his freedom and life?<br />Bearing too much knowledge and fear, Claire is forced to make a decision that she must live with...<br />Now twenty-years later (1968)after her disapearance in 1945 she suddenly reappears staggering and confused in the same spot she vanished 2 years later.

This is the fifth book on the 'Outlander' series and in my opinion, the absolute worst. I only gave this one three stars(and this is being very generous) it deserves 2 or 1 even, but I took into consideration the time and detailed information Ms. Gabaldon did into this long-winded book(979 pages).<br />So what happened you ask? I was stunned to read and have to connect it to the rest of the exciting series. It was chock full of boring and I mean boring, details of daily life. Not just a few pages here and there, I could deal with that, but like 200 pages in a stretch of boring details on menopause, everyone's 'monthly flow', sickness, medicine, vomit, teething, baby excrement, you name it, it was here...in vivid detail.<br />Not only was that in detail, but we also read about Claire's missing home continuously, Jamie's rise to being in a Laird position in the ridge, Claire and Jamie's daughter Brianna(please Ms. Gabaldon, send her home)and her husband Roger(we could do without also)and their confusing marriage. A mixture of other characters that make no sense in the story and just confuse and bore the reader to death.<br />I was under the impression from reading the previous books and by reading the back jacket of this one that this would go right into the Revolutionary War. What happened? When are we to see the war? Ms. Gabaldon could've cut out about 972 pages of junk and worthless story and skipped ahead a few years to the start of the Revolution.<br />Instead we meet up with a bunch of characters and read about how the Highlander Regiment got started(which is interesting but long-winded to say the least) and how the Crown tried to squelch the revolt.<br />Jamie is called to arms and his men(the area men) name him their commander(not sure why?)and we see how he and his men try to make laws and fight the shaky politics of the time.<br />It is the few years of calm before the storm. The English Crown is losing ground in the Colonies. Jamie is determined to stop the English from taking his new home.<br />Don't expect any fighting or historical intrigue, we spend most of our time in the ridge around Cape Fear, North Carolina and we see how Claire learns how to cope with her doctoring in the 18th century; how Brianna deals with her attack from the last book 'Drums of Autumn' (why is Roger so blase about the whole thing?); Brianna's baby's teething and potty training; the neighbors midlife crisis; a murder mytery that doesn't make sense; Brianna's attacker running around unfettered, ect...<br />Leaving a bland taste in my mouth, I am hesitant about buying the next installment of this saga.

Although I loved this fourth book, I also was a tiny, and I mean tiny, lol, bit disapointed that we didn't get to see much of Claire and Jamie's life in the New World as this one focused mainly on their daughter Brianna.<br />In the last book 'Voyager', Claire and Jamie are cast ashore in the Carolinas with nowhere to go and with no hope of returning to a unstable Scotland. 'Drums of Autumn' picks up right where it left off and we see them safely to the Colony of Cape Fear, North Carolina, where other exiled Jackobite Scot Highlanders settled.<br />Here they make a new life where the rivers run clear and the rolling hills remind them of home and the fertile valleys give them hope. Jamie becomes disheartened when the British Crown threatens everyone's peace and the Americans begin to rile over taxes and control of their new home.<br />Striving to get away from government control, Jamie takes Claire farther into the wilderness and into the mountains; at last finding a precarious foothold. He is convinced that war cannot invade into their mountain sanctuary.<br />History spares no one and Brianna, the daughter Claire and Jamie have left in the future finds a terrifying piece of information from the past that throws a black shadow over her peace of mind.<br />Her mother and a father are in danger.<br />Not wanting to sit back while history completes itself, Brianna follows her mother into the past to change history and finds herself flung into a foreign world that was once her own. But now Brianna finds her own life in danger and must make a decision so heartbreaking that it will tear their fragile family apart.<br />Love, pain, treachery and tragedy bring this story to life. I liked Brianna alot, but was a little bit disapointed that the entire book seemed focused on her travels(which by the way I thought was fascinating)and her life.<br />We get to see Claire again and brave Jamie, but only briefly here and there.<br />Jamie has changed a little in this book, gotten older and matured. He is very sweet, but now is wary of people and overly protective. Jamie is the 'perfect man', if a man can get that perfect, lol.<br />Claire also has matured and shown us how she has changed in little ways.

Four long years of abuse and the night of the funeral she is once again attacked  brutally and then knows for certain it will never end.  Doing the unthinkable, she ends her torture and finds herself on trial.<br />Thinking things can't get worse, they do as she is convicted of murder and is sentenced to prison. Once a weak girl she becomes a strong woman in those years and wants to start her life over and she does.<br />Taking a job in Chicago for a modeling agency Grace is thrown into the seedy world of drugs and backstabbing.

The third in the 'Outlander' series and still kept me riveted.  In this enstallment, Claire is in her own time and its twenty years later from the time she first went back (1945)and she has a daughter from Jamie, Brianna who is 20 years old.<br />Claire is now a succesful doctor living in Boston and still longs for her lost love, a Scottish warrior from the 18th century named Jamie Fraser.  Her twentieth century husband Frank having passed away two years ago, Claire is feeling that heartwrenching pull to return to her love.<br />But how does a mother leave her only child to find a man she once knew and loved almost two hundred years ago?  How does she explain this to the man's daughter who looks just like him?  Just seeing Brianna makes her heart ache for Jamie.<br />With the help of Brianna and a friend who studies genealogy charts, Claire finds out that Jamie somehow survived the bloody Battle of Culloden!  Dare she risk another trip through the stones to find him?<br />With understanding and the love from her daughter, Claire finds the support and courage she needs to take the plunge into the unknown with the knowledge that she may never again be able to return to the future and Brianna.<br />Seeing Jamie again nearly knocks the breath from her.  Their love is still intact, even 20 years later.  Trouble is still in the air, this time they are uprooted from the battlefields of Scotland to the exotic and mysterious West Indies.  Coming face-to-face with an 18th century serial killer, Claire is the only one who can stop the madness.<br />Voodoo magic and political intrigue, Claire and Jamie are thrust on a voyage to the pits of humanity and must use their love and trust in one another to survive.<br />I thought the use of voodoo and the islands in the 1700's was unbelievable!  It was so fascinating and kept you on your toes!  Their journey through the world of magic and greed for life made sense and also explained things to me that I missed in the first novel 'Outlander'.  The stones are more in depthly explained along with the travel of time.  It was so unbelievable that I was engrossed for hours and hours and found it dark outside before I thought to even eat!<br />This is probably one of my favorites so far of the three I've read.  It moved faster and with more excitement that the last (even though I loved 'Dragonfly') and I was sad to see it end, some 1050 pages later, lol.<br />The time spent apart made the heart grow fonder and I was happy to see the passion still well alive between them.  I love Jamie anyway, and fell in love with him in 'Outlander', but in this, I loved him even more and wished I were Claire, lol.

I was so excited to read this book that I started reading it as soon as I got it and then began to frown a little, then more, then realized I was frowning so much because the heroine was not only irritating, but she was flaky and cold.  I got about 100 pages in and was wondering when it was going to pick up finally and the again realized that the book was 377 pages.  It should've been very involved at this point, but all I got was bored and confused.<br />Confused because the jumbled plot was filled with too many people all talking at once and information into their lives when they had nothing to do with the story, or, the 'wedding party'.  What party?  There was no funny and quirky wedding party with crazy characters that will make me laugh until I ache or touching moments where I sigh and shake my head.  Too much insight into the main character Charlene's friend's life, Pam and Charlene's 25 year old daughter Samantha.  Also more looks into the lives of a single mother's life whom Charlene is representing in court, a couple that is divorcing, her ex-husband, her elderly mother,her present boyfriend and future husband Dennis-with whom we're supposed to see in the wedding party as the groom, ha!, Dennis's dead wife, his sister...I can go on.  My point is, is it too confusing.  Too many plot developments that lead nowhere.<br />In short, this story was supposed to be about, and I stress the word 'supposed' because it came nowhere near it; a 45 year old woman who is sucessful at being a family lawyer and is happy with every part of her life, even with the long-term relationship she has with her boyfriend who is a doctor.  The problem comes in when her daughter says she doesn't want to end up like her, single and alone and then her mother seems to be losing her mind when she gets lost in a grocery store parking lot and to top things off her ex still loves her and says she can't commit.  To fix the problem she decides she wants to marry Dennis,(the doctor boyfriend).<br />This is where we're supposed to have the wedding party, but we don't.  The entire book is a mix of her life's setbacks and letdowns and how she hated her father and how he caused her to shrug off relationships.  How her fiance is her 'rock' and her staunchest supporter, but he starts an affair with the wedding cordinater.  She doesn't seem to care either way.  Her spoiled daughter gets way too much time in the book and we were introduced to her boyfriend Grant too late.<br />All in all, we are faced with a flaky 45 year old heroine who is having some sort of mid-life crisis and it definately isn't funny, lol, a spoiled 25 year old daughter who is just as flaky, a quirky ex husband whom we never really understand, a cheating doctor fiance and an elderly mother who keeps upsetting Charlene.  I am still waiting for the 'hysterical wedding fiasco' that I was promised on the jacket back...  save your money on this one....<br />Tracy Talley~@/>This is where we're supposed to have the wedding party, but we don't.

I am slow in reading this series, it being 11 years since its release, but am sucked in like the rest and become addicted to the characters and plot.  Written in first person, it felt like looking through the eyes of the main character, time-traveler and WWII combat nurse Claire Randall.  Ms. Gabaldon makes everything so real and believable that I was starting to think that maybe it would be possible to travel back in time as she did.<br />No elaborate thrills or magic spells to convince us the reader, Claire is propelled from 1945 back to 1743 by way of a circle of stones on one of the British Isles; when she and her husband go on a second honeymoon.  She is attracted by the stones and innocently touches a boulder in amazement at their structure and finds herself laying facedown in the woods with distant screaming and swords clanging.<br />She is now a Sassenach- an \\"Outlander\\" stuck in war torn Scotland.  Almost being captured and completely confused, she is rescued from a man she strangely knows in the future who wants to bring her to London for being a spy, by some rough members of Clan MacKenzie.<br />Riding all night, she sees she is being brought to Castle Leoch, the same castle she and her husband spent their honeymoon in 1945!  But now it looks different.  Old.  Gray.  Devoid of laughter and fun.  It's inhabited by the clan and the clan is readying for war.  She is thrust into lairds, spies and politics of the time.  Claire soon realizes with shock and horror that she is in the past and she is also horrifed that Clan MacKenzie wants her to marry their gallant young Scots warrior Jamie Fraser.<br />Marrying Jamie will save her from the English that want her dead for spying but Claire is so confused and scared, she fights it.  Fate steps in and she finds herself attracted to the young man and madly in love.<br />Torn between fidelity and desires she cannot understand, Claire finds her life and heart also torn between two worlds and two men...<br />The descriptions were so rich and detailed I still can't get the imagery out of my head.  The sacrifices she makes and he makes will have you in tears.  I was also pleased to see that Claire realized she was in love with two men and was confused and heartbroken at the same time.  Too many books out there make it seem so easy and plain where her heart should be, but in this case, it isn't so easy or cut and dry.  Truthfully, I liked Jamie better than her husband Frank and think he is a much better person all around.  But I also feel for her and how she misses Frank.<br />The history was clear and the countryside of Scotland was so beautiful and written with such flair that it made me wish I could be there with her.  Ms. Gabaldon's small details of smallpox shots and herbs made it seem even more real and I applaud her.  Very original and with a heroine that keeps her head above all odds, this is a classic...tions were so rich and detailed I still can't get the imagery out of my head.

I am a huge fan of romance, all categories, but lately I am finding myself bored on more than one occasion with the books out there.  When I picked this one up, being told it was a 'chick lit' book and also being a huge fan of that genre too, I was greatly surprised and thrilled to be reading about an average woman who is 28 and not a size 6!<br />I have nothing against being a 6, but face it, not many of us are and this character, Cannie Shapiro is a size 16.  She has always been a little bothered by what society says about plus size women, but hasn't let it get to her too much until her long time boyfriend Bruce of three years decides to seek revenge for their recent break-up by writing an article called 'Good in Bed'in a popular women's magazine called 'Moxie'.<br />The article relayed events and his thoughts about 'fat women' and how he tried to love Ms. 'C', but couldn't because she didn't love herself enough.  Becoming furious, Cannie knew who 'C' was and went to confront him.  Having nothing to say, Bruce simply says, 'face it, you're fat Cannie'.  Now Cannie has purpose.  She will destroy Bruce!<br />Hilarious at times and touching at others, this story is a realistic look into the life of a single twenty-something facing problems and how she goes from joining a weight clinic to reading yet more articles from her ex, to trying to prove to him how she is beautiful, dealing with her fifty-something mother who has decided to come out of the closet, her absent father,her wacky dog Nifkin and then realizing she needs to like herself for who she is.<br />I was happy at the end when Cannie decided she didn't need to be what society wanted her to be and was happy in her own skin.  A refreshing change in the romance genre, Cannie Shapiro is a real life character and I hope many other authors take Ms. Weiner's lead...<br />I loved it and am excited to buy her new one coming out next spring, 2003, called &quot;In Her Shoes&quot;.  Kudos to Jennifer Weiner on her first book!<br />Tracy Talley~@book!<br />Tracy Talley~@	2002-06-03

It was actaully based on a true story back in the '50's, but Ms. Clark took an author's license with the facts and made a truly creepy and shocking look into a small town murder of a State Trooper's 15 year old daughter Andrea Cavanaugh that happened 23 years ago.<br />In small rural village in New York's Westchester County, Andrea's younger sister Ellie, had been only seven at the time of the murder and had discovered the body in the garage of the town's richest and most prominent family, the Westerfields'.  Three suspects emerged from the fog, Rob Westerfield, a 19-year-old trouble maker and who seemed to be respected by all and was secretly dating Andrea; Paul Stroebel, a 16-year-old schoolmate, who had a crush on Andrea and Will Nebels, a local handyman in his 40's that seemed to have a special thing for young girls.<br />But the one that stood out had been Rob Westerfield.<br />Ellie had revealed to the parents after the murder that Andrea had been secretly meeting him at the garage, she was also blamed in part for her death by her parents since she never told them before and it could've been stopped.<br />In court Ellie's testimony led to the conviction of Rob who she was convinced was the killer.  Even though he spent the next 22 years in prison, he always denied being the killer and became a pillar of the prison's inmates.<br />Rob is about to come up for parole, Ellie, now a dedicated investigative journalist, protests his release and will do anything she can to stop it.  Never-the-less, he is released and returns to Oldham, where he'd been convicted of the murder 22 years before.  Ellie is determined to thwart his attempts at making ammends with society and whitewashing his reputation.  She follows him to her old hometown in Oldham in where she creates a damning website showing his guilt and writing a tell-all book on his shady past.  The deeper she digs, the more she finds about her sister's murder and horrifying facts come to light.  With each new discovery, she is coming close to a desperate killer.<br />Ms. Clark has us thinking one thing, then another and when you think you have it figured out, think again.  Written in first person, we only see what Ellie sees and it makes for a creepy ride into the bowels of a murderer and what they will do to stop her quest for justice.  Bravo Ms. Clark, I was thrilled and amazed with this latest book!  A sure keeper!<br />Tracy Talley~@ing facts come to light.

This is the second book I have tried reading by this author and again I am coming to the same conclusion, bordem. Her writing is very...boring and bland. I hate to be so blunt because writing takes so much time and creativity, but in this case, I feel that no creativity was put into it.<br />This thriller/romance read more like a political-intrigue-drama than any thriller/romance I have EVER read. Way too heavy on the politics for my taste and then she brought in the telekenetic bond between undeveloped characters and I was like, alright, I had enough. I mean, we barely knew the characters and then now we're supposed to buy the whole telekenetic connection thing between them in dreams? I was often catching myself making faces of disbelief and felt bored to tears.<br />The storyline was so monotone that I had to reread pages because I apparently lost interest enough to let my mind wander to things like the laundry sitting in the washer and if my dogs needed to go out instead of what had happened telekenetically between these people. It began happening so much that I gave up midway through and said enough.<br />~Cassie Andreas is the daughter of the President of the United States and has been catatonic since the murder of her nanny and the Secret Service Agents on duty protecting her. All she sees are green eyes looking at her from the darkness. The only person who can free her from her state is reknowned Dr. Jessica Riley.<br />Jessica specializes in kids and people with severe tramatic experiences. But this job is far beyond her experiences.<br />She enlists the help of her sister, another of her patients who also was brought back from the same state years ago. Between Jessica and her sister Melissa they also find the help of a surly man named Michael Travis; the President trusts to help, what they find is disturbing...how is it that Melissa and this man can actually communicate with Cassie when she doesn't speak?<br />Mysterious powers prevail and the answer to the burning question of who-dun-it becomes all too risky and dangerous. Can Cassie save them before the killer strikes again or will it be their demise...<br />Sorry fokes, but no real intrigue here, just alot of unbelieveable 'powers' and some very underdeveloped characters that you will easily forget.<br />Tracy Talley~@burning question of who-dun-it becomes all too risky and dangerous.

I didn't know what to expect, except that she is very popular and a lot of people seem to like her writing very much.  Which brings me to why I was so surprised in this book.  It was very disjointed and I got lost in the numerous plots she has weaving throughout.  I was under the impression it was mainly about a woman named Jane Lewis who is overweight and shy and wishes to be like the homecoming queen and in one fateful night witnesses a brutal attack that leaves the homecoming queen dead and Jane with nightmares to follow her into the future.<br />She strives to become a well respected psycologist and does, even has her own radio show, but things fall apart when one of her patients seems to remind her of the attack that happened 16 years ago.  Who is he?  Should she be worried?  Well, as I found out, she shouldn't be.  I was lost and didn't understand how he got into the storyline and when she tried to explain it later, I was just plain tired of the confusing 'twists' to be interested.<br />The attack and mystery of Connie Bryan's death was very compelling, but the way the author wrote in a romance between Jane and her old college admirer Michael was way too much.  Michael did not fit into the story.  He was like a square peg trying to fit into a round hole.  If you push him hard enough he will squeeze in, but he will still be a square peg trying to fit into a round hole, he doesn't belong here.<br />The romance was really tedious and the most boring part of the confusing tale to say the least.  The fought and bickered a lot throughout about nothing.  Jane was way too touchy and she would flip out on him for no reason and accuse him of calling her things or insinuatiing things about her when all the poor guy was guilty of was trying to have a relationship with a woman who needed her own shrink.<br />Jane was too much for me and I found her distasteful and tacky.  There is also a side story about her mother she hates that comes out of nowhere and goes nowhere fast.  Jane spends her whole life being overweight and unattractive, but we hear nothing more about it later on when she is a psychiatrist.  What happened?  Did she lose the weight?  Is she happy?  Did she work out her problems? We never get enough information to make that decision.  The characters are sketchy at best and I liked the Godparents more than Jane or Michael.  They were quirky and fun and the only thing I looked forward to while reading this.  The 'mystery' was okay and I only finished the book to find out who the attackers were and what happened to them, but it wasn't much of a mystery.  The ghost aspect was weak and I was surprised that the author thought it would be creepy or weird, it was plain funny that Michael was so serious about the ghosts and that Jane neurotic.  The only thing I thought was unique and different in this mix of a mystery/romance was the way the author added pets into the story skillfully.  The pets and the Godparents are the only thing holding this mix together.  You're better off skipping this and trying something else.  It will only confuse and irritate you...Oh by the way, the other reviewer said that she was laughing when the Michael kept calling Jane's hat 'flopsydoodle' and how her husband would die before saying something so stupid and unmasculine, I agree, lol.... Michael was too unreal as a male lead here...<br />Tracy Talley~@comes out of nowhere and goes nowhere fast.

Written in first person, I found myself engrossed in this story about a chief medical examiner that is desperately looking for the killer who has left 5 couples dead by rest stops in the past 5 or so years.  Dr. Kay Scarpetta becomes almost obsessed with finding this skilled and cold-blooded killing machine that leaves no traces nor a clue to his identity.  His victims are all young, teenagers mostly and all good-looking.  He drags them all barefoot into an area of secluded woods and kills them methodically.  Leaving them facedown and seeming to hold each other's hands in death a 'calling card' is placed somewhere on them to signify he had been there.  The Jack of Hearts.<BR>At times creepy, but mostly very intense, the story moves quickly and it's hard to put down.  I have never read anything from a medical examiner's point of view and I thought it was excellent.  Never were any clues revealed too soon or too late for us the reader to not be shocked or anxious.  We felt all the acute frustration she was feeling in trying to dig up clues and evidence when people seemed determined to block her efforts.  I felt almost like I was watching from some hidden camera as she went through the cases and tried to piece together information.  The revelations were shocking and too horrible to imagine.  This killer was cruel and determined to finish what he started, regardless of the FBI and police looking for him.<BR>I also discovered that this character Dr. Kay Scarpetta is also in a few other books by this author (POST MORTEM, CRUEL AND UNUSUAL, BLACK NOTICE, ect)and now I am getting them all, I enjoyed this one so much.  I really felt like I was witnessing a real detailed look into a non-fictional case, this author is extremely talented.<br />Tracy Talley~@	2002-05-03

I am and have been a huge fan of Ms. Lindsey for years and have read everything by her numerous times, but lately her books are lacking.  This one is another lackluster turnout and I wont be buying anything else from her in hardback.  <BR>The story was the third book in a series that began with 'Man of My Dreams', and 'Love Me Forever', this one, didn't even warrant being in the series.  The characters were so dull and tepid that I had a hard time caring anything about them and wished the book was over.  It droned on and on and I never was convinced of the romance between Lincoln and Melissa.  It centered on too much dialog in London's social season and bored me to tears, there was no real interaction between the two and Lincoln seemed weak.  The 'conflict' in the story was also unbelievable and did not help the drowning book in any way.  I would've given this 1 star, but I had to remember that it is a Lindsey and she must've put alot of work into it regardless.  In my opinion, she needs a break from writing because it shows...<br />~Melissa MacFearson sees London as an escape from her overbearing uncles and family, so she sets off from her home in the wilds of Scotland to the social whirl of London's season.  She doesn't expect to fall for the 17th Viscount of Cambury, Lincoln.<br />Lincoln Ross Burnett is no stranger to Scotland, he grew up there until he was sent to live with relatives in London at twelve years old.  To stay in Scotland would surely be his own demise for a nasty and bitter feud was raging around him, marking him as a target of a brutal gang of 'savages' who were going by the name MacGregor.  Now as he falls for the Scots beauty Melissa, he is reminded of his past and he also finds himself back into the feud for Melissa is the niece of those brutal 'savages' and they are once again targeting him.

I was so excited to read this book but was greatly disapointed when I begun, because the romance aspect was left to the background and the political part dominated the story to the point of bordem.  There was way too much information and pages and pages of textbook information on jade and how it is crafted and set into jewelry or ancient swords for the Chinese.  The romance between the main characters Lianne and Kyle was so rushed and didn't make much sense.  I wasn't sure why he was trying to seduce her and why she even fell for him when she was centered on her work?  I feel like I missed out on the plot here.<br />~Kyle Donovan is trying to get to the bottom of the disappearance of cultural treasures from the Tang vaults.  He and his brother are trying out there own business at gem trading and treasure hunting.  This discovery would be a coup, the only thing he didn't expect to get tangled in was an international gem ring that will bring him close to a woman who not only beautiful, but also suspected of theft of the famous Tung vault treasures hundreds of years old.<br />Lianne Blakely is the illegitimate daughter of a powerful Hong Kong trader and his American mistress.  She is being accused of theft.  Not just any ordinary theft, but the theft of ancient treasures.  Millions in jade.  She meets Kyle and he believes her, but she must find the real thief.

I have read alot of Ms. Graham's work, and this is an older one, written orginally in 1983 and the time shows in the way the hero and heroine interact.  The hero was very dominating and nearly abusive towards the heroine and alot older than her also. (he was 40 she is 26)Reflecting the times of romances in the 80's.  By today's standards this book would'nt be well recieved. So in reading it, you have to remember when it was written.<br />The beginning was great and I was quickly pulled into the story when they crashed on the deserted island and then had to fend for themselves but eventually fell for one another.  I started to get pulled back out when they were rescued and the subplots of stolen gold and a bitter divorce along with an unwanted pregnancy began to cloud the mood she had woven earlier on.<br />The hero Kyle Jagger was a little too dominate for my taste and too cold.  He was continuously in a bad mood and flew off the handle for no reason.  He treated the heroine Skye Delaney like a pampered and beautiful pet that was too ignorant or fragile to make her own mistakes or decisions.  She was only a corporate excecutive after all and owned her own company, lol.  She was strong in the beginning, but lost my respect when she submitted to Kyle's dominance and somewhat cruel treatment.  She began acting like an 18 year old school girl who needed a much older man's wise advice and wisdom to make her decisions for her.  In the end I was wishing she would run off with Kyle's brother or son, lol.  But all in all, it was highly entertaining and a great book to sit out on the beach or on your porch with for the afternoon.<br />~Fate stepped in when fashion executive Skye Delaney survived a crash on a deserted island with a surly pilot alone.  Both overly domineering and suductive, Skye lost her inhibitions to him and forgot about the 'real world' waiting for them to be found.  How coulkd she return to a fiance and a life of hard work when she found paradise in this man's arms?  The only problem?  Skye soon realizes who he REALLY is and it makes her heart break.

This is only my second book by this talented author and again I am impressed by her ability to keep me turning the pages furiously.  This story delves into the painful world of divorce after 20 years and how life does indeed go on and how sometimes people are regretful but hate and anger cloud their judgement.  The most touching moment in the book that really got to me was how in the end sometimes you get exactly what you thought you wanted and then find out its nothing like you thought and all you want now is to stop time, but you can't.  Life can be cruel, but its only as bad as you make it.  And sometimes people can't admit their wrongs and can't deal with their mistakes and find other ways of dealing with them...<br />~Margaret Crane is envied by alot of people.  She has a comfortable and nice home with three wonderful children and a loving husband that works too much.  Everything seems perfect...too perfect it seems as she wonders why her husband can't seem to get any time off of work anymore and works so late she barely sees him anymore.  He seems distracted and distant.  As time goes by, her husband Adam seems worried about his job and is on trips all the time, leaving Margaret alone to think...to think alot about the woman she met by accident named Randi, the woman that Adam seemed rattled by seeing after 20 years.  The Other Woman.<br />Margaret ignores the warning signs of her failing marriage and fails to acknowledge it until her daughter sees Adam with Randi at a resteraunt and her entire life falls apart in an instant as he confesses.  But Margaret is willing to give it another try and Adam also tries, but they both soon realize things are never going to be the same...Adam loves Randi.<br />Margaret must learn to live without him and get on with life.  How can she?  How can he forget 20 years of their lives together?<br /> Adam also realizes sometimes, getting what you wished for isn't what it's all cracked up to be.  And its hard to admit to a mistake, making it more difficult is seeing your ex finally getting on with her life without you in it...yet he cannot live like this.  Promises...words spoken so long ago now finally make sense to him.<br />Tracy Talley~@making it more difficult is seeing your ex finally getting on with her life without you in it...yet he cannot live like this.

Her latest, 'Dying to Please' was exceptional.  Packed full of strong characters and great dialog along with a fast-paced storyline had me reading this in 6 hours!  The not-often used story of a very intelligent and strong woman who can not only take care of herself but can also protect herself had me smiling.  She is a woman butler and a bodyguard for a retired Judge!  Loved it!  She doesn't need any man to pick up the shattered pieces of her heart or sanity even when she is faced with a murder charge.  She stays strong throughout the entire story and shows her weaknesses appropriately.  Oh and the hero...Ms. Howard sure delivers on the heroes as always.  :)  He is strong, as strong as the heroine and Alpha male to the max.  These two were explosive and made for each other.  As always Ms. Howard creates a web of suspense and romance that just can't be done by many authors.  And her villains are always creepy and real...in this one, the villain is definately not someone you'd want to run into anytime soon...<br />~Sarah Stevens is not only beautiful and intelligent, but she is the impeccably organized, efficient, professional woman butler/bodyguard for a retired Federal Judge.  She takes her work very seriously.  She loves her job and she adores the Judge.  Thwarting a failed burgarly with her martial art skills, her life is thrust into the limelight for her '15 minutes' of fame.  Not enjoying the spotlight, Sarah is disturbed when she recieves an expensive gift from someone and then suddenly finds herself the prime suspect of the brutal murder of the Judge.<br />Detective Thomas Cahill is impressed with the woman's training when he first meets her at the burgarly but when he is called out to investigate the murder of her employer and she becomes the prime suspect, his instincts are on full alert.  Soon she is eliminated as a suspect and not a moment too soon, for Cahill finds himself fiercely attracted to her.  Now as she is in the clear, he dares to persue it.  Soon the trail grows cold and Cahill finds himself falling for Sarah hard.  His heart shatters when yet another of Sarah's employers is murdered...did she do it after all?  Is she a cold blooded murderer?  How had his instincts get so clouded?<br />In the shadows a killer awaits...waiting for Sarah...waiting anxiously for her to finally be alone, to be his after all this time, for he is 'Dying to Please'...<br />...Now as she is in the clear, he dares to persue it.

This one was great, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was simply because she revealed too much information too soon.  Too many heroes at the end and we all knew 'where the children were', at least I did the entire book.  We also knew who the villain was and I was disapointed that she didn't drag it out until the end.  But the villain was as evil as she could make him and truly was creepy.  I just didn't enjoy it as much when I realized who it was so soon.  Not much suspense in this story, but if you have kids, this will make you leery of EVERYONE around you and send chills down your spine...<br />~Where are the children?  That question is once again being asked to her, the mother of two who was once long ago accused of the macabre killing of her other two children and dumping them into the ocean.  But Nancy Harmon knows, or at least, she doesn't remember killing them.  So now after 7 years it is happening again...and with another set of children she has with a new husband and a new life.  Can she do this again?  Face the accusation and whispers around her?  Why can't she remember that night 7 years ago when they were missing?  Who was doing this?  Why?  Why is the nightmare back?<BR>But it is no nightmare...an unspeakable evil is lurking and the cops must find the children before it happens again...can their mother help or hinder the investigation?  Why can't she just remember that night 7 years ago?  Why was it a blank?  Will her new husband believe her cries of innocence?  Will the past come knocking on her door?  The burning question remains...where ARE the children???<br />Tracy Talley~@	2002-04-22

I am never disapointed when I pick up a Susan Andersen book, they are always filled with funny, heartwarming and some very sexy scenes that will make your face blush.  'All Shook Up' was no exception.  Not as much action as I expected from her other books, but this one had alot of sweeter moments that some of the other lacked a bit.  This is also a classic 'beach book' with the fast-paced dialog and storyline that will keep you turning the pages for more.  And as always, her male leads are gorgeous and she seems to have that knack of getting to the nitty gritty of what women find sexy, he he he....<br />~J.D. Carver his lived his life learning hard lessons on the streets and from people he thought he could trust.  The latest?  An unexpected inheritance from a woman he hadn't spoken to in almost 15 years.  He finds himself going to Star Lake, Washington part out of curiosity and partly remembering the past there that drove him to Seattle so many years ago now.<br />Getting there he learns he is now part owner of the lodge that takes in tourists year-round and is skeptical of the family that owns the other half.

Expecting trouble and ready to deal them a punch, he is side-blinded by a woman named Dru.<br />Dru has no time for anything but her ten-year-old son and trying to finally get rid of her badgirl reputation that has followed her for ten years.  But now, the ultimate badboy wearing form fitting white T-shirts and comfortable jeans and sexy as sin eyes and body has just walked into her life.  He calls himself J.D. and has just inherited the other half of the lodge.  Dru does not need this...this 190 pounds of testosterone walking around her all day, teasing and tormenting her until she thinks she will jump his bones!  To makes matters worse, other than he doesn't trust ANYONE and thinks EVERYONE is out to get him, her son seems to hero-worship him.<br />J.D starts to think that maybe his life has taken a good turn for once and maybe perhaps he can have a stable life...until one of his former life's 'problems' comes rearing its ugly head and he knows bringing Dru and her son into his life was a mistake.  People like him, orphan throwaways with nothing,no one and bad pasts did not diserve a woman like Dru or a life like hers.  He must decide to sever his old ties for good and life a new life with Dru, or to go back to the streets and never see her again, he knows he can't keep both.  The trouble is, can he love again?

It was so heartfelt and sad at times, yet it picked up where it should and I was smiling through tears.<BR>Not really a typical tale here, this one is kinda different.  It is based in the 50's, which is new for me.  About a girl who gets pregnant by the highschool hero and is left to fend for herself and all the consequences that come with it, including a tyrantical father and meek, timid mother who won't speak up for her.  She must go miles and miles from home to find hope and love.  What she gets is far more than she could've dreamed. Actually there are two stories here and they get intertwined.<br />~MaryBeth Robertson is alone and 16 and pregnant.  Her father has kicked her out until she 'takes care of her problem'.

The book was a total of 248 pages of nothing but a dingbat heroine and somewhat boring hero.  I was truly surprised.  The plot should've been excellent.  Instead it dragged and the heroine Lucy and hero Zach seemed to jump on each other the minute they met.  I never got to see where they fell in love or when they even became friends.  The lines are blurred.  Even now I am not convinced they loved each other, more like they settled for one another because Zach was getting older and Lucy was lonely and they needed companionship.<br />The 'funny parts' the reviews talked about I thought were contrived in light of how the story was progressing and didn't help.  Zach was too...I don't know...he got under my skin.  We are supposed to believe this guy was a hottie and a 'bad boy cop' ect, ect, but all I got was he was in some sort of midlife crisis at age 38.  Lucy had other major issues I won't even get into, lol.  I am surprised she made it through life as a teacher, that's all I am going to say, lol.<br />~Lucy Savage is not having a good day or week.  Her cheating, loser of an ex-husband didn't even have the nerve to show up in court for the divorce and the dye job has left her hair green and breaking apart.  To make matters worse?  Someone is trying to kill her.  Now she is contending with a sexy cop named Zach who's eyes smolder when he looks at her but he is looking for her ex Bradley.  Apparently Bradley is not only a cheater, but an embezzler too.  How will she finally get rid of Bradley???<br />Zach will protect her round the clock until they catch whoever is trying to kill her by blowing up her car, her bed and breaking into her house.  But who is worse?  Bradley the cheater-embezzler-ex, the guy trying to kill her, or Zach-the-sexy-cop? And how in the world is she going to fix this hair!<br />Really dissapointed. Was hoping for a funny romp, but was left frowning and wishing I had picked up another book.  Try her other books, they are much better in my opinion...

Part of this I guess is my fault, I picked this book up thinking, ok, its a love story between a Navy SEAL and a SEAL widow and some political intrigue.  That was the case, but it also says on the spine (which I did not notice) that is labeled as a 'Inspirational Romance', which means, it is a Contemporary Christian Romance.  Not my cup of tea...I don't mean that in any bad way or anything, so don't get me wrong, but I like to keep my religion and my romance reading seperate.  The way the male lead of a gorgeous Navy SEAL Joe didn't go over with me as going to church every Sunday and the female lead Kelly reading the Bible in bed every night.  Not to say the book was bad or not well written.  I thought it could've been an interesting plot considering all the work the author put into the research on SEALS and the Navy.  The plot fell flat simply because it focused too much on Kelly's insecurities and her incapability to be alone.<br />I understand she was lonely and loved her husband who died, but the plot was clouded by it so much that I was irritated.  Joe was a well thought out character and was wasted in this story in my opinion.  The 'villian' was not believeable to me and I actually liked him, lol.  You're not supposed to like the villian, but here we can't help but like him.  Didn't leave much for me to anticipate.  All in all, the constant whining and clinginess of the heroine bugged me to no end and Joe deserved better.  The 'bad guy' was too nice.  Too much religious overtones.  Not enough romance.  I gave 3 stars for the in depth look into SEALs lives and work and was astonished.  The research was excellent and I applaud Ms. Henderson.  Well done...<br />~Lifeguard Kelly Jacobs was about to drown in the cold waters off the coast clinging to a drowning boy.  How were the Coast Guard going to see her?  It was dark and a storm was coming in fast.  Riptides were all around her.  Time was running out...until she remembered Nay SEAL Joe Baker.  Her best friend now after her Navy SEAL husband's untimely death 3 years past.  He would come find her, he had to.  She trusted him, she needed him, if only she could last for a little longer...<br />Navy SEAL Lt. Joe \\"Bear\\" Baker saved Kelly from the freezing and raging tide in the nick of time.  He wasn't going to let her die, not Kelly.  He had lost his best friend 3 years before and he would not let his widow...the woman he found himself in love with die that night.  He knew Kelly would not feel the same, she had already paid the ultimate price of being a SEAL wife.  He didn't want to hurt her anymore than she was.  But when he saw her hope and spirit sinking lower and lower as time passed, he knew he had to save her, not just from the water, but from dispair.  Love...love will save her and him.<br />The only problem...the very man who killed Kelly's husband is back and so close she can touch him.  They're both about to find that trust and love in God and country will be their only hope.<br />I feel I must make it clear to anyone looking into buying this book that if you are looking for a sweet and very chaste romance with no real violence or offending dialog, this is it.  It is a very 'PG' rated romance; it is also the first book in a series called 'Uncommon Heroes'...ow after her Navy SEAL husband's untimely death 3 years past.  He would come find her, he had to.

It has the common used plot of a geek turned bad boy with his best friend a woman who makes him over and realizes she is in love with him, but I loved it.  I read this book in a day.  It is very fast-paced and full of real witty dialog that had me going til the end.  I would've given the book 5 stars, but my complaint?  Well, the female lead of Tracie (same name as me, so I thought this alone was cool, lol) was somewhat rude at times to the male lead of Jonathan, or Jon.  She was his best friend and only friend and depended on him for support and his genuine friendship, but she kinda took him for granted in so many ways that I found myself cringing at times.<br />She continually pointed out to his face how inadaquate he was and how stupid he dressed and looked.  She kept telling him how corny and boring he was and how he needed to get a life.  I felt bad for Jon and wished he would've said to her that she was a lousy friend.  But enough of the complaints, the book was fun beyond words and had me laughing and in the end biting my nails to find out what would happen(even though I already knew the typical plot).<br />~Tracie Higgins is a writer and journalist and works for a sucessful newspaper in Seattle.  She has a cool boyfriend that plays in a band and is a typical 'bad boy'.  But she also has a best friend named Jonathan who is a guy and is definately NOT a bad boy.  Her problem?  He wants HER to make over HIM from geek to heartthrob!  Can she do it?  All bets are on and what Tracie dicovers makes her heart beat faster...<br />Jon, is quiet and a good friend and son.  Son to about 8 ex-stepmoms to be exact and friend to one.  But Jon hasn't followed in his 'bad boy' father's footsteps.  He works for Micro/Con, a company a lot like Microsoft.  He has stocks and makes great money but works hellish hours.  He looks forward to his nightly get togethers with his very best friend Tracie at the local diner on Sunday nights.  He loves Tracie very much, but Tracie doesn't quite realize just how much he loves her...  He finds himself fed up with his life at 28 years old and wants a change.  Who to do this right?  Tracie of course.  She is notorious for dating 'bad boys' and knows what women crave.<br />After convincing Tracie on bended knee and some begging, she has commited herself to making him a classic bad boy.  But when she succeeds and half of Seattle's women are after him, Jon has no time for her.  Tracie also sees what has been in front of her face all these years and it makes her stomach flip-flop.  Tracie will have to take some inventory on her life and decide what she wants and what she wants is Jon...<br />Worth the money, great book for the beach or a warm afternoon.

This is my first Sandra Brown book and I was pleased.  \\"Envy\\" was so different and original.  A story within a story.  A twisted tale of revenge and anger and plain deceit.  I truly enjoyed the plots twists (and there were many) and the overall plotting of an angry man who needs closure to a long ago crime.<br />~A New York book editor named Maris Matherly-Reed has stumbled across a brilliantly written manuscript called 'Envy'.  Only partially written and the only identity to the author is the initials P.M.E., with the return address of a remote island off the coast of Georgia.  Maris makes it her duty to find him.<br />Her trip to the island takes her on a weird and eerie journey through a ruined and rundown plantation house where the mysterious author resides.  The author, now revealing himself as Parker Evans, is confined to a wheelchair and is very bitter.  he doesn't want her there and now has refused to show her anymore of the book.  Through arguments and deals, Parker finally is coaxed to reveal a chapter at a time to Maris.  What Maris finds is disturbing.<br />'Envy', a story about two friends who rent a boat with a young woman for a night of wild sex and drinking and only one person will return from that trip bloodied and hysterical.  Disturbed, yet intrigued, Maris begs for more and also unwittingly finds herself attracted to the weird author.  Worried about her failing marriage, she reluctantly returns home to husband Noah Reed, co-publisher and recieves more of 'Envy' in the mail from Parker.  What she realizes slowly is that this harrowing tale is not fiction...but a real life account of a long ago crime in which Maris is being used for revenge.<br />How well does she really know her husband?  Who is he...really?  Who is Parker Evans?  How does 'Envy' tie in to all of this and how did she get involved?  Searching for the truth is more dangerous than she imagined and truth is far stranger than fiction...<br />Very intense and full of twists that will keep you guessing until the end!

I have to be honest here to those other reviewers who attacked this book.  I too was a little bothered by the fact that Jemima Jones(our heroine) lost 100 pounds in 3 months and she claims to feel great!  Not realistic in my opinion since it took me 4 months to lose 45 pounds and that was hard as it was excercising hard and cutting way way back on my eating.  Another little peeve that bugged me was her life before she dropped the weight.  I have been overweight all my life and I have never had this many problems in school or with guys.  People giving her dirty looks for being overweight?  Her roomates and people on the street acting disgusted with her?  (I don't think the author was EVER overweight and didn't understand the facts and went with the misconceptions people seem to have about overweight people) She wasn't even THAT large as she claims to be.  She starts out at 214 abouts and claims to be so huge she can hardly breathe or move.  I found that a little ridiculous, but oh well, it's just a book right?<br />~Jemima Jones is overweight, about 100 pounds over.  She is miserable and lonely and is tired of seeing her thin roomates go out every night to parties with men.  She wants some of that life.  Her only friend is a woman at work named Geraldine whom everyone at work envies and thinks is a snob.  She befriends Jemima and Jemima sees in her what she wants to be.  Add to this dilemma, a gorgeous man at work named Ben who also befriends her and hangs on her every word, but doesn't SEE her for a woman, just a great friend.  She knows she needs to change her life when she discovers the internet and a Californian hunk named Brad.<br />Brad is perfect in every way.  He is tanned, gorgeous and fit.  He also thinks Jemima is too.  When things get more serious between them, he asks her to come out to visit him.  Jemima is aghast!  Suddenly inspiration hits...lose the weight, become what you said you were...go out to LA and meet gorgeous hunk!  So now Jemima, now JJ, does just that.  She becomes gym obsessed, food obsessed and thin obsessed.  In three months she is 120 pounds of lean muscle and ready to knock 'em dead.<br />Things get complicated when JJ goes out to LA and finds her hunk.  He is gorgeous...but is this what she wants?  Is thin everything?  Men now flock to be around her and she still feels like the heavy girl in the crowd.  As time passes, she realizes many things about herself.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and life is what you make of it.  She also realizes love is in the most unexpected place of all...<br />It was a fun read and fast-paced.  Jemima could've been much more fun had she stopped her whining earlier on in the book and tried to get a life when she was heavier.  I didn't get why being heavy was stopping her from going out to the mall or stores?  She felt too sorry for herself and it wore thin.  Brad got on my nerves because the author kept saying how 'gorgeous' and 'perfect' he was the whole time and I was starting to think he wasn't even there in LA, that JJ made it all up, lol.  I loved Ben though and I disagree with the other people who said he wasn't interested in her until she lost the weight.  He was interested in her long before, but men being men he didn't make any moves.  He didn't want to ruin the friendship obviously and repected JJ too much to do anything.  I was happy with the ending and also thought the comment about being a size 10 as not being thin was a little stupid, but hey, its just a story and I enjoyed it immensely.oes just that.

Very entertaining tale of a mistaken identity of a twin and the bounty hunter after her.  A fun ride that takes us through Washington State to Wyoming and into the Colorado wilderness without skipping a beat of the action.  I truly liked Sam McKade, the male lead and bounty hunter.  The female lead of the mistaken twin Catherine MacPherson was fun to read, but she sometimes got on my nerves.  LOL...what I mean by that is that she is mistaken for her showgirl-stripper-wild twin sister Kaylee and she tended to try and act like her sister to the point of annoyance.  Hard to explain, but she was being hauled from home and practically accosted by this guy she didn't know and all she did for the first few chapters was figure, hell, I might as well try and be Kaylee and see why she does the things she does.  She wears her stripper clothes and makeup and I got the impression she looked like a hooker to the people in the story, lol.  No offense Ms. Anderson, I loved the story, it was fast-paced and fun to read, but Catherine was a little too unbelieveable in the beginning.<br />~The last thing a proper Seattle teacher for the deaf needs is a surly bounty hunter breaking into her quiet home and mistaking her for her wild and out of control twin sister Kaylee!  She hasn't even seen her sister in a long while!  So when Kaylee shows up at her door wanting help and then suddenly flees leaving Catherine literally holding the bag, Sam McKade comes barging into her home and handcuffs her!  No way is he believing that she is a twin!  things dont get better when he drags her along with all Kaylee's clothes and puts her on a Greyhound bus handcuffed to his wrist intending to go to Miami!  Things get even worse when she is crammed up next to him, all muscle and machoness, making her think bad things about him when she is a respectable schoolteacher from Seattle, not some floozy stripper!<br />Sam McKade has no patience for the lies this irritating, yet gorgeous woman he spewing!  Twins???  Yeah right!  Did she think he was a moron?  He needs this bounty to fulfill a promise to a friend and he is not letting some floozy stripper get the best of him, even though she makes his blood boil...and skin hot...he won't let her!  He can't let her, it will make him careless and he truly needed this money!  Problems begin to mount as someone is on their tail and that someone wants Kaylee dead.  Sam can't believe his luck!  Through tons of tricks she pulls to get away and this 'someone' trying to get her, am is at the end of his rope!  To make things really bad is when Sam starts to realize that Kaylee is not what she appears to be afterall...is she really a twin?  He has no time to ponder this as the fireworks begin to take hold between them and they are running for their lives!<br />Funny moments that will have you laughing out loud and sweet ones that will make you smile.  I loved it and enjoyed the tricks she pulled on Sam.  Very sexy read full of laughs.  Susan Anderson always delivers!!!<br />Tracy Talley~@??  Yeah right!  Did she think he was a moron?

This has got to be one of the most touching stories I have ever read.  A story about a mother who tries to get close to her daughter she hasn't seen in 10 years and the pain that ensues.  A tide of emotions and trials that left me crying at the end.  A true life look into a real family's heartbreak.  I would've given this wonderful story 5 stars, but I thought the parts with Dean (the long lost boyfriend from yesteryear who shows up again to find Ruby)(Ruby is the daughter, 27 now) were unneccesary to the plot.  He just shows up after 10 years and we the reader are supposed to accept him.  I didn't like his character and thought he was weak and had no place in this tale.<br />~Nora Bridge walked out on her family 10 years ago.  She left behind two daughters and a distraught husband at Summer Island, Washington.  She is now a sucessful talkshow host on the radio and has a nationally syndicated newspaper column famous for honest advice and straightforward opinion.  Nora's problem is that a tabloid has gathered long ago pictures of her with a man while she was married and a scandal is about to erupt.  An accident leaves her unable to care for herself and she calls her eldest daughter who still keeps in touch.  She in turns calls the youngest Ruby to help since she has her own family an cannot do it.  The problem?  Ruby HATES her.  Ruby has spent the last ten years hating and dispising her mother for leaving.<br />But a deal from a magazine pays her handsomely to write a tell-all book on Nora and Ruby accepts.  That means she will have to take up residence with Nora at Summer Island.  The place of her childhood...the place where everything fell apart.<br />Nora has 1 week to reconcile with Ruby and Ruby does not make it easy.  But as time passes and their fights erupt, Ruby sees her mother for the first time.  Truly sees her.  What she sees is heartbreaking...Ruby is stunned.  In turn Nora truly sees her daughter and desperately wants to have her in her life.  She needs Ruby as much as Ruby needs her.  They are lost souls trying to reconnect.  Sometimes the truth is harder to accept than what you've devised it to be, but in the end, its what brings us together again.<br />How can Ruby write this now?  Now when she had found her mother after all these years?  A long lost love from years past comes calling again and she must make a decision...forgive and forget or live in anger...<br />Truly a tearjerker.  Well worth the money...made me happy that I am so close with my own mother...Ruby as much as Ruby needs her.  They are lost souls trying to reconnect.

It was good and kept my interest throughout, but I did think it drifted off topic near the middle somewhere.  I also have to agree with the other reviewers about Molly being stuck in a 'fantasy world' and in need of some kind of shrink, lol.  She had some issues that needed tending, and her love, or as I thought, her obession with Kevin wasn't going to fix it.<br />His character was alright, but he also had issues that weren't really explained or dealt with and I felt as if I never really understood them or why they ended up together.  I was convinced she fell in love with him but not he with her.  There was too much conflict that had nothing to do with them near the middle that when the romance started to develop I had a hard time following.  There was a lot of humor that I love in romances and witty dialog that I enjoy, but the plot was sort of weak for my tastes.<br />~Molly Somerville has a reputation for trouble.  She gave away her fifteen million dollar inheritance on a whim and went to living from pay check to pay check writing children's stories.  She is happy though, content...except when her long term crush on Dallas Stars quarterback Kevin Tucker comes breezing back in town like a tornado.  The man can't even remember her name and she finds herself still panting after him...pitiful, but true she decides.<br />Not long afterwards they are forced to get to know each other and being her reckless self, she does something very very stupid that alters her life and his forever...after the storm abades, they go their separate ways.  Each wondering about the other and wondering what if?<br />Kevin doesn't need anymore problems in his confusing life, but when his bosses sister stirs up a major pot of trouble for him, he thinks his life is over.  Soon heartbreak follows, leaving him free to live again, but he can't stop thinking about her.  What if things turned out the way they had been going until then?  On a whim, he kidnaps her and takes her to his childhood camp that his family passed to him, full of memories he'd rather forget than relive.  Hoping just to cheer her up after everything that happened, he finds himself needing her.<br />Sometimes love hurts and sometimes it saves, in this case it does both when an aging sexpot actress shows up with a surprise that Kevin cannot deal with and he finds himself falling in love with the essentric Molly.  Can he forget his past and accept Molly's love?  Can he truly love someone?  Can Molly's fear of not being perfect ruin their chances at happiness?<br />There are parts that will make you laugh out loud and some that will make you somber.  A perfect mix.  I found out that this is a series and Molly's sister Pheobe is the main character in another book called \\"It Had to be You\\" which I NEED to pick up!  I loved her character even more than Molly's and I am dying to read her story.<br />Tracy Talley~@dnaps her and takes her to his childhood camp that his family passed to him, full of memories he'd rather forget than relive.

This is the first book I have read by this author and was not very impressed.  I am sure her others are better or maybe I missed something here, whatever the happenings, it lacked sizzle and suspense.  Being a suspense/romance it made for a somewhat dull read.  The female lead of Laura Frye was a little too whiny and I felt as though she thought people 'owed' her.  The missing husband Jeff was weak and we never got to know him very well.  I thought she brought in the long lost 'wild' brother Christian a little too late to be interesting.<br />~A seemingly perfect 20 year marriage falls apart when Laura's devoted husband Jeff mysteriously disapears without a trace.  He has left behind two kids and alot of questions.  As the days go by Laura finds her 'perfect' life was not perfect by any means.  What had Jeff been doing all those years behind her back?  Was he really missing?  Or did he take off?  The pieces begin to come together as information arises from his dirty dealings and Laura's life slowly erodes.  She is left with a shocking image of her 'true' husband's persona.<BR>Looking for a way to cope and get her life back, she turns to Jeff's elusive brother Christian Frye.  A wild and free spirit.  He shows her love and life again.  What she thought she had lost so many years ago, she finds once again, but will the past secrets come to tear them apart?  Are her friends, truly her friends?  Should she be looking more closely?<br />What started out as a promising mystery, turned out to be a dull look into a jilted woman's life falling apart and her immediate yearning for her husband's brother.  It would've been much better had Jeff been in the story longer and there was less of Laura's whining and self-pity.  In short, I expected more.  It started out great and sort of fizzled as it went on.  In my opinion, the side romance between her best friend and the cop was much more interesting.<br />Tracy Talley~@	2002-03-21

I haven't read a Graham book in a long time and I thought I would try out one of her contemporaries and boy was I shocked!  I had only read her historicals all these years.  This was excellent!  The characters were so real and complex, I loved them!  Especially the male lead of David Delgado.  Whew, does he burn up the pages!!!<br />~Spencer Huntington just lost her husband, a police detective, to a brutal murder and now she is faced with the possibilty that the crime wasn't random at all.  She needs help and only the trusted help of her husband's best friend and her former lover and ex-cop David Delgado.  But, can she do it?  She has to.  She has to swallow her pride and put the past aside and get to the bottom of this heinous act.<br />David is from the wrong side of the tracks, being a former Cuban refugee as a child and struggling through life with nothing until his best friend Danny Huntington saved him.  Danny made his friends David's too and they both fell in love with the same girl, a petite blonde rich girl named Spencer Montgomery.  Ten years later, David is faced with his friend's murder and his widow, the only woman David ever loved.<BR>...<BR>Can their long lost love hinder their efforts for the truth or spur them on to the end?  A killer awaits...<br />Gritty and very well written.  As I would expect from Ms. Graham.  David is very real and deep.  Spencer is no 'rich girl' to be put on a shelf.  These two make a real 'slow burn' on the pages and you will wish for more!  The only complaint is that the killer is a little farfetched, but all in all, the story make up for it by far!  Definate hot romance to read on a hot summer night even though I read it in March, lol.<br />Tracy Talley~@	2002-03-15

The collaboration of four steamy tales written by (in order) Anne Avery- \\"A Dance on the Edge\\", Phoebe Conn- \\"Toss the Bouquet\\", Sandra Hill- \\"Heart Craving\\" and last but not least Dara Joy- \\"My One\\" was more of a batting average of 4 1/2 stars, mainly because of the first two mediocre tales that left nothing behind in their wake but the last two more than made up for the loss and left you gasping!<br />I cannot say what Ms. Avery's other stories are like, but this one she contributed to this anthology was in my opinion....awful. A quick tale about two people set to work on a project miles apart and unable to see one another they converse via email. I am not sure where the title 'the dance on the edge' comes in here because it was so flimsy and 'safe'. In that I mean that the author seemed to be afraid to say certain things a certain way and the characters were boring. The female lead of Marlis was too touchy and offended without provication. In turn the male lead Jack had way too many issues and it clouded the tale she was trying to create. The entire story was told through weird emails and without any real knowledge of the people involved writing the emails. Very tedious and slow. In short, it was about two people with major major issues that couldn't function with most people and found love in each other through emails. Very 'safe' story with no action or excitement.<br />Ms. Conn's tale also lacked any real fire. A woman also with issues that grated on one's nerves quickly. \\"Toss the Bouquet\\" would've been better had their been an urge to toss it? I was lost on why Regan loved her boyfriend to begin with and even wanted to marry him. He was cheap and obvious in his not loving her. She had the nerve to act shocked when he dumped her at the altar? Then she takes in this Italian cyclist and has this wild fling with him in the aftermath to soothe her wounds. I just couldn't care enough about the characters to think anymore on them when it was done, I was too worried about it not ending soon enough. Slow paced at times and tedious, then too fast and confused.<br />Now we come to the best of the tales by a long long shot...Ms. Hill's tale \\"Heart Craving\\" was so heart felt and real that I have been thinking about it since I finished it. I didn't want it to end and it being the longest story in the book I was still irritated when it was over. After two lackluster stories, I was eating this one up like candy! Ms. Hill is my favorite author and this was the reason for my buying the book and boy was I impressed yet AGAIN! A tale about a man named Nick who loves his wife Paula so much he is willing to do anything and I mean ANYTHING to win her back...the problem? He has 7 days. 7 days before their divorce goes through. Can he do it? He will sure try! Even if it means reading all the sex books he can, creating a imaginary oasis on the Jersey shore with camels and belly dancers and meeting with a chain smoking fortune teller to do it! Paula has her work cut out for her! She must resist her wily husband's charm and wit or fall once again in love with him...even if it means giving up the one thing she left him for...her 'heart's craving'.... Two thumbs up! Very funny at times and extremely sexy and sweet. Nick is the perfect man...<br />Ms. Joy once again impresses me with yet another tale of alien meets earthling and fall in love. Only Ms. Joy can pull this off and make it believeable. \\"My One\\" finds a man named Trystan who hears the 'call' of his mate and his only 'One' from another galaxy. Lois is having the worst year. Her boyfriend stole her money and nearly bankrupted her, now she is praying to the gods or whoever will listen to send her a life and namely a normal guy. She gets what she asks for in a 6'4 man rippling muscle and perfect features that claims to be her soulmate, or his \\"One\\". Through time and space the two fall in love and show one another that love can bloom in the oddest places...the twist here? We find out that these two are old souls...destined to find one another. Not revealing too much here, the twist is excellent. Very good tale and did not want to see it end. Touching and sweet and very believeable.<br />I gave this book 5 stars because the last two more than made up for a bad start and I wholeheartedly enjoyed them enough to look past \\"A Dance on the Edge\\" and \\"Toss the Bouquet\\" as merely a small and insignificant addition to the otherwise excellent book.<br />...e two are old souls...destined to find one another.

The male lead of Dallas/Grey was HOT HOT HOT but the female lead of Tess was WEAK WEAK WEAK.  Dallas didn't deserve such a whiny heroine such as Tess, but Grey did.<br />~Tess Marsh finds herself stranded and alone on a dark and deserted highway in Montana.  Along comes a biker willing to give her a ride to the nearest town.  She is about to go since he seems very honest and his eyes are a telltale sign.  The only thing that goes wrong?  When a band og bikers comes riding over the horizon.  Motorcycles blazing and all in a surly mood.  Quickly her savior becomes her captor as he grabs her and forces her to go with them all as his captive.  What happened?  Things get worse when she realizes he is taking her to a biker gang's hideout and plans on ditching her car in a lake!<br />Dallas does not need another hassel, yet the good guy he is, he stops to offer his help to a woman from out of state, Massachusetts to be exact.  Things go from sour to rotten when the gang shows up unexpected and he must play the captor to the woman, all for show.  He cannot mess this up.  He has been working on this for too many years, this woman is going to be a problem he does not need.  Only when he starts to feel his heart engaging does he feel scared.  How in the world is he going to pull this off?  How is he going to keep her safe and juggle this gang in the process?<br />Very sexy and fast paced.  I loved Dallas, yet I wasn't crazy about Tess, she tended to be whiny and unreasonable.  I gave this story 5 stars because I loved the tale, but wished for a different heroine.  She was weak willed and clingy.  I was surprised Dallas could listen to the nagging and whining for so long without getting angry!  They weren't really meant for one another, but the story was excellent regardless.  I just wish the biker part (the beginning) was longer, because that was the best part of the book.  The second part was less exciting and Tess seemed to get worse, lol.  All in all, great job Ms. Bach, I look forward to another book!<br />Tracy Talley~@worse, lol.

Four short stories jampacked into one great collection that deserves two thumbs up!!!  Full of humor and love and plenty of plain Christmas magic that only Elvis can bring?<br />First story was probably my favorite, weird cause I got the book for Sandra Hill's tale, but in the end I liked the first one wriiten by Amy Elizabeth Saunders best.  It's called \\"Can't Help Falling in Love\\".  A sweet, yet classic tale of 'Scrooge' via Memphis style......Charles, a stuffy and rich Conneticutite stranded in the St. Louis airport finds help in a generous waitress intent on helping him get to Memphis by Christmas.  The only problem?  She is driving in a beat-up old Voltz Beetle and seems to have a soft spot for stranded people and Elvis.  Charles soon learns he will have to swallow his stuffy pride and learn to enjoy the holidays instead of dread and make fun of them.  With five people stuffed in the Beetle all the way to Memphis, Charles doesn't think things can get much worse until he finds himself having to stay at the Original Heartbreak Hotel.  A place well-known for its rooms named for Elvis songs and movies, but he must stay on track and finish his purpose for being there...even if it means using the waitress named Bailey, the very woman he finds himself falling in love with.  Can he do it?  Will he risk his only known happiness for it?  Elvis will help him see the way...and Charles won't be able to 'help falling in love'... 5 stars<br />'Always on My Mind' by Linda Jones is more of a 4 star read, but still entertaining.  A story about lost love found and the magic of Christmas to help it along the way...Laura has been carrying around a secret for 5 years that she must reveal at last, but with what cost?  An affair that hadn't worked between her and an out of work musician named Michael had produced a little girl.  That little girl wanted to know her father for Christmas and by God, Laura would give it to her, no matter how hard it would be for her.  Seeing him again, sitting at the grand piano, in a classy club wasn't what she expected.  Although the flame was still there, especially when he looked her way and bolted out of the seat to run after her when she ran.  Laura needs to keep her heart intact long enough to tell him about his daughter, and Michael needs to keep his head intact so he can reveal his own secret.  With a touch of Elvis's help and the Christmas spirit, the long lost lovers find each other via the Original Heartbreak Hotel once again...but will it last this time?<br />\\"All Shook Up\\" by Sharon Pisacreta was the third tale and I gave it a 5 star rating.  A word of help here, the second story is connected to this one, so keep your eyes out. ~ Kim was not having a good day or year for that matter.  She flew all the way to Memphis to try and talk to the biggest record businessman in the country on Christmas to save her floundering PR business.  Landing this account would save it from ruin.  The trick is to get Spencer Modine to see her before she passes out, has a panic attack or falls down from exhaustion!  Spencer finds her charming and can't help but have her convince him why she was the woman for the job...besides passing out on him the first day, but besides that, he likes her, he really likes her and wants to give her a chance.  Can she do it?  Can he concentrate on the job at hand and not her innocent eyes and soul?  With a little help from Elvis and the Heartbreak Hotel, Spencer learns miracles are there, they just happen on Christmas!<br />Last, but not least, \\"Fever\\" by Sandra Hill was a 5 star read of course, lol.  A grinch and giver, this story tugs at the heartstrings. ~ Clay has just learned he has inherited the Original Heartbreak Hotel from his dead father.  He sees it and is stunned.  How could an upstanding man like his father own such a monstrocity?  Clay knows how to fix this, he will have it torn down and built into something grand, along with the lot nextdoor.  The only thing he doesn't expect is to find a group of orphans dressed as 1960 Elvis Style Joseph, Mary and baby Jesus acting out the nativity scene for tips.  Clay hates Christmas...but after a slip and fall, courtesy of the Mother Mary and donkeys, he vows to sue them for all they have until he comes eye to eye with Mary, or Annie to be exact.  A poor farmer trying to save her farm and her siblings.  Can Clay thaw his icy heart?  Will Elvis's spirit save him before he freezes completely?  Will a deep secret hidden for 30 years sway him?  Funny and sweet, all Sandra trademarks!!!<br />Very entertaining book!!!  Well worth the money!  Elvis will put a smile on your face to be sure and you'll wonder if he does indeed still live...even if its only in the hearts of the believers...  ;)<br />Tracy Talley~@s to find a group of orphans dressed as 1960 Elvis Style Joseph, Mary and baby Jesus acting out the nativity scene for tips.

I LOVE Sandra Hill, so this was the reason I wanted this book and boy was I surprised!  It was written 'round-robin' style.  Each author takes a chapter and writes her own characters and intertwines the story.  There are 15 chapters of pure fun here that will make you laugh out loud and wish you were right there on that bus with them!<br />The story consists of Sandra Hill's characters, a Navy Blue Angels Pilot named Sam Merrick who is stranded in Philly at the airport trying to find a way to Snowdon, Maine for his old friend and mentor's wedding.  The problem with this is that a huge snowstorm has forzen the roads and all transportation!  The only way there?  A Santa Brigade bus full of cherry and escentric seniors on their way back to Snowdon and his old flame, Reba Anderson, the senior's director who wants nothing to do with the gorgeous Tom Cruise wannabe!  She still remembers him dumping her 14 years ago!  Sparks are again ignited as these two find each other again, but will love be enough to keep the flame alive?<br />In comes Sam's best friend, also on his way to Maine and also stranded at a train station in Allentown, PA.  Trish Jensen's characters Kevin Wilder, a bounty hunter for the NYPD, runs literally right into his quarry, a woman named Callie Brandt, a woman wanted by the law for running out on her court date.  But she isn't what she seems.  Kevin, now trying to find a way out of Allentown, hops on the Santa Brigade with Sam's help and Callie cuffed to his wrist.  Sparks soon fly when Kevin realizes that Callie is no criminal but her body should be outlawed!<br />Last, but not least is Kate Holmes's characters, an ex-football quarterback for the SanDiego Typoons named Stan Kijewski who finds himself stuck in a snowbank in the middle of nowhwere Vermont when he spots a lone cottage in the distance.  Not wanting to freeze before he makes it to Maine for the wedding, Stan decides to try and walk to the place.  He is dumbfounded when he finds the place is run by the forest ranger Dana Freeman that he was supposed to pick up along the way for his mentor and friend in Maine.  He discovers that Dana is no rough woman he thought she'd be and is fastly becoming tempted by her cool attitude and very womanly curves under the heavy sweater she wears.  After realizing they are stuck, Stan calls his best friend Sam and they too are picked up along the way with the Senior Santa Brigade!<br />A bus full of wacky and nosey seniors, the trio of friends and trio of women soon learn that getting to Snowdon is going to have to be a group effort!  Amid storms, strandings in lodges, snowbanks that can't be moved,(but with the wily ways of the bus's driver, a NASCAR driver from tears past and a list of old boyfriends that owe her favors, anything can happen) charity stops along the way, two 'Dr. Ruth' wannabes, Mr. Senior-Studmuffin, A Retired Marine Drill Instructor, Cyber Granny, and the rest of the wacky bunch, love blooms between the three couples.  Although there wasn't nearly enough room for real in-depth introspection into each couple's thoughts and feelings, the story was well worth the read and extremely funny and touching.  If only I could've been on that bus...Stan, watch out hahahaha<br />Tracy Talley~@run by the forest ranger Dana Freeman that he was supposed to pick up along the way for his mentor and friend in Maine.

As the reader you have to really make believe and just 'go with the flow' to enjoy this tale.  Since Mrs. Hill is by far my favorite author out there, I did just that and loved the story she was telling, via Elvis the Godfather style.  A new take on the 'Happily Ever After', 'Cinderella' tale, I found it charming and hysterical, all Sandra Hill trademarks.  When you take a 'shark' stockbroker named Cynthia and a 'Prince' named P.T who runs one of the most upscale shoe companies in Manhattan, throw them together via lawsuit, you get funny funny funny!!!<br />~There was once a prince in a magic kingdom who was loved by all and along came a beautiful woman, you might say she somewhat resembled Cinderella.  The Kingdom was Manhattan and the prince was a toad, well, at least that's was Cynthia 'the shark' Sullivan is saying as she pickets outside his company's main office in New York!<br />She has developed a corn from the toad's 'magical' and very expensive shoes and in turn has broken three toes trying to work in them on the stock exchange floor!  Now she has lost her lucrative job and her mortgage to the posh apartment is up in the air!  She wants the 'Prince of Toads' in a stranglehold!  The very handsome prince wants to settle this little 'inconvience' before his company hits the stocks!<br />Prince Perico Tomas de la Ferrama has been having a bad day and seeing the 'corn princess' is not making it any better.  Why now when they were about to hit the stock exchange?  He and his three partners had been working night and day trying to make a small wholesale shoe company what it was today, 5 years later it was selling on 5th Ave!<br />Just when he thought things could get no worse, his stepsisters kidnap the corn princess and take her off to his crumbling heap of a castle in the...Catskills?  Along with his sister's boyfriend, Elmer Presley who claims to be his fairy godfather and a pack of smelly hounds.  Why him?  Now he must drive up there in his orange pickup truck and rescue the woman before his wicked stepsisters do something really dumb and he loses his company and his mind!<br />Cynthia and P.T soon find out that his wily sisters have no intention of letting her go unless they agree to a plot that will guarantee the company not getting sued.  That is where Elmer comes in and the entire goofball side characters wreck havoc!<br />Now the problem is not if they will survive being held captive in a castle in New York, but can they stop falling in love?  P.T's secret could ruin any happiness they might have, but the 'midnight ball' will reveal the real 'pumpkin coach' and the real 'tiara'...that is if the mafia doesn't get to them first...<br />Really heartwarming and different!

This is the 5th book in Mrs. Hill's uncompareable Viking series that began in \\"Reluctant Viking\\" and continued on through, \\"The Outlaw Viking\\", \\"The Tarnished Lady\\", \\"The Bewitched Viking\\" and now \\"THE BLUE VIKING\\", with the lead male being Rurik the Blue Viking.<br />He was introduced to us in \\"The Bewitched Viking\\" as Tykir's best friend who suffered a blue mark cast upon his vain face by an angry witch from Scotland.  Now in his own story, Rurik has to find the witch named Maire of the Moors to remove the mark, else his betrothed will not marry him back home in the North Lands.  But finding the elusive Maire is another challenge.  He has been looking for almost 5 years with no luck.<br />Could his life get any worse?  Never say never, for Rurik \\"The Great\\", or at least that is what Bothar the Skald calls him, (his best friend Tykir's bad idea of a joke sending Bothar along with him to find the witch)things do indeed get worse when he comes upon her in a cage held captive by a warring clan.  Also the fact that Rurik is now angry when he feels sparks fly again after 5 years between them when they lock eyes.  Or it could be that he hates eating haggis, and Maire's pantry has plenty of it, just to spite him.  Or the god-awful bagpipe lessons that Bothar is determined to take while they are there...or maybe, just maybe it's the fact that he is sure the witch has placed a curse on him for good this time when he feels his heart fall for the wilesome witch of the moors...<br />Maire Campbell has no time for the man that left her high and dry 5 years ago.  He took her innocence and left her with a secret that she has hidden fiercely.  Now he has come looking for her to remove the zigzag blue mark she accidentally cursed on his vain face.  The only problem is she isn't a very good witch at all, in fact she is known throughout the clan and even neighboring clans how inept she is.  Another problem is Rurik refuses to leave until she removes it.  How will she keep her secret from him and fight off a warring MacNabs?  She has no idea, but that is the least of her problems she soon learns, her heart is remembering his touch and it remembers her heartbreak when he left her alone to face a unwanted marriage full of anger and hate.<br />Will one night of fierce lovemaking cure all or end all? Will Rurik be able to look past the mark and see his love for a woman he deserted years ago before its too late?  Or will the MacNabs capture the Laird Campbell and kill her secret...from him and fight off a warring MacNabs?  She has no idea, but that is the least of her problems she soon learns, her heart is remembering his touch and it remembers her heartbreak when he left her alone to face a unwanted marriage full of anger and hate.<br />Will one night of fierce lovemaking cure all or end all?

This is the second book I have read by Ms. Johnson(first being 'Love Storm' 2 yrs ago)and I should've known. Nothing has changed. Not that I am knocking her for writing it, writing is a difficult process and I commend her for it, but this wasn't, shall we say, my 'cup of tea'.<br />The hero, Pasha Duras was too callous and sex starved to be believable as a 'romance hero' and Trixi was too dimwitted to be a true 'romance heroine'. The two had sex nonstop throughout the book and it got tiring. It was more like a porno with an elaborate plot. The history is great and very interesting, and I wish Ms. Johnson would try and write more romance into her stories and bring the characters more to life. All the sex, and I mean sex, cause there is pages and pages of just explicit sex here, just seems to cloud the plot. I found the plot interesting, but everytime I was just getting into it more, the sex came back, full force, lol. Don't get me wrong here, I read Beatrice Small and other 'frank' writers, but this was just tedious.<br />~Beatrix Grosvenor, or Trixi as she is known, was caught in a bad postion when she was found locked in a Parisian apartment, nude and horrified while her captor lay dead with an ax through his skull. All the months of being held prisoner by the man was enough to drive her crazy, but when the man was murdered right in front of her, Trixi felt like she had lost her mind!<br />Pasha Duras was also stunned to find the very man he wanted to strangle already dead and a nude woman standing on the bed in shock. Did she kill him? No, she couldn't have, she wasn't covered in blood and the weapon was missing. There was something about her that made him want to shelter and protect her. Soon the notorious rake of Paris found himself accompanying her home to Kent, England and falling in love. But love would come with a price...Trixi was being hunted by someone intent on killing her and her son. Pasha would have to open his heart and mind in order to save her. A hard feat for a rake of his repute...<br />I heartily wish it were a better tale, but the sex got in the way for me and ruined the intricate plot Ms. Johnson wove so well...a shame...<br />Tracy Talley~@ard feat for a rake of his repute...<br />I heartily wish it were a better tale, but the sex got in the way for me and ruined the intricate plot Ms. Johnson wove so well...a shame...<br />Tracy Talley~@	2002-01-28

If this is one of her first novels and the other reviews say she didn't hit her mark with this and her newer works are much better, then I say bring them on! This was great! I loved it! Although not much in the line for good suspense, it did give you the creeps at times and we always knew who the rapist was. All that aside, the meager suspense came in when we had to watch and wonder when the rapist would strike. The characters were good and I especially liked the strong female lead of a doctor named Ivy. She wasn't whiny or scared the entire book when she knew a rapist had her number and name. She dealt with it on a mature level and tried to help as much as she could with the cops. The male lead of Vincent was good, albeit a little too macho at times for me, but he was spicy in the storyline. But he did do good police work and his character had many flaws and he was real.<br />Ms. Anderson sure did her homework for this novel. I learned so much reading it besides enjoying the fast-paced tale. She explained in detail how the police go about investigating rape cases and how they view the victims and criminals. She showed how they can be sympathetic and harsh at the same time. She also gave stats on serial rapists and statistics on rapes in general. All very informative. We were also very convinced withe the character of Ivy, the ER doctor. The details made me feel as if I were right there in the ER!<br />~For him, the thrill of the hunt is his aphrodesiac. He strikes only when the moon is full. He terrorizes his victims and leaves them with his 'calling card', a broken heart. He is a serial rapist that has been roaming the streets of Seattle mercilessly for months now and the police have nothing. The problem now, he has fixed his gaze on one doctor named Ivy Pennington. He is determined to have her....at any cost. His new hurdle is a tenatious cop named Vincent D'Ambruzzi.<br />Detective D'Ambruzzi is not getting any closer to solving this case. And now his new obstacle is his beautiful nextdoor neighbor Ivy Pennington. Getting off on the wrong foot, he finds out she is an ER doctor and in no mood for his macho ways. Another full moon hits and so does the rapist known as 'Hart'. Vincent also learns that Hart wants Ivy. Hart wants to break her heart and Vincent finds he is falling in love with the doctor and begins to scour the city for the rapist. But will he find him before he gets to her? Will Vincent's past ruin his chances with her? Can Ivy get past his suspicious nature before its too late?<br />Heartpounding and a real thrill ride! A sure hit!

This is actually the prequel to Ms. MacGregor's first book 'A Pirate of Her Own', but it wasn't written until after it.  This was a better book and I enjoyed it a lot!  The passion between the male and female leads (Jack and Lorelei)were so real I felt as if they really existed!  I haven't read a pirate romance with a pirate like Jack.  He was so kindhearted and powerful at the same time I swore I felt faint haha...  What I also loved about this book was the fact that Jack wasn't treating Lori badly because he wanted revenge against her fiance's father, instead he tried to shield her from the truth of her future father-in-law.  Ms. Macgragor has a knack of getting into your heart with the witty way she writes and the way she makes her male leads so believeable as pirates of the time, yet so deep and caring.  Very hard to put into words, but this book was excellent!  The humor she is known to weave into her stories was there everywhere and made me smile and laugh out loud more than once.  The entire tale pretty much took place aboard the ship she was captured on and it never got boring or tedious as some are wont to do when they stay on the ship the entire tale.<br />~Black Jack Rhys has a score to settle with his worst enemy.  He wasn't thinking when he decided on a whim to kidnap his adversary's fiancee!  A fiery redhead that would turn his life upseide down with just her smile.  Jack being known for his prowess in the bedroom was about to learn a valuable lesson on women...never under estimate the power of love.<br />Lorelei Dupree was bored.  She wanted adventure and some fun in her life before she married her childhood love Justin.  So she talks him into letting her help him trap the infamous pirate Black Jack.  The only thing that could go wrong...did.  Taken captive, Lori is a little more than shocked to learn she is wildly attracted to the gorgeous pirate, but is aghast at his dasterdly deeds he is known for.  But she soon finds out that not is all as it seems...who is Black Jack Rhys?  Is he the monster society has painted him to be or is he the cunning, yet caring man she has grown to know.  Finding out that he is truly the 'master of seduction' doesn't help her waning senses and she soon finds she wants this mystery man.  Can she snare him?  Is it worth the try?  Why not...when you're the granddaughter of the infamous Anne Bonny!<br />A real pleaser, Jack is everything pirate dreams are made of and no wimpy heroine to drag him down.  The history was great and the scenes were so real.  Even though the take on the plot was a bit familar with other pirate romances, I found it refreshing and unique.<br />Tracy Talley~@s...who is Black Jack Rhys?

I beg to differ with most of the reviews for this classic.  It was a great book, a real classic Woodiwiss, but definately not my favorite medieval romance.  I thought 'The Flame and the Flower' was a much better book by her.  The problem with 'The Wolf and the Dove' was the endless talk and day to day activity in the castle.  I grew bored with it and wished for some serious action scenes or battle scenes since it was taking place during the rein of William the Conqueror in 1066.  It was sorely lacking in that department and from the on I lost interest.  The plot was solely centered around the female lead and male lead and not much interaction with the vivid history around them.  I also agree with another reviewer that said this book lagged and got a little boring then it picked up later on.  The characters were well written and the story very real, but the plot kinda dragged.  Too much centering on the little squabbles between the two main characters.  I also thought the female lead of Aislinn was too forgiving and didn't seem to take what happened to her father and mother seriously enough to fight off the male lead of Wulfgar.  It kind of bothered me and hindered the story.  What they did to her family and herself for that matter was unforgivable and she seemed to just accept her fate and brushed her 'horror' off like some trivial incident.  While the male lead of Wulfgar seemed to be stuck on his childhood ordeal of being a 'bastard' to a knight and cast aside.  We as the reader are supposed to feel bad for him and sympathize with his plight, but we're also supposed to forgive and forget what he and his men do to Aislinn and her family.  I found that hard to swallow and therefore found the tale not the best in medieval romance by a long shot...try instead 'Kingdom of Dreams' by Judith McNaught for the very best in medieval romance.<br />~Wulfgar, the 'Iron Wolf of Normandy' sweeps in like some bringer of death when he and his men desend on the hapless village of a Saxon princess and her proud family.  He intends to claim it as his own, due his prize for helping William, the Conqueror King who finally took England as his own in 1066.  What he is not expecting is a stunning woman of strong will who does not bend to his whim just because he is the 'Iron Wolf' everyone fears.  The Norman knight must fight for her love as her hatred burns for him and his kind before another would claim her as his own...<br />Aislinn is not prepared for the fires that burn in her treacherous heart to betray her when she falls for the Norman knight who destroyed her home and family.  But what is worse?  The Norman knight who claims her as his own, or the one who is willing to kill to make her his own...The Iron Wolf must find who is traitor and who would try to take what is his.

As with every one of Ms. Mason's books, they are a treat from a long day and I enjoy them.  This too was one treat and I am excited to read the other two books in the trilogy.  The complaint I had with this one, about the outlaw brother Rafe Gentry, was the fact that he got into too many situations that had me saying to myself, 'alright, enough, this is a little too much, even for me to believe'.  I mean, 3 different raps and all of them easily explained?  And they don't happen by a chain of events, but by accident?  Nope, too much.  Rafe was a typical Mason 'hero', by that I mean he was sexy and strong and the kind of guy you wish you knew, but don't, lol.  He is selfless and honorable and the kind of guy you can always depend on.  The heroine Angela, I wasn't too impressed with.  She was a little too trusting and kept getting herself into dangerous messes that Rafe had to keep getting her out of, simply, in my opinion, because she was kinda...dare I say, dense?  Yeah, dense.  Rafe deserved someone smarter and more apt to trust him when he risked his neck for her numerous times.  She trusted everyone else...except Rafe..the ONLY person helping her and saving her from herself.  Other than that little petpeive, I thought the plot was great and had a lot of heart-stopping action (which I always look forward to in a Mason book) with plenty of romance thrown in to keep you smiling.  Mason always weaves a tale of greed, treachery and impossible odds that the characters must overcome.  This, the first in the 'OUTLAW' trilogy, did not disappoint.<br />~Rafe Gentry was about to hang from a tree in some small town for a crime he didn't commit.  A lynch mob has taken him from the cell and condemed him before he was to sit trial.  When suddenly an angel with golden hair and a voice and face to match appeared trying to save him.  Who was she?  And why was she telling them she was his fiancee?<br />Angela Abbot was no angel, despite what her name and voice claimed.  She was known as Sister Angela and couldn't abide to see a man hanged, especially one like this one.  He had the eyes of an innocent man about to die.  So she did something she couldn't believe, she claimed he was her fiance who was supposed to wait her in Colorado.  Why?  She wasn't so sure herself.  When things couldn't possibly get any worse, they did.  They were being forced into a hasty wedding in the same town!  Now what?<br />Angela didn't need this extra problem on her hands when she needed to get to her father's mine in the mountains and find out if he was murdered.  Hopefully, this added 'problem' would just go on his way, but he didn't.  Not at first.  Then Angela had a hard time wondering why she wanted him to leave in the first place.<br />Rafe didn't want to drag Angela into his mess of a life.  He was wanted and was on the run.  The sooner he got away from her the better, but his heart was calling her and he couldn't seem to leave her.  The fire was too strong for them to deny and before they knew it, they couldn't survive without each other...but first he would have to clear his name and find out who was trying to kill Angela...n as Sister Angela and couldn't abide to see a man hanged, especially one like this one.

I was surprised I liked this book so much, because the cover is a cartoon and I was like, 'ugh, I dont know, but it sounds good', boy am I glad I read it and not judged a book by its cover!  The male lead was perfect!  Sexy and smart and sensitive.  The ONLY two complaints I have with this book is the female lead(the fugitive) is kinda clingy and expects miracles out of John (the cop-male lead) but the plot made up for this flaw.  The other complaint I had was that the chase between the crazy bounty hunter and Renee (female lead and the fugitive) ended too quickly and that the cabin scenes weren't enough.  Other than that, it was great!  Action, chase scenes and romance....ahhhh....was all perfect.  John's family was wacky and fun and I am excited to read Ms. Graves next book about John's brother Alex.  The bounty hunter was one of my favorites and added tons of humor to the story.  Lots of funny scenes and humorous situations to make you laugh out loud.  Especially the McDonald's scene...I will leave it to the imagination, or until you read it for yourself.  Just remember...the drive-through and a fugitive and a cell phone....he he he he....<br />~Renee Esterhaus is on the run for a robbery she didn't commit.  Now she is stuck in the middle of a small town in Texas with no money and a broken car and a crazy bounty hunter hot on her trail.  With no more ideas and nothing left to do, she pulls together a scewy plan to save her hide.  She will proposition the first guy she sees for one night of incredible sex in exchange for a ride out of town.  The handsome man she finds sitting at the small coffee shop in 'hillbilly' Texas turns out to be a cop with a steel pair of handcuffs and no patience for criminals!  This could only happen to her!<br />John DeMarco is on a much needed rest from his job as a detective in the piney woods where he is using the cabin his boss has given him to use to think.  What he doesn't expect to encounter is a beautiful woman with a tempting proposal that he quickly learns was a way to trick him into getting her out of 'Dodge'!  Besides the crazy bounty hunter that is after her and the story she tells him, he can't help but think she is innocent.  Now, how to prove it?  John is about to make one of the biggest mistakes of his life in order to prove to himself that Renee or Alice, as she is calling herself, is the angel she appears to be.  But with what price?  Harboring is a felony...but is love?  Is she who she claims to be?  Or some con artist who has perfected the art of lying so much that she can hide it in her eyes...<br />Well worth the money!

This is the first book I have ever read where the heroine was the one who saves the hero.  It was awesome!  I loved it!  Talk about 'bad boy'!!!  This was the ULTIMATE in bad boys.  No weak female lead here with the desire to 'turn him around' for her benefit.  The heroine, Alyson James, is all woman, but very real and simply wants to help the hero, Brandon Carlyle, from his demons that plague him.  Lots of heated scenes here and the suspense is real and will make your heart beat a little faster.  This would be excellent in the theatre!<br />~Hollywood bad boy, Brandon Carlyle, is being stalked and harassed by some woman calling herself &quot;Anticipating' for the past 5 years.  Up until now he has ignored her and tried to live his life.  The only problem though is he has spent the last 3 years in prison for manslaughter.  His acting career on the rocks, he goes home to Ticky Creek, Texas for a break and a much needed rest when the stalker Anticipating has found him again and this time wants him dead!<br />A beautiful stranger, Alyson James is going to get the story of her life, the only problem is the hollywood 'hellion' doesn't want anyone around while he spends endless hours hanging around his uncles and aunts farm.  Aly knows a lot about him, since she was the very reporter who opened the story of his alcoholism so many years ago, but he doesn't know she was the one who practically ruined his life and career with that story.  Now she intends to somewhat, make 'ammends' with an autobiography with his own words, but she soon learns, a menacing stalker is after him and now her as she gets too close.  Secrets abound in the small town and the swamps hold many more dark secrets Aly must solve before its too late.  Anticipating is here...she is waiting...Aly can't seem to stop falling in love with the man who's heart and soul is deeper than an ocean and filled with sorrow.  She must save him...save him from himself and a woman calling herself Anticipating...<br />Unbelieveable!  Worthy of 10 stars!  The suspense is creepy and Ms. Sutcliffe really takes us on a rollarcoaster ride of emotions and secrets.  I would love to see this on the big screen, it would be a hit!  (and man oh man is Brandon sexy...whew...)<br />Tracy Talley~@ieveable!  Worthy of 10 stars!

Talk about HOT!  Man, this was sizzling off the pages!  Even though the shortness of the book was putting me off of reading it, I am sure glad I did decide to pick it up!  The guy, Grant Sullivan, will be in my top 'hottest' guys list from a book from now on! If only I could find myself taken captive by some rebel group in South America(not that I'd wish it, but...)and have someone like Grant come save me and drag me through the jungle for days while the bad guys were hot on our trail...man, that would be nice...but anyways, sorry, off the topic here, lol.  The hero was HOT HOT HOT and even HOTTER!  He was deep, dark and brooding, everything a bad boy should be...(sigh)  And Jane was no 'weak-damsel-in-distress'.  She was highly intelligent and full of fire.  Well worth having Grant.<br />~Jane Hamilton Greer, divorcee at 29 and being held captive in Costa Rica by a group of rebels is shocked to find a man, at least the size of a wrestler and gorgeous to boot wearing camaflauge and sporting guns breaking into her room so quiet you would have thought he was a panther.  In a scuffle, not knowing who or what he was she is taken from the encampment via over the 'brute's' shoulders into the impenetrable jungle and into the inky darkness.  Who is he?  Another goon kidnapping her to get the film?<br />Grant Sullivan had just retired and bought a farm out in the Tennesee mountians when he got a call to rescue a spoiled richgirl apparently dabbling in espionage.  One of the US's top agents and known for his expertise, he was sent to Costa Rica expecting to rescue a whining spoiled brat that got herself in too deep with the wrong guy but was stunned to find an intelligent woman who had gotten mixed up with the wrong people at the wrong time.  She held a deep and terrifying piece of evidence that the rebels and goverments were killing to posess.  She was trying desperately to do it herself, but with the strong help of Grant, she is able to breathe a sigh of relief.  They are on the run through the world's most dangerous rain forests all in an attempt to get out or be killed.  In the process, they realize they are falling in love and shouldn't.  Grant has too many deep seeded memories from his work and has grown hard and cold.  Jane sees his vulnerability and digs deeper and deeper until she breaks through but then realizes he and her should never have met.  They are from two different worlds.  Life outside the jungle was harsh and real.  It didn't have room for mistakes.  But Grant must understand that he just made one by letting her go...<br />Unbelievable!  Excellent!  'Romancing the Stone' watch out!  Action, adventure, spies, treachery and love...a sure winner!

This is a MUST if you love real 'prince charming-Cinderella-type' stories!  It had the wicked stepmother (worse than Cinderella's by the way) two wicked stepsisters and a chance for an illegitamate daughter of a deceased earl to attend the 'ball of the season' in style!  BUT...she must return by midnight before the wicked stepmother realizes her late husband's 'love child' has duped her!  Can she do it?  What if the 'prince charming' of this tale was none other one of the most handsome of the famous Bridgerton brood?  Benedict Bridgerton to be exact???  This is the third book in the series and wonderfully entertaining!  A real twist on the 'striking midnight' cliche!<br />~Sophie Beckett was shocked herself that she was able to pull off the daring stunt and sneak into Lady Bridgerton's famed masquerade ball, but what she didn't realize was that she captured the heart of one of the elusive Bridgerton brood forever!  Now as the clock strikes midnight and she must go home to a life as dull as wood and scrub floors and wait on her wicked stepmother and sisters, she dreams of what 'could've been' had her father actually acknowledged her for more than just his by-blow with a maid so many years past.  But Fate has a weird way of making dreams come true...or do they?<br />Benedict Bridgerton wasn't prepared for the vision in silver that graced his mother's hall.  Who was she?  He was instantly in love.  Just when he thought he found the love of his life, she was gone.  Years later, after dreaming of the woman in silver, he comes upon a helpless woman who stirs a memory...but, it can't be her...the vison in silver...for this woman was dirty, skinny and a housemaid.  But, ever the gentleman, Benedict saves her from a fate worse than death and helps to secure her a job and roof over her head.  This is when things become too complicated for him to bear...who IS she?  And why does she regard him as of she KNOWS him from somewhere?  Why do her eyes make him think of that night at the ball?  He is determined to find out and in the process he finds himself in love with the mystery woman garbed in maid's clothing.  And when he does find out who she is, will he sacrifice his position in society for her?  Or will he let her blow in the wind like everyone else and lose his chance at 'happily ever after'...<br />Great read!  The author also teases us at the end with the identity of the ever mysterious Lady Whistledown.  I have the feeling the next book in this excellent series will be about her!  I can't wait!

What I loved most about this story was that the heroine was no utterly gorgeous woman who took the men's breath away and thus captured the elusive viscount, also the most elusive and eligable bachelor in London!  She was average and very intelligent.  She captured the gorgeous viscount just by being herself.  Anthony (the viscount) didn't realize he had fallen for the wrong sister at first until it was too late.  I LOVED this story and the hero of Viscount Anthony Bridgerton (eldest brother of the Bridgerton brood begun in 'The Duke and I' with his eldest sister Daphne)!  Anthony was sweet, yet strong and determined to finally marry and settle down after years of bachelorhood and being labled the most notorious rake in all of England in 1814.  I was very happy to see that Ms. Quinn used a different approach to the all-too-familar tale of the notorious rake who fell for the most gorgeous woman of the season.  This rake fell for the most 'unseen' 'wallflower' of the season and potential spinster at the ripe old age of 21.  Very impressed Ms. Quinn!<br />~The infamous and very mysterious Lady Whistledown is predicting that this season, April 1814 will finally see the consumate rake and most eligable bachelor, Viscount Anthony Bridgerton to settle down and take a wife.  Watch out ladies!  But the only thing the mysterious columnist has gotten wrong this time is that the viscount has already picked a wife!  He has picked Edwina Sheffield, the 'belle of the season', a blonde beauty sought after by all the besotted men.  He picks her simply because of her blinding beauty and the knowledge that he, the biggest rake and most responsible brother the ton has ever seen will surely not fall in love with her.  He cannot afford that luxury.  Love caused heartache and he had enough of that emotion.  All he was concerned with now was protecting his large brood of brothers and sisters and his widowed mother and securing an heir without falling in love, if that was possible.  The problem?  Miss Edwina Sheffield, a diamond of the first water had a very very overprotective older sister named Kate who was also having her first season, at the age of 21!  Anthony would soon learn he would have to go through Kate first to get to Edwina.  Can he do it?  With his heart intact?<br />Kate Sheffield has promised her younger sister that she would help her find a respectable husband and make sure he was good to her.  Kate by all society's standards was no beauty.  Long brown hair and brown eyes, tall and outspoken, she was no simpering belle of the ball and hadn't recieved one proposal.  Her father was dead and her stepmother hadn't the money to give the girls two seperate seasons, so they were out in the same year.  Which didn't do well.  The only Miss Sheffield that any of the men saw was Edwina and Kate was simply...there.  An aging spinster with no hope to marry.  It was pretty much up to Edwina, 17 and gorgeous with a heart of gold to snag a wealthy and suitable husband to help her mother and sister.  But she would only approve of the man her sister chose.<br />The rogue Anthony wasn't going to do well with Kate.  He was far too scandalous and reprehensible for her sweet and gentle sister.  But making the determined man see this was another story.  Alas a battle of wills ensues and they find themselves fighting and bickering more than they find themselves paying Edwina any attention.  Soon all that matters to Kate is to keep the scoundrel away from Edwina at all costs!  But Kate finds herself hopelessy falling for the devilish rake and Anthony can't remember which sister he was trying to fight for!  All he knows is he cannot choose Kate, his heart would be lost forever...<br />Ahhh, I just loved this story and can't recommend it enough.  Contrary to most books with gorgeous siblings and more average ones, Edwina is honest to a fault and extremely dedicated to her older sister.  I was happy to see the two so dedicated to one another and no jealousy keeping them apart.  Edwina truly did not know how beautiful she was and Kate didn't envy her for it or try to belittle her.  Kate was beautiful, but in society's shallow eyes she was plain and boring.  It took a real man to see this and Anthony saw it, immediately, even thougyh it took him awhile to admit to loving her.  Very impressive Ms. Quinn!  Thank-you for the hours of enjoyment!<br />(1. THE DUKE AND I) (2. THE VISCOUNT WHO LOVED ME) (3. AN OFFER FROM A GENTLEMAN)<br />Tracy Talley~@ng them apart.

It began in 'Sea Swept', 'Rising Tides' and now finally 'Inner Harbor'.  The last brother Phillip finds his true love and alot of other things along the way in this installment.  All the loose ends are finally tied up and the story of Ray Quinn's son Seth is finally revealed.  I enjoyed this one the most of the three.  Both Phillip and Sybill were strong characters and I like what Ms. Roberts did with Sybill's character and who she was.  It was a nice twist.<br />~The third and last novel in the Quinn trilogy tells the story of Phillip Quinn, a high powered ad exec living in Baltimore and the last of the Quinn brothers still single.  The Quinn family saved him from a life a crime of theft and street running when he was a boy.  One fateful night he nearly died and Ray and Stella Quinn saved his life.  He never forgot them or their selfless generosity.  The only way he sees fit to somewhat pay Ray back is to help stop the blackmailing his now dead 'father' experienced by a woman who literally sold her only son Seth to him.  The trick was, was to find the elusive woman who was wrecking havok on their lives.<br />Sybill needs to find the little boy she remembers from 6 long years ago before things completely fall apart.  Did the Quinn's really steal Seth from his mother?  Who were these people?  Sybill is about to find out.  She is on a personal mission and when she sees him, things aren't what they seem.  The Quinn brothers are gentle with him and seem to love him...as she is seeming to fall for the Quinn brother named Phillip.  When her identity is revealed, the tenuous grip she has on him falls apart as she now must defend herself against the protective family and find the truth.<br />Can Phillip trust her knowing who she is?  Can he look past it to find love?  Can they together save Seth from an uncaring mother who wants him for money?  Will Fate solve their dilemma?  Sybill finds out that blood can indeed be thicker than water and Phillip finds that he can learn to trust again and life will be good again, just as Ray and Stella planned it.<br />Good trilogy, worth the read!!!p finds that he can learn to trust again and life will be good again, just as Ray and Stella planned it.<br />Good trilogy, worth the read!!!	2001-12-20

This had me almost falling asleep.  I shouldn't be so negative considering I really liked her other books so much, but this one was BORING.  The hero was boring and held nothing to keep my interest.  He was overly brooding and seemed to 'latch' onto Arabella (the heroine) too fast.  Personally I thought Arabella was a little spoiled and stuck-up for my tastes, but to each his own.  The hero John Blackwell was...I don't know, too 'whiny', I think the word is that I am looking for.  I didn't much like Arabella either, but I still think she could've done better than him.  Also the details in this book became monotonous.  Quinn's other books have humor and action, this lacked both.  The humor was lackluster and the action was tepid.  I would suggest her other books, such as, 'The Duke and I', and 'How to Marry A Marquis', for starters.  But this is good to read if you want to keep track of all the characters in the books and know who they are when they pop up in other books.  Since Quinn is known to do that quite often.<br />~Lady Arabella Blydon meets Lord John Blackwell by accident when she accidentally trespasses on his property.  Quickly she senses deep hatred and deep and dark secrets that he wants to keep hidden.  Quickly she becomes facinated by his brooding and dark personality.  By unlike her curiosity, he doesn't want anything to do with the innocent 'chit' and warns her to stay away from him.<br />Lord John Blackwell is new to his title and his lands he has aquired for perticipating in the military.  All his life, the seventh child of an Earl and pretty much forgotten, he has made his own way.  Until one fateful day in the army, he has kept a secret hidden from everyone.  If it ever got out, he would be shunned.  Wounded and battered, both physically and mentally, John has no time or patience for an innocent girl who thinks he is 'too mysterious' to pass up.  But Belle's persistance makes him see he can love and he deserves to love.  The only thing holding him back is his dark past and someone who wants him dead for it...<br />Can he overcome his past and let Belle in on what he has done?  Will she leave him?  Can he risk it?  Will the love of an Earl's daughter heal his ragged heart and help him see the light?<br />I really thought it would be enjoyable considering the plot, but it just dragged.  The 'secret' is kinda weird and when the reader finds out what it is and why he is so distraught, you feel angry and badly, but then you start to get irritated with him and his commonsense.  There is no reason to keep the 'secret' inside.  Actually, I found no reason to keep the secret at all.  See for yourself...but I will say, it is a very mediocre read and not worthy of Ms. Quinn's name.<br />Tracy Talley~@s persistance makes him see he can love and he deserves to love.

The characters were fun and I hoped it would never end, but it did.  Luckily this book is only the beginning of a series called the Bridgerton Series.  This one is about Daphne, the oldest daughter of the family.  Talk about humor and even some serious parts that were heartwarming.  The type of people you wish you knew.<br />~Daphne Bridgerton, the daughter of a Viscount and the eldest daughter of eight children is tired of the social whirl and the ton's endless matchmaking going on.  She wants love, love like her mother and father shared.  She will settle for no less.  Even if she has to pretend to be courted by a Duke that has NO intention of EVER getting married!<br />The Duke of Hastings, Simon Basset, has lived a life of trying to overcome his secret problem that has caused his father to pretty much abandon him as a son.  When his father dies, Simon feels no grief, just relief.  But the scars haven't healed from a horrible childhood.  His revenge on it, to never marry and let the illustrious title of Dukedom die a quiet death when he does.  The plan...pretend to court his best friend Anthony Bridgerton's sister in order to keep the ton's matchmakers at bay and out of his hair until he can come up with a better idea.  What he realizes is that Daphne is not some silly girl he can play 'pretend' with.<br />The two get caught up in their own lie and they find themselves wishing it were all real.  Then when an incident causes Daphne's eldest brother and Simon's best friend for so many years to cry foul, a friendship is tested and the 'game' has come to an end.  Will Simon, the new Duke of Hastings learn to forget his father's evil presense in his memory?  Or will he let the memories take control of his life and make him lose the best thing to come into his life...Daphne must uncover the secret that is about to distroy Simon forever and her...<br />This is well worth the money.  Highly recommended.  Anthony's story is &quot;The Viscount Who Loved Me&quot;, the second book in the series.

I think it's because I liked Ethan more than Cameron.  Ethan is more down-to-earth and seems to understand hard work and responsibility than his brother Cameron.  Ethan seem more determined to make things work for the brothers and their budding business of boatbuilding.  The romance between Ethan and Grace, an old family friend was much sweeter and more believeable than the one between Cameron and the social worker Anna.<br />~Ethan Quinn shares his father's love of boatbuilding and the shores of Maryland and Chesapeake Bay.  He is determined to make this boatbuilding venture work out to its fullest.  They have their father's last dying wish of seeing to a new member of the family, Seth have a good life.

She is trying to make the courts see that his life is in danger by staying with a mother that uses him and takes money for favors.  Anna also knows a deep and dark secret she is hiding from the world about one of the brothers.<br />Grace Monroe has known Ethan all her life and loved him all her life.  She never believes he would love her return, but when things get tangled and she realizes he loves her as much as she loves him, she must also face a horror that is threatening to keep them apart.<br />Can Ethan overcome his past and grab onto the only love and happiness he wants?

Can Cameron deal with knowing Seth might suffer the same fate as he when he was young?  The last installment is about the last brother, Phillip.  The sure and level-headed one.

Suddenly he suffers a massive heart attack and leaves the three angry wives to sift through his muddled life.<br />Fate is nowhere near done with the women and they find themselves in trouble with the law when they are all suspected of killing the man and conspiring with each other, only they all know each one would never do such a cold-blooded thing.<br />Clues soon begin to surface and the truth is more shocking than what they had imagined.  Now they are all in danger and must trust one another to survive this mess!<br />Very funny and witty.  I will always remember these characters!  They were all so different, yet I connected with them all and smiled throughout the book.  But I have to say, my favorite was Raymond's first wife Beatrix, she was spunky and no-nonsense.  The way she handles the women are nothing less than hysterical.  Very enjoyable, but I must say, there isn't much romance in the book, its more of a comedy/mystery.  But I didn't mind.  The wives more than make up for any romance lost in the pages!  Well worth the money!!!<br />Tracy Talley~@Very enjoyable, but I must say, there isn't much romance in the book, its more of a comedy/mystery.  But I didn't mind.

I usually don't have much problem guessing the killer's identity, but this time I was truly baffled and honestly shocked when the person was revealed!  Impressed too, cause Ms. Roberts used a most unusual person and I admire her for trying this approach!  Who would've thought?!  Also my first book by this author and I will certainly start reading all by her!<br />~In a small Southern town called Innocence in the middle of the swamps of Mississippi, evil is lurking.  A brutal and merciless killer is claiming the lives of the town's most beautiful women.  People are scared for in their mist lurks a killer, a killer so vile and evil that the town is left second guessing each other's personalities.  Is it their own next-door neighbor?<br />A world-famous concert violinist, Caroline Waverly is trying to find some peace and quiet in her hectic life when she decides to leave her secure life in Philadelphia and stroll into her grandmother's house in Innocence, Mississippi after she has died.  Caroline doesn't expect to be caught up in a horrible manhunt for a serial killer!  Or to be seduced by the town 'playboy' the infamous Tucker Longstreet!<br />Tucker is used to fast women and even faster cars, he has no time for dallying with 'good girls' until he nearly crashes his 'fast car' into the new neighbor down the road, a cute blonde by the name of Caroline Waverly.  He knew her grandmother since he was a boy and cannot believe his eyes!  'Caro,' as she was known in town as, had grown into a stunningly sexy blonde that seemed to take his breath away until she opened her mouth...she hated 'men like him.'  'Playboys,' 'Rakes', that sort of men.  But Tucker wasn't to be daunted, he wanted her and he would do anything to get her.  He would use his infamous Longstreet charm to woo her, except Tucker realized, it wasn't working on her...<br />Caroline has her hands full of this man when she is horribly broguth back to earth with the discovery of yet another body, this time on her land and in her lake.  Tucker's latest girlfriend...was the roguish man she had started to find attractive the serial killer?  Weird that all the women were ex-lovers of his...<br />I truly did not realize who the killer was and was honestly in shock at the realization!  WOW!  A definate twist on this neatly done story that kept you guessing and on edge!  The small-town aspect was the thing that kept you wondering in anxiety of who the person was.  When you think you figured the person out, you are proved wrong and then you have to start over and find yourself wondering who in the world it could be!  Is it the person you LEAST expected???  Truly gripping and different!  The romance was great and the chemistry was real.  I love the way Ms. Roberts wrote the dialog as it would really have been between the townsfolk and the things they really do behind closed doors.  I am in awe of her talent, she brought this story to life for me.  A real clincher, read it on a cold and snowy night with a hot cup of chocolate...but keep a notepad for your suspects and make sure you haven't dismissed anyone before REALLY thinking about it....  :)<br />Tracy Talley~@scovery of yet another body, this time on her land and in her lake.

I liked it never-the-less, but not as much as her other ones.<br />~Maggie Holloway is a fashion photographer and has decided to visit an old friend in Newport, RI when a strange murder happens to another old friend.  The neighborhood is in an uproar over the way it has happened and Maggie notices something odd...something too weird to be ignored.  Something linking itself to an old Victorian custom in burial...<BR>Secrets bigger than the highclass neighborhood can bear are tearing this community apart.  Maggie suddenly finds herself the sole heir of the dead friend's property and also the target of the killer...Can she figure it out before its too late?  Or will she be yet another of the killer's victims...buried...perhaps alive?<br />Like I said, Ms. Clark has done a lot better and this doesn't do her justice.  But I will say I did learn a lot about some facts of Victorian death and the way life was conducted.  Educational in the least even if its not too suspenseful...<br />Tracy Talley~@	2001-12-09

I was a little surprised at how good this book was.  I truly didn't think I would like her work since a friend of mine said she wrote 'corny romances',lol.  I will admit, the humor got a little 'corny' and 'goody-goody' at times, but the romance was genuine.  I liked James a lot and thought he was really sexy and one of the few heroes that you wish you could meet in real life.<br />~Elizabeth Hotchkiss, an orphan and one of four children left ot fend for themselves after their parents deaths must marry someone with money or lose her home and starve.  The only prospect that seems possible is her greedy and lecherous landlord who she detests.  Elizabeth finds a strange little red book sitting on her employer's library shelf called 'How to Marry a Marquis'.  Sorely tempted, she takes it and brings it home to the little shack she and her sisters and brother call home.  Thinking the 'rules' might help her 'snag' someone rich or even comfortable, she follows the 'impossible' rules and even tries them out on her employer's new estate manager!  An attractive man named James Sidwell.<br />James is trying to uncover his Aunt's blackmailer, but in the process he must take on the disguise of a lowly estate manager, because in truth, he is the Marquis of Riverdale.

He agrees to help her find a husband, but also realizes he wants to be that husband.  How can he tell her that the book she is reading has truly 'snagged' herself a real and true Marquis?  Or was it the book?<br />The two find themselves in love and James must decide when to reveal his true identity, or can he?

It should be labeled simply 'Romance'.  I am an avid romance reader, but I was bored with the romance in this one.  The character of Ben English got on my nerves because he was a little too perfect and seemed obsessed with the female lead China.  I never did understand how he fell in love with her just by seeing her one time on the streets and barely that when she was shot.  It moved too fast and he became too much with the 'honey' endearments and 'sweet' words when he didn't even know her.  Throughout the story I was never fully convinced he loved her and wasn't sure when it happened, or if it ever did.  China was a bit unsecure for my taste and trusted him too fast without knowing him.  Considering some wacko was after her and she was being used by everyone in her life, a few sweet words and she was 'in love'.  I just wasn't convinced.<br />~China is pregnant and alone.  She is left homeless and walking the streets after her loser boyfriend takes off with all her money.  She finds herself the victim of a woman's bullet when the woman kills a photographer trying to take a picture of her on the streets.  China Brown is the only witness to the senseless killing and when the woman turns the gun on her she is sure she is dead.  Waking up later in the hospital, she finds her baby dead and a very attentive detective at her side.  How can she live without her baby?<br />Ben English has to track the merciless killer who thought nothing of murdering a man and then a helpless pregnant woman.  He finds a bond with her that he can't explain and wants her to trust him.  Things get touchy when at first they are looking for a man and find out its a woman with long blonde hair that they should be looking for and someone who may have a grudge against a tabloid photographer.  That could be hundreds of people!<br />He must protect the case's only witness, a shattered woman who doesn't want to live.  Is the killer the person they least suspect?

Not a real typical Linda Howard, by that I mean that I associate her books with very wierd twists and really scary killers.  This was a very good story, but did lack the real weird aspects of her other works.  But an enjoyable read that will keep you thinking...<br />~Karen Whitlaw is having a tough year.  A good nurse and person, her mother suddenly dies and she is feeling lost and vulnerable when she gets a call from the New Orleans Police that her estranged father she hasn't seen since she was 13 has been murdered.

Expecting to meet a cold and heartless woman, he is shocked to realize he wants the icy woman named Karen!<BR>Both must keep their heads while they try to uncover truths about the murder and the man behind the homeless vet Karen had written off for almost 14 years!  Who was he...really?  Was he a crazed Vietnam vet living on the streets?  Or was he hiding a treacherous and painful secret that drove him to abandon the family he loved more than life itself?  What was he hiding that would cause someone to hunt a homeless man down like an animal and murder him?  When the two find the truths behind the man and his deep secrets they find themselves targets...Karen also finds the love she never lost for the man she called father and must heal.<br />Tracy Talley~@	2001-12-09

This book got a lot of great reviews, but I found it lacking.  The romance between Cameron and Anna was too contrived and found myself liking the story, but not the romance, which is a moot point because the book is a romance.  I thought the romance was kind of 'corny' and I couldn't warm up to the character of Cameron.  He had no responsibilities and didn't seem to think anything of the fact that he didn't work and he was 35.  Simply put, Anna could've done better.<br />~This is the first book in a trilogy including, 'Rising Tides' and 'Inner Harbor', Cameron's other brothers.  A tale about three brothers, all as different as night and day and all adopted juveniels taken in by a deceased man and woman who showed them true love.  The brothers are called on when the father is dying and he asks them to take care of yet another son, this one is just 9 and lots of trouble.  What the brothers soon find out is that the boy is reputed to be his true son!  Why had he abandoned his only true son when the man obviously loved kids?  Did he hide a seedy secret and past?<br />Anna Spinelli is the case social worker asigned to work with the brothers and to take notes on the boy's (Seth) progress, what she doesn't expect is to fall madly in love with the boy's new brother Cameron.  A wild and troubled man that had been wrung through the 'system' and refuses to see Seth go through the same fate.  She is caught in the whirl of secrets and lies as she tries to help the brothers keep the troubled boy Seth and doesn't know if loving Cameron is helping the situation or hurting it.<br />Tracy Talley~@	2001-12-09

It showed that not all women are beaten everyday and every night by drunken husbands, but some are beaten irregularly and abused mentally as well, but its all the same.  They are all battered women.  This story got to the very heart of the matter and even had the reader feeling sorry for the husband and seeing through the wife's eyes how at times she couldn't help but love him madly and forgives him so many times you have to wonder what will happen.<br />~Robert and Lynn Ferguson are the 'perfect' couple in everyone's eyes, except Lynn's best friend, Josie, a social worker and her husband, Bruce Lehman.  They suspect and know the awful truth that the couple keeps hidden.<br />Robert is a very accomplished businessman with the world at his feet and wants the best for his family.  His two daughters strive for perfection, but cannot seem to live up to the demanding standards.  Lynn tries to keep the peace in the family and has given up her life to please his unreasonable demands because she is convinced she is in love with him and he is just overworked and stressed, he doesn't mean to hit her off and on or push her around when he is feeling irritable.  Don't all husbands get stressed?  She can deal with it...she thinks.  Until one night things get out of control and Lynn must make a heartwrenching decision that will affect her life and the lives of her daughters.<br />Unbelieveable story of love and heartbreak.  I loved this story and how real it was.  Ms. Plain got right under the skin of the characters and made you see them for who they really are.  So much so that you feel sorrow for Robert and wish he could work his rage out so they're 20 year marriage can be saved.  A definate worthwhile read and not what I expected.  It opened my eyes to a different world.  Very educational.<br />Tracy Talley~@	2001-12-04

I truly enjoyed this story, but the normally large amount of suspense Ms. Clark usually throws into her novels is missing here.  I did enjoy it though and thought it was really different from most of her tales.<br />~When Adam Cauliff's cabin cruiser blows up in the New York harbor and kills him and several of his close business associates, his distraught wife Nell McDermott is left to pick up the pieces.  Nell is wracked with guilt over a  fight the night before and cannot seem to get over it.<br />As the investigation into the explosion proceeds, Nell finds out more than she wants to about her husband's company dealings and the idea that this was prehaps not an accident that the boat blew up afterall.  She begins to recieve disturbing messages from Adam via a medium and she tries to beat the clock to find the killer, what she doesn't know is that she is being watched very closely.  When she gets too close to the truth, Nell finds herself in shock when faced with the ruthless killer bent on shutting her up for good.<br />The identity of the killer was a little bit of a surprise to me, but it was appropriate considering the facts that are revealed.  I did like this story a lot, but I wished it had more suspense instead of so much investigating into the explosion with all the politics involved.<br />Tracy Talley~@	2001-12-04

I think Ms Henley is changing her writing a little, the style is a bit different than before.  Even her last one 'The Marriage Prize' was also similar in style.  The new ones, ie., this one, is not as exciting or action-packed as her older ones.  I enjoyed curling up with her older books with all the action and excitement going on and just the right amount of romance mixed in!  I liked the hero in this and I also liked the heroine, they were both very strong characters, typical of a Henley novel.<br />~Raven Carleton is a very proper English lady and hopes to marry a proper English gentleman, but on a sunny morning, with the birds singing and the wind flying through her black hair as she gallops at breakneck speed along the seacoast, she isn't thinking about her betrothal to an aristicratic Englishman named Christoper Dacre.  Suddenly she is forced to pull rein tightly on her precious horse's reins to avoid running down a man standing in the direct path of her horse!  A darkly powerful man who will alter her life forever.<br />Heath Kennedy is a diehard and loyal Scot who will defend to the death his homeland and those he loves.  After barely escaping his own death at the hands of men hired to do away with him, he wakes up on the banks of River Eden and sees a beautiful ravenhaired woman riding hell-for-leather along the coast.  Seeing her, he devises a plan that will teach his enemy a lesson he will soon never forget, a ransom for the wild beauty, a bargaining chip.<br />Heath soon realizes too late that his heart is caught in the middle of this political game and he will do anything to save Raven from being used as the bait.  At a time when England is reeling with treason and highborn ladies and gentleman are involved, Heath must convince Raven that he truly cares for her and that she is making a huge mistake by marrying the enemy.  Can the two find love and can Raven dismiss the fact that the man she falls in love with is a hated Scot?<br />Not what a hoped for, but it was definately worth the time and money.

I thought I was in for some real suspense and good romance, but I was shocked to find myself wishing it would end.  the suspense is mediocre and the romance is cliche at best.<br />~Beatrice Poole, a 30 year old widow and a vicar's daughter writes 'horrid novels' under a different pen name and is fasinated with the darker side of passion.  She is very successful and wishes she too could experience something as exciting as what she writes.  When her beloved uncle is found dead, she gets her wish, so to speak.  She is now on the run to find her uncle's killer and what he was hiding.<br />Beatrice calls on the 'mad monk' of Monkcrest, Leo Drake.  He would know how to help her since he was known for his dabbling of the 'dark life'. Leo soon realizes they aren't simply looking for a killer, but they are being hunted down and the reason is an ancient artifact that everyone seems to be after.<br />I wish it hadn't been so boring, but it did get good reviews in general, so I might have missed what everyone else saw.<br />Tracy Talley~@	2001-12-01

Ford is on a secret mission with the Navy SEALS and has no time to waste playing 'Mr. Pinup', but his mind is soon changed when the government orders him to participate in anything and everything Ms. Carly Sullivan asks of him, because SHE is his mission.<br />Carly is a no-nonsense woman with no time to play games or to stop and smell the roses.  She is on a serious deadline and needs a replacement model ASAP or she will lose the account!  Soon she spots a gorgeous man swimming in the deck pool and she knows instantly HE is the ONE!  When she asks him however he misunderstands her intentions and they get off on the wrong foot!

Ford finds his mission to protect her becomes personal and his hardened heart and busy life just took on another obstacle when he lets her in.  This is a definate beach book and lots of fun!  A quick read and worth the time.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the heroine could've been less annoying and not so much baggage to sift through in order to know her.

I liked the fact that the author had the main character of Quinn have a close friend that was a woman, when most romance novels focus on the hate between two women instead of the joy and friendship.  I also liked the male lead better in this book than her other one &quot;Tell Me Lies&quot;.  he was more real and believeable.<br />~Quinn McKenzie is tired of her boring life and her boring boyfriend.  She is sick and tired of living what she calls a 'beige life' and intends to do something about it before she goes nuts!  But what she finds out is changing her life is not going to be easy.

Can he put his feelings aside in the name of friendship when some guy suddenly starts stalking her peaceful world?

Dragon Lord, Dominic of Pendragon is a sexy hero and I enjoyed this story alot.  The heroine, Rose, is smart and sassy and well deserved of the fierce Dragon that is reknown throughout England as one of the King's Champions and best knights.  Lots of steamy romance and political intrigue to keep you reading for hours!<br />~He is reknown for his prowess in the bedroom and in the battlefield.  Also the king's champion, Lord Dragon of Pendragon has newly aquired Ayrdale, a castle estate up on the waring Scottish border by the king's decree as a 'gift'; King John Lackland.  In honor of his bravery and skills, the king has bestowed the estate to him, a landless knight, and also the right to pick his bride from the three women living on the estate.<br />A new widow, and two daughters, he must choose from.  He has no desire to wed anyone but the woman he loves, a widow named Veronica.  But he must obey his king, so he goes to the estate and finds himself in shock.  The sisters are twins!  Identical!  One is sweet and quiet, while the other is a high-spirited hellion named Rose.  Dominic is horrified.<br />Rose has no desire to let her gentile sister waste her life away with the barbarian, so she concocts a devious plan that will undoubtably infuriate Lord Dragon.  Rose knew she could handle the hard edged man who looked like he could kill her in one blow, she had to, she had to save her sister from a fate worse than death and her mother was grieving, she shouldn't have to endure the horrible man's touch!<br />What Rose and Dominic find in each other is no simple marriage of convienence, but a true love that can know no bounds.  With the king's anger waring amoung the barons and the country ready to erupt in a civil war, Dragon must try and find where his loyalty lies...with the hated king, or with Rose and the barons around him.  Can Rose forgive his involvment in her father's death?  Can the two make it work with the country in upheaval?  A great tale not to be missed, as usual, Ms. Mason delivers a sensual tale of power and romance with the right dash of history.<br />Tracy Talley ~@try in upheaval?

I was recommended this book for something funny and dashed with some suspense.  It was okay,definately quirky.  It was very slow at the beginning, but it did pick up near the middle enough to keep me reading.  The humor was good and well done, but just didn't get me going like I thought it would.  I can't put my finger on the problem.  The suspense was okay, but not really convincing.  All in all it was a satisfying read and I did pick up her other book to try her again, but this one just didn't grab me as I thought it would, considering the reviews.<br />~Maddie Faraday's life would be perfect, if it weren't for a few minor problems ... her cheating husband was cheating AGAIN ... her suspicious daughter was listening on her phone conversations...her mother was the town gossip...her best friend of 30 or more years was keeping something secret and now the guy she had lost her virginity to almost 20 years ago has come blazing into town again.<br />The tiny town of Frog Point, a quiet, quaint and nosey small town in rural Ohio had the normal gossip, but now a shocking murder has happened and the town's is buzzing!  Can Maddie's life get any worse?  Yes, she could be accused of the murder for one thing, she can run out of chocolate and her first love from 20 years ago can come knocking!  How had her 'normal' life gone so wrong in just 3 weeks?<br />A fun tale of how a woman betrayed finds love and laughter again and the bonding of two women are everything.  Maddie needs to drop the 'goodgirl' facade and find her 'badgirl' lurking inside, can the old flame help her find it and also help her straighten out her messy life in the process?  Or will brownies do the trick?  There are many laugh-out-loud moments, but I found the story too thin.  I can't put my finger on where exactly I lost interest, but it started near the beginning.  Ms. Crusie did a great job and it shows, it just wasn't what I expected, but certainly an entertaining book.  <br />Tracy Talley~@	2001-11-22

I wish I could rate this with 10 or more stars, but I can't :(  I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a book as much as I enjoyed this one!  Over 400 pages and had it done in close to 8 hours, I could NOT put it down!  The characters jumped off the pages and the terror was so real I felt chills race down my spine!  The humor was one of the best parts and kept you distracted enough to gasp when the terror jumped in.<br />~Jaine Bright and her three best friends all meet every Friday night at the local bar and grill to girl-talk after work.  One night in particular they meet up and begin talking about what would make the 'perfect man.'  A conversation ensues, part joke, part serious until they have composed a humorous list of attributes &quot;Mr. Perfect&quot; should have.  The next day they forget about the 'list' and are shocked to find out that their list has been printed in the workplace newsletter and starts to show up in emails, on t.v. and even the radio!  The women are in shock!  What begins as a harmless joke turns deadly when all the women begin receiving threatening phone calls from someone who is disguising their voice and then one of the four is brutally murdered.<br />Completely in shock, Jaine turns to her unpredictable and unruly neighbor, a cop whom she has just met, not in good graces either for help.  Sam (the neighbor cop) thinks its just a weird coincedence until the htreatys and evidence startys to build to a frightening frenzy and he realizes his beautiful, but very aggrivating neighbor Jaine, is in serious danger from some crazy killer bent on shutting her and her 'list' friends up for good!<br />The tension and suspense is unbelievable!  I honestly did not guess the killer's identity at all and was in shock at the end!  The humorous parts were hysterical when Jaine tries to get along with the neighbor at first when she thinks he is some drunken druglord and completely rude and he thinks she is some dumb twit come to drive him insane!  I must say, the kitchen window scene is the best and will have you in tears!  The suspense and terror is very real and I found myself cringing and my heart racing on many parts.

This is my second book from this author and I am still impressed by her layered plots and how she twists them so much that you really are left wondering who the killer is.  Usually you guess the killer or badguy early on, but now here.  Her characters are filled with life and seem so real you probably would know them had they been your friends!  This wasn't as frightening as my first one by her called &quot;Mr. Perfect,&quot; but it was still great!<br />A very talented painter named Sweeney has achieved what few do at her age of 31.  She has achieved renown success in the art field and has made herself a comfortable sum along the way.  She sells and displays her work at the upscale New York City gallery with her only friend and gallery director.  Her life couldn't be better, or could it?<BR>What she doesn't tell her friend is that she seems to mysteriously wake in the wee hours of the morning and paints vivid and horrifying scenes of mayhem and murder without remembering!  The latest, a disturbing and gruesome murder scene that happens right after she paints scares her into revealing it to a trusted friend and lover. The information gets to the police investigating the murder and she is thrust into the limelight as the prime suspect!  <br />  How did she know the murder before it happened?  Why was she always seeing things no one else could see?  Can Sweeney save herself before the real killer tries to silence her for good?  Breathtaking!  Ms. Howard has a knack for making your skin crawl with the suspense and terror the characters feel!  The romance is very real too and mixes well with the story unlike a lot of suspense/romance books.  Riveting, sexy and creepy!  A sure keeper!<br />Tracy Talley~@	2001-11-19

I am a diehard romance reader and thought that a romance/suspense would whet my appetite, but this story didn't do the job that well.  The suspense was awesome and does keep you guessing till the end but the somewhat 'corny' romance got in the way of an excellent plot of a woman being terrorized by a crazed stalker...<br />~An unusually snowy December in Manhattan keeps most of the city's dwellers inside the comforts of their cozy apartments, but not the man who wants a bestselling mystery author dead.  He prowls the streets, anxiously waiting or his moment to catch her alone.  To show her how much he hates her.  How much she has ruined hs life.

She is afraid for she has been recieving deranged letters from a crazed fan for almost 6 months, but the latest one bears a grim warning, she needs to tell the police before he finds her.<br />A horrible event forces her to hire an ex-cop, 'Mac' McKee, her best friend's brother and her personal antagonist for the past years as her personal bodyguard.<br />With his protection she begins to feel safe once again, but when two more victims are found brutally murdered, each bearing a unique resemblance to Caitlin, they realize that SHE is the ultimate target and the crazed killer is now coming to claim his final victim!<br />Can Mac save Caitlin from the man who despises her?  Will he lose his heart to her in the process?  A true thriller that will keep you guessing and the end is a shock...<br />I liked Caitlin, she was strong and witty, but Mac needs some work.  He didn't hold my interest and his character wasn't developed well enough for me to believe his affection for her.  The romance between the two was bland and kind of 'corny'.  Too much 'mush' when there should've been resistence between them.  I say this because throughout the beginning, we are led to believe that these two irritate one another and are attracted to each other at the same time.

Not good, lol.  The end left too many strings left untied and I felt like it was done without ever explaining what happened to the key people involved.<br />~Sloan Reynolds, a dedicated detective from Bell Harbor, Florida is summoned to meet her abesentee father and sister in Palm Beach.  Her father, a rich and privileged man hasn't seen or spoken to his other daughter since she was a baby.  He has had a heart attack and has called on her to meet him and her sister Paris, but Sloan wants nothing to do with the man who abandoned her and her mother so many years ago.<br />Sloan's mind his changed when an FBI agent named Paul Richardson informs her he needs her to infiltrate her father's home with him as her 'boyfriend' so he can gather the needed evidence to prove her father, Carter Reynolds is involved in fraud, conspiracy, and murder.<br />Sloan is right on the mark until she meets her father's neighbor, Noah Maitland, a very powerful multinational corporate player and one of the FBI's top suspects!  She is hopelessly attracted to the tall, dark and handsome playboy, but she has a job to do.  Can her heart seperate her love for him or will it be her and his downfall?<br />In a complicated web of deceit and passion and hope and fear, can Sloan help the FBI find the players involved and still keep her heart intact, or will the web uncover so much pain and lies that she will run...<br />I was under the impression this was more of a suspense/romance, but it isn't and soon the little suspense that is sprinkled inbetween the story becomes lost amoung the flailing romance between Sloan and Noah.

This is the first time I have had he pleasure of reading this relatively new author's work.  I am a huge fan of Sandra Hill, Dara Joy and Julie Garwood, all humorous writers and I must say that Kinley MacGregor is on my list now!  Her humor is just what I search endlessly for in a romance novel and have a hard time finding.  Only a few authors measure up to par and she is not to be missed!!!<br />~The dreaded Sea Wolf, he stops English navy ships and frees impressed American sailors.  He is a true patriot, revered by so many Americans when America is so new and full of fire.  But few know Morgan Drake's name and identity and even fewer know of is dark past...until a determined and very nosy reporter named Serenity James writes an article that seems to have sealed his fate.  So he set sail for Savannah, and to find the nosy reporter known as S.S. James.  Morgan would set HIM straight...<br />Serenity has longed for adventure all her life, but as a woman, she is lucky enough to have been given the chance to try at her dream of becoming a writer when her father gives her a job at the newspaper.  No women wrote, much less read in 1793, so why was she any different?  She was an unmarried 24 year old spinster, but she didn't care.  Her idol was none other than early feminist, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and her father is horrified!  She should be inside sewing and giggling like an idiot!  Not for Serenity James!  She wanted independance and notariety and to be an equal!  She also longed for a life packed with romance and adventure, but that would never happen...until the day she finds herself kidnapped by a sexy and bold pirate, the very pirate who she wrote about!  Her hero!  Who could ask for anything more?!<br />The Sea Wolf, a noble and brave patriot kidnaping HER, a 24 year old spinster who reads and writes like a man!  This could not happen in her wildest dreams!  Soon she begins to hound him for an interview and sparks fly when these two get together!<br />I loved this funny and romantic tale of mistaken Fate and a pirate whose dark past leaves him feeling hopeless until a brave and bold woman sweeps in and saves him.  Some of the scenes in this book left me laughing into tears!  I am an avid reader of pirate romance, but this has to be one the BEST I have come across! A pirate who is funny and sexy!  What a breathtaking combo!<br />This book was written before MASTER OF SEDUCTION, but in all fairness, A PIRATE OF HER OWN is the sequel to MASTER OF SEDUCTION.  Confusing, I know, but you can read them in any order and they won't leave you perplexed.  Don't miss them!<br />Tracy Talley~@is funny and romantic tale of mistaken Fate and a pirate whose dark past leaves him feeling hopeless until a brave and bold woman sweeps in and saves him.

I am amazed that I was kept on the preverbial 'edge of my seat' with this book!  I read it in 6 hours and could not put it down!  The suspense and twists were enough to make me wince and become anxious!  Unbelievable suspense from what I now refer her to, THE Queen of Suspense, Mary Higgins Clark...<br />~'All Around the Town' is a simple childs rhyme, but not to little four year old Laurie Kenyon.  She has been abducted and held mercilessly for two long and torturous years, suffering abuse and horrible mind games so severe that when she is released at age six, she doesn't even remember what has happened to her!<br />Now at age 21 she is found accused of murdering her English professor, Allan Grant, but she has no memory of the gruesome crime!<br />Apparently during those horrible years of being held prisoner, she has developed multiple personalities, one of which is a sex kitten calling herself \\"Leona\\".  Leona has been writing crazed love letters to Allan Grant and has been secretly entering his home!  She watches him sleep and wishes she could be with him...but the host personality, Laurie, is unaware of the many other 'people' living inside of her.<br />When things seem to go farther downhill for a suffering Laurie, her sister and best friend, a reknowned prosecutor,Sarah, takes up her defense and brings her to a psychiatrist Justin Donnelly, a specalist in MPD, Multiple Personality Disorder.

I read it in 5 hours and could NOT put it down!  I read the trilogy backwards, I started with DREAM MOUNTAIN, which is the second book and I should've started with this one, PARADISE ISLAND.  Either way you read them, they make sense and I cannot wait for the third book to come out in March, SUN VALLEY.<br />~Fame is the furthest thing from Luke's mind.  He has secluded himself on his own private island to work on a secret project that the whole world wants.  He is a reknowned marine archaelogist and much sought after in the press for being devilishly handsome and extremely smart.  His island, Paradise Island, not many know about, its not even on most maps, this is why he is so shocked when a raft washes ashore with a barey dressed woman inside!  Who in the world is she?  Is she another of the hoards of women who try endlessly to seduce him for publcity?<br />Who is she?  She can't even remember that much.  She must have amnesia.  Why is she washed ashore in some raft wearing close to nothing?  Why does she feel this deep down sense of dread and fear?  Someone is trying to kill her...why?  Why can't she remember?  And why is this handsome guy that has found her think she is some groupie out to seduce him?  Maybe he is some maniac hermit!  Maybe he is the person she is running from!<br />Luke soon names her Jade, after the ring she is wearing.  Luke does't trust her, but he is hopelessly attracted to her.  Maybe she isn't lying.  Maybe she IS some amnesiac...but who cant be sure?  He can't take any chances with the information he has.  He needs to safeguard his project.<br />In a world of corruptness and greed, Jade must remember who she is and why she is being hunted or she will die.  Can she trust Luke?  Was he somehow involved in her nightmare?  Would her falling in love with him effect this whole mess?<br />This is one action-packed romance with twists that leave you turning the pages rapidly for more!  I rarely find a romance that has action and twists that I find so absorbing that I can't put it down, but this is one of them, including the second to this trilogy, DREAM MOUNTAIN.  Gena Hale is a new author to the romance genre and I think she has made an impression that will launch her into success quickly!  She is also known as Sheila Veihl in another genre.<br />Tracy Talley~@action and twists that I find so absorbing that I can't put it down, but this is one of them, including the second to this trilogy, DREAM MOUNTAIN.

We got to read Miles' story and got to know him.  He was kinda aloof in the previous 3 books and it was nice to find out he is just as sexy and interesting as his brothers!  The added mystery and chivalry that Miles possesed made him a very likable character to me.  Miles' story is a little different than the others, he has to try and settle the bloody fued between his family the Montgomerys and the enemy, the Chatworths.  How you might ask?  He finds himself hopelessly attracted to the Chatworth sister, Elizabeth...<br />She was delivered to him rolled in a carpet, naked and looking like an angel sent from Heaven.  Miles is confused on who she is as she stares at him with her deep emerald eyes and long honey blonde hair, maybe she IS an angel...until she comes at him with an axe of course...<br />Elizabeth is being used as a pawn in a deadly game between waring families and enemies.  She vows to not surrender herself or her pride.  She finds herself a captive of the most notorious of the Montgomery brothers, Miles.  He is reputed to use women mercilessly and throw them aside.  Getting them pregnant with his children for fun.  She hated the Montgomery's...she despised them!  They were the cause of her family's problems!  They caused her poor sister-in-law to go mad!  She was a Chatworth!  The fierce hatred between these two waring familes has caused the king to become angry!<br />In a haze of murder, rape and betrayal, Miles and Elizabeth find themselves caught in the middle as their own hearts are torn.  She wants him, yet she fears him and hates what he is...but can she tell her heart the same?  Is her own family the cause of the problems?  Can she learn to love a Montgomery?  Can Miles learn not to hate?  Can past brutalities fade enough to let love in?  Can these two lost hearts end a raging fued that has lasted far too long before the king banishes them all?<br />A nonstop action/adventure/romance!  A wonderful ending to the series!  We get to meet up with past characters from the previous books, Judith &amp; Gavin, Stephen &amp; Bronwyn, Raine &amp; Alyx and the many secondary characters that I have grown to love.

I have to admit I was a little disapointed.  I expected something better in my opinion.  Not to say it wasn't good by any means, it was, but I loved Raine in the two previous books, VELVeT PROMISE and HIGHLAND VELVET, but this one VELVET SONG didn't quite reach that level that the other two did.<br />Not as much action or adventure as the previous two and the heroine I felt a little distant from.  Almost like I didn't get the chance to know her.  Raine was more cold and unforgiving in this one also, compared to his forgiving nature in the previous books.  There is a very good reason for it, but I just missed the fun-loving nature he had before.<br />Alyx Blackett's father was murdered in the night and their house was burned to the ground, she had no choice but to flee in the darkness from a man who wanted to see her burned at the stake.  She flees to the outlaw camp of Raine Montgomery, a nobleman outlawed by the king in the previous book HIGHLAND VELVET. (I won't say why because it will ruin the plot to the previous book :)  There she hides in disguise as his squire and a boy.<br />Alyx soon finds herself helplessly attracted to the nobleman, as much as that is detestable to her, for noblemen are the cause of her grief and running.  She doesn't know how long she can pretend to be a boy when her body wants him to touch her!  But why would he want her?  A poor man's daughter, a serf?  He would never look her way, not when he has flocks of gorgeous women at his beck and call!  But can she lure him to her?  With he unique and angel's voice?<br />Raine Montgomery is preparing for a blood bath with the hated Chatworths, the Montgomery's most hated enemy!  His heart is filled with rage for what they have done now and he will see it to the finish!  His family has been torn apart by their brutality and jealousy!  This bloody feud has been raging for a long time...murder, rape...Raine is determined to stop i all any cost!  But will the love of a poor serf change his heart?  Can her song lift the hearts of the Montgomery's and find pity from the king?  Does love rule all?

I was told by a few people that I might not like this installment of the Velvet books, but on the contrary, I absolutely LOVED LOVED it!  The heroine's strong character and stubborness captivated me!  I loved her spririt!  I in no way saw Stephen Montgomery as weak in this story!  He was a man truly and madly in love with a stubborn and willful woman who has held past hatreds deep in her heart and finds it difficult to trust anyone English.<br />Soon after Stephen's summons to marry a Scottish Laird named Bronwyn MacArran by King Henry, he invisions a horrible woman with claws and an ugliness so fierce she would scare him just by looking his way, what he encounters is a much, much different vison worth fighting for...clear blue eyes and hair the color of midnight...so breathtaking she makes him forget who he is.<br />Bronwyn is not under ANY circumstances a weak woman or meek in any form.  She is the leader of a powerful clan.  She fears nothing and no one, even her most hated enemy, the MacGregors.  She will not bend to the will of any man, including some English sop like Stephen Montgomery.  She too is shocked by his handsome face and seemingly sweet personality, but she must not be fooled into thinking he is anything other than a murdering Englishman, the same race that murdered her father and her men from the clan not too long ago.  She only agrees to marry him in order to save bloodshed amoung her people and the English, but she will never become a loving wife to the horrible Englishman even though he makes her knees weak and her skin tingle when he looks her way with his devilish smile.<br />A battle of wills begins, more fierce than that of the battle raging between the two clans fueding.  Can Bronwyn prove to herself and her clan that she is a worthy laird?  Will Stephen gain the trust and admiration of her clan?  Will he abandon his English ways for her?  Does he love her?  Can she love him enough to look past his race?<br />A truly touching love story of a will so strong that it takes a very determined and strong man to show Bronwyn that not all men are alike and that he loves her with all his heart.  He will give up his life and identity for her, just to see her smile for him.  I could not help but love Stephen and I truly loved Bronwyn.  A very realistic view of how the Scots felt towards the English and how a woman laird with so much hate can try and overcome her misgivings.<br />The story is filled with history, action, adventure, villians, love and even humor!  For example, one of the funniest parts in the book was when Bronwyn tried to stop Stephen from getting involved in the clans quarrels and said to him, &quot;He hates the English more than I do!&quot;  and he responds, &quot;That's impossible.&quot;  Stephen proves worthy of any Scotswoman and even to become a noble and fierce Scotsman.  I highly recommend this book, even with some of the bad reviews it has recieved.  I simply loved it and could not help myself!  Very hard to put down!  If you love very very strong willed heroines and men who will not give up them for the world, then you will like this book!  It was also nice to meet up with the other brothers, Gavin and Raine and Miles.  We meet up with Judith also,Gavin's wife, from the first book, VELVET PROMISE.  I think I have to admit, this might very well become my favorite of the series, but we'll see, I need to start the third book now about Raine called VELVET SONG and finish with the last story about Miles called VELVET ANGEL.  You can't help but love the Montgomery men!  Especially Stephen!  Wow!

When I bought this book I was a little skeptical whether or not it was worth the money.  I have read numerous books on dieting, ect and I never really understood what they were trying to teach, but this one really hit the nail on the head, so to speak.<br />It shows you how to cut back safely and how not to cut too much and why.  It also explains in easy terms why your body works a certain way and how to obtain what you want.  For example, it explains how many calories you would need to cut back to lose X amount of weight in X amount of time.  It has information on weight groups, the food pyramid, healthy weights and even a section in the back with foods listed and how many calories and fat they contain.  So far I have been following the suggestions and have lost just about 40 pounds so I would definately say its worth the money!  Its not hard to stick to (believe me, I HATE dieting) and you don't feel hungry all the time.  It shows you how to start eating right and how to indulge when you crave.  Its definately not a diehard-drop-the-weight-now book in any means.  Learning how to eat right and how to eat your favorite foods and how to learn when to say when.  I have since learned how to eat better and how your body sends signals when its full, truly full, and when its really hungry and not just craving that piece of cake you were eyeing.  LOL...  A way to finally lose the weight and how to maintain it is what I was looking for without pills and fad diets,and this is the book.  Definately not a book for 'dummies'...<br />Tracy Talley~@	2001-10-20

I was completely entralled with this love story of passion, greed, murder and true love... <br />It all begins with a knight, Gavin Montgomery who has vast riches, but long ago a king disbanded much of the family's lands and money in jealousy.  Not many noblewomen want to marry into this family because of this, but one man has pleaded with Gavin to marry his daughter, Judith Revedoune.  Her father is an earl and his lands are coveted and much sought after.  Joining the two would join the vast and rich lands he is dying for.  Gavin agrees, seeing the prospect of the riches and the union at first seems a good one until Judith's temper and independant personality overcomes Gavin's domineering one.<br />The battle of the wills begins and the two are forced to face their own demons.  Soon Judith finds herself in love with the handsome knight, but someone in his past is trying to tear them apart and she refuses to admit her love; his heart had belonged to another for a long time.  Can Judith's reknowned beauty and kindness capture Gavin's heart, or will he continue to be entanced by a beautiful witch bent on claiming him as her own?<br />The action and intrique is amazing!  I was completely in awe of this story and couldn't put it down!  Another Amazon reviewer recommended it to me and I finally picked it up, Abbys, and I am so glad I did!  To think I went all this time without reading this wonderful book and missed out on a great adventure!  I am now excited to read the other 3 books in this series, HIGHLAND VELVET, VELVET SONG &amp; VELVET ANGEL.  These are the tales of Gavin's brothers.  Judith is now one of my all-time favorite heronies!  She is way ahead of her time and gives Gavin a run for his money!!!  A sure keeper! This is my first book by Jude Deveraux and definately NOT my last!!!  Thank-you again Abbys for recommending this series to me!  Its a godsend!!!  :-)<br />Tracy Talley~@	2001-10-18

I didn't think I would be that interested in such a concept as sci-fi/romance with a little gender role reversal thrown in, but wow was I in store for a surprise!<br />~Green Tamryn is a Marquelle, equal to what a Duke is in England on a far off planet ruled by women and where men are considered second-class citizens and are used in political gain.  They are sold off by their mothers to the highest bidder(a high noblewoman)of the Top Slice. (this is equal to Dukes and Lords in England) She never wanted to fasten(marry) but an evil woman with treacherous plans had made her think again.  Green must fasten with the most sought after male in Capital Town, Jorlan Rynard.  <BR>Jorlan is a powerful woman's son.  He is spoiled and pampered, and does not want to be fastened.  He has ideals and hopes that someday men will be viewed as equals and tries to push his views but his old fashioned grandmother is aghast.  In the blink of an eye he finds himself fastened to one of the Top Slice's most powerful women, a woman about 10 years older than he and much more experienced in the bedroom that he ever imagined.  He is afraid he will never find his own in the woman ruled world and refuses to bend to Green's will.<BR>Green is being hounded by her enemy and her enemy wants Jorlan.  Green refuses to let the greedy woman have the only man she ever wanted.  Soon Green and Jorlan find themselves answering to the She-Lords for a conspiracy that Green's worst enemy has plotted, the Ritual of Proof.<BR>This story is so vivid and compelling I found it extremely hard to stop reading!  I read it in one day!  The role reversal was so different and unique I could hardly believe how well Ms. Joy pulled it off so believably!  Where men are valued for their bed-price and the their veils(virginity) is a must, this tale is fasinating to say the least.  I highly recommend this for something very exotic and different!<br />Tracy Talley~@	2001-10-17

This is the second book in the Delaney brother's trilogy, including in order, &quot;To Love A Stranger&quot;, &quot;To Tame A Renagade&quot; and &quot;To Tempt A Rogue&quot;.  This was very tenderhearted and very sweet, comparing it to the first one about the eldest brother Pierce in TO LOVE A STRANGER.<br />Chad Delaney is on the run from his past, a dark and forbidding one that he can't seem to shake no matter how hard he tries.  He hasn't seen his two brothers Pierce and Ryan in over two long and lonely years as he hunts men down for money as a bounty hunter.  During one of these jobs he tracks a notorious bank robber into the tiny town of Carbon, Wyoming.  But as soon as Chad has arrived, the outlaw had fled and so has his family.  Irritated, Chad decides to ask around town to see if anyone has seen him when he runs into a bedraggled boy on the streets being beaten and teased by nasty bullies.  Deciding he couldn't stand there and let the boys beat on the poor helpless boy, Chad helps him.  Which turns out to be a big mistake when he takes the boy home, a shantytown right on the outskirts of Carbon.  A filthy and poor section where people,lives worse than animals.<br />Sarah Temple is in no mood for an illtempered bounty hunter coming to her door bringing her little boy, beaten and scared.  She distrusts all men and looks upon Chad's handsome face with nothing but loathing.  In the heated exchange that follows, Sarah suffers an accident and Chad feels responsible.  Now Chad is finding himself helping the poor woman more than he ever intended.  He wants to leave her behind and continue on with his own life but his almost forgotten concience compells him to stay and help her.<br />The longer Chad stays to help her, the more he finds out about the single mother and the way she lives.  Is she connected to the very outlaw he is hunting?  Will her life change his in the blink of an eye?  Does he want it to?  Can he trust himself if he becomes besotted with yet another destressed woman?  Can his heart and soul manage the pain again?  Chad soon learns that Fate has already made plans for him whether he is ready to face his demons or not...<br />We meet up again with all the Delaneys and we get to catch up again with the characters from the first book TO LOVE A STRANGER with Pierce and Zoey Delaney and Pierce and Chad's younger and very rogueish brother Ryan.  The story is filled with non-stop action and tender scenes between an emotionless Chad trying to find his heart once again and an abandoned young woman trying to raise a little boy on nothing but scraps of food and torn clothing.

Sierra Alden is desperate to find her long-lost brother and sister seperated from her when an Indian attack left her parents murdered and her wandering alone on the Colorado prairie.  So 18 years later when she is fresh from finishing school and living with her adopted parents in California she overhears a tale of two white 'savages' who were adopted and grew up in a Cheyenne tribe and were now living in 'polite society' in Denver.

Ram meets Sierra in an unfortunate way and they both loathe each other immediately.  Soon afterwards Ramsey gets an urgent telegram for him to proceed to Denver ASAP.  Overhearing this, Sierra decides to hitch a ride with him, but he forbids it.  Little does he know he can;t stop the stubborn and spoiled rich girl who always gets her way.<br />As always Connie Mason takes us on an unforgettable journey through the mountains packed full of adventure and intrigue.

I wish the ratings had the option of 41/2 stars, but they don't.  I thought this was an extremely fast-paced adventure chalked full of villians and similar to 'Romancing the Stone' with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner from the 1980's.<br />Max is an ex-patriot on the run in Mexico's most dangerous sections of the jungle.  He carjacks a woman named Lori Harding while she is on a much-needed vacation in Cancun.  Lori hasn't been on a vacation in years due to her constant care of her ailing mother, when she dies, she leaves money to her two daughters and Lori uses some of it to travel.  Little does the prim school-teacher know that her proper and controlled life is about to be turned upside down!  Lori is dangerously attracted to the carjacker's muscular body, but chastizes herself for such &quot;ditzy&quot; thoughts and has a hard time trying to control her thoughts and feelings.  Max is also dangerously attracted to the uptight woman he deems as &quot;a good girl&quot; and very out of his reach.  Max has many deep-rooted problems and he cannot share his life with any woman.  Lori soon finds out why and tries desperately to help him, but he doesn't want her help.<br />The story takes you through the steamy and tropical jungles of Mexico's Montana Mountains, one of the most remote jungles in the world and through the backroads of Mexico's rainforest.  The descriptions were unreal and you felt as though you were there with Max and Lori.  This tale teems with excitement and action and never stops!  This should be a movie!  The love that blossoms between them is steamy and heartwreching!  Max is one of those heroes you wish you knew and Lori is someone you can connect to on a realistic level.  If you're looking for adventure, non-stop action, running, hiding, druglords, and a little taste of 'Romancing the Stone', this is it!  I loved it and couldn't put it down!  This book restored my faith in Karen Robards.  The only other book I read by her was &quot;Island Flame&quot; and I was dissapointed, but I decided to try again with this book, &quot;Wild Orchids&quot; and I was pleased.  This is definately a keeper!!!uot; and I was dissapointed, but I decided to try again with this book, &quot;Wild Orchids&quot; and I was pleased.  This is definately a keeper!!!	2001-10-04

First off, I try to be VERY objective when I read anything and try my absolute BEST to be fair in my criticism, but this book was unbelieveable.  I mean it in the sense that I was appalled with the hero.  Anthony was extremely abusive and horrible to Cassie(the heroine) throughout the entire book.  First of all his has some weird obsession with her mother who had died and transfers it to Cassie(the daughter) and kidnaps her and begins to abuse and rape her non-stop.  I never really understood the problems Anthony had to make him the way he was except it had to do with something with her mother in the past.  After at least 100 rapes or more later, Cassie finds herself falling in love with Anthony and I guess she accepts there is nothing the matter with how he treats her.  He in turn falls in love or is still obsessed with her, which I believe the latter is more truer, and convinces her to stay with him.  I think anyone who is about to read this novel should be forwarned of the brutal content and make sure you are prepared for the violent scenes.  The second book to this is &quot;Devil's Daughter&quot;, it is about their daughter and son.	2001-10-04

Sandra Hill is by far my favorite author.  She blends a perfect dash of humor with romance and adventure.  She didn't dissapoint in this funny tale of a lawyer known as the 'Swamp Solicitor' in Southern Louisiana named Luc LeDeux who walks into a chemist's lab to have a sample tested and accidentally consumes a handful of the chemist's 'love potion' in the form of jelly beans!<br />The chemist, Dr. Sylvie Fontaine has been working hard on the love potion and hasn't yet had it tested on humans when Luc comes in and eats her potion!  What to do?!  Well first of all, she is horrified it was taken by the well-known 'bay-boy-of-the-bayou' and the fact that test trails have only been done on rats!  Luc is already a walking mix of testosterone and male ego when he takes the potion he is more than straight-laced Sylvie can handle.  I was laughing so hard with the things that happen between them and how she tries hard to keep track of his feelings on a notepad and how she asks him the most personal questions to find out how well her potion is working!  Will the potion cause them to fall in love or will it fade away?  Is someone trying to steal the potion?  This book will keep you turning the pages to find out and along the way, you meet some very funny characters including Luc's wily aunt Lulu who can't stop meddling into his love life, his two nosey brothers and his sister who thinks everyone ought to have 'pouf' in their hair.  This is a sure pleaser and right along track with Ms Hill's usual flair and wit.  The love scenes are HOT with a capital H and what I love most about Ms Hill's female characters are that they are never really gorgeous or beautiful on the outside, just normal, average women with realistic problems.  But her men...ugh, they are ALWAYS gorgeous and sexy!  Makes one wish they were real!  Give this book a try, its well worth the money!  By the way, if you read her other books, namely 'Frankly My Dear...', there is a mention in this book of the characters and places...enjoy  :)mention in this book of the characters and places...enjoy  :)	2001-10-01
US	51968865	R9X26H1OQW0VV	0451202317	819046965	Beyond Eden	Books	2	15	18	N	N	Romance yes, Suspense its not...	This is my second Coulter book and I only read it because I had hoped, no, actually I had prayed that my first book(Devil's Embrace) was a bad example of her work, but this only intensified my opinion of her and I am a little surprised she is a New York Times Best Selling Author. I am not going to get critical of all the flaws in this book, but I will say this, romance it was, but a suspense it was not.<br />The story is a long and drawn out portrayal of a woman who is gone from ugly duckling to supermodel. The blurb on the back of the book states it is about a woman who becomes a model and is being terrified and stalked by some maniac, but who is it? Someone from her past? What is she hiding? I will tell you, nothing...she is hiding nothing,. She is brutally attacked by her sister's husband when she is 18 in France. Her family treats her badly and her father especially hates her. They all blame her for her loser brother-in-law's brutal rape. Lindsey(the heroine) years later becomes a supermodel named Eden. She is popular and is beginning to get on with her life until her sister comes back into it to stir the pot. Somewhere in here (I assume) Coulter was trying to bring some tension and suspense into the story by adding the hero of S.C Taylor, Lindsey's bodyguard. For what, I'm not sure, Coulter never makes that clear either. After some unnecessary chapters where nothing happens but Taylor falling for her, the story gets off-track and you're not sure where the stalker is or if there IS one at all.<br />Taylor must sort through her messy past and try and win her trust, while keeping her meddling family at bay. He succeeds and then by the last 10 pages or so, the stalker is revealed and I was left wondering,....why?<br />This story was lacking in true suspense and it was choppy to the point of not understanding what the plot was. If you like a good romance, this was ok, but I would steer clear if you're looking for a good romantic suspense story, it is poorly written in that department...in that department...	2001-09-28

This is the follow-up to Garwood's masterpeice 'Heartbreaker' that was released last year and I must say I am impressed! This was just as good as the first, perhaps even better! Nick's(from Heartbreaker) brother Theo is attending a conference in New Orleans when he suddenly becomes ill and throws up on a woman who happens to be a doctor. Doctor Michelle Renard, or Mike, as her family calls her is attending a conference when she sees an ill man doubled over by the elevator doors obviously in pain. When she goes to help him, he vomits on her new dress and passes out. Next thing Theo knows is that he is in an operating room with the beautiful woman who had tried to help him by the elevator. Michelle had found Theo in time, his appendix was about to burst. The two are thrown together by a twist of Fate, because Theo is a Federal Attorney and he is being threatened by mob associates and is hiding until the case dies down. He finds himself in the deep swamps of Louisiana in a little known town called Bowen, where the woman who had operated on him happens to work. A crooked group of men calling themselves 'The Sowing Club' and their horrible secret finds its way from the luxurious streets of New Orleans to the poor swamps of Bowen. Now they are after Michelle and Theo. Michelle's normally boring life is being turned upside down as FBI and police try to unravel the secret before someone is killed.<br />The chemistry is great between Theo and Michelle and the scenes with Noah Clayborne (from Heartbreaker) are fantastic! Its a fast paced story that keeps you wondering how the Sowing Club will work and how corrupt they can be. I am not usually a fan of corruption and political gain type stories, but this one was unbelieveable! It should be on the big screen! The love that Theo and Michelle find was magical and all I can say is WOW! Julie Garwood has sure made a niche for herself in the mystery/romance dept. I am not anxiously awaiting the next installment from this intriguing...Make one for Noah!!!<br />  .....Make one for Noah!!!<br />  ...	2001-09-24

This is my very first Garwood book and I must say...WOW are the only words that can describe this well written book. I am in awe of her talent. I am normally not a fan of contemporary romance, but this book definately changed my views on that. This is a perfect mix of romance and suspense, my two favortites types of books all rolled into one masterpiece! This will have you guessing who the \\"Heartbreaker\\" is until the very end! Nick Bucchanan, (the lead male)the FBI agent that is summoned to protect the lead female, Laurant and her brother a priest, from a madman bent on stalking and killing Laurant. Father Tom is listening to confessions one afternoon when a deranged man threatens his sister's life and then leaves without a trace. Tom calls on his best friend and FBI agent Nick to help. Soon Nick realizes they are not dealing with a simple case of obsession, but a serial killer who wants to stalk and mutilate Laurant. Things soon heat up as Nick is to be with her 24 hrs a day in a little town in Iowa called Holy Oaks, where everyone knows one another and their business, but is the killer amoung them? They soon find they are falling in love with one another as they are forced to spend more and more time together to keep Laurant safe, but IS she really safer in Nick's arms than if she wasn't? Its a fast-paced thriller/romance that keeps you guessing who-dunnit until you think you've figured it out and to find that you've no idea! The tension between Nick and Laurant is real and you feel for them and find yourself hoping they survive. Heartbreaker is a sure pleaser and I highly recommend it!

I bought this book, \\"Tempted\\" by a relatively new author, Monica Roberts expecting the same type of laugh-out-loud humor, but it sorely fell short.<BR>The plot sounded as if it would be quite funny, but it never did get off the ground and I found myself wishing the pages were moving faster.<BR>The female lead, No-Account Savage is a mail-order bride from the mountains and goes west to California bringing her brother along. A preacher has sent for her from Coldbottom, California, the heart of the gold country during the California goldrush. He is expecting a perfect wife to go along with his perfect life. What he gets and what he expected are two completely opposite things. This is where it should've taken off and become hysterical, but it just floundered. I kept thinking this or that would happen and it never did, nothing important happened in this simple tale and you quickly become bored with the 'preacher perfect' act and confused when he suddenly falls for her. <BR>Even the villian, if he could be called that, was boring and over in a mere 3 pages. Nothing sparked between these two characters and you were left wondering how the storyline even got this far. I don't want to offend the author, as I myself love to write and it is a difficult thing, but I see this author as becoming better as she goes on, this isn't a fair book to judge her writing skills by. She seemed hampered and not able to express herself as she had wanted, I hope she tries again and becomes better. For those of you that love a humorous romance with laugh-out-loud characters and situations, by all means, try the Queen of romantic comedy, Sandra Hill, you won't be disapointed....	2001-09-16

The sex scenes are very, very erotic and a little racy. I liked the male lead of Hugh. He was very strong and not your typical 'romance book man', what I mean by that is that he was not gorgeous or heart-stopping handsome or cocky. He was a plain and average man with a good heart and soul. He loved Isabelle madly and would do anything for her. The problem I had with Isabelle, or Belle as she is called, is her spoiled and downright uppity attitude towards her mother and Hugh, her husband. In my opinion, Hugh was too good for Belle. But all that aside, the story was about a man named Hugh, a knight who was ordered to marry the lady of Langston Keep to keep the king's brother at bay since his brother Richard of Normandy continued to war with his English brother and King of England, Henry I. Hugh met Belle, or Belle from Hell as they all called her since she was so unruly and rude. Hugh was shocked at first, but soon found himself in love with her and found her spirit making his heart sing. Belle could not believe she had fallen in love with this 'plain-faced' knight. (this is what I meant by her being uppity and rude) She told him even when they married that he was plain and not someone she originally saw herself with, but that she loved him and that's all that mattered. (I myself thought if I were Hugh I would tell her that she was a spoiled brat, but I was not in the story, so...LOL)Anyhow, Hugh was sent away on a mission for the king and soon found himself imprisoned in the clutches of a powerful and evil woman who claimed to be a sorceress named Vivienne. He has forgotten who he is and that he has a wife in England, for he is being held captive in Brittany. Soon Belle goes to find him when he comes up missing for a long time. She finds her beloved enchanted by this sorceress and realizes he does not remember Belle. She is soon also captured by Vivienne's brother Guy, a powerful sorcerer. Belle struggles to free herself and Hugh for the sake of their love that he can't remember...It was an excellent story with many plot twists, but I wasn't convinced Belle truly loved Hugh. I was convinced that he loved her though and found myself wishing he would realize what a brat she was, lol. But in all, it was a 4 star read and I would just warn anyone about the VERY strong sexual content in this story...erself and Hugh for the sake of their love that he can't remember...It was an excellent story with many plot twists, but I wasn't convinced Belle truly loved Hugh.

Thorne the Relentless spots Fiona the Learned in a pool naked on the Isle of Man after he feels a compulsion to go to the island. Immediately he is enchanted and has to have her. He is scared off but returns a year later after suffering a whole year dreaming about her and obsessing about her until he is sure he is bewitched. He is sent to kill the 'witch' on the Isle of Man. He soon finds he can't kill her, he'd rather stop breathing for he feels completely under her siren spell and must have her.<br />Fiona is no witch, she is a healer. Since she was small, her friend and teacher Brann, has told her she will be captured by her future soulmate, a Viking, on a raid. She is appalled and aghast. She isn't sure Brann is correct, but when Thorne shows up and takes her to his homeland. She soons realizes she is indeed his soulmate and can't understand how Thorne will accept this since he firmly believes she is a witch and has cast a spell on him.<br />The history here is excellent and is accurate. You get a real life glimpse into Viking life and how they were. I liked Fiona and Brann, but Thorne quickly got on my nerves. He continuously believes that she is a witch and has cast a spell on him. He also believes EVERYONE else besides Fiona when things happen, even a known murderer and liar. The story kept me turning the pages regardless of how Thorne got on my nerves, lol, Connie Mason is a superb writer and this story is worth the read...<br />Tracy Talley~@	2000-11-27

Soon she finds herself wishing she could go home when a blizzard begins and a 'Santa' shows up at her door who she knocks out thinking he is a maniac.

This is the story of Erik, the eldest son of Thork from the first book called 'The Reluctant Viking'. Erik is 31 and has been married once, he was duped and doesn't intend to make the same mistake twice. Until Eadyth of Hawk's Lair comes to him with a marriage proposal he can't refuse.<br />Eadyth wants nothing to do with men, but she needs a husband to protect her and her 7 year old son John from her most hated enemy. She goes to Erik of Ravenshire for help. Erik shares her hatred for the evil Steven of Gravely. He marries her in name only to protect her and her son in order to get to his enemy. He never intended to fall in love with the 'Tarnished Silver Jewel of Northumbria'.<br />This story was Sandra Hill's usual humorous and sexy romp of romantic history. I loved it immensely. Erik is sexy and funny with the things that happen between them when they are trying NOT to fall in love with one another. Eadyth is a beekeeper and the scrapes that happen are hysterical.<br />One thing Sandra Hill is able to do that not many authors achieve is the use of children and pets in her stories. She makes them secondary characters you grow to love and laugh with. In this particular story you will get a kick out of the wedding 'gift' Tykir, Erik's younger brother and main character to the last book-The Bewitched Viking, gives to Eadyth. I was on the floor laughing. &quot;Show me yer legs...&quot; hahahaha, you will know what I mean when you read it, it is hysterical! <br />The entire Viking Series is excellent! And my favorite character is Tykir....ahhh, he is so sexy and sweet, he will make you melt. His book is last, the 4th in the series after Erik's........1. The Reluctant Viking--2. The Outlaw Viking--3. the Tarnished Lady--4. The Bewitched Viking(my favorite) =) All are 5 star reads, I wish I could rate them higher!<br />Tracy Talley~@	2000-11-16

Here we meet Ruby Jordan and Thork's daughter from the first book (The Reluctant Viking), Thoraine Jordan, or Rain.<br />Rain and her mother go to the famous archeological dig going on at the ancient Coppergate site in England in 1999. Rain sees an intriging painting of a Norse Viking warrior raising his sword against the enemies in a battle known as the &quot;Great Battle&quot; between the Saxons and the Vikings in the tenth century. It is the last battle between the two that resulted in the Saxon rule over the Vikings.<br />Rain is fasinated by the picture and her mother recognizes the man in the painting. The next day, Rain is so intrigued, she goes back to the painting to get a better look and suddenly is swept into the battle raging on in the portrait. Dr. Rain Jordan meets the man from the picture and knows him as Selik, her father's friend. She saves his life on the field, but he doesn't trust her.<br />Selik has been through utter dispair and misery these past 10 years since a terrible atrocity was inflicted upon him and his family. Selik knows nothing but revenge. He was once a proud and vain man, but the ravages of war and the horrible things he has endured have made him a bitter and &quot;ugly&quot; man. Rain knows she was sent back in time to save this desperate man, but will she need someone to save her from him?<br />I loved this story. I liked it more than the first book for the extra humor Sandra Hill is known for and the sexy and irrisistable heroes she creates. It is filled with Viking history and details not found in many historical romances. You can almost smell the city of Jorvik (York) and see the many peoples and things she describes. It is WELL worth the time and money spent on this EXCELLENT book, the whole series is worth more than 5 stars!<br />1. The Reluctant Viking---2. The Outlaw Viking---3. The Tarnished Lady---4.

I have to admit, this isn't as funny as her other books, but I still loved it and thought it was EXCELLENT. The history in this book is outstanding and very accurate. The story is about a woman named Ruby Jordan. It's the year 1994 and her husband Jack of 20 years walks out. Ruby is distraught and confused. She sits back and listens to a tape to calm her emotions when suddenly she wakes up in the 10th century and aboard a Viking ship! Ruby sees a man that looks EXACTLY like Jack, but this man is a powerful Viking with long blonde hair named Thork. He thinks she is a spy sent by his enemy to destroy him and the village. No one believes she is from the future and Ruby tries to convince everyone she is married to Thork in another life, this is when everyone believes she is insane. The story takes us through the turmoil the Vikings went through and shows us they are a fierce and proud people, but also a gentle and loving people. We get to meet the characters from the other books in the series. Although I was upset with Thork's fate, I liked the ending a lot. What happened to him was meant to be and it touches your heart. This is the first book in the Viking Series. Here they are in order---'The Reluctant Viking', 'The Outlaw Viking', 'The Tarnished Lady', and 'The Bewitched Viking'.<br />Tracy Talley~@	2000-11-10

This is the story of Rolfe's(main character from Last Viking) brother, Jorund. Jorund goes on a search to find his brother after he disapeared in the sea off the coast of Iceland. What Jorund finds instead is the killer whale named Thora that takes him against his will to the year 2000. Jorund is a Viking from the year 998. He doesn't realize he has traveled through time and he is now in the 21st century until he is placed in a mental hospital by a doctor Maggie McBride, who he thinks is called Dock-whore Mag-he Muckbride, this is where the story gets funny. Jorund tries to convince Mag-he with &quot;the man-hair&quot; that he is a 10th century Viking, but she thinks he is delusional. Suffice to say the tale gets funnier and more crazy as it goes along until Mag-he with the 'man-hair' and the 'sex-voice' finds herself madly and truly in love with the Viking named Joe(this is her nickname for him). Jorund must find why he was sent to this time and place and why. When Maggie finally realizes he is telling the truth, they must find out why he is there and if he will return to his time. I LOVED this book so much, it was just as funny as the first &quot;The Last Viking&quot;. All of Sandra Hill's books are hysterical and so sizzling hot that you find yourself either saying, &quot;Hahaha, I can't believe he said that!&quot; or &quot;Wow!&quot;. She is an extremely talented writter and she deserves recognition. She is a breath of fresh air to the romance genre. Keep up the superb work Sandra!<br />Tracy Talley~@	2000-11-08

He found himself in a whole different world. This is where he meets up with Meriedith, a tenth century-Viking researcher who works at the college nearby. Rolfe is fasinated at the way things have changed in a thousand years and soon has you rolling on the floor laughing with the things that he does and the things that happen to him and Merry-Death(this is how he pronounces her name) LOL...Sandra Hill is an excellent writer and she is kinda new to me still, but she already my favorite writer now. She has a witty and unique sense of humor I have never in my life read before. She has a way of making her heros so sexy and so sweet, yet so masculine you find yourself wishing these men were real. Her heroines are always strong and funny. 'The Last Viking' is a must for those who love timetravel romance and those who love comedy. The story is moving and I found myself crying and laughing. Rolfe is sexy and hysterical and you will love the way he handles himself in the twentieth century. Things we take advantage of in our modern world he finds amazing and the story makes you think more about your own life and surroundings.

So she thinks he is Steve Morgan, the main character from the book come to &quot;forcefully seduce&quot; her once again. Soon she realizes she isn't dreaming and he isn't going to seduce her at all, hahaha. Etienne has many emotional scars from the war and is bitter. He doesn't need a woman interferring in his life. Soon Harriet comes to realize she was sent to help him with her modern skills in healing people's minds. The one thing she didn't count on was falling in love with the &quot;male chauvanistic pig&quot;, as she would say. This story was funny as you would come to expect from Sandra Hill and she brings back my favorite characters from &quot;Frankly My Dear..&quot;, it all blends well and will have you laughing and almost crying in parts. the funny thing about this book is, if you pay attention close enough and have already read Rosemary Rogers classic, &quot;Sweet Savage Love&quot;, then you will pick up on the little quirks she throws into the tale with Etienne(which is French for Steve) and Harriet Ginoza(which she is referred to as Dr. Ginny), which are the main characters from Roger's book.

Sinjun has an older brother named Julian and a younger sister named Emma. When Sinjun is 14, the King of England had made a deal to have him married to the Highlander clan's future liard, Christy Macdonald, who is 7 at the time. It's supposed to be a marriage of political convience, to keep the Highlanders 'in line'. The marriage is never consumated and the couple never sees each other for 15 years until unrest begins in the Highlands. Christy must make an heir or the troublemaking neighbor clan will cause mahor problems. She goes to London with the intention of seducing her estranged husband whom she hasn't seen in 15 years who is also known as the legendary 'Lord Sin', a notorious rake and 'seducer of women'. She doesn't want him to reconize her, so she poses as a myserious woman from Cornwall. The ruse works and everything seems to be going fine until she realizes she has lost her heart to the womanizer and he doesnt have a clue that she is his wife. This story is filled with intrigue and treachery. When Sinjun falls for the mysterious woman, he ends up also finding out who she really is, and this is when everything breaks open. Sinjun is sexy and I loved his character. I didn't think Christy was immature like some of the others reviews said. She was desperate to save her clan and the her people from ruination. It was heartwarming and full of life. It will keep you turning the pages until the wee hours of the morning. The other two books are set to come out in 2001 and 2002.<br />Tracy Talley~@	2000-10-26

I don't usually get offended, actually its hard to offend me, but Jonathan (the pirate) is so abusive and careless with Catherine, it was hard to even believe he loved her at all. I tried so hard to look past his brutishness for the sake of it being 1845 and him having a rough childhood, but I just could'nt accept that he ever loved her or ever would. He seemed to be taking his aggressions and past aggressions and anger that had nothing to do with her out on her. It never stopped, not once. She loved him and did all she could for him selflessly and he still took things out on her. I could not warm up to him no matter how hard I tried.

He and his brothers have sworn to never fall in love or marry, all women are trouble, well everything is about to change when Pierce is shot by a group of vigalanties and he has to hide in Zoey Fuller's root cellar. He is accussed of a heinous crime that he didn't cimmit and has nowhere to go. Zoey finds him near death and she saves his life only to coerce him into marrying her to save her ranch from a corrupt banker. Things get out of control when the pair fall in love and Pierce refuses to acknowledge it. I loved this story. Pierce is a man hurting and capable of love, but he is afraid to take a chance.

It's about a supermodel from 1996 transported by accident back to the Old South-1845. Her all-time favorite movie is Gone With the Wind and she dreams of one day finding her very own Rhette Butler, but what she finds when she goes back to 1845 is James Baptiste. A Southern gentleman with an attitude. Her only point of reference to the time warp is the movie and she soons finds that the movies aren't always fact, haha. The scrapes she gets into while James helps her is hysterical to the the least. This story had me crying with laughter and it also tugs at your heartstrings. It's so romantic and James is what fantasies are made of ;)  The sequel to this tale is \\"Sweeter Savage Love\\" and check out \\"Desperado\\" also for a little tidbit of insight into James and Selene's lives later on... ...	2000-10-19

Bradford was kind of a wimp and too irritating to me.  I liked Angela though, and thought she could've done better, lol.  The plot was good, but seemed to never get involved fully.  It was missing something.  She falls in love with Bradford at a very young age and doesn't think she has a chance with the rich gentleman, she is just a poor farmer's daughter.  But they do fall for each other, but misunderstandings soon rip them apart and threaten their love.  I am glad that the character of Hank Chavez has his own story in 'Heart of Thunder', he was so sexy and funny in this one as a secondary character.  This is an early Lindsey, and her later works are much better.	2000-09-25

Desperado is the fastest gun in the west.  He is feared and revered by so many.  Chloe is about to lose her ranch to a bunch of money-grumbing people and needs a fearsome gunslinger to protect her herd as she makes her way to the market to sell them to pay her back taxes.  He is hired on to help her and her herd and her hired hands not more than boys, make it to market, but what Chloe doesn't know is, Desperado has a hidden agenda.  The story was explosive and full of action.  I loved Desperado.  He was pure sex-appeal.  He was reknown for his coldness and meanness, but inside Chloe finds his heart.  I don't know what it is about the way Mason writes, but her men become so real to the reader that you wish they would walk right off the pages.  I loved 'Gunslinger', it's one of the BEST western romances I have EVER read.	2000-09-23

I don't like to knock books, because the authors work so hard writing them, but I was a bit disapointed in this one.  The main character Raven was great, I liked her strong lead, but the male lead of Chase, I wasn't crazy about.  The story was based on a woman who was married to a gambling husband who insisted she sleep with a handsome stranger (Chase) for $1000, this being in the 1800's, that was alot of money.  She she reluctantly did it because she feared her husband if she didn't.  When it was over, Raven soon became a widow by accident.  Chase never knew and went on his way to his ranch in Montana.  Raven was now alone and runs into her brother.  They buy a ranch in Montana, and she soon finds out her neighbor is none other than Chase.  This is where the book should have taken off, so to speak, but it never did.  Chase didn't really seem to care that her dead husband used her like that and I had to wonder what kind of man Chase was to even ask to spend the night with the man's wife.  It nagged me the entire book and when he felt he loved her already, I didn't feel convinced.  There was also a second romance going on in the story that never ended or really took off either.  The villains were real and true villians, but they also never took off, so to speak.  This book had soooo much potential and it upset me that it never truly got off the ground.	2000-09-21

This is the 2nd book in the trilogy 'Trails West'.  The first being 'Tears Like the Rain' and the 3rd being 'Sierra'.  This, 'Wind Rider', is the powerful love story between Windrider and Hannah McLin.  Hannah is an indentured servant to an abusive man.  She escapes him only to run into a Cheyenne warrior named Windrider.  She saves his life from certain death in exchange for being set free, but Fate steps in and she is his prisoner.  Windrider is a white Indian, brought to the Cheyenne when he was little with his sister Abby (Tears Like the Rain).  They were raised like Cheyenne and given names like the Cheyenne.  He soon falls in love with Hannah, but so much turbulance is happening during this time period (1864), and the Cheyenne and Sioux are rallying to fight the whites from settling the frontier.  They are soon torn apart and thrust into worlds they are unfamilar with.  It's a wonderful story of courage and love and brought tears to my eyes many times.  Windrider is also known as Ryder Larson, a white indian living amongst the Cheyenne as a Cheyenne Warrior who had rivaled the most feirce of the warriors.  Connie Mason never disapoints and brings to life a great story.  It's definately worth a read.	2000-09-20

The  history between Wales and England was supurb, I have never read such  acuracy before in a romance book.  Small is so detailed she even brings to  life the smells around you and the tastes.  I was astounded.  The love  story was so different from what i was used to in other romances, Rhonwyn  is the Welsh Prince's daughter and is used as a &quot;bargaining&quot; chip  in the Prince's cooperation with the King of England.  She is forced into a  marriage with Edward, a mere Lord who has knowledge of Welsh language and  culture.  The marriage is a political one and the King feels assured the  Prince of Wales will not give him trouble.  Rhonwyn is a wild and spirited  woman who was raised by her father's soldiers without a mother or female  influence.  Edward is not happy with this, but tries to make the best of a  strange situation.  Soon he is called to fight in the Crusades alongside  (then) Prince Edward, son of King Henry.  She begs to acompany him, because  she wants to fight too.  He relents and soon finds herself captured and  given to the Lord in a harem.  We as the readers learn alot about Rhonwyn's  character in this time she is there and learn about a terrible secret she  has hidden from her husband.  After a year of longing for Edward, she  escapes and finds her way home, only to learn of another horrible truth  that she must now face.  It was such a wonderful story and I loved how  strong and independant she was.  I agree with the other readers too, I wish  Rafe were introduced much earlier.  Besides Rhonwyn, he was my favorite  character.  The secondary characters, her brother and her aunt are  wonderful, and I loved when they appeared, alos her devoted Welsh guards  made me smile with their utter devotion to her.  This is a wonderful story  that should not be missed, and now I am going to read everything from this  talented author that I can get my hands on!	2000-09-18

I have to say that this was one of the very best in pirate romances out there that I have read.  It is full of accurate details and passion that  only Connie Mason could write.  The love between Bliss and Guy is so  heartwrenching that I wanted to cry.  The &quot;pirate&quot; Hunter that  Guy has become will leave you breathless.  He is sexy and utterly oozing  sex appeal.  The villians are true villians in the sense, their hate is  deep and real.  <br />Guy DeYoung is left for dead after an assassin attacks  him and destroys his eye.  Hunter is born, the ruthless pirate.  He is bent  on revenge for the people involved in his misery.  He catches one of the  &quot;enemy&quot; by chance and whisks her off to his island as a captive.   Bliss is used as a pawn in his game of revenge.  Hunter intends on using  her then discarding her, but inbetween there he falls in love with her, and  knows he can't let her go.<br />This is an excellent read, I recommend it to  anyone who likes pirate romance.  The sex is steamy and Mason always makes  you feel as if you are there with the characters.	2000-08-12

This is the third book to the Plantagenet trilogy that started with THE FALCON AND THE FLOWER-book was centered around King John Plantagenet, the second book is called DRAGON AND THE JEWEL-wich is about King Henry III,  King John's son. This book, THE MARRIAGE PRIZE, is about King Edward's rise  to power.  It is a true &quot;fairy tale&quot; in every sense.  Rosamond  Marshal is the royal ward of Simon and Eleanor de Montfort,(the main  characters from THE DRAGON AND THE JEWEL).  She is betrothed to Sir Rodger  de Leyburn when she's 12, but when she turns 17 and Sir Rodger comes to  collect his bride, she refuses to wed him. Eventually he shows her to love,  and he falls madly in love with her. But England is about to erupt in civil  war with none other than her protector since she was a child, Simon de  Montfort and King Henry III.  Sir Rodger is Prince Edward's steward, when  war is right on the horizon, Rosamond and Rodger's love is in danger.  What  side will Rosamond take?  Can thier love survive?  This is a heartwrenching  story of survival and sacrifice.  Virginia Henley is true to her history.   We get to see two sides of this story from two books.  The second of the  trilogy, Simon's side and then this, the third, the King's side.  She also  brings back the character Rikard de Burgh from the 1st book.  This is a  piece of history not to be missed.  Henley is a wonderful and senual  storyteller, she brings these people to life.  None should miss any of  these books.  They are all keepers.  =)	2000-07-23

The first is FALCON AND THE FLOWER and the third is THE MARRIAGE PRIZE.  This story is about Princess Eleanor Plantagenet, the King's &quot;Precious Jewel&quot;.  After  King John died, his children King Henry III, Richard of Cornwall and  Princess Eleanor were left alone to basically run England.  Their mother  Queen Isabella married another and moved on. This is the great love story  of Princess Eleanor Plantagenet and the famous warlord Simon de Montfort,  the Earl of Leicester.  This true story of these two passionate people is  told with such flair and sensuality that only Virginia Henley could tell.  True the story is compressed to about three years, when in reality is was  more like thirty.  But she pulls it off with no problem.  The sequel, and  last book to this trilogy begins in the year 1253, this book ends in 1240.  That is the reason for the dropping off at the end.  The story continues  into the next book, for all those complaining about the sudden abrupt  ending. The characters from the first book make many appearances in this  one, namely their son Sir Rickard de Burgh.  He is appointed the Princess's  gaurd.  In the beginning of the story their is about 190 pages of story  between Eleanor and her first husband, the Earl of Pembroke, William  Marshal.  He was much older than her and when she became a widow at the age  of 17, she took a vow of chastity of perpetual widowhood.  Simon first saw  her and fall in love.  He had to have her at any cost.  The passionate love  these two shared and the enemies and treachery they endured, is awe  inspiring. Simon is breathtaking, a great warlord of his time, and Eleanor  is beautiful and strong willed.  She is a woman ahead of her time.  This  story will make you smile and feel like you are there with Simon and  Eleanor.  Henley has an uncanny knack of bringing the reader into her  world.  I could almost hear the swords clanking and the King shouting. This  is an excellent read, don't miss it.  I have read this many times, and  still find myself enthralled everytime.  Virginia Henley is an extrememly  talented writer, she brings these people to life and shows you the  sacrifices they made for their beloved country, when civil war was knocking  at England's door.  Simon was a great warlord and leader, I think you will  enjoy this great 13th century love story in all it's glory.  It's a keeper.s an excellent read, don't miss it.

I loved this story, by I have to be honest here, the beginning was a bit  slow and kind of dragged until you hit page 120.  I wasn't convinced Ian  was so entranced by Elizabeth in the beginning for some reason.  But the  story did pick up and it was a very good read. Elizabeth is an impoverished  orphan who has her uncle holding her most prized possesion in his hands,  her estate.  He forces her to choose from three unlikely suitors, one of  them Ian Thorton.  A known gambler.  It sort of reminded me slightly of  Cinderella.  I found it interesting to see Clayton Westmoreland mentioned  in this story as someone Ian knew (Clayton Westmoreland was the main  character to Judith McNaught's other story 'Whitney, My Love').  That made  me smile.  Also her other characters from 'Something Wonderful' appeared as  Elizabeth and Ian's close friends, Alexandra and Jordon Townsende.  It's  nice how you can catch up on what they are doing and how things are going  for them in Judith McNaught's books.  Not many authors bother to do that.   I liked the Elizabeth's eccentric butler, he made me laugh with all the  stunts he pulls to get back at Ian.  Her Duenna Lucy was funny also. My  favorite part is when Elizabeth and Lucy have to go to Scotland and hitch a  ride to the cottage, you'll see what I mean when you read it, haha.  The  story had a lot of humor and the characters made you smile.  I would  recommend this story to anyone. It's a lighthearted journey from England to  Scotland, and the descriptions will make you wish you were there.	2000-07-10

She always writes with such feeling and tenderness that you don't find in the romance writing genre.  She brings characters to life, and spans wide ranges of emotions  with them.  This book is no different.  It's a heartwrenching story of an  outlaw who wants and needs to start his life over, and he does it with the  help of one very determined woman, Miranda.  Miranda lost her husband in  the Civil War, and lost her father in a rebel raid on their ranch.  She  meets Jake (the outlaw) by accident.  He is haunted by a terrible past that  is tearing his life apart.  Miranda makes him see he is good inside and  loves him no matter what.  This story takes us through the Midwest, the  Oregon Trail, Nevada desert, the valleys of California, and the boomtowns  of Colorado in a span of over 20 years.  It shows the hardships they endure  and the heartbreak of Jake being a notorious outlaw.  I cried on parts and  smiled on some too.  My heart felt like it was on a rollarcoaster ride.   The emotions this love story evokes is incredible.  I would love to see  this book on the Big screen.  I am sure it would be a blockbuster.  This is  well worth the money and reading time.  I will read this over and over  again.	2000-07-01

This is the story of Jennifer Merrick from Scotland who is abducted by the powerful &quot;Black Wolf&quot;, who is  Royce Westmoreland.  He is the most feared of the nobles of King Henry.   Trouble is brewing between Scotland and England, Royce kidnaps his enemy's  daughter to get the Clansmen to buckle.  The story is filled with adventure  and history.  Knights in shining armor and castles...it's a beautifully  written story of the ancestors of Claymore(from the Whitney, My Love book  and Until You book.)  The heartwrenching love between these two will make  you cry.  Especially when Jennifer swears feality to Royce.  My eyes teared  and my hearty constricted.  It is the most romantic and beautiful scene I  have ever read in a book.  Judith McNaught has an uncanny way of knowing  how to reach into the readers hearts with her writing.  The characters were  people I would love to know in real life.  I especially loved Royce.  He  was so tender and what dreams are made of.  Jennifer would make any woman  proud with her defiance and bravery.  I loved this story as much as I loved  it's prequel &quot;Whitney, My Love&quot;.  This is a must read for those  hopeless romantics out there like me.  The other books in this series are:  Whitney, My Love &amp; Until You, in that order.

I can surely say this is one of the very few sequels to a book that I was extremely happy with.  This is the story of the Earl of Langford, Stephen Westmoreland.  He is the brother of Clayton Westmoreland, the Duke of  Claymore, who is the hero in the first book, &quot;Whitney, My Love&quot;.  The heroine from &quot;Until You&quot; is Sheridan Bromleigh, she's an  American who is sent to be an escort to Charise Lancaster.  Charise is to  marry a Lord Burleton when she arrives in London, a match made by her  father.  But on the way, she elopes with a stranger.  Now Sheridan is  frantic with worry over the predicament she's now in.  Stephen comes to the  pier to meet Charise Lancaster and to tell her of the unfortunate death of  Lord Burleton.  Sheridan is the woman he sees coming to him off the ship,  so he assumes she is Charise.  He blurts out what's happened and as she  turns away, a cargo net hits her in the head.  She wakes up 3 days later  with no memory and everyone is calling her Charise Lancaster!  The story is  funny and witty and romantic.  Many appearances are put in by Whitney and  Clayton from &quot;Whitney, My love&quot; and from Nicki.  Stephen reminds  me of Clayton alot in this story.  He is commanding and sexy.  The problems  he runs into with Sheridan remind me of the problems Clayton had with  Whitney a little, that was my only complaint.  The story was like a  rollar-coaster of emotions.  One time you're smiling, the next time you  feel heartfelt sympathy for the characters.  It keeps you turing the pages.  Judith McNaught is a wonderful author who is new to me.  She brings  heartfelt emotion to her stories like no other.  Many authors strive to  attain what she has, but fall short.  This is a wonderful example of her  work.  Also try her others from this family-The Westmorelands.  &quot;Whitney, My Love&quot; which is first, then this book &quot;Until  You&quot;, and last, &quot;Kingdom of Dreams&quot;; which is the story of  the first Westmorelands.  Also, there is a short story for those interested  in what happens to Nicki.  It is in a book of short stories called &quot;A  Holiday of Love&quot;, the story is called &quot;Miracles&quot;.

First off, I am a HUGE fan of Ms Bittner's work, I have been reading her for about 11 years now.  This is the latest book from this brilliant writer.  The only complaint I had with this book was the shortness.  I love  her work so much and was dissapointed when this one ended, if that could be  considered a &quot;complaint&quot;, lol. The story is about a young woman  who hires a notorious bounty hunter named Christian Mercy to find the men  who brutally murdered her mother and stole all her means of survival.  The  story is set in Wyoming in 1884.  Callie Hobbs is a tomboy who feels she  has nothing to lose by going on this trek across the west, through some of  the most dangerous territory, like The Outlaw Trail.  Callie is young and  innocent, but Christian finds himself falling deeply in love with her.  His  dark past is filled with pain and regret, and he doesn't think he can ever  love again. Callie makes him see different.  This is an exciting story that  only Rosanne Bittner could create so wonderfully.  Both characters are full  of life and I found myself caught up in the story.  It made me cry in parts  and smile in others.  It's a great story that shouldn't be missed.  All of  Bittner's work shouldn't be passed-by.  She writes in a way that has you  feeling you actually are there with her characters in the &quot;old  west&quot;.  Try this book, I don't think you'll be dissapointed....  =)	2000-06-16

This third book in the Birmingham saga left me feeling like more thought should have been put into this.  Raelynn Birmingham, Jeff's wife, wasn't as much fun to read about than her sister-in-law Heather.  The crime Jeff is  accused of couldn't of been done by him, and the fact that Raelynn believes  that he did is out of stupidity rather than trust.  I couldn't seem to get  past that fact in the story.  We read how &quot;in love&quot; they are at  the beginning and it trudges along, until the &quot;crime&quot; is  commited.  Then out of nowhere she doesn't believe him and doesn't trust  him, etc.  I thought it was kinda hard to swallow.  When we do actually  find out who the person is who actually commited the deed, it fizzles.   What was the point?  This whole book was leading up to the person, then I  was left feeling dissapointed at best.  The reasoning is kind of confusing  also.  The entire story I felt was a little hard to believe.  The best  parts are when Heather and Brandon make appearances.      I was hoping Ms.  Woodiwiss would've given Jeff's character a better story.  Raelynn was a  bit &quot;flakey&quot; at times, and I found myself irritated with her.   Sometimes I couldn't understand why he even wanted to be with her.      The  one thing I found that I liked surprisingly was the fact that the story  started off with them already married, a change from most romances.  This  was a &quot;lukewarm&quot; read at best, and doesn't do the Birmingham Saga  justice.  The first book &quot;Flame and the Flower&quot; was the best and  still has my number 1 vote, the sequel is &quot;Elusive Flame&quot;, its  also pretty good, but this last one &quot;Season Beyond A Kiss&quot; isn't  very convincing as even part of this saga.  I hope this helps anyone out  there.....=)	2000-06-14

I admit this was a pretty good sequel to &quot;The Flame and the Flower&quot;.  A bit different from the original, but good.  I usually dislike sequels and find them never holding a candle the  original, but  this one held a pretty strong one.  The beginning was kinda hard to trudge  through in my opinion, but once it got rolling, it was really good.  I  liked the hero Beau Birmingham,(Heather and Brandon's son from The Flame  and Flower)he was a very strong character.  Was alot like his father from  the first book.  Cerynise was a strong heroine and never seemed to falter  and become weak as in some romance novels, she held her own.  My only  complaint was in the &quot;villians&quot;.  The first book, the villians  were really scary and had you wondering what would happen next, very  unpredictable. But these &quot;villains&quot; weren't anything of the sort.   They were clumsy and predictable.  I also was dissapointed in how quick  the couple seemed to fall in love.  They were suppose to be old friends and  she always loved him as a child, but I just wasn't convinced.  Though I was  excited to see the characters from &quot;Flame..&quot; appear.  Heather and  Brandon was funny and the same as usual.  The story line could've been  better.  As with the other reviews, I thought the ending was a bit stupid  and seemed derived from a certain &quot;movie&quot;, but I wont say  anymore.  =)  Also I was as confused as everyone else to what color Beau's  eyes were during the entire book!  One time they were Blue the next they  were like Brandon's(green), then Sapphire!  Aside from that I did enjoy the  story.  Most of exciting part of the story is on the ship to the Carolinas.   I am now looking forward to the 3rd in this series, &quot;Season Beyond A  Kiss&quot;.  I hope this helps anyone out there!	2000-06-09

At first I was skeptical of reading this book mainly because all the reviews warn of the &quot;rape&quot;, etc. But I am so glad now that I listened to my friend and read this for myself. The &quot;rape&quot; has  signifigance to the story's plot.  I know you're saying, &quot;what!  How! &quot;  Hear me out..I have read the newly revised edition, and I have  heard it has been &quot;softened&quot; around the edges, so to speak,  compaired to the older editions.  Whitney you are sure to fall in love  with, she is witty and charming and I even laughed out loud at times. The  humor the author has put into this story will stay with you hours and even  days after you read this. McNaught has a way of pulling you into the story  like no other I have read.  You feel for Whitney. The hero is Duke Clayton  Westmoreland.  At first you want to scratch his eyes out, he is so arrogant  and frustrating, but when he reveals his unconditonal love for Whitney when  she doesn't know it, you feel for him.  The things he does he did for the  unbelieveable love he feels for her. The &quot;rape&quot; is not what you  think, you will know what I mean when you read it(without giving the story  away). Even though it's no excuse for it, but remember ladies, this is the  17th century also... Whitney is forced to marry him because her father  &quot;sells&quot; her to the Duke(Clayton)for a very large sum of money.  The father feels he needs to do this because he is in dire finacial  straits. Whitney is not at all happy with this because she has a well-known  crush on Paul, one of her neighbors.  Clayton at first tolerates it and  tries to get her to get used to him, but he finds himself falling HARD for  her. She still thinks she's &quot;in love&quot; with Paul this whole time.  There's a lot of misunderstandings that happen between Whitney and Clayton  that cause the inevitable anger on his part. The story is so well written  that I fell in love with the characters.  Even the &quot;rape&quot; didn't  bother me as much as I thought it would.  The love that they feel for each  other is so great that it will bring a tear to your eye. This edition also  makes it easier to move on to its sequels &quot;Until You&quot; &amp;  &quot;Kingdom of Dreams&quot;. &quot;Until You&quot; is about Clay's  brother.  And &quot;Kingdom of dreams&quot; is about the 1st Duke and  Dutchess of Claymore.  &quot;Whitney, My Love&quot; is about the 9th Duke  of Claymore, Clayton Westmoreland.  This is a great story, I loved it  beyond words, I hope you will too...idn't  bother me as much as I thought it would.

I am a HUGE Johanna Lindsey fan, I have every book she ever wrote and I love them, but this is a waste of effort to have wrote or read! This book is the follow-up to &quot;Defy Not the Heart&quot;.  They don't even  compare.  The heroine in this book Milisent was weak and did unbelievable  things in this time period(1214) which would never have been tolerated! The  plot was dumb and the hero and heroine lacked any spark of romance or fire  Johanna Lindsey usually has for her characters. The plot calls for this  &quot;danger&quot; to threaten them!  Please! If you read it you'll know  what I mean. The &quot;danger&quot; plot never took off and was gone before  you knew it. Left me wondering why it was there in the first place!  And  the reason she doesn't want to marry the Earl(Wulfric) is a stupid one.  Lindsey could've come up with something better in my opinion.  I was sorely  dissapointed in this book.  Her writing lately is much to be desired.  I  don't want to sound so critical, but come on! If you are new to this  author, I would NOT recommend this book to you as a first, try instead her  Malory books, starting with &quot;Love Only Once&quot;, &quot;Tender  Rebel&quot;,&quot;Gentle Rogue&quot;, &quot;Magic of You&quot;, &quot;Say  You Love Me&quot;&amp; &quot;The Present&quot;(in this order).  This way  you can judge for yourself how well she writes normally. &quot;The  Joining&quot; had some humorous parts in the beginning, but seems to lose  steam midway through and then took a nosedive.  I hope this helps anyone  out there....   =)	2000-06-03

This is my very first Woodiwiss book I have ever read. I loved it! It was easily one of the best or the best book I've ever had the pleasure to read!  This book had pure romance and love.  At first you don't think Brandon  would fall for Heather the way he treats her in the beginning, the cruel  way he treats her after he is forced to marry her because of some very bad  things he does to her and gets her in a bad &quot;situation&quot;.  He vows  to never treat her as a wife, but as time goes on, he falls madly in love  with her, but can't let her know, she would think he hadn't meant what he  said before. She in turn falls deeply in love with him, but can't tell him,  she has a dark secret. There is so much sexual tension in this story it has  you wondering when it will happen between them, but the wait is well worth  it! Word of warning, there is a scene at the beginning which some may find  disturbing, which from some of the reviews you have guessed by now, a rape  scene.  But rest assured, the hero does grow up and take responsibilites,  and the heroine at first seems very naive and whiny, but you must remember  she is still a child really, and becomes a strong woman. There is a villian  and a jealous former fiance, it has all the workings of a great writer.  It  brings you into their world. The second book to this is called The Elusive  Flame, it's the story of their son Beau.  There is also a 3rd to this  family saga called A Season Beyond A Kiss.  Which is the story of Brandon's  brother Jeff.  I recommend this book Flame and the Flower,itis well worth  the money! Also, take note,the original book was actually written in 1972!   Enjoy!	2000-05-29
US	51968865	R2PA2JMMQR6Y69	038097536X	271652627	The Heir	Books	4	4	5	N	N	About a 4 1/2 star book..	This was definately much much better than her last one, &quot;Joining&quot;. Even though this story was sweet and much different than her others, I liked it alot. It was a breath of fresh air. No constant  battle of wills between the characters, just a simple happily-ever-after  love story. At first I have to admit I was beginning to say to myself, this  is sounding fairytale-like, but it didn't turn out exactly that way.   Definately a different sort of fairytale though.  I liked the main  characters Sabrina and Duncan. They were down-to-earth. My favorite part  was when Duncan first kissed her on the porch, it was so sweet and  touching. Your heart goes out to them. The &quot;villian&quot; Opheila, is  so vain you have to laugh. I really liked this story alot, the only thing I  found lacking was the amount of passion involved between Duncan and  Sabrina. I think Duncan needed more description about his feelings and from  his point of view. All in all it was a very good book, just minor  complaints in the passion department and needed a little more action for my  taste..=) And I almost wished she could've fallen for Locke. He was more  passionate to me. I think they made a good couple, but hopefully Ms.Lindsey  gives us his story...=)	2000-05-25
US	51968865	R1H7HVAJF4WRK4	0821724479	49286135	Desert Captive	Books	1	6	10	N	N	Very slow paced and hard to trudge through...	This book was the only book I ever read by this author, so I have nothing to compare it to, but it's horrid. the author isn't consistant in her writing and the story line is so boring. The heroine Alexandria gets  kidnapped from her French foreign escort in the desert by a band of  nomands, coming to find out the prince who kidnaps her she knew as a child.   But the story just drags and doesn't keep intrest where it should.  It had  potential but didn't use it.  The villians weren't convincing to me.  I  just didn't believe in the end that she loved him at all, and he her.  All  in all I wouldn't recommend this book,unless you're very bored, lol.  But  can I make a suggestion if you're wanting to read something exciting and  touching?  Try Virginia Henley's Falcon and the Flower, or Raven and the  Rose.  Or something similar to this book I would suggest Johanna Lindsey's  Captive Bride, which has similar story line, but much more exciting and  interesting...=)	2000-05-24

This was the very first book I ever read from this author and I literally cried on some parts, it was so touching and heart wrenching.  The unbelievable story between the hero and heroine keep you turning the pages  until its over.  This book is full of adventure and rich in Cherokee  history.  The love story between Andrea and Adam is so sweet and touching  it will bring tears to your eyes and make you fall in love with Adam and  Andrea.  The things he suffers makes you wish you could step into the book  and help him.  I HIGHLY recommend this book.  Rosanne's writing is superb.  She brings her characters to life, and the history and surroundings.  Even  though it's out of print now, track a copy of this book down, it's a must  read.	2000-05-23
US	51968865	RNW2AJPCF51GR	0380400480	822913798	A Pirate's Love	Books	3	4	8	N	N	Dark romance	i agree with the comment below about being a dark romance and then turning sour. This was one of the very first books I ever read by Lindsey, but I found the rest to be great. I didn't come away from this book feeling  anything but irritation with Tristan and annoyance with Bettina.  he treats  her bad, but then loves him?  And he still treats her bad until the end!   And she still loves him! Make sure you are prepared for the rape scenes and  violence, this book has plenty.  I only gave this 3 stars because I love  the author and am being nuetral, comparing her other work.	2000-05-18

Malory books are very intriguing and keep you interested. This one is the 2nd in the series. I loved Anthony, he's charming and sexy.  Roslynn is someone you'd like to know in real life.

The frustration you feel for the heroine is just the begining.  The hero is not much of a hero.  He does these things to the heroine out of his moronic  &quot;justification&quot; to avenge his father.  Then just leaves the  heroine to deal with the havoc he has wreaked,then doesn't think twice  about her. We are suppose to believe through all this that he comes to love  her and she him, when I came away thinking, they deserve each other.  I  wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking into reading Johanna Lindsey for  the first time,wait til you've read her other fantastic books to get an  idea of how she usually writes,this isn't it.  I gave her 3 stars because  she's the best in romance authors today, and everyone has an off time, or a  bomb.  hope this helps anyone interested in reading her books.	2000-05-18

Selig wasn't convincing as being sooo upset with Erika.  Erika was in turn too weak for my taste.  And I loved Hearts Aflame, but Kirsten from  that book took up way too much space in this one and was nasty.  i was  wondering if it was the same Kirsten or a new one. I didn't understand how  Selig's mother could even tolerate her son doing the things he did to  Erika, being how strong she was in Fires of Winter. She of all people  should understand how Erika felt, but she didn't. Even Garrick, you'd think  he would've said something. this was a boring Lindsey read. If you're not  an avid Lindsey reader, pass this one up. She seemed rushed to make a 3rd  book for this trilogy, and it shows.	2000-05-18

I agree with the other lady before me, this is the way women of this time were treated, you can't change history! I loved Brenna, but Garrick took awhile  for me to come around to. I just thought the plot could've been developed  more.

It took off well, but stalled and never picked up.  I love all the Malory  novels, but I think this was one I wasn't too fond of.  I agree, we need to  have Jeremy's story!
