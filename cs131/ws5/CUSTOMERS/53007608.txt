US	53007608	R3G8CPJ9YDMNH9	1403303193	435745568	Military Wives 101	Books	2	6	8	N	N	Disappointed	For someone with a BS in \\"Industrial Organizational Psychology\\" and a Master of Public Administration in Public Personnel Management, I would think the grammar and spelling would be a little better.  Between not knowing which 'their' or 'there' to use there were many more spelling and grammatical errors, many of which were pointed out by other readers.  Although you can't totally blame the author for it, because the publisher did publish the book as is, so they should take part of the blame.<br /><br />The story has a lot of potential if you can overlook the above.  As a military vet and military spouse of 20 years I did find it hard to relate to this story as I have never encountered people like this in my career or since then.  I'm sure they exist, but I've never met them and I really just couldn't relate.<br /><br />It is a pretty quick read (a day for me). The story read fast and I had a pretty good visual in my head of the characters and could hear the attitude in their voices.<br /><br />If you are looking to read this book to get a picture of military life, don't.  But if you are looking for a quick summer read, enjoy.	2005-07-13

From his childhood in Israel, to the thousands of women he slept with, to the problems within the band. It's all here. I didn't realize that Gene has never been drunk in his life. I did know that he was a teacher, and loved comic books. I saw him on one of the celebrity game shows and he blew me away. I've always been a KISS fan, and this book did not change my opinion of them negatively. I still think they are one of the Greatest Rock bands ever -- innovative and awesome.<br />A really good read, in my honest opinion.	2003-03-04

A heartwarming romance that I just couldn't put down.  I don't like to give to much away, but I do think that this is a MUST READ!  Nicholas is one of this generation's BEST writers.  Nights In Rodanthe made me cry, and smile at the same time!	2002-10-24

It is the story of Cassandra Burdette, an aspiring LPGA golfer who stumbles onto a murder victim.  Then she heads of to LPGA Q school (qualifying school) and stumbles onto another murder victim.  Naturally, she is a suspect and tries to balance her golf game, with solving the case.<br />I thought I knew who committed the crimes mid-way through the book, and was surprised in the end who was arrested.  However, like all good books, it twists at the end, and the story was redeemed!<br />I really enjoyed this  book.  It was easy to read, and not to heard to follow (especially since the author put a glossary of golf terms at the front of the book).	2002-07-31

It was a quick read for me, and I thought the characters had a great deal of depth to them.  However, I thought the storyline was a bit predictable and the ending seemed a bit rushed.<br />I have noticed this in the last few of Ms. Steel books that I have read. Maybe she, and other authors, need to quit trying to pump books out, and concentrate on writing one really good novel every year or so.  But, that is just my opinion.<br />I would recommend this book for anyone looking for a great book to take on vacation!!	2002-07-22

Unexplained aches, pains and tiredness.  Eventually she receives the diagnosis of Lupus and what happens next in the book is not so much a story of her, but the story of how Lupus affected her family, most importantly, her husband.<br />What I liked is that Joanna didn't pull any punches.  She was very blunt about her symptoms and her feelings.  But, she was also very straigh-forward about the clues she took from her husbnad, Steven.  How she could tell he wasn't &quot;embracing the wolf&quot; and giving her the support she needed.<br />Even though this book was written in 1989, the story is playing out in someone else's life, somewhere in the world.  The treatment for Lupus has changed and more and more people in the world are being educated about it.<br />Reading this book has given me even more hope for the future....knowing how far Lupus education has come, excites me because I know that I, we, are making a big difference in lives of people, real people such as Joanna and Steven.	2002-03-23

I thought it was about Pen Pals, you know, people who correspond via mail.  In this case, pen means the Jennings Women's Correctional Facility.<br />It is the story of Jennifer Spencer who works on Wall Street and takes the fall for her boss who was making some bad deals.  She was not supposed to go to jail, and then once she got there, she knew it was just a matter of time before she got out.<br />Circumstances weren't what Jennifer had hoped for, and in the end she makes unlikely friends, and manages to turn prison life around for all the women at Jennings.<br />A great read -- highly recommended!	2002-02-11

Eileen fought hard against the effects of Lupus.  Every setback that was thrown at her she fought against, and in the end, she lost.  But her strength and perserverance moved me.<br />I highly recommend this book to everyone.  Lupus is a disease that is not as widely known as others, but is very devastating.  We need to to find a cure for this illness so no more people die from it.	2001-12-08

It is 3 different novels, all revolving around the Maitland family.  You have Suzanne, her brother Thomas and sister Diane.  Each story is predominately about one of the 3 siblings, and each story brings you closer to Christmas.<br />For me, this book was a relatively quick read.  The stories are short and you really start to feel a bond with the characters by the 3rd story.<br />A great book to keep with you as you make your holiday rounds, standing in lines, or for those long road trips!	2001-12-02

I read this book on my lunch hour. It's a cute story about a snowmen building contest in the town of Mitford -- the prize being donuts from the bakery.

Not a success in the dating department, she compares herself to her prettier, yet troubled sister whom she always bails out of trouble.  One particular day in the park, an incident brings Hailey unknowingly in direct dealings with the park owner, Tyler Scott.  After meeting, he finds her quite attractive and sets out to seduce her, and tells her flat out of his intentions.  What follows is an intense seduction that leaves Hailey confused and in love -- with Tyler Scott, and his young daughter.<br />Another great story by Sandra Brown!	2001-04-30

This book is her take on life and it is one of the funniest books I have read!<br />Valerie says that, &quot;If life imitated television, teenagers would be twenty-five, Mom would be thirty, and Grandma would be thirty-three.

It was a nice glimpse into the life of Beth Riordan, but what I felt was missing was the other end of the conversation with her neighbor Thomas.  It left too many gaps for me.  However, you can still follow the conversation quite well and see the transformation of their relationship.  it was much like reading someone's private diary.	2001-04-12

Today, Jane Lewis is confident and has a thriving psychotherapy practice, her own radio talk show, a beautiful old Louisiana mansion and her dog, Olive to keep her company. What she is missing, however, is someone to share her life.<br />Jane is haunted by a spirit in her house, as well as the brutal, unsolved attack that ended Connie Bryan's life. The present begins to collide with the past, and a man she admired from afar in college comes in to her life and Jane finds herself re-evaluating he life and everything in it.<br />This was really a great read for me. I have always enjoyed Fern Michaels' books, and this one is right up on my favorites list!<br />The story line was well-written and the characters well-developed. By the end of the book, Jane and all the other main characters felt very real.	2001-03-22

Should you send her to a psychiatrist?  Consult one yourself? Or do you believe, and allow yourself to be swept up in an extraordinary adventure?&quot;  This is the basic premise behind the debut novel by Frenchman Marc Levy.<br />Arthur is an architect who discovers Lauren when he moves into her now vacant apartment.  She isn't a spirit  as Arthur can hear and see her clearly....but, he is the only one.  His best friend thinks he is having a nervous breakdown and others in the community thik he's nuts because he always seems to be talking to himself.  Over the course of this book, Arthur grows to be very fond of Lauren and vows to help save her from having her feeding tube removed - no matter how illegal it might be.<br />I won't go into details about what happened next, as I think I would give too much away. However, I was very surprised with the ending - not what I expected!<br />I visualized this in my mind as a movie, but have yet to cast anyone in the lead roles!!  I enjoyed this book, even if the plot seemed a little far fetched.  I finished it in one weekend, and I look forward to more books by this very talented author!!	2001-03-05

Every Sunday evening they meet for coffee and discussion of their forlorn love lives. Tracie is attracted to &quot;Bad Boys&quot;. You know the type. Guys who are usually too good to be true. Jon falls for girls who never want him &quot;that way&quot;. One day, Jon decides he needs to change his image and wants Tracie to teach him the &quot;tricks of the trade&quot;. Tracie agrees and teaches him how to dress, act, the meaning of unavailability and how to make women &quot;smolder&quot;. The new &quot;Jonny&quot; gets a little too good at this new charade and it puts a strain on their relationship. Eventually the both realize they made a mistake and almost lose their friendship over it.<br />I have always enjoyed Olivia Goldsmith's books every since I read &quot;The First Wives Club&quot; and this book did disappoint, but just a little. I think some of the characters, such as Laura, Molly and Phil were given major roles in the story, yet they were treated as minor characters in the writing. Too much of the background material on Tracie and Jon was left out, leaving me wondering about how they met, etc.<br />But, otherwise, it was a pretty good read. A nice break from the books I've been reading lately.	2001-02-05

I should have known that &quot;Ticket Home&quot; would bring me to tears since the others did, but somehow I was not prepared for them at all.<br />Although this is a work of fiction, it is a great story of WWII, and the Bataan Death March. Mr. Pratt has done a great job with his research on this book (as well as his others) and the story was very credible because of it.<br />There is so much I could say about this book, but I don't want to give it away. It is a wonderful story of love and deception that had me not wanting to put the book down!	2001-01-27

I guess I thought it would be more of a comedy, instead of a book that touches on the very real subject of depression in the character of Mirabelle.  I found myself very surprised at the way the book ended, as I felt like it was steering in one direction, then veered off in another which was a great thing!

She shows how easy it is to not notice the signs of mental abuse and why so many women find it hard to remove themselves from the situation.  I think &quot;Journey&quot; gave me a better perspective on the subject, and perhaps I am more knowledgeable because of it.  I am recommending this book to all of my friends.	2000-11-16

I had read &quot;The Winner&quot;, &quot;Total Control&quot; and &quot;Saving Faith&quot; so I think I was expecting something more along those lines.  Instead, what I got was a touching book about hope and love.  The kind of love that a child has for a parent.  Pure love.  The description of the mountains of Virginia where the story takes place was so real, that I could literally visualize  it.  At various points in the story I wanted to reach out and give Lou and Oz hugs...something I felt they were so desperately needing.<br />The outcome of the book was what I expected to a degree. The story does not disappoint and is now one of my favorite books of the year!<br />Well done Mr. Baldacci.  You have impressed me again.	2000-11-08

Quite truthfully, after reading all the reviews here at Amazon.com I was expecting a horrible book.

What I was not expecting, however, was the twists and turns in the story line that I got with this book.

Maybe it is because he comes from Bowling Green, OH, and that is where my dad is from. Maybe it is because he has overcome so much adversity in his life. Or, maybe it is because he is a fantastic figure skater. I think, it is a little of all three.<br />I was living in Ohio (just a few miles down the road from Bowling Green) at the time when Scottie was making it big in professional skating. We were so excited to have a local boy in the Olympics. And we rallied around him even more as we were told the story of his ill-health as a child, an illness that stunted his growth.<br />Over the years, we all grew up. If there was ice skating on TV, I hoped that Scottie would be there too..in any capacity, commentating, or skating..but I preferred skating.<br />Then, a few years ago IT happened. Cancer. And once again, Scottie overcame the illness and came back on the ice.<br />This book is a wonderful look at what life was like for Scott Hamilton. About the work he put into figure skating, and what life is like on the road. He has bared his soul for this book, and brought himself into more hearts than ever before.<br />This is a highly recommended book for anyone who likes to read biographies, wants insight into life of a figure skater, or perhaps for someone living with cancer who wants inspiration!!<br />I laughed and cried when I read this book. Cried alot! I don't know that I could have handled myself with as much dignity as Scott did. I salute him!	2000-10-16

The story deals with the email relationship formed between Lara and Susan who meet at an online bulletin board for breast cancer.  Susan is a survivor, and Lara has just found a lump.  What happens is an online email relationship between the 2 women, that is supportive and close, although they have never met in person.  These two help each other through some very difficult times in their lives with support, humor and advice.  When they finally meet, it is not in the most ideal circumstances.<br />I loved this book and am recommending it to all of my friends.  I belong to a number of online communities, and this book shows that even though the web is full of &quot;faceless&quot; people, they can become your support system and close friends.	2000-09-27

I just finished &quot;The Rescue&quot; and have to say that I couldn't put it down.  Taylor and Denise both have some pretty intense issues to deal with, and Mr. Sparks writes in a way that you can feel the emotions within each character as if you were experiencing them for yourself.<br />I've read all of Mr. Sparks books and would recommend them all!  Great reading!	2000-09-24

Problem is Stella is dead - and her husband isn't interesting in  remarrying.  Stella requested the opportunity to speak to her husband  anytime she wants, so they communicate via a special phone.<br />I really  enjoyed this book.  Much different than many of the books I've read lately  - no crime, no sex, just a lot of laughs.<br />A quick read and one I  recommend to everyone!	2000-09-10

This was an excellent story about one woman's struggle with identity, self-esteem, weight, and rape. You want to cry, laugh, and rejoice throughout the book. It's really amazing at how-well this male author relayed a woman's point of view. Kudos to Wally Lamb! A must-read.	1997-05-01
