Your heart breaks for Hattie, but in the end she learns that she can rely on herself, even when her own mother lets her down.  If you liked this, I'd also recommend Liar's Club, She's Come Undone, An Egg on Three Sticks, and anything by Ellen Gilchrist.	2004-05-27

It is so good, like the best book I've maybe ever read.  Buy this book for the weekend, you can finish it that fast.

Virginia is a hero for any girl who's been to high school and hasn't fit in.  It reminded me of &quot;She's Come Undone&quot; by Wally Lamb and also &quot;An Egg on Three Sticks&quot; by Jackie Fischer.	2004-05-27

I can't believe Wally Lamb (a man) got this female character so right.  You will swear it's written by a woman.  Sad in spots, but never depressing; by the end you're cheering loudly for Dolores.  Other good ones like this:  An Egg on Three Sticks, A Girl in Parts, Shadow Baby.	2004-05-27

Typical teenage traumas and dramas are turned into hilarious scenes and situations.  Another funny book like this one is Feeling Sorry for Celia.  Also An Egg on Three Sticks but it's both drama and humor.	2004-05-27

This narrator sounds exactly like a teenager, like you're camping out in her mind and you can hear all her thoughts.  It's so real it was like reading a book by one of my friends.  Almost eerie in a way.  I couldn't put it down, I read it really fast because it's just so good.  Other books with real teenage narrators:  Feeling Sorry for Celia, An Egg on Three Sticks, Shadow Baby.	2004-05-27

It's hard to stop and feel any sympathy for the narrator because you're laughing so hard.  Definitely a great summer beach read.

I've never read a book like this, one that takes so many risks, and one in which the writer is clearly 100% committed to tell her truth.  Props to Zoe Trope.  (...)	2004-05-27

Everyone has met or seen someone like Stargirl, the kind of teen who is her own leader and follows nobody.  Then there's Leo, who is more like your average teen, worried about what others think, etc.  I liked getting swept up into their world, yet in many ways it's the same world we all inhabit.

This one is just as good as her others, and I loved the little hints in this book that pointed to her other books.  This book deals with grief and parents and boyfriends and all the things teens have to do deal with.  Other good teens books are:  Durable Goods, A Girl in Parts, An Egg on Three Sticks.

It's clever, dark, bittersweet, and strange -- the usual Chuck fare.  (Trivia:  Chuck was a student of Tom Spanbauer - you might try other &quot;Tom&quot; authors like Jennifer Lauck, Rodger Larson, Jackie Fischer, Joanna Rose, and of course Tom himself -- &quot;In the City of Shy Hunters&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon.&quot;)	2004-05-25

(Chuck Palahniuk trivia:  Chuck was a student of Tom Spanbauer, the well-known Portland (Oregon) writer and teacher.

Crazy whirlwind of a story pulls you into its vortex and spits you out in another century and another geography -- and soon you won't want to leave.  I could easily read 10 more volumes about these characters.
