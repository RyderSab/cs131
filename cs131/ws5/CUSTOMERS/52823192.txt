Captain Redmayne seems so stern, almost cruel but inside beats the heart of a compassionate man.  It takes a woman like Rhiannon Fitzgerald to bring him  out of his shell.  You can see how ones past shapes ones future in both  characters.  Through the story the Captains evil &quot;grandfather&quot;  hangs like a dark cloud over their heads.  And at the end the truth will be  revealed, but not too soon!  The truth can surprise you!!	1999-06-10

Anthony Godby Johnson was one extraordinary youngster and his book reads like an adults.  Just wonderful!!  He brings to light the devestation of AIDS on not only the family but the victim itself. The boy suffered  horrifying abuse, both sexual and physical, from both his parents and the  people surrounding them.  And yet the book is totally devoid of bitterness.   This story is tragic, yet hopeful.  I felt strangely sad and happy when I  finished the story that I have told all my friends about it and am loaning  out my copy!

US	52823192	R222CUMKVLZET4	0821762257	866116676	Highland Fire	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Good.	Two twin sisters, Edana and Aileena, were seperated as infants and have grown into adults never knowing the other.  Highland Fire is Edana's story.  Edana falls in love with a misterious man called the pheonix without ever  seeing his face.  She is then betrothed to Bram Chisholm, knowing she will  never love another.  But Bram has his secrets and they just might be linked  to the misterious outlaw.  This story was confusing to me and I had trouble  keeping track of the various point of views.  Plus I did not quite  understand the political strife tearing the country apart nor Phoenix's  personal reasons for getting involved.  There was enough interesting parts  to keep me from setting the book aside to search for another.  Kathryn is  probably one of the most evil women around and she was deffinetly made  interesting because of that.  The conflict between Edana's brothers and  herself kept the story going.   But Aileena, the sister Edana does not even  know of only appears in the last chapter and then, only briefly.  They will  meet in the sequel Highland Flame, but still I would have liked to know  Aileena better.  The book was interesting enough but not quite my cup of  tea.	1999-05-11

Jered, maybe childish and given to being cruel to Tessa, but it did not detract from the overall story.  The novel was well worth the time to read it.  Jered is deffanatly not for the reader  who wishes her hero to be kind hearted and heroic.  In fact Jered goes many  times in the opposite direction.  But Karen Ranney goes about explaining  the reason for his cruelties and his childish behavior.  Jered does grow up  in the end and Tesse becomes a little less starry eyed.

Prince Nicholas is a wonderful hero, even when he is at his worse and deffenetly un-heroic.  I loved Emma's managerie, for I too love animals the way she  does.  It was an interesting twist about their past life together, but it  certainly did not detract from the story, in fact it added to it.  All in  all this a novel with two love stories rolled into one wonderful novel.   One that ended tragicly and the other that was happily ever after.  Jake,  Nicholas son was a perfect addition and helped Nicholas overcome his guilt  over his brother's death.  I highly recommend this book to anyone!	1999-01-03

And while the prose may be a bit flowery and there are no surprises I trully a truly enjoyed this book.  Damon is a wonderfully  tortured hero and Gwyneth is the perfect compassionate heroine.  There were  some scenes that brought tears to my eyes at its very poignancy.  This is  very emotional book!

Nancy Cane did a marvalous job of creating her fictional world.  One of my favorites scenes involled something that I can only compare to a  cross between Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and the last scene in  Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.  Keeper of the Rings is an edge of the  seat ride as Leena and Tauring undercover a treasonist operation that is in  directly leading back to Tauring himself.  There are many secrets in  Taurin's past that are slowly fed to the reader until nearly the last  chapters.  Questions may taunt the reader...like Why does Taurin cover his  head when it gets darker?  Where is Yllon? and what are the signifacants of  the rings that circle Taurin's arm?  The novel is well worth the read, so  pick it out and settle back you are infore a ride you won't soon forget!!	1999-01-02

While not numbering among my most favorite novels and being very predictable, the tale is sensitivly written with interesting characters, trying to get over  their shared pasts. A reader will delight in Anna and Sam as they try to  find the treasure and keep the other from findng it.  There are quite a few  funny parts that one can't help but laugh out loud in response.

Only the new wagon master, White Wolf, has a rule against single women in his wagon train.  A twist of fate sends Jessica  along with her brothers anyway, dressed as a boy.  White Wolf is walking  two roads in life, not knowing which one he belongs too.  He had been sent  back east to a white man's school as a child, where he was beaten for minor  transgressions.  I wished Ms. Edwards wrote more about his time at the  school.  Due to a betrayal of a woman heading for Oregon, White Wolf will  not tolerate single women on the train.  The character's in the story were  very interesting and you meet many people for her future books.  One of my  favorite characters is Jordon's wife, Coralie, I was impressed with the way  Ms. Edwards brought around her change without making it too drastic.   Jessica has a firy temper, but fortunatly it does not lead her to jump to  too many conclusion.  In all I found this a very interesting novel though I  wished to learn more about White Wolf's past while reading it.  Still, this  was a wonderfully, sweet book.	1998-12-30

Tiger Lil herself is such a self confidant woman, despite her seven(or was it eight?) previous marrages.  She has a name for her nipples which she  calls her kitties, each with a different name.  Archie( don't you just love  that name?!) is a first class con man and is determined to find the family  jewels.  Only he isn't fooling anyone, least of all Tiger Lil.  There are  some down right hilarious scenes when Archie gets stuck in a hidden room or  finds himself hanging from the chandallear just as Tiger Lil walks in.  Oh  and by the way, Archie has a special name for his man part too.  I almost  died of suffocation I laughed so hard.  This is not a book for the prudish,  there are some pretty &quot;HOT&quot; scenes.  So make room on your keepers  shelf, get a oxygen mask, and prepare a cold shower, this ones well worth  the read!!!!	1998-12-30

Never before have I read a romance novel that delt with the sea and the ships and ghosts consigned to serve her in their  after life.  Miranda, is only twenty years old and at times, says and does  things that are rather childish, but maybe that's expected in a girl who  has just left her teen years.  Maybe its her youth, maybe its the tales of  the sea that her father told her before his death, what ever it is, it  alows her to see Eric when know one else has been able to.

You'll have no choice, between these unusual  characters and the man eating chicken who lays eggs on Sawyers bed and peck  marks up and down his arm to the lovable mountain lion, Mariposa, who first  tries to kill him and then adores him and Caraje the vicious black  stallion.  You won't regret reading this book so go ahead and buy it,  you'll never forget it!!	1998-12-19

Logan McCord is a wonderfully scarred and tortured hero.  His kidnapping experience seems to have scarred him permanatly, such as his distaste of  kissing.  Kelly Taylor is a wonderful young woman and neither Logan or  Kelly seem to quite understand the other.  There are some misunderstandings  between the two.  There are many questions the reader may form at the  beginning of this book such as...Who kidnapped Logan?  What were their  reasons?  Maybe the kidnapper is closer to home than anyone thinks.  Why  does Logan barely remember his first five years before his kidnapping?  Why  does he look so much like his &quot;adoptive&quot; father?  Why do his  supposed siblings resent his return? Don't worry. Meryl Sawyer will answer  these questions and more.  The answers may surprise you.	1998-12-03

It kept me on the edge of my seat and I have since read it several more times.  Jim Beckett is one of the most chilling killers I have ever read about. This man is pure evil.   J.T. Dillon, a burned out ex-marine becomes Tess Beckett's savior.  This  book has it all.  Evil, suspense, a suitably tortured hero and a terrified  young woman.  Once you pick it up you won't want to put it down.  This is  not a book for the faint hearted or those who like their novels light and  fluffy.  This is a story that is both terrifying and touching.  Read it!!	1998-12-03
US	52823192	R1EJ2NUOC28S3H	0821760548	546176871	Maybe Tomorrow	Books	3	3	3	N	N	All right.	Leigh Evans is one of the most cynical heroines I have ever read about, maybe too cynical.  Michael St. Claire, once a young street kid, now is a powerful property deceloper and this is how he meets Leigh.  I had trouble  identifying with either the hero or the heroine and did not find this book  all that interesting.  Both characters have painful ghosts to overcome and  emotional traumas from the past undermine this prospective relationship.   Many might find this book a good read, but I found myself bored half way  through the book.  I don't know why, because this is the type of book I  usually like to read.	1998-12-03

She did not disappoint me with her latest PRINCE OF MAGIC.  This is a wonderful book and truly enjoyable, with plenty of dark undertones.  A  beautiful romance, a great secondary romance, and two deliciously evil  people.  It also come equiped with two ghost, former monks Brother Paul and  Brother Septimus.  A wondufully tortured hero and a free spirited you  woman.  Write more stories like this one Ms. Stuart!!	1998-12-03
US	52823192	R2UAFX0IRP2TZW	0380786095	26917620	One Moonlit Night	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Fantastic!	ONE MOONLIT NIGHT was truly a wonderful story.  Dominic St. Bride was no macho hero, instead, much to the villager's surprise he was kind and gentle man.  Though he does have some bitterness to overcome.  Samantha James did  a wonderful job of creating this love story.  When most people think of  prejudice they think of African-American or Asians, not once might it cross  their minds to think of Gypsies. Ms. James weaves in the prejudicial  element of the story like the master of the genre she is.  Olivia and her  blind sister Emily, along with all the villagers, have to deal with their  prejudice against Gypsies.  Another wonderful element of the story is  Emily's romance affair with a Gypsy named Andre.  Because she is blind she  has no idea that Andre is a gypsy, it is only after she regains her sight  that to her horror she finds out the truth.  This secondary love story is  one of the best developed I have ever read.  This book is a true treasure  and I recommend that all should read it.  You might learn a thing or two.	1998-12-02
US	52823192	R2UMXH7KV2LUQY	0061087041	967923775	The Gentleman Caller	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Wonderful!!	This book shows the true enduring power of love.  Jack is torn between two women, one so beautiful it hurts to look at her and the other, so sweet and devout.  In the end Jack learn what truly matters and they both(Rosa and  Jack) learn to let the past go.  During the course of this book Jack learns  what it is to have honor, for the life he lived previously was without.   This is a book about two young women, one so starved her father's love that  she would go to any lengths to have it, the other,the favored daughter,  trying desperatly to hide from her past in the arms of God.  It is a story  of three men.  One who has two daughters and finally when it is too late  learns what really matters.  The other had a nephew, who, to teach him a  lesson in life, consigned him to three years in Hell.  And the last, he  learned his lesson, but is it too late to prove himself to his uncle and  aunt and to the world?  This is a page turner and I highly recommend it.	1998-12-01

This is a wonderful book!  Every character has a secret that entwines with one large secret.  And as the book procedes a little bit of the secret it  dolled out.  I found the book fascinating and could not put it down until I  read every last word.  Some of the characters are not as bad as the appear  and some are worse.  It is for you to jusge.	1998-11-29

Rebecca Paisley's faery world is wonderful! I loved it when Splendor brought the Shakesperean characters to life or when Harmony turned Joudian into a slug and he almost  got eaten by a hawk.  Splendor has one of the most fascinating pets ever  written.  Her pet, Delicious, can be what ever it wants to be.  So through  this delightful romp of a book, you will find a pig racing down the  hallway, a rooster at a wedding, a bat at christmas, and a seal in the  fountain.  Not to mention much more fascinating animal shapes in various  peculiar places.  I had to put the book down so I could catch my breath.  I  won't devulge anymore magical secrets, you'll have to read it to find out.   I gaurantee, that behind each turn of the page, you will be delighted and  dazzled by the sheer magic of this book.	1998-11-27

Both Storm-In-The-Eyes and Tess Summar are wonderful characters and in love from the very beginning.  There are very few denials of love between the two and they both, from the beginning, know  they want ot live together.  This is refreshing change from novels where  both characters are at each other throats from the beginning to almost the  end.  But Ms. Camp does not bring them together too soon, if she does that  the book would be over.  Storm has to deal with the prejudices of the  white's and he feels that he is a curse to his people.  He fears what would  happen if he brought Tess into his tribe.  Tess, from almost the very  start, wants to live with the Blackfeet.  There she would be treated with  respect as the Medicine Woman she is and not as a second class citizan.  I  hope you read this book.  The descriptions are wonderful, the people  heartwarming, and you will have chance to learn more about the Blackfeet  and their culture.	1998-11-20

When I first picked up this book and started to read, I thought it rather silly, not in a good way either.  But I did stay up reading until the wee hours of the morning.  Not because I was at all interested in Gabe Hart and  Caitlin Burke.  I couldn't put it down because I was fascinated with the  seconday character Juan Chaves AKA Jonathon Rush.   Gabe is a sweet  character and Caitlin can be thoughtless and somewhat spoiled.  Gabe is  just not my kind of character.  I love the ones that you wouldn't want to  meet alone, on a dark street.  Juan is that and I love him for it.  I found  myself skipping pages just so I could find out more about Juan Chavez.  I  felt sorry that he doesn't have a book of his own, but he does have a happy  ending.  To my mind he was better developed than Gabe Hart.  So I can't  recommend this book, because I found myself too fascinated with the  secondary characters, that I forgot about the main ones!!	1998-11-19

I loved the descriptions, they were so descriptive that I could see it all before me.  Catherine Anderson is a great author and Cherish lives up to her clame to fame.  The hero Race  Spencer, despite a painful past, is so sweet you will want him for  yourself. And Rebecca, while fragile in appearance, is stronger than she  thinks.  Read it, you won't be disapointed.	1998-11-01

This a magical book, full of warm hearted humor and just a little bit of a mystery to keep the book interesting.  One of the best part is the relationship between the two men who survived the plane crash. Who is who?   Ms. Weir does not let that secret out but throws hints about Dylan that  could go either way.  The ending is unusual as to what happens to Daniel  French and Trevor Davis.  I truly enjoyed every minure of reading this  book.	1998-10-28

If I were her I would have jumped into his bed, or wherever, quicker than you can say nine lives.  I wish more real men were  like Gian Ren and his brother Rejar, kind and gentle, yet sizzling with  sexual magnatism. I also read Knight of a Trillion Stars, Lorgin's story  and Rejar, you can guess who's story that is and I loved them both.  I hope  Dara Joy will give us Traed's tale, I've been waiting forever to read about  him! Maybe in the future we will read about Dariq and what truly happened  to the young familiar after he had been brutaly beaten and left for dead.   I just love Dara Joy's books!!	1998-10-28

I awaited with baited breath for the  next shoe to fall.  When will the brother's find each other?  Would Claire  regain her sight?  Who was the killer?  And believe me that particular  question was a total surprise.  What about Sarah's baby?  Is it alive and  if so, who is she/he?  All these questions and more were answered by  reading the book.  By the end I felt like crying at the very tenderness of  the novel.  I implore all readers out their to pick up Imagine Love by  Katherine Stone and read it.  Once you do you will really, truly imagine  the power of love.	1998-10-01

I guessed quickly who was the Yenaldlooshi, but still I was surprised by  the reality.  I almost cried when the Yenaldlooshi was killed, for I did  not want him to die.  Even though he was responsable for a series of brutal  murders.  He was only human, battling a great evil.  That is essentially  what this book is about, the battle between good and evil.  Jackson Walker,  who's own mysterious past leads back to the reservation and Ainnii's  father, has no belief in the supernatural, until he is forced to face its  reality.  I couldn't leave the book until I had read all the way through  and even now, my mind shifts through the hidden facets of the story and in  my heart, there is a deep saddness for the Yenaldlooshi, the true victim in  the novel.	1998-09-27

I walked around the house like a zombie, my eyes glued to the page.  Not  the inconvenience of cooking nor the movie playing on T.V. succeeded of  dragging my eyes from between the pages.  The characters are so REAL.   Garry is such a sympathetic character, not at all macho like many romance  novels, but deffinatly a man.  Jeremy, Robin's son is an adorable scared  little boy and his affection for his toy horse, Traveller, that he made  with his own hands just makes you want to cry.  Robin is one of the  strongest women I have ever read about.  Every character portraid in the  novel seemed very real and human to me.  Even Major Corley.  I found myself  feeling sorry for him, even though he was the next thing to evil.  This is  a keeper for sure, I'd recommend it to ANYONE!!	1998-09-26

Its about Jakob Stoner who gets shot in a  bank robbery in the nineteenth century.  Nine times since, he has been sent  on various assignments for Heaven.  Now his tenth and last time is upon  him.  Gwen Ashton and her four year old niece Crissie have just bought a  ranch, when Jake turns up.  Much to Jake's surprise the ranch they bought  turns out to be the ranch that had been his before he dies.  <br />There are  misinterpreted motives, a contested deed, and a sinister man driven by  greed all rapped up in this romance.  My only complaint is that Gwen never  did find out who Jake really was, I kept waiting for the bomb to drop or  for Jake to tell her but it never happened.  This book, while predictable,  is an enjoyably relaxing read.	1998-09-23
