Although you won't have to face each problem, the advice is sound and the reasoning behind the advice is bound to be helpful in some aspect of your financial life.<br />One problem, ignored by other authors, is how to handle the situation when an aging parent makes bad (wasteful) financial decisions.  Do you sacrifice your own retirement savings to bail them out, or is there a better solution?  Opdykes answer is worth the price of the book.<br />Other topics are covered in a thoughtful manner.

The tone of the book is friendly, supportive and easy to understand. We found the specific signs easy to model for our son. He seemed to pick it up so very quickly. Our 4 year-old daughter, although very capable verbally, also likes to talk to her baby brother with the sign language. We would also like to recommend another friendly book full of wit and wisdom that continues to clearly demonstrate how to communicate more effectively (with words) to the next age group called 'The Pocket Parent'. This book explains how important it is to give toddlers the words for their feelings early on which goes hand in hand with Baby Signs. The Pocket Parent gives hundreds of fast answers to handling most of the most challenging behaviors of a 2-5 year (i.e. tantrums, bedtime and mealtime refusals, I hate you's, gimmees, and whining). Both sanity saving books have lowered the frustration level of both parents and children in our family. We are so grateful that we found 2 books that have taught us specific ways of how to communicate much more effectively with our young children. Consider both reasonably priced books for your personal library.	2003-11-10

He goes further by showing how investing in a portfolio of index funds allows the average investor to achieve both less risk and and an expectation of higher returns.  Thus the investor is in tune with the precepts of Modern Portfolio Theory.<br />The proof is here - trying to beat the market is a loser's game.  It's way against the odds and neither individual investors nor profesionals have deomonstrated any ability to beat the market on a consistent basis.

I must admit I had previously thought of attachment parenting as relating only to nursing babies. Sears clearly explains that a solid foundation in a \\"connected parent/child relationship\\" along with firm boundaries, effective communication skills and behavior modification strategies, will (over time) develop a child's<br />conscience and internal motivation to WANT to do the right thing. I have 3 young children under the age of 6. I highly recommend this book for it's comprehesive explanations of theory and attention to issues of special needs children as well as to some common worrisome issues of 6-10 year olds. If you have young children like me, I also recommend a very practical A-Z guide called \\"The Pocket Parent\\" that is written only for parents of 2-5 year olds. This literally pocketsized book is not written in paragraphs, but rather sanity saving bullets of quick read tips and examples often including the exact words to try. It is organized alphabetically by behavior topic (anger, biting, gimmes, hitting, listening, lying, morning crazies, whining, etc) and can quickly suggest a strategy at a moments notice. I refer to these 2 compatible books again and again. I am pleased with the increase of cooperation from my kids as well as the general feeling of well-being in my household.(...of course, that's on a good day!...My kids are normal and often quite challenging!)	2003-09-17

Mornings were especially unbearable! I would routinely scream from the kitchen-\\"How many times do I have to tell you?...Turn off the TV this minute!...Your breakfast is getting cold!\\" The truth is that my actions did not reinforce my words and they really didn't have to comply until the third time I asked- when I finally put down what I was doing in the kitchen, ran into the family room and stood right in front of them ranting and raging like a crazy women--veins popping out of my neck shouting threats that I knew I couldn't carry out like...\\"That's it!...Get going or I'll...I'll...I'll send you both to live with Grandma!...FOREVER!!

It was suggested that in order to get my children to change their behavior, I needed to learn how to change mine first! Although it felt awkward at the beginning, many of the tips and strategies in this book are still working. Things are going much better in our house. If you have preschoolers like me, I also recommend taking a look at \\"The Pocket Parent\\", a small very practical reference guide with the same philosophy, formatted differently... alphabetically for quick access to \\"sanity savers\\" for behaviors like, biting, hitting, interrupting, lying, and whining.

I am a very \\"over-protective mom\\" and reading his book has encouraged me to stop making so many choices for my children. I am now better able to allow my child to fail and take ownership of the consequence that follows his actions without feeling so much guilt myself. Kids can definitely learn from their mistakes without losing their self-esteem. Although I do not agree nor use every strategy in this book (like \\"The German Shepard Technique\\"), I feel the Love and Logic philosophy has contributed positive change in the way we communicate with our children as well as to the degree of compliance we get from them. We like this book because there are many specific suggestions in the real life annecdotes demonstrating the exact words to try. We also recommend another book with quick-read suggestions for parents of 2, 3, 4, and 5-year-olds called 'The Pocket Parent.' This book is not written in paragraphs, but rather hundreds of short bullets of practical information. The philosophies of both authors are very similar--offering many sanity saving alternatives to yelling, bribing, threatening, critizing, and nagging that we often resort to at our wits' end..

So much of what determines how a child is going to fit into the world depends on his strengths (not weaknesses) along with his degree of self-esteem (not necessarily his IQ or SAT scores). This book is a must for all parents, especially those who feel their child simply does not compare to the &quot;kid next door&quot;...you know, the one who seems to be good at everything. Although that may be true, Goleman says that by nuturing and teaching to the Emotional Intelligence and strengths of your child, the chance of success in future years will be increased. ALL children have the ability to accomplish goals. Maybe your child is extremely good in his interpersonal skills--well-liked by his peers and blessed with the gift of gab and a great sense of humor. These are perfect qualities for a successful salesman. The fact that a child does not test well in math or written English skills and has a very average IQ is not directly significant in how successful he will become as a salesman. Those kids that excel in the arts may enjoy huge success in a career as an actor, artist, film producer, or photographer, especially if his Emotional Intelligence is high. In addition to giving a child unconditional love, I feel it is our job as good parents to identify our children's strengths in the early years and give them plenty of chances to experience challenges, accomplishment, and joy in those areas. Along with this excellent theoretical book, I highly recommend for those of you who have young children, another very practical book called &quot;The Pocket Parent.&quot; This quick-read A-Z guide will give you many specific strategies for increasing the &quot;emotional intelligence&quot; of your 2- to 5-year-old through better daily communication and positive discipline.

I'm sure I will continue to consult it as my children get older. I really like the \\"How To Step In So You Can Step Out\\" strategy that teaches parents how to intervene by acknowledging the feelings of both kids in the heat of the moment which defuses the situation so the kids can work it out themselves.  I like the simple cartoons that clearly illustrate the communication \\"do's\\" and \\"donts\\" with quibbling siblings. I also like the way the discipline tips maintain the dignity of both the parent and the child. When I am able to resist \\"automatic parenting\\" reactions like yelling and threatening, and use some of the great techniques I've learned, I feel so much more competent as a parent. Because I have three young children (5, 3, and 2 months), I would like to also recommend a new pocket-sized book that has been very helpful addressing my specific current sibling issues. Appropriately entitled \\"The Pocket Parent\\", the entire book is written for parents with normal, but often challenging preschoolers.  There are hundreds of short bulleted suggestions addressing sibling issues such as: \\"the new baby\\", \\"comparing and labeling\\", \\"sibling rivalry\\", \\"hitting and hurting others\\", \\"biting\\", \\"bad words\\", \\"I hate you's\\", \\"listening\\", \\"power struggles\\", and \\"traveling with the kids\\". These two books with exactly the same discipline philosophy compliment each other--both having great examples of the exact words to try in many sibling situations.<br />One of the strategies suggested in both books that has really reduced my frustration level is to redefine being \\"fair\\" as \\"meeting each child's needs\\" rather than focusing on being  totally \\"equal\\" at all times.  This thought is very helpful because my kids seem to always keep score...and I, no matter how hard I try--will often lose! Although it doesn't come naturally, I am learning to change my behavior to address needs. For example, Sunday morning I painstakingly tried to serve the exact same pancake presentation to each of the kids--and my son whined, \\"Mommy, that's not fa-a-ir!\\" and he continued to scream that his sister's pancakes were much bigger and browner than his (...in his mind, proof that I love her more). Instead of really losing it and yelling back that he was absolutely wrong, lunging for my ruler to prove it...I PAUSED...And, before I responded, I took a deep breath (...maybe 2 deep breaths) and focused my response on solving the jealousy problem. In total control of the situation, I looked my son directly in his eyes, put my hand gently on his shoulder as I replied in a very calm voice, \\"Hmmmmmmm. It sounds like you're still hungry, Brian...Here are two more delicious pancakes just for you!\\" GREAT ADVICE...and it worked!! Bad news...It does take practice, but feels so good when your thoughtful response avoids a no-win power struggle.d to serve the exact same pancake presentation to each of the kids--and my son whined, \\"Mommy, that's not fa-a-ir!\\" and he continued to scream that his sister's pancakes were much bigger and browner than his (...in his mind, proof that I love her more).

This book addresses many of my own angry thoughts and screaming tirades when I'm just about at my wits' end with my 3-year-old twins--(whom I truly love with all my heart). I don't often discuss my feelings of guilt and failure as a perfect mother. The author's style of addressing these negative feelings is honest, comforting, and insightful.  I highly recommend this book to most mothers. It is true to life and full of helpful annecdotes we all can relate to..it's like talking to a caring friend. There is one caveat--this book has a strong religious bent that is not obvious from the title or cover of the book.  This tone may come as an uncomfortable surprise to those readers who are not Christians.  Therefore, I would like to also recommend \\"The Pocket Parent\\"written exclusively for parents of 2- to 5-year-olds that gives the same type of \\"verbal hug\\" to its readers without ant religious references. The very first chapter is \\"Anger\\" and includes short bullets of information called \\"sanity savers\\" that do just that. In each chapter of this A-Z guide is a welcomed \\"Takeheart.\\" They all start out like this...\\"Take heart, you're not the only parent who... (ie...blurts out the very things you had sworn to your mother you'd never say when you had kids!\\") Both books are loaded with humor, compassion and practical \\"how-to\\" advice that is now bringing more peace to our family and more cooperation from our kids.

Anxious parents welcome kind support and easy to understand facts so that they can become more confident in making the many necessary decisions regarding their children. &quot;Caring For Your Baby and Young Child; Birth to Age Five\\" is conveniently formatted and offers an abundance of helpful, sound information addressing the many questions and concerns that arise during the early years. It is especially helpful in explaining common health issues thereby often relieving a worried parent on the spot about those many wonders and fears that occasionally come to mind. Although this book covers a wide spectrum of information, I noticed that the advice relating to discipline strategies and child development insights for the 2-to-5-year-old isn't as extensive as the medical information or the specific infant behavior suggestions.  I would like to also recommend another helpful reference book to fill that need.  &quot;The Pocket Parent&quot; is a troubleshooting A-Z guide focusing on challenging preschool behavior and is written in the same friendly, non-judgmental style as &quot;Caring For Your Baby...&quot; Parenting, especially in the early years can feel scary, lonely, and quite frustrating. These two books are very compatible, having the same underlying positive perspective and philosophy for raising healthy, happy children.

Baer &amp; Gensler show the reader why investing in traditional mutual funds is a losing proposition.  The professional money managers who run these funds are NOT able to beat the returns available from index funds.  Not only that, but they charge management fees for their inability to perform better than index funds.  Couple that with the huge amount of trading fees generated by the fund managers, and one wonders how they can stay in business.  The obvious answer is that too few pay attention to these details.<br />This book warns you about wasting your money by investing in these funds.  The recommended alternative is not to attempt to beat the market.  Instead, save money, reduce your expenses, and manage your money yourself.  Buy index funds - or even better yet, buy broad based exchange traded funds (ETFs).  Doing so achieves an investment return very close to that of the overall market - and you are much better off by the amount of those exorbitant fees you save.<br />I would go these authors one better by suggsting that buying ETFs can be combined with a covered call writing strategy that provides protection against loss and an increased opportunity for profit.

He considers market events to be random, and thus unpredictable. He offers piles of data to support his contentions, and his arguments are compelling.<br />Yet, those who trade using technical analysis scoff at books such at this, claiming their systems consistently beat the averages. The author points to the fact that most managers of mutual funds, pensions etc. fail to perform better than index funds and Malkiel recommends that public investors place their investment money into broad based index funds. The S&P 500 Index fund is recommended, as it is unrealistic to expect fund managers to perform better.<br />This classic has been around for 30 years and this revised edition is worth your time, especially if you have never read an earlier edition.

This time around she offers 5 basic principles (she calls them 'laws') about money. These laws are right on the money and apply to almost every reader. Adopting these laws will definitely lead the reader to a more satisfied financial life. The second part of the book (NOT written my Ms. Orman) is a guide enabling the reader to make these laws part of his own life. The very first law is to be truthful about money and to stop lying to yourself and others. For example, if you drive a more expensive car than you can afford, or if you dress in the latest expensive styles, even though they are beyond your means, or if you pile up credit card debt to buy items merely to impress others, then you are lying to both the outside world (pretending you can afford those items) and to yourself (telling yourself it is ok to live on borrowed money). Coming to terms with those lies, being truthful and living within your means is the road to avoiding financial misery. This lesson is not new, but Orman's presentation is. The message is powerful and presented well. Some might try to compare this writing to that of Kiyosaki, but that is unfair. Kiyosaki's writings are inspirational and uplifting, but short on real advice. Orman's latest book is not only insightful, but offers good advice and the guide is helpful in getting the reader to follow the advice.	2003-03-12

That he met strong resistance every step of the way is not surprising.  Those who made their money and maintained their power by keeping public investors in the dark were not about to allow Levitt to change the old way of doing business.  He persisted and progress was made under his administration.  Even more changes have been made since he retired from the SEC as the debacle of Enron and others made it apparent that the old system no longer worked.<br />This well-written tale deserves its best-seller status.	2003-03-01

In fact, sometimes it is the parents who encourage their children to become 'branded'.<br />The clothes they demand, the makeup they use, even the colleges they want to attend; all must be brand names.  The hard sell is everywhere: magazine and TV ads are the most obvious, but the movies and music videos they watch, even the video games they play feature brand name items in glamorous settings.  Our children succumb to the need to be like the movie stars and pop singers.<br />It is not enough to want to wear the same brands as the stars and models, they crave to be look-alikes.  Thus, teenagers are demanding cosmetic surgeries as never before.  Craving to be super thin, some resort to starving themselves (anorexia).  The girls want liposection and bodily enhancements; the boys want to be more muscular and powerful.  Dangerous medications and surgeries are comsumed in ever increasing numbers by our young generation.<br />This eye-opening book tells the story.  No child is too young to be a target.	2003-02-19

Businesses must be flexible enough to change with the times, or may not survive.  The change in the companies that comprise the Dow Jones Industrual Average changed drastically over the years, and the trend will continue.  The majority of stocks currently listed in the Standand &amp; Poors top 500 companies will no longer exist 25 years from now.<br />The process of creative destruction will allow those companies benefiting from yet-to-be-invented technologies to grow at amazing rates, replacing those business that fail to keep pace.  Noting that more welath was created during the past 100 years than in all previous history combined, Waite feels the rate of wealth creation will accelerate, with the next 25 years producing more wealth than was created during the entire 20th century.<br />The Industrial Revolution was made possible by technologies generated from Newtonian physics, and our future will be enhanced with inventions from quantum based technologies.	2003-02-17

This book is an important work.  Even if his predictions do not materialize, the possibility must be considered.<br />As much I as do not want to believe Prechter, this book gives the reader much to ponder.  My relatively conservative approach to the stock market makes me think I have a reasonable amount of protection for my portfolio.  But Prechter's expectation that the Dow Jones Industrail Average will plummet to under 1000 puts that belief in jeopardy.  Each reader must decide for himself how much protection is required.<br />Read this book, then make your decision.  Your financial life may depend on that decision.	2003-01-18

I am a fan of Nancy Samalin's positive discipline techniques that are based on Dr. Hiam Ginott's philosophy of teaching kids right from wrong.  I love this book because it<br />covers so many issues and so many tips and techniques to try with children of all ages-- tots through teens.  I don't have the time nor the desire to read an entire book cover to cover that only addresses one subject.  I just want the \\"how to's\\" in a nutshell.  This book is arranged so that I may easily consult it--even in the heat of the moment, when I 'm at a loss of what to do instead of my knee-jerk automatic reactions of yelling, threatening, criticizing and nagging that simply aren't working anyway.  I find that I get more cooperation from my kids (including my husband) when I am able to first change my approach.  I realize that it is often HOW I say \\"it\\" that will determine whether I get the compliance I'm after.  I would also like to highly recommend a wonderful pocketsized paperback based on the very same philosophy.  So, if you have preschoolers like me, \\"The Pocket Parent\\" is written exclusively for parents and teachers of 2's, 3's, 4's, and 5's and is formatted alphabetically by behavior ( such as bad words, biting, gimmes, hitting,  lying, whining, etc.) These two books offer many, many options about how communication can change for the better, still enforcing the necessary limits, while responding with understanding and empathy for the child's feelings.  This approach includes many sensible, humane ways to solve problems that often require quite a bit of practice.  I feel like I'm a much better parent when I am able to use this philosophy.	2002-12-02

In addition, she covers many topics offering good guidance for her readers everyday lives, including how to decide between renting or buying, how to find a bank and choose the right type of account to open, etc. My only complaint with her advice is the suggestion readers &quot;consider mutual funds your entire investment universe, at least for now.&quot;  That is bad advice.  Now is the time for learning how to invest in individual stocks and how to use options to make those investments safer.

On the contrary, most of the now wealthy were ordinary people just 2 or 3 decades ago.  The majority lived beneath their means.  They did not choose to buy fancy cars; nor did they strap themselves financially by buying more house than they truly needed.  They were able to accumulate wealth, even though they were not the highest paid people in the country. They did not spend money to give the appearance of being rich.  They chose to plan for the future and worked hard at becoming financially independent. They achieved this goal by saving part of every paycheck, budgeting, and by paying careful attention to their investments. The authors assure us that we can do the same if we are willing to accept a not wasteful lifestyle. Saving and investing are mandatory, as wealth comes from accumulating growing assests and not from ever increasing salaries. This philosophy goes hand in hand with my recommending that investors learn about stock options, for those investment tools can be used by the prudent investor to make his portfolio safer.
