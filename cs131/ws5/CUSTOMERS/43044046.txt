US	43044046	RNL0SHBCWOJQP	1594480001	659516630	The Kite Runner	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Captivating Sincerity	Since so much has been written, just several comments about this thought provoking astounding book (beware, some spoilers ahead). <br />One of the reasons this book speaks to me is its captivating sincerity. Needless to say the whole story is based on a very uneasy \\"confession\\", but as that is only a literal confession, I would like to mention other examples.   I especially appreciated the fact that the writer does not descend to idealization and a happy ending. He remains very accurate and human in his descriptions of the boy's condition and his wife disappointment. He gives you a feeling there is a very long way to go if ever to achieve a normal existence. However, the state the boy has entered into is so appropriate (if this word can be used) to what he went through. Horrible deeds that a grown up person could not have withstand. Another example would be the convincing description of the father, especially his struggle in a new country and how he dealt with the many crucial decisions he took in his life.  <br />Since there were so many accurate/realistic descriptions I wonder if the slingshot usage during the climax confrontation can indeed be considered a true behavior. Was Sohrab not in the victim situation?. From where did he get the power to do anything to such a powerful man who was the holder of his life? How could he trust this new person he did not know? I therefore consider this scene to be quite \\"literal\\" in the sense that it is there for the sake of the story.  <br />I liked the fact that the secret revelation does make things fall into place and explains  the past to us. I liked that it gave a meaning and an answer to many questions.  <br />As always, one personal story helps to better understand a situation of a whole country then hearing about a mass of people. The book was disturbing and had many difficult moments but it had a very important educational value further to its other remarkable qualities. <br />	2005-09-08

I guess somewhere along the first three books of this series I understood that there is no need to be frustrated with the very unserious way the author deals with Mma Ramotswe detection work. This is not a book about crime, but about Africa and the ways of its people. It seems Alexander McCall Smith has a very clear agenda which is to hail old Africa and the old Botswana ways, a message he delivers across all books of this series.<br /><br />Another issue that bothers me is the fact that there is no differentiation between the characters way of speech. Mma Ramotswe very unique talk is repeated by all other characters.  What I mean is that unless this is some kind of a special African way of speech (which might be the case and I am just too ignorant to know) then all the characters seem to speak in the same way. All talk in the very short sentenced, one thought at a time speech. A good example would be the following: \\" That is very sad\\", said Mma Ramotswe. \\"But the late dog would not have suffered. At least there is that\\". Or Mma Makustsi writing a letter in the same style: \\"This is a very moving essay, which is well typed. You should tell this lady, though, or she might never know. You should ask her to go with you after the class. That is what you should do\\".<br /><br />And yet, after all my criticism is said and done, I do find myself returning to this series and buying the next book in line. There is still a charm to the traditionally built Mma Ramotswe and all her surrounding characters which we grow to be fond of. My favorite is Mma Matuski, but that's my own problem.	2005-09-03

Feelings that have been bottled up under the surface and find a moment to explode, in many different ways.  Reinhorn describes a host of characters, each one is a whole entity, a round character full of different angels and many inner wounds. The stories are all disturbing in this way or another and each one can be dealt with and analyzed in detail. This, by the way, is some of my frustration with such a rich book of short stories. Each story is a world of its own. I felt it is hard to read more then one story in a sitting as they are so strong, vivid and full.<br /><br />In \\"F--- you\\", a woman in some kind of personal distress that is only hinted upon picks a young boy of the road, acting, as \\"she should\\" in normal motherly situations. But somehow, although her behavior starts as seemingly appropriate, the situation turns to be awkward when she finds herself outbursting in front of this boy in her back yard pool. She now has an audience to turn her frustrations against. Although the woman does not do anything really harmful, we feel her behavior deteriorating and her way of speech seems totally out of place. This story is quite uncomfortable to the reader as many of the \\"not do\\" rules of conduct are broken and you get a picture of a woman on the edge.<br /><br />\\"Big Cats\\" gives us a minute-by-minute detail of an escalation of the relationship between two teenaged girls. As the story develops we learn that each one has her reasons to team up with the other. One needs the audience and the other is drawn to the (seeming) strength the other is projecting. Once the roles seem to slightly change, hell breaks loose and they end up in a catfight in front of the lion's cage. Here is a moment of revelation for one of the girls, the narrator.<br /><br />Another story, \\"Heights\\", is a story of a young woman living with her flirtatious mother and a stroke-ridden father. A very heavy feeling clings to this story, same as the two former stories; something, is clearly not right. This is not a regular, \\"cultured\\" behavior. The situation spread in front of our eyes is very disturbing, and reaches a climax again, with an outburst.<br /><br />\\"White Dog\\" is the story of a woman knowing the days of her white dog are numbered. The story describes the role of the white dog in her life in what we understand to be a replacement of a child, and maybe even a replacement of a real connection with a male partner. I understand this as a story of alienation - there are hardly any names in the story. We have the woman, the white dog, the photographer or ex husband - only the Japanese drummer is sometimes referred to as \\"Ohici\\" and the fact that he receives a name can be further analyzed.  It seems that the woman is sufficient directing all her love to the dog and therefore does not need to build any real relationship. The reader cannot understand what went wrong with Ohici or with her ex husband as they seem close even today, and the waste of it all is quite hard to take.<br /><br />However I guess that the story I liked best in this collection is \\"By the time you get this\\" since the outburst of emotions in this story is so touching it can not leave you indifferent. Although told by a grieving mother, mourning and analyzing herself and the death of her daughter, the story is really about her connection with her maid, Lydia who is the center of the story. The maid is the real link to the dead daughter and parting with her will be parting again from the girl. The bond between the narrator and her maid is described slowly. From the beginning we understand that this is not a regular maid and that parts have been slightly changed here. The maid is the one who is in charge and she is the one who understands that she must end the unhealthy connection with her boss. The love of the narrator to Lydia and her son and their importance in her life is the center of this story and I found it to be special in many ways. The narrator is a very educated woman, whereas Lydia is a very simple person. However, the narrator finds herself drawn to Lydia's world and lets her lead the way, at least for a while.<br /><br />The stories depict all of modern age problems and difficulties. They deal with people of different places and status, all suffering from very deep wounds. The stories are told with a loving eye for all people and all of human flaws.<br /><br />My only comment would be that these are not always people that are easy to identify with and usually, I , as a reader, look for characters who are closer to myself or characters that are able to evoke some kind of sympathy or identification. Most of Reinhorn characters are not like that. Reinhorn deals with people who are on the extreme and most of our lives are really in between, not high and not low. All endings do not give a solution but sort of encapsulate a certain situation. On the other hand there is nothing soapy or unreal here, as painful as the stories are.e unhealthy connection with her boss.

Nevertheless, in spite of the aforementioned this is a great read and if some theory is delivered by the way then this is only an extra bonus.  <br />Elizabeth Ann, who spends her first years with her ever worried aunt Frances is suddenly forced to move to the Putney family she always feared of living on the farm. This is a story of a personal growth, covering all aspects of a child's life - the growth is both mental and physical and is as enjoyable as the \\"Little House in the Prairie\\" books or other books of the kind (I mention the \\"Little House\\" books as for me that's the ultimate compliment).  <br />For me the pleasure and enjoyment have to do with the portrayal of the homey life and surroundings (a good example would be the description of the main room that at first seems ugly to Betsy and then becomes the most wonderful room in the world) and especially the account of food... personally I feel this is the first thing that gives the homey feeling. Which foods are served, the way the butter is churned and how Betsy learns to sweeten the apple sauce... this is what I love.  Another major matter of enjoyment is the fast process of change in Betsy's thoughts, abilities and appearance to which the reader is a witness. Similar change happens in \\"The Secret Garden\\" where the fresh air outside coupled with hard work makes wonders. <br />My only problem comes when I did try to return to theory and to try and adopt some of it to my life with my children. Off course anyone I know wants this natural, closer to nature life. How are you going to achieve it in our modern urban life is a different question. I know that the book talks more about the way and the process then about actually churning butter but I would like to churn a little myself... <br />There is no doubt that life in the outdoor with a lot of physical activity does wonders to your body and soul, especially when small children are concerned. <br /> <br />	2005-09-01
US	43044046	R3ROU2X9L3SJWS	0399241620	402404091	Olivia Kidney and The Exit Academy	Books	5	0	0	N	N	One of a kind masterpiece. A totally different and unique read.	This is such a good book, I feel it would be a waste to aim it at children only; neither do I think that children will understand all the many nuances, the richness and fullness of Ellen Potter's mixture of reality hardships, life and death issues, imagination and philosophical ideas.  Off course, this is why this is such a good children book - because it has so many layers and can be experienced differently at every age.  <br />\\"Olivia Kidney\\" was such a surprise, both wonderful and painful at the same time. This book is the second in what (hopefully) becomes a series and is no less interesting or elevating then the first. In fact I do believe that Ellen Potter outdid herself and reached new heights... I sound a little pompous but besides truly loving the book I feel the author also bravely dealt with a difficult issue.   <br />The main story is about Olivia and her father, moving, once again, to a new place. Olivia is used to this routine but she never expected to arrive to such an amazing house and to meet such strange people. Olivia and her father arrive at the house of Ansel Pover and his assistant, the lovely Nora, but this is only the cover to several side stories entangled into a wide tale with some very coherent messages.  Great characters (some of whom we met in the previous book) join Olivia in her journey to understand...  <br />In the first book Olivia reaches some sort of acceptance with the death of her beloved brother Christopher through a very painful process involving contact with the other world. In this second book Ellen Potter chose a very direct approach to the issue of death itself. Death is a major issue here and it is not hushed aside but dealt with from many angels.   <br />From the adult side, all the ideas about death and the ways to prepare for death sound very right and wanted and it is only too bad we cannot adopt them into our lives. The book proceeds in a manner that makes you think about it in a different way every step of the way.A good example would be the show Olivia watches, about the bear attacking the woman which was perceived by me as an ironical and comical tale about the relationship of an unfit couple. The ending was understood as a sort of awful \\"punishment\\" the wife receives for dragging her husband to the woods; then the story moves on and we now know this was only a death rehearsal and our whole perception changes.  <br />I found this book to be very comforting and lovely in the sense that it looks death directly in the eye and makes it less intimidating.  Ellen Potter has created all the technical devices to help you struggle: the animal, the repetitions, the preparations. I loved the idea of a death script that needs to be rehearsed  <br /> <br />We can only hope that Ellen Potter knows more then us and some of what she tells about is true.  <br />	2005-08-31
US	43044046	R30GVKAMAHKGP	0394891767	83480017	The Witchcraft of Salem Village (Landmark Books)	Books	5	19	19	N	N	A very good preface to the subject of the Salem witchcraft trials	There were two reasons for my interest in this book; one is the fascinating issue of the Salem Witchcraft trials, a subject that has intrigued me for years (I first encountered this topic while reading articles dealing with matters of child testimony in court and children eyewitness in general) and the second is the writer, Shirley Jackson, whose work I try to read in full.  <br />It is no wonder Shirley Jackson has chosen to write about this chapter in American history. Shirley Jackson, as her biography notes, was interested not only in witchcraft and the supernatural, but more in the power of the community, especially a small one, on an individual person. Jackson experienced this power as an evil force and she describes it as such in her work (a good example would be the book \\"We have always lived in the castle\\"). Several efforts were made to link Jackson's personal life with her work. After reading much of her work and biography one realizes how she must have sympathized with the accused in the Salem Witchcraft Trials, as a person who was also an outcast or a \\"strange\\" member of the community. It seems that the issue of the Salem Witchcraft Trials was more then just an historical chapter for Shirley Jackson. <br />But beyond the author herself, this is a description of a dead end situation for those wrongly accused of witchcraft and nothing they may possibly do could prove them innocent. Jackson does well in her effort to describe the political and religious atmosphere of the time before getting to the story itself.  This is the horrible tale of a group of girls, who in their fear for themselves wrongly accuse other people in witchcraft. One event leads to another and pretty soon they are many steps beyond return. The atmosphere of the time enabled such misdeeds to happen. <br />As the book is intended for kids, the language and terminology are rather simple, yet Jackson manages to be clear and precise and does not let her thoughts and feelings (which we can onlyimagine) evade the writing. Even though Jackson describes the wrongdoings she does not dwell on the suffering of the accused when blamed, in prison, or the after come of the hanging itself. Jackson tries to stick to the historical details and facts and gives an objective description of the events themselves. However, Jackson does not wish to leave her historical story to mere facts, as facts are rather scarce in this case. The author tries to supply reasons and semi-explanations as to how something as terrible as this could have happened. Besides the court summaries, names and details of living people there are no real facts to hang on to, and what could be the facts in this case? The mere facts were only the tales and actions of the \\"Afflicted children\\" and the atmosphere in the country during the time of the Salem trials.  <br />I found the book very clear and interesting although as an adult I feel I would like to further dwell into this issue. This is a good job of describing the episode to children ( I believe the readers age should be above the age of 10-11 and definitely not ages 4-8 as recommended in the product description!) with an effort to remain as neutral as possible, as much as can be done in such a story.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-16

This is totally unclear. Is this a modern fairy tale? If so, some \\"magic\\" is missing, Criticism of the high society coupled with mother daughter relations? and if so, I believe children are unlikely to grasp it. Or maybe this is just a funny girl story? Which in case I have to say - not funny enough.  <br />Molly's magic dress is old and torn but is loved by Molly and is believed by Molly to be magical.... As an adult reader I am not sure the dress is truly magical or is only a vehicle for Molly's imagination (Molly is quite lonely and therefore it is easy to believe that all the magic is in her mind), but this is irrelevant to the plot.  Molly's mother, another major character is portrayed as a person you would instantly hate with all your might. This, I confess, does not happen as before she is presented by language and drawing you read that when Molly is away \\"she always missed her mother\\". This soft sentence, together with something comical about the mother, somehow makes you better prepared to patiently swallow the mother's platinum hair, slim figure and fashionable clothing, as later presented by the drawings, together with her fashionable change of decoration and the many unlikable comments about her (\\"Molly's mother liked clothes, and clothes liked her right back\\"...). <br />The magic dress accompanies Molly to a boring wedding where she meets all her stuffy relatives (the great aunts discussing a woman named Bunny and the young cousins discussing  someone named Muffin) and it is on this phase the story shifts into a very preachy/educational tone featuring a homeless lady who is just the opposite of the beautiful mother. The magic dress helps Molly rescue the homeless lady in what seems to be very bizarre proceedings of events where magic and reality are no longer differentiated. By the end of the story we have themother's sudden understanding that Molly is very lonely... but it is a little unclear how this came about.  <br />It seems that the drawings, which are funny (check out the mother's see through dress) and rich with details save the story from being a total let down, but only adults are able to understand the author's side hints and criticisms. Above all, author intentions are totally misunderstood.  <br />	2005-07-26

This is the third book of the \\"No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency\\" series and some of the novelty is starting to run down. Also comes the realization, that this is more a book about Africa and its people then about solving crimes. The mysteries, so it seems, are just a side issue to the story. This fact was indeed quite clear after the first book and I confess it did not and does not bother me; Africa is an interesting enough subject to hold a story.  I also appreciate the choice of lady detective and \\"mystery\\" as a means to unfold the tales of the African people. My criticism however is with the easy way in which the issues and problems (these are not really crimes) are solved. It seems that this gets easier from one book to the next. If solving crimes is the method you choose, then maybe you should try a little harder. It seems a little far-fetched to believe that all servants and maids confide with Mma Ramotswe and her secretary and actually hand them the answers they look for on a silver platter. Also a little disappointing that the issue of the boy with the \\"lion smell\\" presented in such an intriguing way in the beginning of the book is discarded later on with no more then a few sentences (although I did appreciate the clever conversation between Mma Ramotswe and Mma Potokwane).  <br />In this book we again follow Mma Ramotswe, our regular heroine and her faithful secretary (now promoted to the position of Assistant Detective and even acting manager of the garage) Mma Makutsi who proves to be a wonder woman. Not only she proves herself to be a great detective but also appears to hold great knowledge of cars and a lot of self-confidence.  <br />Another problem is that many of the issues return again and seem to be a little overused. A good example would be mentioning, again, for the 100th time that Mma Ramotswe is a \\"traditionally built\\" woman. OK, we understood that. It seems that the writer wants to make his point again and again.  <br />And yet, after I have spilled all my criticism, I must say that the story is a nice and easy read and the current problems of Africa are presented with a love that comes out of every sentence. Mma Ramotswe is no doubt an incredible character and I can only assume that I will also buy the next book of the series, if only to find out how is Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni and his adopted children.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-26

There is a dark secret, a shadow over her life. She has no mother, no friends and no nice clothes to wear. If she has any good looks, nor she nor the readers know about it. Above all, Lily is not loved by her father, the only person left in her life. What makes Lily go on in this dreary life? Maybe it is the memory of the first four years of her life when she was loved, or the hope for a change in her father's attitude. The readers start the story of Lily and wait with her for her moment of glory and revelation, the moment where she will be discovered and loved. We know with great confidence that she will be discovered for sure, but this very confident knowledge seems to be one of the story's problems.<br /><br />This is a very nice book whose power stems from Lily's sympathy-capturing situation, the quite interesting subject of bees (I liked the Bee parts in the beginning of every chapter, the description of the bee's lives and the effort to parallel it with Lily's life) and the great, bigger then life, black women characters. I for example am a sucker for women stories and for characters such as the black August Boatwright. Give me a good gospel scene and I am done for. This is exactly what happens in this story; we get just the right mixture of women sisterhood (above color or age), myth and culture, historical facts and key sentences - a mix that is bound to win our hearts. There are however, many flaws to this mingle; the story is rather interesting but I kept having the feeling that I know exactly what to anticipate and how the story will end. Its like the story follows a certain pattern and there are no surprises. All in all the story seems to be something you have already read or heard...a lonely child, a weird aunt or uncle ... and the climax scene, the moment of understanding it all..<br /><br />There are so many \\"just on time\\" coincidences in the story they are just too hard to believe. A good example would be the part where Lily saves Rosaleen from jail, smuggling her out of hospital in a scene that we might meet in an action movie such as \\"Die Hard\\" or the kind where the hero rises above all obstacles. The story, by the way, seems like a perfect fit for a movie and I do hope this is not what was on the author's mind while writing this book.<br /><br />A nice book but definitely not a masterpiece.ory they are just too hard to believe.

Surprisingly, as you move along in your reading of \\"These Foolish things\\" sex is in fact quite a subject.  <br />The book starts with a story that sounds familiar - wasn't it just last winter when I read this tale in the newspapers - an old lady lying in a hospital corridor does not get treated by the medical staff and the newspapers are out, once again, to blame the system ... <br />Ravi Kapoor, the over-worked Indian doctor in charge of the elderly woman gets a lot of bad publicity. He himself knows the truth, Muriel Donnelly, the old lady, did not want to get treatment from \\"those darkies\\". This whole affair comes at a very bad time for Ravi. His father-in-law, a typical \\"dirty old man\\" is staying at his house, after being thrown, again, from another retirement home.  Here however comes the unexpected twist. Ravi's cousin comes out with a genius idea: move a group of British senior citizens, just like Ravi's father-in-law to India where labor is cheap and elders are treated with respect, and create a Little England in India. The old folks will never know the difference. The cousin is very convincing, he knows just the right place and the right people to manage the establishment...he is a man who dwells on \\"arranging\\". What if the ends are not loosely tied...Ravi is captured in his enthusiasm.  <br />This is a story about old age but also about personal revelation and self discovery that sometimes need the mediation of a different place. This is what India manages to do in this book and its influences on the group of elderly people and one doctor is the essence of this lovely story. <br />Deborah Moggach is funny and gives you a very detailed and understandable description. You feel you have met, at least once in your life,  most of the characters she talks about, although they are not stereotypes. Moggach presents a host of characters that is about to occupy the Indian retirement home and brings each personal story - then we read about them in their new home, far far away...or maybe not?  <br />I give the story 4 out of 5 points as the story is interesting, even educational, and very entertaining. It does tend however to slip towards some very easy soap opera solutions. I have to say that the story is comforting in the sense it is filled with a lot of vivacity and life force and there is (almost) nothing of the despair of old age. On the other hand, this is also the reason why the story is not totally convincing. Nevertheless, quite lovely.        <br />	2005-04-15
US	43044046	R1CDZIVUUTHB70	0449904059	44005053	Private Demons: The Life of Shirley Jackson	Books	5	46	46	N	N	A life of contradictions	She never states her reasons but I assume what made me buy this book are the same reasons that drew the writer, Judy Oppenheimer, to write about Shirley Jackson. It is an effort to try and understand the mind and influences behind such masterpieces as the \\"Lottery\\", \\"We have always lived in the castle\\" or \\"Hangsaman\\". Was she mad? Was she full of fears? What were the influences which worked upon her? Did she - could she - have a normal family life? and how in god's name did she think of all these ideas, were they based on her personal experience?  <br />This is a very good read, partly because of the intriguing heroine and partly due to the good writing (quite dramatic at times). The bottom line is that I did get the answers  <br />  to most of my questions. This is a very thorough life story, which even continues after Jackson's untimely death, telling us what happened to all the major people in her life. This account presents Shirley Jackson from every possible angel: a daughter, a wife, a mother, neighbour and friend, and a writer too - but never only a writer. A very troubled person living a life of many contradictions.  I guess I never expected her to have been a regular person.   <br />I always wonder about Biographies. Is it all true? It seems that the biographers know more about the person then he knew about himself. We read about Jackson's most intimate details of life (Stanley and Shirley's first night together is just one example), about her inner most thoughts. I believe that the author has had to develop her own theories or choose among the options that were given to her by the many close people surrounding Shirley Jackson (\\"she made good friends\\", was one of the things Judy Oppenheimer says about Jackson in her final notes). The writer however presents many seemingly \\"open\\" issues as facts. A good example would be the true meaning of Jackson's famous story \\"The Lottery\\". There are several versions regarding the creation of this story, a few of them given by Jackson herself. Oppenheimer presents all versions but claims that the \\"the Lottery\\" was the purest, most direct expression to Jackson's knowledge of human evil and the painful awareness of anti-Semitism she has acquired over the years. Another example could be Shirley and Stanley marriage which was full of contradictions (he always remained \\"the important figure\\" around the house), and many infidelities from Stanley's side. One says you can never tell what goes on between a couple but Oppenheimer seems to be quite confident of her conclusions. I am quite sure she had her sources to term her hypothesis as facts. At other times the writer chooses to take a neutral stand. For example, was Shirley's marriage to Stanley \\"her greatest fortune or her worst calamity\\"? we are left to decide for our own. <br />The book is filled with little details and is based upon dozens of interviews (Jackson's children are a major source). The writer states comments and references made by a host of friends and relatives - no aspect of Jackson's life is left untouched. We learn what she ate, what she drank - how much she drank. What she thought about each of her children, the fights she had with her friends. We learn about her many illnesses, about her high points and her many breakdowns. How her house looked, what she collected - the list is infinite. <br />Most interesting however are the connections made between he books she wrote and the life she led. Jackson's art was always close to her real life. This connection reached its climax in the book \\"We have always lived in the castle\\" - the solution Jackson finds for her heroines is the one she found for herself.   Constance and Merricat end living in the castle made to become a fortress, never again leaving it to go out. This was just what happened to Jackson in the time following the publication of the story. This book has also been her reaction to the feeling of withdrawal and rejection she received from the village people amongst which she lived (This is the way I felt every day, she claims). Constance and Merricat were also a portrayal of two parts of herself, and reflected her two daughters. Each book and its major similarities with the life and problems she faced at the time.  <br />At first I used this book more as a reference book I used it to look up Jackson's stories and the books I read through the years.  Sort of like comparing or checking my understanding of the story with what the experts says. I was also interested to hear what were the reviews and reactions to these books and stories, especially the ones I liked best.  <br />The story of Jackson life however is too interesting to put down and at times seems as strange and creepy as her books. A very recurrent motif in her books is the battle of the mind itself. This is a motif recurrent in her life too.   <br />I never thought that Jackson's stories were real \\"horror\\". They are a very candid portrayal of the evil of human kind.  It is interesting to note that a really \\"bad\\" character, a murderer in fact, is the very likable heroine of \\"We have always lived in the castle\\". Again an example of Jackson's contradictions. <br />A very interesting book aimed at Jackson's fans or those who appreciate her work.    <br />	2005-04-13
US	43044046	R3QBWFIZMH12ME	0877958335	993612400	The Bird's Nest	Books	5	15	15	N	N	Shirley Jackson Advanced	My favorite Shirley Jackson book has always been \\"We have always lived in the Castle\\". However, although \\"The Bird's nest\\" was only Shirley Jackson's third novel, it is, so I feel, \\"Shirley Jackson - advanced course\\". This is an elaborate story which incorporates all classic Jackson fingerprints and yet involved a research and a unique way of writing. A seemingly \\"normal\\" story (at least this is how it starts...) that somehow turns - the moment cannot be precisely captured - into a haunting, creepy tale. This is a book you read and have to keep going back and checking once and again for the hints you seemed to miss in your reading.  You understand the words but do not always understand why regular words give you such an uncomfortable feeling. This is by the way is a feeling which is very familiar to Jackson's readers. Also, the overall sense is that a secret clouds the whole story and that if you would have paid more attention and read more attentively, maybe you could have figured this one out, as Jackson always seems to leave hints along the way.  The body of Miss R., a niece to Aunt Morgen and a patient of Dr. Wright (the two other main characters of the story) is a \\"bird's nest \\" to four conflicting characters, each one a different person with a different character, and even different facial expressions (the Dr. can tell who is standing in front of him even before she speaks). All these four personalities are fighting for dominance over the \\"awareness\\" of the young girl. The story is told in a way I never met in Jackson's books, where each chapter presents the story from a different angel, although only Doctor Wright speaks in his own narrative voice. The other chapters present one main character but from a side look.  <br />The battle is always, as with Shirley Jackson, with one's mind, a subject that interested her immensely. Like Natalie from \\"Hangsaman\\" who imagines/befriends the \\"girl Tony\\" (and the reader keeps asking himself if she is true or just fictitious), and like \\"The haunting of hill house\\" where we learn, maybe too late, that the real battle is what goes inside the mind of the heroine, in the \\"Bird's nest\\", the battle is over the mind of Elizabeth R.  <br />It is the goal of Dr. Wright (and the reader) to understand the source of this personality split. Interesting to note that this battle or conflict is, according to the famous psychologist Erik Erikson, the crisis appropriate to the age of young adulthood. Erikson describes this crisis as \\"Intimacy vs. Isolation\\" and declares that the most important events of this stage are love relationships. You are not developmentally complete until you are capable of intimacy, but an individual who has not developed a sense of identity usually will fear a committed relationship and may retreat into isolation.   <br />A split of one person and the constant battle between being complete or separate, close or withdrawn is thus a recurrent motif in Shirley Jackson (Constance the homey and Merricat the bold in \\"We have always lived in the castle\\", Natalie and the girl Tony, etc.). In the \\"Bird's nest\\" however Jackson seems to have taken this issue one step further. She was fascinated with the subject of multiple personalities and therefore has made a serious research before writing this book. Her research has convinced her for example that a multiple personalities case needed to have an act of sexual abuse as its cornerstone. She therefore installed the hints of such act with the description of Robin, about which Betsy tells the man in the restaurant.  <br />There are many layers to this story, nothing is ever really clear and the story can be analyzed in many different ways. Also very interesting to understand the story in light of Shirley Jackson's personality and her fascination with the subject, a fascination that her biographers claim to stem from her feeling that she herself had several personalities within. <br />Basically the story is read as a thriller. You want toread further on as you have to know what will happen next and what personality will gain ownership of Miss R. For me the reading has also been another stage of my learning and admiration of this powerful author.  It seems that with every book you get a little closer to further understanding this elaborate mind. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-04-09
US	43044046	R1616U8YECV9RS	0394714563	562333593	The Grubbag:  An Underground Cookbook	Books	3	7	7	N	N	An underground cookbook. Practical philosophical & political	This book, dating back to 1971, began as a food column carried out by the Liberation News Service, the news service of the underground press. Ita Jones, the writer, used this platform to express her opinion just about everything; food, so she felt,  is such an integral part of our lives, that dealing with it, is dealing with history, politics, philosophy, love, revolution, war and peace... This is the notion behind this book and what makes it so unique. \\"Some have referred to what you're holding as a cookbook...,\\" she writes, but is really uncertain how to define her writing. <br />No doubt this is no regular cookbook. <br />There are many recipes here entangled in a mass of associations and thoughts - these have a truly \\"underground\\" air to them. Something which can be described as \\"anti  establishment\\" on the one hand and yet cherishing some very \\"traditional\\" and homey aspects of life. Real food, not gourmet or \\"toyish\\" stuff, food to help you live happy and healthy but not something that is first and foremost intended to feed.  This book therefore does not offer only vegetarian cooking as could be assumed from the \\"hippie\\" atmosphere. Ita Jones writes about meat in the same manner she writes about casserole, salads, blintzes and water. The recipes can all be described as home cooking, with many influences - Jewish, eastern, etc. A good example of Jones kind of writing can be found in the chapter named \\"Curry and the dream of India\\" where Ita Jones moves from Columbus to De Castro theory about the heavy use of spices in Asia, to Curry, imperialism, the caste system in India and again to Curry and its variations. In two short pages she manages to insert history, general knowledge, politics and food. <br />My favorite chapter is the very simple one about sandwiches with some very common (but forgotten) fillings and others which are uncommon but good. This includes Sardine Filling, Tuna and Apple filling, Egg Filling. etc. I also like the chapter named \\"Kugel for the road\\" which she suggest to cut into squares, wrap each square in cellophane and place on a plate by the door.   <br /> <br />	2005-02-08
US	43044046	R3ET7VUBIM5DNC	1930900244	57666627	The Brothers Lionheart	Books	5	59	59	N	N	Belongs to the canon of best books	The first two chapters of this wonderful book were so overwhelmingly sad I almost choked while reading them aloud to my son. A mother's greatest fears come alive in these chapters and at some points I could not believe I was reading a children's book. While the rest of the story is a little less sad (at least on its apparent side) it works on our deepest fears, mainly loosing a loved one, being alone. These however are my observations as an adult. I am sure my son's perceptions are not similar at all and that as an adult I feel this book in a different level.  <br />I enjoyed reading the other reviewers that describe their memory of reading this book as children. My experience was different, having read this book for the first time slowly, for several weeks, aloud to my son. My feelings are thus those of a grownup and maybe this makes this book even sadder to me (I do not want to plunge into the discussion of should children know how sad the world is - I have no good answer). In any case this is a marvelous adventure book for all ages whose power stems from many aspects. For me it was mainly the candid descriptions of the narrator, Scotty, who regards himself as a coward and who is moved to great acts of courage by his love to Jonathan, his beautiful, brave and kind brother. The love for Jonathan is really Scotty's driving force. <br />The book really belongs to the canon of best children books ever. On the first level this is an adventure book. The good: a beautiful hero, who always seems to know the right words, a fight for freedom, acts of bravery and self-sacrifice. The evil: a cruel leader, always finding new horrible ways of torture, demonic creatures, treachery and deceit. On the second level this fight for freedom is taking place in a mystical world-beyond who has another world-beyond, a notion that is both scary and comforting (there is always where to go but it seems the problems never end). On yet another level I felt the story works on our deepest fears:death, oppression, darkness, monsters, loneliness and separation from your loved ones which are really the most important aspect of life or of living. I am thinking to myself that maybe the message is that death is better if you stay with your loved ones? is this too horrible to think?  <br />The reading therefore can be pleasing, emotional and thought provoking for different ages and is remembered a long while after the reading.  <br />. <br />	2005-01-18

On this book (which I have been holding - believe it or not - for 30 years) Topsy and Tim are going on Holiday with their parents. This book is really the tale of their \\"on the way\\" adventures in the English countryside, that appeal to every toddler (or is it \\"tiddlers\\" as Topsy and Tim's British dad calls his children on the first page?). Trip starts with a misfortune, known oh so well to every parent - when Topsy and Tim realize they have forgotten their buckets behind. The crying and sobbing (accompanied by the very beautiful pictures in the old edition) are enough to deliver the situation and get the identification of every reader (be it mother or child, both understand the situation, each from his own side). <br />Mother is as clever as always and manages to suggest food in order to save the day and the family stops for a picnic. Some more adventures follow, car goes into a ditch and is saved by a man (\\"a friendly giant\\") with his tractor - and in the end, as you guessed correctly, seaside buckets are safely found.  <br />    <br />	2005-01-18

Topsy and Tim always remain around 5-6 years of age (they never grow up), are always dressed the same and live with their mother and father in a very English environment, including the proper tea time (with drawings that make you wish for such tea yourself). The content of the series has changed over time and the new books deal with issues made to fit our modern era. Topsy and Tim newer books deal with a visit to the dentist, an airplane trip, environment issues, safety, etc. However the first books deal mainly with everyday life and little issues that are of more interest (so I believe) to the very young readers. These first books (edited around 1970) also enjoy beautiful drawings which were changed over the years. <br />My edition of \\"Topsy and Tim's Monday Book\\" goes back to 1970 and I believe I myself have been holding this book for over 30 years. Now I tell this story to my 3 year old boy which seems to like this book as much as I did.  <br />It is really the lovely drawings that are so wonderful to tell the story by and the simple funny scenes. The milkman (a concept which is very foreign and hard to explain to my child) is a regular visitor and so are other characters, such as Tony Welch, a friend of the twins that always seems to get into trouble. The Monday book tells the story of a rainy Monday when Topsy and Tim are supposed to go to school wearing their Wellington boots. Tim has a tantrum (accompanied by a picture most enjoyable to the mother and son reading the book - of Tim stomping his feet in the living room) and refuses to wear his boots: \\" he was very naughty and stamped and shouted \\"I don't want my Wellingtons\\"... and dad saying \\"It's time that boy learned a lesson\\" (which off course he does!). The ending is always good and \\"Topsy and Tim plodged through all the big puddles on the way home. \\"Good oldWellington boots!\\" said Tim. <br />Lovely. <br /> <br />	2005-01-18

However, whereas Persepolis 1 centered on a childhood in Iran, this story seems to go out of the borders of Iran. By this I do not mean only the physical aspect of Marjane moving to another country. The very detailed-specific individual story in Persepolis 1 (which then could have been the sad story of a whole nation) seems to become at times, a very cosmopolite tale of growing up, facing all the problems of our era. Sex, drugs, love, friendships and relations of all kinds, hypocrisy, being true to yourself - all are thrown at your face in a concentrated manner.  <br />Marjane Satrapi bears her soul to us.  She gives us her life, thoughts and dark secrets. She even gives us nasty comic-relief remarks about different people (she does seem certain that she will never meet them again). All is presented to the reader in what becomes a very condensed experience touching so many difficult issues that the reader is not at all surprised by Marjane's breakdown. At the end of Persepolis 1 Marjane left Iran to go to Vienna in what promised to be an escape to a better life. This book centers on her life in Vienna and her return to Iran after four years in Europe. These are the teen-age years where one's personality is shaped up. Marjane has already dealt with war and death in her younger years and now has to deal with teen-age life away from home. This proves to be an experience that is no less difficult then the former. <br />Using very simple black and white sketches Marjane paints a picture of her growing self. Her disproportionate body and the large beauty mark next to her nose that soon becomes her trademark. This is one of her very unique characteristics: she does not beautify anything - on the other hand, everything seems to be centered on showing the reader how bad it was. How crazy the world felt when you are considered modest and an outsider in one place and liberated and again an outsider in another. \\"I experience a great lack of affection,\\" says Marjane to a boy she likes and the reader does not know whether to laugh or cry from his reaction.  <br />In spite of its heavy nature the book is a fast easy read. The reader is drawn to the tale and wants to know how Marjane survived the experiences she has undergone. <br />I loved the joke/story of the soldier returning from the front told to Marjane by her friend Kia which is one of the best parts of the story and holding a lot of the nature of her story - a comically told dark story.  <br />	2004-12-01

Truly this beautiful collection of stories should have received 5 points based on the writer's talent and her writing that is so earthy and real on the one hand and so high level on the other, but if I judge the book according to my personal pleasure then I am not sure...  <br />There is no doubt that this book is very well written, beautiful and candid and touches many modern, relevant subjects leading to the resolution (this is what I felt the writer was telling me) that all can be bore if only you have someone to share it with. Be it a mother, a lesbian girlfriend, a lover helping you suffer your Parkinson. I like this resolution and I think there is something very comforting about it. <br />My ambivalence stems from the fact that Amy Bloom seems to be constantly checking our boundaries. Many reviewers have already noted that all the characters in this collection suffer from a certain misfortune, be it a sickness of the self or a loved one. I do not think that this exactly is what bothered me but rather with Amy Bloom's going over the edge and maybe crossing a few red lines - such as a sexual encounter between stepmother and son, Julia and Lionel. This one encounter which never repeated itself, has left its marks on both the characters lives and is sufficient to unsettle the reader. Julia, the stepmother was my most beloved character in the book and yet the story is quite disturbing. <br />I found myself very uncomfortable with the first story bearing the collection name. Not because I am opposed to change of sex but because the story was painful for me to read both from the mother's side of having to see your daughter being so unhappy until the point of maiming herself and both from the physical aspect when I imagined the details of the operation. This story has also led me to ask myself several uneasy questions such as why am I more comfortablereading about cancer pain then about the pain of a sex-change operation? I guess the answer lies in the fact that the deformation of the self was hard for me to take. Amy Bloom has the reader sympathy for all her characters no matter what is their illness or misfortune, but I am not sure that this is a book I would want to read again in the near future. Maybe it is that stories of loss are always hard to take no matter how well they are written. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-11-30

Not tragic or sad, not comic, but somehow sour.... <br />Ann Tyler examines the subject of life choices, an issue she likes to dwell upon and was the main theme of her last book \\"When we were grownups\\". In this story she also examines love - what it is and how much of it is a question of circumstances (a certain girl walking through the door) and timing (World War II). She examines changing perspectives during a life-time, parenthood and the effect of parents relations on their children.  <br /> \\"The Amateur Marriage\\" is the story of an ordinary couple - Michael and Pauline -who were married hastily during World War II without really knowing each other. They spend the rest of their lives trying to analyze how their lives turned this way and why they keep feeling as if they did not get what they bargained for. <br />I think the quality I admire most about Anne Tyler's writing is that she sticks with \\"every day\\" and does not slide towards soapy proceedings of the story. No person or family are perfect with Anne Tyler and all characters are first and foremost human, no one is evil or totally good. Even though you beg her in your heart for one moment of sincere conversation between the couple or a revelation that could shed light on how they are feeling you do not get anything which could not have happened in real life or something you yourself are not familiar with. This includes moments of anger about the most trivial things and moments when someone feels a \\"rush of love\\" for again, trivial things. Above all, the beauty of this book is in Tyler's ability to remain (as the readers remain with her), objective and fully understanding towards her characters. She loves them both and seems to be sighing at the end of the book - \\"these are not bad people, they were just not meant for each other..\\". Nevertheless, in a way you cannot help but feel that the writer does blame the couple, otherwise, why would she call them amateurs?    <br />On the whole I love books which deal with people such as myself. This is a quick easy read which keeps coming back to you.	2004-10-15
US	43044046	RR50F6Z5EY4N7	0618197338	504177010	The Best American Short Stories 2003	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Just very good literature	This delicious short stories collection has taken me a long time to read. Not because the stories were boring or bad but since every story was so condensed, rich and powerful I could not easily part from a certain state of mind and place and move on the next story.  I try to think what are the similar features of these 2003 stories and what can they say about our time...these are very different subjects, characters and places but maybe I could say that the stories discuss a self growth of some sort. Be it a teenager boy having his first sexual encounter with a demonically bewitching mechanically doll or a person reflecting how his life has developed from a certain event as a Chinese delivery boy in the streets of New York -- but off course I guess this is a too easy generalization that can be said of any story whatsoever.  \\"Why the sky turns red when the sun goes down\\" by Ryan Harty is a good example of the stories ability to emotionally stir you up and touch an issue very relevant for parents everywhere, maybe this is what made this story so special for me. The story starts out as a very ordinary family crisis tale. The father learns that something happened to his boy and goes out to fetch him. The turning point comes when the boy is seen lying down with his hand thrown a few yards away from his body. Slowly you realize that this is a mechanical child and prepare yourself for some science fiction descriptions, which do not arrive. Apart from the very central \\"mechanical boy\\" fact this is a very real story in all its levels, with nothing \\"modern\\" or alienated about it.  By the end of the story I remained with the strong feeling that mechanical or not, the parents are facing the same questions parents everywhere are asking themselves and mainly \\"are we doing the right thing\\". How do we keep our children and families safe? What are the lies we tell our children and ourselves in order to keep us safe? \\"Why the sky turns red...\\" has the heavy atmosphere that is very characteristic of many of the other stories in this collection. Something hard and heavy is hanging above and the characters are having a hard time trying to push it away, like a certain pain that has become a part of your life. The story \\"The Bees\\" suffers (or rather enjoys?) the same heavy atmosphere, only here this is not something between husband and wife but between a man and himself. The man is in turmoil because of something in the past that clouds his present. When the punishment arrives, you accept it as the anticipation and tension has been built up all along.  I did not read the previous Best American Short stories but feel as if Walter Mosely has done an incredible job. Or maybe these fine authors have made his job easier. This is a masterpiece collection of stories.  \\"Ghost Knife\\", \\"Moriya\\", \\" Baby Wilson\\", \\"Devotion\\" and \\"Future Emergencies\\" are some of my favorite stories in this collection. Off course I can relate easily to stories which discuss women, parents or people who are in a position similar to mine, but the greatness of these stories is that you can feel the pain, helplessness and anger of people in totally different surroundings and situations, such as immigrants recalling something in their past or people from another culture all together (the stories \\"Night Talkers\\" or \\"Marie-Ange's Ginen\\" which are set in Haiti for example).  This is truly good literature and my only regret is that I cannot discuss these stories in a literature class so I can understand all the further layers.    Do not miss the last few pages of the book where every writer gives a few lines about his story and how it came through.	2004-10-15

No extra message	I love Anthony Brown books especially due to his amazing drawings. <br />In this short book (short of words, that is) it is again the drawings that do the work.  <br />Each page presents the father as another animal figure dressed in Dad's pajamas, depicting all the animal' s great qualities.  <br />The pictures are great as usual, but something is missing. It seems that there are no \\"further layers\\" as you get for example in Anthony Brown's \\"Gorilla\\", a book which I feel is a real masterpiece. In that book, every reading brings something new when the little details of the drawings offer another aspect, another small joke and all in all add to the reading of the story, which becomes a real \\"experience\\" both child and parent can enjoy. This does not really happen in \\"My Dad\\".   <br />The only \\"something else\\" I found in \\"My Dad\\" is the fact that the father, although described by the son as a superhuman figure, is presented very humanly in each page. Always in his pajamas with his unshaven face - which makes him ever so dear and easy to identify with.  <br />I read the book to my 2.5 year old son who enjoys the book and its simplistic message. My disappointment is not because this is not a worthy book. It is. I was just hoping for another masterpiece...   <br />	2004-09-22

This has become a very inspiring book for me that somehow gives legitimization to homey, comforting needs and the never accomplished wish for a perfect world... A perfect world cannot be ever achieved so a minor solution is to create a little perfection in the kitchen, a little sanctuary from the outside world.... This was the message of the book for me if it does not sound ridiculous to talk about a cook book message.  Nigela Lawson herself does not use the word perfection but instead talks about cooking what suits you. All she wants is to give you new ideas for easier cooking, new ideas to experiment with and suggestions to cooking things you never thought about (do not tell me you ever thought about cooking Ham in Coca-Cola). I know there is a very clear-cut division between the admirers and the haters of Nigela Lawson. I myself have never heard about this woman before reading the book so it was a very \\"fresh\\" experience that got me hooked and curious to watch her on television. The book is a pleasure to read and I have to confess I read it in bed for the first time. The book gives you some life philosophy besides the recipes and the added value comes with the many beautiful pictures that are a pleasure and inspiration. I also confess that maybe the life philosophy and the recipes suit someone like myself who \\"lives to eat\\" and not the other way around and is ready to work a little for this goal. Nigela Lawson makes an effort to make the recipes as easy as possible, she uses several tips and tells you when you can skip a stage, but nevertheless it should be clear that with most recipes some work is involved.  <br />As to the recipes themselves. So far I have tried 5 recipes. Four of them came out outstanding and these include the amazing chocolate fudge cake, and the soft and spicy invaltini eggplants, which have become a cornerstone of my kitchen. I also loved Grandma Lawson pastry and the Union Square spicy nuts. The fifth recipe (liftower dip) was surprisinglybanal. However, I am still on my first stages and have marked the Ham and Coca-Cola-cola as a must.  <br /> <br />	2004-09-22

After reading the first book of this series I felt I have to keep on going. After reading the second book I will not rest till I read the whole series. I admit that I am now in a better position to pinpoint several flaws which are more apparant in the second book but these have not spoiled my utter enjoyment. This is a quick read which gives you a feeling that you are not only enjoying yourself but also learning something at the same time. At least this is how I felt.   <br />In the second book the main focus is still Mma Ramotswe, but a very central part is given to her fiancee, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni (and rightly so). Maybe it is easier for the writer to enter into the mind of a man, or maybe he just really likes this guy, as the reader does. He is a kind man, and as one he is easily \\"forced\\" into a new responsibility: adopting two kids, one of them in a wheelchair. Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni fears the reaction of our heroine, but she surprises him (Mma Ramotswe reaction seemed a little \\"too good to be true\\" for this reader but things have a nice way of \\"arranging themselves\\" in this book). <br />Mma Ramotswe continues solving mysteries with the help of her loyal secretary, Mma Makutsi, now promoted into the position of Assistant Detective. However, as in the first book I felt the mysteries were not the real essence. The book is really a love song for Africa and the African people (Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni for example, wants to give Mma Ramotswe a diamond from the Botswana earth). In this book the writer continues to share with the readers (ignorant in my case) some of the African traditions, way of life, and especially their way of thought.  <br />My slight criticism is of the very easy way in which mysteries are solved. Somehow, Mma Ramotswe happens to meet the right people, to get what she wants out of them or to have the right \\"feelings\\". I confess, I do believe in intuition and especially woman intuition, but it seems that this feeling isa little over used here. Mma Ramotswe is surprised that not all people know, like she does, when someone is lying; this is very clear for her. Another issue is the very easy acceptance of feminism and modern ways in spite of a very central theme in the series of preserving the African ways and traditions, be it with Mma Ramotswe \\"traditionally built\\" body or with her thoughts how children act disrespectfully nowadays. I cannot understand how this is settled with the acceptance (even in thought) that there might be a girl mechanic (coping on a wheelchair) running the garage, aas much as I would like it to happen.  <br />A great book. Am looking forward for the third.	2004-09-19
US	43044046	R38NLBGYWUJR0Q	1400034779	405618230	The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency (Book 1)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A tribute to Africa	Surprise, Surprise. This is not a thriller as I expected but a book about life and human nature, filled with love for Africa and the African people. It seems that lately Africa has lost its \\"charm\\" in the western eyes and is now mostly related to AIDS, hunger and war. This book seems to give Africa its lost glory.  <br />Mma Ramotswe is a fat black African lady who decides, after her father's death, to open a detective agency. Mma Ramotswe is a unique lady. On the one hand she fits the description of the lonely detective operating by himself, relying on her wit (and her car's engine) only, but on the other hand she is a woman who loves human beings, gossip and secrets. Mma Ramotswe likes to summarize to herself the truth she learns about life. She enjoys little pleasures of life, such as drinking bush tea or watching cattle. She is, so I see her, a symbol of Africa herself. Precious Ramotswe had her share of grief but she is a person who grew up being loved and is thus ready to give something to the world.  <br />The book was a real pleasure. I felt it was literature of the \\"old fashioned kind\\" in the sense that this is the kind of book that takes you and teaches you of other places. You learn to see Africa through the eyes of Precious Ramotswe. You learn that not all Africans are the same (\\"Ghanaians were Mma Ramotswe's favourite people; they had a wonderful sense of humor and were almost inevitably in a good mood\\"). You see the landscape, the food, but most of all you learn about people, how they think and what they deem important. There are human traits that are similar everywhere; Mma Ramotswe has to deal with problems of cheating husbands, non-believing women and greed of many kinds. But she also has to deal with problems unique to this part of the world, such as witch craft and its dangers. Through the story of Mma Ramotswe life and the cases she needs to solve we learn not only of Africa today and its problems but also of the character of the African people.The cases are not the real essence of the story. They are merely a vehicle to tell us about life.  This is not the regular mystery story where one case is solved throughout the book. There are many small cases which are only the glue holding this lovely tale. <br /> <br />	2004-09-07

Yes, there are many people who fall for this kind of literature and I admit to be one of them.  I just love to read about food. I even liked to read different versions of Red Riding Hood as a child only due to the nice anticipation of what would the heroine have in her basket this time... Peter Mayle seems to satisfy this whim. After winning great success with his previous books and most notably the famous \\"A Year in Provence\\" he continues to write about this favorite subject. In this book he makes an effort to give us a kind of serious research of the French obsession with food, while searching one French food festival after the other, the more bizarre the better. Mayle jumps between a snail festival to a wine festival and to a frog legs festival and then ends his adventures in a glorious spa where one looses weight eating great food.  <br />I admit the book is funny, although most of its jokes center on the cultural difference between the British author and the eccentric French and their dedication to good food. However, you cannot escape the feeling that somehow Peter Mayle had a too much of a good time writing this book. He traveled around France and then did some fact checking at home. He even fills a chapter with his failed attempts to reach a blood sausage fair (my favorite chapter is the one describing the work of the mysterious Michelin critics). To call this a serious job and on our expense? This is something so different to a serious way of life ... its almost heresy.  <br />But seriously. The book has several very entertaining and interesting parts, but can also get quite tedious at times. This is not a book to read in one sitting. A good book to read while planning a trip to France some time in advance (so that reader can allowenough time to make all necessary reservations) or for lovers of food and France, who enjoy reading food descriptions. In no way is this a \\"must\\" book. This is indeed a luxury book.  <br /> <br />	2004-08-31

They do not know exactly what it was that made their fortunes \\"fall\\" but it had something to do with mother dying, father being sick and his business partner running away. This depressing information is brought about casually and is merely the background for what is about to follow - a (very funny) treasure hunt practiced upon in different ways. Dora, Oswald, Dicky, Alice, Noel and H.O. all have different plans to get to their goal, ranging from helping an elderly gentlemen in distress (absence of apparent distress is a small obstacle) to answering a newspaper ad promising 2 pounds a week earned in your spare time - and are about to systematically try out all of them.  <br />The story is told by one of the Bastable children, one that does not wish to reveal his identity. It is a great wonder therefore that Oswald gets such a favorable description...\\"Oswald put lumps of coal on the fire with his fingers, so as not to make a noise. He is a very thoughtful boy, and he did not wipe his fingers on his trouser leg as perhaps Noel or H.O. would have done...\\" <br />This is a lesser-known story of Edith Nesbit but is the first book published by her and a real masterpiece. This book is just as lovely as her more famous \\"Railway Children\\" and like that story works on both the adult and the child level. The book is full of detailed descriptions of conversations, food (very British), grave decisions and pretend play. The Bastable children do not feel miserable unless reminded and the book is a great, very amusing read. The language (which can sometimes be quite difficult for the modern reader) is, as Oswald explains, sometimes taken out of books and especially the \\"Jungle Book\\" (\\"Good Hunting\\" they wish each other). Contrary to other reviewers, I enjoyed the \\"air of another time\\" even if I did not always understand all the expressions.  <br />This is a story of children in another era, trying to entertain themselves when they cannot afford school and need to struggle alone without the presence and explanations of adults (their self made explanations to unclear expressions, such as \\"seven times removed from the queen\\" are hilarious). The story is very cosmopolite in the sense that these are really stories of human kindness and nobility in all its forms. This is something adults and children alike can share, each according to his perceptions. The story is so rich with a sense of a different time, adventure, humor and human sociology that anyone can find something to suit his heart.   <br />	2004-08-14
US	43044046	R3JTOLE4GUYD3I	0385721811	333703164	When the Emperor Was Divine	Books	5	10	11	N	N	Dry documentary account handles this difficult subject	Throughout the reading I was very concerned with the names - or rather with the lack of names in the story. There is the Father, Mother, Boy and Girl. They have no names, as if no identity. I asked myself several times why the author has chosen to do so. Isn't it true we better understand a general story concerning a disaster that happened to many people when we hear the tale and hardships of one specific individual, one family? But maybe the author wanted to stress that this is not the story of one family but of many people the author knew, and the Father, Mother Boy and Girl are just four people amongst many whose fate was similar. The family members stand as symbols to many others.  Or maybe she chose to do so in order to make the alienation and dehumanization experience more accentuated? The answer might be both. The alienation is a very central theme of this story and works also within the family as the members of the family seem to hold out a lot of feelings from each other (although they clearly love each other) as a self defense mechanism (or so I believe) and also as breaking down will not help the situation. <BR>This is a story about the fate of the Japanese Americans during World War II, when each one of them was suspected as assisting the enemy.  Although I am familiar with World War II stories this is an historical event I never heard about, which bears a bitter resemblance to the fate of Jewish people in Europe during same war. The Japanese were not sent to death camps but were closed in concentration camps from which they did not return the same people. There is clearly a large difference but the details of the earlier notices limiting the Japanese Americans actions, the long train rides where uncertainty prevails, the concentration camps - all sound like many Holocaust accounts, a fact that makes this story hard to bear.   <BR>It took me some time to understand the name &quot;When the emperor was divine&quot;, which relates to the religious belief that the Emperor is a god; a belief the American Japanese had to hide during World War II.   <BR>The fact that neither the family (the children) nor the reader knows what the father underwent during his long confinement and seperation from the family (in spite of the last part &quot;confession&quot; that can give us a few hints) makes his missing for four years stay incomplete and unexplained. The children grew up in a very vague understanding of what happened, and probably had to fill up the rest of the information by their own. I can only imagine the conflict of loyalties created after the war when the country you live in is the one responsible to your family's suffering. <BR>The power of the book is the fact that there is a shortage in overflow of emotions, which could have been a very easy way to deal with the very difficult subject. The author chose to tell her story in a dry, somewhat documentary language.  The horrors are told very subtly and in a somewhat &quot;side look&quot; fashion - &quot;she read the sign from top to bottom... she wrote down a few words on the back of a bank receipt.&quot; as if what the sign says concerns someone else and not the end of your life as you knew them. I believe that holding back your emotions is also a very Japanese way to which the author remained loyal. The language is a combination of a dry account with dreams and thoughts that sometimes turn the prose into lyrical poetry.<BR>Not an easy read but a very good historical, important account.	2004-06-28

This gives the story a large part of its charm but is also the main flaw of the book, as some of the story seems rather familiar as if you have already read or heard it in the past. <BR>As a result of his parent's unemployment, Michael and his family leave their regular secure lives and decide to sail on a trip around the world in their yacht, the &quot;Peggy Sue&quot;. The family has to learn to operate together not only as a family unit but also as a team whose members need to depend on each other's strength and skills. Michael learns to regard his parents in new different ways. The family enjoys this way of life in spite of hardships caused by &quot;life at sea&quot; which include a lot of physical inconvenience - hard work, lack of sleep, wet clothes, etc. After a few months however, the family enters a troubled period. The mother does not feel well and a storm is approaching. While his exhausted parents sleep below, Michael remains alone on board, falls to sea and is washed to a remote island. Hence starts the largest part of the story telling us about Michael's personal struggle to survive and his meeting with Kensuke who turns to be his rescuer and mentor. The remaining story centers on Kensuke's personality, his life story and Michael's miraculous rescue. <BR>My main problem with the story is that at times the story seems too familiar. Alone on a deserted island is a theme all of us have read at least a few times in this or other version. This story is different in the sense it discusses a meeting with one unique personality that affected the life of Michael for good. Kensuke's story also turns out to be, through the end, a story of a great neglect of opportunity - not that this isn't a part of life but still I am not sure that this is the lesson the author has intended us to learn. I mention this as the moral messages andthemes are inserted along the book and include family values, power of the self, protection of wild life and cruelty of men in war times and towards animals.  <BR>I must admit that I personally enjoyed the family part a lot better then the main story, which was about Michael and Kensuke on the Island. I liked the details of the family struggle and their effort to find a new meaningful way of life; This, I believe is only a personal feeling relevant to my age,being a mother of a young adolescent, and ever struggling with questions about the right way of life...	2004-06-14

I therefore hesitated before starting to read \\"the Long Secret\\", but this time I was not sorry (the right reading order should have been HTS, The Long Secret and then Sport). <BR>The long secret holds the same kind of eccentric, incredible characters as HTS. Especially lovable are Bible loving Jessie Mae, her fat brother Norman and their incredible Mama Jenkins (including their outstanding way of speech - supposedly Mississippi style).  The Long Secret also gives us a special look on Harriet as she looks \\"from the side\\". Once you see Harriet through Beth Ellen eyes, you also see all her flaws, although she remains one of a kind ...; This \\"round look\\", the ability to portray a character as a real human person with qualities and flaws is one of the writer's remarkable abilities. <BR>The heroine of this book is Beth Ellen, a shy timid person who does not talk or act a lot and is usually a very passive friend to Harriet. Beth Ellen undergoes an inner growth through this book and Harriet too learns to regard her friend in a different light. <BR>Not all of my questions were answered at the end of The Long Secret and the ending seems a little too simplistic to accept, but all in all a fun read.	2004-06-12

Dallas describes the &quot;force&quot; of this companionship in many of her books as what seems to give women power to move on in spite life hardships. One can bear a lot, as long as you have a friend to share it with. <BR>This is the story of Effa Commander from Butte, Montana who decided together with Whippy Bird, her life long friend (anyone who really knows her will never call her just Whippy) to set the record straight and tell the truth about May Anna Kovaks and Buster Midnight, their third best friend, a famous movie star and her high school sweet heart, a boxing champ.<BR>Sandra Dallas draws a tale who takes a while getting into, but once inside you get hooked. We accompany the &quot;unholy three&quot; along the important stages of their lives where they remain faithful, caring and non-judgmental towards each other. <BR>Sandra Dallas is an expert in capturing and transforming characters - tones of speech, expressions, voices and places. The real pleasure however is not really the story of May Anna and her success but the &quot;simple&quot; life story of the long friendship between Effa Commander and Whippy Bird. There is something very reassuring and comforting about the story of this friendship and the ability to see it stable and unchanging through the years. I believe that this and Dallas bitter - sweet writing ability are really what makes the charm of this book.	2004-05-27

I was hooked to the first pages who offer something unique and different - a good look into the mind of a nine year old girl. It seems that all parents spend time in one stage or another discussing the issue of how their children think... here is a serious effort to answer this question. Although Nory seems at times like a too mature person (with too-good-to be true parents) who spends a lot of time dwelling about \\"heavy\\" issues (she is very concerned with the way Achilles mother held him while dipping his body into the river and not - as Nory thinks would have been better, by cradling him in her arms and stepping into the water with him), but also about subjects I am more familiar with from my kids such as problems with other children, nightmares and trying to be \\"a good girl\\". All in all Nicholson Baker does give us pretty good directions. However, once the thrill is over, and the appreciation to Nicholson Baker's genius (no sarcasam here) wears out, you are left with a somewhat tedious feeling. This happened to me around middle book where I realized this book is taking me forever to finish and I had to struggle through the rest of the book wishing that something would finally happen or that the book would end already. The story could have been interesting had it centered around Nory's social life at school and the many problems it presents - especially Nory's relations with Pamela, a very unpopular girl which Nory seems to like. These parts and the real life conflict they present are indeed interesting but the story is filled with the many stories Nory invents - which are, to say the truth, not so interesting for an adult. It is like the feeling you have after spending too much time with your kids... you do love them, but sometimes you crave for an adult conversation.	2004-05-10
US	43044046	RY3MU5S6ITPAI	0440418186	399405180	Sport	Books	3	11	13	N	N	Not more then OK	It was a great pleasure to discover that Louise Fitzhugh has written two more books besides \\"Harriet the Spy\\" which is one of the greatest children books ever. As an adult I was thrilled to be able to reunite with all the great characters and especially with Sport, one of \\"Harriet the Spy\\" most beloved characters. This book however, was quite a let down. Not a total disappointement, as some of the parts do hold part of the magic ( I for example loved the part where Sport looks around the table to check all the good foods prepared by Kate) but not in a way that is able to overcome the flaws of this book. <BR>I believe the best thing about \\"Harriet the Spy\\" was the fact that the characters, and especially the heroine were so unique - they were something you have never met before. There was never any heroine quite like Harriet and all the events of her tale are new and refreshing (at least in the way these events and  happenings are interpreted by the heroine). This feeling does not exist when reading about Sport. The characters do not capture your heart in the same way because their portrayal is somewhat corny and stereotyped. You do feel you have read something similar before. This is especially true of Sport's mother and her sister which are as \\"bad\\" as bad can be and are therefore totally uncredible. One finds it hard to believe that the mother, even if she was acting out of pure greed would not at least try to win her son's heart or act so stupidly. I did expect characters which are rounder figures and not just \\"evil\\" - as the mother (did she have to look evil on the outside too?), or \\"good\\" as the new stepmother appears to be. The friends are also portrayed in the same manner and in spite of Fitzhugh's effort to inject some social issues (the policemen are after the black kid) the book does not rise above the level of an OK story.	2004-05-05

Maybe cosmopolite is not the right terminology as this is clearly a very feminine, white, upper middle-class account; however cosmopolite in the sense that in varying nuances this is a human life story that can be similar to the lives of many of us. As if the narrator is saying: this is how I became myself. If you were to recount to someone what where the major stages of your personal development, what influenced you as a teen ager, who did you look up to as a role model, when did you learn to be assertive, etc. you might have come up with an account whose essence was similar to this book (although definitely not in the same talent).<BR>Every story in this collection is a stand-alone and yet together they give us the growing up history of Jane Rosenhal.I see Jane as the classic modern heroine. She is not attractive and is very concerned with the question of feminine beauty. Like many of us she is weakened in front of beautiful people. She is smart and talented but does not feel she is exceptionally talented and maybe she isn't. Although the reader is unable to truly assess Jane' abilities he knows she is a hard worker in both her work and personal lives and a very direct funny person, whenever she can be herself. We learn how Jane learns to react to the world according to her experiences with the  different people around her: lovers, boyfriends, family members, boss.   <BR>Jane has strong family bonds. In one of the best parts of the books she comes to the sad realization that she will never find a man that will love her the way her father did and this is a very hard notion to grasp.<BR>This is also a story of a very healthy growing up environment. The heroine has received a lot of love from her parents and brother and in a way she has some strong solid base to build upon. <BR>The first story happens at the time when Jane was about fourteen. The story centers around Henry, Jane's beloved brother and his relationship with his new girlfriend, all as captured through Jane eyes. She understands the situation but finds herself more understanding towards the woman side of this relationship. In this episode we also get familiar with the good family relations of Janes family, which nevertheless do not ensure that they will not bring her discomfort or pain in feeling that she might disappoint her family in choosing her partners. I liked all the stories /parts of the big story, but have to add that I was a little disappointed from the last story, bearing the name of the book (Girls guide to fishing and hunting) that is a little too predictable (in its outcome) although very easy to identify with (is there anyone out there who did not question the used advice of &quot;just be yourself&quot;?)<BR>I enjoyed every part of this sincere touching book.	2004-04-12

When starting a new Sandra Dallas book there is always the very solid (reassuring) knowledge that you are heading for a pleasant treat. &quot;Not a book that would change your life&quot; as one reviewer commented, but truly pure enjoyment. This was indeed my feeling during the reading of this book and after ending it I was sorry to part from these colorful spicy characters. Let me also add that the experience was rather short, as Dallas books are always a fast read.<BR>The Chili Queen is not different from Dallas other books in the sense that here again we get a close look on mostly women characters of the West, their daily life and struggles. However, whereas Dallas always centers around women sisterhood, portraying most often one personal woman world (&quot;Alice Tulips&quot;, &quot;The diary of Mattie Spencer&quot; and &quot;The Persian Pickle Club&quot;) among other secondary characters, in this book the scope is broadened to give us two women and a man as the main characters, and all of them are quite unique, nothing of the ordinary folks we see in her other stories.<BR>This is the story of Addie, a Madam in a small whorehouse in Nalgitas who meets a woman named Emma on the train. Emma seems a pathetic creature, about to marry a man she has never seen before. Although Addie's life has not been without hardships she has not lost her kindness and when Emma is dumped by her future husband she takes her into her home. The tale gets more complicated but I would not like to add a thing so as not to ruin the reader's enjoyment (several reviewing comments I read in the beginning of the book were enough to ruin some of the pleasure for me) . <BR>My copy ends with a list of questions for Reading Groups - among them the question &quot;which character did you most want to find peace and happiness?&quot; this question, so I feel, touches the main flaw of this book. Dallas herself seems to like her characters too much and wants them all to find &quot;peace and happiness&quot;. This is evident in the human, kind portrayal of all her four characters but is also the problem of this book as this is not always the way life works.<BR>Full of charm and understanding of human nature.	2004-04-02

There are many things to like about this book: the large eccentric family (where the eccentric uncle fits like a glove), the very rich drawings that have you checking details on every page, and the interesting different story which seems to appeal to all ages. <BR>There are many things to look for when reading the book together and our favorite page seems to be the one showing Uncle Andy's house \\"which is like an amusement park\\". What occupies us is our search for the twenty-five cats (\\"all named Sam\\"). Mysteriously we can only find twenty-four cats and are still looking for the missing Sam. We also have many other questions and wonders such as \\"Can't Bubba cook anything other then Salami and Cheese\\"? (that's the mother asking) and \\"What job did Uncle Andy assign to the young members of the family\\"? (that's the child asking). <BR>The story has a very inherent artistic philosophy (art is everywhere and can be found everywhere) which is very easily understood by children and seems to perfectly suit their way of thinking.

This careful background research makes this book (as her previous &quot;Girl with Pearl Earring&quot; and &quot;Falling Angels&quot;) educating as well as entertaining. The book is a very easy read and the different narrating voices add to its appeal and to the reader's ability to feel for the characters. The book cover (in the copy I hold) is splendid, portraying a detail of &quot;Portrait of a girl&quot; attributed to Domenico Ghirlanaio and a detail of the &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn&quot; tapestry, both of which are so wonderful to look at, that for me it added yet another important layer to the reading. &quot;Portrait of a girl&quot; especially comes to mind in the beginning pages when we meet Claude Le Viste through Nicolas eyes. It should be noted however, that although Tracy Chevalier does present an interesting, captivating tale, it sometimes withdraws into a too romantic, soap opera kind of novel. This reader was willing to accept such writing as there is a solid substance behind it and the writer knows where she wants to take you. Nevertheless, I did not feel that the feministic messages were in place (re Christine Du Sablon and other female characters) and not always appropriate to the period's thinking. Same criticism can be said about the fact that the author feels the need to &quot;resolve&quot; the problems/issues of every character and even gives us an epilogue with details about the future of each figure. Although this is &quot;nice to have&quot; I did not feel it was really necessary and in a way lowered the perception of this book as a more serious work.	2004-03-24

Although not a literary masterpiece (and does not intend to be one), it is witty, very funny and thought provoking (in the sense that some of Townsend's perception of life stays with you after you finished the book). This is really an assortment of short, 2.5 page long pieces (which appeared as monthly columns on the Sainsbury's Magazine), thus making it a perfect book for travel. The reader has to concentrate for a short while, is able to leave the book and come back later for another part (order is not very important). <BR>And yet, although the pieces are not connected to each other, after a few chapters you feel as if you are reading (or talking to) a familiar person whose life, or rather his life philosophy you are beginning to share and enjoy. <BR>Off course Susan Townsend has chosen what she would like to share with the reader and what to leave out. In fact she swears never to join these columnists who write about their &quot;damned cats&quot; (or family members), etc. only to break this rule time and again, to reader's full enjoyment. Ms. Townsend writes about her writing problems, travels, people she meets, domestic issues and writing problems again... Still, what she writes is close to heart as she always writes about her failures, fashion mistakes, health problems (is there anyone who cannot identify with back pain?), dreams of a better house.... Townsend is always intelligent, and you find yourself laughing out loud. The issues are varied, from a disturbing piece about the behavior of a British tourist during a Greek funeral to having no ideas for this month's column.<BR>I think I liked this book because it was so down to earth, with a very un-assuming approach to living and to yourself.	2004-03-23
US	43044046	R1SU2OLYE3C657	0375704027	339664983	Norwegian Wood	Books	5	14	14	N	N	Sad and painful	What is it about these Japanese writers that are able to make prose sound like Poetry? I am a fan of Banana Yoshimoto, another Japanese writer, whose book \\"the Kitchen\\" is one of my favorites. Norwegian Wood deals with the same \\"life after (the) death (of a close person)\\" issues and what it does to those left behind. However, whereas \\"the Kitchen\\" is a short, condensed book which brings on, alongside the feelings of grief and pain a very strong passion for life and all it has to offer, Norwegian Wood is a very long (at least - it feels like very long) tale with a lot of detailed inside reflection and thought. <BR>I was not expecting this book to be what it is - a wonderful, dark piece of art. A heavy shadow clings to your heart while reading this story and the feeling of sadness and very deep sorrow is overwhelming and stays with you for a long time. I was therefore surprised to read that this book is described as an \\"erotic love story\\". It is true that the book has many sex scenes, but the sex is so painful and so connected to the overall grave feeling of the book that it brings no comfort. Also, the words \\"love story \\", seem - so I feel - to simplify this very complicated story.<BR>Reading the translator's note at the end of the book I understand that the story has some autobiographical points, especially in the portrayal of a Japanese student life in the 70 years. For me however, this was a very personal inner account of a difficult time in a young man's life - a period that will leave its deep marks and in many ways will shape the man he is about to become. Norwegian Wood deals with questions of loyalty - to yourself, to the dead and the living and discusses the thin line between sanity and insanity. Most of all you are a participant to the hero's inner world - his feelings and the process of his falling in love - what he is drawn to and what captures his heart.<BR>Highly recceomended.	2004-02-27
US	43044046	RGMVDOUER5BCM	014023313X	619669899	The Stone Diaries	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Everyday life, much like your own	This is supposedly the life story of Daisy Stone Goodwill, a fictional character stretching on from her birth to her death, more then 80 years later. Daisy is a fictional character but this detail is forgotten as the story unfolds due to the richness of minor details describing her life. <BR>I am not sure however that in the end, I really know Daisy. I mean, I do know all about her life, how many kids, where she lived and what she did but I am not sure I know what she really thought. Did she love her kids? Her husband? What did she think of them and of her function in their lives? Of her life? <BR>In a way this story reminds me of the way we talk about other people. We give out all the information there is about other people and make out our own theories, but do we really know them? One of my favorite parts of the story therefore was the part where close people are trying to theorize why Daisy is in a bad mood. They each have a theory, which can tell you more about them and their place in the world, and somehow with all the theories you reach your own conclusions about Daisy. But you never get the real truth from Daisy herself (or maybe there isn't one truth?).  <BR>The book is not an easy read. The writing is special and beautiful and the writer moves through different writing styles. It is both the problem and the quality of this writing that it sometimes goes into excessive details. It is truly the writing that is the essence of this book and not necessarily the story itself.<br />When I first started to read this book (I read it for quite a while. This is not a book I could read in &quot;one sitting&quot;) I felt that I would never be able to go past the first chapter. It was so long and so very detailed! It took me a while to really get into this book and surprisingly I was more interested in Daisy's old age period. I wanted to know how she anticipated death or what she thought about the nearing end but I am not sure I got all the answers, just that she stayedloyal to herself and to her efforts, those that she had all her life, to be sweet and not to trouble anyone. . <BR>Daisy is no great person - not in her eyes and not in the writer or readers eyes. This is why I found this story interesting. She is just like the reader, having an everyday life, very close to your own. Someone you can really identify with. The book brings on many philosophical questions and thoughts - such as are we all victims of the circumstances? How can we control our lives? When I think about Daisy's life I think that the one decision she really made for herself in whom she shaped her own destiny was when she decided to go to the trip to Canada. <BR>However, was that really her choice? It seemed somehow like something very predictable. It is scary to think that this says something about our own life too... and how predictable they are.<BR>Bottom line: this is not a book I will read again. Its power was mainly the beauty of the writing and the thoughts it evokes. However you are left with a sad feeling of waste - long life passes on without really leaving a mark.	2004-01-25

Only after reading the book do I understand what a good movie it was and how faithful to the book. The narration in the movie is actually a word by word reading of several parts of the story, usually these parts which reflect the character's thoughts or inner feelings (\\"she was embarrassed to be seen because she had recently grown breasts\\" - Delia).<BR>The movie is amazing, but it can be such only due to the tale it draws upon. <BR>These are seven stories of women in different ages, geographical regions and social status. These are stories of revelation - of a certain understanding that comes in a brief moment in time. <BR>The beauty of this book is first of all the amazing writing. On the one hand the accounts are very readable, condensed, using everyday language (\\"and, as was her custom, got up to go to the john\\"...Bryna) and on the other hand, somehow the way this language is put together, can sometimes make it sound like poetry (\\"She kept the two narratives distinct in her mind; they coexisted as if in twin universes separated by a vast field of space. The only trouble was that Greta was exhausted ... the fittings...the dinners, the bachelorette party, and the cold that Max had given her\\" - Greta).  It does not matter who you read about, you are drawn to the story and to the insides of the heroine's mind and feelings until you can accept all her actions and remain totally unjudgemental. This is also true of unpleasant accounts, where the characters (Nancy is a good example) could not have won the reader's heart in any other setting.<BR>It was interesting to read how other reviewers interpreted or understood the stories and to see the diversity in the points this book is given. Since theviews are not similar, I take it as a proof that this is a story that has you thinking about, analyzing, and reflecting. Not all is clear and your interpretation relies on your life understanding as well. The stories are indeed cut short as one reviewer commented, but I felt that what I read was enough to guess further and to make the point the author intended. The stories sort of give you a glimpse of our heroine's lives and how one event affects another. Bryna, which is able to avoid hate towards her mother in law (explaining to herself that the woman is mad), and actually reaches (at the end of a long hard day) a very intimate feeling and closeness to her husband and Nancy, whose future does not look promising, but the reader can understand that this is a lonely lost child.  <BR>I enjoyed each and every one of the characters and could relate to all of them, which is the accomplishment of this great author.	2004-01-21

Comic horrors? ... The mind does not grasp this mode of writing, especially in the beginning when you wonder whether to laugh or cry and remain with an uneasy feeling of &quot;something is wrong&quot;. Yes, you are right, something is definitely wrong. This however is a feeling I assume the writer wanted you to feel - you are in horror, but life goes on so you find things to laugh about. You have to try and continue your regular life, even if it's living under a strict regime. <BR>I guess it is always easier to understand history when you know the small mundane details of the lives of one person or one family. Otherwise this history is not comprehensive. Was it not easier to believe that all Iranians accepted the new regime and its new policies? Sarapti makes you understand how life could have gone on in spite of the surrounding atmosphere and gives you an inside look of what was the surrounding atmosphere.<BR>&quot;This really happened&quot; or &quot;My father really said that&quot; mentions the author several times in the book as if to say: &quot;pay attention, this really happened. It might seem crazy but no, I have lived in this craziness&quot;.<BR>As I wrote before the writing is not always comprehensible. In the beginning the author mentions several issues you fully understand only in a second reading or only later in the book - for example &quot;our maid did not eat with us&quot;, &quot;my dad drove a Cadillac&quot; or different conversations with god. In the beginning, when you come armed with your expectations about the book this does not fit at all, but only falls to place much later.  All this adds to the stark feeling of this book magnified by the black and white drawings. <BR>The most haunting picture is of course the last one who can touch every person who had to experience separation. At once the tragedy of this whole situation is made clear.<BR>The book is very interesting although not enjoyable - was never intended to be such.	2003-12-17
US	43044046	R1WGDBDG5V3X2K	0140280464	18229976	My Year of Meats	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Great book in spite of soap opera kind of ending	This book is so rich in content, story line, facts, ideas, human tales and culture that its reading becomes an extraordinary experience. I will even dare say that you will end the reading having been slightly changed...at least you are bound to become more aware regarding the meat you bring into your body and the meat industry in general,regarding the connection (on which we do not like to think about) between the beef health and our health...<BR>This total experience (which is quite hard at times, especially for a meat lover like myself), and the time I spent thinking about this book are the reason I gave it 5 points. This, I have to say is in spite of the fact that the book does have its problems, mainly the last part which suddenly withdraws to some kind of banality and a soap opera kind of development... This flaw however is minor compared to the total reading experience. Not only is the tale surprising and unique, consuming from moment one and throwing you into the story - it is also quite educating in many levels. You receive a very close look at the American and Japanese cultures in ways I have never met before - maybe because you go right into the kitchens of people...right into their soft bellies. Also educating in the sense that the reader accompanies the narrator in her discovery search learning more facts about the meat industry as the book proceeds. This by the way, also means that there are no hidden messages in the story. Everything is presented right to your face in a very explicit, straight forward, bluntly intended way. <BR>All in all, this is first of all a truly good story. This is a book that keeps you hooked, wanting to find out what happens to the two main characters which immediately gain your sympathy, each one in her own world with her different struggles. <BR>This is the story of Jane Takagi Little, a Japanese American hired by the American Beef Industry (&quot;Beef Ex&quot;) to help in the promotion of American Meat to the Japanese Market. This is done by the creation of a weekly Television show called &quot;My American Wife&quot; which presents a different American Wife every week, shows her family and self and brings, in a step by step way, her recipe for a favorite meaty dish. Jane is supposed to locate these American wives who need to comply with Japanese standards of attractiveness, wholesomeness, etc. Jane not only discovers back yard America, so different from the NY way of life Jane was familiar with, but also Japanese taste and customs which she was not aware of. This is also a very hard search into her past and present and her role, meaning and wants in life. This is also the story of Akiko, the Japanese wife of the Advertising manager in charge of the show and how her life changes due to the program. This is also the story of several families which Jane meets and films during her &quot;year of meat&quot; and which she and the readers are not about to forget.<BR>I was a little disappointed to read from other reviews that the writer was indeed a documentary film maker who dealt with the beef industry herself. This in a way mellowed down my admiration for the writer's genuine creative idea... The truth as always, can be more interesting or unbeliveable then any fiction.	2003-12-07
US	43044046	R3TW7WDG5GUJG8	0375726055	877497311	Sputnik Sweetheart: A Novel	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Poetic and surprising story - presence of absence	I am still uncertain I grasped all the underlying meanings and intentions of Haruki Murakami in this poetic story but know that this was a unique read; one which requires time and thought in order to really &quot;get into&quot; and enjoy. The story takes several turns and its focus shifts between its three characters.<BR>The story starts with the description of Sumire, a bit of a lost soul who wants to become a writer. Sumire writes all the time, but something is lacking. Her male friend, the narrator of the story whose name is never revealed, encourages her that &quot;a story is not something of this world. A real story requires a kind of magical baptism to link the world on this side with the world on the other side...&quot;<BR>what he really means is that Sumire needs more time, more life experience, maybe more pain in order to breath life into the story; Sumire however, seems to remain on the search for the &quot;other side&quot;. When Sumire falls in love with Miu, a much older business woman, her life undergoes a tremendous change and suddenly she is no longer able to write. As if somehow the focus of her life has shifted... The voice of the narrator who has been telling us about Sumire changes its tone and we now understand that he is an active participant in the story - he is in love with Sumire but understands that his love for this meaningful and special soul companion will not be returned. This is the pain he has to suffer.<BR>The story reaches its climax in the Greek island where Sumire and Miu have gone for vacation. One night the narrator receives a telephone call from Miu who begs him to come to the Island at once. <BR>It is never clear who is the real hero of the story as the tale shifts from one character to another and all characters are endearing in the same tender vulnerable way. Maybe the male narrator, speaking in its own voice is the one who touches your heart the most but you can feel the pain and lonliness of all characters and their endlesssearch for something which is impossible to get.. at least not on this side. <BR>The story is definitely surprising - starting from its special name and characters and follow its intriguing tale, touching the real and the supernatural in a way that is in total harmony and agreement with all the book.<BR>Sputnik Sweetheart deals with the presence and absence of people and how absence can be present in every nuance of ones life. I think this is also intended in the name of the story and the explanation given in the preface to the term &quot;Sputnik&quot; ending in the words: &quot;but the satellite was never recovered&quot;...which should have given me the first clue to what is about to happen, one of the many clues and signs that Murakami will give along the book. The book by the way is not depressing as it may sound. Sad and poetic yet you can feel a life force running underneath.	2003-11-03

How women can draw strength from each other and learn how to live (and survive) in a world whose rules are changing because of the war.  Alice and Mother Bullock, Charlie' s strict mother are left alone in Bramble Farm with only the Negro and the hired man, both of which disappear after a short while. Although Alice and Mother Bullock do not really like each other they learn to work together and respect each other. <BR>Alice life is described in detail in the candid letters she writes her sister Lizzie. This is very close to writing a diary as Alice does not hold anything from her sister, unless this is something she can not discuss even with herself. <BR>The letters portray a growing up period for Alice who had no other way but to change from a young bride to a woman who has responsibility over the lives of others. Alice liked to have a good time, and is especially vain (as she herself says) over her sewing and quilting skills. This is her comfort and when she quilts, she forgets her fatigue. <BR>I especially liked the beginning of each chapter where the Author takes time to explain about various quilt designs, their meaning and the history and art of quilts. This book was also educating to me in the sense it gives a very real account of life during the civil war which was especially interesting to someone non-american as myself who had no knowledge of the accounts of this war. <BR>Alice is a great heroine. She is a fiesty, clever girl and we follow her small and large struggles a with care. <BR>Tremendously enjoying, as I may say are all of Sandra Dallas's books.	2003-09-15

It seems that as the story unfolds the writer strips yet another layer and plunges deeper.... Unexpected things happen all the time and every chapter brings us new information about Olivia, our heroine. <BR>For me the story was painful and sad to read and I thought it had a very grown up message about death and life beyond. The story is about loneliness and overcoming great pain  -how you have to cling to your loved ones...This is how I personally experienced this book and it is this feeling, the wonderful imagination, the captivating stories and the unexpected way the plot proceeds that make me declare this book as \\"surprising\\". However, this is first of all a great book full of imagination where the story line shifts between pieces of reality and imagination and the reader has to guess what is really happening in real life. Olivia is only a child but has already the need to deal with lots of hard questions. On one level this is an exciting adventure children story with a brave and clever heroine, pirates, sailors, ghosts and magic. On the other hand this is an adult story full of great truth about life. The adventure story can be seen as a long painful search in Olivia's soul until she finds an answer... <BR>At first the story is read as a regular adventure story -Olivia's father is the superintendent in a rather regular and gray apartment building. As the father is the worst superintendent ever, he usually gets fired after a short while and Olivia thinks that maybe this time this is not so bad. She hates the neighbors. One afternoon when Olivia looses the keys and has to wait outside her door a series of coincidences happens and Olivia moves from one apartment to the other, meeting her weird, special neighbours, each with his own story that somehow falls, by the end of the story to the right place....  The most extraordinary things happen to Oliviabut she does not question their reality for one minute; how can she? These things are happening to her! And the reader moves along with Olivia.<BR>Ellen Potter succeeded in creating a delightful imaginative world. As the story unfolds the reader understands that some of the things might have happened and could be accepted on certain conditions; in any case there is an inner logic in the world Ellen Potter creates. <BR>A very unique story which can appeal to many ages. <BR>I am sure this book will get the attention it deserves.	2003-09-06

On the one hand the book is funny and deals with a real life problem of kindergarden and primary school children (\\"he is a copycat\\" is a regular accusation at my house). However, reading this story after reading Peggy Rathmann's three other books: \\"Gorilla\\", \\"Officer Buckle and Gloria\\" and \\"Ten minutes till bedtime\\" is a little disappointing. The three books mentioned are totally hilarious and I feel they are all unique and special works of art. This book however, although very good, does not come to their masterpiece level. <BR>\\"Ruby the Copycat\\" is written with a neutral voice without \\"taking sides\\" - just telling the story as it is. Reader can understand both Ruby, the copycat, and in a way even understand why she is copying (Ruby is the new kid and Angela's ribbon is so very charming) but also see the point of view of those being copied - as Angela, whose every act (red ribbon in hair, rainbow painted shirt) is copied by Ruby. At first this is nice and Angela whispers back at Ruby \\"I like your ribbon\\" - but after a while Angela does not whisper any more... Ruby is stripping her of all individuality. These are an adult words but the book is written in a language every child can understand and the pictures are there to strengthen the words. Ruby wins the readers heart in the end when following the teacher's advice (don't we all wish for such teachers) finds her own unique \\"thing\\" and now the children copy Ruby's \\"hopping\\".	2003-09-01
US	43044046	R35DB4ZHGWPZGI	044503128X	906138291	The Road Through the Wall	Books	5	23	24	N	N	A chilling masterpiece	Shirley Jackson is often described as a \\"Horror\\" writer; however, her power comes not from horrible bloody descriptions but rather from very down tuned, indifferent, every-day descriptions to the most vicious acts. Her descriptions are so mellowed that I felt confused and checked myself over and again to see if I understood correctly and something bad really did happen. <BR>This is a story of one street and its inhabitants, but could have easily been any other street in any suburb. In fact, Shirley Jackson herself said that the book was written, at least partly, to get back at her parents, so some of it has to be a life she knew. I believe I am right to guess that the character of Harriet Merriam, a girl in her adolescent years, who is fat and not pretty, has many \\"bits and pieces\\" of Shirley Jackson herself, especially in the first pages where Harriet's mother goes through her letters. This act, which according to biographers happened to Shirley herself, is mentioned in \\"Hangsaman\\" another of Jackson's first books. <BR>The story takes time getting into, the reason being that there are so many (around 20) characters and it takes time to differentiate between them. There is actually no character that is really \\"loveable\\" - if someone is described as a successful child or adult, then he has other faults. I guess this is exactly like real life where no one is perfect but it is so different from other literary works where even if a hero is imperfect you can have some sympathy towards several characters. Here the reader's sympathy does not exist although some people are more detestable then others. The merciless description of the characters even caused me some uneasiness at first. You can see down to the person's essence - as if you look at his soul with a magnifying glass and this intimate viewing can be quite uncomfortable. <BR>The horrors of this story can mainly be described as the inability of accepting anyone who is different: Jews, Chinese, retarded people. Shirley Jackson gives us a variety of outsiders. The horrors are also the powers of parents, narrow and limited in their world perception to forever change or shape their children world and not for the best. This issue is not new; however has a striking and horrifying appearance in this book. <BR>This is a powerful chilling book which, once you get into it (this takes time), cannot be put down. Shirley Jackson has a great knowledge of human nature which is again apparent in this book<BR>I do wish I had some people around me I could discuss this book with. I was even disappointed to find only one review of this book as I am really interested in hearing how other people have understood or \\"felt\\" this book. I have studied Shirley Jackson's famous short story \\"the Lottery\\" at the university and am longing to analyze this book in the same way....I feel there is so much more to this book then what I was able to grasp and so many other nuances connected to the symbolism of the new road, the different family lives portrayed and the relationship and similarities between woman to woman, mother - daughter, father - son relationships to relationships between the kids themselves. I have to add that some of the elements of \\"the Lottery\\" are apparent here. What I mean is the seemingly peaceful, lovely atmosphere and the inner turbulence which becomes apparent through the end, when a victim who was introduced and chosen before is pointed out. <BR>This is a masterpiece I highly recommend.	2003-09-01

The writer goes along the stages of the recipe while describing to us the emotions and happenings that go on in the all female De La Garza family controlled by the strong and powerful Mama Elena, the cruel mother, and especially in the mind of Tita, the truly tragic heroine. <BR>This is the story of Tita and Pedro, the young lovers who were destined to a life of suffering by the old tradition which condemns the youngest daughter to stay at home and take care of her mother until her death. Mama Elena was not going to give up on this tradition and denied Pedro's wish to marry Tita so that Tita can serve her until her death. Wanting to be next to Tita, Pedro marries Rosaura, Tita's big sister whom he does not love.  Tita is one of the greatest heroines there is, in her devotion to Pedro, her suffering and especially in the way she cooks. Raised in the kitchen since her early days, Tita invests all her love and feelings into her food preparation and the food in turn affects every person that eats it with an overflow of emotions . <BR>This is a passionate and sensual story which is a blend of reality and mystical forces. The dead people have their way of influencing the living, whispering directions in their ears or coming to condemn their actions. The story, like the film, is enraging with the hopeless pitiless destiny that is forced on Tita and on the other hand is tender and sweet with the smells, flavors and colors an with the ways Tita finds to show her love. Tita finds the powers within to build a life for herself, even if this life is to be disclosed from everyone else. The writing is flowing and poetic and all the half-mystical half-real descriptions are presented as mere facts, as I believe they are accepted in the places Laura Esquivel writes about. One of the most lovely, most sensual stories there is.	2003-08-17

This combined with the story of Claire, a young woman who struggles with life in New York, should have made this book into a treat. However the author, which no doubt has a lot of Latin knowledge - did not deliver. The dish that came out is tedious and didactic. <BR>I assume that Lori Marie Carlson is very educated with the matter of Latin culture - and definitely has a vast knowledge about food, music and poetry. I also assume she chose this book as a means to enrich the reader with her wisdom. It is clear that a lot of research  was done before writing this book; however the book does not rise above its didactic informative descriptions that seem to lead nowhere. <BR>Claire meets her Latin friends to a monthly feast called \\"Tertulia\\" which is described as a \\"gathering of confidants who share poetic musings, secret sorrows and savory treats\\". Each chapter in the book is dedicated to one such meeting while in between we read something about Claire's life - but this serves only as a smooth passage to the \\"Tertulia\\" and its different monthly subject. <BR>The main part of the book is dedicated to the different views, the diverse ways to translate life as experienced by the participants of the Tertulia: Sonia, Luna, Isabela, Pearl, Aroma, Winifred. Each one with her own philosophy. I cannot say that these women are not wise. They do have fine things to say and some of their stories can be interesting but all in all, the entire story does not get anywhere and the conversation between the women is wearisome and slow. I cannot believe that this is a true account of the way people speak. I have been in many women gatherings where one issue leads to another and a topic can be discussed with a lot of laughter and tears - but no informal conversation I have joined was ever held in a form of lecture where every woman says what she has to say in a sort of speech and then shuts up. At least, this does not happen with the women I know. <BR>The book does not allow any real development of characters - not Claire, whom the other women wish so much to \\"educate\\" and not any one of the other wiser women. The reader does not really care what happens to them next or what they have to say.	2003-08-11

Raymond Carver's short stories are a special treat in this regard. I first came by Raymond Carver's name while watching the movie \\"Short cuts\\". This is why I was so intrigued to read this book, his first collection of short stories. <BR>\\"Will you please be quiet, please?\\" is an assortment of harsh, condensed, short stories. The stories are brief and \\"to the point\\". Carver captures the human experience at a certain important moment in time. This moment can seem trivial to an outside observer, but this is a flash of revelation, a private understanding that comes after a seemingly regular event. This is a moment of small change, recognition --- something will not remain as it was before.  <BR>The story \\"Fat\\" can be a good example for Carver's style. \\"Fat\\" opens the book and is one of my favorite stories in this collection. This is an account of a rather trivial, every day encounter of a waitress with a fat client. However, this encounter manages to shake something inside her and force her to feel something of his \\"Fat experience\\". Somehow this makes her think about relationships and people and brings her to a certain realization as to her personal interactions.  <BR>Carver does not glorify human beings. His description is not tender and he does not write with mercy. This is true regarding instants of ugliness and on the other hand - quick moments of great love and compassion - just as during one day you can have mixed feelings and a great moment of love can come from nowhere and just pass by, sometimes even unnoticed.  Somehow Carver manages to grasp the stream of thoughts, feelings and events that led to the after come feeling. <BR>Carver's descriptions give us glimpses of life - ordinary, as it happens in real. No drama around it. Carver talks about father son relationship, husband and wife or two lovers.  Most of his stories deal with difficult moments, and center around simple, ordinary people, struggling to make a life to themselves - Like Al, the main character in \\"Jerry and Molly and Sam\\". Al feels his life is falling apart. His work is not secure any more, he has an affair and is a little terrified by it, he just rented a new apartment... and on top of it there's this new dog his sister in law brought the kids. As an attempt to put some order in his personal chaos Al decides he has to get rid of the dog - an act that puts him into an emotional turmoil of facing his inner self. <BR>These stories are \\"short cuts\\" of life, which can be ugly and beautiful but is never dull.	2003-07-30

Husband is as usual quiet and does not give any consolation and the Lady struggles to please everyone and not forget herself and her own wishes (and health) on the way. How very sad to discover it was the same (woman) world even 70 years ago ... Book is so very candid and manages to capture the ever lasting nuances of human behavior (\\"Mem: Candid and intelligent self examination as to motive, etc., often leads to very distressing revelations....\\"), little lies, social pretenses and the day to day struggles. Funny and entertaining yet can be tiring at times - since the day to day life is indeed tiring . Very very British and thus charming.	2003-07-20

He is an outgoing person and she is dreamlike and likes to stay at home. Jack keeps teasing Rose and scaring her at night and on the whole they do not get along. One day their mother tells them both to go outside and play. Jack finds a tunnel and is lost in a scary forest. Rose stays behind but after a while, when she understands something must have happened to Jack she follows him into the forest and with the power of her love (hugs and tears) saves him from a grim fate. This is the storyline and if you feel you have already heard it somewhere - it is possibly true. There is something very clichd and worn out about this story and only the charming Anthony Browne drawings make this story worthy of appreciation; the drawings are, truly beautiful. <BR>I admit that in all of Browne books the text does not say a lot and relies heavily on the drawings to shed another light or give an interpretation to the words. In this story too the drawings are so rich there is not always need for words (for example - the last picture shows brother and sister smiling at each other and indeed there is no need to explain what they feel or say anything else). However, the drawings are not able to compensate for the fact that something is very shallow here and not always credible. The story tells us that Jack was really mean to Rose and used to scare her at night. Is she so quick to forget? It seems that he was not nice to her in any way. What made her so devoted? Am I not correct  in assuming that a normal child behavior in such a case was to run home and ask for help....? Or maybe I am looking for logic in a place of fantasy where the logic is not really important? \\"I knew you would come\\" says Jack to Rose so maybe he did know her better.   This reader however remained with a feeling of disappointment. <BR>It seems that my son shares my feelings as this is not a book he wants to read again whereas other Anthony Browne books (such as\\"Gorilla\\" and \\"Piggybook\\") are of his favorites.	2003-07-08

I used to read many of Judy Blume books as a teenager, but this book together with Blume's \\"Deenie\\" have remained dear to me till this day,  around 20 years later. I think there is something about this book that is able, so I feel, to address young readers and adults alike. I will not write about the content as so many people have done so before me, just about my thoughts concerning this book.<BR>Sally is looking at the adult world with open curious eyes, not always able to understand grown ups and the grown-up world. The adults in the book, on the other side, are so much better understood by me today, their characters (so well defined) and their efforts to try and raise their children according to the best of their knowledge and what they deem important in life. <BR>This book is dear to me for many reasons. First of all - the characters are so Jewish I immediately feel its close to home. I am talking about the ever worried mother, the constant haunting of the holocaust, the conversations, the Yiddish expressions... and especially my favorite character in the book which is Ma Fanny, the lovely grandmother.  I love this book because of the adults efforts to build a sheltered world for the kids who are, as the mother and grandmother say \\"all my life\\" and thus sometimes protect them too much from the outside world. Because of the good yet real family relationships (\\"you are worth a million...more even\\"...) and the accurate portrayal of the family life. Sally is such a funny lovable character and her inner portrayal is rich and trustworthy.	2003-07-08

I am tempted to say that the story will most appeal to senior age women. On a second thought... maybe not. It will appeal to anyone who has been thinking of senior age, to anyone who has felt lonely, closed behind four walls, trying to figure out what to do with a day that stretches out endlessly... I myself do not belong to any of the above mentioned groups and still, have found this book to be relaxing and comforting, as in the end the bottom line is as always - reach out to other people.  <BR>This is a book of change. A very slow change that can happen in every age. Candida Wilton writes to herself the accounts of her London life. We do not know if Candida means her diary to be read by other people (there are hints she does), but it seems she wants to arrange her thoughts and feelings.  Candida moved to London by herself after her divorce from Andrew. She says out front that she is not in a close touch with her three daughters. She does not make an effort to be connected to them or does not show the reader that she is much bothered by this fact. Only towards the end of the book do we start to understand the nature of her relationship with her daughters.<br />In London Candida tries to find what to do with her time. She walks, she exercises in the gym. She waits.  <br />The main appeal of this book is its sincerity -although sincerity has many layers, as I understood in the end of the book. There are things you hold even from yourself. Candida's (she is candid) mood changes from depression (that even she is not able to fully admit to herself) to feelings of anticipation... a certainty that something good is about to happen to her; and indeed it does. The second part of the story is also told by Candida, however in the third voice and describes the trip she holds with her friends. Candida (or rather Margaret Drabble) seems to experiment with several methods of writing in order to achieve a better understanding of herself, or of others... The changing methods of writing are quite sophisticated and many issues connected with the changing methods are understood only later in the story. I am not certain these changes in tone were necessary. This is a good story which is able to stand by itself and I am not sure it needed all the decorations. <br />The Seven Sisters has a somewhat contradictory nature: surprising and boring, slow and fast, sincere and yet not totally revealing. I can understand all those who wrote it is slow. Indeed, this is part of the charm I found in this book. It did convince me as a frank description of a person writing to himself about all the small mundane details that make up one's life; accounts of conversations, thoughts, sights, things you eat. Face it; this is what you think about during the day, not always about highly philosophical issues. However, although the account is slow, there are sudden fast changes between the four parts, whereas the fourth part seems to be the most revealing. After you get used to a certain tone in the account, there are fast sudden changes. There is one part in the story which made me feel betrayed and cheated, and here I do agree with previous reviewers but all in all this is a believable story of real life. Candida is a dry person who does not hold a high opinion of herself - and this again is another appeal of the book. Its about regular people trying to give meaning to their lives in every age.	2003-07-07
US	43044046	R2X5DAGW562U3S	0802138209	400458351	Asleep	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A dreamlike hazy world.	Overcoming a loss is the subject of this book - much like Yoshimoto's other work. Yoshimoto's characters are always people on the verge of a breakdown of some sort; however, some mystical force is able to pull them back to life. Although this description might seem strange to people who have not read Yoshimoto before, it is accepted in Banana Yoshimoto's work. All of Yoshimoto's stories are a blend of the real and the unreal. On the one hand she can describe in detail the most daily and realistic activities and on the other hand her stories speak naturally of a supernatural force in life, be it intuition, visions or any other surreal happenings. Yoshimoto describes some powerful force that cannot be explained in the means we know but that somehow seems genuine in the world Yoshimoto creates. I guess it is accepted because Yoshimoto does not use any big words or declarations. She talks about events every person can relate to and the\\"force\\" she describes is really something that comes from within (the mind, the heart, the subconscious). <BR>All of Yoshimoto stories have a spiritual sense to them which is achieved both by the story and the poetic language. <BR>&quot;Asleep&quot; contains 3 stories that revolve around the subject of sleep: In the first story the narrator, a young woman, talks about the two loves of her dead brother. The narrator does not mention her mourning or her suffering. She describes other people and their loss and the bereavement comes out through every cherished memory and the troubling, bitter-sweet recollections. The writer tells us about her good relationships with the two women and learns what an important role they play in her life in the past and in the present. <BR>The second story deals with a woman who escapes to alcohol. She feels the alcohol is like an obsession she cannot control. Something that clouds her days and nights. After she tackles an \\"open issue\\" from her past and comes to terms with herself and her \\"inner world\\" things areimproving. <BR>In the third story \\"Asleep\\" the heroine is struggling with the sleep that overtakes her whole day. She is drifting through a current emptiness in her life following a loss of a close soul. This character has a man in her life whose wife is in coma - thus sleep surrounds her from all sides. She learns to see that the sleep is there for a reason and to understand it as the friend she lost used to work in \\"sleeping next to people\\". Her job was to ensure these people that her presence is close by, and thus to free them from their troubling dreams. All these incoherent details and \\"weird\\" characters are beautifully woven together.  Yoshimoto has a lovely way of describing people and the connections between them.  My only criticism is that \\"Asleep\\" does not achieve the \\"perfect\\" level of \\"Kitchen\\". The story is sometimes very slow and reflective and therefore I gave it only 4 out of 5 points.	2003-06-11

I wanted to shout when I arrived at the ending of this book. I still remain under the impression of this story thinking over and again about the characters, searching for clues and trying to understand how everything about their description and evolvement has built up to such a conclusion. I am even a bit displeased with Anne Tyler of choosing to end the book in such a way.  I negotiate with her in my mind but have to conclude she was right...<BR>Celestial Navigation is presented from different perspectives. Each chapter has the voice of a different person and Anne Tyler manages to give each personality its own unique tone and its special, different thoughts. Jeremy for example thinks in colors shapes and contours. He is always being \\"told about\\" and not presented in his own voice like the other women characters. Maybe because his mind is so confused that the readers, like the people surrounding him, will not be able to understand it if his \\"inside\\" was presented. The writer sort of \\"explains him\\" to us. <BR>There are no good or bad characters (well - the writer and the readers do not really appreciate Olivia but we understand her. We know where she is coming from) - all are human beings and you can understand what \\"makes them tick.  Every character has flaws that are seen only when you look from the outside. When people think from the inside out they can think about personal faults that no one else seems to notice.  <BR>Jeremy's personality is explained very well and although he is totally different you feel you know him. Mary seems to be more easy to figure out but its with her we are surprised when we learn what other people think and feel about her actions.<BR>These characters are so achingly real it hurts. These are no hot shots. We have a group of real life losers. When I say losers I mean if they are judged according to society strict rules of success and happiness. Anne Tyler however wants to tell us that happiness is not always what you see on the surface and people can sometimes know only after  that they were happy. Also communication is the essence of it all and can be done in a variety of ways, as long as its done...<BR>Tender, lovely heartbreaking story.	2003-06-04

Although I heard a lot about it and knew what to anticipate I did not expect to be so troubled by its content or to spend so much time thinking about the incidents and characters described  (not that these characters  deserve it). This is truly no great masterpiece and sometimes it is even quite banal; another weakness is the fact that it seems the writers used all of the enraging incidents they personally met or heard about and put them all in this book (well, at least this is what I would LIKE to think... or am I comforting myself? Is there really such a creature as Mrs. X...) Yet, as much as I reassured myself during the reading that \\"this cannot be true\\" I am sure there are many houses alike and the hype surrounding this book is justified if only in getting a lot of public attention on exactly the issues raised in the manuscript. <BR>The book is very readable and I think that there is no one that can say he did not feel some sort of rage and anger towards the X's ... ... even if it is a planned reaction - one that the book is clearly intended to achieve.  <br />Nanny has no back bone? True; however, if she did, I guess we would not have had a book and purpose of the story, as I understand it was to tell us not specifically about Nanny but more about the X's characters. In spite of the seemingly easy nature of the book it seriously relates to important subjects - our objectives in having children (other then holding your husband, the Mrs. X way), actual time we spend with them, our own achievements and wants in life, etc. and the number 1 controversial issue - how to raise children. <BR>To those who suffered like me from the revenge-less ending - revenge is best served cold - I am sure that Mrs. X, or her likes did not enjoy reading this book. I hope that by writing this best seller the writers can have their small revenge on all the Mrs. X's they have worked for.	2003-05-27

I really did not expect such an entertaining modern book. Although this is a book that was published, as I understand in 1948, it is very modern and refreshing and seems to be dealing with issues relevant to young women in any time and place.   <BR>What is mostly refreshing is the writing of Cassandra, the 17 year old narrator. Cassandra would like to be a writer one day and therefore writes this account. She writes candidly, vividly and with no need to impress herself or others. Cassandra is totally true to herself and the fact that the Dodie Smith chose this mechanism of diary writing as her narrating tool allows us to see Cassandra grow, mature and understand the world in front of our eyes. The descriptions are real, alive and very detailed. The story, which can be very simply described as a sort of love story is interesting due to the lovely characters. Cassandra which the reader knows inside and out, a person that likes human beings and nature alike. The beautiful rural English view comes alive through her eyes as well as the behaviours of the people surrounding her. Cassandra has an eye for detail and a natural way to catch all gestures (an example for this would be Cassandra's description of her sister Rose drinking the green Menthe drink which she chose on purpose as it matches her hair).  We also have Rose, Cassandra's elder sister, beautiful and looking for a way to escape her poverty life, Thomas their younger brother, Stephan a servant son who has been living with the family, the father, a writer who does not write, and their stepmother, Topaz, a model for artists, full of good will and kindness. All these characters are presented as round figures, we see their good and bad qualities and this mixture, together with further characters makes this a superb book. Pure entertainment.	2003-05-22
US	43044046	R1ZYFU4T1POUJH	0030844967	112146530	Feast of the Serpent	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Good writing. Difficult subject	Adonell was born to an English father and a gypsy mother. When her mother went to live with her husband's family she had to give up her gypsy ways. Now, around 13-14 years later when her husband dies, Lureni feels she has made a mistake by raising Adonell as an English and not teaching her the Faa (gypsy) ways. Lureni is alarmed when she hears about witch hunts. She has known such things when she was young and what she knows is enough to make her feel afraid. Now she feels time is short; she is sick, and feels she must make sure Adonell is protected before she dies. She takes Adonell away to search her Faa tribe at their annual \\"Feast of the Serpent\\" to beg that they take Adonell over to the tribe. This is how the story \\"Feast of the Serpent\\" begins. <BR>\\"Feast of the Serpent\\" is not an easy book and I do not think it was intended for children. Maybe for young adolescence and even so, the issues dealt with are not simple.  Adonell faces hardships of various sorts and needs to struggle alone, to steal and cheat in order to survive. When finally after leaving the tribe she finds a place where she feels protected, warm and fed, she has to face the worst of all - the accusation that she is a witch in league with the devil, working in gypsy witchcraft.. <BR>I have read this book after reading (and tremendously enjoying) \\"Gran at Coalgate\\", a later book of Winifred Cawley's, after which I decided to read her other work. This book indeed benefits from Ms. Cawley's talent and from what I believe is an accurate (and thus very interesting) portrayal of another time and place. However, \\"Feast of the Serpent\\" is not as entertaining as \\"Gran at Coalgate\\" and this is most likely due to the difficult subject of witch hunts, the description of Adonell's lonely struggles and the English background conflicts. Adonell is a young girl and the reader's heart goes out for her. At first we want to see her warm and fed and then, like life, we want her to find happiness and love.  Pretty soon all we want for Adonell is to stay alive. The witch hunt and trials part was rather hard for me to read. Off course it raises rage of the foolishness of people and their need to find a scapegoat.  <BR>All in all, an interesting book and a well written story with difficult parts. Sometimes tedious due to the need to give the reader some more understanding of the background which is done through various conversations. It is not that there are any didactic explanations but somehow the pace of the story is stopped.	2003-05-20

On the contrary, although the book is very readable I found myself sitting on edge wondering what will happen next. What horrible things are now to happen? You expect the worst.<BR>It is not that anything horrible or sickening does happen. This is not a \\"horror\\" book in this sense - the horror is more inside your brain and your uncomfortable feelings. You feel uncomfortable because something wrong is happening and you do not always know how to point it out. <BR>Do you know the feeling you get when you are having a conversation with someone and only after you end the talk you say to yourself that he said or hinted things you should not have tolerated and that you should have reacted differently... or maybe that the message delivered was not what you initially had in mind and then you are very upset at yourself for not crying out and saying this or that...? Well this is my attempt to describe some of the emotions this book has evoked in me. <BR>However, having said this, I think that the uncomfortable feeling is exactly what the writer has tried and succeeded in creating and thus the reading is worthwhile. It is like being in another mind which is both similar and different from your own. So many things are familiar and so many thoughts are thoughts you have thought before; and yet, so many actions and reflections are so totally unusual....so defying . <BR>Natalie, the main character is not someone I like (why? because I cannot understand her; because she upsets me. I kept thinking \\"Can't you see this is dangerous; why aren't you more careful of the other girls... \\" ). However, she seems so troubled you do not want anything bad to happen to her. You also share Natalie's confusion - the theme of \\"did THIS happen or not\\" and \\"am I really here\\" is very strong throughout the book and the reader is a true participant in this sense. You are not sure if the things described did happen or not? If the characters did exist (the girl Tony - is she real or is she an imaginative friend? A close soul mate everyone wishes for, someone who can read your brain, even the hideous things in your mind ) and what are their motives? You can only guess. And maybe nothing really happened? The terror is really subdued and is sometimes conveyed in seemingly innocent (women) conversations. These polite dialogues can be very cruel and someone is sure to be stabbed in the back.<BR>I despised Natalie's father. This person sees everything as a life experience you must endure in order to grow up and be a \\"better person/writer/critic\\" and thus although he can see Natalie has problems in college his only words are that this is a good experience for her. He has no empathy. He is a person which is so self centered he has no time for sympathy / real emotions or real communication. I think that he sees Natalie as his creation and this self centered feeling he confuses with love.  I see the father as the true villain of this book and I blame him for most of the bad things Natalie has to endure.<BR>Natalie is alone in the world (at least this is how she feels). <BR>I am tempted to write \\"aren't we all... \\" - we all spend our lives in trying not to be and this is why Hangsaman is such a troubling story.<BR>Bottom line of this depressing review is that I do reccomend the book. Its a book that stays with you.	2003-04-30

I was drawn to this book from its first line \\"The place I like best in this world is the kitchen\\" -- these simple, even childish words have hooked me to this book. This line and the lines that follow were able to touch a private love of spending time in the kitchen and to present it from a different angle. Food can be a controlled comfort in a chaotic world. \\"Kitchen\\" has been my first Banana Yoshimoto book and I have been reading more of her work ever since. <BR>Kitchen is a special, unique book. Kitchen has a plot and there are \\"things happening\\" in the story. However, the attraction and specialty of the book is not from its content or the flow of the story, but rather the atmosphere it creates, the tender descriptions, and the ability to look inside. I also find it to be a soothing, uplifting book. Life is full of bad events and a person can be drawn to the bottom, overtaken by the burden of living without a close soul. Kitchen deals with sorrow and grievance after death of a loved person, however balances grief with other life forces - power of love, power of friendship and food... an important powerful life force which operates better if it is shared with others. <BR>In this book, as in her other work, Banana Yoshimoto also practices acceptance and tolerance. She describes families,  relationships and behaviours of all kinds and all are perceived as naturally as she portrays them. <BR>It may sound corny but the experience of reading a story held in such a different culture, being able to almost smell and feel the taste of other foods and yet sharethe same emotions is another added value of this book.	2003-04-29

I thought that I am not ready to torment myself with such a dreadful subject; standing in the bookstore  I found myself reading the beginning pages with interest and by the next day read all of Amazon's sample pages. Then I just had to read the rest.<BR>I would like to start out by saying that I have mixed feelings regarding the \\"Lovely Bones\\" on which I will elaborate, but in any case I think this is a reading that is worth your time and only if to raise this important issue. I read the \\"Lovely Bones\\" during the days when Elizabeth Smart, the missing girl, was found alive in Salt Lake City, Utah.  My thoughts about this happy event were entangled with the thoughts I had during \\"The Lovely Bones\\" reading and its issues which deal not only with the dead and the living, family coping strategies and survival methods in general but also brings to mind the issue of missing children and child abuse and even something about the world beyond. Something comforting I might add.<BR>The major surprise of this book is that it is not horrible. The author is able to overcome the major \\"awfulness\\" of the issue by giving you the main facts right out front. Susie is dead. She tells us how it happened and who did it in the beginning pages. The reader will be spared the suspension and the feeling that something bad is going to happen and the hopes that the family will later have  (\\"even if they found an elbow...she can live without a hand...\\" ). I think that being able to deal with this issue in a some-what-matter-of-fact is the major achievement of this book. Not to say that the book is not very emotional, it is. <BR>Also, the book portrays quite well the different coping mechanisms that each family member develops and how such event throws people totally out of balance. Also what an effort it is to continue living - this is especially well portrayed in the father's character that is the most endearing and is very reliable. So is Lindsey and the way having a dead sister affected her growing up and life decisions. However, some of the other relationships (father and mother for example) are not totally reliable and understood (especially not the final reunion).<BR>The book has a major \\"gimmick\\" - it describes the life beyond. The heaven is \\"your personal heaven\\" and I must say this idea has something very comforting in it.  However, this is also a major flaw of the book as once you understand this \\"gimmick\\" you want more. I for example had more questions about Susie. Does she grow up in the world beyond or does she always stay 14? Susie is not critical of anything that goes on in \\"our\\" world although she sees it all. Is this accepting also a part of heaven? She is happy when she is remembered but is she upset when she is forgotten? Or does she learn to control her wants because the frustration of not being able to affect the living will be too great? My questions remained unanaswered. Also, there is some \\"Hollywoodish\\" sense to some parts of the book and especially in the way things fall into place in the end. A good example for this will be Susie \\"falling of the sky\\" - I have to admit I was satisfied for her being \\"alive\\" if only for a few hours, but it was too much for me to take. I can accept \\"mystical\\" but I cannot accept easy solutions. I also have to say that the ending had a sense of \\"life goes on\\" and \\"Susie and family were able to seperate from each other\\". It is surprising to see this notion in a book that understands grief and mourning so well. People say that the pain only grows with time - not the opposite.  These are the low parts of the book which do not match the ability to understand the dynamics of the mourning family, the impact of the dead on the living, and the author ability not to judge and not to condemn anyone for his reactions. In this regard I thought that \\"not catching the murderer\\" was a just decison from the author's side and lends to the books credibility.	2003-03-26
US	43044046	RHHD5K6U6H40Q	0030147719	853745039	Gran at Coalgate	Books	5	5	6	N	N	One of my all time favorites.	What a great great book! I have read this book many years ago in its Hebrew translation and have been searching for an original language copy ever since. I finally succeeded in purchasing this book through Julian Brogi, one of Amazon used book dealers. Reading the book in its original form has been a wonderful, unique experience. The author uses the slang and common language used at the time and place of the book (although the words can be understood from context, the book provides a glossary in the end) and this adds to the total experience of feeling \\"Coalgate\\" in its true form (as far as I understand Coalgate is not a true town, but more a combination of a few coal mining towns but I might very well be mistaken) One short example of the language can be the following arbitrary chosen phrase \\"Ay, I heard, said Mam. Dear knows how it'll all end. What does your man say?' Mr. Park was a pitman. 'Does he think the' really will strike? You couldn't blame them... That old Strike: folks'd been going on about that Strike for weeks. '... but there'll be a bonnie lot hungered if the' do...the bairns...\\" .<BR>The story is about Jinnie Friend, an 11 year old girl who has been feeling bad lately due to her \\"overdoing it\\" in school, following a period of exams. Jinnie is troubled by her worries that she will not get the scholarship she needs for attending the Secondary school on her way to becoming a teacher. Jinnie's dad, the strict Mr. Friend, adds to her worries by claiming a person \\"should stay in the station to which God has called... not try to get above yourself which was a sin...\\" The doctor recommends that Jinnie has a complete change and have a week holiday, and hence Jinnie is on her way to her favorite \\"Gran at Coalgate \\" for a week vacation. What a vacation this turns to be! Coalgate is not like home, with Jinnie's father, who is very strict in religion and does not allow any \\"regular\\" life enjoyments...Gran lets Jinnie to go to the movies, eat fish and chips and even go to a dance, or more a \\"church social\\" as Jinnie constantly reminds herself (so as the word Dance will not slip out of her mouth). Coalgate visit is a \\"growing up\\" experience for Jinnie. She is insulted when treated as a child but can not always understand the grownups and their weird ways. This confusion is very well described and so is the way an 11 year old thinks. The story is also a story of the \\"pitman\\" - the miners and their way of life, described with a loving eye. Daily life is described in detail and so are the family and neighbors surrounding \\"Gran's\\" compassionate, understanding figure. This is a true hard working woman, stable as a rock, who struggles to cut ends and make a living for her family but does not forget for one minute what's important in life. <BR>I can not understand why this book is marked as fitting to ages 4-8. I judge it to be appropriate for young adolescence ages 12-16 and have enjoyed it tremendously as an adult. I am quite positive that younger kids will not be able to understand the story. Also, as the previous reviewer mentioned, there are many nuances you can understand only as an adult and thus, the book is more enjoyable. The author (who has grown up in Northumberland, England) describes the area and its people that have inspired (as the cover says) all her books. Indeed, you can feel how acquainted she is with the place and people and can share the love she feels for them. So be a bonnie lass and get this book for yourself!	2003-03-09
US	43044046	RFKX6H28PJFVL	0152035478	816109731	Angry Arthur	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Destruction - too strong for me	My feelings towards this book are ambivalent. This is not one of my favorite children books - reason being this book deals with destruction and chaos, even the end of the world and for me - with my adult associations, this is very unpleasant. My child however accepts this book \\"as is\\" without questioning for once the reality / validity of the story and the power of Arthur's anger - an anger so destructive it ruins the world(\\"Look mom, his grandma is an astronaut now\\"). The text is very simple and clear and the subject is very close to a child's heart... (\\"when I get mad\\"...)I think that the other reviewers are correct in saying that with the right guidance, an adult can lead the conversation and discussion of the book into an educational experience. I am just uncertain that I wish to do it. I also agree that the topic is very strong and can be related to what anger and hatred can cause - wars in general and the stupidity of man... but do you really want to get into this when you read a bedtime story...?	2003-02-23

When you rate a children book (one that is meant to be read aloud) you rate the book from your point of view as the vocal reader and not necessarily from the kids point of view.   How was the reading from your \\"reading\\" side? is it one of the books you hate having to go through or is it fun for you as well? this book is definitely a \\"10\\" for all participants. The fatigued mother (sorry fathers, the mother is the heroine here), reading the book at the end of her full day and receiving in this book something to address her side and problems (in picture and rhyme) and the child who enjoys reading about other children funny as himself - and always loves to hear about large families. Former reviewers have saluted the rhymes of Mary Ann Hoberman but I would like to honor the great drawings of Marla Frazee. The story evolves from one drawing to the next, through time passing by - portrayed by changing seasons (Summer - bathing in the lake, Autumn - falling leaves), the mother continuous pregnencies, the part of her hobby (playing the chello) in her life - central when she had one child and then forgotten all together (thrown aside) and again appearing in the end of the story. I find it always interesting (and credible) to hear about other people's problems and this is what I feel when I look at the drawings - their house is also in a constant state of a mess (although she does do her best...), the loads of laundry... the ever lasting need to go to the store, fill the house with food (mother and father are again seen with bags of groceries), isn't that what you do all day?  very real and very satisfying. I cannot comment much about the rhymes as I read the (beautiful) Hebrew translation but I am sure the translator had a great original to translate from.... I would like to stress again how I love the REALITY of this book - the kids and the house life are so normal. Nothing too pretty or cute - not the kids (each one with his own personality and each one with his own craving), and not the crowded house - diaper changing on the floor, one kid is in the toilet, seven beds in one room. You might argue about the reality of the ending but this is an ending I am sure we all wish for and a perfect ending to this perfect book.	2003-02-13
US	43044046	R1B3561YENRPN9	0451203771	359050157	Scarlet Feather	Books	2	2	5	N	N	Boring. Such a disappointment.	I had such high expectations from this book - first of all a book about a catering business. Reading about food is something I always enjoy. Second, the plot seemed to be interesting: two young people starting up a new business.... I even bought the hardcover edition. Such a waste of time and money! I had to struggle through the book and could hardly finish the reading. It was SO boring. I know that in real life you get the most unbelievable stories which are true - yes, the weirdest things do happen. But when you read about it in books you are not ready to accept everything - I mean, this family just about goes through everything... a drunk, a crazy mother, a thief, the rich guy marrying the maid's daughter and so on... drama with every character. It is just too much!. Also, there are so many subplots that you loose your focus. The only good thing I can say about this book is that the characters are very vividly portrayed and as a reader they get your sympathy (although you get to see only one dimension of most of them - &quot;bad&quot; is bad and &quot;good&quot; is good...) .Very disappointing.	2003-02-05

I have to admit that I personally am a bit bored reading this book (I am bored with the routine process with all the neighbours until the final solution of painting the house purple is found) and I also do not like the illustrations ( I like more colors....) however, I have to admit that my son loves this book (I translate the book to Hebrew as I go along) and I myself like the author's introduction (\\"am I Mr Pine?...\\") I think its quite sweet, not more then that though. So 4 stars is the average between my son and my ratings.	2003-02-04

This book is so different from all the usual children books you are used to read to your kids. The book is original and different and yet so easy to identify with (we want to stretch the time till bedtime) and to enjoy...The reader has to tell the story as he understands it as the text is very very minimal and basically we see the father declaring how many more minutes till bedtime (all this while reading the newspaper undisturbed!). Meanwhile, a whole \\"summer vacation\\" is rapidly passing through the house when the hamsters are visiting in an organized tour. The tour gets more \\"condensed\\" as bedtime approaches and the story reaches its climax (at least for my son and I ) in the bathtab scene page portraying all the hamsters in what seems to be like the French Riviera in summer.... (am I crazy to sense a little criticisem too or is this page just an honest portrayal of human nature?) very enjoyable to read and check out all the different activities going on and to see \\"the story inside the story\\". I am familiar with Peggy Rathmann's other books and love them as well but this one truly comes from a very creative mind...	2003-02-04
US	43044046	R21F2R9N251EHQ	0345446860	493062492	Back When We Were Grownups: A Novel (Ballantine Reader's Circle)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Real  life.	Rebbecca is not your typical heroine. She is not young, she is not pretty (rather, she is a little overweight), she is an unoticed person, someone who is always taken for granted since she is &quot;always around&quot;. Rebecca is someone you can count on to smooth things over, and to dump the kids on when you are busy. Mostly, Rebecca - compared to many other heroines we know so well - does not feel like she has her whole life in front of her. On the other hand, she looks back at what her life turned to be  and asks herself what happened along the way, and were did the real Rebbecca disappear. This has not turned out as she planned.... When I say that Rebecca is always &quot;there&quot; I mean the &quot;Open Arms&quot;, her house, where she works and lives. This house seems to have a personality of its own and a mood that fits the way Rebecca feels. The way the house is presneted is changed according to what Rebecca feels or thinks at different times - from a place she can no longer bear (the endless repairmen, the endless effort to keep it holding together), a crowded place with no privacy (people always coming in and out) to something very warm and welcoming, very homey and inviting to family members.   Rebecca is full of regets and seems to feel that life has not treated her fairly. Throughout the story Rebecca undergoes a personal quest - to find the &quot;road not taken&quot; by her in her youth and to confront with her choices. I like the fact that the book is about a regular woman with a regular problem - therefore relevant to so many people in so many ways. I like the fact that the book does not try to repeat the slogan of &quot;I don't regret a thing&quot; but does deal with regrets of all kinds and what you choose to do with them. Rebecca's character is also lovable for being such an accepting person, a person that makes life easier for others, and after criticizing herself for this &quot;flaw in character&quot; (why don't I ever say what I think) learns to accept herself the way she accepts others. She is the perfect mother without being a real mother to three of her four daughters. You, as the reader are part of the inner process Rebecca is undergoing and you are not spoon fed her conclusions but grow together with her. I gave this book a 4 stars as the book is not &quot;thrilling&quot; or &quot;perfect&quot;. It is a realistic story, very touching and very human and is very sure to emphesize the fact that life too is not perfect....	2003-01-29

Such a nice way to say \\"everyone on his own time\\" without having to spell it out. Jose Aruego's paintings are colorfull, happy and full of expressions.

This book, like many other Anthony Brown's books has several layers - the text, and the beautiful drawings who add to the text, but give further layers of understanding and emphasizes the message. The mother who is being \\"walked all over\\" in the beginning of the book does not stay passive and takes some action - she leaves the house and from here the road to \\"living like pigs\\" is very short, until she comes back, but now on her own terms. So nice for me, as a mother to read this book to my kids and to see how the message comes across without me saying anything...	2003-01-21

You read the book feeling breathless, you do not have air and all you want is for Kate to have some rest - but does she really want to rest? do you? and what will your life look like if you did? You think that this book is not going to give you any surprises and yes, it is what you expect - you are acquainted with the daily routine - but there is an added value. The book is funny, sad, makes you angry, is thought provoking - and is also able to put into words all the things you know in heart but are often not able to word to yourself (you don't have time...).  These are the issues of all your discussions with your girlfriends and any other women. I think by the way that the book is relevant to all mothers, not just the working mothers. The guilt feeling is a close partner of all of us and is a central theme in the book. I waited anxiously for the ending to see what is - and can there be - a solution. I have to say I was somewhat disappointed. Some of the ending (and also the Bunce case) are not totally realistic, I think that a realistic ending is a continuous struggle with the price you have to pay (your own health for example). Nevertheless I give this book a 5 stars rating because it was so enjoyable, so relevant to me and my friends and so stays with me for a long time.	2003-01-16

My son (5) and I love this story and so does any kid I read this story to. We love it mostly because of the beautiful drawings (some sad, some funny) which are sensitive and full of little details that enrich the tale. Check out the incredible caged sad monkey (no need of words) or the funny \\"Super Gorilla\\" picture. We also like the text that is simple and straightforward on one hand but relies heavily on the pictures for further layers of understanding. Adults can argue about the subject of this story - I personally think it is about human relations (what's important) - but heard other say it is about fear (?) but all this is unimportant - kids and adults alike are drawn to the amazing drawings and can sense the richness of this book. Gorillas are sure to become your favorite animals.	2003-01-16

Simple lovely drawings (I like the dinner page with the specific count of food items).	2003-01-16

I would say that it is more bizarre then horror - it may be horrible in the sense that the thoughts that go through people's minds do not stay in the form of \\"thoughts\\" but get carried out. The book is presented from the eyes of Merricat and the reader is left to guess if she is retarded, slow, or someone with witchcraft powers as she would like to think - but however \\"weird\\" Merricat is, the reader can identify and even sympethize with her feelings, with the whole spectrum of her feelings: her love and loyalty to Constance and her hatred and anger towards other people. The reader recognizes that what goes on in Merricat's head is not totally unfamiliar.... Also, however \\"weird\\" the castle may be it is still a home and a very secure loved home and this feeling comes out of the story - so there is also something very surprisingly cozy about this castle and this comes from the portrayal of constance's cooking, the stored food, daily routine. I think I love this book because it shows you CAN live in a bubble you create and that you make your own reality... Also a very good portrayal of human flaws.	2003-01-14

I find this book too politicly correct,  so much trying to be &quot;correct&quot; that it isn't interesting, it does  not deal with real people. This book is too schematic, with the same  stereotyped characters - one &quot;good&quot; &quot;ideal&quot; family  (Iggies's) one &quot;bad&quot;  family with all the old fashioned ideas and  the one in the middle - the writer's family.
