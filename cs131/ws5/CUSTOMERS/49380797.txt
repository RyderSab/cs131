Wolfe Automotive Industries is making something more than money, and that's enemies.  Tomalis Wolfe is trying to hold his empire down and his family together, however fractured they may be.  With a wife sexing his employees, an estranged daughter who cannot be in the same room with her mother, and a son whose producing more children than profits, his patience is being taxed.  The office is not that much better.  His right hand man, Bradford, is secretly trying to sell the man's company right out from under him, and is using another company employee, the lovely Anastacia, as a prostitute for visiting clients.  Add the faithful secretary Diana and her secret crush who works in the parking garage and the their secrets, and it's a free-for-all for who can catch sanity by the leg first!  The climax is the company Christmas party that wraps up more than the gifts under the tree.  It has got to be the best party that I have ever read about.  It makes you wish that you could have attended and stayed sober, just so you wouldn't have missed anything!  The best aspect of this novel is that sex wasn't the driving plot.  Greed, ambition, honesty, and other factors worthy of a good soap opera made this book more than just another page-filled sexapade.  Loved it!	2004-03-11

Reporter Joe Tinker is a sportswriter, when not drinking, sleeping around, or stumbling into crimes scenes, who can get the job done-when he's ready to get to it.  The year is 1947, and Joe's latest assignment is to follow and interview Jackie Robinson in Cuba during baseball practice for the Brooklyn Dodgers.  Making history as baseball's first black player is making waves around the world, and with all of the hate mail that Jackie has received, it's Joe that stumbles into a racial plot to have the ballplayer assasinated on the field of the first game.  The author has blended history with fiction very well, except that the coincidences that led Joe to the murder in the making was very contrived.  Pushing that to the side, it wasn't so much a mystery as it was slightly lopsided action novel with a better view of how hate can manifest itself to take over one's life. Pretty good.	2004-03-11

YO YO LOVE examines the dating scene of Kayla Johnson, a regular college student who only wants one thing in this world-a &quot;boo&quot;.  Herein lies the problem.  When your standard are not clearly defined, then whom ever comes your way, will look good.  Kayla's wasn't, because if he has a heartbeat, it all gravy.  After dealing with a string of losers, handsome and well-to-do Wil shows his face and makes her days and nights worth living.  What Wil didn't tell Kayla is that his love comes with baggage that may not be that easy to leave behind, and it's heavy enough that she may have to look at fella number two, Samir, who ain't playing in the perfect league himself.  Kayla choices may not be the brightest ones, but her decisions are the heart of the story, especially when she's too willing to risk her heart and her self-respect for someone who only cares about his own.

Barry White's life wasn't all love and togetherness as his many hits have prescribed to any lovers out there, but still, having fought his way out of poverty by binding his love of life with his true love of music paved the way to him becoming the icon he will always be.  Yeah, there may be a little ego, but he deserves it.  Barry's struggle from Compton to being swindled as an employee of a toy store to the dissolution of his first marriage may have broken his spirit, but made him a better man.  The most interesting part of his life was the business aspect, especially the parts that dealt with the record company dismissing him and not wanting to acknoledge his gifts, yet reaping the millions of dollars he was making them.  Filled with highs and lows, this autobiography wasn't the best I ever read, but made the closer look at Barry's life intriquing.	2004-01-03

What put her in there for a little over 10 years was what the doctor's contributed to having constant, vivid dreams about her ancestor coming to America on one of the slave ships, and her grandmother's life with her grandfather.  The reality of the situation was that Lizzie was having out of body experiences and being transplanted back to the bodies of these people and being able to see their lives played out without being able to control their bodies.  This abililty was blessed (or cursed) from her contact with her grandmother's quilt that was left to her after her death.  To complicate matters further, everytime she find herself back in the past,  the scars that her great-great-great grandmother received as punishment while she was a slave, begin to appear on Lizzie's back and the shackles that bound her on the slave ship now appears as red circular sores around Lizzie's wrists.  Her parents think she's cutting herself and the psychiatrists think that reality is too hard for her to live in, so what is she to do?  This book would have been better if the timelines had been placed in order instead of jumping from one point in time to another.  Repetitive, slightly confusing, and deeper than a drinking well, this book is for those mindset runs on an more expanded level, and definitely need something to invest in.	2003-12-17

Her rational is that once the sex is over (if sex is involved), just leave the money and jewelry on the table and I'll collect it later.  What she won't admit is that she is running on the same track as a high priced call girl.  What she doesn't realize is that the track is getting a little crowded with a stalker forcing her hand and threating Marissa to leave her husband alone, or else she's dead meat.  Levi, the handyman that is attracted to Marissa, but she can't see him because of his lack of a good car and money, is the only line of defense against this enemy that neither can see, but is still out there somewhere.

Granted, I am not a big fan of Ms. Naylor's books, but it was something about this one that made me think twice.  I found it to be a quick and enjoyable read.  The best part was that it wasn't a complete story so much as updates of a few of the men who inhabited Brewster Place, even if it was for a short time.  The highlights were bringing back Basil, who ran out on his mother after she paid his bail and stayed on the run for years, finally coming home after her death and wanting to atone for his misdeeds by trying to reform a young mother of two, who has no parenting skill at all.  Next, CeCe Baker is captured and interrogated by the police for a murder done for the loyality of his gang.  Eugene makes a return to explain why his marriage to Ceil was off and on, until the day came he could no longer return to her and be the husband she deserved.  Ben also makes an apperance for a couple of stories, even though he was killed in THE WOMEN OF BREWSTER PLACE.  Among these gems are short stories of new characters that are as varied in personality and lifestyles, yet all are a part of the neighborhood that will soon be destroyed as part of campaign for renovations.  The short story format may put off some readers, others will find it a necessary evil to keep up updated on those familar stomping grounds that became so famous years ago.	2003-10-10

As a child performing on the TED MACK AMATEUR HOUR, a star was being groomed, but the pitfalls that she encountered while the Pips were being formed, from racism to the sexual attack, left a mark that made her stronger wtih each day that went by.

It seems that Berry Gordy and Diana Ross had other plans for the group, and the company made a few rules along the way on how they would be paid.  Leaving Motown would be the biggest feather in their caps and the best part was when nobody looked back.  She also clear up what went on behind the SISTERS IN THE NAME OF LOVE showcase, the &quot;who discovered The Jackson Five&quot; debate, and the dissolving of her three marriages.

Nikki does some background history on her friend and finds out that she never had a degree, but she had a position in the finance department of the university.  She had a connection with several major players on the campus that she kept to herself, and a disk that held several discrepencies between what was and wasn't counted with the school's budget.  These contradictions and how they surrounded Rozella is what propels this mystery along.  It's not enough that Nikki's former boyfriend, Dante, moves back into her life, but the fact that he is living in the same building makes it too close for comfort, adding the sexual tension.  Again, the book is a long one, and the spaces between the mystery and the ex's can be a little too much at times, but it introduced a new mystery sleuth in a new atmosphere loaded with numerous cracks in the armor, hopefully bringing forth numerous stories.	2003-10-08

The repair of the house they shared together bring into her life Randall, a carpenter and renovator who owns his own business, and after a few awkward dates, a little piece of Sandy's heart.  It's during this time that Adrian's brother, Winston, has shared his buried feelings for his sister-in-law.  He doesn't want her to forget his brother, but he does want her to start over with him in her life.  The best part of this story is that the triangle is filled with real feelings and fears of things that they don't fully understand.  Another plus is that the players in this plot are not branded &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;, because each one has traits that we may not always agree with, and that makes them human.  Add best friends Martha, who is trying to stay in control of her relationship with the use of a know-it-all attitude and alcohol. Janice, who is driving her man away with her obsessive streak of finding proof her faithful boyfriend is constantly cheating on her.  Last, Britney, who is unexpectantly pregnant and find the well running dry on her and the hubby's finances, due to his insistance on not letting her work, so she can be a stay-at-home mom.

A LONG WAY FROM HOME caught my interest because it read like threee different stories surrounding three generations of women who lived on the same plantation, yet saw their world in three different ways.  Suzie is a slave and she can't see any other life outside of working for white people, and why should she when she was born the daughter of slaves and was raised that way.  Her perception is that blacks are safer having masters.  Her daughter Clara run on a slightly different track.  Having a mother who lives in the big house is a pretty big deal, and when that house is occupied by the former president James Madison, then life can be tolerated.  It's also not her fault that she was also born of fair skin and long hair.  She sees slavery from the perception of someone who has never had to work the fields or lives in the rundown houses her friend's parents have to.  She actually wonder why they don't just move to better quarters.  Later on, we meet Clara's daughter Susan, and her lifestyle is taken when she is sold to a family in another state, a life that become more complicated when she suspects that the head of the household might be her father.  Susan becomes the caretaker of the grandchildren living there and sees her role in life ever diminishing, until she meet a free black man, papers and all.  It's then she opens her eyes and focuses on her role in this world as a black women with her mother's features, especially with slavery about to be abolished and her charges not willing to let her go.  Books that use slavery as a focus point are not my cup of tea and I usually let them pass, however, this novel reads very smoothly and showcases three women at different points of life during a very turbulant timeframe, all wanting to do one thing-survive the best way they know how.

To make sure that he remains in the cash and to satisfy a urge to play chance, he makes side bets on basketball games with the help of a bookie meadiated by his friend and former teammate, Metz.  Chance plays a heavier hand in Hunter's life when buddy Metz takes his latest cash bet from Hunter and places every dime on the Titans to win their latest game.  The amount betted alerts Tony Rizzo, ganster and begging to be leader of his uncle's mafia family, to tail Metz and discover Hunter's involvement, then blackmail him into a points shaving racket that will involve Tony going to the owner of the Titans and exposing him to the NFL if he doesn't comply.  Need more incentive, then how about killing Hunter's wife, then his daughter?  What neither realizes is that Ellis Cook, FBI agent and leader of a mob task force, is trailing Tony and looking for evidence to send him to prison and close down the connecting families operating in New York.  What Cook doesn't realize is that within the walls of the FBI, a traitor is spilling the developments of the impending case against Tony to his uncle, Vincent Mondolffi, one of the ruling families.  The mole is easy to figure out, but the development of the story is not, and just when it looks like there is no way out, another door opens and the suspense kicks in on another level.

SHAME ON IT ALL focuses on the Whitfield sisters; Harmony, the oldest, is dealing with issues surrounding her abrupt breakup with her boyfriend, Zachary.  The middle girl, Bryce, is slightly kinky and attracted to a man that she positively hates. Lucinda, aka Lucky, has a one-night stand with the dean at the college she attends.  What should have been forbidden turns frighting when she is caught up in a cycle that only he can release her from, but will he?  Included are two entertaining back-up female players. Harmony's best friend, Fatima, is seeking a divorce from her cheating husband by asking Harmony for a very unusual request, and Collette, Bryce's number one gal pal, who only want men who will take care of her and are socially out of her reach.  The men in this book aren't just window decoration. They have purpose and personalities, and they compliment the ladies in a way that make them stronger.  This novel runs on a different track than ADDICTED, but is just as entertaining.	2003-03-26

LIAR'S GAME wasn't the worst to come out of Eric Jerome Dickey, but it wasn't the best, either.  Close to 30, Vince Browne goes club-hopping and meet the beautiful Dana, who eyes him and loves what she sees in return.  While getting to know each other, Vince leaves and/or denies a few details that Dana would have found useful when deciding whether or not to spend time with him.  Whether he had any children or had he had any significant relationship that could come back to haunt him were first and foremost in her mind.  He reassures her \\"no\\", when the reality of the situation is that he not only has a child, but an ex-wife who cheated on him while they were married, and he still has an evil grudge.  Don't feel so sorry for her, because she brings more excess baggage than Santa Claus, and she keep her mouth shut also.  It's throughout this relationship that the truth seeps out in little quantities, until the point when the dam burst and the pasts of both our main characters are lying around their feet like debris.  Whether they are able to pick up the pieces and put them together to fit or walk over and break them even further is for you to read, however, it won't be an easy job.  Both of these characters are so fractured by their past that it kinda makes it very difficult to like each one, must less root for their love.

He accepts, adding on that it can't lead anywhere because he's moving on to his new life.  She understands and agrees.  BIG MISTAKE!  What Michael Baisden has done is taken the formula for one night stands and turned it on it's ear.  Being a fan of the movie FATAL ATTRACTION, this book was even more pleasing because it involved african-americans and the dangers involved with the \\"wham, bam, thank you, 'mam\\" formula.  Olivia was a true nemesis for our hero, both unstable, yet very intelligent in her methods, and anyone reading this novel will get caught up in the feel of the chase, and the torment when caught.

When Anthony Poole started throwing his \\"playa\\" lines on Sharron Francis, little did he know that he would open a box filled with more than the physical could offer.  SWEET ST. LOUIS put these two people together and gave the reader the blow-by-blow description of their obivious attraction to each other and what happens when curiousity of sex becomes commitment of love, especially when that option wasn't in the initial making.  Of course, there are the foils that appear in every love story, and Anthony's cousin (who seems to worship Anthony to the point where he actually models his own life to mirror \\"Ant's\\"), and Sharron's roommate, Celina (who lives her life as the proverbial female playa-get what you can, then move on, even if you have to date two or three at a time) seems to fit the bill..  The main problem with this story is that while the cast of characters were beliveable, the relationship was marred with insistant thought checks and reasons why they made each and every move.  It seems that the only thing these two did was try to second-guess the other, and I know that it's best to be careful and not get your heart caught up in something that could be nothing, but it also took away the feeling of chance and the thrill of the \\"maybe\\" that exist when dating.

The murder Thai commits will send him outside the neighborhood he knows to unfamilar territory in North Carolina, where an eclectic group of strangers will show him that in each man lies good and bad, and how you live will determine your destiny.

A hard-working african-american woman and a italian waiter meet after her being stuck in a snowstorm in Roanoke, VA, and from there, the seeds of love were just being planted.  Neither one of them knew it yet, but that storm would change their lives.  It was realistic about the opposition from his father and her mother, and even though Jay was stronger in his conviction of love for her, Renee had enough self-doubt to lend this story true credibility.  It's all about how much you are willing to give of yourself and how hard you are willing to fight, just to stake your claim at happiness.  The best part of this novel is the characterization of Renee.  I don't know if Mr. Murray lived around african-americans for an extended amount of time, or if it is in fact that his wife is black, but he hit the nail dead center on how to interpret Renee.  The mannerism were so in touch and on point, it was almost scary to think that this book was written by a white man. Definitely talented, Mr. Murray gets my vote to support a second novel.

Everything would be okay with this scenerio, if Davis wasn't already married to stuck-up socialite Veronica. One thing that can be said about this novel is that there are no pretenses among the characters.  Zola knows about Davis wife, and his other lovers at other ports, which is why she keeps Jabar, her slightly doofy, yet constantly horny side dish around.  Davis knows that the only reason Zola's sleeping with him is to stay at the head of the publication and to keep the finances coming, so it's okay with him.  Raymond has left his partner Trent because of an infidelity and walked into this circus that is causing more problems, especially when Basil pops back into the scene and feelings are starting to re-develop.  Each one of these characters continue to move on in chaotic fashion, until a point is reached where they must pay the piper and face what they each are hiding from each other and themselves.

For example, Stephan has at least four or five girlfriends at one time, and that makes him seem like a dog, until you look at how his father taught him.  You still don't agree, yet you understand and don't hate him for it.  Darnell is trying to love his wife the best he can, yet it's Tammy that supports him with his future as a writer, not his wife.

This novel was good, yet it really took me aback, because I didn't know that the sex scenes were more or less graphic, depending on which side of the fence you sit on.  It didn't disturb me, it just suprised me.  Instead of notes and comments from the author found in the back, a centerfold would have fit in better. The story iteslf chonicled the love of Jada and Wellington and the soap opera factors that usually come in between such a couple.  I would have given it five stars, but certain aspects of the novel came into play that I couldn't get past.  During the threesome, it didn't seem like Jada to want to participate with a woman who she felt was after her man to begin with.  Then, when reading, there seem to be a lot of conversation, but lapses in time.  The dialogue would begin in the penthouse and would not take a break, yet the writer states in the next line that the conversation had continued out to the character's cars.

I have read about five or six of Dean Koontz novels and I must have been lucky, because each one took my interest within the first chapter. With this book, the first chapter took me, but the chapters after that grabbed me by the collar and dragged me along like a ton of concrete. It took to page one hundred to kick into some kind of suspense and fifty to seventy-five more pages to get to the next plot, and from there, it was all I could do to keep reading. It wasn't a bad book, it just took too long to get to, well, anywhere. The monsters introduced were grotesque enough, but to have to be introduced to them within the last quarter of the book didn't make the grade for me. On top of that, questions remained that weren't cleared up, like why was Toby affected by the aliens and not his parents? Was it because he was a child and his mind was not fully developed, or was it something dealing with his subconcious? Only if you have time to waste and you have got to read something, ANYTHING, then here's the book for you.	2001-09-20

Meet Socrates Fortlow, a man who served years of prison time for the deaths and rape of a young couple, getting out of prison and trying to adjust to life on the outside as well as trying to come to terms with the life he led before and during his incarceration. During this fourteen short story run, the supporting cast are just as strong as they are flawed, much like Socrates himself. It was this character trait that kept me reading until the end. Socrates lived a hard life and he paid the price for it, however, throughout this book, his anger and resentment has made him not only a heroic figure, but a tragic one as well. Where else can you come across a man that will put together a plan to run a drug dealer out of his neighborhood, and the next story will have him standing in the face of one of his friends and tell him that he will stab him in the back to get with his wife and kids if he doesn't straighten up and fly right? It's these complex traits that make Mr. Fortlow such a facinating character, and this a facinating book.	2001-09-09

Here is a novel that covers a side of african-american life that is not covered often, and the sad part is that it still exists today.  The Giles family, ruled by matriarch Eulelie, are the upper crust, light-skinned blacks that are thrown into a tailspin when perfect (and only) son Gilbert comes home and announces to his uptight brood that he is getting married to Sandra Hightower, the darker-skinned daughter of blue collar workers.  Needless to say, the Giles are not happy about that.  Not only did he have the nerve to marry a girl outside of his presumed pedigree, but her parents had the nerve not have any title to bring to the table.  Reading how Mrs. Giles and her spoiled daughters talked down about the future in-law was bad enough, but trying to break them up to save Gil really took the cake.  Further into the story, Eulelie's past catches up to her in the form of Sandra's mother, and from there, the story goes into a deeper frame of mind that some readers may take as boring filler, but it takes a closer look at the characters involved and explores the true meaning of the word 'privilege'.

MILK IN MY COFFEE was good enough for four stars, but didn't earn enough points for five, because the majority of the gripping storylines involved parties that didn't include the relationship of the main characters. Jordan and Kimberly's interracial involvement was interesting, but it didn't seem to have been as in depth as I would have hoped.  This was Jordan's first time being involved with a white woman, so his feelings, both emotionally and socially, were covered at surface level.  Kimberly's thoughts and feelings were not covered at all.  It was all good to her.  At the end of the book, I read why, and I  saw it as a cop-out.  Eric took the easy way out with Kimberly and that left me feeling a little flat.  The storylines that involved Jordan's search for his missing brother, Kimberly's missing husband, and J'nette's pregnancy were very well crafted and will have the reader turning pages to find the resolution to these issues, but when the main story takes a back seat to the subplots, then it's time to re-evaluate.	2001-06-30

The story involves Chaym Smith, who offers himself as a decoy/stand-in to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., because he bears too familiar a resemblence to the good Doctor.  Told from the perspectives of Dr. King and one of his aides, Matthew Bishop, the novel took us from marches to meetings involving heads of state to the breakdown of Chaym's personality, which was a complete 360 degrees from that of man he was hired to impersonate.  The author was able to structure the personalities of the players involved and made the fictional charaters of Matthew and Chaym convincing and compelling.  However, the book was so weighed down with thoughts and agendas that were so complex in context, that it was a little hard to get back on track, especially when you have forgotten where you left off, and you are still reading the book.

The author's first mystery, SOMEBODY ELSE'S CHILD, was a excellent introduction to Theresa Galloway, her husband Templeton, children Aisha and Shawn, and her demanding, familiar mother.  BLOOD WILL TELL continues the Galloway series by keeping all of the performers in perfect characterization and by throwing in a mysterious love child in the mix, which leads to theft, spying, and murder.  The book was fast-paced and smart, without a lot of ultra-heroics thrown in.  With what Theresa had to endure with her pressure-cooker job, her husband's failing business, and her over-opinioned mother calling the shots behind her back, she didn't need it.  This was a fun book that won't take long to read, and, hopefully, will expand into several more mysteries involving this group of delightful characters.	2001-03-14

BABY OF THE FAMILY read like two seperate novels, and that was a problem for me.  The first few chapters dealt with Lena's sixth sense and I was captivated.  Then, the book shifted into a coming of age story that took up the majority of the novel.  Lena's powers were not addressed anymore until the last three chapters, and by then, I didn't care anymore.  Had the novel stayed true to the plot, I am sure it would have been a great read, but because it deviated and didn't jump back on track until the end, the entire novel was a let down.	2001-03-14

BLUE COLLAR BLUES had a lot of interesting moments, however, because of the technical aspects of the automobile industry, it slowed me down.  The characters were slightly one-dimensional and there were moments where it seemed like I was reading a dime-store romance novel, due to the dialogue between certain characters.  It also seemed to have spasms of time displacement.  Certain pivotal scenes took place between chapters (sometimes between paragraphs) that the author had to inform the reader about because it wasn't inserted within the the story.  It was a little like QUANTUM LEAP.  Although this novel didn't affect me like ONE BETTER, it still had enough to offer.	2001-02-05

TEMPEST RISING didn't hold or keep the pace as well as TUMBLING, but it made for a good story.  The true stars were Ramona and Mae.  There was enough tension between these two to light a christmas tree.  Shern, Victoria, and Bliss' story was interesting, but with out the aunts and uncles, it wouldn't have carried much weight for me.  Ramona and Mae had a relationship built on resentment, but once the background story kicked in, everything was understood.  The ending didn't satisfy me, especially with Mae's treatment of her daughter, but I guess I couldn't have everything.  A good filler for slow times.	2001-02-02

A DAY LATE AND A DOLLAR SHORT introduces us to Viola and Cecil, an older, married couple on their way out.  She is demanding and hard, while he is with a younger woman with three kids of her own.  The children are just as wacked out. Paris can see nothing but her own success in front of her, while Charlotte resent her older sister's accomplishment. Lewis is book smart, but dumb in his choices concerning his life.  Janelle is the baby of the family, and unfortunately, conducts her life as such.  Not a wise thing to do while raising a pre-teen.  The drama level is played to the hilt and the tensions run fast and furious, yet they sincerely care and love each other.  Even if you can't relate to the situations they experience, there is still a factor there that you know someone that conducts themselves the same way these characters do!  Sounds like the mark of a great book to me.  Bravo, Terry!	2001-02-02

WARM HANDS tell the story of one woman's struggle to find the perfect love to complement her life and make her world whole, yet found that the only one who could do that was looking back at her from her mirror.  Sometimes, it is easy to forget we must acheive happiness by making ourselves happy.  This book was filled with a lot of self-awareness and insight on how people can find total happiness just by making sure we take to time to heal our wounds first, and not to cover them up with meaningless relationships and a lot of leftover baggage.  This book was deep in context, yet didn't preach on every other page.  Definitely for those who want a love story with complexities and real issues.	2001-02-02

Starting with my grading scale of 5 stars are the stories by E. Lynn Harris and Marcus Major.  Both included major characters with lots of personality and strong stories.  Both should have been complete novels, because they ended too soon.  The Eric Jerome Dickey story earned 4 stars because the major players were interesting, yet the romance seemed forced.  The search for the embezzler had my attention, and his comuppance at the end was well deserved.  The Colin Channer story was a 2.  The story was very deep.  Too deep.  There can't be a nuclear warhead anywhere buried as deep as this story.  Too much description of everything surrounding Patience, Michael, and Mia, and the endless flashbacks (some interesting) made for a very long short story.  All in all, there is something for everyone.	2001-02-01

It was more on how to create and maintain a better defense, because the real games took place off of the basketball floor.  Aside from the undercover takeover of the New York Flyers, the personal lives of the players and the wives were just as messy and convoluted as the local tabloids.  In short, this was a juicy novel to sink your teeth into if you want your chaos with a storyline.  I had hoped that characters such as Coach &amp; Alexis Mitchell and Jake the attorney would have been given more background story dealing with their past, still, this was a pretty good book and I would recommend it.	2001-01-08

The second installment to HE SAID, SHE SAID was all BeBe-brash and full of attitude!  It was just the way that I liked it.  Throw Issac and daughter Dashay into the mix and the entire book was filled with plenty laughs and honest feelings.  Isaac and BeBe's love affair wasn't easy, and I am glad that it wasn't. It would not have been as interesting if it was a easy ride.  The supporting characters supplied enough substance to make the main characters whole and complete.

Pearl Cleage's novel is about how your life can change course after you have set the destination.  Once you have arrived, it doesn't seem so bad after all.  The heorine, Ava, realized that being HIV-positive does not mean that her life will end at that moment.  In fact, thanks to Eddie and his love for her, it can go on because she now has someone to live for, and when all is said and done, how many of us can truly say the same?  The rest of the book showcased her sister, Joyce, and her determination to fill the void in her life left behind by her deceased family, the slow destruction of her old neighborhood, and memorable antagonists in the guise of Frank, his sister Mattie, and the Anderson family.  This novel was about fighting for what you want and if it will be appreciated when received.	2000-12-24

MAINTENANCE MAN was one of those guilty pleasures that you know isn't your cup of tea, but you can't wait until the last drop!  This book had it's share of minor typos and quick shifts from one scene to another, but I didn't care.  I read it in three days and loved every minute of it.

Brian Keith Jackson's THE VIEW FROM HERE was a very poinant novel that both heart and struggle as the main characteristics.  The fact that the story was being told from the most unlikely of sources gave the entire situation a new perspective.  Talk about your third parties!  Anna's made her entire life her husband and children, and when she had all her decisions made by her husband, her independence was stripped.  I was glad to see that she regained her spirit and her strength in the end, and that the resolution of her dilemnas were all resolved when the blinders were taken off and her head and heart started make her own decisions.  This one is worth the effort.  Thanks, Brian!	2000-12-11

BIRDS OF PREY trade paperback explains just how different, yet similar both the Black Canary and Oracle are.  Seperate, they are formidable.  Together, they are deadly.  I have the MANHUNT mini-series and the REVOLUTION saga, so I just enjoyed the origin of the partnership between the two and the extra story with Lois Lane.  Just so you know, I collect the monthly comic as well.  These two characters have something special and they compliment each other well.  For all action junkies looking for something different, this is your book.  After all, it's not everyday that two beautifully drawn women take center stage to save the world and kick butt until their ankles are sore.  Maybe it should be.	2000-12-04

It was only 107 pages, yet with all of the brutality inflicted upon the Jewish community by the Nazis, it just seemed longer.  The torture boggled my mind and left me dazed.  Mr. Wiesel has my ultimate respect for being able to surive such a tramatic experience.  Such conditions would have cracked many strong men, but he was blessed to be able to survive and share his story with the world.  His is a spirit of strength and this is a story that will not be forgotten.	2000-12-04

THE HARRIS MEN is a book that all men should read, especially any that have had to live without a father in their household.  Although I had mine with me until the day he passed on, I still felt the effects of the Harris brothers and could relate on each level to each one.

ONE  BETTER led the reader from one situation to another without the constant  flashback, which made it a very good read.  The only thing this book gave  me was a bad case of the flashbacks.

FLIGHT OF THE BLACKBIRD&quot; is a novel about strength, perseverence, and love, and how everything that was once lost can be found again.  I thought  that there was nothing left for this family, and then another tragedy  brought about newfound priorities and stronger family ties.  The best part  of this book was that it was so real.  Downsizing is a part of the  corporate structure, and people cope in different ways.  This family, to  me, took it too lightly, and the walls fell it-HARD!  It was a very  powerful novel and I enjoyed it throughly.	2000-08-21

LOVE LIKE GUMBO was good enough for three stars, and that is only because  Grace's need to be independent and her wacky family helped to place it at  that rating.  Aside from that, this had to be the only book that had more  words than WAR AND PEACE!  The structure of the book was definitely  erratic, and there is such a thing as too much description.  2-4 pages to  describe one thing is not a book to recommend to Evelyn Wood.  It took me  two weeks to read the book completely.  Not a personal best.

Overall, the main character was  interesting enough to keep me glued to the story, however, his indecision  about the women in his life gave me a slight headache. He had no specific  clue about what he was looking for in a mate and it truly cast him in a  slightly wimpy light. Overall, his rise to the top and his adventures in  radioland held my interest and rooted for him when he finally made it. A  leisurly read on slow days.	2000-07-23

The two most important novels depicting teenage life in the fast lane are THE COLDEST WINTER EVER by Sister Souljah and this novel. The scariest thing is I know females who live the same way and that their stories may  probably end the same way. The greatest appeal of this novel and Souljah's  is that they relate to us on a level that if we have never been there  before, we know someone who has, and that is a rare gift in itself. A true  classic in urban literature.	2000-07-23

Books that catch the hint and kick into high gear at the middle/end of the book seem to be stuck with me as the caretaker. This book was no exception. UGLY WAYS was a novel that had a good premise, but kept it going on a very  slow pace, until the funeral parlor scene, when it really got hilarious!  That was the best part of the book. Mudear should have been on the cover  instead of her daughters, because she was the scene stealer. She may have  many misunderstanding about her girls, but she still loved them, and when  all is said and done, who could ask for anything more? I could. I could  have asked for a better book, but at least Mudear saved the day. The ironic  part is she had to be dead to do it!	2000-07-22

SUNDAY, YOU LEARN TO BOX was a touching story and a good book centering around Louis Bowman, a teenager learn to cope and deal with his sexuality and his unsupportive parents trying to make him more masculine by teaching  him how to box and defend himself. A coming-of-age story designed to follow  Louis through the pains of what cruel teenagers are capable of, first  crushes, curious sexual attractions, and supporting your own inner being,  this book was a worthwhile trip.	2000-07-22

The ONLY reason I am giving this book two stars is because when the affair was exposed, the emotional turmoil began. That part was very interesting. After that, there  was nothing to invest in because there was nothing left. The title should  have been renamed, well, I can think of a few choice words to use on the  cover. Believe me, PRIDE wouldn't have made the list.	2000-07-22

DOUBLE DEAD didn't have the same, I don't know, something, that COLD MEDINA had, but overall, I didn't care, because this novel was still as perfect as the first, just on a diferent level.  My sister read this novel  and went crazy about it.  The romance between the lawyer and the mistress  may have been a little, well, contrived, but the action and mystery came  directly from the movies, directed by John Woo.  Totally caught up!  Will  get the third novel--hope it lives up to the high standards that Mr.  Hardwick has already established for himself.	2000-07-22

The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon was good, but not great. I was looking for more and didn't get it. In any Stephen King novel, there is a bit of the supernatural that drives the book forward. I didn't get it here, so I was  let down. However, it was still a good book and recommended for those  looking for a safe read.	2000-07-22

COLD MEDINA was the first book by Gary Hardwick that I was introduced to and I'm grateful for it!  The story of the drug cold medina and the side effects, the killer known as Handyman, and Inspector Tony Hill thrown  together made each and every page a true experience.  This was one of the  best suspense novels I have ever read.  Gary, can ya write another Hill  story?  Pretty Please?	2000-07-22

SEDUCED took it's time to get where it was going, but when it did, it made up for it's slow pace with gripping story and complex characterization. Not one of the best book that I have read, it gripped me with it's world of  music and success and how it doesn't always mix. All in all, it turned out  to be a good book.	2000-07-22

With URBAN ROMANCE, it took a little longer to get the story going, but because I paid for the book, I decided to keep going. It definitely got better, but  it would have been better to not spend so much time on slow introductions  of the major players. Sometimes, that can wear the story down quicker than  a three course meal. Still, a good book	2000-07-22

MEN CRY IN THE DARK had it's share of typos and more than a little erratic, but, it was very enjoyable and true to what some brothers think and how they live.  Each of the men in this book was someone that I knew or  associated with and it felt very real.  I recently purchased MAINTENANCE  MAN and can only hope that this novel can capture my interest just as well.	2000-07-21

Characters, I  might add, that deserved more than others. Overall, I hope that her second  novel has more consistancy in pacing and characters than this debut novel.	2000-07-21

LINDEN HILLS was a very involved novel that bordered on lost and found.  I was lost on several chapters and found my way back in the next.  The story of blacks who made it and the blacks who hadn't was a good one, however,  the point would have been better if it hadn't dragged on for so long with  filler chapters and constant talking between the lines.  Still, only if you  have the time to kill, should you give it a try.	2000-07-20

BAILEY'S CAFE would have been better if the characters and situations had not been described to death! The people that frequently this establishment were interesting enough, but when they are described to the last atom, then  it takes away from the book and it becomes lackluster. This was almost like  reading a Stephen King novel, except the monster was not in the book, but  in READING the book. Not my cup of tea.	2000-07-20

EASIER TO KILL, was another feather in the cap for Ms. Wesley.  Mandy Magic, the subject of the stories, had more secrets than Samsonite had luggage.  How she thought that none would show the light of day proved what  a egotistical subject she would be.  When her veneer did finally crack, it  was Tamara to the rescue!  I enjoyed every bit of the book, and have even  started to pick out who is the killer was.  However, all my choices were  killed instead, and the true killer was someone I almost forgot was in the  story!  I'm now ready for THE DEVIL RIDING.  Keep up the good work.	2000-07-12

There was not  enough tension between the women who conceived these children and the man  who help create them and then left them. At the end of the novel,  everything seemed to be placed in a tight tiny package and 'the end'.  That's it. No more. The emotional level could have been explored a little  deeper. All in all, a quaint read.	2000-07-07

I have read the first three Tamara Hayle novels, and this one was no exception. NO HIDING PLACE, while slightly confusing, still retains the mystery and sharp humor that follows each book. Tamara Hayle and Easy  Rawlings (a Walter Moseley creation) are my favorite dectectives and I  can't wait to finish EASIER TO KILL, so that I will be ready to grab her  brand new offering, THE DEVIL RIDING. By throwing the lifestyles of a  hoodlum and combining them with Tamara's ties with her dead brother, out  came a story that was complex, sad, and hopeful for a brighter tomorrow for  the remaining cast of characters.	2000-06-25

DEVIL'S GONNA GET HIM is the 2nd book in the Tamara Hayle series that has confirmed it's place in my favorite detective series (first is Walter Mosley's Easy Rawlings). She is still as smart and capable as she was in  her first book, WHEN DEATH COMES STEALING. A obnoxious society patron who  pays a visit to Ms. Hayle's office to check on his daughter's new boyfriend  starts the ball rolling, and the patron's murder kicks it into high gear. I  have all of the mysteries, and, if lucky, will have any future novels  involving the new Christy Love of the millenium.	2000-06-12

THE GOOD NEGRESS would have gotten a higher rating from me if it didn't shift so much in time frames. First she's in the country, then she's in the city, then she thinks about the time that something happened in the country  that was relevent to the present, and the story takes us back there, then  stays. Then, we are back in the present, without so much as an  acknowledgment of the transition. WHEW!  Still, this coming of age story  was pretty good. It felt like more of a filler during my downtime, but had  enough to keep me interested.	2000-06-12

Daughter Sterling fighting for the love of her  drug-dealing boyfriend and her addiction to the trash he sells! Daughter  Mink, wanting more from her marriage than her husband can give, attracted  to another man who could give her that, but can't, because he's married!

A young lady who already has everything and lose it all by letting her selfish wants overide her need to have a soul.  The fact that her wealth is contributed to her father's illegal activitites  and she considers it a blessing as she happily spends her fathers money  without realizing his destructive nature made the book even more appealing.  I've never read anything like it before and I truly hope that Sister  Souljah creates a sequel to Winter's story. Maybe with a early parole for  good behavior, Winter story can begin again, this time, with her sister,  who seems to be following in the same footsteps. THINK ABOUT IT, S.S.!	2000-06-12
