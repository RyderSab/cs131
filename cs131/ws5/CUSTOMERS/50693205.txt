This book of her was very good. In the beginning Mary Anne has a regular BSC meeting with her friends, but because of something Kristy did... there comes a HUGE fight between the members of The Baby-Sitters Club. In fact the whole book  is about it, but here is too about Mary Anne and her father. Mary Anne's  mother died when she was a baby and her father is trying to prove that he  can raise a great child without mother. But Mary Anne has to keep her hair  in pigtails and her father buys her clothes. And what about Mary Anne's  room... I learnt a lot from this book and I think you should read this.	2000-08-01

But when I read this second time I loved this book. That's why you have to read it twice too!<br />Only thing I don't like in this book is the fight baby-sitters are having... and Stacey! I hate Stacey in this book. She is all the time like  &quot;This is so embarrasing... This is so embarrasing... I wish I could be  dead... Please, stop!&quot; Why doesn't she understand that her friends are  excited by the city like New York. And I though that it was funny when Mary  Anne was almost arrested.

I finished reading a couple of hours ago and I  must say that it still has a hold on me. Because in other reviews is about  the spot, I'm just going to say my opinions (truthfully) of this book!  <br />This was very good book, I must say. It was far different from the  others and I must say that I couldn't put it down. But this wasn't so  creepy after all. And this is hundreth book of Sweet Valley High series. So  I think that this should've been scarier and I must say that I expected  more from this. But this was still a book you should read! I didn't want to  feed you any lies so that's why here was quite negative text. <br />I'll rate  this with 4 stars!	2000-03-16

I love the main character, Alexandra Rollins. She have started to get chilling phone calls from maniac, who threats that he is going to commit a murder. And he  will... This book was terrofying in some parts. It was very scary and in  one part (believe me or not) I jumped in the air, because I got scared so  much. This is interesting too and it has got horror throught the scary  phone calls, love through Alexandra's new admirer (my fave character in  this book) and drama through the fights between Alexandra and her boyfriend  Noah (I hate him). <br />I'll rate this with 5 big, fat stars!	2000-03-03

Sometimes I could kiss the cover, because this is so great. This is the first SVU-book I've read and I instantly became a big fan of the series. I must say that this is quite unrealistic book and it is  thrilling only in two parts. But hey, this is good! This is worth for money  and I think that you should buy this from Amazon! If you don't believe in  me, then borrow it and read it and buy it after that!<br />I'll rate this with  4 stars.

I mean that it's okay, but it wasn't so good that I would buy it or something. Jessica was in trouble and Liz was acting Jess. There was happy ending, but they should've write longer book. If they've made other plot too, this  could've been better. Borrow it, don't buy it!<br />I'll rate this with 3  stars! I love the next book of this series - Dangerous Love!	2000-03-01

They've started to get weird phone calls when they're baby-sitting. They don't know what to do. The scary adventures at stormy nights, when lights are out... And phone keeps ringing... and ringing...  and ringing...<br />This book was scarier than Stephen King's books! To make  it scarier, read it at night! Or, well. Maybe you shouldn't, because you  can't sleep after that.<br />&quot;Cheeann&quot; was wrong with her review.  Because this is made in 1986 and there wasn't many Caller ID's those days.  So, this book is realistic!<br />I'll rate this with 5 stars!	2000-02-18

And she feels even more strange when she founds out  who Quarter really is!<br />This book was perfect. I love surfing on net and  it was nice to read about it. This is very romantic book and I couldn't put  it down. Plot is great! Here was also the other plot, that made Liz and  Todd fight badly. Liz's opinion of that thing was stupid and I agreed with  Todd... and with Jess too, because she had same opinion. <br />When I rate  this, you may be surprised because I don't give this 5 stars. When I really  think, I give this 4 stars. This book missed something. Should I call it  excitement? In here Finland is wonderful book &quot;Bittitiikeri&quot; (Bit  Tiger) and it has got quite much same kind of plot. But it has more  excitement, reality, action and romance in it. I still think that you  should read this book.	2000-02-07
