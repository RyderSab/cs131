This book isn't as exciting as &quot;Tain&quot; by Gregory Frost, but that is because  this is a translation instead of a retelling. This book is how the Cattle  Raid of Cooley was probably told by the bards 2000 years ago.<br />Essential  for anyone trying to understand the ancient Celts and as good a story as  anything the Greek/Romans/Norse had. Interesting insights into the minds of  the Celts and a darn exciting tale!	2000-07-24

Well written, informative and not as dry as some others of this type, &quot;The Celts&quot; is a scholarly work with none of the romanticism that is found  in so many recent books about the Celts.<br />If you are trying to understand  what the Celts were really like, how they lived and what the world was like  during their time, this is an excellent book to start with. <br />If you are  interested in the modern interpretations of the ancient Celtic religions,  this book will give you some of the factual background that is lacking in  many writings.	2000-07-24

I was born after Pogo stopped running, apparently, but this has to be one of the best comic strips I've ever seen. Kelly has an attention to detail that puts &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; to shame. Granted, comic strips in  those days were bigger than now.<br />On one hand, I liked seeing the  difference between the syndicated strip and the originals, I also felt like  I got ripped off a little since 1/3rd of the book was repeated. The intro  was enough to make up for it. For those of us that didn't know much about  Kelly and his times it was nice to have some additional  information.<br />Great book, I love Pogo!	2000-07-24

The political commentary never distracts from the fact that  comic strips are supposed to be funny. It's hard to explain all the things  that go on in ONE strip. Characters in the background are as much fun as  the main story. So many good things to say about Pogo!	2000-07-24

My biggest problem with this book was getting past the first couple chapters (the book starts near the end of the story), once I actually got rolling with this I  loved it.<br />There are some rather obscure references, but I feel you can  understand the book even if you only partially understand the history. It  certainly helps if you know who the Templars were/are, if you've heard of  the Illuminati, are acquainted with Freemasons, etc. If you aren't versed  in any of this you may be bored/confused. Some background books may help  you out. &quot;Born in Blood&quot; or &quot;The Temple and the Lodge&quot;,  perhaps.<br />I recommend this book to all my conspiracy-theory buddies as  this is the master of all conspiracy-theories. Some of the flashbacks  annoyed me and seemed as if they were filler, but they certainly helped to  flesh out the characters so maybe I was just in a hurry to see how it  ended.<br />If you have some time and are at all familiar with the subject, I  heartily recommend this book. I can't imagine it would make good light  reading tho, this one takes some time and attention.	2000-07-24

Pogo just keeps making me laugh, the artwork of Kelly plus the dialects and accents of the characters added to some darn funny material is  priceless. <br />Walt Kelly was amazing! It's a shame we don't have any comic  strips like this anymore. They manage to be political and funny at the same  time, you could ignore the politics and still laugh at the antics.<br />I'm  asking for nothing else for Christmas, just the rest of these books!<br />The  intro could be shorter, I think.	2000-07-24

I didn't feel I was ready to start in on &quot;Thus Spake Zarathustra&quot; so I  picked this gem up. After finishing it, I moved on to some of Nietzsche's  works and was thankful I'd read some background first.<br />This is still a  moderately difficult read for someone that reads a few pithy quotes now and  then and feels more at home in a computer lab, but it is manageable. I'm  sure a true philosopher type would look down his/her nose at this book, but  I found it useful!	2000-07-22

If you are trying to throw together a paper that needs a bunch of quotes, however...<br />I wanted an idea of what I was  getting myself into before I clawed my way thru &quot;Thus Spake  Zarathustra&quot; and this was just the book to get my attention. Some of  my favorite quotes by Nietzsche aren't included, but they really aren't  that important for achieving a basic understanding.<br />If you are really  into philosophy, you probably aren't buying the &quot;90 Minute&quot;  books. If you are doing graduate level work, you'd better not be in the  &quot;90 Minute&quot; books. If you're taking philosophy at a community  college just because you like taking classes, this book may save you a lot  of time.<br />I liked it, I still use it, but I don't rely on it!	2000-07-22

One of only two books handed out by the lodge, I finished it that very night.<br />This book does an excellent job explaining some of those rather obscure symbols that you may  have happened across.

This book covers the KNOWN Templars, from their humble beginnings to their violent demise. Speculation about what they were really doing, sorcery, Holy Grail/Arc of the Covenant, their eventual metamorphosis into the  Freemasons, etc. have been covered in extensive and often far-fetched  detail elsewhere. If you want to explore the myths surrounding the  Templars, you should start with what is known.<br />I KNOW the Templars were  more than this book says and that they didn't cease to exist in 1312, I  know where they went and where they are now, but I will never be able to  prove it. This book is dull, mundane fact. If you don't start with fact,  however, your entire theory crumbles.<br />If you want to jump straight into  &quot;Born in Blood&quot; or &quot;The Temple and the Lodge&quot;, go  ahead. If you want to understand what the heck they are talking about, you  had better know the mundane history of the Templars.<br />This book is by no  means boring, the documented history of this group is extremely exciting.  Glory and humiliation were both theirs. Power beyond imagining, misery  beyond belief, all these were theirs during the 200 or so years of the  Order.<br />Oh, just read it!	2000-07-22

Bob &quot;the Nailer&quot; is not one of those annoyingly perfect good guys that don't really exist. He has his share of problems, which are explained  in the book but not dwelled on for long.<br />There are some pretty good  reviews here that sum up the story pretty well, so I'm going to skip that.  I will say that I normally read only sci-fi/fantasy and had long ago grown  weary of these type of books. But the way Hunter combines the convoluted  plot twists that Ludlum loves so much with the attention to detail that  Clancy is so known for and then adds his own ability to tell a story in an  interesting way really hooked me.<br />You just may find yourself shopping for  a Winchester mdl 70 or a Remington 700 (in .308, of course) before the end  of this one!<br />&quot;One shot, one kill&quot;	2000-07-21

Skunk Works has built the most advanced planes ever, in total secrecy. <br />From the U-2 thru the SR-71 and the F-117 up to the F-22, this book details the trials and tribulations of a small, focused  division of a huge aerospace conglomerate. Fascinating insight into the  shooting down of Gary Powers over the USSR, frank discussion of decision  making in the U.S. Military, not-so-subtle snipes at the traditionalists in  the U.S. Navy, behind the scenes wrangling, and the low down on the F-117  Stealth fighter. <br />I got this book as a gift when Lockheed and Martin  merged, it's a shame that the entire company can't be as effective as this  one small division.	2000-07-21

Not fantasy- I actually expected this book to be the start of a new path for the author. Eddings style leaves you feeling that  you actually know the characters and I feel I could identify the building  Raphe lived in if I ever was in Spokane. Little, unimportant details are  left scattered about and really bring the story to life without slowing it  down.

I AM a compulsive reader, however, so I keep reading these books even tho I was deeply un-impressed with the second one. This one, however, is the best of the  lot! I haven't read book 4 yet, BTW.<br />Without giving anything away, if  you've really understood the first 2 books, you kind of know what is going  to happen in this one. It's just a matter of waiting to find out HOW it  happens. I was semi-impressed at the lengths they had to go thru to make it  all fit together. Simple stories bore me, and this plot was anything but  simple.<br />Some of the same complaints are still there, however. This series  is obviously targeted at a market 20 or so years younger than me, it'll  never stand up with some of the &quot;classics&quot; of fantasy, but it's  still occasionally fun.<br />I still recommend reading them for yourself. Some  people may not like this, some people will be surprised to discover that  they enjoy these novels!	2000-07-21

This book is great! It covers everything from the full grown size of South American rays  to care of a ray and care of yourself if you get stung by your ray.<br />This  book also helps dispel the myth that all rays are hard to care for. With  clear, concise instructions on what a ray needs to thrive, this book should  be the second that any ray enthusiast buys (&quot;Freshwater Stingrays :  Everything About Purchase, Care, Feeding, and Aquarium Design&quot; by Ross  is the first).<br />Buy these books BEFORE you buy a ray, if possible.

If you don't like fantasy, this book is for you! I've seen it ensnare several people that don't like to read and/or don't like the genre. My mother reads James Michner, my wife reads Fabio, both LOVED this book (and  all the rest).<br />Any book that gets kids reading is a good book, IMHO, and  these are getting kids reading. As an adult that has read some of the  better fantasy books around, I find Harry Potter to be pretty light in most  areas. But, I remind myself, this is supposed to be a childrens  book.<br />I've been a supporter of this series since I first heard the  goofballs crying that these books encouraged witchcraft (I'm a practicing  Druid with a Wiccan background) but I hadn't read them until now.<br />I  appreciate witches and wizards getting a good rap for a change, but they  celebrate Christmas at the school (Hogwarts? something like that) and I  have yet to see any hint of paganism in the books, so the fundamentalists  are over-reacting again (surprise)<br />Anyway, I'm pretty sure I'll end up  reading them all but I don't think they are going to take the place of  David Eddings, Terry Brooks, Feist, Donaldson, etc. This one is worth  buying so you can see what all the hubbub is about and judge for yourself.	2000-07-14

A wealth of ideas, this  book can be one step on your spiritual path. Or it can be just an  interesting book about modern druids. Regardless of your beliefs, if you  have any interest in the subject this is a good book.<br />There are many  other books available if you are interested in historical druids- &quot;The  Druids&quot; by Stuart Piggott, for example.	2000-07-12

Once again, Philip Carr-Gomm is NOT an anthropologist and hisbooks are NOT about the ancient druids. Druidry is a modern beliefwith only occasional ties to events/beliefs of 2000 years ago, just as modern Christianity is.<br />I finished this book with a feeling of peace, it was almost a meditation to read it. However, I got very little practical information out of it. I certainly don't feel that it is &quot;a complete description of the Druid Way.&quot; The comments by the author are closer to the book than the &quot;synopsis&quot; is. Wonderfully written, this book brings together a stroll around the countryside with the grief of a loss of a friend to show a path to enlightenment through the power and beauty of the earth.<br />...if you want to know about ancient druids, check out &quot;The Druids&quot; by Stuart Piggot or &quot;The Celts&quot; by T. G. E. Powell. The fact of the matter is the historical druids committed very little to paper until after they were assimilated into the Culdee church. And that all had the taint of Christianity on it.	2000-07-12

As a Master Mason I find books such as these to be, more often than not, complete fiction. This one has just enough historical truth in it to keep you reading. I feel that the authors focused on Scotland a bit much, but  there were some interesting data that I was unaware of.<br />Baigent and Leigh  have a bit of a reputation for jazzing up history to make it more  interesting... OK, that was putting it very nicely. I do not believe that  they made up any of the facts, but the conclusions they sometimes draw  could use a little help. I'd recommend this book to anyone that is mildly  interested in either Freemasonry or the Knights Templar. &quot;Born in  Blood&quot; is slightly more scholarly, if you wish to step up a notch. Not  saying either are 100% true, but what is? The &quot;official&quot; history  of Masonry is based partially on speculation also, Baigent and Leigh just  have a more exciting speculation...	2000-07-03

I read it after I became a Master Mason, but before I went through the Scottish Rite. There are a few glaring errors in it, but not enough to invalidate the entire book. The worst thing that can be said  about this book is that it may not be true. Then again, I know the  'official' history of Freemasonry and it also may not be true. As with many  things, gather as much info as possible and then draw your own  conclusions.<br />The fact that we do not know the roots of an order that is,  at least, 400 years old is hardly surprising. &quot;Born in Blood&quot;  raises some good questions, even if the author doesn't have all the  answers.	2000-07-03

After reading  works by Piggot and Herity, this was a major disappointment.<br />It is true  that much that the neo-pagan crowd holds dear cannot be proven, indeed may  be a highly romanticized version of a 18th century book or two, but to  write an entire book with the (apparent) sole intention of insulting them  seems a trifle excessive.<br />Discounting any similarity between tombs  because they are not identical is petty nit-picking. Dating a possibly  pre-christian work by its first mention by a Christian scholar is silly.  The author seems more intent on saying &quot;we don't really know&quot;  than in bringing forth actual information (actually, in my opinion, the  author seemed more intent on saying &quot;everything everyone else said is  wrong, but I'M right&quot;)<br />We DON'T actually know a lot of this stuff,  but I can say that in a paragraph and I won't charge you for it!	2000-02-08

I have actually read this book, and I recommend you keep it handy to debate door-to-door evangelists. I now invite them into my home and sit down and talk with them. Using McKinsey's book, I have yet to lose an  argument about the bible. I am amazed at how many people are able to shrug  off the problems and fall back on &quot;God said it, I believe it, that  settles it&quot; in spite of the fact that McKinsey rarely (if ever) goes  outside the bible to prove it false. As he says in the EBE &quot;...the  Bible is its own worst enemy.&quot; One need only to read Genesis with an  open mind to see this. It seems some people are able to take one weak  argument from McKinsey's book and claim it invalidates the entire book, yet  the bible has hundreds of mistakes in it that somehow are irrelevent. The  EBE has mistakes in it, but Mr. McKinsey doesn't claim to be infallible, he  leaves those claims to the fundementalists.	1999-12-01
