This is one of the very few books I have truly wished I could return and get my money back.  I love historical mysteries - but I didn't care what happened in this one because the characters were so uninteresting.	2003-12-10

How can we truly believe that Thea would be allowed to go \\"undercover\\", find out so much so fast, and then return to \\"work\\" after her medical problem - just to name a few of the most ridiculous plot points?	2003-12-06

But never say never (when your stuck in an airport desperate for reading material the definition of never changes a bit).<br />The cat is still annoying, but this book was a great improvement over the first and the second (which I went back and read hoping it would be as interesting as third - it wasn't)	2002-10-27

Charlotte and Gracie (a delightful character I wish we saw more of) are sent on holiday only to be \\"rescued\\".  The use of the Inner Circle as a plot device (again) is not particularly original.  The novel leaves you lacking a sense of closure.  Good enough read, but not the best of the series.	2002-07-01

Sky Knife's story line was a little too dependent on magic and a little light on practicality for my taste.

This is 12th in the series and the author must be ready to \\"get rid\\" of the characters and it shows.  The plot is rushed and contrived and the characters were stereotypes one and all.  Perhaps if I had been following the series through several books I would have felt differently.  Recommend not purchasing, instead borrow from library.	2002-04-16

Such detail would be of much more interest to a fellow circus history aficionado than someone(like me) with a passing interest.  <br />Well researched, even handed account of the subject matter.	2002-04-08

It was if the author felt she had to use every bit of historical background she had found - little of which served to move the book forward.  I did not feel I got to know Mae West nearly as well as I did the times she was living in - which was not what I wanted from a Mae West biography.	2002-04-04

Is everyone in the small village insane?<br />The writing is solid and I enjoy the historical perspective and would read more in the series - but come up with new reasons for the murderers to kill - good old fashioned greed would be fine for a change.	2001-11-23
