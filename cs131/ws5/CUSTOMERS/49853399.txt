Very mad; I miss the book, but it's so expensive.  It's amazing the way the author incorporates all sorts of literary allusions in this physics book, such as offering an interesting hypothesis on the optical illusion of the egyptians getting swallowed by the red sea while chasing the jews.

One of my favorite parts is his criticism (following his explanation) of deconstructionism.  &quot;It allows you to drive a coach and horses through everybody else's beliefs while not saddling you with the inconvenience of having to adopt any yourself.  It is, in effect, an invulnerable position, and the fact that it is also purely empty is simply the price one has to pay for this.&quot;  This mild sarcastic humor is great, it is his instructive method.  On structuralism, he talks about how the fact that it goes AGAINST common sense is one of its strong points, as he slyly decapitates common sense: &quot;The world is pretty much as we perceive it, and our way of perceiving it is the natural, self-evident one.  We know he sun goes round the earth because we can see that it does...&quot;  <BR>     It progressively gets more and more 'marxist' but never really explains marxist literary theory, kind of egging you on to buy his other books in a way.  A good bibliography, too.	2002-08-20

Though they are beautiful, many of the photos make some of the asanas look more difficult than they are; some of them ARE that difficult, and you can't tell what's feasible for your level and what's not.  The sets and ordering at the appendix are good.  Some of the Vishnu-deavananda and Sivananda theories on yoga are very uncompromising, and individuals really must wonder and think when they read these.  What IS the physical and/or mental, spiritual benefit of sexual abstinence for example?  Many people just ignore this.  What about vegetarianism?  Are the yogic theories the same as the new western ones?  Do they lead to one another, is there a logical link? Religion and biology are so mixed up together, and westerners just become pseudo-hindus sometimes, and end up looking stupid and becoming useless people.  The Sivananda program demands questioning, and does not always provide answers.  What does chanting a few oms do?  Do you need to know what you're saying when you chant a mantra to benefit from it?  One of the things I like about Bikram Choudhoury's approach is that he nixes all this [poor] spiritualism not because he doesn't find it true and/or useful, but because he doesn't think one should just go through the motions without understanding what they're doing, and so he focuses on and explains the physical benefits of the asanas with some expectation that their performance will lead a yogi into different habits and a different life.  I don't know which way is better.  Anyway, the book is good.  It's not my favorite	2002-08-20

It opens itself up to so much, talking about his theories of influence, precursing everything from queer theory and gender transitivity to Harold Bloom, and it is a poem, too. It's beautiful.  It offers his thoughts on the most diverse materials, gets into the most detail on his Hindu readings, gets very brave in \\"Swedenborg.\\" But ... for a 165-page book?  Delbanco's intro is boring and useless. Don't even READ it before you read the book.  It'll be like watching an educational video on yeast infections before watching a porno.  The index is a kind of neat feature; it's cool to see how many men are mentioned how many times.  For example, the most obvious 'omission' in the book, JESUS, is mentioned only 5 times in the book, but he lurks throughout in so many ways.  I love the book, but think the edition is a huge ripoff.  However, it is difficult to find all these essays in one volume without buying a \\"complete works\\" or something, and they are ALL good and work together as a complete 'book,' one essay building off the prior in subject and time, going from B.C. to the nineteenth century, from Plato to Napoleon and Goethe.	2002-08-20

The book is powerful, it is very lonely and sad being God, and very lonely and sad being man, too.  The language is repetitive and simple, like scripture.  The character of Jesus is unique here, the author takes some chances, has... I wouldn't say fun.  But plays.  And does so in a loving way, with effort, sometimes more inspired than other times.  And he questions the whole scribal process of Matthew, too, with the archangel making him write things that he does not witness, like the virgin birth in Bethlehem and the adoration of the magi which just fulfill prophecies.  God's truth and man's are not the same. gasp.<BR>     The actual \\"last temptation\\" stuff where Jesus goes and starts the family with martha and mary I found very weak, almost disappointed the entire book, very flashy and gawdy and overwritten and false, not false because it didn't happen or doesn't correspond with scriptures but false in the writing, false in spirit.<BR>     Some parts bring tears to my eyes.  Judas is deep.  His character emerges so strongly.  Chapter 12, the making of wine followed by the persecution of Mary Mag and Jesus saving her, is one of the best chapters I have read in any book anywhere.<BR>    Some emergences of 'biblical characters' are weak, such as Saul/Paul, and I think more could have been done with Pilate.  I liked the portrayal of Peter, my favorite saint, his weakness, his fleshiness, his sometime joy, his earnestness, his effort, his failure.  He reminds me of a painting by Carravagio of the three denials of St. Peter, this old man pathetic really, denying he knows the man.<BR>    And jesus is fierce.  And there is the transformation that the desert has on him, from lover to lion.  This is true imagination, this is what imaginations are made for.	2002-07-10

This has the spanish poems side by side with english translations, many of which I don't really like because they do things like switch words and lines and take a little too much freedom and change the spirit of the poem, but that's okay.  You can read the spanish, read the english, and see exactly what has been changed, but the beauty is in the spanish ones, and though his vocabulary is large, yours doesn't really have to be to appreciate the sound and sight of these poems in spanish. I love many of the sonnets, plus the king of harlem, which reminds me of HCE from Finnegans Wake, this character that becomes the landscape itself, &quot;after walking&quot;, and many others from the poet in new york.  I've just been getting into some spanish poets after reading some st john of the cross and seeing what types of flows and life can be infused into words in this language, and these dark, bloody grimy oozes of language have had me high for weeks.	2002-03-10

I still prefer Joseph Campbell's Skeleton Key to FW, though it admits that it does not try to catch every allusion.  I find that most of the things that I really do want to find out, where I hear some echo of something, he doesn't touch on, or doesn't touch on to my satisfaction.  Really, this project should be a collaboration online where people would add their comments to the possible meanings of different lines, because there are so many.  Each man comes at it with his own knowledge, interests and needs, and can't get everything.  So while this is useful for some, it's more of an impediment for me.

This is at least one thesis of the book which is proven.  Gopi Krishna was a middle class clerk who practiced meditation and began to experience an awakening of the kundalini, an energy source at the base of the spine which he admits he cannot fully explain.  He does not try to theorize into divine origin of this power, but rather puts forth his experience, which is often harrowing, insatiable appetitites, the feeling of buring up, inability to sleep, and he hopes that medical science will continue to study this phenomenon, so that the ancient ideas can be elucidated by modern science.  It is also an autobiography.  Krishna's father basically became a sort of attic-hermit, a sannyasin that didn't quite leave the house, but became somewhat of a burden on the family, and led them to poverty.  Gopi Krishna does not judge, but the reader wonders about those effects on the author.<br />  What I like best about this book is its realism in dealing with a topic which westerners especially have turned into a mushy neo-hippy thing for those who have lost their sex drive.  There is no practical advice for the awakening of Kundalini, as Krishna asserts it must be at least somewhat random, it can happen by accident, and one might meditate and practice yoga for years and years and never achieve it.  There is some discussion of the saving of semen which will go through the spine to the brain, and some discussion of the traditional powers ascribed to an awakened kundalini, but very based, and trying to be very honest. Very sober.	2001-12-27

A true handbook for yoga, if ever there was one. This was one of the first yoga books I ever looked at, and it initially helped me see the point and begin to embark on the discipline.  It is more useful to those who have already begun to practice yoga, as its immensity will leave some without a clue as to where to begin, how much to do, etc.  Bikram's Sequence is a good start, but should never be the be all-end all.	2001-12-27

Study them, in fact.  The notes in this version are very good, and the extra illustrations are great, particularly the painting of Adam and Eve discovering Abel with Cain running off covering his newly marked forehead.

This is a beautiful sequence, it can literally change your life, change the structure of your body, and that's why the heat is necessary, and it is NOT that hard.  A few poses are, but the point is you do them to the best of your ability properly and you are benefitting.  You will find that they have you holding each pose for only ten counts or so, whereas you should really hold them for closer to a minute or so (and thats how you would hold them in a class).  <BR>   BUT... this is NOT the be all end all. It is important to change your yoga sometimes, and you should not be afraid to try different things, even play with the bikram sequence a little, though he says not to.<BR>   Overall, it does work better if you take some classes, but if those are too expensive, this is just fine.

This is a wonderful introduction to St. John of the Cross for a Hindu. <BR>   His scholarship on St. John and the exposition of his work is great, I never realized what creative, imaginitive discourse was available in the Catholic Canon.  <BR>   My thought is that St. John of the cross is like Arjuna, except he's telling his own story.  Theres a sensual longing, and indentity with the senses and material reality in the Bhagavad Gita, especially in the context of the Mahabharata, the story of a civil war.  Same goes for St. John of the Cross, he finds God in the darkness after escaping jail, and the description encompasses deep religious hope in an almost homo-erotic vision.  <BR>   St. John's &quot;darkness&quot; is different from the Hindu emptiness in its tone, the differences outweigh the similarities.  Myadil does not try to historically connect the two, though he summarizes the scholarship that does.<BR>  The author betrays his Christian bent only minimally and without any self-consciuos deception.  I think its a beautiful book, simply written. <BR>   But it leaves something to be desired, I guess, as all religious literature can do sometimes, when it is good. Most importantly, Myladil sees this short study as a beginning, of a conversation between Christians and Hindus to develop mutual respect and appreciation.  A great book, also, for those who might be very down on the Catholic Church.  I am convinced the Church can rid itself of corruption and be a positive non-repressive model for the world one day.	2001-11-17

The introduction and footnotes are among the most complete available anywhere with good references to hebrew, classical, and other motifs within the poem.  It addresses the ptolemic vs. copernican debate (sun round earth or earth round sun) and Milton's astronomy in some depth in the introduction, maybe beyond what will be interesting until you've finished the poem.  <br>    A timeless edition, I would say, which is why its still popular after 40 years, much better than the penguin classic edition.	2001-11-13

The introduction points out that unlike in the bible or other texts where multiple copies existed to compare and then put down a good translation, this one damaged group of codecies and scrolls were the only thing available, and so there are alot of gaps in the translations.  When Elaine Pagels (one of the translators) wrote her book &quot;The Gnostic Gospels,&quot; she quotes from this Nag Hammadi library, but her quotes are more fluent.  There are so many (...'s) in this that it is difficult to extract any meaning from lots of the texts.  In some ways, this is understandable, because it is important for editors and translators not to try to add to the scripture, but some more notation and some possibilities for words would have been nice.<BR>    The gospel of philip, the gospel of thomas, the steles of seth, the gospel of wisdom, among others, are good to read.  Sometimes, after reading this, you see how different John was from the other three gospels in the new testament, it was almost gnostic. I also, after reading some of St. John of the Cross recently, wonder whether gnosticism survived for longer than many people think among different Christian and Catholic communities in Europe and Africa.	2001-11-13

Not disbelief, but doubt.  That is (among other things) the premise of this book, in some ways, and it is from this question that much of the &quot;blasphemy&quot; charges come from.  The main thing I liked about this book more than any other Rushdie books was his ability to keep his humour from getting too goofy, as he does in all his books, including Midnight's Children.  There is something incredibly odd and eerie and visually comprehendable about Chamcha sitting in the attick of the indian restaurant, stinking, with goat's legs and horns, and it still doesn't just turn me away the way club-handed, fast aging Moor, or even big nose from Midnight did.  The scenes in the dessert, and the way Gibreel imagines himself as the archangel without any answers are great.  Rushdie weaves the mythical into the real world with the best of ability and seamlessness in this book.  Gibreel is among the greatest characters in all english literature, I would not hesitate to say.  Up there with Leopold Bloom and anyone else you might want to think of.  He works his way through reality and hallucination and dream and real placement in mythical/real times, plus of course, he is a movie actor that acts like gods.  Yet through all his trials, he is very real, and his beginnings are very real.  I love this character. He keeps a steadiness forever throughout the book, though he swings from &quot;good&quot; to &quot;evil&quot; sometimes.  This is my favorite Rushdie book.	2001-07-06

Richard Wright's introductory essay &quot;How Bigger Was Born&quot; is an excellent essay, and prompted me to read the book.  I did see where Wright was unsuccessful in some places, particularly towards the end of the novel, when the two attorneys are speaking.  We lose the sense of Bigger's perspective, and get Wright's and others' perspectives, which Wright says he did not want to do.  The strongest parts of the book are in the beginning and through his escape and plotting. Reading this book, say on the train for a half hour, you get off and look around you with a nasty scowl.  It's impossible not to.  You can truly understand the character, and how he would react to most situations.  Wright goes ahead and gives him the most trying circumstances around.  Bigger is a compelling character, and this is a great story.  Bigger's hopes and dreams, his nasty worldiness, and his frightening distorted realization of his purpose and his self at the end are slowly growing entities of their own, which leave an undelible mark on the reader forever.  I don't expect to ever forget much of this book.  One of the things I liked in the essay was how Wright said, after the response to his short stories, that he would never write something that would be so easy as to bring tears.  Your approach to this is much more difficult. It's not a tear-jerker.  An excellent read, the book is written in plain good prose, too.  Bigger is a truly unique character in literature of any sort.	2000-12-01

Shahid is not as interesting as the hero in Buddha (forget his name) was.  He's not as smart, doesn't have as much gusto to know and love and live in the world, he's not as daring, but he's good.  Furthermore the supporting characters, unlike the father and the rock star from Buddha, are all caracatures, some of which intially show promise, like his neighbor, the leader of a fanatical Muslim group, who originally shows an understanding passionate ear to Shahid, but then all but disappears or becomes a complete mockery.  He could have been better.  If Shahid was looking for brotherhood and found something attractive in the group, it is never explored.  He never seems to care, not care, agree, or disagree, and I don't know whether this was Kureishi's point, or if the book was just poorly written.  His lover lacks depth, as does his brother.  The drugdealer proves to be boring and not worth reading, and then finally, his family history, his place, is never explored.  Nothing is resolved, its a sitcom-type of comedy, but it is often a fun read.  The raves and the chases and the experiences are all quite easy and fun to read, but the story never takes off like Buddha. I guess it stays closer to home, its a little more realistic, but overall, the book is much weaker than Buddha of Suburbia.	2000-12-01

That is the essence of Teddy.  Salinger writes brilliant children brilliantly, and in these stories, he can be much more brazen with the actions and words of characters than in a novel. I would like to read Catcher in The Rye, as I know, from rumour that it also involves a love of children.  I'm also curious about that new book his daughter wrote.  But its not just about children, meaning young humans.  For Eloise, the death of her first love (incidentally Buddy Glass's brother Walter, I believe), makes her &quot;grow up&quot; into a life of curtained misery. Her daughter's prescense and relation to the imaginary friend is a device that JDS uses to show how Eloise has inevitably and miserably matured.  The child Lionel, in &quot;Down at the Dinghy,&quot; is also written well, though this story seems simpler.  The narrator of deDaumier-Smith's Blue Period realizes how he is seen, he is a somewhat frightening man. He is no longer a boy, though he lies and acts like one and longs for his dead mother.  Death's appearance in these stories is important and related to the children notions, and they're brought together in Teddy.  But basically, the end of childhood, whether we're talking pure bachelorhood (Laughing Man), the naivete of an affair, the realization of circumstances, brings a longing for death.  Logical knowledge, as we know it, is a trap, and when characters see the design of the trap, (and readers too), a quite divine sadness can come about.  Salinger, in Franny and Zooey, this book, and Seymour and others, often talks of the Vedanta tradition, and of Ramakrishna.  Vedanta, which allows for one truth, which men call by different names, lets people explore religions fully. If you learn about it, you can much more fully understand and appreciate Salinger's religion in his books.  Only Teddy mentions it in his book.  But you can read about Ramakrishna in &quot;The Gospel of SriRamakrishna&quot; translated by Swami Nikhilananda, a dense and specific book about one man, but a major influence on JDS.<br />  Furthermore, my favorite stories in this volume are Bananafish, The Laughing Man, For Esme with Love and Squalour, Teddy. Pretty Mouth and Green Eyes is the weakest, but it's not bad.  Salinger does show he's up to the task to write modern short stories.and and appreciate Salinger's religion in his books.

The  experience which wakes his sleeping soul, allows him to return to the west  a new man with new ambitions.  In the meantime, the book can be quite  silly, but Henderson is an interesting character, something like a Gulliver  or Oddysseus (more like Leopold Bloom, though). He's adventurous to a  strong pain. Bellow is a great writer at times his prose just turns the  most silly situations into interesting points of reflection.  I like the  way the book is not about symbolism or metaphor unless it is overt and  almost mocking.  Occasionally the book gets tedious. Although I liked the  book, I don't know where it got it's classic status.  It doesn't seem to be  anything groundbreaking, just a humourous, well-written novel.	2000-08-03

The book offers insight into the life and thoughts of Naipaul and shows us a more personable side of the author, who seems to be on such a solo mission.  Furthermore, we learn of his relationship to his father and the  background of Naipaul's greatest character, Mohun Biswas.  Naipaul's father  was a true writer, a literature buff, unlike Biswas, who liked Marcus  Aurelius and kept info in a Shakespeare that he may or may not have ever  read. In letters, we don't see much of the temper or the actions of the  character Biswas, but we see the meditations of the man who was his source.  We also see VS Naipaul's transformation from West Indian student leaving  the island for the first time, to a published author four years later.  We  read that &quot;useless letter&quot; that Naipaul describes in A House for  Mr. Biswas, sent home following Biswas' death, and we learn all about the  sympathy and respect that Naipaul had when writing this character.  From  this time on, he knew he would be a writer.  He has longings and inklings  towards India and Africa, he is already an anglophile with a strong  rejection of coloured people, and an inclination to disassociate himself  with these people, whom he finds ignorant and barbaric, a common criticism  of his literature. There seems to show, in the uncommented upon letters,  some of Naipaul's faults and prejudices and feelings of shortcomings, as a  West Indian in England, as an outsider, always.  But he never rejected his  family, and was in fact a very sincere and loving brother and son.  This is  somewhat surprising considering the coldness that he sometimes can exude.  His discussions of loneliness, of brotherhood and the need to take care of  each other seem like preludes to stories from &quot;In a Free State.&quot;   Naipaul describes his life as an extention of his father's, fulfilled.  And  his father was already talking about writing an autobiography in the third  person.  Naipaul may have fulfilled this in Biswas, a fictional account.   There is a hopefulness in Naipaul's letters that may not be as apparent in  some of his later works, there is also the dark depression and dim view of  the world and its inhabitants that is seen.  His social attitudes and the  way he writes about them shed more insight into his characters' social  interactions as well.  &quot;The women I have known I have met quite by  chance.  Acquaintanceship is struck up almost unconsciously.&quot;  This is  similar to relationships that develop in Bend in the River and other books.   Mostly, this is the development of the ideas of writing, the motivations,  financial (primarily), emotionally.  Both Naipauls saw writing as a  profession, not a spiritual letting out of feelings or something, they  approached writing professionally and with dignity, even in their letters,  which they do critique.  This book is a primary source of insight into the  life and mind of one of the greatest writers of our time. I recommend it to  any Naipaul enthusiast. Naipaul's literary career seems to have been  well-plotted and worked out before it even began.	2000-06-07

There were touching scenes with the young couple talking about their lost son, and the Third and Final Continent was exceptional, in its sympathy.  Much of the rest of  the book I found a bit repulsing because it seemed like she was pulling  things out, describing Boston in a way I found misinformed and dishonest,  knowing she could get away with things.  She can put together a story,  incorporate elements into it that are common in NewYorker type stuff,  nothing too difficult, nothing nearly honest enough.  Not to say that it  isn't good reading and that the stories are fluffy, they are not.  They are  well written, they just leave something to be desired, and I feel a bit  like something false is thrown at me.	2000-04-28

The charcters are well drawn out, more complex than the simple &quot;good&quot; people  that I kind of tired of in the novel.  Certain images, like unwrapping and  cracking a cricket bat, parading a thief, cursing out people at the bus,  are written descriptively with Mistry's characteristic humour and sympathy.   The last story about Canada is also great, and the real &quot;tales&quot;  like Squatter are also funny.  The Collectors may have been my favorite  story, and there is interesting intensely sexually frustrating imagery  which is very sublime and hidden in these stories of adolescents in the  complex.  Sometimes its out in the open.  Overall, Mistry is a very realist  writer and does best when he stays away from being judgemental, when he  creates characters that I imagine are from his life, not from his research.   I enjoyed this book thoroughly.	2000-04-28

This book is a great read, it is powerful, every chapter starts with a relevant quote, usually by a Socialist leader.  It is filled with the incidents of huey's life and his beliefs.  It is clearly written and shows  the strong convictions of the man in affirming personal freedom and  justice, and his belief that it can be done.  Through all the trials and  tribulations he went through, and through the rhetoric that went back and  forth between the panthers and government, Huey manages to steer away from  cliches, (though he interestingly describes the way they came up with the  word &quot;pig&quot; for cops.) I was fortunate enough to pick this book up  in middle school after hearing about huey newton on a rap album, and being  curious.  I don't understand why it is so hard to find. I have found  Eldridge Cleaver's Soul on Ice recently, and find it amazingly honest in a  way that huey doesn't get, with his personal life and weaknesses.  And  Bobby Seale, the other founder, has written some books as well. Its  unproductive to talk about which is better.  This one is great.	2000-04-13

The Rape of The Holy Mother is like a  manifesto for the new poet.

While I read through this long book pretty quickly because it is clearly written, and it is good in terms of letting you visualize the scenes and characters, I found it to be too preachy and steinbecky.  Some bad things  happen, then some more bad things happen, then some bad people do bad  things to good people, followed by worse things, horrible violent things,  and a horrible thing.  In between, some minor bad things happen, but there  is a bit of humour here and there, plus some touching moments and the boy  and the woman and the two tailors develop a friendship that seems a little  too cartoony for me. There are interesting quirks throughout, I found  Beggarmaster to be one of the best characters in the novel, and the  landowners in the tailors' villiage to be the most one-dimensional.  Mistry  overwrote this book.  When I see his collection of short stories from  Firozha Baag, I realize that he is capable of creating much better pieces  than this almost propaganda-like tradgedy.  I give it 4 stars because of  its ability to read and its genuine sympathy for human suffering. But  that's generous.	2000-04-10

I was hooked straight from the beginning when I saw the detatched way that he was going to try and write about himself in the third  person.  He writes beautifully, and thankfully, he doesn't stay too  detatched, nor is he quite reliable.  He's way too &quot;modest&quot; about  his abilities and education.  But the sadness that comes as he gets older,  the pace changes, and the energy shift, is amazing.  You also see the world  that he lived in, and for someone of his time, the extensive travels and  encounters that he experienced surely cannot have been surpassed.  The book  is a lesson on massachusetts political, religious, and philosophical  thought, as well as a critique of that fromsomeone who explored the rest of  the world.  There are certain parts of the book which relate to local  current politics of the time which may not be of interest to anyone but  real historians.  But overall, this is an excellent read for anyone. It is  a book about human experience and education.	2000-04-10

I did get lost in the lives and the time and the city of the characters.  I cared for them and understood the phacades they felt they had to put on, however,  I often found it too over-emotional.  Baldwin does make you uncomfortable  with his brutal honesty, the horror of exisiting as an outsider always  travels with the reader.  That's good, and I do enjoy the book.  But it  takes away after a while.  The dialogue becomes very rhetorical and forced.   Everything is just layed out, instead of kind of put through with some  drama.  Now I'm not saying you always have to hide your message in some  hemingwayish way in the dialogue, but I find it hard, at times, to believe  that these characters are real people because of the stuff they say.  Overall, I loved the book, though.  It is timeless, yet it paints a picture  of a particular time in NYC that is vivid and brilliant.	2000-04-10

You go through it, and you pick out any part and say, why must he be so wordy about two people getting a guinness, but you realize that he is putting all  the mythical overload into trivial events, and that while it is absurd, it  is true.  If you can read this book in a class, that would be best, but at  least be sure to have a complete guide so that you can get some of the  allusions. You don't need to catch EVERYthing. It is very show-offy, a bit  like Joyce is trying to just pack every single piece of information he's  ever picked up into this novel (or whatever you'd like to call it, I think  it is a novel, though).  This can be annoying, but it is amazing.  And I  think that was his point, to describe his world and everything in it,  through the story of a common man, whose heroism so deeply embedded in him  is overlooked.	2000-04-10

This is the best war book (along with Tim Obriens The Things They Carried which is way different, and about a different war, but equally powerful) that I have  read.  It exhibits everything and gets to the point of life and its lack of  purpose if you cannot find something worth dying for, and that that purpose  is not the real purpose at all when it comes down to dying.  This is not a  dark book, nor is it self-pitying as I imagine a less able writer would  make it so soon.  It is not even depressing, it is exciting and touching  and well-written.

The way Baldwin writes  about music is virtually unparallelled.  In these short stories, he manages  to stay clear of the sometimes excessive sentimentality that comes out in  novels like Another Country.  We sympathize with everyone, we see  everyone's need for love, the intense loneliness of human experience, and  the individual alienation and experience that results from societal  divisions of race and sexuality.   The first two stories contain the same  characters from his famous first novel Go Tell it on The Mountain.  The  biblical imagery in these stories is not always pronounced as it may be in  Go Tell..., but Baldwin's command of the bible show us the fear and the  decadence that it exalts even when the allusions are abstract.  The cup of  trembling, the sight of the father's foot in the first story.      Baldwin  is a writer whom people have expected something out of and have been  disappointed with because he does not fit into the desired mold of the  black writer or the gay writer or even the american writer.  He can be an  objective political essayist or a sentimental dramatist, and here, he  offers cold, somewhat detatched portraits of american lives which are among  the best portraits of these people ever written.   He puts the lives of  marginal americans, from poor white rural southerners, to expatriates, and  black urban displaced men and women, into the dramatic realm that hints of  myth.  His descriptions are riveting, his sexual honesty can be rude,  exposing the reader to the America that exposed him.	1999-09-07
