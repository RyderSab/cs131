I wish Strenger had written a more rigorous book.  His blithe dismissals of Kleinians -- implying that science refutes their theories, without offering evidence -- confuses, especially as two of his heroes, Stephen Mitchell and Nancy Chodorow, have found much to admire in Kleinian ideas.   <br /> <br />Strenger seems to want to dip in and out of different theories, without theorizing the theory that guides him -- or doesn't.  That said, there are a few wonderful case vignettes here, as well as a lucid contrast of Michael Eigen and Adam Phillips.  Still, for the radical project Strenger is undertaking, a much more thorough book is required.  I believe the mildness of the back-cover blurbs reveals that his colleagues feel the same.	2004-12-22

Weak introductory and closing captures don't mar the effectiveness -- despite the usual limitations of dogmatic analytic writing that does not try to communicate to a wider audience -- of an empathic and difficult look at twins.  Lewin exemplifies the best of the Kleinian tradition in that she is able to bear unthinkable anxieties while representing the deepest layers of the inner lives of twins.	2004-11-28

As is often the case, one wishes he went into further detail and resisted psychoanalytic lingo at times.  But one would have to look hard to find a deeper, more humble, more complex psychoanalytic thinker in the world today.  <br /> <br />If Kernberg had the writing ability of, say, the late Stephen A. Mitchell, his works might find a wider audience.  I would like to see a fine writer take up Kernberg's ideas and find a way to communicate them more coherently.  Even those well-versed in psychoanalysis may find themselves wishing for a clearer articulation of how Kernberg gets from A to B.   <br /> <br />That said, this is a rigorous and exciting collection.	2004-11-17

But Symington is convincing and his metaphors, which at first seem ludicrous, gradually acquire genuine power.  One wishes Symington would think through his ideas more thoroughly so as to expose them to critique, but at the same time one must recognize that a good deal of explanatory power would be lost in the process.

Most portraits of the artist as a young man sentimentalize the artist, or hyperbolize in order to titillate, or try to evoke the spirit of the time in which he is coming of age.  Coetzee, as he did similarly (but not identically) in Boyhood, sticks close to his narrator's consciousness.  This makes for a plodding and difficult look at a young man's life.  It feels so close to reality, and in that way very far from literature.  This is not a story in the traditional sense -- it's a hard, precise reflection of a consciousness struggling to emerge.  Its insistence on portraying reality in a form reflective of that reality is this book's finally gorgeous achivement.	2003-11-11

This often brilliant book, hampered by repetitive and awakward prose, shows how the stories we grow up with help us to symbolize and work through our inner conflicts.  I know of no other book like this and I found it evoked childhood feelings of mine -- as well as present problems derived from them -- with great acuity.<br />What the book is lacking in is wit, a sense of proportion, a historical sensibility, and overall design.  Shockingly the book completely unravels when Bettelheim analyzes the most popular fairy tale of all time, Cinderella.  As this tale doesn't fit in as well as others with psychoanalytic theory, one feels him jamming his theories inappropriately into it, not unlike the stepsisters forcing their feet into the glass slipper by hacking off their toes and heels.  Bettelheim doesn't self-destruct that badly, but the reader definitely gets a glimpse at the end into the obstinacy and grandiosity of a brilliant and troubled man.	2003-09-26

However much one thinks that theory no longer applies, at least in those dusty metaphors, her use of it (like Kernberg's) illuminates areas of psychic experience that other psychoanalytic theory can't touch.  Moving, clear-sighted, strange, and loving, McDougall's work is essential reading for anyone with an interest in coming to terms with inexorably perverse modes of interacting with the world.  My only caveat is that case illustrations tend to be unnecessarily rigid and at times withholding in their presentation (though they also seem unfailingly honest).	2003-08-05

Lacking the excesses of the &quot;sophists&quot; as he would call them, the book is a welcome move away from postmodern confusion (itself useful, but perhaps lacking in, or glorifying its lack of, humility).  Unafraid of truth and love, A SMALL TREATISE speaks to us in our own complex and fraught language of the simplest ideas that animate our lives.  The book draws mostly on Spinoza, Freud, Alain, and a smattering of Greeks.

An intrapsychic look at interpersonal relationships, CLINICAL KLEIN is fascinating and apt.  My only caveat is that Hinshelwood takes too many of his examples from dreams of patients, or clinical manifestations, and not enough from the outside lives of the patients.  This creates a protective solipsism that psychoanalysis is often and rightly accused of.  Still, this is rigorous stuff.  It aims to heal by avoiding (and embracing) nothing.	2003-08-01

More mature than self-help, less obscure than psychological theory, this one-day-read is ennobling and charming.  Pipher writes with dignity about her profession's limitations and how an awareness of those limitations opens up vital possibilities.  The format -- brief letters to a therapst-in-training, focused on a specific theme -- is lovely, and the insights, while not revelatory, are deftly articulated.  In fact, that the book's insights are not revelatory is in a way its overall theme, and its pleasure.  This is a humble, humane, and helpful book.	2003-07-29

The New York Times pan of this show somehow did not translate into its failure at the box office, mainly because Greenberg has seen fit to gratuitously disrobe beautiful men for large chunks of the play's interminable running time.<br />The flaws of this play are too numerous to really address in depth.  Suffice to say, Greenberg's gay Upper West Side sensibility doesn't translate to this milieu; his exploration of masculinity and cultural bias lacks all subtlety and verges on the crass: the portrayal of a racist Southerner and a meek Asian are just the most insidious examples.  The center of the play -- a gay man discovering his love of baseball -- is full of screaming-queen cliche, done to perfection by Denis O'Hare on Broadway but alarmingly vacant and stereotypical on the page.  Greenberg can't capture these voices, or an American voice, as he piles unconvincing plot turn upon incomprehensible plot twist as the play wears on.  <br />If you think smug rhetorical ejaculations such as, \\"Baseball is better than democracy -- it's more honest\\" are either intelligent or entertaining, then this cringe-inducing embarrassment of a play is for you.	2003-07-28

Here he examines faulty ideas, often finding the grain of truth that's given them wing.  In THE MINIMAL SELF, still deeply relevant to our times, he explains two urges in light of man's destructiveness and our lack of faith in a future: a regressive, narcissistic wish to merge with the environment, in a timeless solipsism that negates the past and the present; or else, a strict adherence to rules and regulations that demand obedience by threat of punishment and retribution, and which harken back to false nostalgia for a simpler past.<br />Lasch shows us that it's much more complicated than that: that our obsession with survival, our lack of faith in language to communicate commonalities (and its exploitation not just by the media but by activists trying to counter the media's insidious influence), and our confusion about how to structure, or de-structure (destroy) our lives leads us back to Freud, back to humility, and back to separation, away from narcissistic fantasies of either merger or omnipotence.  <br />In brilliant, thoughtful, complex prose, Lasch argues for an enlightened dependence, a reliance on the cultural sphere to give meaning to our inner drives and our recognition of the objective outside world, and thoughtfulness and sobriety in place of infantilism and fantasy.  Lasch argues for mature play, and his is a convincing argument.	2003-05-09

And yet if you get past his crazier ideas, and ignore his more obvious ones, there is a radical but deeply felt, empathically reasoned argument about psychic functioning here.  I find Shengold's work deeply moving.  I do wish his clinical examples had more life, and his biographical examples less density; but his work is important and deserving of careful and rigorous reading.	2003-05-07

A bit long in the tooth, but otherwise NEUROSIS AND HUMAN GROWTH delivers a painful message that many of us who have been plagued by personal problems secretly know all too well: we are causing many of our problems and we must change.  Horney, better than anyone I know, shows us why we do what we do and how to change our behavior.  <br />Horney is also an example of a kind of learned human being that exists less and less frequently.  Incredibly well-read, she shows in her writing a variety of interests and specialties that so many psychoanalytic texts lack.  Halfway between theory and self-help, this is one of the most important texts about how to live more happily published in the last century.	2003-04-13

Shengold's writing, while at times needing elaboration and more specific case histories, is beautiful, clear, complex, at times dazzling.  The final chapter is a masterpiece of healing and hope.  An important work.	2003-04-07

I nearly had a breakdown.   I found this book and began to confront, for the first time in my life, my profound fear of death, my pathological inability to accept that it happens.<br />I got involved in destructive relationships, I smoked two packs a day, I drank till 4 in the morning with \\"friends\\".... two years later, I have grieved and confronted my father's death, given up smoking, stopped drinking, and began making smarter sexual choices.<br />Is it all because of this book?  No.  But Becker began me on a road confronting my mortality -- what he would call my creatureliness.  This led to further reading in this area and a radical change in my perspective on my own body. <br />Confronting death makes one grow up -- and it also gives one a real genuine chance at authentic loving.  Investigating Freud, Otto Rank, Fromm, Norman O. Brown, and Kierkegaard (among others) Becker shows himself to be lively, friendly, realistic, severe, grandiose, and humble, all at once.  His genial prose is a delight to read.  Even when he is illuminating the darkest, most frightening areas of human experience, he is rigorous and hopeful and, frankly, utterly bewitching.  <br />Most of the book remains relevant on personal and political grounds.  Only his more fanciful theories of mental illness strike me as irrelevant today, though there is a poetry in them that neurotics (not psychotics) may very well find illuminating.<br />Let's bring Becker back.  It's a delight to see him referenced in Peter Shabad's new psychoanalytic book.  I hope this is a harbinger in a resurgence of Beckerian thought!	2003-03-30

For anyone who has seen an organization or corporation mysteriously fail, but who has felt that there is an unnamed and elusive logic to its fall, would do well to read this book.  Where others see mystery, Kernberg names names.  He locates dynamics at work in individuals and organizations and details their impact on the life of said groups.  He doesn't provide magical answers but his theories are useful because, once one gets beyond the pessimism and the difficulty of the ideas, they seem, frankly, correct, in a gut-instinct way.<br />Everyone has a complex relation to their leaders, and Kernbeg explains the give-and-take of such strange intuitive feelings, the traces of which haunt all institutions.  Particularly charming is Kernberg's insistence that a &quot;slight paranoia&quot; is a healthy attitude in a leader, to fight off envious attacks.  An analyst and the head of the IPA, he knows whereof he speaks.	2003-03-23

By continuing -- mostly convincingly -- to find Freudian thought useful, he eschews the naive humanism one might argue embodied by people like Erich Fromm and Karen Horney.  <br />Whenever one wants to dismiss his insistence on, what at times seems like obsession with, theoretical constructs like castration anxiety and penis envy, when he gets to the meat and potatoes of his theory, he convinces.  Anyone who has sensed a strange pattern or a strange logic in particularly exciting and frustrating sexual relationships will find a lot to comfort him here.  I'd recommend this book to lay readers who have generally strong egos but find that, in sexual areas, their lives don't make sense, their relationships at a much lower level of functioning than the other parts of their lives.<br />If you have trouble integrating sexuality into your life and relationships, and have a general grasp, and affection for, psychoanalytic topics, you will find this book useful.  Kernberg's naievete shows in the obstinacy of his writing, but while one might wish for a clearer explication, it's also clear he's not writing for a general audience.  He leaves little room for disagreement, but it could also be argued that the strength of his convictions is what allows for such original and at times disturbing insight.<br />My gut tells me Kernberg's right more than he's wrong.  The bleakness of his vision has integrity, and the hard lessons he seeks to teach are worth heeding.	2003-03-23

Particularly helpful here are his explorations of Hans Loewald, whose humane and idiosyncratic vision offers great comfort to those whose deepening investigation of psychonalaysis doesn't always seem to offer more enlightenment, only more confusion.  Mitchell, with an eye to that confusion, finds clarity and hope.	2003-03-21

Karen Horney's work is essential reading for anyone suffering from an excess of narcissistic pride.  This work, though, is a curiosity for those who are familiar with her groundbreaking work, found to much better effect in NEUROSIS AND HUMAN GROWTH among others.  Her final lectures give a certain texture to her as a character, and they are poignant as they come at the end of her life.  But without already knowing her work, a general reader is likely to give up halfway here, with a shrug.	2003-03-21

He'd certainly be able to shed some light on what's going on now.  ESCAPE FROM EVIL, while not as rigorous as his earlier work (it was published after his death,  against his wishes) transposes the more individual explorations of death in DENIAL OF DEATH to larger society.  What he finds is not necessarily encouraging, but it is always enlightening, invigorating, and truthful.  He works hard to look at hard realities and, further, though he is not optimistic, he is interested in a rigorous hope, a hope without illusion.  Becker helps you lose your illusions with aplomb.	2003-03-21

He takes the best of the interpersonalists and object-relationalists, views them alternately through lenses of common sense and a rigorous optimism, all framed by a more or less existential approach.  It's great to see Ernest Becker invoked alongside Freud, Rank, Winnicott, Benjamin, Bollas, Mitchell, and Fromm.  Shabad is of the school that sees therapy as, more or less, truth-telling, and he sees technique as a reflection of the concept of truth -- which he privileges, but in a way that doesn't smack of sentimentality in the least.  In fact Shabad seems quite at home with the darkness of human life.  He doesn't equate darkness with pessimism, however.<br />At times Shabad's clinical descriptions lack texture; and at times he does indeed seem to be \\"reinventing the wheel\\" as he cautions against.  His writing can feel a bit rushed and abstract where one would like it to be more specific and patient.  But ultimately he has written a masterpiece.  I have never seen narcissism explained and investigated in this way -- the contemporary American middle-class caretaking character has never been better dramatized and empathized with.  If you suffer from narcissism, or find yourself constantly entrenched with narcissistic people, you will undoubtedly find yourself in these pages, seen with a specificity to which no one else I'm aware of comes close.  Shabad is a real person with a real theory designed for real situations.  Jargon-free, hopeful, and unflinching, he deserves a wide and careful readership.	2003-03-21

Fromm is less good at offering a realistic vision of healthy love.  But even if his superego seems a bit harsh to our contemporary psyches, his vision is essential: love must not be based on sadomasochistic fantasy but on two separate realities that come together for mutual enhancement.	2003-03-17

A spoonful of sugar, indeed!  Viorst mostly makes her case with authority, though one could do without her really rather dreadful poems peppering the text.  Further, her point of view is too often limited to the imagined upper middle class audience one assumes is buying this book.  Nevertheless, the book is useful, as it allows us a clearly-written opportunity to once again remind ourselves of the horrifying truths psychoanalysis has unearthed, to the benefit of our having a realistic approach to the world.	2003-03-17

Herzog implies that homosexuality is a symptom of father hunger, at least for heterosexual men, and his evocative and elusive text makes a good case.  Because Herzog is clearly a Winnicottian, he is untouched by the broader social perspective of, say, the interpersonalists.  This is unfortunate but by no means takes away from his achievement.  This book needs to be critiqued, but it also needs to be read.  Those who have fled the Freudian perspective would do well to look here to see what an original, compassionate, and brave soul can do with the most painful, destructive, and frightening areas of self that other therapies neglect, avoid, or explain away.	2003-03-17
