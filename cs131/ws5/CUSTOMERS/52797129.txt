But while his slightly older sisters neglect their duty, he helps his younger sisters save an injured princess. <br /> <br />The story starts there, and never stops moving forward. Jerin has been raised unconventionally for his world. He reads, writes, and knows self-defense as well as tactics and strategy. His kind heart and bravery stand him in good stead as he  faces moral and physical danger, and overcomes it. <br /> <br />Other reviews have focused on the astonishing world-building Wen Spencer did for A Brother's Price, and then get caught up in the political and moral implications of the world, rather than seeing the story as a very fun tale with a resourceful young hero. Because they disagree with the politics of the story, they have marked the tale lower. It seems to me that this story was written as a reaction to some of the \\"feminist utopia\\" fiction that was written in the 1970s and 1980s. It's not so much a \\"nurture determines all\\" world as it is a world where everyone is human, with human ambitions, frailties, and gifts. <br /> <br />Although the prose isn't as jewel-like as the Ukiah Oregon books,  I still intend to keep this book, and re-read it many times. The story is a rollicking adventure story with a plucky young thing, determined to protect both his new family and his birth family.	2005-07-08

What happens when a skeptical Barbary corsair, a man of science and astronomy, is captured and made a thrall in Norway?  What happens when a people who live life full of mythology are confronted with someone who's not afraid of spirits, curses, and otherworldly things, for he doesn't believe in them? What happens when uncanny  plots are then put into motion? <br /> <br />A Mankind Witch is about the clash of worlds and cultures on many levels, and it's a fun read on many levels. <br /> <br />A Mankind Witch is part of the Heirs of Alexandria series, a fantastical alternate history in which magic works, and the famed Library of Alexandria never burned. But don't despair if you haven't read the other very good books in this series, _This Rough Magic_, and _The Shadow of the Lion_. A Mankind Witch stands very well on its own. <br /> <br />This book reads very well as a fantastical look at Norse Mythology, complete with Odin, trolls, dwarves, kobolds, elves, and witches. You can't go wrong putting Grieg on the soundtrack and settling in for a good read. Readers who have little or no acquaintance with Norse Mythology will very much enjoy this book without needing any deeper knowledge of the history behind it. <br /> <br />The book also reads very well as a satirical alternate history. As you recognize different people, you may find yourself snickering uncontrollably, and then reading to find how these people end up working together. <br /> <br />If you read it on both levels, and add in a further level of song and story, this is so very much fun. I'd swear that Mr. Freer used Grieg's _Hall of the Mountain King_ to help him pace the book - it starts quickly, and maintains the tension clear to the finale. I highly recommend this book.	2005-07-03

What would happen if a West Virginia mining town were translated into the middle of the Thirty Years War? _1632_ by Eric Flint is an unusual time travel novel based on that premise. Further books in the series (Ring of Fire, 1633, and 1634: The Galileo Affair) deepen the premise.<br /><br />The Grantville Gazette doesn't just deepen the fun - it widens the fun. Although most of the stories were first printed in Baen's electronic edition, \\"Portraits\\" (by Eric Flint) is new to the paper edition. The stories moved me to laughter (\\"Rudolstadt Colloquy\\") and tears (\\"Anna's Story\\".) The non-fiction articles on technology transfer possible with a realistic assessment of what could be done with a mish-mash of twentieth-century and seventeenth-century technology.<br /><br />I'm hard put to decide which my favorite story was. For me, a good story is one with characters that will stick around in my head for years.<br /><br />Benny will fiddle away in Rudolstadt, as a missionary for old-time music to the seventeenth century. Sarah will forever be exasperated as her father discusses fiscal policy in terms of Federal Reserve Fairies that only work if people believe. Pete Santee will be showing yet another crop of dam'fool kids that a gun only does what it's supposed to  when....<br /><br />The non-fiction is a wonderful bonus. It adds a depth to the fiction, as you realize what constraints the fiction authors were operating under.<br /><br />Eric Flint's experience as an editor of short story collections shows. The whole of this book is greater than the sum of the parts. If you enjoy alternate history, this is a book to pick up. But beware. Don't pick it up in the evening, as it will be hard to put down in time to get a good night's sleep.	2004-10-28

She was smart, principled, and working hard in a hostile world. Ther first three books were marvels of the supernatural mystery sub-genre, morality tales that made me think.<br />Now this is no longer true. I checked Obsidian Butterfly and Narcissus in Chains out from the library, and after this gift book, I shan't read any more Anita Blake. It's just too painful. A woman who had a strong and sincere moral compass in a difficult world now only has a compass for sex. A woman who made choices is now only left with the choice of whether to enjoy being driven to sex, or to whine about it.<br />Carefully woven plots with multiple threads have now given way to a novelette's worth of plot hidden in the sex scenes. Please. Either make it a horrible dream, or put Anita out of her sad and miserable existence. She won't be in my life any more, and I mourn for the Anita Blake I once knew and loved to read.	2004-01-07

It's an original, and lots of fun.<br />Tinker was raised in an eccentric family, and now is the resident junkyard inventor in the strangest city on earth. Pittsburgh is on earth for just one 24-hour period each month. The rest of the time Pittsburgh is on the alternate Earth planet of Elfhome, thanks to a problem with an orbiting stargate that is part of the Chinese space program.<br />Tinker is not your everyday ordinary eighteen-year-old gearhead genius. She's likeable, wry, funny, and unpredictable as she gets over her head in the maneuverings of the NSA, the Earth Interdimensional Agency, and elfhome politics, as well as assorted bad guys.<br />The plot of the book is a wonderful page-turner, and defies genres. The storytelling itself is exquisite. It drew marvelous pictures in my mind that I had never seen before. Tinker is a story to return to over and over.  My hope is that a sequel will come soon with more of the adventures of Tinker. Go Tinker ze domi!	2003-10-31

This book is a wonderful resource - it does not confuse healing with a medical cure, but uses a broader definition of healing.<br />I have given four copies of this book to friends who have either been diagnosed with chronic illnesses (cancer, diabetes) or who have undergone wrenching life changes. All have called or written with stories of how this book has helped them have a new perspective, and to see hope.<br />The essays are also short enough that someone who has very little energy can read the book. Although some of the book is faith-based, it is not faith-specific. It was written after the author and her family underwent a dreadful series of diseases and disasters, and calls on their experiences and faith for some of the illustrations.<br />Affirmation books are generally wishy-washy. I find &quot;new age&quot; stuff to be full of pabulum. This book pulls no punches, and the writing carries an honesty and vigor that is refreshing. This is an excellent book, in every meaning of the phrase.<br />Buy it, for there shall surely come a time that you will either need it immediately, or will need to give it with little warning.	2002-01-30

What a thankless task. He wanted to cut spending. Reagan wanted to cut taxes without cutting services, or making himself unpopular. The end result was record deficits, and a burgeoning debt. <br />Mr. Stockman writes with unflinching candor about his naivete of the political and budget process. He shares his frustrations with the reader. This book is particularly instructive twenty years later as Congress tries to keep the recent tax cut intact without blowing the budget out of the water.

This book is promoted as the best book to use for breast cancer. It is not. Skip the book, and visit the website to see photographs of women who have gone through the surgeries. The first half of the book is about basic breast anatomy and development, and not about the choices needed now. The second half of the book suffers from three problems: old statistics that do not take into account changes in treatment, too much detail on rare complications and types of disease, and too much detail about recurrence. Not recommended.<br />The most serious flaw is that it uses outdated survival and mortality statistics that do not take into account the current treatment protocols. The result is unnecessary fear and panic. There are no good statistics on ten-year survival rates, because the current treatment protocols have not been in use for ten years. The development of changes in chemotherapy, antibodies, and hormonal therapy is changing so rapidly that for at least the next twenty years there will be no good ten-year survival rate statistics. Even the five-year statistics do not give the current picture. Dr. Love only gives one paragraph's worth of guidance on how to interpret the statistics. This can result in resignation and fear, just when one should be preparing to live well and fight hard.<br />The second flaw is that Dr. Love's frustrations with the imperfections of medicine and the slowness of change of the medical system come through. She spends lots of detail on rare complications of surgery, and rare possibilities of recurrence. She agonizes over the fact that any lives are lost. I want that knowledge and compassion in your team. I do not want to sift through this detail when I need to get information on which to base decisions.<br />The final difficulty is not a flaw, but a portion of the book. As a newly diagnosed survivor, I wanted to know what I should do next, what will happen next, and how I can detect any recurrences. Ido not need an entire section for womenwho have recurrences. Fewer than half of women who have breast cancer get recurrences, and right now, I need to concentrate on what I can do to prevent one, not how soon to arrange for hospice in case of recurrence.<br />Instead, try John Link's Survival Manual, or, best of all, Your Breast Cancer Journey from the American Cancer Society	2001-11-15

The Matchmaker became one of the most popular musicals of all time - Hello Dolly. Thornton Wilder's  plays are in production at countless high schools across the country, and that's a pity - few students have the maturity or insight to bring these words strongly to life.<br />Skin of Our Teeth, the story of the Antrobus family in stone age Atlantic City, NJ,  deals with indomitable humanity, and how we can prevail against all odds, but especially against our own impulses. It also brings up the consolations of literature and of past times.<br />Our Town is a simple little play about love and death, and how life is composed as a series of moments. It is so important to live in every, every, moment.<br />The Matchmaker is about living life to the fullest, even in the midst of grief and aging.<br />This makes these plays sound dreadfully simplistic, and full of high-school style morality. Thornton Wilder's writing is full of irony, wit, grace, kind humor, and style. His writing has a deceptive simplicity and rhythm. Read these plays to bring some beauty into your life.	2001-11-15

When I was diagnosed with breast cancer, I needed a way to let my children know what they could expect as far as my therapy, and let them know what might happen emotionally.<br />This is by far the best of several children's picture books written about a parent with cancer. Because it is written and illustrated by two sisters, it conveys what kids want to know. It showed the passage of time during treatment, and it showed that people were loving and kind and hopeful in the midst of a rotten time.<br />This book is excellent, and I would recommend it to any parent who has been diagnosed with cancer as a way to open discussions with elementary-aged and younger children.	2001-11-15

I am glad I did. Save yourself the money.<br />Poor Anita Blake - she started out with such promise. In the first few books, she was a smart, savvy woman who could hold her own against vampires, werewolves, and brujas, as well as assorted other nasties. She solved genuine supernatural mysteries, and solved them in style. In Lunatic Cafe, she even solved two sets of competing mysteries.<br />In this book, thanks to the binding of the Vampire marks that hold her to Jean-Claude and Richard, suddenly Anita *must* have sex with attractive men, whether or not they are complete strangers. This sex is given way more detail than I ever wanted to know, and the mystery is given very little detail.<br />The police that Anita has a long working relationship with suddenly can't stand her. Once the reason is made clear, there's no resolution - the plot thread is just left dangling.<br />For almost three books now, we've seen little of Larry, Anita's apprentice vampire slayer and possibly apprentice necromancer. What happened to him? He gives Anita a relationship with sanity.<br />The mystery itself, finding the kidnapper and killer of the alpha werecreatures, is not given much airplay. When the plot takes up less room than the sex, and the sex involves lots of blood, it's time to leave.<br />Anita has been tough-minded and compassionate. She still is, but she's forgotten a few things. She's now razor-hard, has compassion only for were-creatures and vampires, and seems most interested in a good hard gang-bang. She does have interesting little philosophical musings, but they last only a paragraph at a time, and then it's back to the dance of sex and blood and protection for the were and the vampires.	2001-10-24

The problem is even worse for the game meats. There is no 28-day stretch when all of the mentioned game is in season. In the land of corn-fed deer, there is no way that any of the game hunted could be termed organic. Plaice is the fish of choice, and not easily obtained in Iowa.<br /><br />I can translate aubergine to eggplant, courgette to zuchinni. But when chopped cooked swede was mentioned, I had to do some hunting in other cookbooks to realize that they meant rutabega, and not my Uncle Jon Gustafson.<br /><br />There are other, better, books for my purposes	1997-09-07
US	52797129	R25VNE8JQDFRXW	0875961096	780918395	The Allergy Self-Help Cookbook: Over 325 Natural Foods Recipes, Free of Wheat, Milk, Eggs, Corn, Yeast, Sugar and Other Common Food Allergens	Books	5	26	26	N	N	Excellent resource book for all, not just the allergic.	This book is a both a pain and a blessing. It's a pain, because I never know if a recipe will work. It's a blessing, because when they do work, they are spectacular.     The recipes are easy to follow, and have pleased even the most picky of eaters ( my 5-year-old son and his friends.) The variety is extensive, and substitutions are carefully laid out, along with the changes they will make to the appearance, flavor, and texture of the dish. Unfortunately, not all the recipes work. The Boston Brown Bread is an utter moist gloopy flop, as written.      In spite of the problems with recipes, the reference information is even more valuable; it contains lists of biologic families of foods, (Did you know that mangoes and cashews are in the same family? What about avocado and cinnamon?), information on how to avoid nutritional deficiencies, and an extensive appendix of suppliers.	1997-09-07

Whirlwind Courship is a fun book, with Krentz's usual fiesty heroine and masterful hero. The real riches are found in High Energy.  <br /> It has been years since I've laughed out loud so much during one book. It is full of very well written  humor. Neither the male nor female love interest is overbearing or full of angst; they find themselves tangled in each other emotionally and physically.  <br /> The hero, Tyberius Augustus Evans, is a brilliant, rich, sexy, eccentric  physicist. The heroine, Zanita Masterson, is no mere place holder, but is a funny, wry reporter for a small-town newspaper. When she stumbles into his professional seminar and sees a way to get an interview withthe famous recluse, she can't resist luring him into it. But he has decided to lure her into something decidedly different... <br /> I've enjoyed Dara Joys futuristic romances, but I sincerely hope that she writes more romps like this	1997-08-31

Lord John makes a marvelously unrepentant &quot;Lord of Sex.&quot; Chloe is wonderful as the girl who makes marriage a game with him. The book is full of well meaning relatives, and the setting, England during the French Revolution, allows weaving in of the Scarlet Pimpernel. <br />  This is full of Dara Joy's wonderful humor, and steamy love scenes. The only beef that I have is that the love scenes sometimes interfere with the plot, instead of naturally flowing through the plot. But what can you expect with Don Juan? <br />  A wonderful, funny read.  I hope that she does the Scarlet Pimpernel with full book treatment as well	1997-08-31
