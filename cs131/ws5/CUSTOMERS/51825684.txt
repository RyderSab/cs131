The Dirty Seven Sisters: A Dating Guide for the 21st Century	Books	5	8	10	N	N	DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE FUNNY TITLE & SEXY COVER!	Don't be fooled by the funny title and sex cover.  This book has a lot to say about what men need to watch out for when they get emotionally involved with women.  It's only natural for us men to look at a woman's beauty, femininity, and sexiness.  But without considering the character, unselfishness, and intelligence of a woman, a man could lose a lot of money in alimony payments besides the emotional misery from a failed relationship.    As a guy I was particularly interested in the concept of the Dirty Seven Sisters.  These are the women who \\"Booby Trap\\" men with their looks and sexiness, but cause enormous emotional pain before and after a divorce.  I recognized one of these \\"Dirty Sisters\\" as the type of woman who almost trapped me years ago and thank heavens ended it herself.  I would have stayed on course like a lemming with her to the bitter end.    The celebrity references make for interesting reading.  It's like opening a People Magazine and this feature holds a reader's attention with well-known examples.    Finally, readers should benefit from the reality that some people are not good mating material and should be avoided at all costs.  These \\"Dirty Sisters\\" with their character flaws will keep themselves in a holding pattern of poor behavior.  These women also don't have the skills, heart, or insight to sustain a happy, mutually fulfilling relationship.  As sexy and gorgeous as some women may be, it's important to know that they are like Venus Flytraps or Black Widow spiders who capture and devour unsuspecting males.     For men who get \\"hooked\\" too much on a woman's looks, this is a must read.....and most men that I know fall into this category unfortunately!	2005-02-13

In my search for new information on dating, romance, and love relationships, I've come across a real winner for women and men who don't fit the traditional Mars-Venus stereotypes. <br /> <br />First of all this is not a book that recommends that all women should take the lead (Be on top!) in their marriages.  In fact, women who are more the \\"Surrender Wife\\" types should probably stay away from this book unless they want their belief systems shaken and minds opened up. <br /> <br />But for women who are naturally dominant, this is a unique book with information and strategies for creating a happy marriage with a different kind of man than they were originally taught to desire.  The fact is that there are some men who enjoy a strong, powerful woman and such a woman should not be discouraged from being her natural self in the relationship world.  Instead, she should retain what makes herself special and look for a different kind of man who appreciates and likes the way she is. <br /> <br />Women will especially like: <br /> <br />*  An entire chapter on how to train your man to do housework. <br />*  Interviews with men who enjoy being in a women-led marriage. <br />*  The 4 Essential Characteristics of a Good Man <br /> <br />This book is an interesting and enlightening mix of solid spiritual principles and heartfelt personal experiences.  It offers a simple but effective recipe for take-charge women who want to succeed in romance as well as career.  It is a welcome break from the Mars and Venus strategies that don't apply in some romantic situations.	2005-02-10

I just finished reading this book and came away fascinated and humbled by what's been going on in the world.  It truly is a global chess game with many secret agendas and clever players trying to survive. <br /> <br />I've read many of the reviews posted here and rather than repeat what I've seen here I'll just suffice to say that this is essential reading for anyone who wants to make any strong statements for or against the United States foreign policy....whether you're a Blue State or Red State mentality. <br /> <br />I disagree with the reviews that talk about all of this being in the news already.  I follow the news and I sure must of missed this kind of analysis.  In fact I'm convinced that the American public cannot be fully told what's really going on strategically because it simply \\"can't handle the truth!\\" <br /> <br />If we're going to play hardball in world politics with the likes of Iraq, Iran, Russia, China, France, Al-Quada, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Pakistan, then we have to be sure that everyone can't read our hand so easily.  We have to deal with all the other players on an even playing field....the masses can't really know our complete strategy. <br /> <br />Enough said....great book and I highly recommend it.  It will bring meaning to your watching of the news.	2004-12-07

I like to recommend this book to women who ask me questions on iVillage.com because I think that the tasks that appear in this book can help round out a woman's personality and help take the edge off of a lot of her relationship anxieties. <br /> <br />I get a kick out of the \\"Claim your granny panties\\" chapter which is about being a woman who is truly at ease with herself when she's wearing unsexy skivvies. <br /> <br />I also like the chapter on \\"Stop slamming other women\\" which is what I see happening way too much these days.  It would be a lot better if women called a truce on each other and tried more for camaraderie....like sisters. <br /> <br />So be sure to get a copy of this light self-help/humor book which isn't an intimidating or overwhelming \\"To Do List\\" that makes women feel like they're lacking or incomplete.  It's more about sisterly advice and having a fun look at the challenges of getting older.  <br />	2004-11-13

This is the perfect attitude (beliefs) adjustment for those men and women who are struggling in their love lives with issues around resentment, uncertainty, control, commitment, frustration, and the \\"What's in it for me attitude\\" that is so prevalent today.<br /> <br />As an online relationship advisor (Host of iVillage.com's Ask Mr. Answer Man discussion board), I receive several questions a day from concerned women about their love lives.  And I concur with author, Allie Ochs, that we are \\"human beings first, men or women second and need to treat each other as equals.\\"  While so many women view our dating process as some sort of \\"battle of the sexes\\" it is refreshing to know that there are books like this which make a big point of finding long-term success through character (honesty, responsibility, integrity, determination) rather than by dating \\"rules\\" or clever mind-game strategies.<br /> <br />There is timeless wisdom in this book (excellent chapter summaries with bullet points to remember) which makes it a valuable addition to any woman's personal development and relationship library.  With this book you can get the love thing straight for once and for all.	2004-07-20

I saw Rodney a couple of years ago in the Salt Lake City airport sitting in a chair waiting for his flight to LAX with his wife.  He looked old and frail, but I gave him a wave and he gave me back a wink with his trademark okay sign.  That was very cool.<br />So when I bought this book I was really looking forward to an interesting read....and I found it.<br />This book has a tons of jokes that are used to separate his stories (and he's got a lot of them) within the chapters.  I now realize how hard he worked and really how little he received back in terms of material riches.  (He only received $35,000 for Caddyshack with no residuals!) <br />There are so many funny stories about show business, struggling as a comedian, sex, women, drugs, his youth, his health, friends, marriage, and of course, not getting any respect.<br />I know that Rodney may not be with us very long as he is in his 80's and dealing with health issues, but I feel lucky to have seen him since the Ed Sullivan days, through the Johnny Carson years, the Miller Lite Beer commercials, the hilarious movies, and up to my incident at the Salt Lake City airport.<br />Here's a real success story in disguise from a kind man who has made us all laugh for decades.<br />This book adds so much to my appreciation of this humble and very human man.  I'm going to watch \\"Back To School\\" and \\"Caddyshack\\" again soon.<br />Thanks Rodney.  You have my respect.	2004-07-08

I never knew that Jay Mohr, the host of NBC's \\"The Last Comic Standing\\" was a performer on Saturday Night Live until I read this book.  I had seen him play a jerk sports agent in the movie \\"Jerry McGuire\\" and I've also heard him on the Jim Rome Show, however.<br />This is an interesting read (a good but not great book) about the challenges he faced as a struggling comedian and writer trying to make it on Saturday Night Live.  What is most interesting are the inside stories about other performers like Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, David Spade, Chris Farley, Norm McDonald, Mike Myers, and Phil Hartman.  There are also some funny things about some of the guest hosts like Marisa Tomei, Rosanne Barr, Eric Clapton, and Christopher Walken to name a few.<br />What I never would have guessed is that Jay suffers from severe panic attacks.  He has always seemed to be so totally in control of things and it makes him seem like a much more real person.  To see how well he's done since the Saturday Night Live gig is a true success story.<br />For people who enjoy \\"The Last Comic Standing\\" or are \\"Jungle clones\\" from the Jim Rome Show, I think that you'll like this book and come away with a new found respect for this brilliant and dedicated entertainer.<br />Great job JJ!	2004-07-02

The personal stories and savvy advice are something that I found as a general overview rather than the more strategic information that I'm sure most people were expecting.<br />For hardened business people, this book will disappoint.  But I found it to be more informative and interesting than say the \\"One Minute Manager\\" books or the \\"Fish\\" business books which sell for also the same price and are less than 100 pages.<br />\\"How to Be Rich\\" looks like something that was slapped together quickly to take advantage of the Apprentice show's popularity.  I really wished that Trump and the editors of Random House would have held back on this and had more quality control.<br />The book has been fatten up with pictures and a lot of spacing to make this 244 page book look bigger in content than it really could be.  It has more like 144 pages of information and could have sold for $15 instead.  I guess someone needed the money, right?<br />All in all, this is an okay book that is easy to read.  And fans of the Apprentice who really aren't searching for groundbreaking financial advice and just want a little time with the Donald will find this an enjoyable read.<br />Since the price of the book kind of bugs me, that's telling me that I need to make more money!!!	2004-04-13

As a dating/relationship author and online advisor I'm always interested in what others have to say about this popular subject.  So when this book appeared I went out and bought it right away.<br />First off, I think that this is a good book that most young women will enjoy reading.  Since we already know so much about these authors in a dating sense (we visited their homes and met their families!), it makes for interesting reading.<br />Bachelor II was my favorite in the series because there were actually high expectations that this format would work.  Since then the romance/reality angle was become overworked and I think Trista and Ryan finally burned us out.<br />But I think these women have something interesting to say.  After all, they are intelligent women who have probably been obsessed with the dating subject for a few years now.  Some of the highlights include:<br />* Look Beyond Looks:  Looks have become less important for me.  I don't care if he's on the cover of GQ magazine, if doesn't treat me well, what's that?  Nothing.<br />* Pump Your Own Gas:  Gwen has had luck at the self-service island.  \\"Guys will pump gas right next to me and they'll peer around and start talking.  You'd be surprised how many people do that.\\"<br />* Make Sure He's Single:  Be wary of the separated but not divorced.  Somebody's who's already in a relationship and trying to start another one would be a deal breaker.<br />* Watch For Family Ties:  Listen to what the guy says, about his relatives.  If a guy has a good connection with his mother, it says a lot.  If there are problems with his family, they'll be problems for you.<br />I'm sure that there will be some people who want to criticize this book, but it is done in a lighthearted way and truly reflects what these women have personally experienced.  They also don't profess to be \\"know-it-alls\\" which is refreshing.  Hopefully, they won't be carrying around too much emotional baggage from their experiences on The Bachelor.  <br/>I've always contended on my radio interviews that the format that Gwen and Helene participated in doesn't work.  An old American proverb reads:  a man chases a woman until she catches him.  In \\"The Bachelor\\" the women do the chasing, and the man ends up with a bigger ego and wants both more women and more challenging women.<br />So for Gwen and Helene I hope this book does well and that people will benefit from their unique position as celebrity authors and a pretty good lighthearted book.	2004-02-11

After a complete reading of this book where I took a lot of notes, I must say that it does an outstanding job of covering online dating and other related topics.<br />You get a certain type of quality when you buy a \\"Dummies\\" book.  I didn't expect this one to be a great literary read or even one that I'd call \\"entertaining\\" (except for the hilarious cartoons in the beginning of each chapter).  This book is simply stuffed with practical information and helpful tips.  I do a lot of research on \\"Online Dating\\" issues and this is the best single source that I've found.  If you ever come across any of my advice anywhere, you can bet that it won't be out of alignment with what is in this great resource.<br />This is a book that every man or woman who chooses to play the \\"online dating game\\" to win (find a good love partner) should have in their personal library.

Heres a wonderful book written by Leah Lauber when she was a 12 years old fan and junior reporter for the St. Petersburg Times as she followed the history-making U.S. Womens Soccer Teams championship run in the 1999 World Cup.<br />The book is a real page-turner with behind-the-scenes photographs and interviews with such stars as Mia Hamm and Brandi Chastain to name a few.<br />While the book captures the dream-come-true success of the Womens U.S. Soccer Team, the real story is about Leah and her fabled journey from youth soccer to the locker room of the biggest event in womens sports history.  Her hard work and commitment to her dream is what made her story and eventually this book all happen.<br />This is especially inspiring to any girl who is involved in youth sports, music, or other arts, where there is a big dream, a special hero, and a love for the activity that makes the journey even more rewarding than the outcome.  I know it sounds cliché, but this book captures one of the most significant ingredients to success:  that great results only come when you have a deep love for what you do.  <br />I hope that enlightened parents across the country will make sure that their daughters get a copy of this book for the wonderful story and personal inspiration that this book uniquely provides.

Here's an interesting nuts & bolts dating book that people are going to be talking about a lot.  Overall, this is a very impressive piece of work and probably the best of its kind (getting a man to fall in love with more respect and passion).  For the woman looking for a more tactical approach to dating, this is your cup of tea.<br />\\"Why Men Love B!tches\\" does a great job of advising women on how to maintain more respect and dignity in their romantic relationships and gain the love of a man as a result.  Her 100 Attraction Principles are extremely well thought out and offer the reader a great deal to chew on.  <br />Not only does she have great principles, her book is loaded with interesting features like sample scenarios (The Spontaneous Guy Who Is Treating You Like a Backup vs. The Spontaneous Guy Who Adores You), \\"She says/He says\\" tables, and \\"The Nice Girl vs. The B!tch\\" comparisons.<br />My favorite principle of Sherry's is:  Before sex a man isn't thinking clearly and a woman is thinking clearly.  After sex, it reverses.  The man is thinking clearly and the woman isn't.<br />Another good one is:  Anytime a woman competes with another woman, she demeans herself.<br />And for good measure:  Act like a prize and you'll turn him into a believer.<br />There are 97 more of these and all of them have something insightful to say regarding earning respect, maintaining dignity, being independent, gaining self-confidence, using humor effectively, the allure of feistiness, getting satisfying sex, creating a challenge, stirring up his desire, ending female neediness, getting rid of nagging, the effectiveness of action instead of words, and much, much more.<br />For \\"nice women\\" who have been treated as a doormat and don't know why, here's a book with virtually \\"all the answers.\\"  It is also written in a very humorous tone with examples from popular movies and personal stories of the author and her friends.<br />I also highly recommend \\"Why Men Love B!tches\\" for anyone who wants to recapture the passion and respect of the male partner who's gone romantically dormant.<br />The Bottom Line:  This book gives the reader the \\"tactical edge\\" on many key love situations and is a fun read that women around the country are going to enjoy talking about.  (Maybe even New York City's Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte, and Amanda!)	2004-01-20

Here's a dating/relationship book that women are really going to enjoy reading.  It is packed with helpful pointers, hilarious phrases, and sassy female insights.  As a fellow author in this genre I'm always checking out what other authors are saying and E. Jean Carroll has become up with a clever plan that should be very useful for eager bachelorettes looking for a great boyfriend with upside potential.<br />The book is based on something the author calls \\"The Man Catching Method\\" which says that:  1)  Mother Nature designed women to find and seduce a man, 2)  Men decide pretty much everything about a woman in the first 30 seconds, and 3) When a woman meets a man and they like each other they will synchronize or click.<br />This book is about getting a man to fall in love with a woman and not about getting married or being responsible in a love relationship.  It is focused on getting that fast and secure attachment with a man and then deciding later whether the woman actually wants to keep him or not.<br />With this limited scope, the author takes the reader on a 6 week journey that covers:  1)  acquiring the proper aloof mindset, 2) looking appealing in a man's eyes, 3) getting a firm grip on debilitating fear, 4) 119 places where to meet men & smart online strategies, 5) how to initiate contact, 6) asking a man out on a date, 7) some insights about intimidating men, 8) when to have sex in order to drive the man wild, and 9) 79 ways to lose the man that's been caught.<br />What is probably underappreciated about this book is how the author uses credible sources in the behavioral sciences to back up her claims.<br />And what is most delightful about this book (even for a male reader like me) is the absolutely hilarious way the author makes her points.  Like a comedian, there's something funny every paragraph or so.  And it's tasteful, intelligent humor too!<br />In the genre of dating books this one really stands out as about the most entertaining and helpful in its limited scope (getting a man to fall in love) of just about any one I've ever come across.	2004-01-15

As a dating/relationship author I am always on the search for new information or alternative perspectives on my subject.  I came across this author's work on the recommendation of one of my own customers.<br />At first (being a guy) I wasn't expecting to like the whole \\"Modern-Day Cupid\\" idea.  But I must admit this book has a certain edge to it that I think practical dating people are going to find useful.  This is not a \\"Dating For Dummies\\" type book with a million ideas thrown together, but more a focused guide on the most important things to work on.<br />The two authors have something like 45 years of professional matchmaking experience which, when you come to realize it, makes their advice worth paying attention to (They would not have stayed in business unless they could produce results.)<br />While most all dating/relationship authors say something about these prerequisites for love:  1)  defining what you want, 2)  developing self-confidence, and 3)  becoming attractive, this book also points out how important it is to understand who you really are as a person.  While this may sound very simplistic, the authors point out how many people haven't thought much about what makes them tick and what makes them feel happy/fulfilled.<br />The major reoccurring theme which I agree with wholeheartedly is that a man or woman must operate from a position of strength is order to have the relationship that they want.  It is this strength (confidence, wisdom, centeredness, values, principles) that allows a dater to recognize the so-called \\"red flags\\" and act accordingly with their best interests in mind.<br />In a time when the dating public seems to be so misguided by pop culture advice, here's a thorough book based on extensive matchmaking experience that still has the wisdom, humor, and practical information to make your dating game winnable.<br />This is one of my new favorites in the dating/relationship genre.	2003-10-28

FOR TOP CEO'S, ENTREPENEURS, SERIOUS BUSINESS STUDENTS, AND WISE VALUE INVESTORS<br />As a \\"value investor\\" who is interested in buying only the shares of America's finest companies, I was attracted to this excellent book.  <br />While the current best-seller \\"Good to Great\\" deals with some of the traditional big name companies like Coke and Gillette, this book has uncovered some interesting gems like Clear Channel Communications, Goldcorp, and Paychex to name a few.<br />For me there isn't a whole lot of value in reading any more about the triumphs of Microsoft, General Electric, Home Depot, Dell Computer, Intel and the like.  What's the advantage of knowing this?  (Unless you already own the stock and need justification for holding on to them)<br />What makes this book so special is its emphasis on up-to-date strategies, mostly those of companies since 1992.  The best companies that are featured in this book did not have the advantages of massive market share from previous eras.  Instead they relied on constant and never-ending improvement on their business model in the ever changing global markets.<br />If you want to learn something new about how these companies outperform their competition, then this book will give you the answers for now and in the future.  This book fills in the gaps that \\"Good to Great\\" misses out on.<br />I'd recommend any serious student of business, CEO, or value investor, to buy both \\"Good to Great\\" and \\"The Ultimate Competitive Advantage.\\"  <br />But this one, while not being as well known, may be much more valuable for your own future.	2003-08-12

Im sure we can all think of a person that we know who fits one of these bills:<br />1)  Daddys Girl:  no ones can live up to Daddy<BR>2)  The Barbie Doll:  the perfect girl as long as youth & beauty last<BR>3)  The Girls Girl:  the perfect friend to every woman at the expense of her own love life<BR>4)  The Material Girl:  the one who appears to want money more than love<BR>5)  The Miss Priss:  the one who lives by family standards primarily<BR>6)  The Corporate Cat:  the female executive with all the perks except a man<BR>7)  The Chatty Cathy:  talks too much, too many stories<BR>8)  The Jockette:  one of the boys in her recreational activities<BR>9)  The Mirror: the one who surrenders to men at her own expense<br /> ------------------------<br />My only beef appears on page 22 where she writes, Hes the Hook, But Youre the Fish.  And on a philosophical level I have to let her know that an old American proverb states, a man chases a woman until she catches him.  What that means is the woman is the angler and the man is the fish.  (The Power of An Enlightened Metaphor For Love)<br />Back to her book.<br /> ------------------------<br />As far as Walshs tests, there are actually 5 of them, all of which are very practical and insightful.  Here they are with my favorite question from each test:<br />The Hook-Up Test (sounds fishy doesnt it?):  Question #2 Areyou more worried about your appearance than your disposition?<br />The First Date Test:  Question #7  Do you talk too much about past relationships?<br />The Five Date Test:  Question #5  Are you rewarding bad-boy behavior?<br />The Girlfriend Sex Test:  Question #9  Do you know how to say no to sex?<br />The Ninety-Day Test:  Question #3  Do you know how to deal with the boys club?<br />Along the way the author also has important side-bars like tips on going out alone (valet park for safety, meet the business happy hour people instead of the late-night crowd & leave by 11:30 PM because nothing good ever happens after that).<br />I hope this book gets in the hands of a lot of women.  I said much of the exact same things in my second edition of Men Are Like Fish, but the difference here is that it comes from the more trusted voice of another woman instead of from a guy (the nerve of a man talking about love....what do they know, right?)<br />Anyway, dont be fooled by the whole test idea.  While it is more on the tactical side than the spiritual side, it does a darn good job of making refined distinctions in the area of hooking (creating secure attachments wisely).<br />This is one of my favorite new books because it is so focused on this one area of dating which is a key element in the big picture of fishing for love.	2003-05-20

Sharon, the central character, also has issues with her mother and her father that she's able to resolve through the course of the book.  This process along with the support of a skilled therapist also helps Sharon to complete her heartbreaking love affair with David, the ambivalent boyfriend.<br />The book is written from Sharon's voice as well as David's voice so a man like myself gets to see both sides of the story.  I also can identify with the ongoing Wall Street trading story that runs throughout the book.<br />Mourning Losses is a very real-life depiction of how a woman with complex issues (emotional separation from her mother, mourning the loss of her father, finding herself through work and creativity, exploring her sexuality, and searching for true love) moves forward in her life with honesty and deeper appreciation for your own self-worth.<br />This is a delightfully enlightened story about the difficult struggles that many women face and what most men have no clue about.	2003-05-19

Simply put:  a great gift book for Valentines' Day!<br />I really enjoyed reading this &quot;greatest hits&quot; album of Mars and Venus.  It's short, easy to read, and fun, yet its simple messages can probably save a lot of marriages.<br />Like a lot of people, I've already read the original Mars and Venus book along with a few more in the series.  That first one was the biggest-selling relationship/self-help book of the 1990's according to USA Today.  But here in 2003, people are still looking for the same quality of information and wisdom but perhaps in a more interesting format for our &quot;shorter than 1990's&quot; attention spans.<br />As a fellow author in this genre, I'm often times skeptical about new books on relationships (like what's new or original about this).  But in the case of John Gray I have the utmost respect......his books are wise, valuable and fun to read.<br />And this one is the most fun of them all!<br />Some interesting, well-illustrated points include:<br />*  Men think that women want to change them and women think that men don't listen.<br />*  Men go into their caves to solve problems and women want to talk about them.<br />*  Men are like rubber bands:  when a man loves a woman he periodically needs to pull away before he can get closer.<br />*  Women are like waves:  a woman will rise and fall in her ability to love themselves and others.<br />For those looking for practical, ready-to-use advice, you'll like the &quot;25 ways to score big on Venus&quot; (plan a date several days in advance, give her a hug before anything else, when listening make eye contact) and &quot;25 ways to score big on Mars&quot; (ask his opinion, practice accepting his imperfections, admire his strengths and talents).<br />There are also important chapters about how to handle arguments, how to give up changing a man, how to ask for support, and a new one for me.....the seasons of love....which was a nice little treat.<br />At a unique time when the pop culture is so fixated on the likes of The Bachelor, Joe Millionaire, Blind Date, and the Bachelorette, it's nice to come back to the wisdom of Mars and Venus in a more condensed, up-to-date, and cleverly illustrated package.ture is so fixated on the likes of The Bachelor, Joe Millionaire, Blind Date, and the Bachelorette, it's nice to come back to the wisdom of Mars and Venus in a more condensed, up-to-date, and cleverly illustrated package.	2003-01-21

As a fellow self-help/relationship author, I'm always curious what other people are writing about in my subject matter.  And being a guy, I find that what women have to say is particularly interesting.<br />This book which is geared more toward the under 30 crowd is well-written and interesting.  It's front cover doesn't do it justice however (a graphic art look would have been nice).<br />I like the \\"Dates From Hell\\" sidebars along with some interesting features and subtitles like:  First Date Conversation No-No's (diseases, obsessive behaviors, friends in jail), Top Ten Rejection Lines and What They Mean (I'm not attracted to you in \\"that way\\" means I'm not attracted to you, period.), What Is It About Bad Boys, and The One: Why Do Guys Expect To Find a Beautiful Princess.<br />Here's a book with a lot of potential that needs an expert co-author for more authority, a new catchy title, and better packaging (Sex and the City-type colors/graphics).  <br />At a time when the public is so enamored with popular television shows like The Bachelor, Joe Millionaire, and The Bachelorette, this is a delightful little book that young single people could really benefit from and enjoy.<br />The Bottom Line:  it's got some good original stuff!	2003-01-21

This classic relationship book is still selling well because of the insane popularity of new television shows like Sex and the City, The Bachelor, Joe Millionaire, and The Bachelorette.<br />Why are people buying these relationship books?  <br />The answer for most women is because of the necessity to understand how men think and behave.  Additionally woman need to appreciate men for who they really are because in today's popular culture, men can act very mysteriously.<br />Herb Goldberg's book is pre-Mars & Venus which I think is a more readable book than this one.  But I got my start in studying relationships by reading Dr. Goldberg's other great work titled, \\"The New Male.\\"<br />I read this book the other day because I'm doing research for my third book which addresses typical women's questions about today's reality romance shows.<br />In reading this book I found two parts that I think are very valuable.  One is the section titled, \\"Men's Blind Spots:  How He Distorts His Relationships\\" which has 12 specific behavior patterns described in detail (very right on).  The other section I like is titled, \\"Loving Him As He Wants To Be Loved\\" which I think are very true and can help women create a more secure emotional attachment.<br />As a writer in this subject matter, this is one of those books that I like to have in my library so that I can refer to it from time to time on core relationship principles.  This is not a book for entertainment, but one for reference.<br />I can't disagree with any of the other reviewers for this book.  Some will find it redundant, others will find it informative, and many will think it's boring.  But for a few dollars, you get some valuable information from a highly credible source.<br />If you're a woman who is confused by the mixed signals that men give off in love relationships, this book may offer you some clues.  Just don't expect to be entertained or amused.  This is serious stuff that is written in a more formal tone.  But knowing men's love blind spots may be worth your while.  (It was for me!)	2003-01-16

Heres a refreshing, uplifting dating/relationship book that I think women (and some curious men like me) will really enjoy and find interesting.  Unlike a lot of books about dating, this one tells it like it is from both the mens and womens point-of-view.<br />As an author in this same field, Im always on the look out for new material on my (relationship/self-help) subject matter.  This one does a fantastic job of covering the basics of getting a date. (self-confidence, eye contact, conversations, smiling, understanding men, attraction, sex issues, fear of rejection, positive affirmations, being accessible, being yourself vs. playing games, helping a man to ask a woman out, and safety issues) in a light-hearted and entertaining read.<br />This is a book you can skim through and skip from chapter to chapter.  The author has a special talent for clever phrases/subtitles, useful analogies (including my men are like fish metaphor!), funny little anecdotes, and well-stated major points that make this dating book truly unique and valuable.<br />Some of my favorite points are:<br />* No action = no love result.<BR>* When someone does not want you that never means theres something wrong with you.<BR>* The right man for you will love you for what is most unique about you.<BR>* Never underestimate the value of a smile.<BR>* Think of the world as a party and you are the host.  It is your job to make sure that everyone feels welcome and is having a good time.<br />The most valuable and probably most under-appreciated section of this book is about self-fulfilling prophecies, beliefs, expectations, negative anchors, the path of destiny, and handling rejection.  Im really impressed with the research the author did in this area and she does a thorough job of explaining these hard-to-comprehend concepts in the dating context.<br />For the woman looking to master the first step in loving relationships (getting a date), Master Dating is a must to own.  Its a far more interesting read than the Dummies Book with all the important content and the special talents of a very personable and gifted writer/observer.  <br />I eagerly look forward to reading what else she may have to say about the other phases of love relationships.	2003-01-13

As a former trainer in NLP for 7 years I've always been impressed with how effective these techniques are for creating internal change (habits, behaviors, disciplines, overcoming fears, sales, etc.)<br />But the ability to create change in other people (like getting a man to fall in love with you) is something that I believe from my experience in the field almost no one can achieve on their own with NLP.<br />I wrote my fishy relationship/self-help book because I saw how different the real works as opposed to the NLP-seminar-John Gray-Tony Robbins models.  That experience came from dating in Southern California and going on a lot of cruises and Club Med vacations. <br />What I found is that people who try to use NLP techniques come across as being weird.  It also has a strange way of messing with the natural karma of love.  For whatever reason, when you try to get someone else to fall in love with you through an organized skill set like this, it has a way of ruining the magic for yourself.<br />What is important to know from Tracy's book are the general concepts of sensory acuity and anchoring.  Sensory acuity comes in handy when you recognize when you get an instant negative reaction (like bad breath, body odor, unappealing voice, talk too fast, talk too loud, talk too slow, talk too much).  These things cause a person to be out of rapport.  Which means an unconscious bad first impression.<br />Anchoring has to do with creating stirring memories or special moments.  This book is about the mechanics of creating those moments which is all right, but the average person needs to feel it come naturally from within.<br />If a woman really wants to know how to get a man to fall in love, she must first maximize her own feminine allure (Being a Woman by Dr. Toni Grant) and then make her contacts and develop relationships.  Dr. Cabot's work will help you with identifying technical mistakes, but not some much about having more to give (variety, intensity, heart), cleansing the spirit, and understanding and appreciating a love partner.<br />As an author, NLP trainer, and semi-relationship expert, I think that this book addresses the 20% of mechanics when it's done right (a very difficult task without years of training and integration...not just in a simple reading of a book!)  But what most people really need is the 80% of how loving relationships work from within on the emotional-spiritual world.  <br />My advice here is to enjoy this book and become more aware of instant triggers, but don't get carried away and become a weirdo!<br />Weirdness spooks men away quickly!<br />Remember that love is far more spiritual than mechanical.	2003-01-08

First of all, I like James Dines as an investment newsletter writer.  I've also heard him speak in person and thought that he was exceptionally good.  What I am about to say about this particular book is only based on my opinion of  this piece of work.<br />_________<br />Here's a book that fans of James Dines, the original gold-bug may find a treasure to own. I think that his investment newsletter is interesting to read because of his unique writing style and in-depth analysis. I especially find his political/terrorism takes to be very interesting.<br />But this book is not something that I've enjoyed that much. It's basically a collection of self-coined quotations that are organized like a quotation book (which are not very interesting to read as a rule). There aren't any stories or cartoons or commentary/sidebars from Mr. Dines which would have made it far more interesting.<br />This looks like a cheap production where someone went through all his newsletters and snipped out little pieces. Now I realize that the book was intended for speech writers, but I think it could have used a lot more imagination in creating the final product.<br />Mr. Dines could have done a whole lot better if he would have invested more time, money and creativity into this book project. It's a shame to have so much great content wasted on a low-budget production.<br />The Dines Letter is a far more superior product than this.	2003-01-07

There's a simple company profile, earning projection, revenue growth chart, and key financial ratios. <br />Since all of these things can be gotten over the Internet these days, the main benefit of this book is that it is in book form and you can pick it up for stock ideas in the tech area (except for IBM and HPQ).<br />The only thing that I found interesting was the author's Top 25 Picks for 2002-2003. This list includes all the big cap tech stocks except QCOM and has some comments about each choice. There's also an interesting discussion about the QQQ's and the Rydex funds and how it might be better for most investors to simply buy these instead of riding the ups and downs of these highly-volatile individual issues.<br />I would like to have seen a more lively format, but I guess this book wasn't meant for my entertainment.

As the author of a self-help/relationship book, I'm always looking out for new resources to improve my writing or develop ideas.  My first book used &quot;The New Beacon Book of Quotations For Women&quot; as a primary resource and my next book will use this book extensively.<br />As a man I find that women writers tend to be more colorful, personal, and subtle in their choice of words.  That is why I prefer this type of book over a giant glossary of quotations.<br />The best part of this book is the way the quotations are assembled around motivational-personal development themes.  The choice of these themes shows a lot of enlightened thought and understanding by the editor, Leslie Ann Gibson.  I've never seen such a high-quality collection of quotations around such well-chosen themes.<br />The only thing that I miss is a more thorough biographical index.  It's hard for me to write or speak about what someone says unless the audience (and myself) knows who it is.  So unfortunately, I have to spend a lot of additional time researching.<br />But all things considered this is a truly fine book that all serious writers and speakers should have in their personal libraries.	2002-12-18

Cramer is an easy target for criticism, but this simple book has tremendous value.<br />I took this book with me on a 7 day Caribbean cruise and had a great time reading it under the coconut trees of St. Maarten and Antigua. Being away from CNBC, Wall Street Week, and the constant media attention to the stock market was a welcome reprise.<br />And so was this book.<br />At first glance this book may seem a little bit light on information. It's only 117 pages long at a time when we expect about 300 pages from a typical John Wiley-type finance book. But it's not the number of pages that counts, it's the information, personal interpretations by Cramer, and solid financial wisdom that matter.<br />By the time I actually got around to reading this book (on those great beaches), I must say that I truly enjoyed it!<br />The book is divided into 3 very distinct parts. <br />The first part is about how the public got totally used by Enron, Worldcom, and Rhythms Net type scandals. Since all of these events were so recent it doesn't take long before you start recalling all the pieces of information that came out about these cases. Mr. Cramer does a nice job of taking us all back to those days and recapping what went wrong. Each one was revealing in its own unique way. And yes, we got used!<br />The second part pinpoints the other culprits in the stock market's two and a half year demise (and giant NASDAQ crash!). Cramer reminds as of the all-stocks-all-the-time mentality that came to be at the market's peak. Also the potential danger of executive options, shady accounting, too many one-way mutual funds, and always bullish brokerage firms. And by the way, these culprits are still at today!!!<br />And finally, there is the last section about what to do. Here is current advice and simple guidelines to avoid getting used again in the future. Some of the gems are:<br />1) Have some bonds for income<BR>2) Have some cash for annual buying opportunities<BR>3) Buy stocks in incremental\\"get your feet wet\\" amounts<BR>4) Buy at least 5 stocks from 5 different industries<BR>5) It's okay to sell <BR>6) Sell some on the way up<BR>7) Sell your losers because bad stocks may not go up at all<BR>8) Know your stocks and how they make money so you have a feeling of their value.<BR>9) Buy index funds for diversification and low expenses<BR>10) Hedge funds are better than mutual funds in concept. Here's something to research more on. Mutual funds are financial products who's time has gone.<br />For those readers who want an enjoyable read, who watch CNBC, have an interest in tech stocks, and feel like they were used and want to avoid it in the future, here's a book for you. It's a reminder of how to keep your head when things get too crazy on either the upside or downside.<br />A very timely piece!<br />P.S.: As a fellow author I can understand Mr. Cramer's disappointment in the reviewing process. Some people think it's a sign of brilliance to degrade intellectual property when it's simply a matter of them just not getting it. My advice to these negative types is to stand aside if you're not going to be fair. Let the reader have a chance to appreciate the author's work....the content and the spirit.	2002-11-19

Books	5	49	60	N	N	Financial Wake-Up Call: Brilliant Observations!	I've never been a big fan of the Rich Dad series of books. I felt it was the Chicken Soup For the Money Soul \\"book franchise\\" concept and I did want to give it undue props just because it sold a lot. But this one is a real find....a treasure of brilliant observations.<br />Many years ago I attended Tony Robbins' Financial Mastery seminar and author Robert Kiyosaki was one of the presenters. Being of the same heritage, I was happy to see a Japanese-American doing well in a public endeavor. He taught a financial game which was quite good, but after that seminar I didn't hear much of him again until the Rich Dad book came out.<br />The Rich Dad book was originally self-published but sold so well in its first year that Time-Warner bought out the publishing rights. As a fellow author, I figured that the series of books was something that was part of the publishing contract and that these Rich Dad books would come out regardless of the quality of the content. But in this case (Prophecy) I was wrong.<br />Mr. Kiyosaki addresses some key issues that have been largely overlooked by the financial media and therefore the public. Such things as: 1) financial assumptions like the stock market always goes up in the long term, 2) the negative effect of aging baby-boomers in regards to mandatory withdrawals from retirement plans, 3) the excessive number of mutual fund companies who are inheritantly bullish, 4) the lack of truly unbiased financial education, 5) the reality of higher costs in the future particularly medical expenses, 6) the negative economic effect of China becoming the low-cost manufacturer of the world, and 7) the essential need to take control of our own financial decisions and destiny.<br />What's interesting about this book is that all these co-factors are presented around the analogy of Noah's Ark, the ultimate story of preparation and anticipation. And while professional money people may scuff at this book's \\"average American\\" approach, it still focuses on theroots of financial problems, intelligent solutions, and timeless empowering beliefs.<br />While today's young investor may be looking for cutting-edge technology when I comes to investment advice, this book may be the better answer: street-smarts in a challenging, dynamic environment. I'll take the later any day!<br />I give this book a 5 star rating because it is a book whose time has come. This is the wake-up call for taking responsibility of our own lives by understanding the roots of future problems. Robert Kiyosaki has done a fabulous job in introducing and describing what could turn out to be the vital keys to either financial wealth or financial ruin. I hope that other will read this book and pass on its message to others.<br />It's also an enjoyable read!	2002-10-31

It's not a book about investing, but one about becoming aware of where we spend money, communicating about money with our family, developing empowering financial beliefs, where to find money in our lives, and how to attract more financial abundance.<br />Audrey Reed has done a fabulous job of making this complex subject (financial belief systems) fun and easy to understand.  She also gives practical, easy to follow advice on how to create new daily disciplines in order to get out of debt and enjoy a more stress-free money life.	2002-10-23

Here's a book that a truly sincere and mature man can appreciate.  While there are so many books written for women about love, there are very few good ones directed toward men.  <br />This one, however, is one of those gems.<br />What's great about this book is that it is very male, bottom-line friendly and therefore, speaks the language of its intended audience.  As a relationship author myself, I found this book a great help (and confirmation) in understanding what are the most key issues about men, women, and love.<br />Some of the things that I thought were very useful include:<br />*  \\"The Five Stages of Grief\\" and particularly the last stage called \\"acceptance.\\"  This is one that I overlooked in my life and is one of the most valuable to me personally.<br />*  \\"Inventing the New You\\" which is about moving forward by learning and growing.  The author selects some great books and tapes to help in the recovery phase.  I found that most people underrate the value of audio programs, but it is the live audio program format that first got me interested in  attending seminars and lectures which I feel have the greatest impact for creating lasting personal change.<br />*  \\"The Psychological Land Mines\\" which includes a look at what could be early signs of potentially damaging relationships.  I found this to be the most informative part of the book.<br />I could go on and on about the different features of the book, but the bottom line is that there is something for every man in this book.  For me personally, I think that I respect the author for his personal journey and his willingness to share his brilliant interpretation of how to intelligently go about creating a new love relationship the second time around.  <br />Here's a man who has felt the ultimate pain of a love one's death and has turned his life around to enjoy and contribute to another relationship in what seems like a relatively short time.<br />When you read this book, you'll come to appreciate that it comes straight from the heart.  There is nothing self-serving about Spouse Trap.  For men wanting straight talk about finding love and intimacy, here's a great book for you.	2002-08-15

I'm somewhat surprised by the negative reviews on this book.  Maybe it's not a perfect interpretation of the Art of War....so what.  Maybe there are not a lot of words or text.....you're probably right.  And maybe it's not worth [$$$] to some....it's the words on the paper, not the paper. <br />But for an active investor who doesn't need more information but needs to regain their discipline, adaptability, money management, and risk management skills, this can be a very good read.<br />I'm not one to blast other authors or think that there's a lot of money in writing books because it takes a lot of time and effort with little chance of reward to produce these books.  But  hostile reviewers can be a tremendous disservice.<br />In this case, this book deserves better.  You can argue with the packaging, but the message is clearly right on.  And in the area of investing and trading, this is what you truly want.<br />I happily spent the money and reread it every year.	2002-07-25

As a fellow relationship/self-help author I'm always curious what my colleagues are writing about in our unique genre of books. When I first saw this book I thought, \\"here's a book that the feminists are going to hate....a book about desperate women who have to have a man in order to feel happy and fulfilled.\\"<br />But I was wrong.<br />Here's a book that rightfully (surprisingly based on the book title...but remember not to judge a book by its cover!) teaches enlightened women to take care of themselves, enjoy their relationships, and live the life they've imagined whether it's with a man or not. It's about feminine empowerment and there's nothing that is more feminist than that.<br />As a guy I realize that this book has a certain \\"girlfriend-to-girlfriend\\" tone and humor to it. But after all nearly 80% of all self-help books are purchased by women. This book is one that almost all women I'm sure will enjoy and find funny at times.<br />The core of this book is the concept of the \\"Dream Girl.\\" Lisa Daily has made a major contribution in helping to redefine what a \\"Dream Girl\\" is not only for women, but for men as well. I guess she would say that it's about being a \\"kick-... chick\\" who's got it together and makes her life really happen in a lot of ways. And as a guy, I think she's right. More traditional guys like myself really want someone we respect, admire, adore, cherish, and value who is smart, sexy, funny, feminine, and in many ways, fearless.<br />I think women readers will find this book very inspirational in a modern \\"Sex and the City\\" kind of way. With the pointers in this book a women can have a fantastic job, spend a day each week helping out at a soup kitchen, have a sparkling clean apartment, have the right shoes for any occasion, and also attract the man of her dreams.<br />I'm happy to see that Lisa is teaching women to appreciate the \\"good guys\\" who do the traditional respectful things for those he loves and cherishes. We see eye-to-eye on most everything (although we say it in totally different voices and ways) and nowhere are we more aligned than the concept of intelligently separating the men from the boys.<br />For women in search of a great life as well as to attract a great guy as a husband for lifetime passion and intimacy, here's a truly enjoyable book that stands out in our relationship/self-help field. I give this book my highest rating with a big smile.	2002-07-17

I've been deeply involved with event planning as a professional florist, a seminar leader for Tony Robbins &amp; Dale Carnegie, and a tour guide for destination management companies.  So this book (3rd edition) comes in real handy for me.<br />The book is a collection of 11 easy to use charts, tables, diagrams, and lists that are essential for thorough planning of any event like a weddings, party, seminar, conference or ceremony.  While there isn't a lot of text, the book is pretty self-explanatory.<br />You could buy other books that have a lot written about what to do in this area, but here is a simple one that has all that you need to have a stress-free function within budget.<br />I think every professional florist, photographer, caterer, banquet manager, or full-service hotel should have a copy of this book on hand.  It is certainly money that is well-spent.	2002-07-12

As an author of a book that uses a fishing metaphor to illustrate how relationships work, I was approached by someone about this book.  So I bought it and must say that it truly gives the more serious angler a better understanding about what fly fishing for trout is all about.  Having read about a dozen books on trout fishing (in doing the research for my fishing analogy), I think this one is one of the very best.  The pictures are beautiful and something that every California trout fisherman should have in his personal library.	2002-07-11

As an author of a practical guide to dating and relationships, I was naturally skeptical about a reincarnation-karma type approach to love success.  This is not the kind of thing that a group of \\"Sex and the City\\" fans are going to identify with, is it?<br />But according to author, Stephen Petullo (a longtime, past life-regression therapist), the past affects the present (and future) and he backs this up with many case histories of how past life regression analysis can successfully improve a person's love life, whether they believe it or not.<br />Fortunately for me, my personal background as an NLP (neuro-linguistic programming....a secret skill mastered by motivational guru, Tony Robbins) trainer has already introduced me to this type of valuable mental technology.<br />For example, this book includes many scripts the reader can use on their own to go back in time and explore past lives for fun or to find out why they're still single, why they attract the wrong people, why their partners cheated on them, or for any other relationship issue.<br />One of the most interesting parts of the book was the \\"Love Cycles\\" section.  Here Petullo shows how to use simple numerology calculations, based on your date of birth, to determine what kind of events or situations to expect in your relationship or on what path to a successful one.  Numerology has been used and valued for centuries and can be used as a method of self-discovery and for foreseeing future trends/probabilities.<br />If you're ready to take another look at taking control of your love life, here's a book that I highly recommend.  This thorough metaphysical approach to love may be just the perceptional shift that you need in order to move closer to the love relationship you truly desire.	2002-07-11

At a time when the public is constantly getting slammed by hyped-up claims of how to become one-minute millionaires, it's refreshing to read a wise book like this.<br />I was a fan of Michael LeBoeuf's years ago when he wrote &quot;The Greatest Management Principle in the World&quot; which correctly stated that &quot;what gets rewarded gets done.&quot;  Since then a recently hyped book claims that &quot;what is fun gets done&quot; and we all are skeptical of that one, aren't we?<br />In this book, LeBoeuf writes a clear, enjoyable, and fundamentally-sound financial guide to wealth and happiness.  His background in management, finance, and time-management gives him the mature credibility that we all need for such important life-decisions.  Here is a man who is a financial-businessman first and an author second unlike so many others today.<br />I have a feeling that this book will not become a huge best-seller because of its somewhat understated manner.  But that should not take away from its incredible long-term value and excellent writing.<br />I think this is a 6 star book in a field where best-sellers are really 3 star books.  Buy this for yourself and anyone else you really care about.  (Especially those who have plenty of money and little time to enjoy it.)  <br />This book is a true financial treasure!	2002-06-14

As a professional tour director and author I am always on the lookout for good information to share with my clients.  When I took out a tour titled \\"A Week in Chicago\\" I needed a reference that would give me an insight to the city that guidebooks truly don't have.<br />This was the book that I luckily bought!<br />Here's 150 one or two page articles of the most defining moments in Chicago's history.  I shared the stories about Chicago Deep Dish Pizza, the Black Sox Scandal, Reversing the River, John Dillinger's Death, The Bi-level Commuter Train, and of course, the Great Fire.<br />I was able to give fresh accounts of these widely varied events to tourist on their first trip to Chicago.  These are the stories that mature people really want to know or remember.  And this book delivers 150 of them.<br />Whether you're a tourist or a resident, this a book to treasure if you really want to appreciate this great city.  It's a professional tour director's secret resource for Chicago.	2002-06-14

As an author and professional tour director I'm always on the lookout for insightful material to share with my travel clients.  This book was recommended to me by a bookstore in Las Vegas saying that this was the real history of the city.<br />I found this book to be more than a Bugsy Siegel or Godfather Part II interpretation of the past.  The cast of characters is far more reaching (Steve Wynn, Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton, the Kennedys, Howard Hughes, Senator Paul Laxalt, the Rat Pack, the Jewish underworld, etc.).<br />I particularly found the part about Joseph P. Kennedy to be interesting.  Here's a man that was head of the SEC and our Ambassador to Great Britain, yet a man who President Truman said is \\"As big a crook as we've got anywhere in this country.\\"<br />I would also recommend a book titled, \\"Double Cross\\" as one to read when it comes to understanding the Syndicate, the Kennedys, Hollywood, and Las Vegas.<br />This book gives you a deep understanding of how Las Vegas was created and helps make a trip to this city far more interesting and intriguing.	2002-06-12

I also contend that most of the mistakes in romantic relationships are started in the beginning stages.<br />Ms. Walsh also is very fair in assessing what it is that women have to do in order to attract and deserve love and I commend her on doing this.  At first glance, one might think that this book is all about what's wrong with men.<br />Her own story which she begins and ends her book with shows me a slight distortion of reality which has a lot to do with her being highly attractive, a well-known television personality, and a Beverly Hills-Hollywood-Santa Monica-Malibu lifestyle.  It makes for interesting reading, great stories, but may not really apply to the masses.<br />I recommend this book and think that readers will find value in this.  Just remember to journal in the questions and remember that Wendy wanted you to use them to \\"weed out the losers,\\" not jinx your love life by looking for faults.<br />If women take this book in its properly context (stage 1 evaluations), and keep their optimism fresh, it is a real gem.	2002-04-06

I read this book in order to back up some of the research that was needed for my own book.  Bobbie's 712 places to meet men really does a thorough job of stimulating the mind.  For instance, while I may have simply said to meet people at work, she has come up with a few dozen distinctions in this area.  The same goes for her section of the casino gambling meeting place.<br />I think that most of all women will realize that they can meet a man almost anywhere as long as she is sensitive to the situation, is warm and attractive, and makes herself approachable.<br />Add in a little bit of luck and persistence and you'll get your chance at love.<br />If not, as Bobbie writes....you may have to move.	2002-04-05

I've had a few weeks to let this book sink in and I must say that I'm very impressed with what these authors have written.  Basing a business approach on the Law of Attraction may seem a little new-agey to some hardened business people.  But a great gift of the New Age thinkers is the betterment of our society and living with integrity.<br />Being a former business owner (and present-day self-help author), I can really appreciate the concept of attracting the best customers and the best employees.  The recommended strategy of finding out what makes people tick, looking for room for improvement, finding out what others expect of you, and having more than one plan are clearly defined in the &quot;Strategic Attraction Process.&quot;<br />These authors understand another gift of New Age thinking and that is the concept of manifesting results.  That starts with ideas, thinking, attitudes, identities, standards and beliefs.  This foundation is thoroughly covered in the &quot;6 Standards of Strategic Synchonicity.&quot;<br />But my favorite part of the book is where they talk about the &quot;21 Daily Tips.&quot;  Here is a simple treasure chest of ideas for stimulating the attraction process.  Some enlightened goodies include:<br />*  Let your perfect customer know they are perfect<BR>*  Expect breakthroughs to look like breakdowns<BR>*  Share, share, and share yourself<BR>*  Break bread with a competitor<BR>*  Accept that you don't know<BR>*  Make irresistible improvements<br />I could go on and on about this book.  It all boils down to approaching business from a higher place and enjoying the benefits of giving your passion to the value you produce.<br />Becoming an enlightened business person is a great way to live your passion!  This book certainly helps in your quest.	2002-02-03

Michael Levine has put together cutting-edge techniques that he uses himself in his highly-respected PR firm (I'm on his emailing list even though I've only met him once very briefly). But this book has some excellent features that I particularly like such as: sample press releases, sample link proposals, detailed summaries at the end of each chapter, an appendix with media contact information, and a test at the end of the book.<br />This book has been handy for me as a small press author with a limited promotional budget and a really good website. I just completed an email campaign based on this book for Valentine's Day radio shows. This book would be worth it just for the \\"11 Levine's Lessons for Guerillas\\" and the \\"Portraits of a Guerilla\\" examples.<br />While there are other books on publicity and PR from small-time authors, agents and publicists, here's a complete piece of work from one of the big shots of PR.<br />If you have a website for commerce or are an author like me you've got to read this book.

These interviews capture the essence of the millionaire's mindset which is the basis for all consistent financial success.  These two guys understand what's going on in the field....by talking with experts and also getting some highly-specialized training in this area.<br />While it's high sales ranking can be directly attributed to the power of the Internet courtesy of Mr. Robert G.

What most people aren't aware of (as a student of Tony Robbins Wealth Mastery Course) is that the power of belief precedes all planning and action. So to the average person there may not appear to be enough advice on what to do. But the most leverage really comes from the financial mindset and the wealth blueprints.<br />The highlights of this book include: great quotations, clear charts and tables, and a thorough understanding of wealth unconsciousness (taught by Tony Robbins).<br />I guess Tony won't be writing a finance book because this one tells about all there needs to be said at this level (belief and planning).<br />For those who are looking for stock market advice (since the author is a stockbroker), his simple advice on buying the 10 highest yielding Dow stocks is really great. And if that's too much for investors to comprehend, then just buy an Index fund of the Dow (DIA). The key here is long-term passive investing in the highest-quality American companies. Active investing is a full-time job for pros.  Daytrading is for dummies.<br />There are too many gimmicky books on finance (too simple, for women only, Rich Dad's, etc.). This book is one of the truly great ones.	2002-01-12

As a relationship author from Los Angeles, I found this book to be a real eye-catcher. This book is beautifully designed from a book production point-of-view and is a handy guide for sexually curious people.<br />It seems like more of a guy's book, but there are lots of contributions from women in this fascinating collection of sexy ideas. While topless bars may not be of interest or value to most women and even some guys, I found the &quot;Rules of the Lap Dance: Do's &amp; don'ts from a private dancer&quot; to be a good read. There's also information of hotspots in not-to-far San Francisco, Las Vegas, Tijuana, and Palm Springs.<br />It's also like a restaurant guide or tour book except that the establishments serve up a different kind of menu. That menu includes strip clubs, porn shops, adult toy stores, lingerie shops, spas/massage parlors, some kinky history, porn star interviews, singles bars, escort services, late-night pick-up joints, stories of rock star groupies, celebrity clubs, nude beaches, happening hotels, and even places to &quot;make out.&quot; (Is this high school again?)<br />The publisher promises new editions for New York, San Francisco, Chicago, and Las Vegas in the near future. That New York edition should give new meaning to &quot;Sex and the City.&quot;<br />I give this a 5 star rating for the ideas it triggers and for the excellent formatting. But the real question is whether this information is really a benefit or just something interesting to read about.  As a travel-tour book it's price of $18.95 may be in line.  As something interesting to read, however, the price of the book is $4 too high.<br />In the meantime, this book should probably sell a ton regardless.	2002-01-11

Are we, the readers, such knuckleheads that we can't take in more than 100 pages of written text?<br />For those who want more management &quot;meat&quot;, here's an excellent collection of advice from a real pro with interesting examples.  I first heard Mark McCormack on the Tony Robbins' interview tapes and he came across as a very enlightened and sharp business man.  So I take his advice very seriously.  He also would not have been chosen by Mr. Robbins as his &quot;business expert&quot; for his interview series either.<br />This book which was title &quot;Staying Street Smart&quot; in its hardcover edition is filled with great ideas.  I particularly liked:  Beware the Small Defining Moments, Letting Go Is a Good Goal, Too, Pick Up the Pace with the Little Tasks, and the entire section entitled &quot;Etiquette For the New Millenium.&quot;<br />Of all the concepts that I found most useful for me was the &quot;What is the 'but...' about you? question.  (Like Steve is a good self-hellp author and reviewer, but he's too nice.)<br />I hope people will buy this book instead of the shallow stuff out today.  Mark McCormack is a businessman's businessman with vision, integrity, and street smarts.  He and this book give business a good name.<br />You can't go wrong with this one!!!	2002-01-08

This is my favorite &quot;Worst-Case&quot; book and probably the most practical.  I think it will make a great gift for the holidays.  It makes for interesting reading and is a conversational piece.  If you wanted to, I'm sure that you could read the whole book in a couple of hours.<br />Some of the advice is very practical, helpful and important for serious dating like:  How to Determine If Your Date is Married,  How to Deal with Bad Breath, How to Deal with a Drunken Date,  How to Survive If You Are Stopped by the Police, and How to Survive Snoring.<br />Others are mostly amusing (especially the diagrams!) like:  How to Determine the Gender of Your Date, How to Escape From a Bad Date, How to Spot a Fake (Boob job and hair pieces), How to Fend Off Competition For Your Date, and How to Remove Difficult Clothing...and of course the faking of the Big &quot;O&quot;.<br />Some things that are in the book may not be such a good idea in the first place like How to Have an Affair and Not Get Caught.  Maybe you can avoid the whole problem by not having an affair, right?<br />And the bit about How to Determine if Your Date is a Con-Artist...the entire thing about the eye patterns is such a bunch of neuro-baloney.  Trust your intuition and if he seems kind of weird then he probably is.<br />All in all this is a fun read, a great gift, a practical guide to a few situations that may apply to you or one of your friends, and if you live on the dating &quot;edge&quot;, this probably can save your behind....at least temporarily until you wise up. <br />Like a professional baseball player, this book helps an enlightened woman anticipate rare situations so that she can respond with action instead of react in panic.  And for this, we can be thankful that this book exists.<br />In today's pop culture society, I'm sure this is destined to be a National Best-Seller.	2001-12-22

Once you open up this book, you might as well forget trying to accomplish anything else for the next 90 minutes or so.  I know it will probably sell a lot of copies for the holidays and rightfully so.  We all hate to admit that we glance at the National Enquirer everytime we go to the supermarket or beauty salon, right?  But here in one place are some of the most shocking and memorable photos of our lives.<br />Unlike 30 years of People Magazine or Time Magazine, this volume has some of the bad taste that we come to expect out of the National Enquirer.  I would have bought this for my Mom except for the horrific coffin photos.  So this book may not be ideal for everyone. <br />On the other hand, I especially liked the pictures of celebrities before they were famous or when they were so young (and so were we!).  It goes to show how innocent all of us were not too long ago.<br />As far as coffee table books go, this one is a good and memorable one.  The beauty salons around the country should all get one!

They even do a great job of downplaying the Zen-spiritual part which can be a turn-off to business-minded people who are skeptical of the New Age approach to success.  This is one of those unique books that blends the New Age with the nitty-gritty of making big bucks and living your dream. <br />Tony Robbins says, \\"live with passion\\" and this book shows you how.  <br />This is simply a great book!...	2001-12-20

I expected more of an LA Story satirical comedy, but this gem of a book is a real delight.  As a guy in his mid-forties and a relationship author as well I am thoroughly amazed at how well Steve Martin is able to depict the inner thoughts of men confused by love. <br />My most memorable part read like this:  The topic so excites Lisa that she forgets all her careful posturing with Mirabelle and blurts out her deepest and darkest:  <br />&quot;When a man approaches me, I know exactly what he wants.  He wants to f... me.  And if I like him, I f... him a lot, until he gets addicted.  Then I cut him off.  That's when I've got him.&quot;<br />This is just a sample of Mr. Martin's great writing on Sex in this City....Hollywood, Beverly Hills, LA.  It's a place where a soul can drown in a sea of humanity which is so richly described in this wonderful book.<br />Treat yourself to this one!!!  Steve Martin is a remarkable individual.	2001-12-14

This is a beautifully formatted book on the tough subject of promotion and publicity for self-publishers.  It covers all the bases with no real emphasis on any area because the area of eventual success for each self-publisher will probably vary.  Marilyn and Tom Ross are the founders of the SPAN network and definitely know their subject.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is or is considering the self-publishing road.  Along with Dan Poynter's books, this is one to have in your publishing library.  But my personal opinion here (and the Rosses wouldn't dare say it) is that in today's competitive environment, self-publishing is more likely to result in lost money rather than new fortunes.  Thus, it is very important that the new self-publisher knows what's a potential waste of time and what has any financial payoff.  And some of the areas covered in this book may very easily lead to nowhere.  All self-publishers beware:  it's really tough to make any money here.  For most, it's, like it or not, a non-profit business.	2001-12-08

What makes this book special is that it was the first book written in this size and format.  I know for a fact that the whole &quot;Don't Sweat the Small Stuff&quot; series was patterned after this book.

Amongst men, they will say, &quot;Chicks aren't funny.&quot;  Well, here's a book that a lot of women will buy for the humor, but a good portion of the advice could be very helpful.  This is one of the books that I used as a resource for my book.  I believe that the biggest problem that most women have in dating is &quot;spooking&quot; men away early.  And here's a book that tells women in a woman's voice what might trigger this.  I particularly find things like #19 &quot;Use baby talk in bed, #41 &quot;Have a prejudice, #55 Talk about therapy, #69 &quot;Overdress&quot;, and #89 &quot;Don't laugh at his jokes,&quot; to be very good examples of &quot;spooking.&quot;  I think it's a fun read that would make for a good woman-to-woman joke, but there's real good relationship advice in here, but not properly contextualized.  Bottom line:  men get spooked easily....you only get a few chances at the big one.	2001-12-06

I really enjoyed this book about such a legendary player...a man who was truly ahead of his time.  The story of his life and his relationship with his father adds such richness to our understanding of such a unique and innovative basketball phenomenon.  His story (and his Dad's) takes us through the history of basketball up to the Jordan era.  And while today's game may be bringing in more money and creating more millionaires I feel fortunate to be one of those who misses and cherishes the previous era.  Pete Maravich was and still is the most fascinating ballhandler of all-time.  He had to create all this without any role models which is mindboggling in itself.  I hope that more people get a chance to read and enjoy this book.  The author did a fabulous job of writing and the title is so appropriate.....Pete Maravich will be forever showtime.	2001-12-04

I just came back from a 7 island (San Juan, St. Thomas, Tortola, Dominica, Martinique, Barbados, St. Kitts on Carnival) cruise of the Caribbean and I found this book to be the most practical guide of the 3 that I took with me.  The maps are good and the advice on beaches was helpful.  This is a book that you can take onshore with you in your backpack.  It serves as a good intro, but of course you'll have to find other sources for more in-depth coverage of culture and history.  What I found to be a huge surprise on my cruise was that almost all of the excursions that were offered by the ship were available as you got off the dock from private suppliers for a good 30% off the cruise price.  The risk is very small and after a few ports almost everyone that I talked to went on their own privately arranged tours instead.	2001-12-04

I was only a casual fan of the Beach Boys...more of a Beatle, Byrd, CSN, Eagles-type musically, but as of late have become very appreciative of the middle era of the Beach Boys.  I picked up this book because I like the &quot;Real Beach Boy&quot; title and because a friend of mine had meet Dennis one year while skiing up in Utah and said what a nice guy he was.  Of all the Beach Boys, Dennis was the most colorful and the one who would make for the most interesting story.  The author did a fabulous job making this such an enjoyable and well-researched read.  I wish there was a way to hear some of the music that Dennis recorded, but I don't think they are on CD.  Anyways, if you are a fan of surfing, music, or the California sound, then this is a book worth reading.  The Beatle and the Stones got so much more adultation, when here underneath our noses in Southern California was a band (especially creatively) that was a near equal.	2001-11-28

As a relationship author myself I'm always on the lookout for fresh material or perspective on men-women issues.  I brought this book with me last week on my vacation to Cabo San Lucas.  At home I would have found this book to be entertaining and at times partially correct, but in a vacation resort (or a city like Las Vegas) this stuff can be amazingly true.  For all those women who have reviewed this book and have given such low ratings, I'm afraid that you're probably the ones who need to be aware of this the most.  If you can get past the obvious outrageousness (for entertainment) and annoying page layouts, there's more truth than you can imagine.  If this is too strong for your tastes, then take a look around and notice all the strip clubs that are around the big cities.  As far as I can see amongst my wide range of friends, the things in this book like (prostitutes, Deny, Business trips, masturbation, and the clever test at the end) are either in the thought process or actually being played out by a significant number of men.  Those who are not would be those who are very spiritually evolved (and see no fulfillment in this direction) or are pansies.  If your guy is a take charge, macho, guy's guy, then don't be surprised if either he or his friends are like this book.  There's more truth in here then almost any woman could believe.  In many cases, it is more a matter of finding out what stage the guy is in.  But the authors are right in that there are definitely &quot;some&quot; things in here that us guys don't want women to know....and if you're a woman don't pass up on this kind of candid understanding.  It probably won't be repeated a whole lot more in mainstream published books.	2001-11-28

The stories in this book are very entertaining like gambling stories.  What I like most is the frank discussion of methodology...tactics that Buzzy shares....so similar to my own approach.

I've had the fortune of hearing Marcia Weider speak in person and by the way, she is a dynamic speaker, I think that her book here is a pleasant surprise.  Readers will enjoy her use of diagrams, charts, lists and all the things that an experienced seminar leader needs in order to illustrate such an abstract concept.

I've heard Mr. Trout speak before and I found him to be very right on.  This is a book that cuts to the chase and is an anti-BS book.  I particularly found the chapter on Self-Improvement to be insightful.  His comments about Tony Robbins make for an interesting perspective especially from a manager's point of view.  If you're a fan of self-improvement, be sure to read this chapter.  It will help ground you and prevent you from getting too carried away with the seminar business.

This book offers the business person another way to approach success.  While I think there is a much deeper value in fishing as it relates to life, this book is more on the surface.  But like a lot of analogies where you try to bring together dissimilar things into one, there are many mental stretches when it comes to business. And some don't fly so well. This is a book more for bass fishermen than say flyfishermen which I believe is the purest essence of the sport.

I've read all the other CSNY books and this one really has the scoop plus there is a tremendous amount of content in this long narrative.  One of the things that I enjoyed most about the music of this era were the characters involved.  This is the band that spawned Stephen Stills, Neil Young, CSN, CSNY, Loggins &amp; Messina, Poco, (in a way, the Eagles).  This was the best of folk rock and yet Buffalo Springfield was largely a disappointment.  This band played at my high school for an after-school assembly and what I remember was that the PA system went out.  This book recalls that moment.

I'm not a girl, but I am an author in the relationship genre so I used this book as a reference (finding movies as a way of illustrating points).  This is a clever study...and I think as a man, very opinionated.  It's written by women for women and the humor is something that us men don't find particularly funny.  But the truth is it's not written for us guys.  I think women will find this interesting and will help point out obscure movies to rent for quiet evenings.

While it is only a quotation book, it can really be a delight for the thoughtful person who likes to go fishing.  The quotations from Emerson, Thoreau, Shakespeare, Disraeli, Keller and the like are indicative of the value of fishing as a metaphor for life.

Here's a book for the businessman and investor who wants to see the big picture.  The S-curve concept is something that is easy to understand and probably serves as a good model for how things will shape out in terms of population, spending and investments.  Like all models I'd be very careful with these projections and while I like reading about all of Harry's stuff, it's a little dangerous to fall in love with these scenarios.  After all nobody really knows about the future.  I do think that the whole concept of the exurbs and real estate investing is particularly interesting especially for someone like myself who travels extensively.  This all ties in with the Internet Age, the New Network Corporation, and the spending wave.  I'd highly recommend this book for its enjoyment and it possibilities, but I'd really caution against the certainty of the scenarios.

If your strategy is too far removed from this book, then you're probably taking on far more risk than you should.  I think that a lot more should have been written about wills and trusts for estate planning.  That's an area that would have only taken another 10 pages, but would have completed the works and is something that everyone over 50 with bucks needs to know well.	2001-11-20

Here's a book that had a great influence on motivational guru, Tony Robbins. There are very few profound works amongst business books today, but here's a book that all people in sales should have in their personal library. (...) The factors of unconscious influence will always be the same.....timeless information. I highly recommend this book....it's also a rare good read, too.	2001-11-20

I recently had to do some cramming for an estate planning session with our family attorney and this book was my reference for understanding wills, trusts, insurance, and IRA plans.  Even though I have a degree in Finance, it helps to have this subject explained and diagrammed in an easy to understand formula.  I think Mr. Edelman did a great job with this work.  The charts and diagrams are outstanding.  If you're going to do any estate planning, start by reading this gem.	2001-11-20

While the stories are somewhat outdated, I think this book stands up well even today.  I look forward to any new works by Mr. Robbins.  It's very surprising to me that this work and Unlimited Power are his only real original books written to date (the others are take-offs).  Any new reader should own both and perhaps an audio program as well.	2001-11-20

I bought this book when the group did their 2000 Reunion Tour and thoroughly enjoyed both. Looking back, I'd say that I liked the book in the same way that I liked the group....the early days and the early struggles were the best.<br />What we forget about these guys was that their most productive years were from about 1968 to 1974 as a group and as individuals. All the years after this time, they have been only a shadow of themselves. If you like this book and are more of a Stills fan, be sure to read Richie Furay's book, For What It's Worth which is even more personal and detailed about the early days.<br />As a CSN fan, I'll always treasure those first two albums as a couple of my all-time favorites. I would hope that there is a live album from the last tour. <br />I also wish that someone would help Stills write a book, too. I'd love to hear his version of all that happened.	2001-05-28

I like how this book shows the wide variety of relationship situations in this interesting subculture of America. Even though a lot of things are similar to what I can experience in my hometown of Los Angeles, the social lifestyle of New York is much more intense, complex, and, as a result, difficult environment for love. As an author of a relationship/self-help book, I found this book to be fresh take on a lot of side-issues that come up in romances particularly for those men who are successful and the women who have lost their innocence and optimism. Love and life in the fast lane may be colorful and exciting, but it does little to create the sacred spiritual connection that is the natural environment for making love happen.<br />For those who are interested in reading this book, it's less funny and darker than the television show. But there is plenty of entertainment, love lessons, and good writing here. But I think that most people will find the book to be disappointing. The writers on the television show are better! You also have to tip your hat to the wonderful cast members who are all fabulous.	2001-05-28

This is a fabulous book which I hope is not taken too lightly.

But the most profound changes in people are created on the core belief level. Here's a book that addresses this level in a simple, truthful way.<br />I hope that Mr. Robbins gets wind of this book (maybe he has) because his type of deep-level unconscious training must never deviate or contradict the principles derived from these \\"four agreements.\\"<br />For those of you who are not familiar with Tony Robbins let's just say that he's a very influencial person who does large-audience seminars designed to change people's lives.<br />But anyone can change their lives for the better (quickly and economically) by making a serious study of this book.<br />The value of \\"The Four Agreements\\" greatly exceeds the cost.

I say this tongue-in-cheek because I see how well this book is selling with the brokerage houses who have only one objective which is to generate commissions. I get flyers periodically for George Gilder's investment newsletter, so there's a big push to promote what he has to say. I decided to buy this book, read it and let it sink for a few weeks. In many ways this book is a little over my techical head but I like the fact that he distills his investment choices in the back of the book to the \\"Nine Stars of the Telecosm.\\" I'll use his list and sort them out by more traditional valuation models to arrive at the best investment choices. My 4 star rating is in terms of its reading value (fun, interest, and information) for the average investment-oriented reader. It's probably a 5 star for George Gilder fans, a 1 star for tech geniuses, a 1 star for literary critics, a 5 star for stockbrokers, but again more like a 4 star for average investment readers.	2000-12-06

I was first introduced to Warren Farrell when he was a featured speaker at a Tony Robbins NLP Certification seminar in 1989. The bulk of his presentation then is in this book which I think was just as powerful as John Gray's Mars-Venus material. Why Men Are the Way They Are is because Women Are the Way They Are which is the result of cultural conditioning by advertising and tradition. His examples are truly excellent and this book was one of my foundational resource..., but to those who seek innovative works in the relationship genre this is a classic gem.	2000-12-06

My slight downgrade is because I come the investor's side of what George Gilder has to say. While this book is only 2 years old, it's value as an investment book has been decreased by time. I would have liked a little more on Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, Scott McNealey, Steve Jobs and all the characters who are the cutting-edge of the high-tech business. Since George Gilder did not write this book or even add a comment to the Introduction, he can't be blamed in any way. The editor's choice of material is spread a little longer and thinner than I'd like. Maybe 4 1/2 stars is a better all-around rating, but for the investor only a 4 I'm sorry to say. Things just happen too fast.	2000-12-06

For attractive young women looking to &quot;catch&quot; a young, successful, professional, semi-decent looking guy, this is your book.  The 3 authors pooled their insights and share a 30 year old male perspective on commitment, living together, getting engaged and the like.  Their strength is telling about their world, but it's a world that not everyone lives in.  I think they have a pretty good handle on &quot;hooking&quot; a guy emotionally and physically....being careful not to scare him away, but there is a spiritual quality of love that is being missed.  That type of understanding would not be expected from these guys based their age and background.  But hey, it's a decent read, great title and I'm sure they'll sell a lot of books.  But I hope they did not assume that this was a book for meant for non-Yuppies because it's not.  And if that was the case, I'd have to lower my rating.	2000-12-04

A new writer could spend a small fortune buying all the books of &quot;How to Get Published&quot; but here's a book that I think belongs in every writer's library. Of all of Dan's books, this is the one I recommend most to other writers. It also serves as a good model in itself.

For me, I enjoyed the simple layout and refined thinking that went into reducing her tons of research into 8 truths. You've got to respect her street-smarts. I also appreciated her extensive recommended books and web sites info. While this book may not be as ground-breaking as the first book, The Popcorn Report, it is still vital information from one of today's most brilliant marketing minds. Ignor the bad reviews.

This book reveals Enberg's tasteful choice of humor in a full volume collection that is certainly worth the price of admission.
