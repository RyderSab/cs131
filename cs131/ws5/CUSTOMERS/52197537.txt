Baker's \\"Whales & Dolphins of New Zealand and Australia: An Identification Guide\\". The cetacean species accounts are brief, one-page summaries with limited information. Artist renderings of the animal are used instead of photos. In addition to species accounts, quite a bit of general information about evolution, reproduction, communication, behavior, strandings etc. make up more of the book than the species accounts. If I'd seen this on a book shelf, I would probably pass it up. I'd never pay $100+ for a copy (shrug).	2004-08-25

Although this book does not document the sighting info I was looking for, it's full of quite a bit more useful information than I expected! 30+ pages of taxonomy, whaling info, natural history notes and first aid for stranded marine mammals is followed by identification sections. A two page chart showing blowing/surfacing characteristics of some of the larger whales (including all rorquals) is particularly useful, as is a 2 page key to toothed whales using teeth. The information on Ziphiid whale tooth placement is summarized well. This is followed by a species directory, divided into large whale, medium-sized whale, and smaller whale/dolphin sections. This is further divided into sections by morphological similarity (e.g. large whale with dorsal fin/without dorsal fin). All similar species are pictured together with outline drawings of head, and text summaries of key characters. Lastly, the species accounts include further information, including photos of stranded animals from the area. All in all, this is a useful addition to my cetacean reference shelf. The taxonomy is a bit dated, and some of the Ziphiid stranding information has been outdated by DNA testing of museum specimens. But most students of this group will already know this.	2004-08-20

I've not been very political in the past (recent events based on the hijacking of the Presidency by the Supreme Court changed all that) and am not a big student of politics (I'm a research scientist....and a woman to boot). But now I'm 3/4 of the way through this book and can't put it down. I'd put myself on the hold list at the local library and got one of the first copies in circulation. Now, I'm buying one for myself, one for my mother and one for my sister. Hillary is an inspiration to all women who aspire to make a difference. I do admit that I'm surpised by the negative comments made by others in this forum. It's so obvious to me that their agenda has nothing at all to do with this book.

However, I've gotten more and more irritated with her obsessive negativity about anyone weighing more than 150 lbs and her cartoonish characters. One line in this book about how awful shorts look on anyone weighing more than 150 lbs was particularly grating. Harumpf! It's interesting to read her summarization of Malamutes as well and how she excuses their worst behaviors (dog-dog aggression etc). It's even more amusing to those of us who have chosen a 'better' breed (hey, it's all relative!). Whatever....after this book, I'm not bothering to read any more of her books as Conant's style becomes very annoying with time. Harumpf again....	2003-06-05

I thought it would be interesting to read about John Steinbeck through the eyes of a son. However, the is very very little in this book about John Steinbeck and way too much about a weak-minded son. Boring. If you are interested in reading about someone who spends his life trying to find meaning in life via others (ie. cult life) and who cannot find strength within himself....who is too weak to deal with life without chemicals....this may be interesting to you.

However, for those who have spent some time sharing their lives with dogs, there isn't anything new here. I would probably have rated this book 5 stars back when I was a junior in high school trying to understand my first dog (who was luckily VERY forgiving of my mistakes). But 30+ years later, after studying many of the same reference materials myself during my own wildlife ethology studies, I would rate this book 3 stars. It helped me reinforce what I already knew and gave me some new references I'd overlooked (I've already ordered Alan Beck's 'The Ecology of Stray Dogs'). But this book is not an essential for my own dog behavior/training bookshelf. One amusing feature is the authors constant reference to herself as a Applied Animal Behaviorist (with capitols, no less). You can expect this reminder to readers of her 'real credentials' in each chapter.	2003-03-26

Clever dialogue. Characterization that may be a bit over the top, but amusing.

However, for those who have worked with Sebastes in the Pacific for 20+ years, it soon becomes obvious that much is lacking. Great gaps yawn throughout. The reference information is sorely lacking in completeness and much of the recent research over the past 10 years is missing. This could have been something great. It still is a nice starting place for those interested in the genera Sebastes and Sebastolobus. But, after passing my new copy through the lab today, the concensus is that it is a pretty book lacking scientific integrity and completeness. Mary Yoklavich does add credibility by her involvement, but, well....for those who find joy in juvenile humor, you'll find some here. A scientific reference it's NOT. Sigh.	2002-09-27

The author fails to take into consideration the differences between active and passive defense reflex dogs. At the time, a number of dog trainers in our area were focused on this approach to training. In class, I was required to reposition my dog physically rather than using vocal cues to correct his behavior (the Bauman approach). This absolutely does NOT work with an active defense reflex dog! You can't imagine the problems this approach to training caused for my dog. I later found William Campbell's book, figured out a proper approach to training my dog, and consequently put a CD on him. The 'Bauman' trainers had told me I'd never succeed, but they lacked the insight into dog behavior to problem solve outside their 'box'.	2002-02-01

I got much more useful information from William Campbell's 'Behavior Problems in Dogs', Patricia Gail Burnham's 'Play Training your dog' and 'On Talking Terms With Dogs : Calming Signals'by Turid Rugaas.

Poor editing (numerous misspellings) and bad information here and there result in a 4 star rating rather than a 5. For example, the author 'tried out' Siberian Huskies at one point and even produced a mixed breed litter (gasp), but some of her assumptions were patently untrue. For example, the author claims that &quot;Siberian huskies (sic) were the last canine breed to be domesticated&quot;. In fact, the Siberian Husky originated over 2000 years ago with the Siberian Chukchi tribe (see Demidoff/Jennings &quot;The Complete Siberian Husky&quot;).  The author dabbles in various wild critter commitments:Tursiops in Florida, belugas in Tacoma and eastern Canada, wolves across the US, humpback whales and spinner dolphins in Hawaii but I kept wondering how much more she could have understood if she had taken the path of biology rather than journalism. She claims to have taken up the mantle of wild critter advocacy but to be honest, I think she falls into the category of 'talk is cheap'-type advocacy. But then, we have real biologists like Ken Balcomb to fight against Navy sonar experiments etc.  All in all, an interesting read....but remember the salt shaker (take with a grain of salt).	2001-05-24

Artistic renderings are often beautiful, but fail to portray the animal in question with accuracy. Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius)is a case in point. Although I have not observed this animal at sea myself, I spoke with a number of fellow fishery biologists who have spent time at sea as marine mammal observers and no one has ever observed a bright yellow Ziphius in the field. All observed a base color of grey with this genus, at least in the northeastern Pacific. The Tasmacetus rendering is most likely based on the J. Mammalogy (1976) paper by Watkins wherein an unidentified ziphiid whale (probable Tasmacetus) was observed from a bluff overlooking the sea in New Zealand. Useful plates were those showing all similar cetaceans together; eg. all oceanic dolphins without prominent beaks, all oceanic dolphins WITH prominent beaks etc. The ziphidae plates show male Mesoplodon characteristics, but that is to be expected since solitary female ziphiid whales, especially Mesoplodon sp., could be virtually impossible to identify.  My own field guide preferences use photographs rather than artistic renderings. Other problems: The distribution maps to not reflect the full distribution (extralimital observations/strandings) of many species. An example: Psuedorca is shown as a species with a distribution much further south than observations/stranding records indicate. The text does suggest that 'numerous records' exist outside of the more tropical distribution shown in the map. Note also that many of the dolphin renderings are positioned so that the dorsal fin is right where the pages meet. We did get a chuckle over the photograph showing what you should wear when watching whales, but that can be explained by our 'silly scientist' bias. One note for potential whale-watchers: do not allow your binocular strap to lie right on the skin of your neck while at sea as you can wear painful wounds into your neck through a day of whale-watching. Make sure your shirt collar or other clothing lies under that silly strap! Voice of experience!whale-watching. Make sure your shirt collar or other clothing lies under that silly strap!

Numerous black-and-white photos show all important field characteristics. Detailed analysis of the field characteristics separating the various large Balaenopterids is especially useful. Species which have been recorded as accidental are also included. Updating information about the presence of Hyperoodon (or Indopacetus??) in Pacific waters near the equator would be useful, although photos of 'unidentified' Ziphidae are included. This is the only book I take out with me for field cruises.	2001-02-07

Although user-friendly, this is an incomplete field guide. A number of whale/dolphin genera/species which occur in Alaskan waters are excluded. Although missing from this field guide, I have personally observed northern right whale dolphin and short-finned pilot whales in the Gulf of Alaska during research cruises. Risso's dolphin and false killer whale have been recorded from Alaskan waters and are also excluded from this book. A number of other ceteceans (especially Kogia spp, Stenella coeruleoalba, and several other Mesoplodon spp. especially M. carlhubsii) are potential accidentals in Alaskan waters during warm-water incursions and these are also ignored. Please consider purchase of a complete guide to cetacean identification instead. Try Leatherwood et al.'s \\"Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises of the Eastern North Pacific and Adjacent Arctic Waters'.	2001-02-07

I grab this book quite frequently when refreshing my mind on the distribution and distinguishing characteristics of a cetacean outside my field of expertise. For those interested in even more meaty fare, pick up Richard Ellis' 'The Book of Whales' and 'Dolphins and Porpoises'. Both books are must have additions to the serious cetologist's book shelf. My field guide of choice for North Pacific field study: Leatherwood et. al. 'Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises of the Eastern North Pacific and Adjacent Arctic Waters: A guide to their Identification'.	2001-02-07

I suppose this may be construed by some as evidence of a great author....who has IMPACT on his audience. I did enjoy this book until near the end, where everything falls apart and violence takes over. I'm sorry...if I'd KNOWN about the utter chaos of the ending, I'd not have ever started. Some may enjoy books which make them feel ILL at the end....I do not.	2001-01-11

I'm impressed with her ability to build characterizations, to use English in an entertaining, engrossing manner, and her story-telling gift matches that of the masters. This is NOT a light romance novel as suggested by other reviewers (I'd never have finished it if that were the case), but has a depth, a flow and a magic that grabs you. I was not able to put this book down until I finished! AND, I am NOT easily impressed by new authors! Try it!	2001-01-11

I bought this book because I wanted help working with Netscape Composer. The reviews indicate that this book focuses on this shortware. Unfortunately, the Second Edition (1999) does mentions Netscape Composer twice and includes ONE page discussing Composer. The rest of the book deals with use of FrontPage Express. I'll be returning this disappointment.	2001-01-09

Same thing bugged me in Russell Drumm's 'In the Slick of the Cricket' when he misspelled otolith (fish do NOT have otaliths!). 'Breakers' explores the pervasive nature of our relationship with Japanese fish market buyers and their financing of American fisheries. I'm very interested to explore this dynamic myself in the 'real world' as I hadn't really paid much attention to the changeover from joint-venture and foreign fisheries to domestic catch. I did not find 'Breakers' to be as enthralling as 'Highliners', hence the lower rating.	2000-12-18

The premise was fascinating and the story moved well without extraneous 'stuff'....I couldn't put the book down and read it in a weekend. It went on the 'keeper' pile, which I can't really say for most of the book I pick up based on 'excellent' Amazon.com reviews. If you enjoy thinking about ancestral humans and the possibility that a pocket of our genetic ancestors CAN still exist in an isolated African location, try this book! I certainly wasn't disappointed.	2000-11-20

I'm quite surprised by the number of negative reviews of this book, but I quite frankly found it very interesting. Jane, who is recently divorced, goes on a trip to the Galapagos where she finds that the tour guide is her distant cousin/estranged best friend from childhood. What follows is a convoluted tale of relationships, the evolution of friendship, species and families. For those who have developed a blind-sided aversion to Darwin and the theory of evolution, this is probably too much to take, but for those who enjoy the process of scientific thought and analysis and spoofs thereof, this book is a treat. But then, as a scientist by choice and vocation, I'm probably biased (grin).	2000-09-21

Yes, I knew it was written by  the granddaughter of the Ernest Hemingway and yes, I know it was about  'fishing'....but I really had no idea. Really..no idea how this woman's  words would grab me. Knowing that she lives in the same city where I work,  I'm hoping to one day stumble across her and just tell her how much impact  this book had on me. A co-worker just went through alcohol de-tox and this  book gave me some vague notion of what he went through. Thanks for that!  I'm not a fisherwoman....but I love fish and I work with dead fish parts  daily as a science-lady, and this book is full of fish-wisdom, honesty and  beautiful, true words. This book is full of all that. Humor, honesty and  love. Again, WOW!	2000-09-17

William Campbell's  book was the only reference which addressed the issues I needed to  understand. Campbell's description of 'active defense reflex' vs 'passive  defense reflex' dogs made all the difference in my understanding of  Shasta's behavior. He gave me all the advice I needed to turn this behavior  around with very specific instructions which worked to perfection.  We went  on, after reading this book, to earn a CD in obedience whereas before I  could not even touch his body without being bitten ('active defense  reflex'). I recommend this book to anyone I contact who is dealing with dog  behavior problems and I'm very interested to see how this new edition  compares to the one I purchased in the 1970's!	2000-08-02

Simplistic vocabulary....soap opera fodder....but I was pulled through the whole  course with interest in seeing what happens to the main characters. Nothing  mind bending here and your intellect can remain in doze-mode....this is  something I could have read in third grade (when I was reading Kon Tiki and  Big Red).	2000-08-01

Anyone wishing to find the source of a given image used will be frustrated.  Although there is a listing of stamp companies with a summary of the pages  showing their images, it's impossible to determine which company provided  which image on a given page showing multiple stamps. FRUSTRATING. The  techniques illustrated are mostly old, well-known processes which any paper  artist well versed in the current 'stuff' will be familiar with and many of  the tricks to success with these techniques are omitted. A cursory summary  at best for most techniques with sketchy documentation. I did get a couple  new ideas but could easily have passed on this book if I'd seen a copy  before ordering. I highly recommend that those interested in this type of  paper arts book consider the three marvelous books by Mary Jo McGraw  instead.	2000-06-22

I'm usually quite disappointed in 'general' cetacean literature but this book surprised me. Very well done! Although I'm not an expert in freshwater dolphin biology, small North Pacific Odontocetes were the topic of my own  MS thesis so I approach these works from a biased perspective. Loaded with  marvelous black-and-white photos and sections of color photographs. I've  already got this book out on loan to some of my fellow biologists down the  hall at the National Marine Mammal Laboratory.	2000-06-20

This one is another winnder. Nine chapters cover a number of techniques including paper mosaic with a double-sided tape base, Diamond Glaze 'glazing' on acetate, an image  transfer technique using color photocopies and self-adhesive laminate or  acetate and shrink plastic tricks &amp; techniques. As usual, Mary Jo's  samples are marvelous and each technique is illustrated with step-by-step  photos. I HIGHLY recommend this book as well as all of Mary Jo's paper arts  books. .	2000-06-20

In that case, you will be much better served by considering Bethmann's &quot;Nature Printing with Herbs, Fruits &amp;  Flowers&quot; which has a small gyotaku section. If you are looking for  examples of artistic presentation of gyotaku prints, this book provides 53  color plates of fish prints done by the author.

Something to 'accessorize' Cover-to-Cover  (the supreme bookmaker's book!). This book does a good job of making the  craft of book making accessible to children.....so I'll be sharing this  with my artistic nephew instead. I could see this also as being useful to a  teacher in the lower grades....but it doesn't discuss anything new and  exciting for those already immersed in bookmaking.	1999-11-09
