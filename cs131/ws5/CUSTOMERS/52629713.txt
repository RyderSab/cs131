There she comes across Jesse Tuck, who tells her that he is 104 years old. Soon thereafter, Jesse and his brother, Miles, and his mother, Mae, take Winnie to their farm and tell her an amazing story about a spring in the wood. The waters of this spring, when drunk, will make a person stop aging forever. But someone else also hears the story, and he has sinister motivations for finding the spring for himself.<br /><br />This is a great story. It is well-told and definitely gives the reader a lot to ponder. The Tuck family is doomed to walk the earth forever, unable to die or change or get older, watching as friends and family grow old and die. \\"Eternal youth\\" may not be all it's cracked up to be. Winnie is given the chance to drink the water and have this eternal youth, but you don't find out until the end if she grasps that opportunity.	2005-09-19

It is true that the story of Gilbert Bland's map thefts from numerous universities is the basis for the book. But while Bland's story pops up now and again throughout the book, the real meat of the story is the world of antique maps. Personally, I find maps quite interesting. But for people who aren't particularly interested in maps, this book will bore you. Harvey explores the fascinating culture of antique maps, dealers, map shows, and auctions. He also looks at some map history, explaining how important maps were during the age of exploration because the country with the accurate maps was usually the country with the edge on trade and exploration. Harvey also delves a little into security issues, considering just how many maps Bland stole from libraries all over North America before finally being detected. There's a lesson here for libraries. Of course, all these elements are woven in with the story of Gilbert Bland. <br /> <br />The one bad part about this book was Harvey's attempt to show the reader just how connected he was with the story and his investigation of Bland. Harvey makes constant parallels between his journey and that of Bland's, making loose connections between his obsession with the story and the obsession of map collectors. It felt like a high school student eager to show off his ability to make tenuous connections between various plot threads in an English literature essay.  <br /> <br />Really, I would give this book 3.5 stars. It's interesting, and much of the story is well-told, but some of it is not.	2005-09-13

Wanting a quieter life, she leaves Salmon Arm, in British Columbia's Okanagan region. She sets up her new life some 700 miles to the northwest, in the remote Coast Mountains of South Tweedsmuir Provincial Park. Her only neighbors are Jack and Trudy Turner who have a homestead across the river from her.  <br /> <br />This book chronicles Chris' experiences in setting up a new life south of Lonesome Lake, along the Atnarko River (the \\"singing river\\" in the title refers to the musical sound of the water, not the name of the river itself). It takes a day (sometimes two) to hike to Highway 20, so she's almost entirely on her own when it comes to building her cabin. The Turners help when they can, but when the chainsaw breaks down or new materials are required, a hike out to civilization is often required. The story of the 18-month project of building the cabin is interspersed with tales of life in the wilderness. She tells of the rhythms of the seasons, the wildlife she encounters, and the explorations she undertakes to familiarize herself with the surrounding area. Her descriptions enable the reader to see the gorgeous British Columbia scenery as if they were there themselves. <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Many of us have, at some time or another, dreamed of living off the land, away from civilization. This book allows you to do that vicariously through Chris' experience and also makes you realize just how hard it is!	2005-09-06

And I loved that the author didn't shy away from difficult situations. None of the characters in this book live an easy life, especially the main character, Novalee. They all have some sort of hardship at one point or another, sometimes often. But what's great about this book is that the characters overcome anything bad that happens to them. They take strength from their friends and persevere. So instead of being a downer, this book is actually pretty uplifiting. It gives you hope that bad times will pass and your friends will always be there to support you.	2005-09-03

Too much of the book was focused on the long and drawn-out suspensful parts and chase scenes. While there are plenty of suspenseful moments in Hard Truth, and the obligatory escaping-the-bad-guy scene, there is still substantial plot development in other parts of the novel.  <br /> <br />When two missing pre-teens in Rocky National Park finally turn up alive, Anna finds that she has an unusual \\"sidekick\\" in Heath Jarrod, a stubborn and wheelchair-bound paraplegic. As the two women try to figure out where the girls - who aren't talking - have been during the previous weeks, and where their still-missing friend might be, Anna and Heath form an alliance to fight the bad guys. If only they knew who the bad guys were. As in every Anna Pigeon novel, the suspect is not who it seems at first, though if you've read enough of Barr's books, you can figure out who it is about halfway through the book once you've gotten to know the characters better. Of course, Anna doesn't figure it out until the last 100 pages.  <br /> <br />While this book did a better job of weaving a plot instead of just spinning one suspense scene after another, I found it to be too dark and sinister. Anna Pigeon books should stick to adult mysteries. Evil things happening to adults is bad enough, but once kids are involved, it becomes more sickening, and that was the case with this book. Bad things befalling children is just too dark and gruesome for national park mysteries involving our beloved Ranger Pigeon. In addition, the animal cruelty was too much. There are at least three animal cruelty scenes and though they're brief, they are nonetheless heart-breaking. <br /> <br />Like other readers, I miss Molly. In the early books, I loved the conversations that Anna and Molly had on the phone. A phone conversation with Molly is mentioned in Hard Truth, but we aren't given the dialogue that takes place. Considering the truly weird psychological stuff going on with some of the characters in this book, a conversation or two with Molly would have been very fitting. It would have been nice to have a phone conversation with Paul thrown in there too, since he now has such a vital role in her life and is also a major character from previous books. <br /> <br />That being said, I still have praise for the book. I like Heath Jarrod's character and her transformation from a stubborn leave-me-alone paraplegic to an I-can-be-useful woman ready to take whatever action is necessary. I liked that the chapters alternated between Heath's and Anna's investigations. I think Anna should have an unofficial non-park-employee sidekick in every book. <br /> <br />All in all, a good read. I've loved every Anna Pigeon novel so far, this one included. But be prepared for some pretty dark moments.	2005-08-09

She has a job giving financial advice TV, she has paid off her debts, her relationship with Luke Brandon is going well, and Luke has promised to take Becky away for a weekend in the country. But you know that things won't stay perfect for long when it comes to Becky's life. Luke ends up spending their weekend away in business meetings, Becky's suitcase hasn't shown up (she shipped it to the inn because she overpacked), and Becky accidentally hears that Luke is planning to move to New York but he hasn't said a word about it to her. Things only get crazier from there. Becky manages to get herself into more than one scrape, including getting drunk at a lunch job interview, attending a wedding at which most everyone doubts the validity of Becky's claims to be dating the famous Luke Brandon, a disasterous meeting with Luke's mother, and a hilarious attempt to use a treadmill. And of course, there's lots of shopping. This second book in the series is just as fun and hilarious as the first!	2005-05-04

The cast of characters is enormous and the author describes each of their lives in far more detail than is strictly necessary. The complex lives of all these characters makes for a very complex plot, which at times can become quite confusing. The author takes a long time to weave his complicated tale, so the book starts off slowly. But stick with it. It starts to pull you in about a quarter of the way through. Ultimately, the book is about Daniel's (the narrator) quest to learn more about the obscure and seemingly forgotten author Julian Carax. This quest eventually introduces many subplots both in the present and the past. Eventually, all the threads of these little stories come together in the end and it all makes sense. Despite the slow beginning, by the end it's hard to stop reading.	2005-04-16

But I still learned quite a lot about punctuation from Truss' book, and had fun along the way. The author covers every kind of punctuation sprinkled liberally with examples of correct and incorrect usage. She also inserts humor every now and then, which is part of the reason why a book about punctuation has been such a hit. If you're a punctuation nut, this book is for you. But if you don't get too upset by misuse of punctuation, you might as well skip this one.	2005-03-30

Even though the main character solves several different mysteries throughout the story, the interesting part of this book is how it is written. It's set in Africa, so it's different from your standard mystery novel right off the bat. Plus, Smith's writing style is quite different from anything I've read before. In addition, there is no one central plot to this story, although there is one big mystery that Precious must solve. I didn't love this book, as many reviewers did, but I found it interesting and unique, so I must commend it for that.	2005-03-16

Krakauer's core story is that of the murderous Lafferty brothers, but he covers much more than that. He retells the history and evolution of the Mormon church as well as the story of the breakaway fundamentalists. These fundamentalists believe that polygamy (plural marriage) is sanctioned by God and that the mainstream Mormon church has erred enormously by condemning polygamy. Krakauer's history of Mormons - fundamentalist and mainstream alike - is a fascinating read.	2005-03-16

Everyone in Britain ran out to buy a copy after the 1960 trial that ruled the book was not obscene under the law and that Penguin had a right to publish the book in its entirety. But while it may have been sexually explicit for it's time, it's rather tame by 21st Century standards. And in any case, the sexual relations between Lady Chatterley and Mellors take up a proportionally small amount of the book. What everyone always seems to overlook is that this book is overall dreadfully boring. There are whole chapters devoted to completely asinine conversations that have no bearing on the story and make no sense. Such as Chapter 4, where several characters have a mind-numbingly dull conversation about Bolshevism. My advice, just skip these chapters. You'll finish the book a lot faster and you'll probably find it more entertaining. Still, I've never been a big fan of Lawrence and I think his books are all pretty dull and uninteresting. This is probably the most interesting of the lot (which isn't saying much), for the very reason that created all the controversy to begin with: a story of real humans having real experiences. Imagine that.	2004-10-11

However, it's just as supsensful as you'd expect from this author; I couldn't put it down. Part of what makes the book so suspensful is that the \\"villian\\" - the swarm of faceless nanoparticles - is one that is unfamiliar to us.

Somehow, Martel did just that, and did a good job at it. The ordeal that Pi and Richard Parker (the tiger) go through is vividly described, as they slowly waste away in the hot sun, thirsty and hungry during their seven and a half months at sea. The reader can feel the desperation and depression of their situation. Even though Pi's religious views play a small part in his castaway ordeal, the early part of the novel dealing with his religious awakening seems out of place and awkward in the story. But the other focus of the begining of the novel - describing zoo culture - is pretty interesting, along with Pi's ongoing explanations of animal behavior, particularly that of tigers. All in all, this was a pretty interesting book.	2004-07-23

But sometimes the characters' lack of depth kind of ruined the book for me. The whole scene between Lou and Ed towards the end was completely contrived and cheesey and seemed really out of place in the story. And the end of the book was very abrupt and a little lame. It just kind of fizzled out. All in all, it's a fun little book, but don't go looking for a good plot or in-depth characters.	2004-07-06

When Julian returns from being away, he is told his wife has run off with another man and that she has left her \\"bastard\\" child behind.

The house is haunted with the ghosts of the Manets, and Declan, together with Lena - the Louisiana woman he has fallen in love who also happens to be a descendent of Marie Rose - unravels the mystery of the house and its former inhabitants. <br />This is a good beach or airplane book. The characters are fun and quirky and Declan is appropriately romantic and persistent in his affections towards Lena. The reincarnation aspect (Declan and Lena are supposedly Lucian and Abigal reincarnated) was a little far-fetched, though.	2004-06-14
US	52629713	R2WJFQRPIPBOV7	0156011433	593236463	Snow Mountain Passage	Books	4	2	2	N	N	fascinating story	This book tells the story of the 87 stranded emigrants in the ill-fated Donner party, stuck in the Sierra Nevadas during the winter of 1846-1847, the worst winter on record in those mountains. The story is told from the perspectives of 8-year-old Patty Reed and her father James Reed, who was actually a far more prominent figure in the wagon party than either of the Donner brothers, for whom the tragedy, the lake, and the mountain pass are all named. While the Reed family is stranded with their fellow emigrants just short of the mountain summit, James Reed (who made it out of the mountains ahead of his family, and barely in time before the worst of the blizzards hit) is gallavanting around California, simultaneously fighting the ongoing war there and trying to drum up support for a rescue party to go in and get his family out of the mountains. This part of the story gets quite dull at times, especially since the author spends too much time describing the California landscape and not enough time describing action. Far more time is spent following Reed's journeys criss-crossing California than is spent on Patty's &quot;trail notes&quot; that describe what's going on at the emigrant's mountain camp. Still, it's a fascinating story, not for the traditional canibalistic slant that is always attributed to the tale (and in fact there's very little description of that in Houston's book), but because of the fact that despite the horribly difficult hardship those 87 people suffered that winter, 48 of them still managed to survive three months of slow starvation and bitter cold before they were finally rescued. This book will instill a healthy respect for mother nature as well as admiration for the tough spirit of those pioneers.	2004-06-11

This book tries to cover too many things, including the Holocaust, the life of a weird librarian, his &quot;relationship&quot; with a student, and his crazy wife who is now deceased. Everyone in the book is obsessed with the poet T.S. Eliot and snippets of his poems are scattered throughout the book at random and awkward moments which ultimately detract from the story instead of enhancing it. Cooley has an abstract philosophical way of writing which I found extremely annoying. The characters are too involved in their own selfish worlds and were completely uninteresting.

The reader is launched into Isabelle's story without an explanation of the current situation. I was halfway through the book before I realized that the author was talking about the reformation and Calvinism. The historical note at the end of the book should be at the beginning of the book so the reader can understand the context of the story. I also found it helpful to brush up on my reformation history. Isabelle's life is drastically affected by those historical events, so a basic understanding of them is necessary. <br />Like most readers, I enjoyed Isabelle's story more than Ella's. Ella's growing distaste for her husband, Rick, is a little confusing. I never really understood her motivations. She was a little too whiney and unhappy for my taste. So Isabelle was more interesting. However, I highly recommend looking at the family tree on page 127 (very end of chapter 4). The characters in Isabelle's story are never really introduced in relation to each other and it was quite confusing trying to figure out who was who and how they were all related.	2004-04-11

Frazier structures the book to tell the parallel stories of Inman, who is traveling a hard road home to Cold Mountain to escape the ravages of fighting in the Civil War, and of Ada, who is struggling to eke out an existence on her father's farm after her father's death. Frazier's writing style and language result in a somewhat sophisticated prose that transports the reader right into the story. I've read many many books and this is by far one of my favorites. After reading some of these reviews, I think that in an way, it's unfortunate that high schoolers are forced to read this book for their English classes. Even though I enjoyed English in high school, and even majored in it in college, I think I too would have disliked this book if I had read it in that context. This book was not meant to be ruined by picking it apart in high school English. This is a compelling story if you choose to read it and are not forced to do so.	2003-12-03

One review here mentioned how this book is so realistic that it seems like an autobiography, a statement that I would have to agree with. It's been mentioned a lot, but it's truly amazing that this very realistic female character was created by a male author. Considering that I could never in a million years convincingly write about a man, I think it's a terrific feat that Wally Lamb has created such a convincing woman. The book really held my interest as it followed the roller coaster life of Dolores Price, through all her ups and downs, of which there are many. Her father leaving, her mother having a breakdown and ending up in a mental hospital, moving to her grandmother's house where she hates living, getting raped at age 13, gaining a tremendous amount of weight during high school, and a death at age 18. So by the time she's 18, she's completely messed up, a spoiled brat who wants nothing more than to stuff her face with junk food and watch TV. She soon finds herself in a mental hospital just like her mother. She eventually ends up with a deadbeat husband who turns out to be immature and irresponsible and tries to drag Dolores down from the better life she has been attempting to create for herself. Throughout the whole book, you're wondering if Dolores will come out on top, if she'll overcome the unhappiness of her past life. Or will she sink back to the depths of psychological despair and misery? This is a compelling story to be sure.	2003-11-14

First there's the police investigation of Katie's murder, then there's Celeste's ponderings about just where David Boyle had been that night. The same facts and evidence are regurgitated over and over again. It's tedious. But eventually the story moves past that towards the resolution of the events of the story. While the crime is solved in a breathtaking and heartbreaking ending, ultimately the book has a sad and depressing conclusion. The solving of the crime doesn't really bring peace to any of the characters and the book ends on an empty note.

Fed up with being talked about his back and being accused as a liar, Harry spends a lot of this book being angry and lonely and losing his temper. He flies off the handle seemingly every other page in the first half of the book. It seems he has an uncontrollable temper, a lot of suppressed rage and bottled-up anger. He seems to have lost all sense of self-preservation and he seems intent on going around bad-tempered all the time making enemies and getting in trouble on a regular basis. He hates being whispered about, but he keeps giving people reasons to whisper. I got tired of reading about his constant unhappiness and his continual temper tantrums. It was overkill.<br />This book was a bit too long. It's not until 200 pages into the book that the students even arrive at Hogwarts. A lot of that first 200 pages is devoted to the description of cleaning the old Black house. One good part about the pre-Hogwarts story was that it was interesting to finally read about the offices of the Ministry of Magic. But on the whole, Rowling starts trying to create too many subplots in this book. And as usual, everything tries to get explained all in the last 20 pages, but there were a lot of questions left unanswered.<br />After five books, we find FINALLY find out at the end of this book the reasons why Harry is forced to spend his summers with the Dursley's. However, the explanation contradicts the fact that Harry had to be followed, guarded and protected during the first part of the summer, while he was still at the Dursley's. There were lots of other unanswered questions as well. What were the parchments that Bill and Mr. Weasley were looking at after the first Order of the Phoenix meeting that took place upon Harry's arrival? Why was the time and location of the hearing changed at the last minute and who changed it? Why did they have a full trial in the old courtroom? Why did Fudge seem flustered that Dumbledore managed to show up at the trial? What exactly was Umbridge's motivation for wreaking such havoc at Hogwarts? Why was Umbridge going to allow the Slytherin team to reform but not the Gryffindor team? What were the brains in the tank all about, and all the other strange stuff in the Department of Mysteries? What was with the veiled archway? Luna's \\"explanation\\" didn't really explain anything about what was behind that veil. And where did the person who fell through that veil end up going?<br />But the book wasn't all bad, not by any means. Despite the problems I had with it, I still found it more enjoyable than not. The focus of the story is Dumbledore's and Harry's efforts to convince the wizarding community that Harry is telling the truth about the return of Voldemort. There are new revelations about Harry's past and some ominous warnings about his future. Despite the overall gloomy mood of the novel, there are some fun parts. The awkward relations between Cho and Harry are highly entertaining. I wish there had been more of that. Ron's reaction to Ginny having a boyfriend is quite amusing. There some interesting new characters in this book. Dolores Umbridge is the Ministry of Magic employee who takes over the Defense of the Dark Arts position and makes enemies out of nearly everyone she meets. She is convincingly hateful, sickeningly sweet and maddeningly irritating. An awful woman. My favorite new character is Tonks, who is only seen briefly at the beginning and end of the book, but who is hilarious nonetheless.<br />I liked this book. It's not as good as the first four and there are too many ominous and dark parts for my taste, but I still enjoyed reading it. I do miss the lighthearted fun of learning about the magical world, though. For once, Harry thankfully doesn't end up in the hospital wing at the end of the book, but that doesn't change the fact thatthis book has a thoroughly depressing ending. It's one of the worst endings to a book that I've ever read.this book has a thoroughly depressing ending. It's one of the worst endings to a book that I've ever read.	2003-10-30

But this book makes it more real than any history book ever could. This is the story of a small British mountain village whose inhabitants become infected with plague when a contaminated shipment of cloth arrives from London. They decide to quarantine themselves, to not let anyone in or out of the village so as not to infect the surrounding villages. A courageous effort, to be sure, even more so considering that this book is loosely based on the true story of the village of Eyam which did indeed decide to quarantine itself in 1666. <br />Overall, this was an excellently told story. Brooks does a good job conveying the despair and exhaustion that comes after watching two-thirds of your friends and neighbors die from a horrible illness. It's a very real and moving story. However, I didn't like how the author started the book at the end of the plague year. The first chapter is the aftermath of the plague and the rest of the book is treated as a flashback of the year of the plague. I think it would have been more effective if the author had just started the story with chapter two, the introduction of the characters and the beginning of the plague. One other thing, the ending seemed out of place. It didn't really fit with the rhythm and story of the rest of the book. The fate of Anna Frith, the narrator, seems a little unusual and unexpected. But it's not a bad ending.<br />All in all, I really recommend this book. It's a compelling story.	2003-10-21

The only problem is that someone has entered Harry's name in the tournament despite the fact that he is too young. It soon becomes apparent that once again, someone wants Harry dead. This book is the turning point, where the happy and relatively carefree lives the characters have enjoyed up to this point are drastically changed by the end of the book. Things will start getting pretty dark now. I enjoyed this book just as much as the first three. As usual, there are some great new characters. Rita Skeeter, the nosy Daily Prophet reporter, is properly annoying and infuriating. Mad-Eye Moody is certainly an interesting character whose ferret punishment on Draco Malfoy was certainly very satisfying, even though it doesn't make sense that he would attack Lucius Malfoy's son when we find out all the facts at the end of the book. Dobby is back, along with a lot of other house elves. But despite Hermione's efforts to give house elves better lives, the creatures are really about as irritating as Star Wars' Jar-Jar Binks. One thing that was never explained was what the visiting students did all year long while at Hogwarts? Did they attend classes with the sixth and seventh year Hogswart students? Rowling is an excellent storyteller, but I often notice \\"holes\\" like these. Also, why does Harry end up in the hospital wing at the end of every single book? Still, despite some inconsistencies and holes, the book was quite good with the usual unexpected ending with a twist that you never see coming.	2003-10-15

His twin brother, Thomas, is a paranoid schizophrenic who believes he is God's messenger and that various government agencies are out to get him. Dominick's and Thomas' stepfather, while somewhat mellowed out in his old age, is revealed to have been a sadistic hateful abusive stepfather when the boys were young. Dominick struggles between love and hate for his deceased, meek, submissive, weak and fearful mother. And as this long novel unfolds, more people, many of whom are just as screwed-up as the rest of the characters, are introduced to the reader. Probably the most interesting and sickeningly fascinating part of the book is the self-righteous auto-biography of Dominick's Italian immigrant grandfather that is sprinkled throughout the last half of the novel. One thing I didn't like about this book, something that made it difficult to wade through at times, was the immense anger of the main character, Dominick. He spends nearly the entire book being angry at everybody and everything. There was a complete lack of joy and an intense negative vibe in the first two-thirds of the book. Other than that though, this was a really good book, at times hard to put down. Everything wraps up pretty neat and tidy at the end. But I'm not complaining because I hate it when a book as a bad ending.	2003-10-09

In addition, Lupin becomes almost a father figure to Harry, someone he can confide in and ask for advice, a teacher who is on Harry's side 99.9% of the time.

But I like the author's approach to the subject of seeking happiness in our life. As the title implies, the book is structured like a diet regimen. There are 10 life-enhancing &quot;menu items,&quot; such as truth, laughter, play, and creativity. Some of what you'll read here is similar to what you'll read in a lot of other books. But it's written creatively and succinctly. I like how the book is organized and I like its relatively compact size. She gets to the point and summarizes neatly at the end of each chapter for quick reference or for anyone who prefers to skim. Overall, a nice little book.	2003-09-26

But after all the hype, I decided to go ahead and read it. And to my surprise, I actually enjoyed it. At times, some of the technical aspects of horse racing got a bit dry.

Like in Jurassic Park, the characters are being chased and are racing the clock. But I enjoyed Jurassic Park, so the similarities didn't bother me.

Jan Karon went back and wrote the story of the wedding and this is the end product. I'm a hopeless romantic and I'm all for romantic love stories, but this book was WAY over the top, to an unrealistic degree. It seems like every other page, Father Tim is marveling at the joyful, desperate, blissful, dazzling, breathless, mesmerizing, overwhelming, extraordinary, happy, dazzling, astonishing, overpowering love he feels for his fiance (these are just some of the MANY adjectives used in much overabundance throughout the book). It just got too sappy and I didn't feel a connection with the characters at all. I listened to this book on tape from Recorded Books, and the last tape is an interview with Jan Karon. This was the one redeeming quality of sitting through the whole story. Karon sounds like a wonderfully nice person with great inspiration and a solid faith. Even though the last few books have seemed a little too unrealistic and dry, I enjoyed hearing the background of how the Mitford novels came about. I don't know if I'll read any more books in the series. It's gotten to the point where the description of ordinary people living ordinary lives has evolved into a near-utopia, with little to none of the problems that ordinary people in the real world experience.	2003-08-27

Essentially \\"chased\\" from Philadelphia after a mysterious incident with a female student which is not explained to the reader until much later in the book, teacher Imogene Grezlnick moves to a small farming town in rural Pennsylvania to take up a teaching position there. She befriends one of her oldest students, Sarah, who takes a liking to her new teacher. Their relationship blossoms, even more so as Sarah struggles to survive her marriage with her abusive husband, Sam. Eventually, Imogene's past catches up her and Sarah becomes inadvertently involved, so the two women are forced to leave Pennsylvania. They move to Reno, Nevada, and later still, to a stage stop in the desert, Round Hole. The often bizarre relationship between the strong-willed, strong-spirited Imogene and the exceedingly weak, frail and shy Sarah (often annoyingly delicate and feeble to the point of pure exasperation) develops slowly throughout the novel, ending in a rather unconvincing partnership. <br />It took too long for the story to get going, but once it did, it moved right along and kept my attention. During the time in Caliope and Reno, the story was pretty good and well-written, containing all the best elements of an adventurous life in the West. But after the girls moved out to Round Hole, it started going downhill, all the way to the terrible ending, which was swift and abrupt and lame. The charade that they try to maintain throughout the last third of the book is completely unbelievable and more than a little ridiculous. I thought it was a very poor way to get the two women out of a difficult situation and it just didn't work at all. Still, except for the last part of the book and the unconvincing relationship that develops between the two friends, I thought this was a pretty good story.	2003-08-19

A change of scenery to introduce some new people and stories. Still, it seems the main character spends most of his time either praying or saying &quot;consider it done.&quot; The characters seem to lack depth and almost everyone is perfect. And the people who aren't perfect still get to have happy endings. The things that make for a good story - a character who wants something and is trying to get it against all odds, a plot that has a climax, a believable antagonist and protagonist, etc. - are lacking in this book.	2003-08-12

I was bored and confused in every single one of them. Reading this book was the first time in my life that science was interesting to me. While this book might not sound very interesting at first, it really is very fascinating. With his typical humor and wit, Bill Bryson has written a condensed history of why we are here and how it all came to be.<br />This book covers all the bases. Space, stars and planets; geology, earthquakes and volcanoes; dinosaurs; the development of chemistry and physics; climate, weather, our atmosphere and the oceans; how the first life began, evolution, and how humans came to be; microorganisms and bacteria; and of course extinction and the wanton destruction of plants and animals by humans. And he weaves it all together into a fascinating history with a wide range of bizarre characters and events, amazing coincidences, and some missed opportunities, all the while introducing all sorts of interesting facts that I've never heard before. I learned a lot from this book and I enjoyed reading it. Another Bill Bryson classic.	2003-07-29

Clarence Gibbs owns the houses and the surrounding property and is evicting everyone to tear it all down and build a water bottling plant, of all things. Miss Julia won't stand for it, though, and with the help of her friends and eventually the whole town, she sets out to raise enough money to buy the land and houses from Gibbs before he can carry out his plan. But to Miss Julia's dismay, the biggest fundraising event of all might be one she has to participate in herself: riding a motorcycle.

They should have given up on their commitment to 12 books and ended it with this one. The book ends just moments before the return of Christ, which means that the authors are going to try to deal with the events that follow His return in the next book. While I'm curious to see how they describe life on earth upon the return of Jesus and the destruction of Carpathia and company, I'm also surprised that the authors would try to tackle something that's based on even more speculation than the events in the first 11 books. It's one thing to describe how you think the devil would ruin the world, but quite another to presume to describe what heaven on earth would be like afterwards. The action and dialogue in book 11 are painfully cheesy and unrealistic. The last half of the series hasn't been near as gripping and interesting as the first half was. I think the whole series could have been written in eight or nine books, easily, maybe even seven: one for each year of the tribulation.

I've found that most found modern Catholic churches aren't very beautiful, so I aggreed with a lot he had to say. But he obviously had an axe to grind and it was apparent on every page. It sometimes tainted the message, I thought. My biggest complaint was with the photographs. Most of the captions are completely unoriginal, just excerpts from the text. Less than a quarter of the photographs had captions that explained exactly what the picture showed, which church it was, etc. It wasn't until I leafed through to the end that I discovered a photo credits appendix. Why the photo credits couldn't be on the same page as the photos themselves is beyond me. I was also frustrated when he would mention a particluarly ugly church but not provide a picture of it. I had to go online to find photos of some of the churches he talked about, just so his comments made sense.	2003-07-07

The story of Jondalar and Thonolan was exceedingly dull and could have been at least half as long as it was. For having so little pertinence to what happens later, it was way too long. Alya's intermittent story in the first 18 chapters was still worth reading, though. But it wasn't until chapter 19, when Jondalar and Ayla meet that it started to get really interesting. After that, the book was a much faster read.

I learned a lot about the early days of the human race through this book, and the story was great too. Ayla comes from the race of The Others, the more highly developed humans who are mistrusted by the clan who adopts the young orphan girl when she is five. The clan is deeply rooted in tradition and customs and doesn't like change or deviation from the norm. So taking Ayla in takes some getting used to. But through the years, they adjust to her presence, and she grows up as part of their culture. She's different from them, though - she knows it and they know it and it's always hanging over them. But she pushes on, overcoming obstacles and standing up for herself every step of the way.<br />I won't spoil the ending, but I was sorry it ended at the point in the story where it did. It would have been far more satisfying to see what happens after the events at the end of the book. There would have been a certain sense of satisfaction in seeing the inevitable decline and destruction that would most certainly occur under the new leadership.

If you're not a hacker, you probably can't completely understand their world, but this book is still an interesting insight into the lives and activities of some well-known hackers.	2003-06-05

I got very tired of Father Tim's constant contemplation of his new marriage, how much it had changed it his life, and how he could hardly believe his fortune. How had he survived all these years without Cynthia? How could he have not known what he was missing? And so on, over and over and over again. This book seems filled with more cheesy dialogue, old-fashioned language, and quaint expressions than the first two. And it seemed to me that nearly everything written about Father Tim's and Emma's new computer was completely made up by someone who had never used a computer before. However, all criticism aside, I still enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the fourth one.	2003-05-15

The book details the year he spent living there, working for the small community newspaper and playing for the local Gaelic football team. Though it sounds like this might be an amusing book about a fish out of water, about a big-city guy adapting to small-town life, it's not really as amusing as it sounds. The author adjusts to his new life and learns the ways of small-town life. Period. And it's not really that entertaining or amusing. There's some funny anecdotes here and there, but not as many as you'd think, and it ultimately took me quite awhile to get through this book.	2003-05-10

Because of a bizarre psychological disorder, Jed believes that he is in love with Joe and Joe in love with him. Jed begins to stalk Joe, causing so much distress in his life that his wife, Clarissa, thinks he might be going crazy. An appendix at the end reveals that the story is based on a true case history of the syndrome that Jed suffers from, which makes it all the more creepier. It sure makes you hope you're never a victim of someone with the disorder. The only complaint I have about the book is that the author sometimes goes off on irrelevant tangents about random subjects. They ultimately don't contribute to the story so there seems to be no point to them. But overall, even though this is kind of a weird book, it's a good book.	2003-05-10

It starts off with a nice introduction about picnicking, logistics, menus, and neccesities. An example of some the recipes: squid salad, garlicky white bean puree with broccoli di rape, Greek Islands sea bass, and caponata on bruschetta. There are a few down-to-earth simple recipes, but for the most part, these are for fancy picnics. Some nice photographs, and good readable text.	2003-05-07

The story lines in this book seemed more compelling, more interesting. Father Tim deals with the long absence (most of the book) of his neighbor, Cynthia, while she writes her new book in New York. He also deals with Edith Mallory, a recent widow with her sights set not only on the rector but on a well-known Mitford establishment too. Sadie Baxter tells more of her interesting life stories while she arranges for the long-closed ballroom in her house to be fixed up for the wedding of a relative she didn't know she had. And the man in charge of construction of the new Hope House seems to be quite a rough old sourpuss.

I was able to keep it in my purse the whole time and whip it out at a moment's notice.

The book is divided categorically by type of food (appetizers, side dishes, main dishes, etc.). The book is interspersed with helpful bits of information such as the best foods for tailgate picnics, what the well-stocked picnic basket should contain, and grill tips. There are nice color photographs, though it would have been nice to have pictures of more of the recipes. If you have refined tastes for fancy picnics, this book is for you.

She puts her imagination to work writing stories and plays and seeking out exciting and interesting things from her life to use in her stories. In her desperate need for some story-worthy excitement on which to base a story, Briony turns on her sisters love interest, Robbie Turner. Turning him into a violent maniacal murderer in her mind, she doesn't hesitate to accuse him of the rape of her 15-year-old cousin, even though she didn't clearly see the attacker. In the aftermath of her accusation, too young to give voice to any to any doubts she might have and too nave to realize the consequences of her actions, she tells the police what she's convinced she saw, forever changing the lives of herself and her family. The book is divided into four parts. The first part is devoted to character development, the rape, the accusation. The second part is five years later, during the war. Robbie is fighting in France and Briony's sister, Cecilia, is a nurse in London. The third part focuses on Briony and her own nurses training, as well as her struggle to come to grips with her past actions. The final part is many decades later, when Briony is in her 70s, reflecting on the past. I thought this was a very well-written book. Something about the author's writing style really clicked with me. The story dragged at times, and I wasn't entirely satisfied with the ending, but it was definitely worth reading.	2003-04-22

This book is a fun read, but don't expect an exciting plot. There isn't a central problem or conflict to resolve.

This time, Anna is stationed at Fort Jefferson at Dry Tortugas Park, a set of small islands off the coast of Florida. There is the usual large cast of primary and peripheral characters and the usual twist at the end that makes it hard to guess just who the criminal is during the first half of the book. Every other chapter focuses on Anna's ancestors who were at the fort in its active days. I found this storyline somewhat interesting, but kind of distracting. The book would have been fine without it. Still, I enjoyed the book and can't wait for the twelfth!	2003-04-18

What I liked about this book was the division of recipes into the four chapters and I really liked that there were full color photographs of every recipe in the book. That being said, I didn't really like many of the recipes themselves. Maybe it's just my tastes, but none of the recipes really appealed to me in my preparation for a picnic. With recipes like curried eggs, watercress &amp; herb soup, and oven-baked eggplant sald, I didn't find too many appealing things to make here. Maybe someone with more refined tastes would like this book better.	2003-04-16

It's an incredible story, especially the details and planning that went into pulling off the robbery.  It sounds like it's straight out of a movie (the story has in fact been made into a movie), but the story is true.  This is different from the other Crichton books I've read, like Jurassic Park and Congo, but it's still pretty good.  The only bad thing I have to say about it is the blinding orange cover on the book that makes you want to rip it off.	2003-03-31

Almost the entire first half of the book is devoted to the one-day rescue of George Sebastian in Greece, some of which is exciting reading.  Fortunately, after several books of making little headway timewise, the second half of this book jumps ahead months at a time, so that by the end, there's less than two years left in the tribulation.  That helped make it a little more interesting reading than previous books, but there's still a lot of time devoted to meaningless details.	2003-03-11

As has been mentioned in other reviews, this book was published in the UK, so it's not quite as helpful a book for American readers like me.  This is especially true after a quick scan of the book, which quickly reveals the complete dislike the authors feel about America.  This is revealed in discussions of the rubbish of American TV leaking into Canada and comments such as \\"It isn't usual to ask people personal questions such as their age or how much they paid for things - both are considered rude (unlike in the States where such questions are commonplace).\\"  Last time I checked, it was still impolite to ask those questions here.  Anyway, there's some good basics on Canadian life here, but I wouldn't say it's a good all-around guide for someone thinking of moving to Canada.	2003-03-09

It just didn't get me like the other ones did.  This latest book is about the turbulent relationship between Ruth and her widowed mother LuLing.  Ruth has never really understood why her mother acts the way she does, but when LuLing begins to show signs of Alzheimers, Ruth begins to discover many things about her mother's past that have been kept secret for many years.  The 165-page flashback of LuLing's early life in China is very good, but it's at the end of the book.  It would have been better to read that whole flasback first, because it explained all of the mysterious and unexplained references in the first half of the book.  I had to go back and re-read the first half again, now that I knew what everything meant.  So, if you're a Tan fan, this won't disappoint, but it doesn't quite live up to her first books.	2003-03-09

And remember how Buck and Rayford thought they saw someone who looked like Hattie at the Jerusalem gala in the last book?  That still hasn't been explained.  Chaim Rosenzweig FINALLY becomes a believer in this book.  I was getting VERY tired of hearing everybody try to persuade him to convert, so tired of hearing the same arguments and persuasions over and over again, book after book.  Tsion has some bizarre and strange \\"dreams\\" in this book that are just too weird, and Rayford and Albie have a seemingly pointless confrontation at the end of the book.  There were a few good points in the book.  The banter between David and Guy was amusing.  There were some \\"cliffhanger\\" moments.

There was a lot of description and detail - a lot of which I felt unnecessary - that slowed the story down.  This is a contemplative book, not a page-turner.  More time is spent on long descriptions than on the events of the story.  Also, there is no sense of justice for Susie's murder.  Mr. Harvey's ultimate fate seems hallow and empty and the murder is never solved.  The family never gets a real sense of closure, but just kind of falls to pieces ...

Rayford is trying to confirm if Amanda was on a plane that crashed into the Tigris River, while Buck desperately tries to find a wounded Chloe before GC officials find her first.  I appreciate any light-heartedness or humor that the authors write into these books, since the content is naturally often dark and forboding.  The funniest scene in the series so far occurs in this book, as Buck and his friend Ken Ritz - wounded and drugged - pull off a hospital rescue with more than a few glitches.  While the book moves along at a good pace, I still found it incredible that the majority of the book covered such a short amount of time, just a few weeks.  Looking forward to reading the next book.	2003-02-02
US	52629713	R3EJCHTDZG6JGL	0375502238	955709915	Blessings	Books	4	1	1	N	N	handy-man turned mom	This is the story of Lydia Blessing, her resident handy-man, Skip, and the baby he finds at his front door one morning.  The story is about how Skip falls in love with the mystery baby and how the two of them soften the old routine-loving Mrs. Blessing.  The basic story is good, but a great deal of the book explores the pasts of both Lydia and Skip in a way that is very disrupting to the telling of the main story.  Sometimes the flasback is only a paragraph or two, sometimes several pages, but the transitions between past and present are not smooth and sometimes random.  I was halfway through the book before I figured out who all these people from the past were and how they relate to the characters.  Still, it's a pretty good book, and even though it doesn't have the greatest ending, it's still enjoyable enough.	2003-02-02

This book brings alive the culture and rhythm of Tuscan living.  As the author describes the renovation of the house and grounds and settling into Italian life, you wonder to yourself why life can't be more like that everywhere.  This book made me want to go buy a house in Italy too!	2003-01-28

There's more action, more events happening, not so much downtime and thinking and pondering of the characters.  Many parts are edge-of-your-seat reading, so read and enjoy!	2003-01-27

For the first half of the book, I got very tired of hearing repeatedly how they marveled at their past ignorance and how now their new-found knowledge was so liberating.  This book tended to be more preachy than the first one, which I found tiresome.  I enjoyed the brief conflict between Buck and Verna.  It lent a down-to-earth aspect to the story, a nice break from the often supernatural-like events of the rest of the story.  All in all, definitely worth reading.	2003-01-22

Some of the things that happened - not including the rapture or any of the religious stuff - were a little implausible, and I have to say that the very final scene in the airport parking lot was more than corny.  However, this was definitely an intriguing story and really got me thinking.  Despite a few slow spots, this was a book that was sometimes hard to put down.  I'm eager to read the next book.	2003-01-15

Jessie believes the Lord wants her to go out west to convert the Indians, so she and Emma pack up and leave home. After a run-in with two unsavory characters on the way to Independence, Jessie decides it's too dangerous for them to appear as two vulnerable women traveling alone, so Em dresses up as a boy and pretends to be Jessie's young brother, Emmett. From Independence, they head out on the Oregon Trail with the Donner family, and so the fun begins. The adventures that follow make for a great and hilarious story. Indian raids, unwanted marriage proposals, fake preachers, \\"divine\\" interventions, daring rescues, near starvation, the effort of keeping up Em's disguise, and a cast of wacky characters - including the mountain men Mego Cobb and Mr. Garrett - make this book hard to put down. Though it is now unfortunately out of print, it's worth the effort to track down a used copy online. You won't regret it.	2003-01-11

Even up until the end I wasn't sure.  It felt like the author couldn't decide which character to focus on, so she jumped around from one to another in abrupt transitions.  I found the character of Marianne rather annoying.  She came across as fragile and naive, a flighty and delicate thing who doesn't really understand the world and who carries the blame for everything that goes wrong in her life, including her rape.  Overall, this was an okay story, but it seemed to lack direction and focus.	2002-11-22

Even still, I enjoyed Eaters of the Dead.  It moves kind of slow at times, and the writing style isn't what I'm used to from Crichton, since this is written in the style of an ancient manuscript.  But the basic storyline is interesting and exciting.	2002-10-27

My biggest complaint was that the story moved way too slow and that it was constantly being interrupted by Tolstoy's philosophical preaching and political discourse.  Barely half the story is even devoted to the character whose name is the title of the novel.  There were long and unneccessary pasages that had nothing to do with the rest of the story, like the hunting chapters.  Anna's irrational and crazy jealousy was irritating.  One minute she loves him, the next she hates him, then she loves him again.  Anyway, this may be considered a great literary classics, but I've read better.	2002-10-23

I loved every part of this book except I was mildly dissatisfied with the ending.  I didn't feel that the motives behind Mrs. Whiting's actions were really explained.  And the fate of the town is kind of left up in the air, I felt.  Still, this is a book well worth reading.	2002-09-21

But it wasn't anything like that.  It's an analysis of hospitals written over 30 years ago.  Some parts of the book are informative, but even though Crichton doesn't use a lot of fancy medical jargon, I think people in the medical profession would get far more out of this book than the average lay person.  I've read many of Crichton's other books, but this one isn't anything like his others, so don't expect a thrilling page-turner if you read this book.	2002-09-03

I got tired of reading over and over again about the sound of rain, how the air smelled, how the sky looked, how red/auburn/copper/cinnamon Jaimie's hair is.  I like hearing about what life was like in the 1770's, but I could be spared the myriad details.  There wasn't really a central theme to the plot. It was more a collection of small adventures, and it seemed that more pages were devoted to the time before and after those adventures than on the action itself.  This book was a bit of a disappointment after the suspense and action of the first four books.  I'm giving it four stars simply because I was happy to have another installment of Jaimie and Claire's life and for the interesting adventure/suspense sequences.	2002-08-12

Some of the scenes and events are a little outrageous, but it's just to show how unbelievably demanding and unreasonable these rich parents can be.  It was grand fun (and sometimes very frustrating) to read about the snobby rich people who are ultimately all unhappy and makes me feel thankful I'm not one of them.  The plight of the underloved children is sad to read about.  But mostly it was a fascinating and laughable read.	2002-07-17

This is also the kind of book that I think is best enjoyed in an English class setting, because I didn't get much out of it on my own, despite my English studies background.  I was constantly plagued by the annoying nature of David, a sissy mama's boy who is terrified of anything and everything in the world.  The story moved slowly and some of the language was hard to wade through.  Like I said, this is best read in a classroom/discussion setting.	2002-06-20

There's quite a few of the normal mishaps, adventures and debacles that the Frasers always seem to find themselves in the midst of and that make the book a page-turner.  One complaint, though: are the Fraser women forever doomed to endure their pregnancies and birth of their children without their husbands?  Roger's long absence was distressing.  Also, the story of the Englishmen Murchison and Hodgepile seemed less than fully developed and didn't really contribute to the overall story.  It could have been left out.  Still, if you're a fan of the Outlander books, this book is a great continuation of the story.	2002-06-06

It was the first Irving book I'd ever read and I was hooked.  Since then, I've read most of his other books, and while I enjoyed most of then, Owen Meany is still the best.  I reread it again and finished it last night and was pleased to discover that it was just as good as I remembered it.  Irving is a gifted writer and this book is his best written.  This will continue to be in my top five list of the best books ever written.	2002-05-26

They managed to find just as many problems and scrapes to get into as they did in the first two books, and it was always interesting to read about how they'd get themselves out of trouble.  But it could be shorter if not so many pages were devoted to repeated and detailed descriptions of every little thing.  Also, the majority of chapter 61 - the weird fireside voodoo ceremony of the slaves - could have been left out.  It really didn't have much to do with the story and wasn't very interesting.  All in all though, it was a pretty good book.	2002-05-24

The lengthy dry descriptions of nature that made up a lot of the beginning of the book and that were peppered throughout the rest of the story got boring.  But I liked how the author slowly started to show the relationships between all the characters and I liked how their stories began to intertwine with each other.  I really liked the Garnett-Nannie story; quite amusing.  The book was a bit preachy, but a good read nonetheless.	2002-05-11

The author's reading of his novel in this audiobook was one of the best I've ever heard.  I couldn't help but keep listening to find out what would happen next in Inman's adventurous journey home and to find out how Ada and Ruby were getting along on the farm.  Someday when I have time, I hope to read the book in print.	2002-01-10

The narrator did a pretty good job, though his voice reminded me of a grandfather, not a 40-something guy.  As for the story, I liked the fact that you never really knew what was going to happen next.  I couldn't figure out what Macon was going to do, where he was going to go, and ultimately, which woman he was going to choose to be with.  The relationships presented in the story, most of them troubled and/or messed up in some way, were rather fascinating.  Overall, a farily good read...or listen.	2001-11-10
