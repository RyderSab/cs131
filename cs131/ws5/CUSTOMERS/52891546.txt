I've been a fan of the Battletech/Mechwarrior universe for some time, now, and really enjoy Loren Coleman's contributions to the Mechwarrior Universe. First off, the good. ROC seems to be providing an editor (finally) who catches typos and grammatical mistakes. I think I only caught one in this book. Style-wise, Sword of Sedition is done well, like most Coleman Mechwarrior novels. The book centers around the leaders of the Inner Sphere trekking to Terra for the funeral of Victor Steiner-Davion. The story seems to be used primarily to set up the new characters who will (hopefully) carry the story arc into the future. Action is minimal until the latter third of the book, but the set-up is nice. The story arc, such as it is, continues to advance.<br /><br />*minor spoilers ahead*<br /><br />Unfortunately, this novel seems to be almost a rehash of the previous Battletech world. And while I miss the good ol' days of Victor, Kai, and the crazy Capellans, I was hoping that Mechwarrior would try to branch out and diversify itself from its predecessor. Instead, I find that I am reading about the noble Federated Suns led by their prince, Harrison aka the Bear (Hanse, the fox, Harrison, the Bear...original) who stand firm with the Republic that Victor died to protect. Yawn. Harrison, of course, has a Prince's Champion named Julian who seems to be the spiritual reincarnation of Victor. The token \\"wild girl,\\" 'Calamity' Kell is introduced as well as Yori Kurita.  The Kuritans, of course, manage to be rude to the Davions who graciously overlook the insults given them because they are Davions and that's what Davions do best.  I won't spoil the ending, but for people familiar with the story of Victor from the previous series, Sword of Sedition seems to read like same story, different characters.<br /><br />I hope that the future brings some surprises for the MechWarrior universe.  I would greatly like to see Katana Tormak and the Dragon's Fury written about and the Kuritans given more print. Ditto with the Capellan Confederation. Please, WizKids, give us fans something new and different to enjoy. While I'll continue to support the series, I find that I don't pay as much attention to the stories as I used to....maybe because I read them all 10 years ago.the Dragon's Fury written about and the Kuritans given more print.

Flight of the Falcon brings back our favorite, tradition-bound, Jade Falcons. Except this time, the Falcons are less tradition oriented than in previous books. The Falcons, taking advantage of the Republic's misfortunes, decides to move into the Skye system in order to gain a foothold for future expansion. Introduced are two sibkin who both have Bloodnames, a rarity. Malvina and Aleks Hazen provide the sterotypical opposites-Malvina is vicious and bloodthirsty, while Aleks proves to be more thoughtful and strategy-oriented. Both are Galaxy Commanders, working to conquer Skye. Countess Tara Campbell and the Highlanders once again provide the defense for the Republic, with Countess Campbell receiving some help from an old acquaintance. I enjoyed this novel as I have previous ones in the series. However, I am starting to have a problem with the fact that while BattleMechs are supposed to be a rarity, everyone still seems to have plenty of them. The Industrial, Forestry, and Construction Mechs play a large role in the Dark Age Game, and I would hope that they'd continue to play a larger role in the novels. That being said, those Mechs aren't as fun to read about due to their armament limitations. Also as these novels progress, it is hard to see how the Republic continues to even stand against all of their foes. With the multitude of factions constantly sniping at their borders it seems unlikely that Tara Campbell can continue to be the main defense...after all, she can't be everywhere at once! Overall, though, this book serves its purpose-it is entertaining and it continues the story arc. I'm looking forward to future installments of this series.	2004-06-05
US	52891546	RYRZLU6XCE8HD	0451459709	857336762	Patriot's Stand: A Battletech Novel (Mechwarrior: Dark Age, No. 9)	Books	4	4	5	N	N	An interesting interlude	When I first began this novel, I thought that I would be disappointed. The story seemed to be moving slowly and predictably-A desperate defense by the underdogs foils the nefarious plans of the well-armed, well-disciplined mercenary troops. However, the story is not that simple. In this story, the underdogs do fight back, but the catch is that the mercenary troops they are supposed to fight against end up having reservations about fighting them, which affects the outcome. This tale deals more with honor amongst soldiers than it does with the fall of the HPG net, but it provides a nice escape from the main Dark Age storyline. No faction plays a major role in this novel; however, Patriot's Stand could end up as a jumping off point for some of the more colorful characters introduced. If you are interested in the complete Dark Age world, then this book fits in nicely, but if you are desperately hoping to find out more about your favorite faction or why the HPG net is down, you can probably live without this one. Just bear in mind that you will miss a well-written novel with an interesting angle on the Mechwarrior world.	2004-04-14

Headed by Duke Aaron Sandoval, the reader learns about the Duke's plans to carve a piece of the Republic for House Davion.  Aaron's cousin, Eric Sandoval, returns as a more developed character who is coming into his own as a player in this interstellar power struggle.  The book moves at a rapid pace and does a good job at advancing the Dark Age storyline.  As another reviewer noted, it is interesting to see the Sandovals, in essence, breaking their oaths to the Republic, but at the same time, their loyalty to House Davion remains strong. It will be interesting to see if WizKids continues the old BattleTech trend of having the Davions/Sandovals win all of the time at the expense of the Capellans/Kuritas. This book seems to be leaning towards that interpretation, but with the twist of Sandoval greed and selfishness thrown in instead of Davion &quot;honor.&quot;  Fans of the series will most likely enjoy this book due to its inclusion of some of the major characters from the game and for the continuity of the families from the previous BattleTech series.	2004-03-04

Not only does the story bring together some of the Unique and Limited Edition figures from the game, but it is interesting to boot.  This novel, the conclusion of the trilogy finds Tara Campbell, Countess of Northwind and leader of the Northwind Highlanders, fighting to save Terra from the Steel Wolves, led by Anastasia Kerensky.  Tara must deal with the rogue Paladin, Ezekiel Crow, an unbelieving Exarch, and the wily Kerensky.  Paladin Jonah Levin of the Limited Edition Atlas figure fame is introduced as well.<br />I appreciated the fact that Delrio included some character depth in the form of some of the Higlanders infantry; the three seargents, Will, Jock, and Lexa, are a nice reprieve from the &quot;powers that be&quot; residing on high and making decisions that could affect the entire Republic.  Ezekiel Crow's character also is well-developed, and his fate within the Republic seems to have taken a turn for the worse, but makes for a much more interesting read than a Paladin whose loyalty belongs solely to the Republic.<br />One thing that I would like to see is more development of One Eyed Jack and his mercenaries.  We're getting hints of Bannson's game, but I'd like to see more direct focus on Jacob and his megalomanical schemes.<br />Overall, though, this is a very satisfying conclusion to Dark Age's first trilogy.  Hopefully, the success of this trilogy will induce WizKids to allow more of them as storyline development seems to proceed better when the same author has a chance to really go into the details without other authors slipping in books between with sometimes unrelated material.<br />Looking forward to the next novel.	2003-11-09

When I saw that this version had the story of how Ender's parents met, I went ahead and bought it. It was well worth the money.<br />The Polish Boy is about Ender's father, John Paul, as he is growing up in Poland. It details John Paul's religious upbringing as well as how he became intertwined with the International Fleet. Captain Graff makes an appearance, making Ender's Game a much more interesting story when you realize Graff has dealt with Ender's family before.<br />Teacher's Pest details the earliest meeting of Ender's parents. Ender's father, John Paul, is taking a class taught by Ender's mother, Theresa. The reader is introduced to Theresa's religious upbrining as well.  The rest is history. I love the irony of this story when one takes into account the role that Captain Graff plays in the Wiggin's lives.<br />Investment Counselor is a fun story about how Ender meets his computer friend, Jane, and is able to remain anonymous amongst a population that now reviles the deeds he did as a child.<br />Finally, the original Ender's Game novella is presented. While somewhat different than the novel, and much shorter, it is always fun to see how the Ender phenomenom began.<br />Overall, I would purchase this book even if you have the original version. I found Teacher's Pest to be a touch sadistic as Card sets the stage for Ender's eventual removal from his family. I felt like I had to squirm as John Paul and Theresa spoke with each other about the International Fleet and its designs for humanity.  Hopefully, many others will enjoy as well.	2003-08-13

I am more acquainted with the MechWarrior Universe, but I thought I'd give Mage Knight a go. I enjoyed this novel. As a newcomer to this universe, I found that Bill McCay did a good job in explaining about the Atlantean Empire and the Rebels who were fighting against them. The incorporation of various races such as dwarves and orcs added to the fantasy in the novel. The story is good, if predictable. The Rebels, developing a new weapon known as gunpowder, have worried the Atlantean elites. Guardsman Blaize is charged by the Empire to find and root out the Rebels. Along the way, he must question his commitment to the Empire as he sees the policies that his Empire enacts against others. While the story does follow a typical adventure novel, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I recommend it along with WizKids other game universes.	2003-07-01

Tara Bishop graces us with her presence and we see the return of the Kerenskys once again. I was impressed and surprised to see Anastasia Kerensky's philosophy differed from the Warden Ulric that I knew and loved, but it makes for a much more twisted story. I was disappointed, though, to see the relative ease with which one of the main characters from the game was so removed from the MechWarrior Dark Age Universe and the fact that the Steel Wolves just can't seem to get a break. Maybe the people at WizKids are thinking that the Wolves were just too powerful in the previous story arcs, but I would like to see them win at least one battle!! The action in this book is good and I am looking forward to the sequel.  I'm also hoping that we'll find out more about the Liao campaigns as the storyline progresses. For us old-timers, this book goes a ways to redeeming the storyline from The Ruins of Power novel. A good read overall.	2003-06-15

I felt that none of the characters had much depth. Austin seems to be this Rambo-esque hero who pretty much has to be superman (I mean, who else among us can reprogram a Mech, then load it up with Autocannon and missile ammo singlehandedly). Yet, like all supermen, he seems to lack intelligence. Alas and alack, our villian also suffers from predictablity. Her ingenious plans to rule the planet are going to be foiled due to her grandiose ego. The book's finale did lack the fast and furious Mech action that we all love, and the conclusion did little to add closure to an otherwise lackluster novel. I must say, though, that Jerome Parsons is a character I'd like to see again, however. Overall, this is a book that can be skipped in the series.	2003-06-11

The initial books were really well done and interesting, but I find myself buying these latest additions to the SW universe because of fan loyalty. Heretic II is a decent book, but I must agree with many of my fellow reviewers that it is somewhat predictable. I was never a fan of the Bakura story when it first came out, and the sudden about face of the Ssi-ruuk and the subsequent storyline seemed a little unimaginative. Tahiri's problems continue to be my favorite story line, especially as the Ssi-ruuk and Jacen's adventures in Chiss space are rather dull. Nom Anor also proves to be an interesting character, but again, it appears that this is at the expense of the classic SW characters. Overall, it is a decent read, but don't get your expectations up too high. I hope that the conclusion of the New Jedi Order will make more of us fans happier.	2003-06-02

This volume contains ten simulations that cover history, politics, and geography. They are easy to understand, come with detailed instructions, and the students enjoy them. One aspect I enjoyed about this book was that the instructions break down how to utilize the simulation with different level students-from basic to advanced. This is helpful for teachers who have a diverse student population. I ran the Alliance simulation dealing with World War I this semester and my students really enjoyed it. I found that the simulation did indeed work for all levels of students. I plan on using the U.S. geography simulation and the Peace in the Middle East simulation when I next reach those eras in my class. A+++	2003-05-29

Coleman returns to the MechWarrior Universe with another well-conceived story. Reservist Raul Ortega finds himself defending the Republic and his home from the predations of the Steel Wolves and the Swordsworn. In doing so, Raul goes from a Customs Official to full-fledged MechWarrior in style. As mentioned in another review, the Jupiter and Legionairre BattleMechs debut as well as a Tundra Wolf and Hatchetman. What I really enjoyed, though was how the book kept to the essense of the new game in that infantry, vehicles, and modified Industrial Mechs played a larger role in the battles. Clearly, this book is anticipating the new additions to the MW: Dark Age game coming soon in the Fire for Effect expansion.<br />The characters were well-written as well. Raul is a good character, though somewhat stereotypical of the MechWarrior Universe (nice guy who believes in honor and defending his beliefs, etc.), but I really enjoyed Tassa Kay (if you are familiar with the old Battletech Game, you should be able to figure out her secret fairly quickly) as a foil of stalwart Raul. Eric Sandoval and Star Colonel Torrent make for good \\"bad guys\\" and the reader can see the Republic being torn asunder by factionalism.<br />Overall, a good book. I am looking forward to more mayhem in the Battletech Universe. For those interested, a prequel to this novel can be found online at wizkidsgames.com under their fiction link. It details more of Eric Sandoval and how he came to be sent to Achernar.	2003-02-15

Mr. Younis provides a nice overview of the tenets of Islam, the contradiction of American values in stigmatizing Muslims since September 11th, and the tensions and history involved in dealing with the current turmoil in Palestine. I especially agreed with the assertation that the so-called \\"moderate\\" Islam is actually the original Islam as taught by Muhammad. The author has a perspective that he wishes to share with fellow Americans, be they Muslim or not, and incorporates current and scholarly references in his defense of that view. It is hoped that Mr. Younis will continue to expand on his ideas in subsequent books as these essays are really brief introductions to his views. The book is not difficult to read and would serve as a good reader for high school level and above classes dealing with current trends in World History and in the United States. Overall, a very good read.	2002-12-06

His previous novels were central to the old storyline, and I'm sure he will continue in this new age of 'Mech combat. This novel is written in the first person, which is a welcome change, and it seems that Mr. Stackpole enjoyed playing with the character of Sam Donnely. Having read many of Mr. Stackpole's other novels, I found it quite entertaining to see some scenes and ideas from his fantasy novels (i.e. Talion: Revenant). The story introduces the reader to the new Inner Sphere; The Republic, after several generations of peace, is now coming apart at the seams. Sam Donelly finds himself in the middle of this unrest and must use all of his considerable skills to ensure the innocent are not harmed. While the Mech action found in the old Battletech series is not as evident in this novel, the foundation is laid for the general conflagaration that will soon (it seems) envelop the Republic of the Sphere. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. It was well-written and the \\"overly intellectual\\" musings of Sam are quite humorous. Of course, it was good to see Victor Davion make a cameo and soothe those who thought that everything from the old Battletech universe was stripped away. Can't wait for the next novel.	2002-12-04

Included is the version of Ender's Game that appeared in an Analog magazine in 1977 and introduced us to Ender, Buggers, and Battle School. It is a very fun read and it is amazing to see how the story expanded to novel form. A second short story included in the book is called Investment Counselor. This story introduces Jane, Ender's living computer friend, to Ender as he is traveling on a colony ship. Again, the story is short and fun. Finally, the third story in this book is called the Polish Boy. Readers will see Ender's father as a young boy living in noncompliant Poland. A young International Fleet officer named Graff (ring a bell, Ender fans?) plays a role in guiding this young child's future before Ender was even a twinkle in his father's eye. Overall, this book is a good additional collection of information relating to Ender. While not necessary to understand the other novels, they do add tidbits of information that makes the Enderverse all that much more enjoyable. I highly recommend it.

Minobu Tetsuhara is the Combine's liason officer with the Dragoons after House Kurita hires the vaunted mercenaries.  Tetsuhara must learn from the Dragoons as the Coordinator of the Draconis Combine, Takashi Kurita, orders him to create a unit that mimics the Dragoons' style.  Events come to a head when the Coordinator arranges to keep the Dragoons contract and Tetsuhara must choose between facing off with the Dragoons or dishonoring himself as a samurai of the Draconis Combine.  Set before the coming of the Clans and the just-finished FedCom civil war, this is Battletech still at its best (before major word limits cut out the legs of many novels).  Highly enjoyable, especially if you read the Warrior Trilogy, Blood of Kerensky Trilogy, Heir to the Dragon, and Wolf Pack, a sequel to this novel also by Mr. Charrette.	2002-09-04

Having followed the Battletech storyline for over a decade, I must say that I'm sad to see the current plots end. However, Mechwarrior: Dark Age should brighten my spirits. This novel ends the FedCom civil war well. It appears that there was a word limit placed on this book, so alot of action takes place in a very short time. Regardless, Victor and his cadre of close friends must press on towards toppling Katherine. The main action mostly takes place on Tharkad and New Avalon, but all of the major storylines are brought to a conclusion. Some endings are rather abrupt, but adequate. Readers will see what happens to Agents Curaitis and Francesca as they try to find direct evidence of Katherine's involvent in Melissa Steiner's assasination, whether or not Ryan Steiner's, Melissa Steiner's, and Omi Kurita's assasin can pull off yet another escape, and, of course, who wins the FedCom civil war. The stage has been set for the new Mechwarrior series. Hopefully, we will see some of the characters from this generation pop up in the new series, maybe the children of our favorite main characters?

While I've never played the RPG, I've managed to continue collecting and reading all of the novels.  This one, without a doubt, is an excellent novel.  Introducing Aidan Pryde of Clan Jade Falcon, Battletech readers are introduced to the Way of the Clans.  This first volume details how Clan warriors are bred and trained.  We follow Aidan on his exploits through Clan space as he attempts to become a warrior for the Jade Falcons.  Readers are also introduced to Marthe Pryde, who continues to play a role in the current Battletech storyline.  This novel is an excellent bridge into the Battletech universe.  Unfortunately, with Mechwarrior: Dark Age being released, this book is behind the times, but if you can find the Legend of the Jade Phoenix Trilogy, I thoroughly recommend it.

The main characher, Garth One-Eye, comes to the annual event in order to sow some chaos himself and to exact some revenge.  One nice thing about this book was that, originally, you could order away for a MTG card, The Arena.  Overall, this is a very well-written novel with a super story and excellent characters (we do meet Garth again later on in the series).

Steiner and Archer, previously enemies in the civil war, must put aside their differences in order to succeed.

We see Kyle struggling with his morals as he becomes increasingly against Imperial rule and, once he finds out the Imperials killed his father, joins the Rebel Alliance.  The story weaves into the first level of the Dark Forces PC game and concludes with the Rebels obtaining the schematics of the first Death Star.  I recommend the whole Dark Forces series.

This newest volume fits the bill. Loren Coleman does a good job in showing how Victor's forces don't always win and when they do, it's not always pretty.  The loss of one of the BTech characters, though, seemed trite.  Still, it adds a touch of realism to the BTech storyline and will (hopefully) provide some fireworks as the civil war appears to be winding down.  Coleman remains a good author and provides BTech fans with a solid novel continuing the main storyline.  I'm continually pleased to see the continuity between the Davion/Steiner novels over the past 5-10 years.	2002-06-05

The Avengers are ordered to the planet Odessa in order to convince Snord's Irregulars not to renew their contract with Katrina Steiner in the hopes of helping Victor regain control of the splintered FedCom.  The storyline is predictable and Archer reminds me of the characters from the old BTech novel Ideal War with the introduction of the Knights of the Inner Sphere.  We continue to see the growing conflict within the FedCom, but the last few BTech novels seem mostly filler rather than introducing pertinent elements into this storyline. Hopefully, we'll see some more plot development in the next few novels as it appears that the civil war storyline is winding down.  Overall, a good read, but nothing too heavy.  As always, I recommend some of the earlier Michael Stackpole novels for background of the FedCom	2002-06-05

Quite a few famous SW characters take some time to remember Chewbacca as the fierce warrior, loyal family member, and lifelong friend that he was.  Good artwork (poor Luke looks absolutely haggard) lends to the idea that while Chewie may be gone, the war against the Vong continues with no abatement.  It's kinda pricy for its size, but again, it's a nice rememberance of our favorite Wookie.	2002-06-04

Sith	Books	2	2	5	N	Y	Nothing Special	This comic details the story behind the Valley of the Jedi from the Dark Forces computer games and graphic novels. It gives more information about the entire conflict between the Jedi and Sith. The story revolves around three cousins who are transported to the battleground and proceed to follow their different paths. The story itself is rather bland....having read the Dark Forces novel, I can say it provides more information, but it's not really pertinent to the Star Wars storyline....yet. The ending leaves the possibility that we'll see some more of these characters later on, but for the most part, I wouldn't recommend this story on the basis of the plot. The art was ok. It appeared to be more Manga than other Tales books which I didn't particulary care for, but overall, there are some nice shots. If you are really into the Star Wars storyline, it's a nice addition, but otherwise, stick with the novels.	2002-05-29

Quite a few short stories from William Keith, Michael Stackpole, and other authors. The stories are well written and entertaining. You can often find this on ebay and get it  for a relatively decent price.	2000-05-26

DON'T BOTHER. The small tidbits of the story you can glean out of other Battletech books pretty much give you the idea. Poor characterizations of Hanse Davion and Ardan Sortek and a bland story line make this novel a chore to read.  The story discusses House Liao's attempt to insert a double on the throne of the Federated Suns.  Hanse Davion, leader of the Federated Suns, along with Ardan Sortek must stop Liao from succeeding. Stick with Michael Stackpole for good stories about House Davion or Robert Charrette for stories about House Kurita.	2000-05-26

This book details the civil war within the Dragoons during the Clan Truce of Tukayyid. New Dragoons are introduced who will play minor parts in later Battletech novels. Personally, I think Robert Charette ranks pretty high up on the list of good Battletech  authors. Wolves on the Border and Heir to the Dragon are also good books of  his that detail the history of the Dragoons and the Kuritas during earlier  conflicts.	2000-04-02

However, his last couple of books seem to be lacking the depth his earlier works display. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed this  book (as well as  Prince of Havoc).  My only major criticism was that the  story seemed too rushed.  Also, I wish he would focus more on Katherine's  betrayal.  Still, Stackpole is still, in my opinion, the best Battletech  author.	1999-01-06

As expected from the title, Natasha Kerensky (the Black Widow) must work with her unit to avenge the deaths of the murdered Dragoons. The book also comes with a Battletech RPG scenario at the end...a barroom fight of all things. Still, if you can find this, it is a story that helps to further explain the actions of the Dragoons in the Inner Sphere.	1999-01-06

It was much different from other battletech novels in that it involves a lost jump ship crew and the passengers suffer a misjump and arrive at a world populated by an alien species as well as a  group of humans decended from another group who misjumped there several  centuries before.  Fortunately, the newly arrived humans are led by a DEST  commando.  The action usually seen in other battletech books is not here,  but I was still intrigued by the subtle power plays in the novel.  Definately a great book.	1999-01-06

That &quot;loveable&quot; character from the Jade Phoenix Trilogy again graces the Battletech universe with her disdain for authority and bitter cynicism. This time, she has to become a spy in order to unravel a puzzle that could threaten the Clans breeding system. Top that off with a one on one fight with the legendary Natasha Kerensky of the Wolves, and you've got a great book.	1999-01-06

Told before the Clan invasion, it offers a glimpse at the fragmentation of the Inner Sphere, specifically, the War of 3039.  Readers get a reprieve from the mostly pro-Davion storyline to see the development of a major player in the Inner Sphere. Theodore is an excellent character who, as the storyline progresses, continues to be well-developed.	1997-12-15
