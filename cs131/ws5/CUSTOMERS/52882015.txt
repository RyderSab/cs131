His worldview must be staggering. I think his job may be the best one in the world...to travel, develop investment and business insights and then make investments based on those insights. <br />My only complaint is I wish he had written more about his research methods, about what he does in each new place to acquire those insights.<br />And his first-hand observations of where foreign aid really goes is shocking. If George Bush would read this he'd learn how he could stop wasting hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars a year in worthless foreign aid.	2003-05-20

It has nothing to do with monks and zero Zen/spiritual component. But it offers a lot of excellent guidelines/advice and insights about creating fundable web-oriented ventures.

From the promise of the title you expect to be presented with a lucid, logical, intuitive compilation of interesting information. You will be disappointed! The promise is empty. Not that the graphics aren't excellent,  but the dis-organization of the book throws it all off. There is no table  of contents, no index, no page numbers. There are about a dozen sub-tables  of contents buried within the book, but they are a mess as well. Each is  organized by contributor, with endlessly ovelapping topics. While it might  be fun to flip through this from time to time, if you seek to look anything  up, you may have to turn each of the 300 pages to find it. And heaven  forbid you want to mark/refer to an interesting page - without pages  numbers it's rather difficult. I think they should recall all of these and  hire Don Nornam or Ed Tufte to create a thoughtful, intuitive means of  knowing what's in here and how to find it. What were these guys  thinking?  Excellent idea, terrible implementation.	2000-02-12

A great read. Well-researched and well-written, a hard-to-put-down story. Byrne describes a derranged, paranoid, dellusional, incompetent, immoral (and even accused sexual abuser!) manager who managed to fool many people  for decades; how he managed to maintain this pretense through stock options  and stock appreciation. And did he fire a hundred thousand people before  his career ended? Most extraordinary and deeply tragic is how many peoples  lives and families and American companies he destroyed. Is there a town or  city in America where this guy can now walk safely? He seems to be the kind  of person who, were he not in the corporate world, would have been a serial  killer, a mass murderer. Slash and deny - OJ Dunlap?	2000-01-23

But it was pretty disappointing. Based around 9 trite  truisms such as buy low and outmanage the competition, it never tells you  how to achieve this. And the chapters describing each billionaire who is  supposed to exemplify each truism are thin, filled with social commentary  (who cares if Richard Branson throws people into swimming pools?) and few  insights. But the books most glaring void - and the method most accessible  to anyone really wishing to be (or is that become?) a billionaire - is its  failure to focus on a new and certainly proven method of achieving the  titles promise...develop a great internet business idea and take it public.  In that the authors place of business has itself helped create a number of  these makes this omission even more glaring.	2000-01-12

Hardly news now except perhaps to a handful of people living on Fiji without electricity. It does not take a genius to identify a bubble when you see stocks like  Yahoo selling at 2000 times earnings and most others selling at infinity  times losses. What is surprising is that there two insiders waited so long  to write about it. I guess they hoped that by delaying publication of this  book until a top of the internet bubble market seemed imminent, they would  appear brilliant predictors of the the top. In fact they did a disservice;  why did they not begin warning people about the bubble a year ago? They  note in the back of the book that the data - the figures they are using to  demonstrate how inflated net stocks are - is from June, 1999, which is  ancient history in internet time. The book's front page promises to tell  investors what they need to know to avoid the coming shakeout, yet only  once in 283 pages do they actually say SELL NOW.	1999-12-16

By now I think I have read about fifteen of De Bono's books and this is certainly the best. Many of the others seem to be mostly regurgitations of the the same old stuff. Does he get paid by the word? He claims to have  written about 25 books, but I think he has to a great extent written one  book over and over again. And he seems so pompous and arrogant. How can  someone with such arrogance be creative? He never quotes others (perhaps to  him there are no others) or cites other works on creativity, even in cases  where his ideas were clearly not first his. This is an excellent book, but  by an ego-centric author and that unfortunately colors all his writing.	1999-12-06

A well written adventure story, but a very, very disturbing collection of insights into how quietly ill our economy has become. For decades we have read and admired how men of substance have built businesses that made real  contributions to our lives. Henry Ford, Alfred Sloan, John Rockefeller,  Bill Gates, Sam Walton, Jack Welch, Ray Kroc, Carl Djerassi, Jobs &amp;  Wozniak and countless others dedicated their lives to creating great  enterprises that created wonderful products that benefited mankind. And in  turn they received vast well-earned rewards for their contributions. Now  suddenly we have a system that bestows even greater rewards on the subject  of this book, a man variously defined in the book as a psychopath, a maniac  and dysfunctional, and in fact someone who has literally shot himself  through all the toes of his left foot!  He is described as shallow,  childish and destructively implusive, when for example he forces the  premature IPO of Netscape in order to finance his $60 million sailboat or  drives his sportscar at 100 mph. More disturbing is the legion of people  who follow him proclaiming what wonderful clothes this new emperor wears.  This reminds me of the fake Howard Hughes last will &amp; testiment in  which forger names himself along with a hundred people actually close to  Hughes as beneficiaries, knowing that the inclusion of their names will  induce each of them to vet the entire will as genuine. They all know the  will is fake, but by becoming accomplices to the fraud they all benefit.  Michael Lewis paints a picture of how empty so many internet companies are  and how very unlikely it is that most of them will ever achieve  profitability or even survive. And seems to indicate that the present  market cap of those internet companies, on the order of over $400 billion,  is destined to collapse, devastating tens of millions of investors. All in  all, a very scary book	1999-11-04

The cliff hanger  comes at almost the last page when you are told &quot;the company is  starting to make some good money&quot;. It's as if the author left out the  last 2 solid &quot;what happened&quot; chapters. Also, whats with the  fashion commentary? In almost every &quot;scene&quot; each party is  described fashionwise...so and so was dressed in blue jeans, a somber black  shirt and an oversize big silver buckle...who cares! The books cover  promises to tell you how a band of physicists made a fortune on Wall  Street, and you never learn if they did. It was a fascinating read, just  wish it had an ending.	1999-10-22
