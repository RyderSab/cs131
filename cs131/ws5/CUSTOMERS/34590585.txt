For him it is simply terrible for a teacher to just tell you something (that you didn't know). If you take his premise to be fact, you shouldn't be reading his books, or any other books either, because they are a form of direct instruction, and direct instruction is bad.  <br /> <br />Kohn mentions (in the reference notes) one teacher complaining that students weren't interested in the subject matter (history, current events) because they said they  \\"wouldn't need the information in their future jobs\\" and trots out the tired argument of schools being nothing more than preparation for the workplace.  <br /> <br />What's wrong with that argument? Simple. It is the TEACHER who has total control over making a subject interesting or not. ANY subject can be interesting if the right teacher is teaching it. We have too many non-math and non-science teachers teaching those subjects, and it shows! As for history, look at how many Civil War reenactors there are, not to mention the success of Renaissance Faires and organizations such as the SCA (Society for Creative Anachronism). If a teacher were to use those examples for the basis of a lesson, you would have interested students. <br /> <br />Also, one major drawback to his book is that he doesn't seem to have any notion of what children should be learning as far as any kind of body of knowledge. What should our children be learning? <br /> <br />Bottom line, I found that his book seemed to be a much better argument for homeschooling, and unschooling in particular, rather than sending your children to any public or private school. I did agree with him about programs like Book It! and Accelerated Reader being terrible, but for me the reason is that these programs promote junk books and TV/movie tie-in books instead of classic, challenging literature.	2005-10-06

This book has very interesting and unconventional ideas for getting you to think about how you are going to realize your hopes and dreams.  <br /> <br />Her own career trek started back in the late 60's (my book has a copyright date of 1979, and in the introduction as well as the chapter entitled \\"Brainstorming\\", she says she started over in New York city \\"11 years ago\\") where she essentially talked her way into a job as a counselor in a drug program, and things got better from there.  <br /> <br />Now, 'way back then, that sort of job was likely not licensed or overseen in any way, so she could get away with that sort of thing.  You might have gotten a few hours of \\"training\\", but mostly you learned on the job. It is a similar career path for those who volunteer their way into full-time employment (another tactic she also mentions in the same chapter).  Current analogies are probably \\"weight loss counselor\\", \\"career counselor\\" or \\"life coach\\", none of which require any credentials to speak of. Just put out your shingle, and go for it. <br /> <br />The other situation where credentials don't matter so much is if you are a pioneer in your field (think Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, etc.). In that case YOU are the one setting the standards. <br /> <br />Even though her book's dust jacket calls her one, I would never consider the author a \\"therapist\\" in the way people generally think of the word, which is usually in conjunction with \\"licensed\\", since she says she's never taken any other classes than those required for her BA in Anthropology. It does refer to her as a \\"career counselor\\", which is much more accurate. <br /> <br />The other thing I found odd was that her book seemed to be just chock full of of people who had these great connections to people and things. Well, that is a lot more likely in some large cosmopolitan city like New York than it is in your typical small town. Something to think about when you have the get-togethers she recommends in order to generate ideas. Today, you would be better off going online. <br /> <br />Bottom line, it is a good book with creative ideas, but take what she says with a grain of salt. If your chosen path requires a degree or some sort of certification by law, you'd better get one, or you will get in trouble at some point when it catches up with you. On the other hand, if you want to be an artist, or do something new and groundbreaking, you have a lot more latitude as to how you go about attaining your goal.	2005-09-14
US	34590585	R22ZOCOBVN0I26	0941355195	812718453	Math: Facing an American Phobia	Books	3	4	7	N	N	Interesting, but not convincing regarding calculator use in elementary school	I found her book to have some interesting ideas of how to go about solving certain types of math problems, especially if they are presented as alternative explanations for students who don't get it on the first try. Not everyone understands concepts in the same way. <br /> <br />However, she completely fails to convince in her chapter regarding calculator use in the early grades.  How do you know if your calculator is malfunctioning if you can't do the math yourself? Shouldn't all students be held to certain minimum standards of mental calculation? She doesn't even mention Trachtenberg math, for example, the mastery of which would be quite useful in day-to-day activities such as making sure you have enough cash when shopping. The main trouble with calculators is that once you start using them, you stop using your brain, and the brain is a like a muscle, when you stop using it, it atrophies. <br /> <br />And, while I agree with her use of \\"real-life\\" examples, she proved with her own hand lotion purchase why it is important to have excellent mental computational skills, which would not be affected by being \\"in a rush\\" (that was the excuse she used, anyway). <br /> <br />Finally, she also illustrated why so many are \\"turned off\\" by math, although it certainly wasn't intentional on her part. One of her examples involved drawing a square, then drawing a square twice the area. Left as it is, it is a boring problem, a definite \\"so what\\" type of thing. Most math word problems are of this type, in fact, and if you're at all disinterested, you are not motivated to want to bother with it, especially if you also happen to not like math in the first place. <br /> <br />Well, WHY would anyone want to waste time doing that just for its own sake?  Now, if you are designing a house, for example, or think you might in the future, this suddenly becomes a useful, interesting problem. However, she just leaves it as it was above, so good luck in trying to get anyone excited about solving it.  In a related chapter, she talks about people using tip tables, as opposed to figuring a tip mentally. It probably never occurred to her that people resist figuring a tip because they perhaps resent having to leave one (or at least being pressured to feel as if they do) at all.  <br /> <br />She seems to emphasize a lot of group work. Well, in the REAL world (other than in her small classroom world), you need to know how to do your work all by yourself. The SATs don't allow working in a group, and they are timed tests. YOU will need to know how to calculate the rates of return on your retirement portfolio, and how to double-check your end-of-year mortgage statements. You aren't always going to have your friends or math teacher around to call up and ask. <br /> <br />Bottom line: an interesting book, but veers into the \\"feel good\\" mode 'way too much.   Like other teachers (of all subjects, not just math), she could use more time in the real world, and less time in the world of academe.	2005-09-13
US	34590585	R3MV9OM8YSSNWL	0385484577	432234324	The Schools We Need and Why	Books	2	28	48	N	Y	Best thing about this book is the glossary	While Hirsch does a good job of listing most of the trends in public school education, he does a truly dismal job of explaining why they don't work. In fact, even though I lean towards more traditional learning, I thought he was so off base with his reasons as to *why* this or that educational technique doesn't work, that actually I found I agreed in several cases with his opponents, which I don't think was the aim of his book, lol. <br /> <br />For example, he doesn't like project-based learning, or cooperative (small group) education. He feels they're inefficient. Well, they're not inefficient if done correctly, where each student is assigned an equally difficult and important task, and the teacher keeps on top of things, individually grading each student independently of the project, and the students in the group are similar in terms of intelligence, skill, and work ethic.  <br /> <br />However, what *really* happens, and why they don't work (which he does not mention) is that most teachers use these techniques during class as babysitting devices so they can grade papers or do other paperwork or go on break. The smarter and/or harder working students, because they don't want their grades to suffer, end up doing all of the work and the slackers skate by with a good grade because the teacher only grades the total project. The smarter students also wind up actually teaching the other students for a good deal of the school day, which gee, I thought that was what TEACHERS are paid to do.  <br /> <br />He even fails to list that the best reason to continue with the \\"traditional\\" classroom where teacher talks and students listen is that it is often the most efficient way to get information across to large groups of people. How could he miss that?   <br /> <br />He mentions that in Asian classrooms students are typically given an overview of exactly what they will learn in a class session. Well, go to any seminar and probably 95% of them are taught that way, because youhave really large groups of people and only one instructor. Most lower-division college classes (especially those held in large auditoriums) are taught this way.  <br /> <br />However, these classes only work if students are well-behaved (often not the case in K-12) and everyone in the class is assumed to have the ability to learn the new information with little or no follow-up (which again is often not the case in K-12). In these types of classes, the teacher (or indeed, anyone who can read the lesson plan) simply presents the information, which is hardly \\"teaching\\", by any stretch of the imagination.  <br /> <br />The chief value in this book lies primarily in the glossary, which provides a wealth of buzzwords for the homeschooling parent to jazz up any district-required homeschool record-keeping.	2005-08-30

The author totally dismisses any such notion that one could simply be eating too much.  While it is obvious that having certain attitudes can make you ignore what and how much you're eating, the fact remains that one is overweight from eating too much for one's particular body.  <br /> <br />If you want things and people to blame your overweight on, this book is chock-full of them. Yes, you're supposed to forgive everyone, but you definitely get a \\"victim mentality\\" while reading the book. Whatever happened to personal responsibility? <br /> <br />This author is a big fan of \\"rebirthing\\", and mentions it several times throughout the book. If you're not into New Age beliefs, this is not the book for you. <br /> <br />Borrow from the library first.	2005-08-30

Don't get me wrong, I love his shows, although I think his rooms are somewhat overfilled with stuff. His built-ins and projects are great! <br /> <br />However, unless you've taped his shows, the instructions for the few projects he did include (l really would have liked the instructions for the desk in the kid's race car room but it wasn't there--looked very \\"Jetsons\\") leave a LOT to be desired. And instead of nice pictures of the entire room and full furniture layouts, you got a lot of his drawings over the color pictures. <br /> <br />So, bottom line, you cannot just pick up this book and hope to do this stuff without watching the particular episodes he's referring to.  <br /> <br />I hope future books are written to correct this problem (present in all the books except his entertaining book), and also that he puts out a book with ALL of the projects he builds in it, with good instructions and lots of pictures.	2005-08-23

This book consists of lots of tips, think Martha Stewart's \\"Good Things\\" but with no pictures. Most of the tips don't need pictures, but some tips definitely could have used them. The tips are all over the map and not necessarily decorating related. <br /> <br />I'm sure I wasn't the only one hoping for more \\"before and after\\" room arrangement pictures, but you're not going to get any in this book.  <br /> <br />In a way, it suffers from a sense of being old-fashioned, as when she suggests putting a desk behind a sofa, and not facing it against the wall. Well, unless you are willing to spend big bucks to re-wire and re-carpet to hide electrical cords, you are NOT going to put a desk facing the middle of a room any more because of the tripping hazard, since even if you do bundle the cords up, they still have to be plugged into an outlet. What she suggests might work for the \\"kiddie table\\" that lots of people have in their living room, but no sofa is going to \\"hide\\" your computer, printer, etc. She seems to be oblivious to the idea of the modern home desk with the need to plug in the computer, printer, modem, phone, task light, etc.--the days of the executive desk with nothing on it but perhaps a blotter and pen are LONG gone. <br /> <br />I liked this book, but not in the same way as her first book. I did not really see it as a follow-up to her first book, but really a totally different book. I hope she writes another book that is a true follow-up to her first book, dealing with all the other rooms she left out.	2005-08-23

Her examples show REAL homes with odd, mismatched furniture. Clear before and after pictures and floor plans, even if they are in black and white. She has some good rules of thumb to at least think of, which you may or may not agree with, and tends toward the neutral (white/beige) as far as paint--you can always add color with your choice of furnishings and art. She tells you which one should win out between beautiful view and fireplace when you have both in a room. <br /> <br />The bad: Most of it is about living rooms, and she apparently assumes that you are doing a  good deal of formal entertaining there. There are virtually no ideas for people who use their living rooms for anything else, e.g. home office, exercise room, playroom, etc. Not everyone entertains in their house--some have backyard BBQs, and others entertain at restaurants or the local park.  <br /> <br />Where I disagreed with her:  If you have a library of books that you actually use, you would never organize them by size, you would organize them by subject/author, except of course for your truly oversized books. Pillows on sofas--hmmm. I think you can use them on futons or sofas with hard armrests, but on your typical overstuffed sofa, they're overkill. Would rather see a nice handmade afghan. <br /> <br />To the critics who were upset that she \\"ignored\\" the TV: It is an etiquette thing, actually. The TV is not supposed to be more important than your guests, and she is by no means the only decorator who says to hide the TV in an armoire or better yet, put it in another room. These days a lot of the newer homes have dedicated \\"home theater\\" type rooms, anyway--with a less-expensive alternative being a spare bedroom. <br /> <br />Besides, if you're having a Superbowl party or some such TV-related event, it would be smarter to have a TV in the kitchen/family room area where hopefully there is no carpet, and nothing furniture-wise that could be ruined by food.  <br /> <br />Bottom line: This book has a lot of useful ideas for furniture arranging, geared primarily to the living room and family room, but you can also use them as a jump-off point for rearranging other rooms. Some good ideas for some of the other rooms, like dining rooms you don't use because your kitchen is plenty big enough to eat in. I thought this book was much, much better than Decorating for Good by Carol Talbott.	2005-08-23

So how does she get the furniture in--drop it down from the ceiling area?      Not one picture illustrates how to arrange furniture around design features such as a fireplace in between two large picture windows, or glass doors that most newer houses have these days, or large walkthrough archways, just to name a few room challenges that many people have.  Also, most of the groupings did not seem to allow for comfortable passageways for people to get from one end of the room to the other--the rooms were overcrowded with furniture.    I'm glad I borrowed this from the library and didn't buy it. Not recommended.	2005-08-21

I liked both the recipes and his \\"party notes\\" at the beginning of the book--a lot of useful information. The recipes are a good compromise between cooking gourmet and just bringing something from the Costco Deli Section style of entertaining. <br /> <br />The tablescapes--I can see going to all that effort for something very special, like a wedding (if you're doing that in lieu of a gift), but for normal get-togethers they're too much work. For sit-down dinners,  I don't know about you, but I like to see the people I'm talking and eating with, not look through a virtual forest, or glassware, or whatever. For a buffet, they might be nice, if you took what he put on ONE table and spread it out over THREE tables--yes, that is how much stuff is on the table.... <br /> <br />Even the table ideas I did like looked like they were all geared towards parties where you were being served by waitstaff. There was no room on his tables to pass anything around \\"family style\\", which is a concern if that is how most of your dinners are. <br /> <br />Bottom line:  It really depends on the type of people you have at your parties/get togethers. If you have Martha-types, they will ooh and aahh and you might get something out of all that work on the tablescapes. If the people you entertain are more practical and down-to-earth, get this book for the recipes.	2005-08-21

The last chapter of this book has some good ideas for positive thinking for yourself. The rest of the book will infuriate you, because she claims that EVERYTHING bad that happens is our own fault because we have negative feelings about other things.     If you accept that premise as it applies to you and you alone, it's one thing--for example, you made some bad choices in life and now you have no money, have an addiction or have some other issues. But to say that it's your fault you were rear-ended on the freeway because your negative feelings attracted the person who rear-ended you.....good grief. And world tragedies, too, are all caused by negative feelings--just an asinine opinion on her part.    Even her examples of what to do didn't come across as realistic. If you apply what she says, you *should* be able to \\"feel\\" yourself thin. But even she says you have to still go to the gym and work out.     The author's first book, Beyond the Twelve Steps, thanks in the \\"Acknowledgments\\" people who \\"channel\\" such \\"beings\\" as Seth, Ramtha, Zarathustra, Mafu, and Rajni. That tells you right there where she's coming from. They are *not* mentioned in this book, but by the way she mentions God here and there, it is obvious that she is not doing so in a religious sense, but only to make the book appeal to a more mainstream audience.    You cannot \\"feel\\" your way out of problems. You can change your attitude about them, see them as challenges, and work out solutions from there, but just \\"feeling\\" good thoughts is not going to change the bank's mind about foreclosing on your house if you don't pay your mortgage.    Borrow it from your library, for the last chapter only.	2005-08-18

She has some good chore charts that are organized by the age of the child. Some very good room ideas too, but they're not always easy to find in the chapters. <br /> <br />However, some of her ideas on things other than cleaning are just bizarre.  <br /> <br />For instance, she discusses carpools in great detail, even going so far as to say you should inquire about insurance levels of all the drivers. Well, gee, if you're going to do that, shouldn't you go as far as getting driving records from DMV too?  And if you're really that worried about it, should you be doing the carpool thing at all?  <br /> <br />And, be forewarned, this author has apparently never lived outside of a large metropolitan city, because for her, cell phones are a fact of life--she apparently has never lived nor traveled where there is no coverage. She is so dependent upon them, that when there was a minor injury to a friend's child, had practically a panic attack when she couldn't reach the parents (either didn't have the phone with them or turned it off). Cell phones are not foolproof, folks--they stop working, there are areas with no coverage, people turn them off, people leave them behind in the car or at home, people actually choose to ignore the ring, really! For someone so \\"organized\\", in this situation she came across as fairly helpless. Hopefully she learned her lesson and has a signed medical release form for her friend's kids somewhere, or better yet, taken a Red Cross First Aid class. <br /> <br />If she stuck to the cleaning issues only, the book is okay, although she seems very into disposable anti-bacterial wipes. Her other advice, well, it's good for a laugh. Buy used, after checking it out of the library first.	2005-08-16

NOT in this 5th edition.<br /><br />They are in the EARLIER editions (little 3 1/2\\" squares that you can either cut out and laminate or make copies and paste onto 3x5 index cards if you don't want to ruin the book).

You have to go to their site to buy a recording.<br /><br />As to whether the 5th edition is an improvement over the previous editions, I have mixed feelings. Yes, there is more \\"teaching info\\", such as the dialogues the teacher should use (which you may not bother with if you homeschool), but in some ways it makes it more difficult to actually get to the lessons per se.  The word list is extended. It still uses their \\"clock method\\" of teaching handwriting, which makes for that very round, old-fashioned \\"school\\" look. Many schools now teach D'Nealian, which supposedly is easier to transition to cursive handwriting later (imho, they should teach Italic calligraphy instead). It still has samples of the notebook pages, but in a different part of the book than where the teaching dialogues are (again, they assume that this book/system is being used in a classroom, and you have the laminated posters, as well as laminated flashcards for everyone). The earlier editions have the full-size sample pages right next to the actual lesson.<br /><br />I actually felt it necessary, after buying the 5th edition AND after borrowing an earlier edition from my library, to buy one of the earlier editions (4th) used on Amazon in order to get the flashcards and the recording, as well as to more easily understand the lessons, because in the earlier editions the information is more or less presented and you move on, as opposed to being discussed at length as it is in the 5th edition.<br /><br />Also, I was disappointed that the 5th edition, unlike previous editions, is printed on newsprint (it resembles a smaller phonebook both in heft and feel when you turn the pages) and not on better quality paper--I'm skeptical as to how long it will last over time, and with what is essentially a reference textbook, you want something that will last for more than one child.<br /><br />Bottom line: the system is great. However, this 5th edition seems to really be written for classroom teaching--I feel that for homeschooling parents and someone learning on his own, that they would be well-advised to get an earlier edition (4th or 3rd) with the floppy record if you have access to a record player.

Whether she's talking plastic and chemicals, or bones and calcium, the wrong spelling was used throughout the book.  Annoying.   <br /> <br />Also irritating was the constant repetition of how bad plastic is, and her recommendation to use glass containers. Well, it's obvious they don't live with children on a regular basis, or people who may have trouble with their hands and would more easily drop heavy glass bottles. <br /> <br />And please note that even if you are able to reduce your trash to zero or close to it (I remember watching on  \\"Escape from Affluenza\\" a story of a couple who lived that way), in most cities you would still be charged for trash service, regardless.  Until there is some real benefit to people, most will not do it just for the warm fuzzies. <br /> <br />Throughout the book, declarations are made without any source material for one to check out, as though this is all \\"common knowledge\\" to everyone. There are some websites listed, and a short reading list, but that's it, few footnotes to speak of. <br /> <br />On the good side, most of the recipes at least look like they're worth trying, although after reading her book it is surprising that she is not a Raw Food proponent.  I was disappointed that there were not more recipes, and why, after spending page after page explaining what was bad, she didn't spend a paragraph or two explaining why we *should* buy spirulina or other green powder.  And, if we're supposed to avoid excess sodium, why would you ever use a bouillon cube, even if it is vegetarian? <br /> <br />Bottom line, check this out of the library first if you're thinking of buying it. The first two parts of the book are very strident in tone, and quite repetitive. The recipes do not have any nutritional information of any kind listed, so you're on your own figuring things out there, as well as a serving size. She recommends \\"what you can hold in two hands\\", which of course will vary from person to person, and she didn't indicate whether you leveled the top or not....	2005-08-14

Don't get me wrong, I love her shows, it is great to see how she pulls it all together in the 30 minutes without seeming rushed. The recipes, for the most part, are pretty healthy and have good variety. The lack of pictures doesn't bother me, as she's not really into foo-foo presentation with raspberry sauce swirled half-a-mile away on the edge of the dessert plate, imho totally wasting perfectly good raspberry sauce....    However, her books are *not* written to really go with the flow of her show, as in total meals being prepared at the same time.     The recipes, while grouped together as a menu, are all written separately, just like in other cookbooks. So, if you're looking to see what you should be doing *while* the water is boiling or something else is cooking, you're not going to get any help from her books, which is disappointing.     Believe it or not, it takes organization and good time management skills to get everything on the table hot (or cold, as the case may be) at the same time. Her shows do an excellent job of this--the books do not. She needs to look at redoing her books in both formats--recipes all being prepared at the same time to match her show, as well as the more conventional way if you want to mix and match. Then I would buy them.     In the meantime, watch the shows and take notes to get the process down, then get the books from the library or used from Amazon.	2005-08-12

However, I was looking for a decent updated version. This is not it--I'm glad I borrowed it from the library first.  <br /> <br />There is one chapter dealing with PDAs and other organizing devices, and how they might impact your organizational style, but the info was pretty obvious--if you're an \\"everything out\\", visually oriented-type person, a PDA is just not going to do it for you--you're better off with a conventional planner or wall calendar. <br /> <br />So, buy the book, but the earlier edition is just as good if you can get it cheaper.	2005-08-12

And you will need that energy as you hike through the woods or wherever. <br /> <br />On the other hand, when you're at home sitting at the computer, you do not need so much energy. However, your mind still thinks it \\"should\\" have a certain amount of food, weight-wise. So what Volumetrics does is help to reconcile what your mind would like (a full dish of something), with what your body needs (salad or soup or a healthy-prepared entree). This is not to say that you shouldn't still practice portion control, but if you eat more of the \\"calorie bargain\\" foods, you can still have decent portions (not the miniscule portions they show in pictures) of the good ice cream or chocolate or cheese when you like. <br /> <br />The Volumetrics Eating Plan is better, but this one is still good for the \\"science behind the plan\\".	2005-08-10

This one also has some color pictures to liven things up. <br /> <br />The recipes are pretty decent, although they seem to be heavy on the bell peppers (as are a lot of diet books). The menu plans she offers are pretty good, as well as the charts. My other small complaint is that she seems to favor traditional \\"diet\\" foods instead of showing how you can cut the fat and sugar content without resorting to chemically laden substitutes. You can do this yourself, when you decide how much fat/sugar/bread you do want to allow in your meal plans, but hints could have been included in this book. For example, instead of a fat-free blue cheese dressing, loaded with corn syrup, put some crumbled blue cheese into a vinaigrette.	2005-08-09

For the reviewer claiming the ideas were \\"obvious\\", well, no one can possibly know everything. Any book you read will have ideas that may or may not be \\"new to you\\". <br /> <br />Some ideas do seem dated, when the publication date is so recent, like file cards and Rolodexes where many would use PDAs or other devices. On the other hand, if you are the type who doesn't trust computers because you've had a data crash, or you just prefer paper files, actual address books and so forth, there are several good ideas here. For people who organize visually (use bulletin boards and clear files on the desk), this is not a bad book. <br /> <br />My biggest gripe with the book is that she mentioned a lot of helpful organizing products that are either unavailable, or available only through retailers, as opposed to ordering direct from a company. And the products were mentioned throughout the book, so it could have used a separate \\"product source\\" appendix.	2005-08-08

I was disappointed in this volume. It is nice to see the copies of the original newsletters as they appeared, but I was hoping for much better as far as rewriting the patterns for those who prefer more conventional directions (line by line) in general, or those who do not like to lose their place in paragraph-type instructions. The EPS system, for example could easily have been re-written in a \\"formula\\", fill-in-the-blank fashion. In fact, for a more easily understood version of the EPS system, get The Sweater Workshop by Jacqueline Fee. <br /> <br />Most of the patterns here have some \\"updating\\" notes, but even there the directions are on the sparse side.  Some more current techniques, like circular Brioche (called Prime Rib in this book), are not even mentioned, and they could have easily been added as updates. <br /> <br />The pictures are okay, not great. Several seem to be in shadow, at least one is blurry, and some are not marked as to exactly which item or item with which variation is being pictured. The color pictures, unfortunately are not near the actual directions, so you have to spend time flipping back and forth. Many of the people in the pictures are in moving poses, which make it extra difficult to see construction details. <br /> <br />Bottom line: if you are an EZ fan and simply have to have all the books, get it, there are some journal entries and other commentary that may be of interest to you as well as the patterns. If you have other EZ books and have had trouble following her style of directions in the past, this one isn't any better--have your library buy it, or get a glimpse of it at your local yarn store or independent bookstore before buying. If you have to spend time rewriting the patterns to make them more readable and useful to you, the almost $30 price tag is pretty steep, considering that most of this is old material, much of it in her other books.	2005-08-07

This was a quick read (one evening), and if you wanted to know about sororities in general, it was quite interesting. These organizations make tons of money off the intellectually challenged people who join them. Why anyone would pay good money to go through the hazing and such written about in this book is beyond me. <br /> <br />However, I think some reviewers make good points about the drinking/drug/sex problems not being confined to sororities and frat houses--I would say they're an issue with dorm life, period, due to a lack of quality mature adult role models. You don't see that stuff at commuter schools, especially when you're in classes with students who are commuting from home, and re-entry students, both of  whom just go straight home from class because they have a job and/or family waiting for them. <br /> <br />The weakest part of this book are the stories of the individual girls, which as one reviewer pointed out, are boring because they are repetitive. It jumps around from chapter to chapter, and they all seem to have the same problems with guys, mean girls, etc. Even Sabrina, who was held up by the author as the \\"best\\" of the four, smoked dope (gee, why do you think they call it that?), which seemed to contradict the author's assertion that these were all \\"nice\\" girls. As a parent, would you want your children hanging out with any of these girls or guys? No thanks. <br /> <br />I would have preferred that the quotes/references be listed at the end of the chapters rather than at the back of the book. It was irritating having to go back and forth to read them. <br /> <br />If you know anyone who is thinking about joining or having their daughters join a sorority, have them read this book first.	2005-08-07

This is a 3.5 star book. 5-stars if you live/work in an area where people pay more attention to your clothes than how well you do your job and/or you go to a lot of formal functions. 1-2 stars if you are a work/stay-at-home parent looking to upgrade your wardrobe a bit. <br /> <br />Good points:  Clear descriptions of types of dress for various situations, including business casual (always a tricky one). Clear steps on how to \\"shop in your closet\\" and reorganize it. Some good forms in the back to help you keep track of what you have and what you need to shop for. Pictures of some clothing styles, types of shoes, etc., all line drawings, there are no color photos in the book anywhere. Good plan for what to do when you're at the store, and what to look for in good dressing rooms. Lots of suggestions for accessories, as well as what to keep in your office for the occasional clothing emergency. <br /> <br />Bad points:  Not enough on seasonal dressing for your climate--she assumes that everyone has (or should have) 4 full seasons' worth of clothes. Ahem(!)  In for example, Southern California, you pretty much have dry season and wet season. Northern California, and the Pacific Northwest, you need some clothing for cold weather, but hardly a \\"season's\\" worth, and so on. And trenchcoats are great for cities with sidewalks, or where you drive up in a car and get dropped of at the curb and never touch dirt or grass.  For people in climates where it only occasionally gets cold, one or two coats and perhaps a nice wrap is plenty. <br /> <br />Occasional silly rules like \\"no straw hats after Labor Day\\" which perhaps apply to New York and points north (the author lives in Boston), where it gets cold in the autumn, but not in Southern California, or other states where summer-type weather extends well into November. She also doesn't like athletic shoes with business wear while commuting. It apparently doesn't occur to her that perhaps people wear them for comfort (because they have to stand for an hour or longer on the train or bus) and safety (never know when you might have to run from a mugger). Very few formal/work shoes are truly comfortable and safe to run in (or even walk fast). When they make such things, people will buy them, until then, it is athletic shoes. <br /> <br />Relies too much on black as the basis of a wardrobe. Black is great on many people, but by no means everyone. She says people \\"don't remember\\" black. If you wear any color to excess, people will remember it.  <br /> <br />I didn't see her advice so much as \\"dated\\"; instead, it seemed very \\"back east\\" and corporate-oriented, and it helped if you have tons of money to spend.  <br /> <br />She insists that everyone needs at least one suit. If you do not work in any outside job, \\"business casual\\" will carry you through everything except a true formal occasion. You're much better off spending money on quality separates. She is very into \\"power dressing\\" and it gets annoying after a while if you're the type of person who pays attention to the person, not the clothing.  <br /> <br />Bottom line, a good book if you live back east, or in your very large cities where at least some people pay attention to fashion. For the rest of us, some good sound info, but you have to wade through some annoying attitudes to get to it.  And there are mistakes in the index.  A good companion book would be Does This Make Me Look Fat? by Leah Feldon, which has more and better line drawings and better ideas for what to look for to make the most of your figure, whatever size it is.	2005-08-05

Since I was curious after reading all the great reviews, I borrowed this book from the library. It is a pretty good book, but not worth the high prices they're asking on the used market unless it's autographed. <br /> <br />Good Points: Empasizes paring down your closet so that every piece you have works; lets you know it's okay to have a favorite outfit in more than one color or fabric (i.e. a \\"uniform\\" so to speak). Comes down on the fashion industry as part of the reason women don't look as good as they could in clothing (wouldn't be surprised at all if this is the reason the book is out of print). Emphasizes putting together \\"outfits\\" in your closet, as opposed to hanging your separates in sections (although if you do this paring down right, thinking of your entire closet as a travel wardrobe, then everything should go with everything, regardless of what you pull out). Great section on how to take care of your clothes. <br /> <br />Bad:  No pictures, unless you count caricatures of the authors. No real descriptions on how to dress to cover figure flaws, just an occasional mention of some of the camouflage dressing of the authors.  <br /> <br />It's a small, mass-market paperback and almost half of the book is repetition and/or fluff.  One example is when they say that one reason to shop is to replace a proven (i.e. \\"workhorse\\") wardrobe item. An entire paragraph is spent explaining why one of the authors replaced a black turtleneck with a cashmere one after being dissatisfied with cheaper ones. Who cares?  <br /> <br />Even though this book talks about personal style, as do other books, the authors seem to think that everyone is passionate about style--believe me, not everyone is. Some of us want to look good, but have better things to do with our time and money than spend it on clothing. Some things like comfort and ease of care are important to us. <br /> <br />Bottom line: 95% of what is in this book (including \\"capsule\\" or outfit dressing\\" is in other books,although this one does a decent job of condensing it into a compact form (but it could be smaller and then even more useful).  I think the title is a misnomer, because none of their exercises is difficult to do. Get it from your library, if you can. <br /> <br />Until this book is back in print, I would suggest the following books: <br /> <br />Does This Make Me Look Fat?   by Leah Feldon <br />Brenda's Wardrobe Companion   by Brenda Kinsel <br />I Don't Have a Thing to Wear   by Judie Taggart, Jackie Walker <br />Ready to Wear   by Mary Lou Andre <br /> <br />and if you need color pictures: <br /> <br />The Lucky Shopping Manual by Andrea Linett	2005-08-04

There are many clear line drawings, which are very helpful. <br /> <br />As to mentioning wearing black, and some reviewers seeing that as \\"dated\\", most of the new books out still say to have that \\"little black dress/outfit\\" too. If you don't like black (I don't because it requires more care to avoid the color fading), wear some other dark or medium color as your main color.  <br /> <br />For the reviewer who was dismayed at the tone of the book, well, the title accurately describes the purpose of the book, which is to dress for the figure you have.  Not everyone is wrapped up in size issues, but they DO want to buy the clothes that will flatter their figure. I did not see the book as condescending in any way, just matter-of-fact in its presentation. <br /> <br />The celebrity quotes are kind of dumb, but thankfully don't detract from the rest of the book.	2005-08-03

I wanted to rate this book 3 1/2 stars.   <br /> <br />While it is true that virtually nothing in this book could be considered \\"new\\" as in groundbreaking, it is the way he presents the information systematically that makes all the difference between his book and all the other diet books out there. His plan is sound, and it does take into consideration that perhaps some of us would rather eat spinach than bell peppers, if we do have to eat our vegetables. <br /> <br />However, what keeps this from being 5 stars: <br /> <br />1. No end-of-chapter summaries, which would have been extremely helpful. <br /> <br />2. The index is not that great. You cannot, for example, look up specific notebook exercises, and would be well-advised to make up your own location list for them. It would be nice if this oversight were remedied in the next edition. <br /> <br />3. I was surprised he would steer someone towards buying several different types of low-cal/low-fat ice cream, rather than suggest something healthier like a frozen fruit bar or a sorbet. Often you just want something cold, not necessarily rich in fat. And he mentions in one appendix how great this one product is, despite having some coconut oil in it (an ice cream product), yet fails to mention that by making some of these treats (and indeed other foods)  yourself, you can cut out a lot of the fat/sugar, yet still have a great-tasting food. <br /> <br />4. In line with #3 above, I was somewhat disappointed that even though he often pointed out that so-called \\"fat-free\\" foods have just as many calories (or more) as their fatty cousins, he also tended to recommend \\"calorie-bargain\\" substitutes that could also be objectionable due to their ingredients. A lot of low-cal foods are chemical-laden, and to use another example, even if you are an ovo-lacto vegetarian, you are still not going to want gelatin in your food. So, reading the labels for nutrition information is not enough--you will also want to check the ingredientlist as well, especially if you go the substitution route, as opposed to real portion control.  <br /> <br />5. His suggestions for restaurant eating made it not worth the effort to eat out. Here's a better solution: order whatever you want, along with a take-home container. Immediately package up 1/2 or 2/3 of your meal for yourself the next day, or give the container to your friend or another family member to take home. <br /> <br />6. The book could have been written in a more organized fashion. Good tidbits of information are buried in the middle of long paragraphs, which makes it hard to refer back to the book for specifics. <br /> <br />Bottom line, buy this book.  Dr. Barbara Rolls (of Volumetrics fame) wrote an introduction, and in addition to her book I would also recommend reading Dr. Shapiro's Picture Perfect Guide to Weight Loss books. He too falls into the \\"Frankenfood\\" substitution trap from time to time, but his books with their photos dovetail nicely with the Calorie Bargain/Calorie Rip-Off concept in this one.	2005-08-03

Because of this it is frustrating to go through the book at times. There are those who think Elizabeth Zimmermann was somewhat smug--this woman makes her look positively humble!   <br /> <br />Some of the patterns are variations (lots of cat beds, which may or may not be to your taste, or worth knitting, and several sling bags), so they seemed more like \\"filler\\".  The \\"knitter's bowl\\" is the best pattern, and would make an interesting desk organizer or a really cool gift basket, or portable nightstand for a guest. The \\"tentacle hat\\" is definitely a novelty item, and something you might wear to the SF Bay-to-Breakers race, or some other fun run. <br /> <br />So, buy the book, but go in with a friend, or buy and donate it to your library. I think this book is somewhat better than the first treasury, since if you have to choose between the two, it does have the basic the basic moebius instructions also.	2005-07-21

He has some useful ideas, but in most cases his solutions are not practical. Maybe people would have better luck if they could choose their own rewards? <br /> <br />I think most of us would agree that people should do things for the \\"right\\" reasons, but  what if they don't agree with your reasons? Let's use the example of cleaning your room. Why should you make your bed? Or clean your room? \\"So it looks nice\\", might work for some. \\"So you can find your stuff when you need to\\", might work for others. But we all know clutterbugs that can actually find things just as quickly as the neatnik. So you either ignore the mess (that is, adjust your attitude), or if you really want to change the behavior, find a reward that works for that particular person.  <br /> <br />As far as school and grades go, you need some sort of system in order to objectively evaluate someone's performance. Are you getting someone who was in the top 10% of their class, or someone who just scraped by? Maybe grades only in the actual field of study, with all electives taken on a pass/fail basis for \\"enrichment\\" only. Part of the trouble with motivating students is that the schools fail to explain why something needs to be learned in manner that students can relate to. If you don't want to work in computers when you get out of school, taking more math is just a waste of time, and you will never have the internal motivation to do well. <br /> <br />In the world of work, maybe if all companies were owned/run by the employees, things might be different, because all would share the same goal of success. But, as long as that is the exception, and not the rule, we will continue to have motivation and reward issues. For some, it is the 3M Principle (Money Motivates Me). For others, it will be benefits (on-site child care, you can bring your dog to work, etc.). Even people who *love* their jobs also want to be paid. <br /> <br />So, this book presents the problem in great detail, but no real solutions. Checkout of the library first.	2005-07-19

There is a little information that is useful that could be contained in a 2-3 page magazine article, but it is buried in a lot of repetitious fluff.  <br /> <br />Several things irritated me: 1) how he projects adult feelings onto children too young to think that way, as in the child wanting to watch the same TV show as peers--sorry, they are not thinking of it in terms of a \\"cultural experience\\"; 2) assuming that \\"natural consequences\\" is always practiced without any concern for mitigating circumstances--most parents would ask why a raincoat was left behind, and THEN do something, or not, depending on the answer; 3) the teenager missing dinner. Is he kidding? I don't know anyone who does that--the teen heats up his own leftovers; 4) his insistence that any form of \\"time-out\\" is actually \\"love-withdrawal\\".  Good grief. <br /> <br />The way he deals with tantrums (well, in his case, a \\"sit-down strike\\" by his child, hardly a \\"tantrum\\" judging from what I've seen in stores on occasion) by essentially waiting them out works for him because he apparently is self-employed and can make his own schedule--he probably does have lots of spare time. Many parents are not in his situation--they have appointments, are maybe shopping with two or more children at the same time, etc.  <br /> <br />Bottom line: read this book at the library first. This is the second book of his that I've read, and he seems to be long on complaining about the problem but short on real, workable solutions.	2005-07-19

There are some very interesting designs in it.    However, the sizing is very limited, and designs that should be done in thinner yarns (like the Ballet Sweater), are done in bulky yarns. I too, pull out my copy, look at it, sigh and shake my head, then put it back on the shelf. The Geek sweater is *very* cute, but is only for a child--it practically cries out for a Mommy or Daddy version--it would look so great in each family member's favorite colors. The Yarnover Steek Vest would be okay as a bathing suit cover-up perhaps, but I don't think too many Moms would want their daughters running around town in it as the model in the picture is wearing it.     There are several comments at [...] about this book, including questions (and hopefully answers forthcoming) about how to resize the patterns.  You shouldn't have to rewrite/resize patterns--the whole point of buying patterns is so you don't have to reinvent the wheel every time....     The photos of the models were also odd-looking. They did nothing to help one to think that these items were going to be worn by people other than models. Some of the patterns are no doubt adaptable to larger sizes, but probably would not look good on larger women--and in this book, large seems to indicate anyone larger than a 10! Sorry, but it was not all that long ago that 12 was considered a good, healthy size to be.     Knitting is hot right now, but as soon as more people actually do the math and realize how expensive the sweaters in this and other books are *before* they sit down and knit a single stitch, I wouldn't be surprised to see more people dropping out of the craft altogether, or sticking to scarves and other small projects. If you're going to put all that time and expense into something, it had better be something that is wearable past one season. Not necessarily a \\"boring\\" classic, but something that will look good on a variety of body shapes, and will go with other items in a person's wardrobe.    This is not to say that Ms. Durham doesn't have some good ideas--she does, and I love some of her designs in other publications, such as Scarf Style, but this book is definitely not for everyone.	2005-07-17
US	34590585	RUFPKHK8YPOTX	060960645X	749867643	10 Steps to Fashion Freedom: Discover Your Personal Style from the Inside Out	Books	2	10	20	N	Y	For Artists and Entrepreneurs....everyone else, not so great.	If you take the time to work through the exercises, this book would probably be very helpful to people who are trying to make a name for themselves as an artist of any sort, or to any entrepreneurs who feel their clothing can help them stand out in a good way from all the other people in their type of work--in either case, YOU will be setting the boundaries as to what is acceptable clothing to wear, and will get the most out of this book, as it is a relatively thorough way to get the benefit of an image consultant without actually hiring one. However, it will *not* help you if you are say, a stay-at-home-parent wishing to quickly learn how to \\"power dress\\" for a school board meeting.  <br /> <br />For people who are employees, which are most of us, you may or may not be allowed to express your creativity, because your idea of style might not send the right message to the company's target audience. Think Danny on last season's The Apprentice--his attire is very common and accepted in his field, but doesn't work everywhere else. The key here is that as long as you are working for someone else, you *will* have limits placed on how you can dress, either personally by your employer, by your field, unless you are so successful and in demand that you can do as you wish, and to heck with everyone else. <br /> <br />I felt this book, besides being geared toward the British, who tend to be more formal anyway, was also geared toward the east coast of the US.  There was no discussion of regional clothing/style preferences--I didn't expect talk of Texas Big Hair, etc., mind you, but you're wearing completely different clothes and footwear in say, the Pacific Northwest, where it rains or is threatening to rain most of the year, and sidewalks are not as prevalent.  <br /> <br />And I found their discussion of what constituted \\"extraneous additions\\", to be irritating. Many people happen to LIKE elastic in a waistband, provided you can easily replace it when necessary, or the littlecinch straps in a waistband even though you still have beltloops--not everybody likes to wear belts. The authors  don't like leather patches on sweaters--well, they can no doubt afford to trash an otherwise still-in-excellent-condition sweater with holes in the elbows--most people can't. Oversize pockets are another no-no to them. Sorry, many of us prefer useful pockets to dragging around purses.  <br /> <br />I got the distinct impression that neither of them have ever actually *worked* in the clothing they wear, sell and recommend, if you know what I mean. However, many of us DO have to perform physical work in our clothes, so practicality does figure into our clothing buying decisions. Most, if not all of what they discuss requires drycleaning, handwashing, or at least ironing, and who has the time or money for that these days, especially when in most cases you are not provided a clothing allowance for your job?  <br /> <br />But the last straw for me was in \\"Session 4: Your Inner Style Inventory\\" when they described a visit from Emma Thompson, in very casual wear, to their store. Not only did they praise her manners to the skies, they went on to say that inner style will go beyond clothes you wear, or words to that effect. Well gee, is that so, and if so, what  then IS the point of this book? But it gets worse. Further on in the chapter, they then describe meeting with some executive (very well-dressed), in Los Angeles. Later, they meet him again in Beverly Hills and he's gone all Casual Friday on them (oh, the pain, the pain!), so now they've lost all respect for him.  Again, do clothes matter or not? Two conflicting views, and in the same chapter, no less. If it were MY company, yes I would expect to be able to wear what I wanted and to put my feet on the desk whenever I wished, without caring about what someone I was in a position to hire was thinking. <br /> <br />They then go on to bemoan the fact that some companies now seem to be in Casual mode Monday-Friday. You could almost hear the whine of \\"Waaah, we're losing potential business left and right, waaah!\\" Maybe that's why this book is out, and why they teach/taught through The Learning Annex, because people have come to their senses and don't require or desire this type of service for the exhorbitant money they charge. <br /> <br />Bottom line, this book is an interesting and useful read for a very limited audience, or a great read if you're just interested in an explanation of how this sort of thing is done (try to borrow from the library first, before buying, as I did). I bought it used through Amazon. If you need something to help you get put together fast, for women I recommend \\"Does this Make Me Look Fat?\\" and \\"The Lucky Shopping Manual\\".  For guys, I can't think of any books because they can just go into any quality store (e.g. Mens Wearhouse) and come out looking great because the tailoring is figured into the price of the suit.	2005-07-17

This book is very good for giving you many ideas for what goes with what, especially if you're the type who really *doesn't* care about clothing and hates to shop for it (as in, you LIKE jobs with uniforms because there is no decision-making required :-). Also plenty of ideas for turning casual looks into dressy looks fast. <br /> <br />The pictures are what really make this book special--pictures of underwear, shoes, different kinds of tops, purses (although no ideas for a good-looking backpack-style purse that some of us more practical types favor), etc. The book is a little heavy to drag around with you to the store, but you could trace outlines of the styles you need on some paper and put that in your bag to shop with. <br /> <br />There are lots of pictures showing how to dress to accentuate the positive aspects of your figure as well. They could have been drawn a little more clearly--one in particular showing that you should not wear ballet flats with a short skirt didn't seem to really reflect that, as the legs in the picture did not look any chunkier than in the \\"correct\\" picture with the higher heels. Other pictures had that same type of flaw--some should have been shown in profile, rather than face-forward, to show the correction. <br /> <br />Overall, 4 and half stars. I did think that the author went a bit overboard as far as how many clothing items to own--what she recommends seems to require having entire summer and winter closets when you add it all together....  Also, black clothes were mentioned a lot (as in \\"little black dress\\"),  and not everyone should wear black, so what do those people do? The \\"travel packing\\" section was pretty good, but, IMHO, didn't do enough in the \\"mix and match\\" department--for those who wish to travel light and not check baggage, that is important. <br /> <br />Well worth having in your own personal library if you hate clothes shopping, or buying as a gift for a similar-minded friend.	2005-07-16

This book has some very good information, but it is not presented in an easy-to-find manner (there is NO index), and the author is very annoying with how she drops brand names everywhere.  <br /> <br />There are very few useful pictures of clothing, unlike the Lucky Shopping Manual. Not everybody knows what \\"princess\\" or \\"empire\\" style means, and clear pictures would help a lot. You need to know *what* to look for in the store, not necessarily who makes it. Not everybody has access to the stores she mentions, or would necessarily choose to shop those stores if a less-expensive alternative is available. <br /> <br />The figure styles, while useful as a starting point, again suffer from lack of good pictures in the puttting outfits together department. And as another reviewer noted, why not put the tips for \\"plus-size\\" with the ABC body types, instead of separate sections that were somewhat redundant. <br /> <br />It mentions \\"tailoring\\" so many times in the context of having to \\"fix\\" Ready-to-Wear clothes so they actually fit that you get the impression you're much better off going to your local fabric store, checking out the pattern collection, and learning to sew and make your own classic (in the sense of will always work for you) clothes, or have a tailor/seamstress do it (unless you are lucky enough to have a whiz-kid in 4-H who really likes to sew). Or at least learn how to do your own alterations. It was actually very discouraging to read how she has to have just about everything altered to make clothing look just right for photo shoots. Makes you think twice about ordering clothes by mail or online.  <br /> <br />The book is worth buying used, especially for people who have been out of the working world for a while, or who are now working at an outside job after working from home in their jammies or other comfortable equivalent and need to build up a new wardrobe again to work in a fairly dressy environment.	2005-07-16

This book makes such a fuss over homeschooling, yet from the beginning when it brags about the daughter's many degrees, it goes on to continually quote from people who have....degrees, as if having a degree makes everything you say automatically worth listening to! And, get this, the daughter is....a teacher (granted, a college professor, but still!).  It is as if all that matters to these people is the slip of paper. The slip of paper is not the same as an education, people.<br />They went to so much effort to avoid being part of the system, only for the daughter to become part of it. And yes, it is strange to mention the other two children at the beginning, but not anywhere else in the book. I also got the impression that there wasn't much time for any extracurricular activities that took a lot of time, or required much time away from home.<br />They make some very good points in this book, such as beginning with phonics for reading, but are totally off-base when in comes to the value of computers and the internet.  Their attitude is if it isn't in print from an &quot;established&quot; book publisher, it's suspect. A fact is a fact, wherever you find it. Get with the future, ladies, where students are consumers, and they will go where they can find the information, and quickly. The internet is quickly removing the need for conventional &quot;brick-and-mortar&quot; schools anyway, except for classes like band and drama, where you need lots of people.<br />I also was disappointed in the lack of a real &quot;catch-up&quot; program for the older student. As one reviewer pointed out, you get the impression that you're too late if you don't start in preschool. Maybe read everything on their list in a &quot;Cliff's Notes&quot; or &quot;Classic Comics&quot; version to get up to speed? LOL<br />And do you really need to take an entire course in Latin? Why not just study the major root words  (which comprise about 30-40% of English) and take a modern language like Spanish? Any time you take a foreign language, you learn about your own language's grammar and syntax.<br />Also, the book/resource lists seemed to go on forever. They would have done the reader a service listing them by publisher first, then subject/grade level--Dover appeared constantly, and I know they have a catalogue. The lists take up a good portion of the book, too. I see that this edition is already &quot;unavailable&quot;, and the new version is updated with new ordering info, etc., at a higher price, of course.<br />Even at the Amazon price, considering that a good portion of the book consists of lists/contact info that will go out of date quickly, this book is overpriced. I will look for it used.? Any time you take a foreign language, you learn about your own language's grammar and syntax.<br />Also, the book/resource lists seemed to go on forever.

I had heard such good things about this book, so borrowed it from the library.  It is a quick read.<br />The good:<BR>She makes many good points about clutter, why we accumulate it, and how to get rid of it. I would give this part 5 stars. She has a very good way of showing you how to look at your stuff in a much more detached manner, which in turn makes it easier to let it go (hopefully to a good home).<br />However:<BR>You have to wade through a lot of pseudo-superstitious stuff, some of it feng shui, some of it her talking about seeing auras in people's stuff. Also, as one reviewer pointed out, the author apparently does not have children (or other family) to deal with. It is nice to just take the easy way out and toss everything, but that only works if you have tons of money (to replace things). Also, dumping perfectly good stuff is simply wasteful.  You get the idea that the author either eats out a lot, or eats off paper plates.<br />I got the distinct impression that feng shui is great if you don't really *live* in your house, but merely stay there, like you do in a hotel. The author doesn't really address the issue of say, people who both live and work at home, or stay-at-home parents.  What are you supposed to do in these virtually empty houses? Contemplate the wonders of your belly button? <br />So, bottom line (and the colon cleaning chapter is completely unnecessary as well), try to find this book used. It is somewhat overpriced, even with the Amazon discount, especially since it was printed on cheap newsprint, such as is used for paperback novels--the library copy is already starting to yellow.  By the time you wade through all the filler, as others have pointed out, only about 20-40 pages are useful, and this was not a large book to begin with, size-wise.	2004-03-31

I borrowed this from the library, and was disappointed in a number of things:<br />First, good luck getting one of the white postal mail templates they talk about and picture near the the beginning of the book. The post office I went to wouldn't give you anything unless you were planning to do bulk mail, where everything has to be a certain size and fit in with certain guidelines (the uniformity and sheer numbers is why bulk mail is cheaper). The book states that your post office will give you one for free just for the asking--NOT!<br />Second, if you are going to demonstrate folds, use solid-colored paper for clarity's sake. The paper they used was so busy that it was difficult to see fold lines.<br />Third, I had seen just about all of their projects in other books before, so if you have done any reading on this subject at all you are likely to be disappointed. <br />Bottom line: wait 'til this one is remaindered.	2004-03-12

I read a review of this book on a knitting forum where someone mentioned that they were old enough to remember when &quot;B****&quot; was a derogatory term. Hunh? It still is, if you were brought up with any manners at all.<br />As to the patterns, well, the devil and kitty hats have been out on the web as well as in magazines, and the rest of the items don't look all that special--some of the striped items look like they come from the Gap. All the color photos are in the middle, and many of the photos had the camera tilted, as well as the models being photographed in very cluttered settings, which takes away from the items.<br />Also, the orange around the pages does nothing for the book--money would have been better spent on better layout.<br />This book is just okay, and is not the greatest for children, unless you have already explained what &quot;ribbed for her pleasure&quot; means.	2003-12-17

First off, I think using pictures is a great idea. It is a fact that some people learn better from pictures than words.<br />However....<br />With rare exceptions, there are no portion measurements, either by weight or volume. The pictures can be really deceptive--how large IS that bagel that has so many calories? What constitutes a \\"small\\" cantalope? and so on. I think the veggie pictures were \\"enlarged for detail\\" somewhat....<br />Also, few pictures have detailed ingredient lists. Potato salad can be made with  three ingredients or 10 ingredients, definitely changing the calorie and fat content. Unless you make it yourself or have a nutritional brochure (rarely available at regular restaurants), how can you make an intelligent choice between options just using a picture? And ordering fresh fruit in a restaurant is dicey--often it is underripe or past its prime. Better off to buy fruit at the grocery or farmer's market and take it with you.<br />There are NO recipes in this book.  The restaurants he profiled menus on were all New York-based and looked to be very pricey. He also relies very heavily on low-fat items which contains lots of sweeteners, and promotes soy products while virtually ignoring all the other beans out there. And yes, white instant rice isn't so great, but what about brown rice?<br />I found it contradictory that he would on one page say it didn't matter if you were genuinely hungry or not when eating, but his food journal page contains an entry for you to rate your hunger.<br />This book is no substitute for reading food labels, getting a scale and a good set of measuring cups/spoons. The pictures alone will not do it, unless you decide to become a vegetarian, more or less, which is fine except that it conflicts with his assertion that you can eat anything you want. You need to practice a while with scale and measuring cups. Eyeballing amounts isn't going to work here, you have to be exact, or you're going to eat too much.<br />Buy used if youcan't get it at your library.	2003-07-28

For example, if you're an employer, pay as little as you can, offer no benefits, especially continuing education, hire indie contractors instead of employees, etc. If you are an employee, no loyalty, ask for as much money as you can get, demand paid continuing education, change jobs every three years happy or not, etc.<br />His advice works only if you are in businesses that are like his, lawyer or othere white collar professional, or jobs where machines can do most of your work. SOMEBODY has to do physical work of some sort, so that others can do what Pollan espouses. Someone has to clean houses, make food at restaurants, take care of the elderly in nursing homes. Are you prepared to either work all your life to pay $$$$ an hour for this, or at some point are you going to do some of this stuff yourself to save money and/or make money off of others? <br />He seems to feel that any sort of actual \\"labor\\" is something to be avoided. Well, who is going to weed his garden, or make the computers or any other machines he needs in his business?<br />I actually found part 2 of the book more useful.	2003-07-21

Out of 18 patterns, only about 3-4 are interesting or unusual enough to want to knit as written. Some of the patterns have some elements that can be incorporated into other hats, but as hats in this book they are boring.  Homespun, Handknit by Linda Ligon has better hats, imho.<br />I expected more from this book. Maybe what they should have done is had a contest for the best spun yarn (since this was from Spin-Off magazine), and had other knitters do the hat designs. Or maybe the really good and unusual patterns were reserved for another use--like future magazine projects.  <br />I'm keeping it, but glad I bought it at the Amazon.com price and not the full price.	2003-07-18

Both Lydia Bach and Callan Pinckney studied under Lotte Berk for a time, then went their separate ways. Callan did some modifications to the exercises so that people with back problems (which she also had) could do them, as well as people who were just starting out. Lydia did not modify them. When you read this book, you definitely get the message that if you are not already fit, or someone who has the flexibility of a ballet dancer or a yogi, don't bother.<br />It kind of has some artsy/grainy black and white photography, and is interesting if you are looking at the original method to see where Callanetics came from, but as a manual of exercise, even though it demonstrates the positions, it is not as &quot;ordinary people&quot; friendly as Callanetics.

I have mixed feelings about this book.<br />It makes some good points, like finding out about all the checks your spouse may get (such as uniform allowances), but I feel that its underlying message is about deception in your marriage, by hiding money away. It promotes hiding money, instead of educating you in how to equally partner with your spouse in how you deal with money. It also deals with the issue 'way after the fact, instead of say, providing a list of \\"warning signs\\" about money that you should look before thinking about marriage. <br />Also, if it is \\"always\\" okay for a wife to hide money, why is it \\"always\\" wrong for the husband to do so?  Fair is fair. Men aren't the only ones who are spendthrifts, or drop everything to run away with a new lover. If your spouse is a spendthrift, find an honest way to deal with the problem instead of squirrelling money away. <br />And this person recommends you put your name as a wife on everything except your tax returns. Huh? Always file separately? If you can't trust your spouse to do the taxes, why are you still married to him? And who says YOU can't pay to have the taxes done?<br />I got the feeling that this book was really written for the older (let the man handle the money) generation, not for today's woman who should know better. It also seems to be geared more towards people who live in (and get divorced in) \\"equitable distribution\\" states, not community property states, since it talks about spending money to \\"establish a lifestyle pattern\\" to figure out future support. And that's another thing, it seems to look at a nest egg as some sort of emergency escape fund, which again, seems to see marriage as something that will fail, so you better plan ahead. Huh? Why get married at all then?<br />I will say that if you are planning to get a divorce, this would be a good book to look at.	2003-06-19

Use white cards and just use a colored dot or sticker, or not.<br />The big difference is that it puts several jobs per room on one card, instead of each job having its own card, as in the first book. You would no doubt come around to doing this eventually just having the first book as you fiddle with the system. <br />As to the &quot;infraction game&quot; (leave stuff out, have to pay to get it back), I don't see it working for some or even many families, just as allowances don't work as a chore motivator if children are smart enough (or jaded enough) to see that someone will eventually feed the dog,  even if they don't, and I doubt that some parent will make their child pay to get their homework back if it gets left on the kitchen table.<br />The book is okay, but definitely read at the library before you buy it. You might like it better than the first one. I did not get much out of the Buzz Word cards, for example. I do like it better for the streamlining of the original system. As others have said of both books, their time estimates are 'way off. Something you don't want to do ALWAYS takes longer to do than you think it will. Leave off the time estimates and just think, &quot;This job first, do not stop till it is done. On to the next one.&quot; I think the system  works better for you this way.<br />You can also adapt this system to a To Do List, or even put it on your computer or handheld if you wish. Sidetracked Home Executives is the better of the two books, imho.	2003-05-10

I don't know why you'd want to bother putting this system on a computer or handheld, the index card system (or even just cut up all those one-sided ads for &quot;cards&quot;) uses no electricity or batteries and works just fine, even during power outages. Their system is just as useful for any other &quot;job&quot; (and keeping house is a job, make no mistake, even if you like that sort of thing) that requires a lot of repetitive work. I think its greatest value is to keep you on a schedule long enough to establish good habits, and as you establish those habits you can get rid of some or even all of the cards.<br />I don't know how you'd get overwhelmed with the system and do too many cards--I imagine most people who are &quot;housekeeping-challenged&quot; in the first place are never going to get to the point where they want to do MORE housecleaning than they absolutely have to. You might get bogged down if you write down *every* little step--to me, &quot;mop floor&quot; automatically means to sweep/vacuum first, but not necessarily to other people.<br />I think this book is much better than their other book, Get Your Act Together: 7-Day Get-Organized Plan.... Get Your Act Together is somewhat repetitive, and contains some of the same stories as this book. I also wasn't into the division of the week into &quot;free day&quot;, &quot;half-cleaning day&quot;, etc. Just divide up the chores as fits the rest of your schedule. Not saying that it isn't worth reading, but you don't have to run out and get it too.<br />If you have the older editions, you don't need the newest, not enough is revised to make it worth buying.	2003-05-05

The home workout leaves a lot to be desired, and there is only one routine. Zickerman seems to really be against free weights, and even some tension provided by holding onto a weight (the new weighted balls marketed by Leslie Sansone and yoga/pilates groups would be ideal once the prices come down) would be beneficial in performing the exercises.<br />Also, this book is full of testimonials and has a lot of empty space--one or two are fine, but the rest are just dead weight (so to speak).<br />This book is a quick read, but I would use it in conjunction with Joyce Vedral's 12-Minute Total Body Workout book--her routine is really geared towards someone working out at home or while traveling, and the Power of 10 concepts could easily be adapted to it. You also have a greater variety of exercises to choose from.	2003-04-22

It's one thing to wax enthusiastic about your exercise concepts, but quite another to say that virtually every other form of exercise is unsafe, or a waste of time. That kind of approach just makes your own claims suspect.<br />This book has a better home workout (you may have seen excerpts in women's magazines quite a while back) but it, like Power of 10, really would rather have you working out in a gym. What a shame, the concepts can easily be applied to working with free weights, and you could get a good workout using a book like Joyce Vedral's 12-Minute Total Body Workout with the concepts presented here.<br />It's kind of a toss up as to which book between Slow Burn and Power of 10 to buy, they both have their faults mixed in between the good stuff. This book has more &quot;how and why it works&quot; to wade through. I think they should have given more pages to making a better home workout instead.	2003-04-22

All you need are two 3-lb. dumbbells and a chair.<br />She does have a written cheat sheet at the back of the book, but the only quibble I have is that there should be a photo cheat sheet as well--the names of the exercises don't immediately bring them to mind.<br />There is good variety in the exercises, and you can use them to supplement any of the exercises in Slow Burn and Power of 10. Her explanations of Isometric Exercise and Dynamic Tension fit perfectly in with the super slow weightlifting concept.	2003-04-22

I found the instructional photos in this book 'way too small to provide any good detail, and the sweater designs were too boxy to look good on anyone except the tall and skinny (i.e. models). A lot of them look like sweaters you can get at the stores, except for the yarns. A total beginner will get something out of this book, but if you already know how to knit, pass on this one.<br />I really enjoyed her other book, Sally Melville Styles, so this book was a disappointment.	2003-01-08

So far I am not impressed enough to buy it unless the price comes down. While it does have some good techniques, the drawings were not as clear as they could be, and the directions are not written very clearly either--I understood what the author was getting at only after reading another person's description of the technique. The line drawings of the socks also didn't do a whole lot for the overall effect.<br />Also this particular edition has not only very large margins, but also several repeats of the measurements page (to make socks for others). One to copy is plenty. So, overall, the book is somewhat overpriced for what you get. In fact, I got the impression that it was an expanded magazine article, and a lot of the same information is already out on the net. So check it out to see if you understand what she's driving at first, and wait for it to come out in paper.	2003-01-08

I disagree with some of the critics/reviewers--many of the stories in the other two books were &quot;People&quot; stories as well, they are just told differently. <br />I am also glad that there were some new stories that are in this book (that weren't in Pilgrimage and The People). I think this book should be required reading in schools instead of Harry Potter and other such drivel.	2002-12-27

It has NOTHING to do with using up yarn you may already have from other projects. There is no information on yarn substitution, and there is a lot of blank margin on the pages, which makes the book larger than it needs to be (and necessitates extra page-turning). A good knitting book needs to be useful beyond the lifespan of the current yarns available, and this one doesn't really pass that test.<br />As another reviewer stated, there are more projects than clothing patterns, which is not necessarily bad, but look before you buy. Even with the Amazon discount, this book is 'way overpriced for what you get.  I'll wait until this one is remaindered.	2002-12-24
US	34590585	RUDEXY1C56OX	1570762244	568274586	50 Baby Bootees to Knit	Books	3	7	7	N	Y	Not 50 different booties....	There are NOT 50 DIFFERENT booties in this book, there are some socks (click to get a larger image of the photo, where you can read the extended title) and booties with several variations. <br />To me, changing the edging design or using a pompon instead of a bell on the toe does not make it a different bootie. Also, they all use expensive yarns with no pictures to make substituting easier when the featured yarns are discontinued. Another bad thing is that if you're looking for booties that are completely done on dpns, you won't find them--they all (except for the socks, which you can adapt to the toe-up method to avoid kitchener stitch if you wish) require some sewing up.<br />However, that said, there are a few (and I mean few--several are commonly available designs with pricier yarn) really cute designs in the book which make it worth buying. It is also nice in that it is spiral bound so it will lie flat.<br />And the biggest issue I have with the book is that they never show the booties on the babies' feet. You can can only see the top of the booties, but realistically because of how babies are held in one's arms they need to look as good on the bottom as they do on the top. You really wonder how good the stiched together parts look. They have been carefully photographed so that you can't see either the bottoms or the backs, which usually indicates sloppy finishing work. And there are NO pictures on how to stitch them up properly.<br />Too bad the patterns aren't scaled up for grown-ups--the ones on the cover, for example, would make great Mommy-Daughter gifts. Baby booties are also a great way to use up odds and ends of yarn, especially for charity work.	2002-12-09

And, it would be better if they had actual size photos of the yarns, so that the book will be more useful years from now.<br />Finally, any book this new should have had directions for using two circulars instead of double-pointed needles.	2002-10-22
US	34590585	R3OWVYK76A8UWJ	0964639130	735938555	Magnificent Mittens	Books	4	7	8	N	Y	Pretty good book	I wanted to rate it 4 and 1/2 stars.<br />I like this book. It has lots of patterns good for other small items like hats and socks. It has a good explanation of the &quot;toe-up&quot; (or I should say, &quot;top down&quot;) method of knitting, much better, in fact than the explanation in her sock book. Her other directions are fairly clear as well.<br />The only real drawback to this book is that you will have to make a copy of the basic instructions (which appear only at the front of the book, not with each pattern), and a copy of the chart for the particular pattern you're knitting because this is too big a book to comfortably carry around with you.	2002-10-04

I wanted to rate it 3 and 1/2 stars.<br />These are SO basic, they look like the mass-produced stuff, and why would you spend hours knitting something like that? Sooo, some pictures using fancy yarn with the patterns instead of just the plain stuff would help immensely. I was also very surprised that there was not a generic seamless sweater pattern--buy The Sweater Workshop by Jacqueline Fee for that.<br />It is a pretty good book, but for this type of book there is one glaring omission--how to calculate the amount needed for the particular yarn one is using. The author does list a low to high figure in yardage, but does not split out for each particular size of yarn, so you run the risk of buying 'way too much &quot;just to be on the safe side&quot;. Also, some yarn labels only have weights listed, not yardage, so you need to be able to calculate it both ways, by weight and by yardage.<br />I was not that impressed with the elastic band (How hard is it to put a rubber band around a book if you need to?) and envelope pocket (not very sturdy--looks great until you actually put something in it), and I would have preferred the sturdier binding of say, the Vogue On the Go Knitting books for something that is geared towards being dragged around everywhere.<br />I did like the glossary, and I do like the way the patterns are written out. This is a good book, but not a &quot;run out and buy it right away&quot; book.	2002-10-04

Really good book, although I'm sorry it is not in the spiral format as the 1st edition was.<br />It has some new sweaters (although some of the good old ones were left out to make room) and the idea of an aran sampler is really nice.<br />...Great gift for a new knitter.	2002-10-01

Some of the patterns are nice, but she uses yarns (dark colored and varigated) that don't show off the texture work very well. Hard to check whether you're doing the pattern correctly or not. I mean, if you're going to work a complicated pattern, you might want to be able to see it.<br />Also, there is a lot of blank space in the book, which means you are turning pages to get all of the instructions. The spiral binding is nice so that it will lie flat, but because of the hard spine, you can't fold it to just see one page, which would have been nice for a &quot;travelling&quot; book.<br />Overall, the book is okay, and I will probably use the patterns, but I am glad I didn't pay full price for it.	2002-09-30

This book is not as bad as some have made it out to be, but it is way overpriced (not unusual with Interweave Press).<br />I liked it because the author did show the effect of using different types of yarns together. There are quite a few close-up color pictures. The clothing patterns are not bad, but the mosaic patterns are simple enough that you may, as an earlier reviewer mentioned, wonder why to use slip stitches instead of fair isle. I guess it would be just a matter of personal preference--do you want to knit with both colors at once, or do you essentially want to knit each row twice?<br />I agree that more intricate patterns are in the Barbara Walker book, but those too could be knitted in fair isle if you didn't mind the long floats.<br />One thing nice about this book is that it actually has a section on how to design your own mosaic patterns which the Barbara Walker books do not have. Bartlett's patterns, however, seem more like motifs that you might look at knitting in intarsia rather than by mosaic or fair isle.<br />Not a \\"go out and buy right now\\" book, but a decent addition to any knitting library.	2002-09-25

The book is more like a thin magazine (like only 50 pages), and it looks like someone printed it at home on a computer, then took it to a copy shop. You have to go back and forth between the cover and the directions, and as you can tell from the cover, they are not large color pictures.<br />I also found the directions difficult to understand, which wasn't good either. They are very chatty and could use more and better illustrations.<br />As another reviwer has already mentioned, the two-circular needle technique you can find instructions for on the web, and you could probably use it with the directions for the toe-up socks (or top-down, for mittens) in Anna Zilboorg's Fancy Feet or (mittens) in Magnificent Mittens...	2002-09-23
