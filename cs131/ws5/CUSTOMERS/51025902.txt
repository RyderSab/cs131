I laughed, frowned, and smirked while reading this book because I could see bits and pieces of myself within the pages of this humurous [sp?] read. I chuckled when I was able to identify myself as a Boho (dimunitive of Bohemian) BAP. I frowned when I got towards the end and read about how one of a BAP's major goals is planning and preparing for her wedding day. I frowned because I've never been one to care too much about getting married . . . but alas, I'm only 20, so I'm not sweating it. Once I've attained my JD, I'll worry about it, because BAPs are ALWAYS pursuing perfection! ROFLMAO . . . I also happened to smirk when I read various scenes that relate to my experiences as a BAP growing up.<br />Aside from that, the book was a very entertaining read about the lifestyle of a BAPbaby from birth to the time that she gets married when the cycle starts all over again!<br />All in all, this is a recommended read if you're a 'sistah' that isn't from the 'ghetto fabulous' set. One of the reasons why I liked this handbook so much is because it shows a different side of Nubian life besides the 'hoochie coochie' mama that we always see in the movies (ie; John Singleton's latest hit, \\"Baby Boy\\") like another reviewer mentioned. For that, I give these ambitious BAPs (the authors' of the book) a standing ovation on a book that's well off the beaten course of Nubian entertainment.	2001-11-20

I am thoroughly and COMPLETELY THRILLED that Alice Randall decided to write this book because (...) I can see the underlying racism that Alice Randall is in essence, trying to get us to see. You see, this novel isn't really about black versus white versus maletto characters in her novel, it's about 'American' society's views on how our past occurred. (...) If slaves cared for their masters so darn much, the 'underground railroad' would have NEVER been constructed (with Harriet Tubman at the forefront of it)!!! In my mind, I think Alice Randall created this novel just to see how much of an up roar white America would cause over this . . . and needless to say, you failed the test miserably. I believe Randalls' account of 'The Wind Done Gone' is a more believable one by far than GWTW, why??? Because of the (...) underlying racist undertones throughout GWTW that made it a depressing and down right degrading read for many African-Americans. (...) Slavery wasn't 'peachy keen' for anyone, and white families weren't as innocent and 'clean' as they were depicted in GWTW . . . wake up America!!! Randalls' just given you a bright and early wake up call, it's time for you (white America) to answer it!!! United we stand indeed . . . this isn't 'reverse discrimination,' how can it be when it's closer to the truth than GWTW will ever be??? (...)	2001-11-18

I have say that I was pleasantly surprised by Ms. Morgan's discussion of issues that have been rolling through my mind for the past couple of years. I could identify IMMENSELY with the STRONGBLACKWOMAN ideology. I guess you could say that I'm a STRONGBBLACKWOMAN type myself. I would say that I'm recovering, but it's really hard to do so when you're in college, holding an excellent GPA, and being a part of so many different ogranizations. It's just SO hard to say no!!! LOL<br />   As far as the rest of this masterpiece of feminine literature goes, I have to say that there were certain parts that I disagreed with. I was kinda hurt when she down talked African-American peeps from middle class backgrounds...I mean, why did she work so hard to have a good income to take care of her son if middle class peeps &quot;don't wanna be reminded of their kinky roots&quot;? Just something to think about...maybe I took it the wrong way, but that's just the way I see things.<br />   Secondly, I have to say that I in NO WAY envy Chickenheads...in fact, I'm glad that they're around to take all the weak men who fall for them off the market. One thing I can't stand is a man that's weak enough to fall for anything that has a big behind and a C cup!!! I want a strong, intelligent man that can appreciate a woman with class, home training, a solid head on her shoulders, and plenty of goals with the ambition to follow through on them like myself!!!<br />  I guess this book was a wake up call for me to write my own view on things. I come from a middle class home, unlike most African-American feminists that come from very poor backgrounds. I feel my voice needs to be heard and you can believe that I WILL put the work into writing a novel that speaks from the standpoint of sistas like myself!!! Good work Ms. Morgan!!! Thanks for encouraging me to keep perfecting my craft!!!	2001-07-07

Shoot, i'm currently majoring in computer science, with a minor in  creative writing, but i might have to switch it around! this brother was  working it front to back.    but on a serious note, i was really feeling  the characters in this book. seeing chiquita brought back (a main character  in Sister Sister), although i was unhappy with her choice of relationship,  was good. but, i must say that shelby reminded me a lot of myself; her  whole attitude, and persona towards men and life had me rolling throughout  the book. and debra reminded me of one of my close friends, with her down  to earth, motherly type vibe, her and leonard made a really cute couple.      all in all, it was really sad how the book ended, but then again, that's  just how life is sometimes, which only added to the element of keeping the  story real and believable. i learned that you just can't stop true,  meant-to-be-together love, and that sometimes, love is the only thing that  keeps you sane on an otherwise bad day. pick this book up and support an  outstanding african-american author. you won't be sorry, you'll be hooked  on every last word, yet again, i guarantee it!	2000-09-19

Well listen to her, because this book was mediocre at best. Maybe somebody else will enjoy hearing about a couple's marriage of convenience, but I personally wasn't amused by this mockery of the holy  institution. True, romance books aren't suppose to be written like the  bible, but any time you have two people getting married just to get a piece  of land from their grandmother, I just don't think that's right.<br />And if  the heroine, Monique had such a succesful salon before, I don't understand  why she didn't have enough money set aside to pay for her own bills,  instead of being dependent on a man!<br />All in all, I felt like Monique  played the predictable 'helpless female' while Nick Parker played the  easily understandable 'strong, take control man'. If you want something  predictable, then read this book, otherwise, keep searching.	2000-02-27

If this is any indication for Ms. Poarch, then I say not to expect great things from her. I mean, the plot seemed like it could've gone further if only she didn't make it seem so dull. It's almost as if  they (the characters) fell for each other too soon and she felt like she  had to drag it out to meet a page quota or something.   I dunno, maybe  somebody else will like this book better, but for me it seemed more like a  stretched out mystery, with a drawn out love story attached.	2000-02-27

Any brotha that will stay with a sista when she becomes unable to take care of herself is just heart warming to me. It absolutely stole my heart when Christian (the hero) washed Sean's hair for her (the heroine), but it made me mad when Sean tried to act all uppity with him. I mean, how can you  get a brother better than that (which is why I gave the book a 4 instead of  a 5)? If Sean doesn't want him, I'll take him!<br />And oh my goodness, I  cannot tell you how the terrorist scenes had me steadly turning from page  to page. And when you finally find out who the mystery character is, it'll  really make you think about our own country's stability in times of  terrorist attacks.<br />Extremely moving and intriguing, definitely a most  read.

It was worth the money I shelled out for it, and it actually held my interest, unlike some other BET books that I've read.  <br />Even though in some parts, near the end, it dragged on a little, but the  story of this woman learning to trust and love again, while avoiding  someone who obviously wants to hurt her, was definitely worth the wait.<br />A  delightful read, if I do say so myself!	2000-02-25

You go girl! I just submitted my manuscript  to Arabesque, and I hope I have the insight and same amount of success  you've had. Thank you for your wonderful example of how a romance novel  should be done!	2000-02-17

Please, save your money and buy a different Arabesque novel. I would much rather recommend any book by Loure Bussy (another Arabesque author), or Monica  Jackson, because this book is GARBAGE! I had to pinch myself to keep from  falling asleep!	2000-02-17

It was long and drawn out, and unnecessarily BORING. I cannot tell you how many times this book came close to boring me to sleep. Yeah, the cover of the  book looks good, but you know what they say about judging a book by it's  cover. Everyone do yourself a favor and choose another Arabesque book,  cause this one in particular is garbage.	2000-02-15

Well, I dunno what all these other people were smoking when they wrote their reviews, but ah, this book was ridiculously BORING! From a young adult (18-years-old)'s point of a view, the plot of this book was sappy,  drawn out to the point of boring me to tears and just not worth the five  bucks I shelled out for it. So save your money for a book thats actually  worth the money.	2000-02-15

Well, well, well, I must give it up for Rochunda Lee. This girl worked on this book, with all the twists and turns, I was hooked from the get go! The main character had me cracking up, especially  at the church scene. Y'all  HAVE to read this, even if you're not into romance novels, I'm telling you,  this one will have you hooked.	2000-02-15

I was ready to give up on BET romances, until I read this one. Dianne, you the bomb girl, keep on doing what you're doing.I'm 17, and aspire to be a professional writer some day,  and hope I am as good as you at putting my characters into such deep, yet  easily accessible, and understandable roles. Each role as important as the  next in putting it all together. Liberty is the equivalent of all used and  abused African-American women today. It seemed as if I were right there,  going through her ups and downs, and decietful lies too. Thank you for such  an accurate betrayal of what felt more like a biography than non-fiction.  Keep on pumpimg those books out girl, I'll be there to pick them up, that's  no doubt.	1999-10-11
