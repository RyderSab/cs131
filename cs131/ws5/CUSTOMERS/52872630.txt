Stuart Woods, like many authors everywhere, has made great use of current events to fashion a story that could be true.<br /><br />A rogue former CIA agent Teddy Fay has become a one man execution squad.  Having retired from the CIA, Fay has taken it upon himself to begin capping American politicians of a right wing bend.  Then, with a misplaced sense of patriotism he begins knocking off foriegn diplomats that may have a terrorist connection.  Making matters worse, there is a strong suspicion outside the CIA that it is the agency itself doing the killing.<br /><br />All of this is going on as Holly Barker is wrapping up her training as a CIA agent.  Without giving too much away, Holly wins the day and makes the world safe for more WalMarts and Target stores.<br /><br />Woods in his usual way has crafted a great story.  Lively plot twists, believable dialog, and terrific characters should make this another winner for Mr. Woods.<br /><br />Interesting story, but not his best stuff.	2005-10-12

Winchester takes a story already loaded with suspense, terror, and heroism and manages to make the story even better.  Along the way he dishes out lessons in geography and geology in ways that make the lessons painless.<br /><br />Having grown up in San Diego I have felt my share of tremors.  I was also familiar (I thought)with the San Francisco earthquake.  Well, I didn't know anything.  Thanks to Winchester I now have a grasp of the true dimensions of what happened that early morning in 1906.<br /><br />Crack in the Edge of the World is a page turner.  This book is what nonfiction should always be.	2005-10-12

While Divide is superbly written it lacks the poetic rythms of Horse Whisperer, the intensity of the Loop and the power of Smoke Jumper.<br /><br />Abbie Cooper, a young woman from an affluent family is sought for murder.  When she unexpectedly and tragically turns up dead the reader is thrown into an emotional spiral downward.  What could have caused a woman with so much potential to stray to society's fringe?  And who would want her dead?  The hidden fractures of Abbies family are laid bare for the reader.  It isn't a pretty sight.<br /><br />Evans always supplies the reader with vivid characters and straightforward plots.  He does so in Divide.<br /><br />I do believe that Divide is Evans weakest novel yet, but well worth reading and certainly a lot better than some of the other slop that is out there.	2005-09-30

Doctorow's The March is the latest in a huge library of fiction and nonfiction books dealing with the Civil War.  In the March, Doctorow uses one of the first examples of all-out war ever witnessed.  That this happened on American soil and consisted of brutality delivered against our fellow countrymen hopefully won't be lost on the casual reader.<br /><br />Sherman has marched through Georgia and captured and burned Atlanta.  Savannah is captured and given to Mr. Lincoln as a Christmas gift but is spared the torch.  Sherman's army saved their wrath for the seat of secession....South Carolina and Columbia specifically.<br /><br />E. L. Doctorow is a consumate storyteller able to fully develop a good plot and put characters on the page that are engaging and believeable.  I thing every army has had a character like Arly.  Pearl, the freed slave girl is memorable as is Sherman himself.  The March is no different in this respect than his earlier works.  What is different is that The March is a truly gripping story.  I've had trouble reading some of Doctorows earlier works for some reason.  Ragtime and The Waterworks come to mind.  The March is different.  Whether its the subject which is familiar or my growth as a reader remains to be seen.  What is wonderful is that Doctorow has delivered yet another great read.	2005-09-29

John Berndt hit a home run in 1994 when he wrote Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, an interesting expose about Savannah and some of the more colorful characters that called that wonderful city home.  Serving as a focal point was a midnight murder and subsequent murder trial.  Midnight in the Garden spent four years on the NYT best seller list and made Berendt a world wide celebrity.<br /><br />Berendt has released his second book, The City of the Falling Angels and it reminds me a lot of Midnight.  First is the location.  While I have to admit Savannah and Venice aren't alike, they do both ooze atmosphere.  Savannah, quaint but somewhat isolated is so different from the ancient and worldly city of Venice that it seems hard to understand their connection.  You'll have to read the book first, but I think you'll see why Berendt selected Venice.<br /><br />Secondly, Berendt manages to find some really interesting locals to put in the book:  Olga, the former mistress of Ezra Pound, an artisan glass blower, the Rat-Man, and pigeon exterminators, et al.  These provide the color that was such an interesting part of Midnight.<br /><br />Finally, the loss of the Fenice Opera House and the subsequent trial of the arsonists gives the book an anchor similar to the murder trial in Midnight.<br /><br />Berendt is a consumate story teller.  His prose is like boating on a calm canal.<br /><br />Whether The City of Falling Angels can come close to achieving the status and success of Midnight remains to be seen.  As for me I found The City of Falling Angels and terrific read.	2005-09-28

Diana Gabaldon continues to enthrall the reader with a descriptive style that is second to none.<br /><br />A Breath of Snow and Ashes was a difficult book to read in one day.  At 980 pages, even speed reading takes a major time commitment.<br /><br />As the American Revolution draws near, Jamie Fraser knows that independence is nearly at hand for the American colonists...or at least thats what he believes.  Full of the bitter civil war that the Revolution was in the south, Gabaldon crafts a story that rings true and does a terrific job demonstrating the personal nature of the combat.<br /><br />Technically correct, Gabaldon has done a wonderful job researching her story's time and location.<br /><br />You will want to read the previous books in the Outlander series if you haven't done so.	2005-09-27

I should have stopped reading this book after the first chapter.  I kept reading because I was going to review Bait and Switch for the local newspaper.  Without repeating what other reviewers have said I have to say that the book certainly didn't live up to my expectations.  With all the coaching, training, interviewing, and endless reflection, I kept wondering whether she was not getting hired because she wasn't what she claimed to be.

Seize the Fire by Adam Nicolson is a terrific study of both the English Navy/military, the society that they sprang from, and of the battle of Trafalgar itself.  I've been reading historical accounts of military actions for years, and Seize the Fire is among the best.<br /><br />Nicolson is a talented writer.  Perhaps more important is his apparent skill at research.  Seize the Fire had to be researched over many years and the authors captivation with the topic is evident from the first page.  Included in the work are liberal observations of not only the English, but the French and Spanish as well.<br /><br />The book is well organized and tightly written.  If you're looking for a book on just the battle of Trafalgar then Seize the Fire isn't the book for you.  Loaded with social insights you may become distracted.  If you want a complete picture of the battle with reflection about the era it occurred in (important stuff) then you'll want to read the book.<br /><br />Check with your local library, they probably have it.	2005-09-15

I think Polar Shift, his latest, is probably one of his best. It reminds me of Raise the Titanic in story development and interesting technology.  Fast paced, gripping and believable storyline, great characters, interesting locations...Polar Shift has it all.<br /><br />In the real world, scientists are certain that the magnetic poles on the earth have, in fact, changed in the distant past.  In Polar Shift modern day bad guys are planning on using theories developed in the 30's by a brilliant scientest to cause the poles to shift and thereby drive all of modern society into chaos.  All electronics will become useless, power grids will fail, navigation will become almost impossible.  Your compass needle won't point to the north, but will point south instead.  The purpose behind all this???  Money, what else?<br /><br />Cussler does a good job selling the idea that this can happen at almost any time naturally.  He also convinces the reader that it could BE MADE to happen, by evil guys for profit.<br /><br />Polar Shift is a wonderful read.  The NUMA regulars are back along with some really interesting bad guys. If you've enjoyed other Cussler books, then you know what to expect.	2005-08-30

Will it win the Pulitzer?  Nope.  Will it go down in history with other books about war?  Maybe.  Will you be glad you read the book?  Yup.<br /><br />I thought the most entertaining parts of War Reporting for Cowards are those sections dealing with the Marines he was attached and the war itself.  There is a lot of personal history that Ayres includes that may be important, but I found to be distracting.  I especially liked Ayres story of his first few minutes at Camp Grizzly.  Approached by a young Marine who wants to banter a few lines from Full Metal Jacket, Ayres finally catches on.  Truly irreverent but so truly typical of Marines.<br /><br />An easy read, War Reporting for Cowards will give you a view of the war in Iraq not available anywhere else.	2005-08-19

Now we have revisionist nursery rhymes.  Having not previously read any of Ffords books, when I read the inside cover of The Big Over Easy I wasn't convinced I was interested in proceeding.  Then I made the mistake of opening the book to page 10 and reading \\"Since the death by scalding of Mr. Wolff following his ill-fated climb down Little Pig C's chimney, we at the Nursery Crime Division have been following inquiries that this was not an act of self-defense but a violent and premeditated murder by three individuals who.......\\"<br /><br />I was hooked.  Throughout The Big Over Easy I was constantly taken in my Ffords use of tongue-cheek-phrasing, his play on words, and his use of dry, dry humor.  Since the book deals largely with the death of Humpty-Dumpty, even the title The Big Over Easy is a play on words.<br /><br />I suppose that using Jack Sprat and Mary, Mary as the main police investigators could be seen as a casual one.  I mean there are so many other possibilities...Jack, Jack Pumpkin Eater, Little Boy Blue, Mary Lamb....the list is endless.  I appreciate Fford's choice however, and after reading the book I couldn't imagine any other choice.<br /><br />I suspect that The Big Over Easy may not be everyone's cup of tea, as other reviewers point out.  However, the book was so enjoyable to me that I must recommend it.  Your local public library may be a good choice in this case if you're nervous about buying the The Big Over Easy.  Regardless of your source, I think you'll enjoy it.	2005-08-02

Mr. Goldberg has written a refreshing and brutally honest expose that takes aim at many of America's elite.  He spares no one regardless of profession, ethnic background, race, or economic position.  As I read the pages of 100 People Who are Screwing up America I kept laughing aloud.  I was continually surprised and elated.<br /><br />It has always been a curiosity to me that many of the people that owe this country the most are the very same people who seem more than happy to tear it down.  Mr. Goldberg deals many of them a blow and sets the record straight.<br /><br />If I have anything critical to say about anything he writes it would be where he places certain people on the list.  It might be interesting to take a poll of where the average citizen would place these \\"usual\\" suspects on a scale of 1 to 100.<br /><br />This is a must read for anyone who is fed up with the intellectual and hollywood elites.	2005-07-28

Rowling would lose her way in book 6 and book 7.  Based on what I read in The Half-Blood Prince (book 6) my worry and concern was wasted.  Rowling does a masterful job in moving the storyline along.  She continues to weave the story and characters into a spell binding story, and sets us up for book 7 which I believe will be a worthy capstone to this record breaking series.  Rowling has truly set a high mark not just for children's literature, but for the craft of storytelling in general.<br /><br />Harry is older, wiser, and less troublesome than he was in book 5.  Hermione, Ron, Ginny, and the rest of the cast are present.  There have been some changes but you'll see those for yourselves if you invest the time to read the book.  At 652 pages, The Half-Blood Prince will take a while to read, but the time you invest will be well worth it.  I'm still in awe of the world Rowling has created.  The small details of that world that she shares with the reader are still amazing to me.<br /><br />The only negative I can see, and this is a weak one, is that book 6 is not a stand alone read.  There are constant references to previous books in the series.  I can't help but feel that any reader who picks up this book before reading the first 5 will be somewhat lost.  At the very least the references to previous events will be lost on the newcomer.<br /><br />The Half-Blood Prince is a terrific read.  Get a copy and enjoy.	2005-07-26

Crusader's Cross by James Lee Burke is yet another view into the seedy world of New Orleans and its environs.  Burke is a master at writing gritty tales that capture the flavor and spirit of the world he depicts.  I know of no other author today that is as good a descriptive writer than Burke.  When Burke describes a summer thunderstorm you can smell the dampness rising off the pavement.  Pure magic.  Burke has included Dave's good friend and PI buddy Clete Purcell (Semper Fi), so the gangs all here.<br /><br />In Crusader's Cross Dave Robicheaux is alone, and unemployed.  His wife is dead, his adopted daughter away at college.  Robicheaux is about as low as you can get.  A death bed confession takes Robicheaux back to the late 50's when he and his brother were very innocent.  As Robicheaux presses into the disappearance of a young prostitute nearly 50 years ago he is \\"encouraged\\" to let it go.  Factor into this story the Chalon family (brother and sister) and you have the makings of a real south Louisianna clam bake.<br /><br />Crusader's Cross is rich with atmosphere.  The story is full bodied and the characters memorable.  This is a terrific summer read.	2005-07-12

Through various plot twists, Tempe and her main squeeze Andrew Ryan end up in Israel overtly investigating Ferris' murder.  However, through their investigation, they end up involved in a mystery involving what appear to be first century bones that may be from the family of Christ.<br /><br />Written in pure Reich's style, Cross Bones, is, as pointed out by another reviewer, similar in tone and pace to Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code.  However, unlike Brown's suspenseful novel, Cross Bones fails to carry the reader to the same level of mystery and intrigue that fills The Da Vinci Code.  Don't misunderstand my point.  Cross Bones is a worthwhile read, but try as she might, Reichs' can't duplicate Browns success.<br /><br />The characters in Cross Bones are believeable but not always interesting.  The plot is a bit convoluted and in places stretches the reader a little too far.<br /><br />Cross Bones is an interesting read but not typical Reichs.	2005-06-28

Both deal with critical periods in Egyptian history and both are credits to their authors.<br /><br />Oden's Men of Bronze is more earthy than The Egyptian and certainly more graphic.  The premise of internal decay within Egypt and external pressure from Persia is a common theme.  I thought the primary character of Hasdrabal Barca, a commited and driven soldier dedicated to the Pharoah and his dynasty was captivating.  Phanes, the Greek traitor was equally memorable but for different reasons.  Even given the slow start, as pointed out by another reviewer, isn't enough to prevent me from highly recommending this book.<br /><br />Men of Bronze is a rapidly paced story that will leave you with memorable images in your head.  I highly recommend this book.	2005-06-21

Jeffrey Deaver and his stories are greatly anticipated by many of our patrons.<br /><br />In The Twelfth Card teenager Geneva Settle is attacked and nearly killed while doing research in a library in the City.  Chased by the assailant she narrowly escapes.  She eventually ends up in front of Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs where she is debriefed and put in protective custody.  It is this part of the book that seems contrived.  Lincoln Rhyme is a high powered piece of manpower.  If he were used to investigate every suspected assault on a teenager he wouldn't have any time for other crimes.  Of course WE know that there is a major crime to be prevented/solved because we can see the book. However, Lincoln doesn't know that this isn't just what it looks like, a possible attempted sexual assault.<br /><br />Aside from this minor point, The Twelfth Card is everything we have come to expect from Jeffrey Deaver.  The Twelfth Card is a great story with more than its share of plot twists.  The plot is believable and keeps the readers turning the pages.<br /><br />Finally, Deaver continues to offer fresh stories that rely on good authorship.  This is refreshing considering some of the trite and contrived novels being published by other authors.	2005-06-07

Some times they seem almost to be gods stepped down from Mt. Olympus.  In The Last Generation, Peter Carmichael manages to shed new light onto the lives, interests, and beliefs of many of the young Virginians that were so caught up in the cause of the day and in the process makes them human once more.<br /><br />I found The Last Generation to be full of information that is new...at least to me.  I've done my share of reading about the major characters involved in the Civil War, on both sides.  Yet Carmichael seems to provide the reader with new insights on almost every page.<br /><br />I also found the tables in the appendix to be full of useful and eye opening facts.  Trust me, they're worth the time it takes to study them.  Finally, I spent more time than usual studying the notes provided by Carmichael, a compliment of the first order.<br /><br />For the casual or serious Civil War buff, The Last Generation will be a memorable read.	2005-06-01

He hopes that by surrounding himself with this material he will be able to regain his memory.<br /><br />Eco is a superbly rick novelist.  His stories are made up of various layers, each supporting and enhancing the other.  The characters are memorable, the story well weaved.  Even his setting, Solara is a treat.  I can't help but believe that part of the difficulty in reading his work is due to the translating.  Certainly Eco is several levels above most of his contemporaries.

Fast paced, lots of twists and false leads, passion, love, and danger.  Yup, Cook at his best.<br /><br />In Marker, mysterious deaths follow routine and not very serious surgeries even though the victims are young and healthy.  In fact, enough of these deaths occur to attract the attention of Laurie Montgomery, a New York City medical examiner.  Laurie becomes convinced that something is amiss and does her best to enlist the help of Jack Stapleton, who she has a bit of a relationship with.<br /><br />With the medical mystery as the primary focus, Cook also manages to further develop the love affair between Laurie and Jack who is, if anything, luke warm about a full blown relationship.<br /><br />Since reading Coma, I have been an avid Cook fan.  Lets face it, Cook gives us what we read fiction for...a good yarn, believable characters, intelligent plots, and enough twists to keep a taffy factory going for years.<br /><br />You'll love this book.	2005-05-24

There are certain periods of history that never seem to become tired or dull regardless of how often they are written about.  It seems that each new investigator finds some thing new to write about.  The American Revolution is a case in point.  A quick check of books in print will convince you.<br /><br />David McCullough's 1776 is a terrific investigation into the beginning of the American Revolution.  Is it perfect?  NO.  It does have some missing pieces.  But these minor defects are just that...minor.  If you look at the complete work, I think you'll find that what 1776 lacks is made up for by McCulloughs ability to deliver the main facts on time and in a way the reader can grasp.<br /><br />As in John Adams, McCullough again finds the ability to make the main characters jump off the page.  Washington, a figure that history has rightfully made larger than life is once again a human man, tortured with doubts and always mindful that disaster is just around the corner.  I especially like the treatment that McCullough give King George III.<br /><br />As a reader, I always like reading a book that moves along.  McCullough's narrative does that quite well.  In fact, some of the flaws that other reviewers have rightfully pointed out seem to spring from this style of writing.<br /><br />Well researched and paced for the non-historian, 1776 is a winner.  When all is said and done, you'll find that 1776 is worth the time you'll spend reading it.	2005-05-24

I wasn't aware until just a month ago that this project was underway.  I can't say how thrilled I am.  I agree with another reviewer, however, that two volumes a year isn't fast enough.<br /><br />Reading this volume has brought back many feelings I had as a child growing up.  Of course, I was only 7 and 8 when these appeared and I don't believe I had discovered Peanuts yet.  However, they are a comment on the time in which they were written, 1955 and 1956.  I think at some point in the far, far future, history students may be assigned reading various volumes of this effort to get a flavor for the time they were written. I also think that publishing them in their original order is wonderful.  I'm not sure that the original chronology has been followed before.<br /><br />This book, the previous volumes and all that follow are for those of us that are diehard, dedicated Peanuts fans.  Reading this volume has also made me appreciate just how rich our lives have been because of talented creators like Charles Schulz.  I can't wait for the next one.	2005-04-28

My previous reads included Who's On First, Marco Polo (my favorite), and Mongoose.  I look forward to reading these stories, but the amount of required reading I must do leaves little time.  I must say, that Last Call for Blackford Oakes is a superb ending for such an outstanding spy.  Buckley does a terrific job spinning the tale.  I've always believed that Buckley writes his novels for the reader and never fails to deliver.<br /><br />Its 1987 and Oakes is sent to the Soviet Union to prevent yet another assination attempt on Mr. Gorbachev.  While he saves the hapless premier yet again, his life becomes complicated by a romantic interlude with Usina Chadinov, a Russian doctor, and also the continuation of his life and death struggle with Kim Philby his sworn enemy.<br /><br />Like most of Buckley's books, both fiction and nonfiction, his use of the English language is wonderful.  Buckley is to the point.  He weaves a wonderful story that will keep you turning the pages.  Even the slow start is quickly overcome.<br /><br />I certainly hope that somehow, the series will continue.	2005-04-28

Slowly, as Tomm tries to put together the basic obit info, he realizes that this is no ordinary person.<br /><br />Thus begins The Geographer's Library by Jon Fasman.  The story is interesting from the very beginning.  Fasman does a terrific job bouncing back and forth between Paul Tomm's investigation and earlier periods important to the story.  He also introduces the reader to each of the items once belonging to Al-Idrisi, a twelth century philosopher, cartographer, linguist and all-round learned fellow working for King Roger of Sicily.  The items, at one time had been belonged to Al-Idrisi but had been stolen and scattered throughout the world.  Slowly, and painfully for some, the items are being gathered....<br /><br />Its not until the end that we finally get the information we need to make complete sense of it all, but then isn't that the way of most novels?<br /><br />I for one, enjoyed reading The Geographer's Library.  Jon Fasman's characters are believable within the context of the story.  The pacing of the story is a little slow in places, but the book held my attention.<br /><br />I fully recommend The Geographer's Library.	2005-04-15

This is my first Andrews novel and it now appears that I have some catching up to do with his earlier novels; Gideon, Icarus, and Aphrodite.<br /><br />In Midas we witness an apparent terrorist bombing in a small Long Island restaurant killing everyone inside, including the current Sheriff, Jimmy Leggett.  The new sheriff Justin Westwood is soon on the case.  Before he can make much progress with the bombing, a plane crash draws him into another investigation.  Eventually he suspects the two events are connected.  The rest of the book is a roller coaster ride.  Of particular interest for some readers will be the pages dealing with Guantanomo Bay....<br /><br />Well written, with great characters in a fast paced story, Midas is worth the time it takes to read.  I suspect others will continue to discover Russell Andrews and I certainly will look for new books from him in the future.	2005-04-05

I found the book to be troubling from a couple of perspectives.  First, that American politicians and civil service workers would work on Iran's behalf against the interest of our country.  I thought American government workers should work for us.  Secondly, that we have danced around the issue of Iran for so long....more than 20 years and continue to do so.<br /><br />I don't want to start a spitting contest with other reviewers.  I think when you review a book, your review should be about the worthiness of the book from your own perspective.  To be branded racist because you think the book makes sense or doesn't make sense shouldn't be allowed by Amazon.<br /><br />Iran continues to be a thorn in the side of the United States, Europe, and other Middle Eastern countries.  That Iran has a full blown nuclear program isn't questioned.  What their ultimate purpose is is.  I thought Atomic Iran was well written, interesting and certainly provocative.  Americans should read the book with an open mind and ponder the possibilities and what they mean to this country.<br /><br />I certainly thought Atomic Iran was interesting.  Isn't that one of the reasons we read such books?	2005-04-04

I did think the title of the book was a bit misleading.  As other reviewers have pointed out, about one half of the the book deals with the southern campaign.  What little time is devoted to the actual Yorktown engagement is broken up by frequent wanderings into other areas, some relevant, others not.  I was also a bit disappointed by the very skimpy coverage devoted to the diplomatic dealings going on during the Yorktown battle.  The book, entertaining as it was, could really have improved had more attention been given to the surrender negotiations.<br /><br />Even with this criticisms I highly recommend Victory at Yorktown.	2005-03-18

It is not a book that breaks new ground.  As pointed out by another reviewer, the stories of the Greeks, Copernicus, Kepler, Brahe, and Einstein are well known by anyone not new to the topic of Cosmology.  However, that being said, I think the book is a worthwhile read anyway.  Certainly, as an amature anstronomer I think the book belongs on ones shelf for reference if for no other reason.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone that has an interest in the Cosmos.  It's written for the lay person and for that reason gets my recommendation.	2005-03-17

My only familiarity with Chaucer is that I read the Canterbury Tales when I was in the Marines, and again in College (I enjoyed my earlier introduction to Chaucer much more than the latter).  My eye got caught by the title of the book.  Having been drawn in on a potential \\"murder\\" of a poet, I was hooked as soon as I started reading.<br /><br />I realized pretty quickly after starting the book that it was more an examination of the period of Richard II than it was a murder mystery.  I wasn't disappointed.  In fact, I now know there is not any evidence that Chaucer met with an evil end for political or other reasons.  The fact that Chaucer just disappears from the public record is intriguing and it is this fact that Jones builds his story around.<br /><br />Jones is a terrific author of history.  I found Who Murdered Chaucer to be easy to read and engaging.  I was reminded just a bit of Barbara Tuchman's A Distant Mirror in how the the book moved through its subject.  Jones' writing style also reminds me of the french historian Fernand Braudel.<br /><br />Terry Jones is obviously highly versed in his subject.  The love of his topic becomes apparent on the lines of each page.<br /><br />I highly recommend Who Murdered Chaucer by Terry Jones.	2005-02-25

I've read Mary Doria Russells other books, The Sparrow and Children of God and enjoyed both.  I was a bit skeptical when I read the jacket material on Thread of Grace.  Well, I should have known better.  Thread of Grace is a tremendously well written and well researched novel.  You will remember reading this book far into the future.<br /><br />Thread of Grace is well written but very busy with crossing storylines.  You may indeed need a list to keep things straight.  Ms Russell pays great attention to detail in both her description of the physical location of the story (NW Italy) and in the characters she includes in the story.  It is this detail that may overwhelm the casual reader.<br /><br />The premise of the story, that there is a safe haven in Italy for Jews as they try to hide from their ultimate slaughter by the Nazi's is a compelling one.  And it is true.  The characters, a Jewish Rabbi, a Catholic Priest, the Italians of the region, and the Germans (collectively) face the moral and ethical dilemma all humans face in war.  Russell does an excellect job dealing with the whole war/morality issue without preaching one way or the other.<br /><br />Truly a worthwhile book.  Get it and read it.  I suspect we'll hear from Russell again.	2005-02-10

Bunk.  I found Charen's book Do-Gooders to be engaging, insightful, and pretty much right on target.  I have thought for years that the left in this country was willing to run over anyone in order to achieve their aims.  Charen proves the point over and over again.  I hardly see how anyone can argue with her evidence.<br /><br />Frankly, I'm surprised someone else hasn't written this book before....like ten years ago.<br /><br />If you're an independent thinker then this is a book you'll want to read.	2005-02-03

Not being a diehard Lescroart fan, I picked up The Motive because I didn't have anything else to read.  My previous experience with Lescroart's fiction is restricted to Sunburn and The Vig.  I don't remember any of the specifics of those books, but I do remember not being impressed.  I must say, however, that The Motive may put Lescroart firmly on my must read list.<br /><br />Two bodies are discovered in an obvious arson fire.  They are the bodies of Paul Hanover and his steady sweet heart Missy D'Amiens and they didn't die in the fire.  Detective Cuneo is called in to investigate and it isn't long before his ineptness becomes obvious.  To get a handle on the case the Mayor calls in Abe Glitsky.  Dismas Hardy becomes involved when he is asked by Catherine Hanover (an old flame from his college days) when she is targeted by the police as a primary suspect.  The best part of this book is watching Glitsky and Hardy work their magic.<br /><br />The Motive, as other reviewers have pointed out is a great \\"who done it\\" and a terrific courtroom drama all rolled into one.<br /><br />Trust me, you'll read this book quickly.	2005-01-21

I have just met one of the most original characters I've ever had the pleasure (and sometimes displeasure) of reading about.  Smithy Ide is one of those individuals that seem to float through life taking whatever is dished out and not really caring.  At least on the surface.  At 43 he's managed to dedicate himself to a meaningless job.  Hes an a drunk that weighs 279 pounds and loves the sofa and the television.  He has few friends and fewer prospects at a better life.  Then all that changes.  His parents are killed and then learns that his mentally ill sister has also died.<br /><br />In one of the most original plots I've read in a while, Smithy embarks on a trip of healing and discovery on his bike.  Traveling across county he meets one unique person after another.<br /><br />McLarty has written a truly moving story.  His character, perhaps mentally ahead of Forest Gump, still has the sweetness that Gump possessed.<br /><br />You'll enjoy this book and may find yourself poking your way through it to make the experience last.	2005-01-19

I continue to marvel at the people that feel Koontz has made some fatal mistake by letting his writing evolve and grow in an organic way.  As I have said before, any author that continues to write in the same manner that they used twenty years ago will cease to find a growing audience.  Koontz is writing great stories today because he has allowed himself to develop as an author.<br /><br />Life Expectancy sets up an unusual situation.  A dying man predicts five important days in the life of his grandson who is being born as he makes his predictions.  The old man dies, literally as his grandson draws him first breath.  Koontz delivers a suspenseful story for each of the five days that is surprising, and gripping.  I won't ruin the story by telling you how it all works out.  Suffice it to say that there are twists and turns that will keep you turning the page.<br /><br />Koontz tells great stories.  His characters are well developed as is his plot line.<br /><br />I think you'll enjoy Life Expectancy as long as you don't want a Koontz book that is a formula from the 80's.<br /><br />Peace	2005-01-10

I don't know how I missed A Salty Piece of Land when it came out last month but I did.  Well, the book found its way to me and I've read it and I have to recommend it to you.<br /><br />Jimmy Buffett is a talented performer, and a terrific song writer.  Some doubt his talent as a novelist, but after reading a Salty Piece of Land I honestly don't know how they can doubt his storytelling ability.  The characters in this book are wonderful and unforgettable.  Perhaps the most interesting beside Tully himself is Cleopatra Highbourne.  Okay, as a 103 ships captain she does stretch credibility, but why should she?  The story line does get thin in places, but doesn't that happen in real life from time to time?  I mean, we all have periods in our lives that are thin and un-interesting.<br /><br />You should find this book a worthwhile read.  The story is believable, the characters interesting, the story grabbing enough to keep you turning the page.  What else do you want?	2005-01-06

Well, that day has come.  It is no secret that Clive's son, Dirk, is reponsible for a good part of Black Wind.  But that's ok.  It's in the genes.<br /><br />A wonderful plot and storyline supports Black Wind.  Sunken Japanese submarines carrying a nasty bio-weapon intended for use in the closing days of WWII are discovered by a South Korean businessman secretly working for North Korea.  The intent is to mount the deadly germs on a rocket and aim in at Los Angeles.  Such an event would devastate the population of the United States and change the balance of power in the world...perhaps forever.<br /><br />You know that our heros can't allow such an event to happen....and they don't.  That's the best part of the book and I won't reveal any secrets.<br /><br />A fast paced story with wonderful scenes, great characters, and a great ending makes Black Wind a great holiday read.  If you don't want to buy, give your public library some business and check it out there.  You'll save some money, and your library will appreaciate your visit.	2004-12-31
US	52872630	RPTEVGVUXY1HC	0066214130	57180289	State of Fear	Books	5	20	27	N	N	More than just a terrific Novel	I found Michael Crichton's novel State of Fear to be engaging, richly textured, well written, well researched and full of surprises.  The characters and dialog are believable as is the plot of the book.  Again, Crichton manages to master a technically complicated topic and better yet, make it understandable to a mass audience.<br /><br />The premise of the book, that environmental terrorists want to cause a major environmental event and disaster certainly isn't beyond my belief system.  There are many groups out there that have one axe to grind or another.  These groups, whether political, religious, or social in nature will stop at nothing to make their point.  We all saw this on Sept. 11.  That a group of enviromentally alert and aware individuals want to make a statement and have an impact on policy makers' radar screens certainly isn't beyond credibility.  I found State of Fear to be reasonable.  I also believe that the world wide environmental movement has been, in some cases, co-opted by violent people. We've also seen this in other movements.<br /><br />I'm also impressed when I pick up a work of fiction that comes with two appendices and a bibliography.  How strange is that?  I also appreciated the authors note at the end of the book.<br /><br />State of Fear is 603 pages of pure Crichton.  You'll probably enjoy the book.  Certainly if you've read other Crichton novels you won't be surprised by what you read.  The added bonus in this case is that you'll also be a better informed citizen of both this country and the world.	2004-12-29

While I might not agree that this is his \\"greatest\\" work yet I also don't agree that it is his worst.  Straub, like Dean Koontz, must be read and then pondered.  Reading any of Straub's books like one would reads a comic book is a waste of time and a waste of money.<br /><br />In the Night Room starts off with two separate story lines.  It is not until later in the book that the reader realizes that one is real and one not.  I thought at first that Straub was uncharacteristically weak in how he developed the Willy Bryce Patrick character but this lack of detail is intentional.  In fact, the lack of specifics about Willy is essential to the plot.<br /><br />The book moves quite rapidly.  The pursuit of Tim Underhill and Willy by Mitchell Faber's henchmen moves the storyline nicely toward climax.  Readers should know that In the Night Room is a continuation of the story started in Lost Boy, Lost Girl.  This book will make more sense if you've read the first book.  Many readers who grab In the Night Room as their first Straub book may be unnecessarily disappointed.<br /><br />Straub usually develops his stories slowly.  In the Night Room is a much quicker read.  Straub is also one of the best writers in developing his characters as they relate to the plot.  You get what you need but nothing more.<br /><br />In the Night Room is a worthwhile read.  While not a Ghost Story, it is a gripping story.	2004-12-28

I've read every major work he has written at least once and several (The Stand and The Shining) multiple times.  My admiration for King as an author only grows with time.  I, like many others, got caught up in the Dark Tower series because of his past record as a storyteller.  Well, I'm glad I read the series, and I'm particularly glad that I completed the last book.  Like several other of Kings books, I had to stop reading somewhere in the middle to read something else....a job requirement.  I always came back to book seven.<br /><br />I liked the way the series ended.  When I think about the ending I realize anyother ending would have seemed too convenient.  After all, Roland is still out there....still on the quest.  I was just a little disappointed in how easily the Crimson King was dealt with.  Not to have an epic battle between light and darkness did seem contrived as a few other reviewers have pointed out.<br /><br />Peeling away the band of faithful characters like the layers of an onion is a brilliant way to allow the reader to focus on Roland and the completion of  his quest.  I don't want to ruin the story for those who will wait for the paperback, but trust me, the way Eddie, Jake, Oy, and Susannah were dealt with in the final book seemed natural and organic to the story.<br /><br />I continue to marvel at King's endless well of material.  I am a \\"faithful\\" reader.	2004-12-22

Lavishly done with rich, full color, well done photographs, Chariots is a feast for the eyes.  Cubans, it seems, have maintained hundreds of vintage American cars while most of the world has \\"moved on.\\"  Cut off from the American car market, Cubans, once the largest importer of Detroit automobiles, have been forced to nurse along what they have.  Whether equipping these cars with Russian truck engines, hand forging their own replace parts, or taking parts from cars no longer able to keep rolling, the Cubans of the last half of the twentieth century have proven themselves very adept at improving.  This book is as much a tribute to their resourcefulness as it is to the cars pictured between the covers.<br /><br />If you're a lover of things old and wonderful photography then Chariots of Chrome is the book for you.  You'll also come to respect the mechanical genius of the Cuban car owner and mechanic.	2004-08-18

I do want to recommend Pfanz's Gettysburg: The Second Day to any serious student of the Gettysburg battle.  The book is well written, readable, and certainly logical in the order the battle is covered.  The maps are more than helpful and well thought out, but as one other reviewer points out are late in their introduction.  The book is detailed without getting bogged down is useless facts.  The author obviously knows what he's writing about and certainly his passion for the topic shines through.  Pfanz managers the minute to minute changes on the battlefield and the often complicated troop/unit movements with ease and without losing the reader.  The author manages to introduce personal accounts where he feels they can add to the narrative.  This is a superb work and it may never be surpassed.	2004-08-05

Well, I'm in my mid 50's, and I still listen to hard rock, but getting old isn't cool, but it is inevitable, and that requires &quot;attitude.&quot;<br /><br /> Robert Levine, M. D. in Aging with Attitude: Growing Older with Dignity and Vitality lays out an entertaining, informative, and logical look at aging. Dr. Levine devotes chapters coving the aging process itself, the various diseases associated with aging, how genes often determine the rate of deterioration of physical ability in different individuals, and how society often writes off the aged. Those chapters may depress you but never fear. Help is on the way. He points out that staying active, whether by exercising or by simply getting involved with a cause can keep the mind and body healthier. Levine also looks at strategies to counter some of the difficulties the aging face. Levine simply says that aging is &quot;the great equalizer&quot;. It effects the &quot;rich, powerful, or famous, brilliant or average intellect, middle-class strivers or impoverished welfare recipients...&quot; Finally Dr. Levine gazes at the time horizon and speculates on aging in the future.<br /><br /> All things considered Aging with Attitude is a helpful book to read. It begins to prepare the reader for the natural process of aging. Afterall, to know ones enemy is to be able to defeat him. While I doubt any of us will defeat aging, we can better understand it.	2004-07-31

Her stories have gotten better in the intervening years....more depth to her characters, including Tempe, more depth to her stories, great plot lines, and a steady pace that keeps the reader hanging on.  I agree with other reviewers that Monday Mourning is her strongest work yet....but all of her books are worth reading.<br />Tempe is in Montreal to testify in a murder case (what else).  While she is there, she is called to investigate three skeletons discovered in the basement of a small pizza parlor.  Upon first impressions there is some thought that the bodies are &quot;historical&quot;, and this is supported when 19th century evidence is discovered near the remains.  However, Tempe isn't convinced.  She carbon dates the remains and discovers that they day to the 1980's confirming her fears.<br />As background we discover that Tempe's love life isn't going well.  Her significant other isn't giving her the attention she needs.  Further, her male co-workers continue to take her and her contributions to police work lightly.<br />Suffice it to say that the reader is in store for another wonderful ride through fictional police work.  A tight story with great characters, Monday Mourning is sure to make you a Reichs fan if you're not already there.	2004-07-19

The assignment seems straightforward enough, but as in most of Grafton's novels, the obvious should never be relied upon too strongly and often what seems to be simple on first blush often turns out to be complicated.  It isn't very long before the simple assignment turns difficult especially as some of Reba's old friends begin to make their appearance.<br />Well written....written with the reader in mind....R is for Ricochet will keep you turning pages.  Not Grafton's strongest work (I liked Q is for Quarry better), R is certainly worth the time you'll spend reading it.  I wonder what S will be?	2004-07-19

A novelist that is yet to become well known, she gets up and goes to her computer to work.  Her attention is pulled away by an unuaually heavy rain.  Investigating she discovers some oddities...the rain has a glow to it and an odor that manages to convey a sense of uncleanliness.  Coyotes appear on her porch and show no fear of her when she walks among them.  It is as if they fear whats in the rain more than their natural distrust of humans.  Neil, her husband is awakened by a nightmare. Together, the two sense the danger they are in and flee into the night and enter a reality that stresses their perception of reality to the breaking point.<br />Dean Koontz in The Taking manages to create a mood so overwhelming that the reader is immediately transformed into one of the helpless characters in the story.  I had the good fortune to read the first seventy or so pages in a driving rain storm.  This multimedia experience certainly enhanced my identification with the general oppressive mood of the novel.  If you can, delay reading the book until a rain storm appears.  No, disregard that.  Read the book as soon as you can....don't delay the experience.  The author's love of words and the english language continue to be demonstrated in The Taking.  The story is tight with a minumum of wasted motion.<br />Koontz continues to develop his skills as a storyteller.  Some readers, it appears, expect him to write in the same way he did in his earlier works.  These individuals ignore the fact that even novelists develop over time.  The writers method of developing a story may never change, but the results of the process do change....do evolve.  There is no question that the Koontz of the '90's is different from the present day author.  I for one am enjoying the transition.	2004-06-07

Washington's Crossing is written by a historian that loves to tell stories.  Fischer apparently loves to write because he does it so well and his book is full of footnotes, notes and maps; enough to keep any second rate amature historian happy for weeks.<br />Fischer's attention to the details associated with the principles of the story is also impressive.  Even the private soldier isn't overlooked.  The trials and tribulations of Washington and his army are well documented by Fischer.  Reading this book drives home the sacrifice made by so many of the citizens of the wonderful country.  Fischer's coverage of the &quot;enemy&quot; especially that of Cornwallis is also impressive.<br />For any reader looking for a true picture of the early days of the American Revolution, Washington's Crossing is for you.	2004-05-25

Whether you're a historical buff or a devotee of the game of chess, you'll find something in Birth of the Chess Queen to make you happy.<br />Marilyn Yalom is a superb writer.  After reading The History of the Wife I quickly placed her is the same category as Barbara Tuchman (A Distant Mirror) in that she writes for the reader, not herself.  It is obvious that Yalom loves to do research since her books are so well founded in fact.<br />The Birth of the Chess Queen chronicles the development of chess through its earliest history.  Following the development from India, through Persia, and eventually southern Europe, Yalom illustrates how the game adapted as it spread.  I found the fact that the Queen wasn't always included on the board facinating.  Yalom's description of how the Queen might have gained acceptance certainly makes sense.  Her explortation of major characters, both men and women, that might have impacted the development and spread of the game is also interesting.<br />I highly recommend The Birth of the Chess Queen.  I can hardly wait for Yalom's next book.	2004-05-25

I suspect that it was inevitable that with the success of Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code it was only a matter of time before the copy-cats began showing up.  Secrets of the Code by Dan Burstein isn't exactly like a copy-cat, but it does bang on the points made by Brown.  In fact, this is really the fourth book dealing with some aspect of Grail mythology.....<br />Burstein has pulled together contributors from a wide range of disciplines....archaeology, art history, religion, philosopy among others.  While I don't recognize the contibutors, we are led to believe that they represent of leaders in their respective fields.<br />If you've been captivated by Browns book, then Secrets of the Code is a must read for you.  A quick look around book stores or public libraries will reveal a wide range of other books on the general topics of Mary Magdalene, the Holy Grail, and Templar mythology....but honestly, Secrets of the Code is among the best.<br />Dan Browns Da Vinci Code is probably one of the most controversial books to appear since I've been dealing with the reading public as a librarian.  Secrets of the Code, if read and heeded, will give you the facts you need to debate Browns book intelligently.<br />Get the book....read it.	2004-05-11

Not light reading, The Fabric of the Cosmos stirs the imagination and is worth the effort it takes to read it.<br />Brian Greene is not new to trying to make modern science understandable to the lay reader.  His prior effort, The Elegant Universe:  Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory spent several weeks on the New York Times best seller list.  While the Elegant Universe was readable to someone without much training in science, it took some study and reflection to try and grasp some of Greene's explanations.  The Fabric of the Cosmos is similar to The Elegant Universe in that regard.  You won't be able to cruise through it like a Grisham novel.<br />There are some interesting discussions in The Fabric of the Cosmos.  Why, for example, does time apparently run in only one direction (Chapter 6)?  Or, what went bang when the big bang banged (Chapter 10)?  He devotes all of Chapter 15 to the discussion of time travel and the use of teleporters as they relate to modern physics.  It is this willingness on Greene's part ot reach out to the common reader in ways that are interesting to us and makes his books so valuable.  In many ways, he reminds me a great deal of the late Carl Sagan.  Sagan had the ability to reach out to those of us who are untrained in science but still have the thirst to know about the greater universe surrounding us.<br />If you're looking for a good, sturdy read, then this is the book for you.	2004-03-16

Hornfischer has written a superb book on a little known naval battle that may stand as one of the most heroic efforts by the United States Navy in it's long and illustrious history.  The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors focuses on a period of a few days in October 1944, during a time when the invasion of the Philippines was just underway and the Japanese Navy was doing all it could to hurl the American invasion back into the sea.<br />Early on the morning of October 25, 1944 Taffy 3, made up of six U.S. escort carriers and a screen of eight destroyers stumbled into a vastly superior Japanese naval force made up of four battleships, eight cruisers, and eleven destroyers.  The Japanese fleet was within range of the American force virtually before either group was aware of the presence of the other.  The Japanese began bombarding Taffy 3 almost immediately.  To save the carriers, the small force of American destroyers and destroyer escorts throw themselves at the Japanese task force believing that by sacrificing themselves they can buy precious time for the American carriers and allow them to flee southward toward another grouping of friendly ships.  Naval aviators from Taffy 3 also do all they can to thwart the on rushing Japanese, but many planes are launched quickly from the carriers armed with the wrong type of ordinance.  Still, between the attacking aircraft and destroyers, they manage to slow, at least temporarily, the Japanese fleet.  In the end three American destroyers are sunk and nearly 1000 sailors and airmen die.<br />Though the battle was small two huge firsts took place on October 25, 1944.  The first and only American aircraft carrier was sunk by enemy naval surface gun fire.  Also, October 25 marked the first successful kamikaze attack of World War II.<br />Well written and well researched The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors will be an easy read...it is gripping and a page turner.  One aspect that Hornfischer is clear on is the cause of the battle.  He clearly feels that Halsey must bear most of the blame for this near disaster.  Halsey was guarding the northern flank of Taffy 3.  Though the attack that nearly distroyed Taffy 3 came from the West, Halsey was not in position to give assistance since he had run off to the north looking for a rumored grouping of Japanese aircraft carriers.<br />Disaster was averted to be sure, but only because of the heroism of the skippers of three destroyers and their crews.<br />If you're a history lover then you'll love this book.e battle.

Harris delivers a wonderful reading experience in Pompeii.  The story of young engineer Marcus Attilius is certainly plausible.<br />Young Attilius takes over responsibility of the Aqua Augusta, the aqueduct that delivers water to Pompeii and other cities in and around the Bay of Naples.  When the small city of Misenum stops receiving water via the aqueduct young Attilius convinces Pliny the Elder to let him investigate.  When Attilius arrives at Vesuvius he realizes that much more than water delivery is at stake.<br />Thrown against the background of history, Harris manages to spin a story of human interest that is at once captivating.  Against the history of the time Harris develops characters that are immediately believable and sheds light on a culture that is doomed both immediately and in the longterm.  His writing is economical which is refreshing.<br />A very intriguing story that is well researched.  You won't be sorry you read it.	2003-12-15

It has been a long time since anything like it has appeared on the shelves in American bookstores.<br />Within hours of the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese strike at Wake Island.  Thinly defended by a few companies of Marines and a very small Marine Air Squadron VMF-211, Wake Island was in the process of being fortified.  Beside the small military detachment, there was large numbers of civilian construction crews on the Island that were sent to Wake to build various bunkers, hospitals, and barracks.  PanAm also has a facility on Wake to service it's clippers that stop periodically on there way to the orient and back again.  It is this small population of Americans that must face the Japanese assault that has not met defeat yet.<br />Bill Sloan is a master storyteller.  In Given Up for Dead he tells the story in a way that will stir your admiration for the defenders, both military and civilian.  He uses standard sources but also mixes in information from the few survivors that are still alive.  Primary sources, especially eye witness accounts, form the backbone of this book.<br />Ultimately the American Marines are forced to surrender, but not until they give the Japanese a preview of what's in store for them in the subsequent months.  It was the Marines at Wake Island that stopped the Japanese for the first time.  It was also the Marines of Wake Island that sank the first Japanese naval vessel of WWII.<br />This is a pivotal book both in the history of the Marine Corps and the history of WWII.  If you're a history buff then you'll want this book on your own bookshelf.	2003-12-10

Odd Thomas is a suspenseful, powerful, imaginative, and entertaining story.  The characters are believable and seem to leap off the page at the reader.  Of course, I like all of Koontz's works, the early stuff and his later, more spiritual works.<br />Odd Thomas is a short order hash slinger in a small out of the way town of Pico Mundo.  Besides being a talented writer, Odd sees and communicates with ghosts.  Not just any ghosts mind you, but all types of ghosts.  One type that is especially bad are the &quot;bodachs&quot; a particularly malevolent spirit that is attracted to and seem to feed off of violence. These spirits are in town and associated with a character Odd names &quot;Fungus Man.&quot;  As you read you realize that Fungus Man is much, much more than he appears on the surface to be.<br />This is an unsettling read.  Koontz manages to keep the reader slightly off balance.  This causes a little disorientation and some readers may be critical on this aspect of the novel.  However, when you reach the end of the book you'll be glad that you hung around to the end.<br />Koontz is a talented writer.  His books are meant for intelligent readers.  Odd Thomas will not disappoint.	2003-12-10

I found Alexander's The Bounty to be generally well researched and fairly presented.  As one other reviewer correctly points out, she is uneven in places.  However, given the nature of the subject and the fact that she is dealing with 200 year old documents, themselves probably uneven, The Bounty is certainly worth the time it will take to read it.<br />The story is familiar.  The Bounty, commanded by Bligh, is sent to Tahiti to collect breadfruit specimens for the West Indies.  Christian, Bligh's friend and former shipmate is invited to sail by Bligh.  The crew, seemingly more educated than the average British naval crew, is somehow changed by their visit to the island paradise.  And why not.  Bligh is an easy commander given the norms of the day.  Alexander points this out by comparing the number of lashes handed out by Bligh over the entire length of the voyage of the Bounty to the number of lashes given out by the commander of the HMS Hector during the time of the trial of the mutineers.  Bligh loses.  In fact she points out that Bligh, while having a sharp tongue was a kind and caring leader.  It is, perhaps, this kindness that is perceived as weakness by the crew.<br />Read the book and make up your own mind.<br />Caroline Alexander proved her metal when she undertook to write the definitive book on the Endurance.  She is a first class researcher and a wonderful writer.  She again proves herself with The Bounty.<br />Read the book and then watch the movie, the one with Mel Gibson.<br />The other two movies dealing with this topic are a waste.	2003-10-16

There are other first hand accounts of combat and general living conditions faced by soldiers of both sides....far too many to elaborate here.  However, there is something touching almost beyond words about the letters young Benjamin &quot;Webb&quot; Baker wrote his mother.<br />Benson Bobrick does a good job in weaving Webb's (Bobrick's great-grandfather) letters into a coherent narrative about the war.  The narrative covers Webb's entire enlistment period from 1861 to his discharge in 1864.  Civil War buffs will recognize the battles included:  Pea Ridge, Perryville, Stone's River, Chickamauga, and finally the Atlanta victory.  Perhaps of equal value are the letters themselves, neatly placed into an appendix at the end of the book...each included in their entirety for the casual reader to pour over and ponder.<br />Its all here, the descriptions of battle, of camp life, of marching,...insights into the officers that lead these men, and a general view of the times.  The letters read true as anyone who has served in the military will recognize.  Red tape is red tape no matter the century.<br />I encourage Civil War buffs to read Testament.  If you haven't read much on the Civil War then this is a good book to start with.	2003-10-07

Okay, the CIA and the FBI dropped the ball......I mean really dropped it.  The immigration people aren't doing their jobs and the ACLU is so tied up in protecting the Constitution that they're likely to kill more Americans doing it.<br />So, Why American Slept by Gerald Posner is a book worth reading.  Yes, it points out how American President after American President dropped the ball on security, and how they have miss judged not only Islamic extremists but also the so-called moderate Arab states like Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Egypt.<br />But really, none of this is generally new.  Some of the details are interesting, but didn't we already know most of this?  Certainly there is general agreement that after the 1970's the FBI and the CIA were made so ineffective by restrictions placed on them by the Congress that it made them virtually useless.  Immigration and Naturalization has become the political hot potato of recent years because of the influx of illegals.  Again, the political machinery, in the attempt to win votes at the polls has so handicapped that agency's ability to deal with the problem that they are basically ineffective.<br />America, despite the assurances of the Dept of Homeland Security isn't any more safe today than before 9/11.<br />Read Why American Slept and then read the newspapers and listen to the news.  You make up your own minds.<br />The question that needs to be asked over and over again is how can we not make this mistake again.  Historically it just seems that the United States is destined to take it on the chin time after time.  Pearl Harbor and now the Towers.	2003-10-07

After the weak Red Rabbit, Teeth of the Tiger is a welcomed relief.  Many of my friends and fellow Jack Ryan fans were perplexed when Clancy made Jack senior the President.  As we all know, acting and former Presidents don't go around stealing Russian submarines, fighting wacko IRA guys, or dealing with Colombian drug lords.  His initial answer was to turn the clock back, and that's were Red Rabbit came from.  But, as we all know, too much water had been under the bridge.  We knew too many facts about Jack.  Adding new adventures to the stack just wasn't going to work.<br />His answer....bring on a new generation.  So....Jack Ryan Jr. makes his appearance, and not just Jack.  No, no.  Two other family members...cousins join the fray this time.<br />In Teeth of the Tiger, the Hendley Associates is a front, a privately funded group of vigilantes, that takes out threats to America before those threats can come to the front.  They act when others can't or won't.  And they're recruiting new talent.<br />The new threat in Teeth of the Tiger involves a union of Islamic extremists and South American drug lords.  Their mutual hatred of the United States makes them strange bed fellows indeed.<br />Nuff said here.  Suffice it to say that Teeth of the Tiger is a suitable attempt from Clancy after the bomb of Red Rabbit.  The book is well paced, the characters believable, the plot well thought out and developed.  If you're an old Clancy fan then you'll recognize the territory.  If you're new to this genre or author then you're in for a treat...and you'll want to catch up by reading the earlier novels.	2003-09-06

Forstchen in their novel Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War, the south did it the first time.  And what an imagination those two boys have.  R. E. Lee fighting a defensive battle and General Meade fighting on the offensive.  This must be another universe I'm in.<br />There's nothing wrong with alternative history.  In fact, I loved Gettysburg the novel.  Who hasn't contemplated what might have happened if things had gone differently on July 1, 2, and 3, 1863.  Longstreet wanted to flank Meade on the morning of July 3 and avoid the fateful attack that has become known, incorrectly, as Pickett's Charge.  Longstreet urged Lee to circle around the right of the Round Tops and get between Meade's position and Washington D.C.  This would have forced Meade to go on the offensive and batter his regiments on fortified southern positions.  Well, as many of you know this didn't happen.  Pickett charged and on the afternoon of July 3 and morning of July 4, Lee and his army left the field and crossed back into friendlier territory.<br />While Gettysburg the novel is fanciful, well written, and portrays the major characters correctly, it is still just that; fanciful day dreams.  I recommend the book highly.  At the end you'll still have that bitter sweet feeling.....and you'll contemplate...What if Lee had flanked Meade.....?<br />Get the book and read it.

And what a well written book.  Benjamin Franklin: An American Life by Walter Isaacson will become the pivotal work on Mr. Franklin.  His other works, especially his work about Kissinger, are all important contributions to the hall of memorables from America's past.<br />Franklin was a man for all seasons.  Adept at business he managed to make several businesses succeed in a time when commercial success was even less common than today.  He was a scientist....his work in electicity is second to none for his contemporaries.  As a politician and statesman, Franklin is virtually without equal for his time or any other..  I think Franklin and Kissinger would have gotten along if not become fast friends.  And yes, Franklin loved the ladies....  As Isaacson suggests, Franklin's contributions to the life of this country during the early years gives him more than equal footing with the other founding fathers.  He did not make a military contribution during the war, but his was, in many ways, an even more significant gift.<br />Isaacson's book is well written and superbly researched as are all his other works.  His insight into Franklin and his time make the book worth reading for the history it covers.  If you're a history lover than you'll want to read Benjamin Franklin: An American Life. You won't find this a dry read and you'll never look at Benjamin Franklin in the same way again.	2003-08-01

Long a Kathy Reichs fan, I found that Bare Bones delivers what her faithful readers expect.....lots of gruesome details, well developed characters, and a story line that keeps the reader's interest without insulting our intelligence.  In a time of authors that don't know how to edit down their works, Kathy Reichs is a refreshing change.  She puts in front of the reader only facts that are relevant to the story....that add to the story.<br />In Bare Bones we find Temperance Brennan working hard to  identify the remains of an incinerated infant.  Before she can leave for her vacation she is called in to assist in the investigation of a plane crash near Charlotte.  Never faced with a boring or mundane existence, Tempe manages to answer all the questions and tie up all the loose ends.

On a roller coaster ride you get the big drop up front and then a twisty turning ride that eventually becomes boring.  Koontz's The Face isn't like that.  The big thrill is toward the end and then is us rather subtle.  To say the book is spiritually uplifting is an accurate  discription.<br />The characters in the book seem real.  Channing Manheim, the superstar actor who lives a pampered life punctuated by short periods of honest activity when he is making a movie.  His ten year old son Aelfric, aka \\"Fric\\", forced to live a life of indulged loneliness.  Then there is the larger than life Ethan Truman, the chief of security of the Manheim estate, who is a retired detective.  Ethan has a unique experience involving his own death, but I won't give it away and ruin your surprise.  Finally, Corky Laputa, a character that is about as evil as they come.  Corky believes in chaos and anarchy which he manages to spread throughout the novel.<br />Koontz has become the author of the subtle.  Authors grow over time (they do if we, the avid reader are lucky) and to expect their later works to mimic what they wrote early in their careers is not only idiocy, but short changes the buyer of the book.  I'd say that Koontz's later works touch on a spirituality missing in his earlier works and I for one am glad of the change.<br />If you're an old Koontz fan I would think you'd enjoy this change.  If you're new to Koontz, then get The Face and read it and make up your own mind.	2003-06-13

The invasion to free western Europe has filled perhaps more pages than any other event in history.  Beyond books, D-Day has been the subject of more movies than one can count.  Among the most famous films about D-Day was The Longest Day and a generation later Saving Private Ryan.  What else can be said about the invasion of Europe?<br />Somehow, the story of the young men from Beford, Virginia has been overlooked.  When you read the book you'll ask the same question I did....Why didn't Stephen Spielberg make his movie about WWII using this story instead of the fictional story of Private Ryan.  When you read the Bedford Boys by Alex Kershaw you'll ask the same question.<br />Bedford, Virginia is a small blue ridge mountain town of 3000.  Before WWII jobs were scarce.  Most of the men of the town joined the national guard unit to augment their meager incomes.  Most earned a dollar a day for the days they trained.  When the war started their unit became part of the 116th Infantry, one of the most battered units in Europe.  On D-Day twenty-one of Bedford's sons would die on the beaches of Normandy.  No other town of any size would suffer such a devastating loss.  Twenty-one sons, brothers, fathers, boyfriends all lost; lost as completely as anyone can be lost....erased with the sweep of an hour hand.  It boggles the mind even today nearly 60 years later.<br />Alex Kershaw does a wonderful job of bringing these young men to life.  These young soldiers aren't just characters on the stage of history.  As you learn about them, wome in more detail than the others, they become real people.  The book follows them from prewar Bedford, through training, and on the a blood stained beach in France.  The book is brutal.  The book is poetic.  You won't soon forget it.<br />The Bedford Boys is well researched.  While Kershaw's coverage of the landings is strong on details it is never the less accurate.  He uses the narratives of the few survivors to great effect.<br />If your a student of history you'll most assuredly want to read this book.  It is a landmark story.ver the less accurate.

Fast paced, strongly developing plot with a twist here and there, and characters that are at once believeable, Dirty Work is a book worth your time to read.<br />Stone Barrington is retained by Woodman & Weld to catch a wayward husband while he's seeding new pastures.  However, the person he puts on the case ends up falling on the target of the investigation, killing him.  One thing leads to another and we find that the person the husband was with in an internationally wanted intelligence agent nicknamed La Biche.  This agent has sworn an oath to kill members of a British intelligence team of which the wayward husband was a member (talk about loving your work).<br />Enough.  I don't want to ruin it for you.  If you've read any of Woods other books you know you're in for a treat.  I am relatively new to this author, but have found him to be a master storyteller.  If you're new to Stuart Woods then I predict you'll be back after you finish this one.	2003-04-24

When I discovered The Civil War: A Narrative I was even more impressed.  I thoroughly enjoyed Shelby Foote: A Writer's Life.<br />Like other reviewers, I especially liked the inclusion of Foote's fiction though more was read into it than probably should have.  However, I think Chapman does a good job in bringing the hidden and private Foote to us.  With all his foibles, Shelby Foote is destined to be remembered for generations.<br />If you're a fan of history then you need to read Shelby Foote: A Writer's Life.	2003-04-24

But can there be a character that has more in common with Job than Harry Bosch?  Doesn't he deserve a break?<br />In Lost Light Harry Bosch deals with one of the most difficult type of murder cases there is, a cold case.  Investigating a four year old murder is tough.  But our hero overcomes and in the end settles it all.  The story moves along and the characters are believable.  This is an entertaining read but lacks the \\"punch\\" of his earlier works.	2003-04-10

I have to agree with some other reviewers....New York Dead is a silky smooth read.  The plot unrolls itself without interruption from the first page to the last.  The characters, both weird and normal (is there such a thing) are entertaining to say the least.  Isn't it the search of entertainment that keeps us avid readers coming back for more???  Stuart Woods delivers.<br />Can anyone survive the fall from a twelve story building?  Well they do in New York Dead.  That's not the only surprise in the book.<br />Get the book and read it you won't regret it.	2003-04-09

I am new to Dan Brown's writing but you can rest assured that I'm going to read everything he's written to date and everything that follows.  The Da Vinci Code is a thrill a minute (thrill a page????) novel that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The story is straight forward.<br />Robert Langdon, a well known symbologist, receives a urgent and mysterious request late at night while in Paris.  It is the French authorities who ostensibly need his assistance with a murder investigation.  Taken to the museum, he quickly learns that he is a suspect.  Sophie Neveu, a giften cryptologist (and we soon learn the daughter of the murdered man) joins forces with Langdon.  Together they learn of a secret society that dates back to Christ.  Believe me, the story is out-there.<br />The story is filled with interesting characters and places.  I've mentioned this in other reviews, but this book feels like an old 1940's black and white movie.  It would be a great read on a rainy night.<br />Dan Brown also raises interesting ideas about a number of other ancient mysteries.  You'll love this book.	2003-03-27

Anthony Swoffords's memoir, Jarhead, is a no holds barred, unblemished, and unvarnished picture of what the Marine Corps is really like.  If you're looking for a made for TV or Hollywood version of the Marines or the Persian Gulf War, don't read this book.  Swofford's story is up front and accurate.  After reading Jarhead you may understand the Marines a little better.  Behind the spit shined shoes, polished brass, and crisp uniforms is an organization that is demanding and unyielding....an organization that is difficult to undertand by many insiders.  The brutality the Marines face everyday among their own is part of the experience.  And Mr. Swofford captures it perfectly.<br />Even with some of the Corps blemishes exposed, I wouldn't take anything for my experience with the Marines.  At 54 I recognize that they gave me the tools to carve out a successful life.  And I'm not the only one that would make that comment.<br />Anthony Swoffords descriptions of life in and around a battlefield is some of the best descriptive prose I've read.  The hellish descriptions of burning oil wells, tanks, personnel carriers will make you feel gritty........If you're a former Marine or a combat veteran you'll want to read this book.

This behind the scenes view of 40 years of American history is a must read by anyone over 35.  And this is the type of history book we all love to read covering the stuff that doesn't get in the paper or on the television.  Schieffer has a wonderful style of writing.

However, if you're interested is a powerful story of mental illness and denial, then buy The Moment She Was Gone and read it.  I have long been a fan of Evan Hunter.  The Moment She Was Gone is a fitting departure from his normal work.  I applaud him for having the courage of a different vision.<br />I was easily able to identify with most of the characters in this novel.  That is a testament of Mr. Hunters ability to tell a story and develope characters that are interesting and believable.  Buy this book and read it.  A great weekend read.	2003-03-10

H H Holmes could certainly teach us a few twists on stalking, killing and disposing of the victims of a wanton murderer.<br />This is a wonderful book with generally alternating chapters on Holmse, a deranged killer and Daniel Hudson Burnham, an architect and general magician who managed to pull together the<br />White City on a mere two year schedule.  Burnham also brought the talents of other well know civil designers such as Frederick Law Olmsted, Charles McKim and Louis Sullivan.<br />Burnham and Holmes were personable, good looking men, and each were among the best at what they did.  Holmes managed to kill close to 200 people, mostly women, and dispose of their bodies right under the noses of authorities.  Burnham became even more famous after building the Flatiron Building.<br />This is also a good examination of life at the turn of the last century and how Americans love a big show.<br />A wonderful book that will take you no time to page through.	2003-03-07

Written in a manner that is engaging and just a little poetic, The Blind Man of Seville is filled with wonderful characters in a great setting.<br />Detective Javier Falcon, Chief Inspector of the Seville Homicide Department is called to investigate the murder of a well known restaurateur Raul Jiminez.  Falcon not only struggles with the brutality of the murder, but also the meticulous manner in which the killer planned and stalked his prey.  Falcon very quickly discovers that he is dealing with a brilliant psychopath.  Ultimately, his investigation begins to touch his own past.  In some ways, and with obvious differences, The Blind Man of Seville reminds me of Jeffery Deaver's The Bone Collector because of the way the killer plays with the police.  However, the treatment of children in this story is disturbing....nuf said.<br />If there is a weakness to this book, and it is a small one, it would be the referrals to the long lost journal kept by Falcon's father.  The constant break in the ebb and flow of the first story is distracting.<br />I am looking forward to the release of Instruments of Darkness, Wilson's next scheduled book for U. S. readers.<br />This is a worthy book and deserving of your attention.	2003-02-26

I hated math as a child and didn't learn to love and respect math until I became an adult and had to take math related courses for my graduate classes.  Had I read this book as a 12 year old I'd have embraced the concept of numbers and mathematics much earlier.  Hans Magnus (what a wonderful middle name) Enzensberger is a genious.  Introducing simple and complex concepts by the dozens, he takes the reader through the process of examining these concepts and makes understanding them easy.  No memorization here.  Robert, the main character dreams his way through Goldbach's conjecture, harmonic series, irrational numbers, natural numbers and much, much more.<br />If you're the parent of a child, boy or girl, who is struggling in math classes, give them this book.

Told only as an insider can do, For Spacious Skies is a worthy addition to the books written by the other original astronauts.<br />Scott Carpenter and his daughter Kris Stoever do a masterful job of pulling together a story much larger than the book that tells the story.  From Scott's early days growing up in a home situation not considered normal for the time, to his early days in the Navy and then his application and acceptance into the astronaut program, the book is filled with insights and eye opening stories.<br />Balanced in the picture it paints of NASA and the other astronauts, this is a must read.  It is certain to take its place with the other books about this era and stand as an equal to them.	2003-02-13

Could the Chinese have discovered virtually every continent decades or centuries before the europeans?  Are early Chinese explorers the compilers of so many early maps; maps that aided the european explorers that followed them?  The list of questions goes on and on.  According to Mr. Menzies in 1421: The Year China Discovered America, the Chinese did all of this and much, much more.  But Carl Sagan once said that extraordinary claims call for extraordinary proof.  And that's the problem with this book.  The proof in most cases isn't scientific but rather based on hunches.<br />1421: The Year China Discovered America certainly isn't short on research.  Menzies takes his time spinning his theory, a dab of evidence here and a dab of evidence there.  But in the end the whole idea is based on a house of cards.  One nagging thought I kept having while I was reading this is why the Chinese didn't sail up the Thames?  They went everywhere else/<br />One thing is apparently clear from reading this book.  The history we've been taught in school and have come to believe as true can't be complete.  While I don't accept all that Menzies has to sell, I do believe that he is correct in that the Chinese had more contact with civilizations around the world than we have thought true.  Is everything he says true.  Hardly.  But I believe he has hit upon some tantalizing ideas.  Better research from better sources in the future may make what is dim and blurry as clear as truth.	2003-02-13

Blanton and Cook's book about women soldiers serving in both the Northern and Southern Armies is entertaining.  But be forwarned, it does have a halting style of writing.  It drags in places and flies in others.<br />Well researched, the book does advance the topic of women serving as men during the civil war. And it does cover a few battles.  However, if you're looking for light reading or looking for a general book on the civil war, then you need to keep looking.<br />As I worked my way through the book I did keep pondering the question of sister fighting sister, or mother fighting mother.  We certainly make much of the brother against brother of son against father aspects of this conflict.  I wonder how many woment really did fight during the civil war in both armies?  I don't know that we'll ever know that answer, but not because Blanton and Cook didn't try to find out.	2003-02-04

That it would show Islam to be a violent and unreasonable faith.  However, after reading the book, I realize that wasn't the case.  Robert Spencer does an admirable job picking his way between the faith as it should be, as it was perhaps intended to be, and how it has been hijacked by various political movements today that have nothing be selfish ends in mind.  Spencer looks at the faith in a number of areas, for example \\"Does Islam Respect Human Rights?\\", \\"Does Islam Respect Women?\\", \\"Can Science and Culture Flourish under Islam?\\" to name just three of the chapters in the book.  He fairly exposes the truths and untruths behind the faith.<br />For those of us that aren't familiar with the details of Islam, this is a must read.	2003-01-17

When I first picked up this book the thought that gripped me was &quot;what on earth could be new that deserved to be in another book about the Lusitania?&quot;  Well, I'm glad I kept the book and read it through.  Lusitania: An Epic Tragedy is certainly worth the time it takes to get through it.  There are new facts here.  I found the Epilogue to be particularly interesting and the information on what happened to the U20 filled in the story....gave closure this event.<br />Diana Preston weaves the details of this tragedy around the reader like a spider weaving a web.  Before you know it, you're standing on the deck of the Lusitania watching the torpedo speed its way to you.  Absolutely gripping.  Ms Preston also reminds me of another historian that was popular to read; Barbara Tuckman.  Preston pays attention to details but doesn't overwhelm the reader with too much information.  I can't wait to get my hands of some of her previous works.  If you like history, especially maritime history, you'll love this book.	2003-01-15

Some of the scenes in the story could be right off the headlines of todays newspapers.  The characters are fresh and for the most part believable and the pace of the story is breathtaking, at least through the first half of the book.  I do have problems with the premise that only an Israeli/Arab coalition against Iraq can save the United States.  Has our military dry rotted to the point that our survival rests on two factions that are bitter enemies?  The author has spent so much time making this book work, making it seem real that such a faulty assumption seems laughable.  However, it is a worthwhile read but it doesn't live up to Limbaugh's review.	2003-01-14

Well written and well researched, Pox: Genius, Madness, and the Mysteries of Syphilis is a great study in how disease can alter one's perspective about the environment and how one interacts with those around them.  Deborah Hayden spares no one from her magnifying glass.  Abraham and Mary Lincoln, Adolf Hitler, James Joyce, Karen Blixen (Of Out of Africa fame), Beethoven are just a few of those investigated.  Hayden also does a good job in looking at the connection between creativity, madness and the disease.

When I picked up Hornet Flight I knew I was going to be told a story that I would not forget.  Well, Hornet Flight is good, I mean good....but it is not up to Eye of the Needle.<br />The story revolves around Harald Olufsen an eighteen year old Dane and information he holds regarding a secret German installation that allows the Nazis to shoot down at will the British long-range bombers before they can reach their objectives.  The story is fast paced and full of very believable characters.  One of the things I like about Follett's stories is that if you're a villain, then you are completely nasty.  No grays here.<br />You'll enjoy the book even though it is contrived and predictable in places.  You can forgive this because there are twists and turns that keep you from becoming too bored.  If you've liked other Follett novels you're probably going to enjoy this one.	2003-01-08

By the Light of the Moon is typical Dean Koontz, a page turner that will keep your finger wet.  Like other Koontz stories, this one is full of drama, suspense, and a thrill a second.  It incorporates an extensive chase that lasts most of the book which is similar to One Door Away From Heaven.  And like One Door Away From Heaven, By the Light of the Moon is full of inspiration, believable characters and wonderful locations.<br />The novel begins with young artist Dylan O'Conner, his autistic brother Shep both being attacked by a demented scientist at a motel and injected with a mysterious substance.  Also attacked and injected is Jillian Jackson, an attractive young comedian.  They are warned to take off immediately because, the doctor informs them, he is being hunted down by people who want him and his discovery killed.  And the chase is on.<br />If the book has a problem it is the ending.  But, as others have pointed out, this may set up a sequel to this story.  That would make most Koontz readers very happy.  You'll want a full pot of coffee and lots of munchies for this book.	2002-12-31

On the one hand the material dealing with Cook and his various voyages was captivating.  The material was well researched and full of original insights to both Cook the Captain and Cook the man.  Horwitz's coverage was balanced and thorough.  However, the material dealing with the authors travels was one of the most sophomoric displays of writing I've seen in a long time.  Whether drinking and getting drunk with the Australians at a Cook reactment, or smoking pot with native teenagers, the whole coverage left me wanting.  Where is the mature and detached observer?  He certainly isn't present in the pages of this book.<br />If you're interested in Cook then this book is a worthwhile read.  Unfortunately you'll have to put up with the other stuff as well.  There are other well written sources dealing with Cook and his explorations.  This one is generally disappointing.	2002-12-17

I haven't been a steady reader but have enjoyed the books that I have read. When I read The Sea Hunters (the first one) I was impressed in the diversity that Cussler showed. Not all fiction authors are comfortable in the nonfiction arena. But Cussler was or is.<br />This second outing of Sea Hunters is as good as the first. If you liked the first one than you'll probably enjoy the second. For me, two stories stand out more than the others. L'Oisear Blanc (The White Bird) concerns the Paris to New York attempt of Nungesser and Coli in 1927. While there were many attempts to capture the $25,000 prize for being the first to make this trip, it was Nungesser and Coli that preceded Lindberg by mere days. Of course, Lindberg made it and Nungesser and Coli have never been heard of after they apparently failed in their attempt. Working on slim clues, Cussler made several attempts to find their downed aircraft in the back woods and lakes of Maine. The other story that impresses me is R. M. S. Carpathia. It was the Carpathia that raced to the aid of Titanic survivors in 1912 only to be lost to a German U Boat a few years later.<br />Cussler manages to write in a relaxed manner. His tales are spellbinding. I'm sure that in the years to come he may be remembered with the other great adverturers of the 20th Century. This is a good read.	2002-12-09

I replace this book with a new one just last year.<br />The old favorites are all here; Fireflies in the Garden, The Road Not Taken, Fire and Ice, Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening, and a hundred more.  In my opinion this is the definitive volume on Frost.<br />I have always been awed by the number of poems Frost wrote about the stars.  A Star on a Stoneboat, The Star Spitter, Stars, Canis Major and many others.  Truly Robert Frost is the astronomers poet.<br />Also in this volume is perhaps my favorite Frost poem, Brown's Descent.<br />If you love reading Frost on a crispy fall evening, then you'll love reading him when the crickets chirp.

But they don't tell the same story.  The story changes in new hues and tints as each character puts a new and different interpretation on the tale.  Each character in turn advances the story as well.  What a great way to tell a story.<br />And by the way, the ending is fitting and makes you want to pick up another Rash story....but there arent any.......YET.	2002-12-06

You may ask yourself why the world needs another book about WWII as I did before I read this book.  However, as I read my way through the book, I realized that I was becoming privy to information about FDR, Truman, Churchill, and Stalin that I had never seen before.<br />The book isn't kind to our leaders either.  It confirms that Roosevelt did in fact drag his feet about acting on the murders of the Jewish population in Europe.  New to my knowledge is the deep feelings Morgenthau harbored toward Roosevelt.<br />Well written and balanced in scope this is a must read to anyone interested in the major events of the second world war.	2002-11-27

From 57 visa types (more than 50 ways to leave your lover), to the lack of concern by those who set policy about immigration, this book makes the government look bad.  And it should.<br />I think Malkin's approach to the subject of immigration is balanced.  She does an excellent job in laying out what is wrong with the system.  One example, pg 141:<br />In &quot;Novemeber of 2001, Attorney General John Ashcroft dangled the promise of citizenship before any foreigners, including criminal illegal aliens, who come forward with information that would aid the investigation of the September 11 attacks.&quot;  The information only has to be &quot;useful and relevant&quot;.  It doesn't even need to lead to an arrest.  What garbage.  What's the old saying, lie down with pigs and you'll get dirty?????<br />Well written, this book is a nonfiction page turner.

Always impressive as he wanders the streets of major cities (and at least on trip to the backwater south american jungles) performing his magic for all who care to observe, Blaine impresses here as well.  In his first book, the first of many no doubt, he is good....really good.<br />The book is part history of magic...yes.  But the most impressive information in the book is about Blaine himself - and his magic.  The book is easy to read because it flows smoothly from one topic to the other.

Certainly many books poke at this timeless theme, and Hollywood certainly isn't unfamiliar with the same theme. John Schaiffer and his father Frank do justice to this idea without becoming trite or syrupy.<br />The book examines what it mean to become a Marine. But it also directly and indirectly digs into the idea of commitment to a higher idea...in this case giving up oneself to become a member of an elite group of fighting men, and in the process getting back more than one gave up. It flip flops between John's narrative and his fathers observations. Interesting.<br />As a former Marine I found a connection with John. Having gone through bootcamp in June of 1967 in San Diego, the connection to this new generation of Marines is immediate and profound. This, as all former Marines know, isn't new. The membership in this club spans all generations. No generation gap here.<br />If you're a former Marine, you'll want to read the book for obvious reasons. If you're not, read it anyway. You'll gain some respect for the youth of today.	2002-11-25

The Christmas Train, however, is a major departure for Baldacci.  This is not a mystery, and there is no villain to nab....just good warm hearted storytelling about a train journey.  The book has a lot going for it, love, confused passion, and the inevitable romance trains seem to exude in novels from decades back.  If you're a lover of trains you'll want to experience this story.  If you're a sucker for heart warming christmas story, you'll also want to read this book.

Any topic he chose to write on was thoroughly researched and the story crafted in a way other authors of the genre were hard pressed to match.  I didn't always agree with what I read, but I new the work came from a consumate teacher and researcher.<br />To America: Personal Reflections on an Historian is a wonderful book to read if for no other reason than the varied topics he covers.  Everything from Custer, Crazy Horse and the Little Big Horn to the Transcontinental Railroad; from Eisenhower to Nixon.  But this book also displays the same endearing qualities as Ambrose's other works.  His attention to detail and his ability to tell the story that is interesting are present.  If you haven't read any of his other books you will after reading To America.  If you're an old fan, you may want to dig out your old copies and have a go at them again.	2002-11-12

If you're looking for the thrills and spills of his earlier years, keep on looking.  This story is intelligent.  It builds slowly, letting the characters develop naturally and at their own pace.<br />A supernatural car shows up in Pennsylvania at an out of the way gas-n-go.  The driver disappears and the state patrol is called.  The car is eventually towed to the main barracks of PSP Troop D where it is stored for the next 30 years.  Gradually the story unfolds not only about the car but about the troopers that stand guard over the car.  The troopers investigate the car, record with video the \\"lightquakes\\" and generally marvel at the variety of creatures the car produces; apparently pulling them from another universe.  Better stop there.  Don't want to give too much away.<br />The story also deals with loyalty and commitment among the troopers that come in and go out of the story.<br />Other reviewers have said this before me; this is the work of a mature author, comfortable with his craft and his ability to construct a story.<br />If you've read other King books and enjoyed them you'll probably enjoy this one.  If you're looking for the electricity of \\"It\\", \\"The Shining\\", or \\"The Stand\\" keep looking.  This book is similar emotionally to \\"Hearts of Atlantis\\".	2002-10-30

The array of characters he includes in Seeing is astounding, and certainly there are far too many to include here.  Suffice it to say that astronomy, as a hobby, is healthy and in good hands with people who stay under the starry dome by choice and often make significant contributions to the body of knowledge inspite of the snobbery of a few professionals.  You will be refreshed after reading their stories.<br />Of particular interest is Ferris' coverage of galaxy clusters and super clusters toward the end of the book.

However, when compared to some of his earlier work, Noble Norfleet is a bit of a disappointment. (Still good mind you, but not up to his normal level).  I found the premise of the book to be intriguing.  Certainly being left alive when both your siblings are killed by your mother is enough to send most 17 year old boys into permanent la la land.<br />The basis of the story is sound.  We are given peeks of Noble's life through his Army days, and then his career as a male nurse.  As time goes on in the book, however, the attention to the story becomes thinner and thinner.  Eventually, the story becomes so thin that it is trasparent at the end.  While the book covers over 30 years, the greatest amount of detail is given to the first few months of the book and little attention to detail at the end.<br />The sex in the book isn't gratuitous and not necessarily over done, but important to the story line.<br />I recommend this book highly.	2002-08-14

I have said in an earlier review that there can not be a finer descriptive author currently writing.  When Burke writes about the swamp you can feel the humidity and smell the water and hear the crickets.  When he writes about a summer thunder storm you can smell the wet on the pavement and feel the vapor rising into the air.<br />I must add to this Burke's ability to creat believeable characters filled with all the human faults and gifts we see in people around us.  Gritty is descriptive but falls short of what I want to convey.<br />Jolie Blon's Bounce involves two murders.  One of a innocent teenage girl and the other of a prostitute who is related to the mob.  The main suspect is Tee Bobby Hulin, a gifted musician who, despite hit gift, seems to be on the road to self imposed ruin.  But Dave is not convinced of Hulin's guilt and Burke provides us with an array of possible bad guys.  One, perhaps the most evil character yet devised by Burke, is Legion, a former overseer of a large farm and molester of black women, who bests Dave in a physical confrontation and then demeans him in a way that will surprise you.  You won't believe this guy.<br />Speaking of surprises, the outcome surprised me.<br />If you've liked other Burke books then you'll like this one.	2002-08-14

Almost 13 years later, I was excited when the announcement was made.  At last, the adventures of Ayla and Jondalar would continue.  Whinny, Racer and Wolf would be off with their human companions exploring and discovering yet more good \\"stuff\\".  As I read through Shelters of Stone it became obvious to me that this book is much different than those that come before it.  First the story stalls a bit because Jondalar and Ayla finally arrive home.  There's no reason for them to camp out....experiencing tests and trials galore.  They're home...safe among those that do love them and will love them.  Second, a huge number of new characters had to be developmented...infact an intirely new civilization of separate caves had to be created.<br />To the casual reader I guess these changes do cause the story to bog down.  But there is still enough here to justify reading the book.  Watching the adoption of new technologies by this group of people is interesting in itself as is the idea of people keeping and working with animals.  I thought the idea of the Zelandoni (the healers) holding the fire starting technology to themselves to inhance their prestige and power an amazingly human touch provided by Auel.  Of course they couldn't and didn't but it makes them the type of humans we can identify with.<br />Auel develops new lore and traditions of the Zelandonii people from the very beginning of the first chapter.  This is no easy task under any circumstances.<br />I believe that those that read this book will not regret it when they've finished.  I also believe that time and reflection may make those that do not like this book presently change their opinions.<br />If you don't want to buy the book check it out from your public library...In either case you'll enjoy the read.	2002-06-18

Everything's Eventual simply confirms this fact. Writing short stories is very different than writing a novel, or at least that's what I've been told. Story and character development have to occur pretty quickly and any twists in the plot have to happen in a very condensed manner. Stephen King has the ability to quickly involve the reader in a short story. His pacing in shorts is great. Almost never a dull moment.<br />Then there are the types of stories he writes. In Everything's Eventual the 14 stories he gives us run the range of his talents. Ghost stories, stories filled with irony, ordinary people run amok, and twists of fate are all represented in this volume. Plus in The Little Sisters of Eluria, we see Roland in a continuation of the Gunslinger saga. Several of the stories, Riding the Bullet, 1408, Lunch at Gotham Cafe, LT's Theory of Pets and In the Deathroom have appeared previously in one form or another, but I enjoyed reading them anyway.<br />If it is true that Stephen King will write only 5 more books and this is one of them, then Everything's Eventual is a fitting beginning to the ending of one of the greatest American authors to come down the pike. If he isn't recognized for that now, it will happen \\"eventually.\\"	2002-04-18

I enjoyed that book tremendously. I wasn't disappointed in this collection of short stories.<br />Andrea Barrett has a great ability when it comes to developing characters. From Max Vigne, a hard working member of a mapping expedition in the area of Northern India in the title story, Servant of the Map\\" to his wife Clara that makes a major appearance in the final story \\"The Cure\\", all her characters are real. Almost real enough, it seems, to reach out and touch.<br />Each story stands on its own. But the way Ms Barrett weaves the stories together if fabulous. The final story, by the way, is connected to her book, Voyage of the Narwhal. Ned Kynd, an inn keeper in the \\"The Cure\\" played a major role in the novel.<br />I think readers appreciate these connections with past reads. It shows that the author respects the intelligence of the reader and isn't afraid to say that perhaps that story wasn't quite finished.<br />Finally, Barrett is a wonderful story teller. One can read along in any of these stories and almost take for granted what one is reading. Then all of a sudden a major twist in the story, or some new development with the character, or a connection with something you've read before.<br />Read this book.	2002-03-31

I couldn't claim to have read everything of worth on this pivitol, but I have read many.  This one is the best.<br />Almost minute by minute coverage of the battle with detailed troop movements, the reader is transported back to July 1, 1863.  Fair treatment is given to both Confederate and Union participants, not always common among some modern authors.  Major characters are developed with enough detail to make them interesting, but not so much that the book threatens to become a biography of actors and not a story about the battle itself.  I especially like the inclusion of residents of Gettysburg into the coverage.  This group is too often ignored.<br />I think anyone with even a mild interest in this battle would agree that reading this book is not a waste of time.  I can't wait to read Gettysburg the Second Day originally published in 1987 but missed by me.	2002-03-12

At a time in many author's career when they start running dry of ideas, Leonard seems to be picking up speed.  Tishomingo Blues is a snappy story.  The characters, both Dennis Lenahan the high diver and Robert Taylor, the wise cracking, street smart guy from Detroit make the novel believable.<br />Dennis sees a murder as he prepares his rig for a show.  Convinced that he may have been seen....well that gets too close to the good stuff.<br />Civil War reenactments with maybe live amo just adds to the fun, but I give too much away.

The Universe In a Nutshell surpasses them all.  Hawkings manages to tell his &quot;story&quot; in a way that allows the reader to understand exactly what he means.  Using scientific terms only when necessary, Hawkings leads the reader through topics reflecting current physics research today.  The illustrations are top notch and support the text well.  If you have only one book of science in your home today, this will be the one you'll want.  If you own a Brief History of Time already then you'll want this one also.  Speaking of a Brief History of Time; the concepts it contains are difficult to grasp sometimes.  But spend some &quot;time&quot; reading and pondering the information he provides.  You won't be disappointed.<br />Hawkings should be voted educator of the year for what he has managed to do in The Universe in a Nutshell.	2002-01-23

One Door Away from Heaven continues the Koontz tradition of a tight story wound around well developed characters.  This newest endeavor keeps the reader coming back for more each time the scene changes in the story.  Koontz more than other authors in this genre manages to tease the reader with a cliff hanger set up at the end of most chapters.  The entire novel switches back and forth between 2 or three sets of characters.  One treat for me is that I can never quite figure out how he will weave it altogether.  I'm always satisfied when the story finally ends though.  I think the ET story line works well here.  The author spent some time to make it viable.<br />At more than 600 pages this book does take some commitment.  However, after you've completed it you won't miss the extra time it took to get through.  Remember, it ain't the length that counts.  If you don't want to buy this book then check it out from your public library.  Either way, you won't be disappointed.	2002-01-14

Hess has written a masterful text on a topic not missed by many civil war authors.  His treatment is almost minute by minute beginning with the artillery battle preceding the actual charge.  Hess deals with the major players on both the confederate and union sides.  I feel he is particularly accurate in his discussion about the lack of leadership exhibited by General Longstreet.  While Longstreet objected to the attack, he did little to dissuade his commander.  Once the attack was underway, Longstreet did little to lead as best he could.  Instead he sat on a fence.<br />Hess is also on target when he discusses the role of North Carolina and Virginian troops taking part in the attack.  The Tar Heels have been maligned long enough for the actions of others.<br />I really like the tender way in which Hess deals with the problems of the troops that made the attack.  It is not widely known that some confederate soldiers may have faked heat exhaustion to avoid what they new to be a suicide attack.  While Hess points this out, he avoids making judgements from the safety of nearly 140 years of separation in time.<br />I highly recommend this book for those who have not read extensively about the battle and this charge in particular.  Those that have read much on Gettysburg will appreciate the fresh approach of this author.	2002-01-02

Hess has written one of the best researched accounts of Pickett's charge ever written.  Working from primary sources with some secondary sources thrown in, Hess takes the reader through a step by step account of what happened on July 3, 1863. The author provides the reader with everything they need to  understand the place this event holds in the battle of Gettysburg specifically, but also in the course of the war generally.  The major actors; Lee, Longstreet, Pickett, Pettigrew and others are revealed in detail.  Hess also introduces voices often overlooked.  In this case the foot soldier who made history.  Enlisted and commissioned remembrances are used and  both confederate and union participants are included. Due homeage is paid to the bravery of the confederates.  However the author also reveals the courage of the union forces that repulsed the attack.<BR>For civil war buffs this is a must read.	2001-12-27

I became of a fan immediately.  His story line is as multilayered as his characters.  In This Rock, one brother, Muir, struggles to find himself.  He seems to be heading for a life lived in the word and serving his God.  The other brother, Moody, seems to do nothing more than a little bootlegging.  Moody wants to lose himself.  He suffers from some deep hurt we are never privy to.  Robert Morgan takes these two characters and wraps a novel around them.  Two brothers as different as hot and cold, living a basic life filled with the struggle to survive and yet their lives seem to be so much richer that ours.<br />Other characters, Hank and Julia from Gap Creek make an appearance.  It was nice to see their progress.  Ginny, Muir and Moody's mother is a strong woman left to get by on her own after her husband dies.<br />I won't give anymore away.  The book is an interesting read.  It appeals to the intellect and the heart.  If you're looking for a techno thriller you better keep looking.  This Rock isn't for you.  If you're looking to be touched emotionally and spiritually, then you won't be disappointed.	2001-11-26

I'm not sure that the mystery has really been solved.  Not yet anyway.<br />Roanoke: Soving the Mystery of the Lost Colony by Lee Miller is one more attempt to intellectually solve a mystery that can never really be solved.  Were the colonist murdered by local natives?  Did they intermarry with a friendly tribe?  We are still left with no firm answers.  Miller's theory that she seems most committed to is that a few of the colonists were sold off into slavery to other interior tribes (or were captured from their friendly hosts when they were in turn defeated by interior tribes).  These colonists worked the copper mines in and around modern Randolph County.<br />Well, Miller spins an interesting yarn.  I must admit that I was hooked almost immediately.  Still, after reading the book, I'm not sure we know anymore about the ill fated group.  And I'm not sure we ever will.	2001-11-26

I have been a fan of both since that time.  Reading Black House was like a stroll down memory lane.  Old characters brought back (at least mentioned in some cases) was like visiting old friends that you haven't heard from in a while.<br />I thought the tie in with the Gunslinger seriers (Dark Tower) was a brainstorm.  That Straub bought into the premise is a wonder.<br />Jack, now middleaged, is called from retirement to help solve brutal murders of children.  Gradually he is drawn into crimes so gruesome that they stretch credibility.  Of course, after the twin towers were laid low, can anything be doubted.<br />New characters, Henry, Beezer (an educated and lovable brute) Sophie, and others.<br />As expected, the territories play a major role in this new story, but not to the extent as in the Talisman.  This is typical King/Struab...tight story, believable characters, suspensful storytelling.  Don't listen to the nay sayers.

It is no surprise that he eventually broke the code that allowed the reading of ancient hieroglyphs. More important than his knack for languages was the tenacity he displayed. He often became discouraged buy never gave up.<br />Further, Champollian is a good example how the truly virtuous and truly brilliant are often overlooked by those less gifted then they. Jean was ignored by the academic community for years because of his lack of &quot;political correctness&quot;. How this plays today? Personal jealousies both in and out of France could have destroyed someone of lesser fortitude.<br />All of these are subplots to the wider, more popular story which Lesley and Roy Adkins do such a good job of telling. While the story in general is captivating, it is the subplots that linger.<br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in history well told.	2001-08-30
US	52872630	R3079NTA2MD0ZL	0684813637	747139631	John Adams	Books	5	7	8	N	N	John Adams, a whale of a life	David McCullough presents both the life of John Adams and the era he grew from with a clarity that leaves other biographies cold. If I had to describe this book to a friend I would say it was a &quot;page turner&quot;. I couldn't put it down for long before I found my self sneaking off to read some more.<br />McCullough tells us the things that made John Adams unique. A family man, a country lawyer, a commited farmer, a man devoted to his children....all these factors reveal a man special for his time. Even more important is the fact that as the story of Adams is developed so is the history that molded him and that was molded by him. We are also provided valuable insights to Jefferson, Washington, Hamilton, and the early American press.<br />Anyone who reads this book will have to become a better American because of it.	2001-08-30

Jay Winik has written a book that is a page turner, at least for me.  His treatment of Lee, Grant, Lincoln, and the hundreds of other players during this episode of American history in nothing short of wonderous.<br />Also, Winik's treatment of the irony sprinkled throughout the events of this month in history is great also.  A clerks error and the confederate army starves.  Starving armies don't remain in the field for very long.  One can't help but wonder how different American history would have been had this minor mistake not taken place. (What happened to the food anyway?)<br />Lincoln's revelation of the dream in which he is dead is chilling to say the least.<br />I could recommend this book to anyone including Lee, Grant, and Lincoln.	2001-07-13

I took Warlock everywhere I went, including my daughters wedding to be sure that when I had a free minute I could slide off somewhere quiet and read.  I found Warlock to be a suspenseful and intriguing read.  While I am still somewhat new to Wilbur Smith (I've read Birds of Prey, Monsoon and River God) I feel like I've just watched a Errol Flynn movie when I've finished with his books. All of the books I have read are full of high adventure.  Warlock is the best one yet.<br />The young Nefer orphaned by the underhanded assassin Naha. The old Warlock's work is cut out for him.  The book is comprised of one adventure after the other until the new king is victorious and settled in his throne with his young queen.<br />Great characters.  Plot is wonderful and finely spun like a spider web.  Scenes are so well described that you can taste the Nile or feel the heat of the desert.<br />I'll read it again.	2001-06-12

As anyone knows who has done research involving combat actions, memories, even very shortly after a battle can become blurred.  Babits I think does a good job sifting through some of the bogus recollections that comes from this &quot;fog&quot; of battle. The battle reconstruction, unit movements, and analysis of casulties is the best I have read regarding this action.  Anyone reading this book should do so carefully.  Footnotes should be consulted and time should be spent with the variety of charts and maps. The book is a little slow, but then most books of this nature are read by people looking for knowledge and not a good time.	2001-05-03

I honestly believe this is his best book ever, though some of my library patrons disagree.  However, I was kept on the edge of my seat (and bed) through the entire novel. I thought the characters, everyone of them, were believable.  The story moved and kept moving.  Many good, and really good books seem to simply die in places.  I know some of Stephen Kings works are like that.  I guess it comes from having to spend time setting up a twist in the plot, or in developing character background or backstory.  Still, most novels have soft places in them.  From the Corner of His Eye isn't one of those.  I honestly think this is one of the best modern novels I've read in a while.	2001-04-23
US	52872630	R1LV3EORFKDJQX	0060193387	930499365	A History of the Wife	Books	4	39	40	N	N	History of the Wife reviewed by a Husband	Marilyn Yalom is a compassionate author filled with passion.  History of the Wife grabs the reader and moves them from a discussion of wives of Greece to the modern, liberated, opinionated, and hard working version today.  Along the way the reader is rewarded with diary accounts that supports the general premise that women have been historically treated as second, third and fourth class citizens. She points out, perhaps accidently, that each age has seen the advancement of wives from persons of no rights to individuals fully functional in todays world.  The book deals with European wives as well as wives on the North American continent.  Also included in this latter group are slave wives and native american wives.<br />All together this is the kind of history book that Barbara Tuckman or Fernand Braudel would have enjoyed writing and reading.  Filled with insights galore.  I loved it.	2001-03-20
