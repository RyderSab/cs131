Unless one found How to Make Pizza used, I would encourage you to consider The Best Recipe instead.<br />The Cooks Illustrated series is unsurpassed for methodologies and the depth of why certain things work and not.  From this, one builds a foundation of cooking which can be infinitely extended.  Think of these books as the Consumer Reports of cooking, or as they like to say, &quot;We baked 37 different pizza crusts so you don't have to.&quot;	2004-01-24

They first suggest some basics for your kitchen, aiming to be practical and spending only where it truly makes a difference.<br />Next, is a foundation of beef, chicken, vegetable and seafood stock recipes.  I enjoy reading these because they're very methodical in trying to understand how to best do things, often suggesting short cuts where &quot;20% of the effort results in 90% of the flavor.&quot;  There's clearly substantial trial and error, but nice summary of what worked and didn't.<br />I was especially delighted to see they covered a variety of international cuisines, including Thai and Indian curries (from scratch!), borscht, miso, boullabaisse, minestrone, and gazpacho.<br />This is easily a &quot;must have&quot; for the creative cook.	2004-01-24

Polly Platt provides countless examples of Americans who just couldn't grok the French, suggests how the French perceive the world and recommends ways of approaching the situation better.  She covers the gamut of common situations from business meetings (e.g., the importance of shaking hands), the systeme'D, and the delicate etiquette expected during the highly coveted dinner (assume you won't see a toilet during the evening, never ask the host for the recipe, and keep quiet).  THere's a wealth of French history filling out some of the more curious angles, as well as copious emphasis on core values such as education in mathematics and science.  After reading this I began to understand them more and appreciated their uniqueness.	2003-08-20

It's a fairly quick read with more depth than \\"The Princess Test,\\" but not as much main character development as \\"Cinderellis and the Glass Hill.\\"<br />Robin is considered an imbecile in his family because he likes to tell jokes instead of making up words (like his two elder brothers Nat and Matt) or create poems (like his father Jake).  He wants to be accepted -- a common theme in these stories -- but his relatives won't.<br />Robin stumbles upon Lark, the also-bird-named princess to the kingdom of Biddle.  They hit it off because they treat each other as normal people.  Unfortunately, Robin's a commoner, and the two are discouraged from meeting again, though we know they're destined to.<br />Robin has more of a personality than some of the other princes-to-be of the other Gail Carson Levine stories, and it's interesting to glimpse into his struggle.  He likes her, he's not sure she likes him, he gets discouraged, starts to have hope, etc.<br />The subplots are not as enchanting as the other stories.  King Humphrey has a speech impediment that causes  him to harrumph every word.  There is one scene where this is pretty funny because he's describing what he wants done while his scribe is attempting to translate it to English (Biddlish?).  It's a bit much to read aloud, however.<br />On the other hand, the quests Robin must fulfill are absurdly funny, and listening to him work out how to build a ship that works as well on land as it does the sea is amusing.	2003-07-13

Also highly useful is some explanation on why certain regulations are in place.

One of the things I like the most is the princess is a rich character and very three dimensional.  As is expected, she'll fall in love with someone eventually, but -- surprise -- we get to see her develop as a real, ordinary person first.  This is a contrast from many of the books in the Gail Levine \\"Princess Tales\\" series.<br />The language is fairly rich, also a pleasant treat, but the chapters are a bit too long for reading aloud as a bedtime story.	2003-07-03

As in the other books in the Princess series, Levine does a great job of portraying unsavory characters as capable of some redemption.  For example, in Biddle, Randolph and Rudolph, while the bane of Tansy's daily life, eventually become comfortable with their place in the universe and co-exist with their brother.	2003-04-27

It initially looks very good, but we've found it somewhat difficult to use.<br />The photographs of the prepared meals are excellent and probably the book's strongest suit.  While browsing, you'll forget that you're eating healthy.<br />Layout is like most cookbooks: soups, snacks, pies, pastas, salads, side-vegetables, sauces and desserts.  What would be really helpful is a meal planner, or something suggesting sides that would complement entrees.<br />Each recipe has a rating, one to three stars, relating to its complexity.  The breadth of complexity is pretty wide.  For example, baby baked potatos and vegetable pot pies are both \\"one star,\\" despite the latter taking many more steps and ingredients.  Pumpkin and herb ravioli would be a two-star (medium difficulty) while roasted vegetable lasagne is a three-star (the hardest).<br />There's no correlation between the complexity and the time to prepare & cook.  For example, the pot pies, ravioli and lasagne recipes (above) all take about two and a half hours from start to serve.<br />Thus, it's practical only for the weekend chef.<br />Finally, the mix of metric and imperial units is distracting.  For example, one recipe might read:<br />  500g (1 lb) fettucini<br />  2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley<br />  while another might read:<br />  60g (2 oz) butter<br />  1 cup (250ml/8 fl oz) olive oil<br />On a couple of occasions I've misread the change in units.  I would be much easier if they stuck with one system.<br />There are some redeeming features, but you can do much better with other books.	2002-11-17

(And reread)<br />Humor exists at many levels.  The concept of a balloon farm is so absurd to an adult, yet inherently logical to children: for balloons must come from *somewhere*.<br />The only character in the story who's really concerned about the paradox calls in the government.  He is chagrined when the agents certify the balloon farm as genuine,  and leaves in a huff, never to be seen again.<br />The vernacular adds to the depth of charm - a real person is telling us this story.  The illustrations are outstanding, adding to the magic.	2002-11-06

It's an easy read to a toddler, with several pictures throughout, and journey maps on the inner covers.<br />Since the chapters are short, you can do two or three a night without losing continuity.  At the same time, the story has enough depth and cleverness that the parent can remain engaged.  Thus, it's a catalyst for bonding.<br />One of the things that makes it special is the main character. Elmer Elevator, on the advice of a stray cat, starts out on a noble odyssey to free a baby dragon from its animal tormentors.  In his preparation, Elmer packs dozens of seemingly useless items, including a magnifying glass, brush, sandwiches, and lollipops.  While he travels across Wild Island, all these items become essential, and you wonder if the story was being told by MacGyver :-)<br />We've read the trilogy to completion five times and it's still a hit with everyone.	2002-11-06

For example, training based on time at particular heart rate thresholds -- NOT mileage -- is now the generally accepted method of optimizing your development.<br />This is a relatively quick and easy read providing hints and tips on working up in the distances.  One may initially interpret the casual, non-snooty writing style to suggest it would be appropriate for beginner.  It's not.  I think you should really have at LEAST a year of riding experience before ratcheting up the mileage.  For example, their demarcation of &quot;long distance&quot; is roughly sub-century (&lt; 100 miles), century, double (200 miles), and beyond 200 miles.<br />It was especially interesting to read their insight into the physiology of higher mileage levels.  For example, once you're riding centuries comfortably, success in the additional distances essentially depends upon eating and hydrating effectively.  Those who made their first transition beyond the 40-60 mileage range without eating are familiar with &quot;the bonk.&quot;<br />A couple of nits:  First, the book assumes the &quot;long distance&quot; will be an all-the-way-through event.  I would have been especially interested material on multi-day events, specifically on nutritional &quot;tricks&quot; one might use to restock the body's primary glycogen stores.  They suggest generally eating a high-carbohydrate meal within 1/2 hour of the ride.<br />Another -- probably humorous -- question is &quot;how do you find time for these longer rides?&quot;	2002-08-03

Where this book is especially valuable is in keeping things simple -- without the intimidating mathematical notation -- while providing examples of where statistics can be used to measure the wrong things or present results that do not make sense in the context of what the researcher is investigating.<br />My favorite example illustrates how a stastical analysis of a new test that identifies those susceptible to a fatal disease &quot;shows&quot; an increase in the average lifespan of both populations (those who suffer the disease and those who don't).  The reality, of course, is no one is living longer because of the test, but rather the population sampled is different.  Brilliant and concise.<br />Although the text is targeted towards those in the bioinformatic and medical vocations, it's useful beyond that because the presentation of concepts is practical and yet without the notation.	2002-07-05

My favorite article was on the research done on Caenorhabditis elegans, a small (1 mm long) soil nematode found in temperate regions.  Although C.elegans has no economic impact on humans, its importance, which the article explains, is both in the primitiveness of the organism and the commonality it has with many human biological functions.  The book explains this fascinating stuff very well to the layman.<br />As the editor notes, genetics is still in its \\"gestational stage,\\" and the book is obviously limited in its snapshot into research.  Indeed, only a few years later the first pass of sequencing the human genome was completed earlier than planned.<br />Two minor complaints about the book are the similarity in some of the stories and the lack of pointers to additional resources...	2001-11-22

The book oozes with examples and case study snippets, helping one see the practicality of the models as tools in exploring decisions.<br />While Excel has a lot of features, one cannot help but feel like it's a hammer in search of nails.  For example, LINDO (not included on the disk) may be easier to work with than the Excel Solver for some problems.  Similarly, tools like Crystal Ball, which is included on the CD and runs within Excel, are rarely mentioned.<br />Many of the included Excel macros were based on Excel version 4, meaning that if you have more recent versions, like Excel 2000, you may encounter difficulties loading them because the security model for the earlier macros is different.  You can work around this by selecting Tools -&gt; Macros -&gt; Security, setting medium security, then selecting Tools -&gt; AddIns and loading the macro (e.g., Treeplan).  Once you do this, you can set security back to &quot;High&quot; for better protection.	2001-09-28

As another reviewer noted, the fast food industry itself is portrayed as neither good nor evil. Rather, it's a business responsible for generating continuous growth and profits for its shareholders. The strategies employed to accomplish this are not for the meek. (And later, in the discussion of McDonald's in the UK, can seem underhanded.) Scholosser looks at the stores, food growers, the flavor factories and the meat packing industry. He does a thorough examination of a LIttle Caesar's store, including accompanying a driver during his evening pizza deliveries. Dave Feamster, the owner of the Fort Collins franchise, is portrayed as a rare hero because he's actually providing a decent work environment for his employees. The background on Simplot is very interesting, as is his description of a french fry factory. &quot;Potatoes are hurled in excess 100 feet per second towards a stainless steel cutting lattice.&quot; I found his description of natural versus artificial chemicals enlightening: one is not worse than the other. I would have loved to learn more about the flavor industry; however we learn that it's very secretive about its research. The section on the meatpacking industry is disgusting. On the other hand, it IS curious that the industry is still, by and large, manual because &quot;cattle come in different shapes and sizes.&quot; Schlosser includes a very extensive bibliography and source listing. I look forward to to exploring this further. I'd also love to see a followup in 5-10 years.	2001-08-25

The premise of Pfeffer's book is that companies' success is directly correlated to the quality of people and their management.  This seems like common sense.  After all, many companies proclaim &quot;people are our biggest asset.&quot;  In practice, however, it's uncommon sense: companies often lack the deep conviction necessary to follow through.  It's much easier to take a &quot;tough love&quot; approach to &quot;management,&quot; cut training and lay off 10% of the workforce than it is to focus on the long-term people issue.<br />Based on his research, Pfeffer offers several HR practices that are common in effective organizations.  Among them:<br />* Maintain a sense of employment security.  Psychologically speaking,  people will work more effectively when they can focus on doing their job  rather than worrying about keeping it.  Similarly, if employees are your  company's hugest asset, then it behooves you to ensure they're not  working for your competition.  This is common sense.  More companies practice uncommon sense and get sucked into the  peformance death-spiral.  For example, we frequently read where a new  CEO is brought in and his first action is to initiate layoffs.  (Apple  Computer is an often-cited case study of this.)  With their sense of security threatened, the remaining employees will  become less motivated.  Profits begin to sag, so the company reacts by  cutting training.  Employees may have more accidents, and customer  service is affected.  The spiral continues until it or the company  broken.<br />* Hire selectively - a recurring theme is that to avoid layoffs, you  need to be operating efficiently enough not to *have* extra employees.<br />  In a perfect world, we would have a large number of applicants, screen  them based on corporate fit and their attitude, then filter them out  through several rounds of screening.  Senior staff should become  involved in the latter part of the process to emphasize the importance  of hiring.  After hiring, we need to evaluate the success of our hiring practices  and adjust them as necessary.  This follows the axiom &quot;that which gets  measured, gets done.&quot;  This common sense approach is used by highly  successful companies such as Southwest Airlines and Cisco.  Companies exhibiting &quot;uncommon sense&quot; may get so desperate to fill the  position that they go against their own guidelines.  Having made this  mistake before, I am very much aware that a bad hire is far worse than  no hire.<br />* Facilitate ownership and responsibility through decentralized decision making.<br />  Assuming you hire the &quot;best and brightest,&quot; you should trust them to use  their brains.  This provides a sense of ownership, challenge, and  supports the organization's organic development.  We all hope to have  the equivalent of the &quot;Post-It&quot; note developed internally by folks  taking initiative.<br />  Pfeffer had an interesting comment from Bill Gurley about the effectiveness  of stock options.  Specifically, they're not really as much a sense of  ownership as we'd like to believe because if the market has a violent  downswing (as it did in early 2000), employees are almost incented to  leave their underwater options.<br />-<br />Pfeffer's book is an evolution of his previous ideas.  What's also interesting  in his analysis was seeing that long-term company success was *not* correlated  to technology or industry.<br />Pfeffer's suggestions seem like common sense, but Pfeffer realizes they're not AND is aware of the need to quantify the information.  The case studies and quantitative research are very helpful in supporting these ideas.  In a few of the cases -- Lincoln Electric springs to mind -- it would be especially helpful to have a more recent examination, perhaps a follow-up.of hiring.

In a few of the cases -- Lincoln Electric springs to mind -- it would be especially helpful to have a more recent examination, perhaps a follow-up.	2000-09-20

The story is relatively simple - we see things Nicholas likes to do during the year.  As  Nicholas progresses through the year, we have a sense of the changing  seasons: initially everything is green and lush, then reddish as the leaves  fall, and finally bluish-white for winter.<br />The illustrations are superbly  done, with fine attention to detail.  Each leaf, each butterfly, each frog  is different and laydbugs abound.<br />The book itself is bound on very  thick cardboard and thus will last for quite a while.  It's a very worthy  addition to your child's library and will be treasured for years to come.	2000-09-20

It also provide the  mental &quot;glue&quot; that I needed to see how my Exchange servers would  interact.<br />A few of the registry keys were different as a result of the  most recent service packs.  This is forgivable given the book's always  going to lag the product, and the differences weren't that horrible.<br />If  you're tasked with doing any amount of work with Exchange, you really need  this book.	2000-09-18

For example in the electrical section, it talks  about how electricity is typically wired in a home.  It further offers  guidelines on such things as the number of receptaccles per (15 amp)  circuit and how a layout of circuits might look around your home.<br />A minor  nit is the book lacks is a way to estimate how appropriate a given task is  for you.  For example, they talk about installing and removing a bathtub,  but don't include any conventional warning like &quot;Are you out of your  mind?&quot; or &quot;Maybe you should not attempt this.&quot;  (Removing  and installing bathtubs is considered to be both time consuming and labor  intensive.)<br />Overall, this is a great reference book for the homeowner and  provides great diagrams and descriptive text of tasks you may soon need to  attempt.	2000-08-30

However, the biggest pitfall of this book is it's dated.  At best, I think the book is useful for when you're (a) desperate or (b)  about to throw a broken thing away.  For example, if your toaster oven  breaks, odds are this will provide enough general information to convince  you it's OK to take it apart and fish around, then call the manufacturer  (e.g., Black &amp; Decker is great about this) and order replacement  parts.<br />On the other hand, as many appliances are solid-state (e.g., no  tubes) AND individual parts are difficult to procure if the manufacturer  doesn't support this.  [In 1977, when the book was published, you could go  to your local Radio Shack and buy a 100 ohm 1/4 watt resistor.  It's  increasingly difficult to find such things as the business models have  changed to the more lucrative cell phones.)<br />This is a useful book if you  want a general idea of how common things work and aren't afraid to use a  screwdriver.  It's not going to be as helpful as it was 20 years ago,  however.	2000-08-30

Where it excels is by providing an estimate of how  long and what kind of skills would be required for a particular task, any  special tools, and whether or not you will need a second hand.<br />For  example, if your toilet leaks at the base, there's a bit of disassembly  you'll need to do.  Most toilets are pretty heavy and you might want help  in taking it off the floor and later holding it while you align the floor  bolts.<br />Unless you're paying attention, you'll tend to underestimate the  amount of time and effort for a task.  For example, the guide lists  &quot;installing a standard light switch&quot; as a 15-30 minute item.  This doesn't include installing the box (1-2 hours), plus the various tools  you'll need (fish tape, optional conduit, wire, etc.).<br />The book should be  viewed as a rough guide for a particular task. You have to make an honest  assessment on your skills for these things.  In some cases, it will save  you grief suppressing your ego and consulting a professioanl.	2000-08-30

The Gleim book has a more thorough  coverage on regulations and maneuvers.<br />Any guide like this should be a  supplement to a review with your CFI. Most examiners have particular areas  they wish to emphasize -- usually based on previous applicants or trends  from the FAA/NTSB inspectors.<br />Where this book is deficient, and this  is largely because the nature of the commercial rating, is its description  of advanced systems.  This is because for the commercial, you take part or  all of your checkride using a complex (retractible gear, cowl flaps,  controllable pitck prop), airplane.  The seriousness of the rating requires  that you know a *lot* about the aircraft.  Successful applicants will bond  with the pilot operating handbook, as well as &quot;memorize&quot; the  placement of every gage, knob and instrument.<br />For the purposes of review,  Mr Hayes assumes you have a Cessna 172RG, which is not a bad guess as it's  among the cheaper and more ubiquitous training retractible airplanes  available.  He does a good job covering the basics of the 172rg differences  (hydraulic landing gear, cowl flaps and prop).  To his credit, he makes an  attempt at including suggested power settings for the maneuvers.

Though not as trendy as Genghis Khan's (or insert historical leader name  here) management book, &quot;All I really need to know...&quot; is a pretty  quick read with several interesting anecdotes and points to take  away.<br />Three things that I believe would be directly applicable to any  company:<br />1. Have a direction and be able to articulate it.  Everyone  within the organization should be able to do the &quot;elevator  pitch.&quot;  This basically means know what you're doing, why it's  important, who else is doing it, and why you are (or will be) better at it  than they are.<br />2. Continuously improve.  As the joke goes, &quot;they  usually get it right by version 3.0.&quot;  However, you can't deny that  Microsoft has excelled at is refinement of its products based on input from  customers, developers, and even other vendors.  The result is the products  get better.<br />3. Keep everyone challenged.  A fault many employers have is  they tend to corral an employee good at doing &quot;X&quot; into that role  &quot;forever.&quot;  Assuming your employee had no further ambitions,  that's fine.  However, you probably wouldn't want an unambitious employee  in a high-power organization, you'll have to keep them interested.  The  answer: move them around to develop their skills and keep them engaged.	2000-08-30

They note that gas heaters cost more to install, but you'll usually  save the amount in the utility bill.<br />They offer insight into add-on  options.

To some extent, it is &quot;marketing 101,&quot; and thus won't  substitute for a competent product manager.  However, I have seen too many  companies neglect planning only to be caught at inopportune times.<br />The  first section deals with assessing the marketplace and determining the  feasibility of your offering.  I think a lot of dotcoms have glossed over  the &quot;Who is the customer,&quot; section hoping to &quot;grab  marketshare.&quot;  (&quot;Of which market?!&quot;)<br />Section two concerns  developing your positioning and marketing plan.  Some of this is done when  evaluating your offering and competition, but it's useful to make a rough  schedule of your external campaigns, as well as preparing for packaging (if  it's an end user product) and internal marketing (letting your sales people  know what you're going to offer before they hear it from customers.<br />The  last section is a post-mortem, intended to prepare you for the next product  launch.  It's key to wrap up any marketing programs and plan on doing  objective analyses of what worked and didn't so it doesn't happen  again.<br />Overall, I like this book and think it complements  &quot;Engineering your start-up&quot; (Michael Baird) and &quot;High Tech  Startup&quot; (Nesheim).

The book expounds upon three  points very well:<br />1. Know yourself.  Understand why you are considering  a business school, determine what you expect to get out of it, and identify  which programs are best for *your needs*.  Be honest with  yourself.<br />Assuming you've determined an MBA program is the way you need  to go, you have to determine which offering is most appropriate.  Objectively evaluate schools, don't blindly go off of the numerous  &quot;rankings.&quot;  These are purely quantitative and may not be the  best fit.  (For example, if you want to do marketing and not finance,  Northwestern might be a better choice than Wharton.)  Evaluate programs,  interview alumni and current students, and VISIT campus.  Pay attention to  any &quot;gut&quot; feel.<br />2. Market your strengths and weaknesses.<br />The  ideal applicant will have a 4.0 undergraduate GPA, 800 GMAT, speak  seventeen languages, served president of IBM, and have several gold medals  in swimming.  If this doesn't describe you, you're &quot;just folks&quot;  (to borrow from Harry Bauld) and need to market yourself.<br />Montauk has  some interesting generalizations for backgrounds (e.g., engineer, sales)  and their general strengths and weaknesses.<br />One valuable suggestion is to  choose and manage your recommenders. They should say what they want, and in  their own words, but you can help guide the perspectives they emphasize on  your candidacy so you come across as a multidimensional applicant.<br />The  essay writing suggestions are generally very good, especially the  &quot;angle&quot; that some of the questions are taking.  (This is very  similar to the &quot;Knock 'em Dead&quot; by Martin Yate.)  However, for  actually writing your essay, I would strongly recommend reading &quot;On  Writing the College Application Essay&quot; by Harry Bauld.<br />3.

Although we're  inclined to think nobel laureates will pore over our applications, the  reality is they're screened by the Sarah Bleary and Henry Haggards of the  world: real folks who see so many applications, that they struggle to  differentiate them.<br />Knowing your audience is only one part of the  equation.  In the essay, you must convince the reader that you're YOU.  Instead, many applicants portray themselves based on what they think the  admissions committee wants, often to the extent of sweeping banalities.  Bauld explores several of these with his sharp wit. Perhaps the funniest is  Pet Death: &quot;As I watched Buttons' life ebb away, I came to value the  important things in this world.&quot;<br />In the second half, Bauld suggests  you take a chill pill, then start keeping a notebook of any ideas an  observations -- anything.  Eventually you'll start to relax enough that  your writing will come alive.  However, before it can come alive, you must  get something on paper.<br />You'll continuously refine and tighten your  opus, and the author gives several suggestions of how to approach this,  with examples of first, second and third drafts.<br />Finally, Bauld  includes several different essays, a few from college applications, and  most not.  Each of these conveys a different style but illustrates the crux  of the book: you gotta be you.	2000-08-27

Viewed another way, The Savvy Flight Instructor picks up where the FAA's  Fundamentals of Instruction left off.<br />In addition to discussing how to  successfully build a career out of flight instruction, Mr Brown presents a  marketing plan: how to position yourself, where to find prospective  students (and how to advertise), determining how serious they are, closing  &quot;the deal&quot; and maintaining &quot;customer satisfaction.&quot;<br />Having worked with over 25 different instructors in the last five years,  I found the customer satisfaction (and projecting professionalism) sections  are wonderful.  These should be required reading because too often we  forget that students *are customers* - they need to feel important, should  have their expectations set accurately, can be recurring customers, AND are  the best form of advertising.  We're not competing amongst each other as  much as we are against other ways to use disposable income (e.g., a $6000  jjet-ski).<br />Finally, Mr Brown offers specific suggestions for flight  schools.  Some of these are no-brainers like &quot;keep the airplanes  well-maintained,&quot; but there are some more subtle ideas like  incorporate a formal ground school (often overlooked), set expectations on  how students will be billed (instructors are prone to not bill for time;  this also encourages more efficient planning) and incentives for  instructors to minimize burnout.<br />This is a great reference for the career  instructor as well as the CFI building time for his or her airline job.	2000-08-27

It's not a book you'd read cover-to-cover, because it's *very*  detailed in some of its analyses.  It's a good reference and can be used to  augment your ground schooling for the commercial pilot written exam.<br />In  Private Pilot school, you learned to do a weight and balance, with a vague  semblance that being too heavy was &quot;bad.&quot;  You also learned to  stay within the c.g. (center of gravity) envelope.  You were told that if  you are in turbulence, slow down to &quot;minimum maneuvering speed.&quot;  What you probably didn't know is why.  Kershner spends almost half of the  book exploring performance and stability and talks about what might happen  to the airplane in certain regions of the performance envelope.<br />For the  Cessna 152 and Cessna 172 pilot, there are also sections discussing  &quot;advanced systems&quot; such as retractable gear, controllable pitch  (aka &quot;constant speed&quot;) propeller, turbo charging, and high  altitude operations.  These are less thorough than the stability and  performance section, but are nonetheless a good introduction.<br />The last  third of the book is intended to help prepare for the FAA exam.  As the  book is several years old, the questions (and supplementary material) for  the written exam will have changed a bit and should be viewed as  &quot;practice questions&quot; with answers.<br />The ten pages devoted to the  practical exam are useful.  The Gleim book for the Commercial Pilot  practical test is probably going to be more helpful.	2000-08-27

This book seems to work at two levels: For the youngest (&lt;1) children, the contrasting silhouettes provide an interesting thing to focus on while  you read the text.  (The theory being that infants won't have fully  developed their eyesight, but can be &quot;stimulated&quot; by high  contrasting patterns.)  Slightly older (1-2 1/2) have fun identifying the  shapes towards the end of the book.<br />Whereas the &quot;Mr Brown can  Moo&quot; book emphasizes aural development, this focuses on visual.  My  toddler seems to enjoy it, although &quot;One Fish&quot; still ranks  higher.	2000-08-24

However, what most appeals to us is  how the book is designed to teach your child the names of things in the  household by providing rhyming &quot;clues.&quot;  For example, &quot;there  are nub boards in my ... cup boards.&quot;<br />My child really enjoys being  able to complete the sentences, and this book is in her top fifteen.	2000-08-24

The gorilla, with all of the animals following him,  ends up in the zookeeper's bedroom.<br />The pictures are terrific, with a lot  going on in the background. There's a little mouse toting the gorilla's  banana, each animal's cage has a toy, and, of course, the zookeeper's  wife's surprise and familiarity with the animals following him home.<br />My  daughter's definitely picked up some rather complex animal names (e.g.,  giraffe, armadillo) and picked up on the gorilla's shenanigans pretty  quickly.<br />Very fun book.	2000-08-20

Along the way, other creatures -- frog, mole, caterpillar, bear, squirrel  -- offer suggestions on where to look for home.  The book has the expected  happy ending. The book is on very stiff paper, and should endure at least a  week of chewing.<br />What doesn't work is the squeak toy.  I found it a bit  obnoxious because it's either too stiff for a child to push or too lound.  (It's a shame they couldn't make it go &quot;baaaaaaaa&quot; instead of  squeak.)	2000-08-20

For example, the book points out the concrete truck's drum rotates  both directions, one to mix the concrete (and prevent it from setting) and  the other to pour the mixture out.<br />It's one of her favorites and she's  memorized all of the names (listening to a 24 month old say &quot;mobile  home toter&quot; is pretty funny).  As she gets older, she'll have more  appreciation for the footnotes.<br />I also appreciate how the book displays  trucks from different locales.  For example, we don't see any &quot;Road  Trains&quot; or &quot;Trial Trucks&quot; in the 'States.	2000-08-20

This book attempts to clear up  ambiguity by analyzing the regulations in FAR parts 1 (definitions), 61  (airmen), 91 (conditions of flight) and NTSB 830 (reporting incidents and  accidents).<br />It's a pity this book hasn't been updated in five years  because it's a good reference.  Each section of FAR parts is examined,  usually with a plain-language explanation, references to Advisory Circulars  or other regulations, National Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB) rulings  and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) chief counsel opinions.<br />For  example, many pilots get confused regarding 61.118, &quot;private Pilot  Privileges and Limitations: Pilot in Command.&quot;  This is the section  that attempts to spell out when a private (versus &quot;commercial&quot;)  pilot may be compensated for a flight.  Subsection (b) specifies a pilot  &quot;may share the operating expenses of a flight with his  passengers.&quot;<br />While this would seem pretty straightforward, people  interpret this in ways that the FAA didn't intend.  Consider three  scenarios:<br />1.  I am a software engineer and have a business trip to  Portland.  My salesman, who wants to sell more widgets, and I fly and I  submit the actual rental and parking expenses for reimbursement from my  company.<br />2.  Friends of mine are parachute jumpers and pay me to carry  them up so they can jump.  I charge them $100 of the $150 it would cost me  to go on the trip.<br />3.  A friend wants me to fly her to Friday Harbor.  I  charge her for half of the gas, oil, parking, insurance, and  maintenance.<br />As the &quot;Federal Aviation Regulations Explained&quot;  might point out, #1 is legal because the flight is incidental to my job  (programming).<br />#2 is not legal because I'm not really making the trip  for my own purposes.  In this case, FAR Explained points out the NTSB case  &quot;Administrator v. Reimer, 3 NTSB 2306 (1980), where the pilot was  found in violation because there was no common purpose.  The pilot's motive  was to build hours partially paid for by others.<br />#3 is not legal, either,  because the passenger would not be paying out of pocket expenses.  Insurance and maintenance are usually factored over a period of  time.<br />According to the FAA Counsel opinion, in #1, I would be able to  expense it and build flight hours because the destination is where I have a  paritcular business incidental to flying for a living.<br />The FARs can be  painful to read, but this book helps clear some of the ambiguity and  provide some background on NTSB and FAA interpretations such that a pilot  won't be caught by surprise.tor v.

This is a good overview of some of the things that might go wrong.  The underlying philosophy behind the book is that if emergency procedures are  learned and practiced, they cease to be emergencies and rather just more  procedures.<br />An example happened earlier this year when I was flying with  a friend who had recently transitioned to a complex airplane (one with  retractable landing gear).  On final approach, he didn't get the &quot;all  green&quot; lights on the gear (meaning the gear was not securely locked  down for landing).  With a gear not locking, the plane is still perfectly  flyable, and indeed, we had four hours of fuel left.  Although you'd  obviously prefer not to, you CAN land with the gear up without doing undo  harm to you or the plane (but not your ego :)<br />Since I was in the right  seat, I offered to trouble shoot while he continued flying.  Trouble  shooting involves working down the checklist and doing things like swapping  out bulbs and making sure metal contacts are not dirty -- not very  complicated, but involved enough that a second person makes life easier.  After tinkering with the light bulbs, I looked up to see my friend was,  shall we say, in a self-induced unusual attitude.  HE FORGOT TO KEEP FLYING  THE PLANE.<br />This is a where he would have benefitted from practicing the  emergency procedures in order to build confidence and react more positively  to the situation.<br />Handling In-Flight Emergencies covers engine failure,  VFR into IFR conditions, electrical failure, control system failure, and  getting found after being &quot;temporarily lost.&quot;  The book should be  read in the spirit that these are things to think about, work with your  preferred instructor.  I feel it's successful at that.<br />For the various  control system failures and how to work around them, I recommend Rich  Stowell's &quot;Emergency Maneuver Training&quot; book and video.  They are  very thorough and take a scientific approach to the situations.  (Stowell  is also able to explain aerodynamics without boring you.)ons.

The first gives you examples of the forms and differences between the three classes of  medicals.<br />Part II deals with special issuances.  If you don't meet the  FAA's stated medical standards, you should investigate getting a statement  of demonstrated ability (SODA).  This section suggests how you would go  about getting more information and use your specialists' opinion to support  your cause.<br />The final section is in question and answer format,  subdivided by particular areas of concern, such as high blood pressure,  hearing loss, and vision problems.<br />If you're concerned about obtaining  and maintaining your medical, this is very good reading.	2000-08-17

I don't remember much distinction  between  the sixth and seventh editions, the eighth edition is much better  than the third.<br />The eighth edition cleans up some of the looser ends of  its predecessors and the presentations are more orthogonal.  Most major  single and twin piston engine aircraft are covered and the format is a tech  sheet showing the aircraft -- useful load, fuel, speed, basic dimensions  and schematic profile -- followed by a summary of the model's history,  quirks and foibles.  Most models include pricing and all have at least a  few owner stories.<br />What I don't like about the Used Aircraft Guide is the  information is really a barebones summary.  Make no mistake, Aviation  Consumer is wonderful at being brutally honest, but the amount of coverage  involved in all of these models necessitates that they be brief.  They do  provide pointers to type clubs, e.g., Cessna Pilot Association, Cherokee  Pilots Association.  These organizations would have far more experience  with a particular model.<br />Although they've made some effort to incorporate  new comments from the magazine's coverages -- notably on the Piper Archer  and its maintenance pricing -- some of the owner contributions are often  recycled from previous editions.  For example, the Cessna 170 has an owner  comment from someone who I *know* had a ten year hiatus for medical  reasons.<br />Detracting from the usefulness of reviews is the fact that most  owners eventually rationalize their decision to own a particular model.  I  know this will happen to me soon :-)  The owner comments, on a macro level,  tend to look favorably on any given model.  You could almost generalize  them as this:<br />---<br />  I've owned my FrogMeister 172 for several years.<br />  It's been a good plane and will carry a decent load  over an  acceptable distance for a modest amount of fuel.  When I bought the  plane, it had some problems, but  because I take very good care of it,  it's fine now.<br />  I would recommend FrogMeister owners join the  FrogMeister  Appreciation Club for the latest information on  modifications.  The FAC has been very helpful in finding a  mechanic  who really knows the nuances and quirks of the  FrogMeister.<br />  Were  I to purchase again, I wouldn't hesitate to buy a  FrogMeister.  However, I can't overemphasize the importance  of an adequate  pre-flight inspection.<br />---<br />If you've narrowed down prospective  ownership to a couple of models, you would be better off buying the  appropriate back-issues of Aviation Consumer and joining the type club for  more specifics.  (For example, I know the Cessna Pilot's Association  publishes buyers guides for the 182 and 210.)<br />If, instead, you're  interested in a general overview of lots of general aviation planes, then  this is a fine book for that purpose.When I bought the  plane, it had some problems, but      because I take very good care of it,  it's fine now.<br />    I would recommend FrogMeister owners join the  FrogMeister     Appreciation Club for the latest information on       modifications.

Think of it as an opportunity to leverage Sparky (his real  name) Imeson's &gt;10000 hours of experience flying small planes in the  mountains.  (And if that isn't enough qualification, Imeson's won the  Northwest CFI of the year three times.)  For flatlanders, when you see  &quot;mountain,&quot; substitute &quot;extremes,&quot; because this is  really what you'll get: flying the airplane at the corner of the  performance envelope.<br />This is a terrific book because it's laid out in  five sections representing the phases of flight: preflight, takeoff, en  route, arrival and landings.  Each section is divided further into logical  subcategories of things one needs to know during that phase of  flight.<br />Each page is chock full of information and there are hundreds of  &quot;rules of thumb.&quot;  Also supplementing the text are some excellent  photographs providing a visual picture often missing in other texts.  For  example, the En Route section shows you how difficult power lines across  canyons are to see.  Coming straight at it, you *can't* see the lines, but  when you're right over them, you can.<br />The arrival and landing section  shows how unusual some fo the runways can look.  Included are sight  pictures of Big Creek and Indian Creek(ID), Aspen, Mt Blackburn (one of my  favorites in Alaska), and &quot;Gros Ventre International&quot; near  Jackson, Wyoming.  These pictures show the extremes, including extremely  high altitudes, gravel, crooked strips, runways with varying slope, and  very short fields.<br />You'll come away with new information each time you  read the book.	2000-08-03

As you work  through the equations, you realize that in 20 feet, the cable will have  lost all ten megawatts (due to the resistance of the copper) and will reach  a temperature of over 3500 kelvin (gaseous copper, anyone?).<br />The  practical angle is: the result is obviously preposterous.  You'd really use  multiple cables and supplies.<br />What's also impressive about the book is  they cover so much, ranging from basic microelectronics to building a  signal convertor with the Motorola 68008 (with code supplied!).	2000-08-01

Adds depth to an already excellent cinematic experience	The shooting script contains forewards (by Stephen King by Frank Darabont), the screenplay, changes from the screenplay to the movie, some final thoughts by Darabont, and the credits.<br />It's fascinating reading the  screenplay after seeing the movie, then reading the changes made in to the  screenplay and why.  For example, in scene 36, Andy approaches Red to buy a  rock hammer and they agree on ten dollars.  In the movie, it just happens  and we overlook the question on how Andy would have gotten the money in the  first place.<br />In the screen play, we find out in scenes 40 and 41 where  he got the money (brought in with him ... internally).  However, later, the  book explains how the scene read well, but didn't work well on the screen.  In retrospect, we don't really *care* that he had money anyway, so the  scene is easily dropped without sacrificing clarity.<br />The book adds some  interesting &quot;inside&quot; information.  For example, when we first see  Red meeting with the parole board, the file has a picture of him when he  was younger.  This photo is actually a cameo by Morgan Freeman's son,  Alfonso, who also provided some of the background voices during the  &quot;Fresh Fish&quot; taunting in the early part of the movie.<br />Overall,  the book adds depth to an already excellent cinematic experience.	2000-07-31

(Because of the timing involved,  there's not very much about DS9 or Voyager.  This is covered in the  supplemental volume.)<br />All of the episodes in TOS and TNG have a summary  and most (&gt;95%) have some behind-the-scenes arcana.  There is  surprisingly little &quot;[actor] was also in [other feature]&quot; type  stuff, but rather juicier background on all of the writing and directorial  changes.<br />While the honesty in stating &quot;Star Trek 1 was  terrible&quot; is refreshing, it seems like the authors dwell more on the  &quot;problem&quot; aspects of the show.  For example, in discussing the  episode &quot;City on the Edge of Forever,&quot; the authors spend a much  longer amount of time on the Harlon Ellison saga (Ellison writes the story,  it gets butchered into an episode, both win awards, Roddenbery and Ellison  at odds over credit).<br />The result is a less-than-flattering portrayal of  Gene Roddenbery. (To be fair, I came away a greater awareness of and  respect for Gene Coon and Rick Berman.)<br />Overall, a worthy read for the  die-hardest Trekker.	2000-07-31

Little bear plays the straight man, er, bear, to Papa Bear.<br />For example, when surfing, Papa Bear tells Little Bear to look out for rocks.  Little  Bear points out rocks, but Papa Bear says they're the surf's &quot;too far  away&quot; as  a wave comes and sweeps them onto .. the rocks.  Papa bear  then says &quot;On the other hand...&quot;<br />I think this is a great book  for a toddler because  they can pick up the sense of ironic contradiction.  Papa bear tells Little Bear a rule, tries to overlook it, gets in trouble,  then spins it to be a perfect example of why that rule's a rule.	2000-07-17

Thinking he's been overlooked, he ventures out to discover  that society has been unraveled.<br />As the story progresses, we learn more  on the origins of the Triffids  and Bill Masen's connection with them.<br />Wyndham doesn't bog the reader down with the minutae of genetic  engineering, but presents enough plausible background to the story  that  one can enjoy the book today or half a century ago.<br />Wyndham also explores  the &quot;what ifs&quot; as society attempts to rebuild  itself and debate  how it can accomodate the blind into the new society.	2000-07-14

I hadn't used ASP before, but assumed it would be like any other programming  language.  My  experience with Nutshell books is that they provide good summaries for this  sort of thing, and &quot;ASP in a Nutshell&quot; is no exception.<br />Most  of the methods are shown with short examples -- which is great.  Unfortunately, not all of the options to the methods are supported, even on  MSFT-based environments, which I assume would be the dominant consumers of  ASP.  It would have been beneficial to indicate these a little more  explicitly.<br />The book gives a good overview of the Response, Request, and  Session objects.  It makes an earnest attempt to cover Active Data Objects  (ADO), however, as the author concedes, a thorough exploration of that is  another book entirely.  This is unfortunate because the primary  reason  people use ASP is to connect to a back-end database.<br />There is a  reference to another, forthcoming book, &quot;ADO: The Definitive  Guide,&quot; by Jason T. Roff, which purports to cover these  &quot;advanced&quot; topics. Although a &quot;ASP in a Nutshell&quot; is a  competent reference, the Roff book (when published) may have been a better  solution for my particular needs.	2000-07-14

Not only is it a longer test (100 questions) but it covers a broader range of issues in the  &quot;for hire&quot; category.  For example, you can expect questions on  everything ranging from currency for glider towing to the three definitions  of &quot;night&quot; to positional awareness.  And just to make sure you  haven't forgotten your instrument training, there are a few approach  questions thrown into the mix.<br />Although the FAA publishes all of the  questions for the multiple-choice written tests, they do not provide the  correct answer.  This is where the &quot;Commercial Pilot Knowledge Test  Guide&quot; comes in.<br />It attempts to collect questions by logical  knowledge category, present a summary of the information you'll need to  know, then list all of the questions and their answers.<br />Thus, it's useful  for going over the material and &quot;cramming&quot; for the written test  -- as most people do -- but it's no substitute for a good ground schooling.<br />In reviewing the text, I found several errors which the publisher  attributed to the FAA changing its tests.  Unfortunately, the publisher  didn't offer any form of addendum.<br />Summary: it's adequate for passing the  written, but it's not useful beyond that.	2000-07-11

The idea is simple: if something goes wrong, you will know  enough to get out of it.<br />Stowell does a great job of walking you through  how an airplane flies.  What was especially useful was the description of  how one would design an airplane from the ground up.  Where he excels,  however, is presenting it in a clear fashion without boring the  reader.<br />The book includes descriptions on recovering from inversions  (perhaps you got caught in wake turbulence) to control systems failures  (split ailerons; stuck elevator).  I would also encourage  the video, which  complements the material well.	2000-07-07

The four-way clipboard  suggestion is an elegant solution compared to the well-armed instrument  gladiator look I was sporting -- you know, with multiple kneeboards and a  Post-It(tm) pad.<br />His analyses of the individual parts of the approach  and &quot;how the system&quot; works are helpful as well, especially with  both NOS and Jepp charts.  The only minus was the suggested scan  technique.  It didn't work for me and I thought it was a little cumbersome.	2000-07-06

Me either.  However, WCSSH does provide an immense entertainment value.<br />The material  is serious, but the collection makes me suspect there is a subtle sense of  humor behind it, which of course, affords the possibility for follow-ons  targeted towards our &quot;Real World&quot; lives, such as what to do  if:<br />*  Your dinner host serves red wine with shellfish<br />*  The IRS  wants to audit you<br />*  You get pulled over for driving way too fast in  Louisiana AND have out-of-state tags<br />*  During a company presentation,  you discover your fly is open<br />The information appears to be sound,  however it's obviously not intended to  convey knowledge beyond a  superficial level.  For example, in the &quot;How to Land An Airplane&quot;  example, it rightly suggests starting a landing at 1000 feet above ground,  but there's no indication how one determines what the airport elevation is.  A subtle point, but very important if you're attempting to land at  Seattle-Tacoma International (429 feet) or Boeing Field (18 feet) five  miles away.<br />Overall, it's a very entertaining book.	2000-07-05

For example, instead of &quot;Hickory Dickory Dock,&quot; they use &quot;Dickory dickory dock.&quot;<br />An informal search on [a website] shows &gt;1600 matches for &quot;Hickory&quot; and 9 for &quot;Dickory,&quot; so the former is clearly more common.  As best as we can determine, the original was published in 1744 as &quot;Hickere, Dickere, Dock&quot; in Tommy Thumb's Pretty Song Book II by Mary Cooper.

Schools are *not* ranked against each other.  There is a bunch of  supplemental material describing the application process and some sample  'good' essays.  The information is a little dated, but the book does  provide a basic starting point.<br />The overviews tend to follow a basic form  and are generally favorable in their description of each school -- these  are the 'top 75 business schools,' after all.  After reading (and  re-reading) the overviews, it became difficult to differentiate between  specific schools.  This is a problem.  A fictional example might be in this  form:<br />-------<br />  Business University's business program established  {many years ago}  by {insane monk, prominent business person, benevolent  megacorporation}.  The students describe the curriculum as  'rigorous, but fair.'  The school receives high marks for its {campus,  location, diversity,  team spirit, student friendliness}, but students  feel {MIS, parking,  career placement, professors in core classes} could  use improvement.<br />  Several students remarked 'the faculty is excellent  and professors can  walk and chew gum at the same time.'  However, some  disagree, 'not all  of the professors are great gum chewers.'<br />  The  first year students take core classes in accounting, finance,  marketing,  and gum chewing.  Second year students can select from  {a lot of really  cool} electives.<br />  The admissions committee considers {GPA, GMAT,  essays, recommendations,  prior work experience, credit worthiness, and  quality of penmanship}  all equally.  'We want a student with strong  {academics, leadership  potential, likelihood of donating,  well-roundedness} [...]<br />-------<br />Because the format has anonymous  comments and does not provide any sense of the scale or number of people  with a particular opinion about  the school, the two-page summaries  ultimately come across as wishy-washy.<br />The student surveys add some  color, but they, too, have flaws.  For example, Dartmouth appears at the  top of almost all of the 'good' attributes for each school (e.g., 'great  professors' 'strong marketing' 'strong teamwork').  I'm sure there are a  lot of happy people there, but I couldn't help but wonder if proud students  were  sandbagging the surveys to pump up their school.<br />Finally, any book  like this is only a snapshot of the school.  What ultimately should guide  your decision is whether the program and the environment meet your needs.

Machado's book covers a wealth of information and interjects a lot of humor to keep some of the drier areas (e.g,. airspace -- yawn) of aviation palatable.<br />I would recommend readers not get too hung up on the FAA  Knowledge Exam, aka &quot;the written test.&quot;  While this book IS an  excellent review for it -- except possibly the minor continuous changes in  FAA regulations -- it covers far more material.  As such, it's an  invaluable review for the practical test, as well as a reference when you  pursue your instrument and commercial ratings.  For example, among the  numerous diagrams and pictures, are some excellent cutaway illustrations of  instruments.  Supplementing this is a good discussion on instrument  limitations and errors.  Although the same material is in the FAA  Instrument Flying book, Machado's presentation is clearer.<br />Especially  nice are excerpts from ASRS (aka &quot;NASA form&quot;) reports about a  particular incident or accident germane to the topic at hand.  These help  provide the &quot;why&quot; behind the material, e.g., &quot;why do we  ALWAYS physically verify that both gas caps are tight?&quot;<br />The humor,  while welcomed, can be a little too much at times.

There is also a *great* section on  stress-management that everyone should read. The games are not very useful,  in my opinion.<br />The lessons have an emphasis on (re)building math  skills, although the test questions seemed much easier than on the  Princeton Review software.  More emphasis could be put on the verbal  sections as the Kaplan questions were, by far, the hardest of the  lot.<br />For practice essays, you can try [looking online]<br />As other readers have noted, the  exams scoring mechanism is punishing: I scored 100 lower on the Kaplan exam  than I did the actual test.  (versus 30 points lower on Princeton Review's  tests.)<br />Reviewing the exams was awkward, especially compared to the  Princeton Review software where you get a graphic overview of all of the  questions and how they rated in difficulty and how much time you spent on  each one.  (This is important in showing how the test &quot;adapts&quot; in  difficulty.)  Kaplan makes you review questions sequentially.<br />Kaplan  provides additional insight into some more subtle areas of testing such as  whether changing answers improves your score, and allows you to tailor a  lesson plan to your particular needs.  Obviously, the more time you have to  practice, the better.<br />I attribute my high score on the actual exam to  being smart, well-rested, and familiar with the test format.  The Kaplan  product is great for reviewing the format of the GMAT and would be  especially well-suited for someone who hasn't taken a standardized test in  a long time.<br />Finally, my advice for test takers:<br />  1. Do something  relaxing the night before.  (For example: Practice your Swedish Massage  lessons on your significant other. :-)<br />  2. Eat a good breakfast.<br />  3.
