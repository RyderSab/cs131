This book is obviously outstanding, and priced due to all the work it took in creating it and to whom it is marketed. <br /> <br />I received Michael Newton's Encyclopedia of Cryptozoology, late yesterday. <br />I will be writing a formal, published review, but I want to alert you to how <br />good it is. You should go out of your way to highly recommend it for <br />purchase by your local, school, or university library (the target audience <br />of a reference work like this). And for those serious cryptozoologists who <br />can afford it, for your personal research library, it, simply put, is a <br />*must* buy.  <br /> <br />Last night, I couldn't help myself, and stayed up until the wee hours of the <br />night, reading, flipping, reading more, surfing, reading, and smiling. What <br />a trip. Newton's got it down pat. Critical writing with a light hand and <br />open-mindedness to looking at all facets, in presenting cases, cryptids, and <br />evidence, as well as the overturning of media-driven hoax claims (Nessie <br />Surgeon Photos, Ray Wallace fiasco, and others). Most surprising of all the <br />entries I have read so far is Newton's reexamination of the supposed 1990 <br />expose' of Three-Toes, with a fresh look again at \\"all\\" elements of those <br />1948 events. This volume quite correctly is as skeptical of blanket <br />debunking claims as it is to the fast rush to specific cryptozoological <br />hypotheses. Newton logically critiques the various theories of <br />cryptozoologists who have ventured forth with their thoughts. His <br />discussion of the Minnesota Iceman, for example, in its total fairness to <br />several points of view, I found amazing. <br /> <br />There are 2,744 entries, including 112 individual biographies, 77 <br />cryptozoology groups described, and, of course, lots of location data, <br />cryptids detailed, and illustrations sprinkled throughout. It also has some <br />fantastic appendices that are comprehensive listings of new animal <br />discoveries, cryptofiction, cryptozoology in films, and cryptozoology on <br />television. At 576 pages in one oversized volume, it is a rather user <br />friendly reference work. <br />	2005-01-20

It really is too bad that one specific inappropriate review has been left up here.

Was there special helicopters  over Waco? Yes, of course there was.  This book gives a sense that things  are happening which may be merely a part of a plan still unexplained today.  Unfortunately, Keith will not be around to see his works appreciated within  this new enlightenment. That's too bad. And sad.But his books remain, for  all to mine for the little gems.

If you want to read an enjoyable, indepth look at the possible truths behind the James Bond books and films, pick up this brand new book.  Chapter Seven is a classic, truly a good, fun read thatgives indepth data  on what Ian Fleming had in mind regarding Bond and his villians. There's  convincing evidence that the supervillian Blofeld probably was based on the  reallife Aristotle Onassis.  The linkages are intriguing too, such as the  mysterious Area 51-type location, the Hughes-clone, the Onassis-clone, the  oil industry thatare evident in the 1972 Bond film based on Fleming's  *Diamonds are Forever*.I'll stop there, other than to mention that right  before Ian Flemingmysteriously died, he had apparently made arrangements to  fly up to NewJersey to talk to his old British intelligence service buddy,  Ivan T.Sanderson, according to this book.And that's just the tip of the  iceberg.  There's more history in this one book than in ten history  textbooks you'll find in your local school!  Highly recommended.	1999-08-04

There's enough information in the other reviews below for you to get an idea about the juvenile-level  nature of the cryptozoological contents.  For specific creationist  audiences, this is a good book. It may be difficult to swallow for others.  My only minor complaint - I wish they would have individually credited the  illustrations, as several artists worked on this tome, and it's difficult  to know (for the general public) which great illustration (these are the  highlight of the work for me) goes with which illustrator.  That's a  shame.Hey, instead of Sunday School homework, let your kid read this  book!--Loren Coleman,  Cryptozoology A to Z;The Field Guide to Bigfoot,  Yeti, and Other Mystery Primates Worldwide	1999-05-30

Furthermore, the master chronicler of as-yet-to-be-discovered animals has an updated  introduction for this edition.

Parker's book is an absolute must for the eastern cougar researcher, searcher, and tracker.  Parker details most efforts to discoverrecent data on the animals, reviews their history in America, and documents (through photos and text) examples of eastern panther taxidermy mounts found in museums and collections throughout the eastern section of the United States. To have all of this information in one place is worth the asking price of the book alone.  Great job Mr. Parker!	1999-05-21

J. P. O'Neill's new book, The Great New England Sea Serpent:   An Account of Unknown Creatures Sighted by Many Respected Persons Between 1638 and the Present Day, beside getting the trophy for the longest cryptozoological  book title of the year, this volume is a landmark in Sea-Serpent books.     It is intelligent, detailed, full of illustrations, chronologically  organized, with plenty of notes, and a great bibliography.  It gets high  marks from me for being truly cryptozoologically aware.	1999-05-15

The gaps are  minor - a couple of allegedly hoaxed photographs are included (an Ivan Marx  &quot;Bigfoot&quot; on a rock ledge and the de Loys's &quot;ape&quot;).   But those pictures don't distract from this being a short (42 pages of text  with 33 images) volume that hits the goal of overviewing a complex subject  nicely.  School libraries should buy this book to support the curious minds  of budding biologists, anthropologists, and cryptozoologists.  For the  young readers that start here, they will want to move on to The Field Guide  to Bigfoot, Yeti, and Other Mystery Primates Worldwide (Avon 1999; 224 pp)  next to learn another view - that all of these &quot;giant humanlike  beasts&quot; are not just the same thing, not a single species, and some  may indeed be Gigantopithecus, Paranthropus, and Homo erestus, as well.	1999-04-13

Richard Ellis takes us on a voyage of wonder and discovery in this book that is as big as the giant squid.  His passion for this creature, unknown to science and a monster of folklore until recently, certainly issues from  each page.  Ellis's gathering of rare and old images of this beast is worth  the reference nature of the work itself, but his text just makes it all  that more valuable. Being a cryptozoologist myself, I highly recommend this  volume as a vital and necessary addition to every public library, all  students of natural history, and the cryptozoologists around the world.   You will not be disappointed.	1999-03-31

Did you know that until New York socalite Ruth Harkness brought  Su Lin out of the jungles of Tibet to the United States in 1937, that the  existence of the giant panda still remained a mystery?  Loch Ness Monster,  Bigfoot, Abominable Snowman-these are the names of the elusive beasts that  have caught the eye and captured the imaginations of people around the  world for centuries.  Recently tales of these &quot;monsters&quot; as well  as an increase in the numbers of sightings has elevated these creatures,  and many others like the saola and the giant panda, from the shadowy world  of legend and footnotes in travelogues to the subjects of cryptozoology-the  study of hidden animals.Cryptozoology A to Z, the first encyclopedia of its  kind, contains nearly 200 entries of cryptids (the name given to these  unusual beasts), new animal finds, and the explorers and scientists who  search for them.  Loren Coleman, one of the world's leading  cryptozoologists teams up with Jerome Clark, esteemed editor and author of  several encyclopedias, to provide many never-before-published entries,  drawings and photographs from eyewitness' detailed accounts.  Full of  insight into the methods of these scientists, exciting tales of discovery,  and the history and evolution of this field, Cryptozoology A to Z is the  most complete reference ever of the newest zoological science.LOREN  COLEMAN, a forty-year veteran of cryptozoological field expeditions and  research, has written several books on nature's mysterious creatures,  including The Field Guide to Bigfoot, Mysterious America, and Tom Slick and  the Search for the Yeti, and has served as both on-and-off camera  consultant to NBC-TV's Unsolved Mysteries and A&amp;E's Ancient Mysteries.
