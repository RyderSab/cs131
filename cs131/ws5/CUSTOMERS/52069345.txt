It's a collection of Lee's notes put together after his death.<br />So, what you're getting is a buffet of disconnected observations and notes on what Lee learned as he studied the various classical styles of martial arts.<br />Even so, he was so insightful that one can gain a wealth of knowledge by reading it. A great reference guide for students of any level.	2002-09-20

The atmosphere of the novel is really strong: dark, gritty, forboding. Furst's expert knowledge of the day-to-day affairs of WWII Europe is first-rate, and adds to the realism.<br />Beyond that, there were several problems that I found distracting. The main character, deMilja, always seems remote and detached from the reader. I never got a sense of his personality and found myself struggling to stay interested in him. <br />The book is not a thriller, per se, but there were moments that attempted to be tense. In the execution, however, the tension deflated way too early and I never found myself on the edge of my seat.<br />Alan Furst has enormous potential, and I'm told that his later novels are much better--that he comes into his own as a writer. One can see his potential in the Polish Officer, which would make a great film: that medium might more effectively capture the emotion, depth of character, and tension that is lacking in the novel.	2002-09-16

Those who don't see it as serious science will have plenty of negative judgements of the book.<br />I don't think this is fair, however. The author says from the beginning that the discipline is in its infancy and much remains to be confirmed by further study. Yes, he says, the evidence is still anecdotal. But any scientific discipline starts with individuals daring to ask crazy questions, conducting experiments, and accepting harsh criticism from their contemporaries.<br />The evidence, anecdotal or not, is so overwhelming that one would have to be stupid to ignore the patterns. Furthermore, the author makes a good point: why do critics accept without question that animal behavior is rooted in genetic and evolutionary programming, but exempt humans from the same phenomenon? Why would we be the only species on the planet that are immune to this?<br />The Moral Animal is a fascinating read into human behavior and leaves readers wondering not why those apes at the zoo are so much like us, but rather why we're so much like them.	2002-08-29

The focus is on patterns--how to get the colors right, how to tie them, and what they imitate.<br />There's not much on casting technique or how to actually use them on the stream, but the material that is there is great. It has really useful patterns that are surprisingly easy to tie.	2002-08-26

Too often in academia, historical studies become an obscure vocabulary contest between professors trying to demonstrate their intellectual credentials, reducing their books to pedantic rambling. Even worse, they use complicated language to veil arguments that are not new or enlightening.<br />Not so Power of the Gun. McCord is as good a writer as he is a historian, and whether the reader knows a lot or nothing about the subject, he or she will gain a strong understanding of the material and a firm sense of the various schools of thought on warlords. Highly recommended.	2002-08-26

This approach has always been usable only as a general guide to leadership behavior, but it's all we've got. This book does it as well as any other, but a reader should know that it's not written in a narrative style, but rather in a reference format. Highly useful.	2002-07-26

Many of them come off looking pretty self-serving, with many deeply involoved in formulating their own China policy regardless of what their presidents or the country wanted.<br />The structure of the book focuses on the back and forth, love and hate, approach to China that has characterized US policy for 20 years. Behind this contradiction lies competing visions of where China is going, which Mann describes well.	2002-07-18

As much as was made of Gore's loss in his home state in 2000, this books makes clear that any democrat would likely have lost there.<br />The first chapter gives a regional overview and each succeeding chapter covers one state, written by a local expert. Highly recommended.	2002-07-02

At the same time, there is a lot of misunderstanding about why a particular election in Taiwan has the results it does.<br />This book looks at local and national elections, with detailed breakdowns on campaign strategy of the parties involved.<br />The book has been criticized by some for its reliance on English-language papers (located in Taiwan), but anyone familiar with the Chinese-language media there will tell you that this doesn't necessarily detract from the book. The Chinese media in Taiwan is so brazenly unprofessional and so heavily influenced by one political party or another, I would honestly think less of the book if it had relied on Chinese media sources.<br />All in all, it's a useful work that belongs in the library of any Taiwan specialist.	2002-07-01

It shows the effects of a minor blow all the way up to a fatal one, though I don't think most fighters have the control to render a pre-chosen level of injury. Nevertheless, the book is interesting and well researched.	2002-06-21

So often, even good scholarship on Chinese social, political, and economic policy is described on a grand, macro scale.<br />Chen Village shows how CCP policies since 1949 transformed the lives of one village's inhabitants, making those policies infinitely more understandable. It's one thing to study the Cultural Revolution, for example, but to see how it shaped and even destroyed the social and community fabric of one group of people is more revealing than any other approach I have seen. Chen village does it with clear writing and expert scholarship, and I can't recommend it enough to specialist or generalist alike.	2002-06-14

Rather than describing how to tie a Royal Coachman, for example, she organizes her chapters into fly parts and materials. So, there's a chapter on duck wings, a chapter on bucktail wings, etc. As a result, you can look at any pattern and figure out how to tie each part, regardless of whether you've tied the pattern before.<br />She also has hints on how to manipulate the thread or other materials to get a stronger and more lasting fly.

This includes how it deals with the western media, its relationship with overseas Chinese communities, and its struggles to be noticed in the face of western favoritism towards mainland China.<br />I can say from personal experience that this book pretty accurately describes Taiwan's approach to these issues, and if you're looking for a good introduction to this obscure topic, this book is a good place to start.	2002-06-14

It's an aspect of the war that war historians don't pay much attention to but it's incredibly important.

The book is at once informative and extremely moving, and I finished it in one reading. I highly recommend it.	2002-06-12

This isn't to say that Lincoln was not worthy of his reputation, and the book does not aim to strip away the respect so many have for him. The information is simply presented in a matter-of-fact way that shows Lincoln was not perfect but tried to do the best he could within the limits of his world view.<br />All in all, this book is insightful, well researched, and a good place for expert or novice to get a feel for what made President Lincoln tick.	2002-05-09

It describes the history of the fish from a regional perspective, explaining why, for example, the fishing in New York is the way it is and how amazing America's brookie rivers once were. After reading it, I had a new perspective on American history.<br />Karas provides ample attention to how environmental problems have damaged the quality of brookie rivers as well.<br />One thing a reader should be aware of, however, is that the book is light on tactics for actually catching brookies. It's much more about why the fish is in the state it's in and what it used to be before man ruined the brookie's habitat.<br />Nevertheless, I was so engrossed in the history provided and the beautiful photos that I didn't mind not getting out of the book what originally inspired me to buy it--how to catch brookies. I've read the book twice and enjoyed it each time.	2002-04-19

It gives an expert, reasonable assessment of the problems of today's media, including the negative effects of corporate ownership of news organizations and how such ownership weakens coverage.<br />There's plenty of optimism, however. I was surprised to learn how profitable news CAN be while remaining informative and balanced. The authors also assess how technology has weakened news coverage but how it also holds the potential to make covering world events easier and better.<br />The book also gives an engaging look at how a newspaper reporter identifies, researches, and puts together a story in a way that reads like a novel.<br />Overall, it's informative, smoothly written, and thought-provoking.	2002-04-18

If Sept. 11 didn't drive that little lesson home, I don't know what will.<br />It was fascinating to see how the lay of the land shapes a region's history and even the attitudes of its residents.

What he discovers is disturbing, but convincing. He understands political and historical theory enough to evaluate them intelligently, but is not a slave to them--especially when they reflect nothing that he sees in his extensive travels.<br />The future world he paints is bleak: the dissolution of political borders, harsh environmental conditions worsening human conflict (a connection ignored in standard studies), and the dominance of human nature that historians often ignore in their search for clinical, abstract models for international relations. <br />Nevertheless, the facts of history have proven him right more often than not and he thus deserves to be listened to. As important is his belief that such a history is probable but not inevitable. Humans have it in their power to get their acts together and prevent such calamity, and Kaplan maintains an odd respect for the world and some hope for its potential.<br />\\"The Coming Anarchy\\" is a thought-provoking analysis that challenges conventional wisdom which, almost without exception, is never accurate in retrospect. Highly recommended.	2002-02-25

Many self-defense books advertise this &quot;real world&quot; approach, but &quot;Put 'em Down&quot; actually delivers.<br />It's short but packed with information. Not a word wasted.	2002-01-30

The reader gets the &quot;feel&quot; of the pilots' experience flying these dangerous missions and offers interesting details about flights over China that aren't covered nearly as much by other works on the subject. <br />Peebles has always been one of the best writers on intelligence matters, in my opinion, and Shadow Flights is no exception. It's definitely worth the read.	2002-01-18

More importantly, Mosher details why this view of China has persisted with a balanced and careful analysis that traces the roots of American views of China. <br />Readers will come away knowing that criticizing the necrotic thugs who rule China doesn't constitute &quot;anti-Chinese&quot; racism and doesn't make them a conservative crank (I'm a democrat). For too long, critics of our China policy have been labelled ignorant and lacking the exclusive understanding of China's &quot;uniqueness&quot; that Holbrooke-types claim to possess. <br />An important work that deserves a look and that has been vindicated by China's recent behavior. Of course, all that will change after WTO, I'm sure someone is saying in Washington right now...	2002-01-16

The research is well done. Despite occasional one-sentence editorials revealing the authors views on his subject, he remains detached enough not to get in the way. Some critics &quot;can't decide&quot; if he's pro or con, but I see that as a strength rather than a weakness.<br />The book also includes information, disturbing information, that if correct should change how history has recently judged the Eisenhower administration. <br />The last chapter is a little dry, however, offering an overly-detailed description of the NSA campus that isn't relevant or interesting. But, overall, Body of Secrets is worth the effort.	2002-01-16

Characters are cardboard vehicles of the action, nothing more. Clancy gets lost in describing the forensic details of every machine the characters go near, from fuel capacity to maximum range, regardless of whether they're relevant to the story. It's hard to bore me with a tale of espionage, international intrigue, and military adventure, but Clancy has done it. See the movie instead (rare advice). It has the depth and flow that the book lacks.	2002-01-16
US	52069345	R4R72FR2LHGOG	0425081621	694137922	Casino Royale	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Great, Moody Adventure	Normally a spy novel is the quickest to end up on the bargain pile, since it's relevant to the political times it was written in. Times change, and the book often loses its appeal. Casino Royale, on the other hand, is as gripping now as it ever was in the Cold War. Fleming captured the feel of those dark days with vivid description and a break-neck pace. It's dark and not what a Bond-film enthusiast would expect, but worth reading. The torture scene is a classic.	2002-01-15

However, the action moves right along with more characterization than many of Fleming's other novels. We see more of Bond's London life and get more sense of who he is. The ending is a surprise, the action's good, and the prose tight. Great for a long train ride.	2002-01-15
US	52069345	R2HWBMW1XTML6B	068485743X	934544519	The First Five Pages: A Writer's Guide To Staying Out of the Rejection Pile	Books	1	53	69	N	Y	Not What You Think It Is	The First Five Pages does give some insight into how quickly agents and editors will toss a manuscript. It was much more about clear writing than anything else, though, and if the author is right about how little time editors spend looking at the text, good writing wouldn't help either. She cites an example of a man who submitted a Pulitzer-prize winning book in manuscript form--every publisher rejected it. So, editing according to her guidelines will do little to get you published.<br />Incredibly, the author makes no mention of queries or proposal letters; only complete manuscripts. As I understand it, agents and editors almost never accept manuscripts before proposals, so regardless of how good your manuscript is, it will be tossed before it's even looked at. This is a bizarre oversight from someone who is supposedly an industry insider.<br />The emphasis on tight writing is appropriate, but there are other books that succeed here where The First Five Pages fails: Joseph M. Williams \\"Style: Toward Clarity and Grace,\\" which is the best book I've ever seen on the subject.<br />In short, \\"The First Five Pages\\" doesn't seem like the kind of book that should have made it past the editors.	2002-01-15

Unfortunately, he spends far more time on them than on the plague. I found myself forgetting what the book was about in the first place. Yes, he argues, these areas were directly affected by the disease. But the ways in which they were affected have already been covered in other studies and Cantor's offers no new insights. Even regarding the material he does cover, Frederick F. Cartwright's \\"Disease and History\\" is more comprehensive and interesting.<br />He spends way too much time tracing intellectual trends that were cut short at the time of the plague which, his argument is, would have started much earlier were it not for the delay (Renaissance thought, for example). This may or may not be the case, but the hard connection isn't really made convincingly and there isn't much info on the biology of the virus either.<br />It almost seems Cantor wanted to write about something else but was required, for some reason, to relate it to the plague in any way he could. Either way, I didn't get what I hoped from \\"In the Wake of the Plague.\\"	2002-01-15

How the leaders interact in the descriptions is also consistent with past studies (including very respected ones), as is the process of policymaking in Beijing. <br />The main value of the book is to get a &quot;feel&quot; for how political decisions are made in China. It's silly to &quot;blast&quot; the book as unreliable, since that's impossible to confirm in any case. The entire study of Soviet and now Chinese politics is based on educated guesses and observation. I didn't get the impression that the authors insist it be accepted as the final word on the subject.	2002-01-15

Provides a good range of weapons defenses, from blades to handguns, and is quite comprehensive for its size.	2002-01-14

It's thicker than the other Fleming novels, but so rich in detail and description that even the most impatient reader will cruise right along. It also shows how cookie-cutter boring modern thriller writers have become. Nobody writes like Ian Fleming.	2002-01-14

That is, he tends to repeat how China is opening and liberalizing toward a more \\"democratic\\" China, as he calls it (a dubious prediction to those of us in the China studies field). A look at CNN archives of his reports makes this very clear. The criticisms he makes are in the area of human rights abuses and political repression, which doesn't make one anti-China. Facts are facts, [...]--the world's not out to get you. I suppose ANY critical reporting of China makes one anti-China, right? Maybe we should only report happy, smiling Chinese faces. Chill.	2001-07-13

However, Dr. Sodaro's excellent book shows how these ties influence the whole continent and constitute a foundation of the events we see today. It's clearly written and a real treasure for specialist or generalist alike. Highly recommended!	2000-10-23

Overly generalized platitudes and a complete lack of depth are characteristic, and are embarassingly clear in his recent coverage of North Korea which has contained no more hard news than what I could find in my hometown library. This is also the case with this book, which feeds the reader the standard, cookie-cutter CNN view of what's going on in China. It's over-simplified and hardly justifies an entire book. I also found bizarre his description of how he felt when returning to Tiananmen Square--nostalgic. I don't think I would feel nostalgic when returning to a spot where the slaughter of innocent people took place. If you want to understand China, buy a real book.	2000-10-20
