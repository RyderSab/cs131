We live in the times of crime and punishment on the level of modernity, determining the fairness of TV rights for inmates, etc. How unbelievably different our world. Not pleasant, the thought of imprisonment in the modern world, but how bizarre in comparison to 18th century English times. <br /> <br />This excellent read of Sian Rees presents another page in women's history studies as the reader becomes a part of the voyage of the \\"Lady Julian\\" in her job as a convict transport ship to the New South Wales (Australia) colony from July 1789 to June 1790.  <br /> <br />Rees' title hints at a much more licentious atmosphere than the book's contents actually reveal. Instead, a very harsh world of English \\"justice\\" for crimes of theft and mugging result in penalties of transportation to a world of most primitive norms. Early chapters dwell on the circumstances of the women and their male cohorts who are caught and sent to jail (gaol) and then tried and sentenced to no less than seven years, sometimes life, and often burning. All those documented details impress the severity of English life on a modern reader who is more accustomed to a diversity of laws, appeals, stays, sentences. <br /> <br />Once Rees' tale puts the \\"Lady Julian\\" at sea, the book becomes decidedly more interesting. Rees obviously understands the workings of ships of the 18th century and provides the most factual of details concerning life aboard such a vessel, including the most basic of human needs: food, shelter, procreation, bodily functions. It is clear that a bonding between sailors and convicts was inevitable and accepted, and that the Puritanical considerations that might have governed communities on land did not hold or cause concern while at sea. In fact, the pairing of seaman, officers, and \\"wives\\" produced a hierarchal status during the extra long voyage.  <br /> <br />Interestingly, the brothel itself did not enter into being until the ship made port, and then it provided commerce for its prisoners that an uninitiated reader might have found enlightening. Most important was the order of maintenance and cleanliness that was adhered to and the wonder that the convicts who arrived in Botany Bay at the future port of Sydney, Australia, actually were in better health than when they left England. <br /> <br />This story frames a part of the history of the fatal shore, the beginnings of Anglo immigration to the Down Under. It is a pivotal read in understanding how a \\"civilized nation\\" dispensed with its \\"human garbage\\" and created a new nation in the offing. As a student of women's studies, this is a must read in 18th century history. <br />.	2004-09-14
US	50685026	R27RPOHD4KPVPT	0439442346	35627963	In the Shadow of the Ark	Books	5	36	39	N	N	A book of Biblical proportions	I discovered this Provoost novel at the Wal-Mart here in the Hill Country and was shocked to see it salted into the romance titles.  But after reading it, I guess that the romance element is central. <br /> <br />Yes, this is a shade of Anita Diamant's \\"Red Tent\\" and there is even a red tent in the story line, the tent of the Builder, i.e. Noach, and his sons and their entourage.  And there is a touch of Tracy Chevalier here, as Provoost takes license in creating a story line around the famous creation of the ark.  As Chevalier creates stories around works of art, Provoost creates the primitive and stark reality that must have surrounded the mythic tale of Noah fulfilling his command to Jehovah God. <br /> <br />The forbidden love story that runs the length of the novel, the attachment of Ham, Noah's youngest son, to ReJan, the marsh dweller's daughter, is key to the larger-than-life tale.  There is almost a Jean Auel quality to this story.  For how can anyone truly know how things must have been during those early Biblical days, much less during the times of cave dwelling man? <br /> <br />Curious behavior includes the reverence of Noah for his \\"shaman\\" messenger in the guise of a dwarf, who sees into the future of the sinful tribes of man and forecasts the doom of the Unnamable's flood.  How equally curious is the paralyzed and beautifully naked mother (who \\"talks\\" with her one good eye) of ReJan who so skillfully controls both ReJan and her father, the master ship builder who aides Noah and his myriad workers in the ark's construction.  There is an air of mysticism that parallel's any early civilization's relation to nature and the powers that govern the success and failure of man versus the elements.  The very magic of ReJan's grooming hands which clean and groom the weary bodies of Noah's sons, with special oils and water, hold hypnotic sway over the bodies of the Rrattika, the wandering tribes who have accepted the task of being chosen to survive the flood's doom.  There is power in this girl and her small family who leaves the marshes for the quarry land of rocks and dust, the site of the almighty shipbuilding. <br /> <br />Not being chosen for one of the ark's saved occupants makes ReJan's family's life even more stressful.  And the intrigue of being desired, actually loved by Ham, against his father and brother's commands, adds tension to the plot line.  With the advent of even more complex ties to Ham's chosen wife, and to the best divined spring water, ReJan becomes not just the forbidden but the necessarily desired, the most valuable of the unchosen.  Ham risks almost everything to have her with him, even the process of special hidey hole building within the massive ship, executed by none other than ReJan's father. <br /> <br />Suspense builds and Provoost almost overwhelms the reader with the detail of the actual loading of the ark with all the animal species which have fled to the quarry location.  And as the ark fills and the rains come down, the massive destruction and brutality of exclusion of the mobs of people who have believed themselves to be included in the ship's roster is excruciating to read.  The agonies of riding in that great vessel, so filled with penned up animal and human flesh and battered without by the most spectacular of natural disasters are vividly executed by Provoost. Nieuwenhuizen's translation of the Dutch text lacks nothing in making the English language reader feel saturated in the doom of this madman's journey.   <br /> <br />The women of this novel are the strong, diverse and colorful characters, to say the least, but the animal-like behavior of all the people, even in their determination to follow their god is fascinating.  This book certainly presents another view of this ancient saga.  And I am glad I found the book, bought it, read it, and, thereby, chose not to miss the boat.  I do recommend this novel and will look for Provoost's other novels that have been translated into English.  I truly look forward to her \\"The Rose and the Swine\\" which has yet to be made readable for the likes of me.  Its synopsis on Provoost's web cite is intriguing.  <br />	2004-08-22

Here is an age old story of a love triangle embedded within a searing friendship. To read this little tome is to sit down with age, two old men, once supposed best of friends, to review their lives and close a forty-one year gap. The darkness of the story's setting echoes in the revelation of the great secret of why these men parted ways. Their survival of very different pasts only accentuates the agony of a connection lost, and then found. No happily ever after here! But there is resolution as time is nearly at an end for both men's lives.  <br />  <br /> This book has the feeling of a European tale of old, and remarkably it has been suppressed for more years than the gap between friends. Markai wrote and published the original in 1942. But his persecution by the Communists in his native Hungary included the repression of his work. Luckily it was resurrected in the late 1980's.  <br />  <br /> Embers, while often painfully slow, as the friends reveal endless detail of their forty-one years apart, glows with revenge and suspense, a red-hot and dangerous fire left by a horrible abandonment of the General by the faithless Konrad. This is Old World fiction worth perusing in the 21st century.	2004-07-25

And what a rogue he is, indeed, and ever more likely to gain a place in a confidence game of the worst sort, confeiting, no less.  What fun to venture across England and into Wales and Scotland with this upper middle class scoundrel and hear his adventures &quot;in his own words&quot;.  Sort of made me think of Henry Fielding's Tom Jones character, and some the the delicious characters of Dickens' own creations as well.  I am currently immersed in catching up on my Wilkie Collins' reads and highly recommend that other readers do the same.	2004-07-06

Weaver, his pseudonym, earns his keep by seeking out and bringing to justice the criminals who trespass on the wealthy, while regaining the treasures of the wealthy for a price.  His &quot;trade&quot; parallels that of a most corrupt pre-police enforcer, Jonathan Wild.  And Weaver finds himself rival, on a small scale, to Wild's organization.  This set-up alone threatens Weaver's very life, but he seems to thrive on adversity, and utilizes his unlikely friendship with a Welsh surgeon to survive the underground powers.  It is when he becomes further immersed into his past, indeed the life and family he has rejected as a young man, that Weaver's greatest adventure begins, as he faces the conflicts of a man's roots, namely his Jewish foundations, while seeking to solve a mystery about stock trading in those early market days.  <br />Liss' understanding of financial dealings makes this very hefty and informative tale a tool of education as well as entertainment.  He defty employs a fast moving, high action plot to seduce the reader into what might seem dry and boring, the financial trading scene, imbuing it all with an aura of intrigue.  Surely anyone who has studied the trade disasters of modern day stock exchanges can identify with the excitement and confusion of the 1719 trade market.  A lesson in economics awaits the reader, as well as a grand adventure.<br />Highly recommend!	2004-06-22

I absolutely love these Alexander McCall Smith creations:  the Botswanan Precious Ramotswe and her fiance J.L.B. Maketoni, Mma Makutsi, and the orphan farm mistress.  They are like friends who I visit in Smith's series.  But I do believe this latest entry to be the least in his writing talents.  I sadly found myself straying from the read and not as interested in the story line.  Although the same cleverness is there, especially in the solution to Maketoni's promised fund-raising parachute jump, I kept wanting to know how all the marriage candidates for the rich hairdresser who employs Mma Ramotswe will match up.  And the solution to the choice comes most unexpectedly only a part of the way into the investigation.<br />Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this visit.  But I hope that with a future entry, I will rekindle my enthusiasm for the series.	2004-06-22

I must admit, I read it through and found the book club members curious and Californian to the core, if that is a fair stereotyping by me.  But I guess I was expecting more to HAPPEN.  This is a plotless book, or very nearly so, with Jane Austen's work as the hook.  I wonder.<br />Being in a book club of five women and one man, not a Grigg at all, I thought I might discover some parallels in our discussions with those of the JABC fictional group.  I guess that their wandering off the subject fits ours.  And I suppose we could be accused of the same social loyalities.  <br />Clearly this novel is not really about Austen, although Fowler includes plenty of Austen info in the epilogue-like would-be scholarly final pages, and I can't quite decide why it is so HOT!  Maybe I need to discuss it with my own book club and find some feedback.	2004-06-22

Not deep, but a relaxing, quick beach read, or anything to keep one at a relaxed, cool, summertime state.<br />Picked this one up at The Dollar Tree on the chance that I would like it, and I did.<br />Now, I will enjoy Kate Grilley's other little books in the series, again as nice little escapes.  <br />Must admit that her book makes me long to tour St. Croix, where I understand that the author lives and writes.  <br />Nice set up this, running a classical music station in fictional St. Chris, hobnobbing with the island locals around lots of cooling island drinks.  Kelly Ryan can't be very old to imbibe so much and still know what she's doing.  Nice connections to the community, the colonial heritage and the tourist trade.  Very nice connections to the island &quot;royalty&quot; of elderly Miss Lucinda, once the love of the Prince of Wales, or David.  And so nice to know the remaining Danish citizen, Miss Maude, the retired island school teacher, the revered link to the coming visit of the Queen and King of the Danes.<br />I do recommend this little escape and if you can find it at a bargain, so much the better, eh, Mama?	2004-06-21

I had no idea that thru-hiking really did not mean that one just STAYED at it, on the trail.  Naive, I guess, but this little read accomplishes so much for the non-hiker like me.  I am amazed at the accomodations both on and off the trail and the sub-culture that supports it.  And I am also amazed to learn of the trail's creation.  I thought it was a historic foot path of trade.  Well, Bryson certainly informed me and entertained me as well.  Great non-fiction read, full of laughs and reality checks about thru-hiking.  I guess I am less in awe of the hikers.  Just releaved to know they are real people.<br />Highly recommend!	2004-06-21

I was surprised that this slim volume could explain so much about the founding of the King Ranch and the controversy surrounding its ownership.  I was especially interested in the property rights of the missing character, a military cohort and investor of King's whose heirs later sued the King heirs for their ancestor's part of the ranch.  All unsuccessfully, of course.  <br />However, this work by Don Graham, whose work I often read in &quot;Texas Monthly Magazine&quot;, which centers more on Kleberg than on the later years and workings, is quite interesting.  I couldn't put it down until the end.  And after yakking it up to my husband, he finally indulged himself in the read.  We both recommend it for anyone fascinated by the legends of this gigantic property and its landlords.	2004-05-05

I was amazed at the intolerance and fear that Americans, Texans in particular, had of their fellow citizens who were of German extract during WWI.  What a phenomena fear is!  And war brings out the worst of fears, even today.  To read of Will, Janice's ancestor and his trial related to supposed treason against the U. S. is an amazing read, as it is based on the truth of the trial of Woods Windle's kin.  <br />I was also fascinated by Will's involvement with the labor movement in Colorado and the Wobblies, and how that branded his reputation, threatened his livelihood as a mailman and upright citizen who saw a need for change and put his life on the line.<br />I am a devout fan of Janice Woods Windle's three books.  Actually &quot;True Women&quot; convinced me that she was a writer to watch.  &quot;Hill Country&quot; was okay, but &quot;Will's War&quot; is right up there with &quot;True Women.&quot;  This is a must read in historical fiction of Texas, circa WWI and its surrounding years.<br />Highly recommend!	2004-05-05

I will never forget my enthusiasm in reading this novel of Janice Woods Windle.  And that enthusiasm led me to recommend it a dozen times over, and to buy copies for friends and relatives.  I just think it is one of the most incredible reads of historical fiction of Texas that has been written.  <br />Don't let the racy paperback cover mislead you.  This is not a bodice buster.  It is BETTER than that, as Woods Windle's connection to Texas' early days of settlement through the fight for freedom from Mexico to those as a young republic and finally a part of the United States are just terrific.<br />Related from Windle's own family tree, the original hardbound copy contains photos of her own family's women in the front and back end pages of the cover.  While reading, it is a joy to thumb back and forth to match the faces to the characters in the story.<br />The courage of these women on the Runaway Scrape, against the area's Indians, in maintaining home and hearth while their men tended to the business of warfare, both for independence and the War between the States, or of cattle drives, or trade, that courage makes them just unforgettable.<br />This is one of my all time favorite reads.  I can't recommend it anymore highly than to say, I would read it again and give it as a gift even today.	2004-05-05

I absolutely loved this book, as it was much more than the title belies.  In fact, I was amazed at the creative choice of titles that this Freesia Court set of neighbors chose to read.  And, I found it fascinating that each hostess went all out in decor and food that was tied to the read.  <br />Best of all is the closeness, the friendship of this circle of reading friends.  Typical of Lorna Landvik, there is humor, but lots of poignant moments as well.<br />Truthfully,  I felt I was in the midst of another set of friends akin to a novel by Lee Smith, Haywood Smith, Fannie Flagg, Nancy Turner, Nanci Kincaid, Rebecca Wells.<br />But that is just okay!  Sometimes it is just a joy to relax with a set of folks that seem familiar, because they exhibit the love we hope for everyone, through thick and thin.<br />This is a fine escapist read.

Because I just knew Lucy was &quot;walking on eggshells&quot; in her life in 1960's Florida.<br />First of all, Nanci Kincaid does know the South.  She has lived it and it shows in her books, especially this coming of age story of Lucy Conyers and her family.<br />And Nanci Kincaid understands the life of a child of divorce, or really abandonment.  Lucy's life, that of the stepdaughter of a noble Southern man, Walter, a man who has clear cut prejudices and no softening on the issues, is a story of the way things were for Southeners of the time of the Civil Rights struggle.  But most important in this little novel of love across racial boundaries is the simple fact that the folks of the South did not always participate in the BIG picture that the TV histories show.  The era of marches and murders and bombings and sit-ins doesn't quite reach Lucy and her family.  But the line between black and whites is there, even though Lucy's family has a good life in their simple home at the end of California Street, just on the line of immediate next-door-neighbors who are the forbidden black lowlifes of the town.  <br />Of course, such a statement is an oversimplification of the relationship of Lucy's family with Melvina and Old Alfonso Williams and their children.  For in the real world of those times, white and black performed a social dance that made things appear like they could not really care for one another or enter into one another's lives, but in truth, they were very much meshed together.  <br />Yet the line was there.  Lucy's beautiful mom, a clearly non-prejudiced white woman, is rescued and loved by Walter.  And she owes him the loyalty of a woman who doesn't cross the racial line, although she does, by writing a letter to the editor of the local newspaper defending civil rights.Lucy knows that Skippy is forbidden to her, but she can't help her heart.  And it is that forbidden relationship that eventually whirls the world of California Street into tragedy.  <br />This is a beautiful little story, one that even Henry Louis Gates, Jr., the noted black writer who is married to a white woman, says that black readers can enjoy.<br />I am not black, but I believe this story could have happened.  And it reminds me of the tone one finds in &quot;The Secret Life of Bees&quot;.  Nanci Kincaid is an author I do recommend.	2004-04-25

I have read this book twice now, and both times, I found it just fascinating to consider the two blue-eyed geniuses that Larson uses as the center of this non-fiction book that reads like historical fiction.<br />I am so impressed with Larson's journalist's flair for telling a story that is the truth, for weaving the human part of history into the revelation of events long since ended.<br />It is amazing to learn about the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 and to feel as if you know Daniel Hudson Burnham personally.  It is amazing to realize the talents of Frederick Law Olmsted, Charles McKim, Louis Sullivan and the transformation that these architects were able to pull off for a show of only six months duration.<br />I feel as if I have lived in Chicago and its environs of 1893 and marveled at The White City in a truly reverent manner, as I have learned the overwhelming details of its conception, installation and reign.  <br />Just as mesmerizing as the fair, with its high ideals, magic and majesty, the blue-eyed devil that is H. H. Holmes fascinates me with his amoral serial evil.  (And we think horror only occurs in these &quot;end of times&quot; days of the 21st Century.)  Larson's juxtapositioning of the two stories: Burnham and the Fair's with Holmes and his dementia, makes it evident that as mankind creates, he also destroys, for good and for evil,  and that there is a replication of such deeds throughout man's existence on earth.<br />I was fascinated by Larson's online interview's on the Powell's Books website and through other Google sources.  And I was delighted to unearth great pictures from the time of the Fair/Columbia Exposition online as well.  Then I ventured to the online pages about Daniel Burnham.  Just wonderful extension's of Larson's excellent book!<br />I loved &quot;Isaac's Storm&quot; by Larson, and want to find his other books and read them as well.  He is obviously an avid researcher and lover of what is stranger than fiction:  TRUTH.	2004-04-25

Their common thread is having husbands flying for the 68th bomber wing, and that they are military wives in a foreign land.  Their social life brings them together, even though life will force them apart in distance and social rank as the story moves over the next 40 years.<br />I was confused about the Future Homemakers of America title, but by novel's end, the meaning rang true as the five women's lives tied back to Peggy and Betty's lives in Texas, near San Antonio where they grew up. <br />This is the second novel I have read in recent months that has revolved around the genetic horror of an inherited disease, Huntington's Chorea.  And I was fascinated at Laurie Graham's plot links from unfaithful Lois's affair with odd John Pharoah, the English odd-ball brother of Kath, who becomes Peggy's dearest of friends.  <br />The devotion of these women over the years through widowhood, remarriage, divorce, cancer, ambition and true friendship is worth the read.  <br />I especially enjoyed the humorous episodes of Peggy's in her wedding and then party planning business.  And her association with her dear business partner, a younger man, who is gay, is delightful.<br />Apparently incorporating a gay character is a trait of Laurie Graham's novels.  And the reality of that incorporation is that many women find their best friendships to be with gay men.<br />There is a feel of a Maeve Binchy read in this Laurie Graham book.	2004-04-25

Is it one of the most readable books I have ever read?<br />A resounding triple &quot;YES&quot;!!!<br />I purchased this book and thought, &quot;Oh well, only a dollar, and looks like it is at least worth that.&quot;  Then I browsed through the photos once I got it home.  And on the third day of ownership, I began reading the Keno saga, a non-fiction journey of avid treasure hunters from their youth in the countryside of New England where they grew up, to their professional work in the world of Americana antiques.<br />These guys are versatile with a capital &quot;V&quot; and with the help of Joan Barzilay Freund, they have put together a wonderful set of chaptered adventures that each center on a separate discovery of very special Americana antiques. <br />Freund is the author of a book on the collection of Americana furniture of Mr. and Mrs. Adolph Henry Meyer; so she obviously knows her stuff.  The Townsend desk from the Meyer collection is featured in one of the Keno book chapters.<br />This is just plain good reading.  And without intending to do so, I am swept into the education they afford me as the reader who learns from eager teachers, lovers of their work of discovery.  The same élan one sees in Leigh and Leslie on TV pours out of these pages in their own voices.  <br />Certainly I have loved seeing Leigh and Leslie on &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; and on their own PBS series, &quot;Find!&quot;  The gentlemanly enthusiasm of these brothers is infectious and makes me feel like I might just make a great discovery in my antiquing adventures, too.  <br />Whether or not I do, I have certainly loved reading their book and highly recommend it to any reader.  Without intending to, you will be swept along into the Keno brothers' lives and inadvertently learn a lot about the glorious craftsmanship of American cabinetmakers and the surviving products of their hands.<br />What an exciting read!

Bored and browsing the Sam's book aisle, I reluctantly picked up the trade paperback copies of Sarah Bird's titles, &quot;Alamo House&quot; and &quot;The Mommy Club&quot;, gave in and bought them, but I didn't open them.  Just shelved them for that &quot;mood hits me&quot; time.  I guess I didn't think Sarah Bird's writing was up the level I wanted at the time.<br />Well, after a rather serious and great non-fiction read, I went to the shelves and pulled out &quot;Alamo House&quot; and pulled an all-nighter reading this tome.  It was like Animal House (the SUKs, appropriate name, eh?) meets the weirdo scholarly dames.  And it was/is fun and funny and poignant.  <br />I am so glad I met these women and entered into their lives and lived a bit of fictional/autobiographical Bird history of University of Texas Austin, circa the '80's.  I will now grab hold of &quot;The Mommy Club&quot; and find the other Bird reads to indulge myself in her clever storytelling.<br />In addition, I will recommend this read to my fellow book clubbers and to my sister Red Hatters, especially those that loved &quot;Ya-ya Sisterhood&quot;.<br />I especially enjoyed reading Sarah Bird's &quot;Conversation with the Author&quot; at the book's end.  <br />Do yourself a favor and remember the Alamo in this version!  No need to go to the movies yet.  <br />But wouldn't this book make a fun movie, though?	2004-04-25

US	50685026	RTRPDGOIQYIDL	0375409440	311140684	Love	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Nothing like a Morrison to make you think	Such a fine line exists between love and hate, and from the start of this newest Morrison tome, we know hate, envy, jealousy, greed, dementia, all synonymous with the deviations of love, or love that shows tints of more than the ideal.  No orange blossoms and happily ever after here.  More like the realisms of those who &quot;love&quot; a man who is more or less lovable.  A man with shades of all the heroic characteristics of tragedies of the Greeks and on and on.  A man with feet of clay.  <br />A rather mad persona meets the reader head on in the italicized words of mysterious recollection, the words of L.  And who is this ancient voice, a survivor like in the jibberish of &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot;, a woman or a man, or does it matter?<br />Each layer of life surrounding the material leavings of Bill Cosey and his once sumptuous sea side palace reeks of decay and greed, of elderly rivalry for that which remains of a vibrant life for vacationing blacks who were segregated from white extravagances.  For with Cosey's hotel and its surroundings, the segregated blacks found solace and society and full out fun, separate and above what was denied them by the white world.  But once civil rights began to make appreciable inroads for them, the blacks no longer needed Cosey's world and it all too soon began a decline that would lead to its end.<br />Cosey's women, wives, daughters, step-daughters, servants, all vied for his endorsement, and finally for his hidden wealth.  And it is their battle for his &quot;things&quot; after his death that both drive them apart and bring them together in violent plotting and insane disassembling.<br />The reader comes to realize that even with their intense hatred of one another, there is an old love from childhood that glues the rivals to one another.  And only in death is the struggle relieved.  Cosey may be the center of a female tirade, but his death doesn't end his domination of them.  <br />The psychosis of love is truly defined inthis character study of Morrison's.  Brava!	2004-02-24

The joy of a good read includes a plot that is realistic, but escapist, and something new to learn.  And Albert accomplishes all this with &quot;Indigo Dying&quot;.  She not only educates the reader as to natural dyes with the emphasis on the special relationship of indigo in mankind's history, but she explores a very real situation of the decline of small communities and the overpowering influence of corporate moneys.<br />China Bayles has come a long way by this 11th volume of Albert's mysteries.  And the devoted fan has learned a lot about herbs, of which Albert is well-versed indeed.  China's struggle to find her own way as a business woman separate from her high-pressure days as a Houston attorney is well past.  And she has a comfortable life with a successful business and partnership with Ruby, the New Age shop owner, and marriage with the former homicide cop, now university professor, McQuaid.  She is settled into a way of life that should be free of the drama of murder, but it is not.  And as she and Ruby head to the tiny burg of Indigo, Texas for an October festival to peddle their wares, she and her cohorts come face to face with very real conflict and dead bodies.<br />The character development central to this story is decently thorough and nicely ties in old friends from China's college days to her present life.  The new acquaintances, all part of her new life as an herbalist and business woman, certainly reflect the diversity of Texans who are seeking better lives away from the large cities.  And China's very real feelings about her stepson also reflect the extended families that are common place today.<br />One of the nice things about China's experiences is that she is so completely involved in living.  And it is just great to enjoy her recipes and relationships, including the suspenseful elements of bringing the &quot;bad&quot; guys to justice.  As a Texan, I find her fictional trails set among the real places of today's Texas very believable.  Good reading.  Can't wait to read &quot;Dilly of a Death.&quot;	2004-02-24
US	50685026	R6CG7XSY4Z0O	0425188140	987439916	Bloodroot (China Bayles Mystery)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Roots rooted in mystery and blood lines	The importance of your ancestry is never more solidly touted than when it comes to discovering what genetic ailments one might have passed on to his or her progeny.  And thus, Aunt Tullie's ailment, the curse of Huntington's chorea, comes head on to both China Bayles and her estranged mother.  And part of the poignancy of this mystery is China's forced link to her mother and her Mississippi heritage, something China has set aside in her adult life.<br />The strong female role that epitomizes China Bayles life in each of the novels Albert has written of her is now exposed at its roots, and we see a strong and successful female who precedes China and her mother in Aunt Tullie.  But with each discovery of what really ails her aunt, China and her mother both have to face the likelihood that they will both face a similar fate, fighting a disease for which there is no known cure, a decline to death that brings on a tortuous end.  The reader can't help but hope that part of the mystery will be solved and that there will be some reason why China will not inherit this fate.<br />With China displaced from her usual Texas base, she is not the business woman we usually encounter.  Instead, she is the guest of her past and must face the close and haunting memories of her childhood, which come to her in dreams of vignettes played out in the moonlit grounds of her ancestor's home.  <br />This is a good ol' Southern set mystery, not as violent as a James Lee Burke tale but nicely eerie.  And the departure from the Texas setting is not disconcerting at all.  &quot;Bloodroot&quot; just enriches the reader's understanding of China, who will appear in several more volumes of Albert's imaginings.  Fun reading, suspenseful and poignant with good food in all the right places.	2004-02-24
US	50685026	R13FIYY8BGSDYC	0233976019	998608800	Out of This Century: Confessions of an Art Addict	Books	3	4	6	N	N	Life with the rich and decadent	I was intrigued to learn that the lead character, Poppy, of Laurie Graham's \\"The Great Husband Hunt\\" was based on none other than Peggy Guggenheim. And liking the fictional account, I worked through amazon.com to obtain Guggenheim's autobiography. <BR>This is like visiting with a very self-absorbed woman, worldly and amazingly stupid in the realm of her rights to not be abused. She is victim to her own acceptance of licentious living and drunken behavior, as her first husband Lawrence Vail, batters her on a too regular basis. Peggy, a daughter of privilege, an American Jew, is one of three sisters. And her most greatly beloved sister, Benita is dead too young, though a young adult, before Peggy can fully reconnect with her. Peggy is a mystery to me:  A wealthy woman who succumbs to her husband's wishes in many ways, and yet seems to ask for the brutal assaults on her person. She is not at all concerned about her moral behavior. Her personal lust for life and any man, often an artist, is blatant. I am not trying to place Puritan values on her; after all, she lived well and long, into her '80's. But she did sacrifice a possible conventional lifestyle for one in which she had numerous liaisons with Bohemian life across Europe. She was miraculously saved from being confined to a German concentration camp, but was eager to return to Europe and live amidst the dangers of German invasion and occupation. <BR>In this giant mix, Peggy accumulates art, modern art, drastic, avant garde works, and amasses a collection that makes her famous. Because of her last name, she is possibly best connected to the collections of her uncle Solomon, who had Frank Lloyd Wright design and execute the construction of the famous Guggenheim Museum in New York City. And, indeed, her collection is now housed there, rather than in her beloved Venice, where she lived out her final years. <BR>This volume, \\"Out of this Century\\" changes its tone dramatically when it ends the lively personal chatter of the first 320 pages, which were published in 1946. With the final 64 pages, the reader becomes acquainted with the older Peggy, now past 80 years of age, and her narrative is preoccupied with her listing of her travels and her life in her beloved palazzo in Venice, a living museum. <BR>The photos and prints of art included in the book give life to the people who seem to be \\"characters\\". Peggy Guggenheim's addiction to art is almost a sideline to her addiction to the Bohemian lifestyle that she indulged in at the highest level her money could buy. She did experience a life of wealth, but was subject to the control of men even though she paid their way. What a strange life she knew. But she did indeed foster the work of many renown artists of the modern movement. And that was a passion for her that went beyond her sexual encounters with the artists and their circle. <BR>Peggy Guggenheim was certainly not the conventional woman of home and hearth of her time period. To say that she was completely selfish and self-absorbed would be unfair, as she did help many people with her money. But she was no philanthropic giantess. <BR>If you are fascinated by the lives of the rich and famous, although you may never have heard of Peggy Guggenheim, you will enjoy learning about her in her own words. Do not confuse her with the museum her uncle's money built, however, for she considered it to look like a parking garage with ramps for its patrons to view the works therein at a postage stamp distance. However, she did finally house her collection there, after her own death.	2004-02-12

Thank heaven for the Kroger display as I dashed in for milk and juice Sunday night!<br />I read John Royal's positive review in &quot;The Houston Chronicle&quot; and went to reading.  And I did love the reading.  But this is not Grisham's best book EVER.  This is a good read, comforting as the meals protagonist Willie Traynor laps up on Miss Callie's porch in Clanton, Mississippi's Lowtown.  And the suspense of a murder trial in 1970's Clanton, the town of Grisham's first dynamite novel, &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;, does give it a great tone.<br />Best of all it is a story of the little Southern town and its citizens as presented by the small town newspaper owner, a &quot;northerner from Memphis and Syracuse University&quot;.  And it is the best of worlds for Willie as he develops a style and a presence as a very important cog, though an outsider, in the wheel of progress that has come to Clanton during his journalist's career. He takes on the persona of a real character as he accepts a gentleman's attire complete with bow tie not unlike Tom Wolfe or Willie Morris, real writers/journalists of our times, who one can picture as inhabiting a Clanton and breaking into the industry in just such a way as fictional Willie Traynor.<br />His cohorts and co-workers are colorful and familiar.  And though a modern times tale, there is the feel of the town of &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; with Harper Lee's characters placed into more modern days.  The evil folks still terrorize others, but the good folks stand for truth and justice.<br />I was amazed at the overt bravery of Willie Traynor.  I guess one has to credit it to youth and testosterone and the guidance of a skillful veteran writer who drives his main character into difficult situations.<br />I was moved to tears near the end, and found that Grisham is still able to connect to my emotions.  I recommend this book for a good winter read.  Grisham has produced another tomethat is worthy of the good folks of the South.	2004-02-12
US	50685026	R11DBMM5GXQLP3	0385334532	280819000	Balls: A Novel	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Any current/former football fan/wife should appreciate this	Wow, Nanci Kincaid understands the scene of a naive-in-love coach's wife.  And having been such a wife for nearly twenty years, I clearly see myself, my former spouse, our coaching staffs and teams and players in Kincaid's storyline.  <br />This is my second Kincaid read, having started with \\"Verbena\\". Having liked it, I was surprised upon perusing amazon.com to find \\"Balls\\", and its summary enticed me to order it.  I read it in two days.  <br />The first person narrative as told by the women of the story, with Dixie as the principle story teller, makes the reader feel at home, as if listening to the story in video clips, a sort of oral history documentary.<br />Experiencing Dixie's maturation from a privileged only child status to the unswervingly loyal, and mostly inept, bride to the veteran wife who maintains her life and her children in the absence of her workaholic coach husband is very touching.  It is obvious that Dixie's life mirrors the lives of many women who marry for love, and end up always being second best in their husband's lives, the lives of men who place their career first and foremost.  <br />I found it especially ironic when Lilly, the family maid and mother of super successful professional football player, Jett,  described the world of coaches and football players as being that of men who never really grow up.  That is so true!  It is a big business beyond a naive fan's understanding.  <br />Living in a football state, having sons who never measured up to the athleticism of their coach father's fondest dreams for them, I clearly understand the emptiness of the life Dixie lives in \\"Balls\\".  No matter how much she maintains her coach's wife status with dignity and support, her union with Mac Gibbs is a shell, a guise, a front for the public and her children.  <br />I especially loved Dixie's devotion to her Christian ways, including huge donations to Unity Prayer, but found great pleasure in her development as a writer and her refusal to further fabricate the Christian legend of her warrior husband coach.  The only thing Dixie did not succumb to was the use of the zodiac to help her husband's team win.  And of that, even I was guilty while living the life of a coach's wife.<br />There is warmth and humor and some earnest Southern culture in \\"Balls\\" and the legendary importance of high school and college sports is right on track.  The men, black and white, are not dark, despicable characters, no more than their women are shrews.  The integration of the races in athletics is important in this story and the place of football as a stepping stone from poverty to wealth underlies the larger cultural issue.  There are shades of moral turpitude being addressed, not just clear cut sanctimonious preachings.  In other words, the story is very real.<br />Kincaid's work is not as polished as it may become, but this is a good start in her writer's portfolio.  All coaches' wives should read this novel, if they can stand it.	2004-02-12

James mystery is comforting.  For, not only is there going to be a crime and its solution, there is going to be a fine set of characters with whom the reader can become acquainted, another extension of Dalgliesh and his staff of detectives, and another set of privileged people who give in to their basic instincts of greed.<br />The Dupayne museum and the siblings who own it are just one set of complicating characters.  For not only do these three have their personal differences and hang-ups, the sets of people who surround and service them espouse equally human needs at various levels.  Even the most menial worker, is fleshed out in a full character development. <br />The suspense is there, even beyond the classic red herring found, and there is a very human tying up of loose ends for the noble Dalgliesh.<br />I especially liked the stalwart character of Ms. Clutton, the museum's maid, the onsite resident who faces each horror with remarkable strength and dignity, not unlike that which I suppose P. D. James might herself possess.  Very strong, very British, mature and able to see the joy in a simple routine existence.<br />One of the positive features of a P. D. James' book is her ability to integrate modern times into her work. These people are definitely a part of the real world of today's London, with its technological wizardry. But they also reflect the moral questions that currently infringe themselves upon modern life, whether they be subjects of child abuse, sexual licentiousness, poverty, parental discord, or dysfunction period, these folks represent the times of James' present world, not a simpler time of Agatha Christie. <BR>Simply put, I do recommend this book. Just the skill of James' literary style is refreshing. Her expertise in using just the right word continues to glean my admiration. Well done! Well read!	2004-01-30

What a charming character, this Big Fish of a dad is!  And such a set of schtick and tricks are here, with a hint of Mel Brooks, Sholem Aleichem, Carl Reiner, Danny DeVito echoing through the delivery of lines like, &quot;I'm dying here!&quot;  One has to be totally calloused to not chuckle out load.  Shades of &quot;Princess Bride&quot; and all the other great mythology of filmdom!  No wonder this Daniel Wallace tale has been translated to cinema.  And I will enjoy the movie version more since I have read the novel base.<br />It is hard to believe that this father is merely an Alabaman, from Ashland, no less.  The twists and turns of his story are much more universal than the modern world.  In fact, the father's adventures seem more like tales from the old country, wherever that may have been.<br />Read it and lift your winter spirits.

US	50685026	R3R2KS0NM2BEKK	0446691321	156214122	The Great Husband Hunt	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Don't be misled by the cover	This is not a romance!  The title and photo on the cover could mislead you.  But this is a clever book, a marvelous character read.  And I loved it.  I think Laurie Graham has captured the ultimate eccentric spirit in Poppy, who is modeled somewhat on Peggy Guggenheim, according to Graham's interview at the end of the novel.  (By-the-way, author Graham now resides in Venice, the home of the Peggy Guggenheim Museum.)<br />I am reminded of the Mitford novels and biographies, not Jan Karon, but Nancy Mitford, i. e. Love in a Cold Climate, The Pursuit of Love, Don't Tell Alfred.  And of the Five Sisters:  The Langhornes of Virginia.  There is even a taste of the absurditiy of AbFab of BBC TV.<br />For certainly Poppy has genuine feelings, as expressed by her loss of her father and the confusion over his double life, and she belabors her having been controlled by her mother and her aunt.  But she is a strong and willful rich woman, a mustard heiress who seems to have no sense of conventional behavior at all, especially as it concerns her daughters, or husbands.  She buys her way through life, but it isn't all despicable.  In fact, her ways as an avant garde originator/fashion designer, and discover and seller of art, are not so foreign to those who actually fill that world even today.  Witness the emergence of design of all kinds in the world of cable TV channels and realize what entertainment value it must provide to not only stay on the air but multiply and clone itself into more and more programming.<br />There is a definite message in this journey the reader takes with Poppy at the helm, and it is the importance of one's family after all.  In addition there is a sense of history, as in the effect of world events on culture.  But the humor and oddity in the story line keep this from being a maudlin tale.  The whole set of characters is no more eccentric than any other good novel, often a Southern tale.  But the mix of Jewish and Christian culture with the art world and the world of the wealthy makes for a fun read.  Poppy is an addictive flower of a protagonist, both reprehensible and sympathetic.	2004-01-16
US	50685026	RXJHDPDKI5QAK	0525947671	7966085	The Lady and the Unicorn	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Chevalier weaves a goodie	Tracy Chevalier loves the arts and history and has presented another volume of very readable fiction, as told by the characters themselves.  This is Chevalier's finesse, 1st person narrative, and getting involved with Nicolas des Innocents, the miniaturist who becomes the originating artist for this famous tapestry series, is an intimate way to learn what Chevalier imagines to be their story.<br />I especially enjoy 1st person stories and as Chevalier alternates characters and their individual version, she once again weaves a good tale.  There is a marvelous sense of the world of commissioned art, art for propaganda's sake.  And Jean Le Viste, the powerful right hand man of the King of France, represents all the power brokers of history who seek further self-glorification by the display of their \\"priceless things\\".<br />It was fascinating living among the Brussels weavers and coming to understand the magnitude of their task.  One almost feels their physical discomfort and certainly the realities of a labor intensive craft.  Having studied the importance of weavers throughout history, I was especially pleased to see Chevalier's casting of the guild system that controlled the work of Georges, Christine, their son, and workers, as well as their blind daughter, Alienor.  <br />The cad that Nicolas appears to be mellows within a short time, but his impact on all the lives of those who implement the lady tapestries is fascinating.  There are lovely ironies in all the secrets that Nicolas causes to finally be exposed.  Especially nice is Chevalier's epilogue which ties up the loose ends, just as the weavers finished off their work.<br />Very clever, this Chevalier woman.  Wonder which historical period she will novelize next?  I shall be waiting with her other fans.<br />The hardback edition of this book is simply beautiful with its blue dust jacket that cuts away to reveal tapestry glimpses, when just under it lies the glory of a full color display.  What a special delivery!  It makes a lovely presentation worthy of the value of the original works themselves.	2004-01-14

Well, I must concur that this the third of the Berrybender Narratives may not be the best of the three, but I still find the farcical characters and the historical characters who are woven throughout all three books memorable and generally fun.  I guess you can't top Lonesome Dove in some folks eyes, but I will remember Tasmin and her scout husband for a long time as they are larger than life, just like the whole crew that travels those primitive 1830's Indian &quot;infested&quot; trails of the Berrybender entourage's pilgrimmage.<br />If western fiction that contains larger than life situations and dilemmas fascinates you, this McMurtry is a suitable final installation for you.  If you like to read books in a series, you must read this one to finish off this set.<br />Again, there are gorey parts and reprehensible actions by fantastical inhumane seeming humans.  But there is also solid entertainment. Dispel the winter doldrums and polish off a great writer's latest effort.	2004-01-13

Woven around the patronage of Dublin's fine restaurant, Quentin's, one gets to know its managers even more closely, as well as the character of would-be documentarian, Ella Brady.  In fact, this tale tells more about Ella and her parents and their part in the scandalous investment schemes of a dodgy investment whiz, an adultrous man with a wife and a continental flair, and a duplicitous nature, all used for self gain.  <br />The reacquaintance with folks from Binchy's earlier reads, &quot;Tara Road&quot;, &quot;Scarlet Feather&quot;, &quot;Evening Class&quot;, imparts a good neighbor feeling about characters who reappear in yet another modern Binchy tome.<br />Reading a Binchy novel is a bit over the shoulder nosey, as the reader becomes privy to pieces of many lives other than the main character, and the threads of all the lives add to the richness of a feeling of community in the greater story.  This is typical Maeve Binchy, whose books I have enjoyed since reading &quot;The Copper Beech&quot;, &quot;A Circle of Friends&quot;, &quot;The Lilac Bus&quot;, and &quot;Light a Penny Candle&quot;.  Binchy brings her stories into an up-to-date focus, yet flavors them with plenty of Irish panache.  These are not books with earth-shaking consequences, but they are enjoyable, escapist reads.  Quite satisfying for a time away from the very disjointed and noisy world of technology that occupies so much of our lives today.	2004-01-06
US	50685026	RG8UPSSTN54WW	0743249887	641047904	Welcome to Higby: A Novel	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Visit to Mississippi town mirrors a Texasville visit of yore	The brevity of chapter length in Mark Dunn's Southern comedy entices the reader to keep reading.  Yes, the character names are contrived and ridiculous, but no more than other authors have penned in their comic tales.  In fact, this tale of the citizens of Higby, Mississippi, mirrors the bizarre cast of Larry McMurtry's ribald \\"Texasville\\", and of the humor of the movies \\"Daddy's Dyin': Whose Got the Will?\\", \\"Home Fries\\", ad nauseum.<br />But I liked it enough to read on.  Perhaps I was wondering how Dunn's plot might parallel T. R. Pearson's \\"A Short History of a Small Place\\", what with the town water tower serving as the start and end of the Higby visit.<br />The characters in this tale are richly eccentric and colorful to match their names.  Dunn had fun with these names:  Carmen Valentine, Harold and Carold, the Pedloe twins, Klaus and Abbadene Ostermeyer, Stewie, Tie, Ponce, Talitha, Bowmar, and more.  And the reader is reminded of the cleverness of Dickens and Twain in their naming of casts of characters.<br />Dunn's playwright's talent definitely influences his novel.  He has a way of setting up scenes that might be vividly played out on stage or on screen.  And with the humorous situations into which he places his cast, one also sees the pathos of real life, the true basis of humor, a deep sorrow of the valleys of life, not just the high points.<br />Each character, starting with a grieving teenaged boy named Clint Cullen, a preacher's son, no less, and a love-starved maker of potato salad, virginal Carmen Valentine, is likeable and believable.  In fact, you may swear that you know some of these people.  Dunn skillfully manages his \\"cast of thousands\\" by weaving them into one another's lives, just as small towns tend to do to their citizens.<br />I do recommend this book.  It is a nice escape from TV and its laugh track sit-coms and over-done reality series.  And you will find laugh-out-loud moments, good for what ails you during winter doldrums.	2004-01-06

And the woeful tale of this set of characters is subject to yet another version of the American saga which presents one more twist of the knife in the heart of humanity.  <br />How could a black man, a former slave, bought out of slavery by his formerly slave parents, an only and most prized son, emulate his former slave owner and become a master of his own race, a slave owner?  <br />Well it happened.  And this story originates in Virginia with interjected references to the descendants of its characters who will finally live in freedom and make an in-road into the leadership of coming generations.<br />If anyone has read the works of Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, David Bradley, John Edgar Wideman, they know of the many other voices of the black man's story in America.  And if one reads Edward Jones and becomes fascinated by his revelations, let me advise you that his skills replicate those of other black authors also of this time who have written before him.<br />In fact, for all his notice in the world of literature, Jones is not the writer that his predecessors who still live and write are.  His writing is rather disjointed in comparison.   <br />But if Jones' work and subject matter so move you, springboard from this book, if it is pivotal to you, and read Wideman, Bradley, Morrison, Walker, and saturate yourself in an even greater understanding of the legacy of slavery in this nation now in its 21st century.<br />Truly, while reading Jones' work, even the start of Moses' time in the wilderness, a private and sensual freedom from his Master's control, recalls to mind the stories found in Walker's \\"Meridian\\" and Morrison's \\"Song of Solomon\\" with the rich tribal mysticism of those African slaves so recently from another continent.  Those characters, too, isolate themselves into the wilds and seek rejoinder with their African past, in most primitive expressions not unlike that which Moses executes and his fellow slaves witness in secret.  <br />Most poignant in this novel, of course, is the shocking reality of the continued brutality to the black freeman, who once free, having labored long to buy his way out of slavery, is subject to the whim of roving speculators, those scum of the underworld who trade in human flesh beyond the hand of justice.  <br />The ironical death of the black slave master, Henry Townsend, and the quandry into which his educated wife Caldonia is thrown seems so unlikely.  But one has only to remember the blue vein society of blacks who \\"passed\\" and their stories of class systems against their own race as revealed in the short stories of Charles W. Chestnutt, particularly the story, \\"The Wife of His Youth\\", to realize that Henry Townsend's widow and her upper crust friends lack the strength of character to free their slaves; their people and their weakness is only human, though inhumane.  <br />The corruption of owning others is copied by Henry Townsend who eventually lives free, but remains as the best friend and surrogate son of his former white master, William Robbins.  He rejects the example of his own flesh, his father Augustus, and enters into the money-making proposition of owning those of his own race so as to prosper and reach a gentleman's status, as high as he can go in the ranks of free blacks.<br />Henry's first slave, Moses'plan to seduce the grieving Caldonia and come to be the surviving master, shows his personal deception.  He has been a slave, the foreman of the Townsend slaves, and believes he can rise out of his slave ranks to those of master via marriage.  Another fool he, another dupe to the wicked deception that is integral to slavery.<br />There is a powerfully tragic tale to be told in these pages.  Don't let them be the last that you read about this subject.  Read the works of other black writers of our time and LEARN.	2004-01-06

With the voice of Lou, actually Imo's niece,  aiding the recollection of the story, one visits the life of a most unusual family of farm folk with a head of household old enough to be a grandmother, not mother, and a down home association that is strictly green thumb Baptist goodness.<br />Interestingly enough, Imogene, called Imo, is the hot ticket for the other ladies of Euharlee, Georgia, to find a fella for and match her off in as fast order as possible.  To soothe her grief after a 48-year marriage, Imo is encouraged to try all the modern means of meeting a new man, including the big city grocery market version of singles clubs.  Of course, those ways are artificial for Imo, and she has troubles enough, what with rebellious teen hormones thriving in her daughter Jeanette who is entangled in an illicit relationship with the immigrant Dairy Queen manager.  In addition,Lou stubbornly seeks to waylay any serious attempts Imo may make toward courtship, as she faithfully clings to the memory of Uncle Silas, now deceased.<br />Within the plotline of contrived courtship and a potential of at least three would-be mates, Imo and her girls manage to produce bumper crops of fresh vegetables to feed the poor of Eurharlee, particularly tomatoes.  And a reader who loves fresh vegetables will find the descriptions of vine-ripened fruit too tempting.<br />What author Cannon is creating in this tale of alternated telling:  one chapter third person, the next a journal version of Lou's, is the start of a series of books about Imo and her crew.  For the next volume entitled 'Mater Biscuit is due in March of 2004.<br />If you need a light read with some laugh-out-loud characters and situations, particularly those involving the hard of hearing Fenton Mabry, this bookis for you.  If you are always longing for a small town read redolent of the charms of Jan Karon's Mitford series, or Fannie Flagg's Alabama and Missouri tales, this book will amuse you.  We all know that there are 65-year-old women who head up households after being widowed or divorced, and the next book in the series presents the introduction of yet another female of the family, the 84-year-old mother of Imo who is coming to live with her and her crew.  The span of generations is growing in the Lavender farm house.  Could lead to fun, maybe even a film version.	2004-01-06

I found his treatment of Caroline's story to be sweet, as in the title, but not saccharine.  And the admiration I already had for her has been upped by this biography.  I feel sure that this is purely unauthorized.  But it does not scandalize Caroline.  And, although I am certain it further violates her privacy, I feel that Andersen's work ennobles Caroline as the lone survivor of the Camelot family.<br />Perhaps it is because I am an inveterate reader of People that I found Andersen's style so readable.  But I really did want to keep reading.  And not all biographies are so enticing.  Of course, there is the lure of trying find out another scoop on one of the chosen Kennedy clan.  But I honestly find this volume on Caroline to be uplifting, although I know that there are things yet to be known about her.  Time will tell about the rest of her life, yet a young life in the scheme of things.  One just hopes that she not only survives her family's tragedies, but that she and her spouse and children and their progeny prosper and continue to use their wealth to enrich not only themselves, but this nation.  Brava!	2004-01-06
US	50685026	R1YFWX3NZIDKTJ	B0000C37E7	373279179	City of Dreams: A Novel of Nieuw Amsterdam and Early Manhattan	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Rivalry of healing arts juxtaposed in Old Nieuw Yorke	Thanks to The Dollar Tree, I picked up this hardcover volume for a mere $1.00.  I got much more than a dollar's worth, what with this roaring tale full of sex and gore, based on the early times of New York: from its time as New Amsterdam, through to its early independence immediately following the Revolutionary War.  <br />Such a saga set in early New York, Nieuw Amsterdam, the tale of the Turner siblings: Lucas and Sally, details their journey to a new world and their ambitions to make their fortune while facing torrid torments and rich surprises which lead from the time of the unwed siblings to the generations of their progeny.  Their one time partnership ends bitterly when Lucas settles for money over blood, and the future of their offspring continues in a bittersweet rivalry, masking the true kinship of the original Turners. Each generation reflects the original severing of familly ties, without their full understanding of their integral links to one another.<br />If you like a progressive tale of historical fiction that centers on the healing arts, this book is for you.  For with Swerling's novel, one is placed on the spot with the butcher who becomes the barber who becomes the surgeon: the outcast healer who seeks to heal using the skills of the scalpel.  This trail of medicine men meets its direct opposite in the work of the trained physicians, those who use the purges, blood-letting and cupping techniques to cure their patients' ailments. Both sets of healers often kill rather than cure.  But between the two ironical representatives of the heirs of Lucas and Sally Turner, are the apothecaries, the herbalists, those who seek natural ways to eliminate pain and restore health.<br />There is a fascinating history here of early colonial and Revolutionary life as well.  The political ramifications of those who hold power and those who wish to hold it are explicit.  And the characterizations of those who trade in illicit arms, goods, gaming and prostitution are vivid and sympathetic.  This is a story of epic proportion and I am glad I had it to read this winter time.  It is definitely X-rated in gore and sex.  But it works!<br />I have loved the other historical fiction novels of New York I have read that include \\"Forever\\" by Pete Hamill, \\"The Alienist\\" by Caleb Carr, and the progressive mysteries of MaanMeyers, aka Annette Myers: \\"The Dutchman\\", \\"The Dutchman's Dilemma\\", \\"The Kingsbridge Plot\\", \\"The High Constable\\" and the works of E. L. Doctorow.  This novel by Barbara Swerling joins the others in fleshing out my background in the historical times of Manhattan.  I recommend it!	2004-01-06
US	50685026	RNOIR54F3I43C	0452283205	101423143	Falling Angels: A Novel	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Anglophile female study in grave setting	I was fascinated by this book.  Chevalier's talent at presenting a story line via first person narratives is showcased here with turn of the twentieth century London as its base.  The characters who tell us their stories are sectioned into the years 1901-1910, from the mourning of Queen Victoria to the mourning of King Edward.  And their mostly upper middle class status sets the tone, a little rivalry between families whose grave sites end up side by side.  Interestingly enough, the daughters of these two couples, the Waterhouses and the Colemans, become true friends.  And from their day of first meeting as they gather in the cemetery in remembrance of Victoria, the girls, quite opposite in nature, are drawn to one another, despite their mothers' obvious distance.  <br />The whole plot centers on the trips Maude and Lavinia (Livy) and her little sister Ivy May make to the cemetery.  It is their center of recreation.  And it is there that Jenny, the Coleman maid who escorts them on their excursions, becomes entangled in a life-changing affair, while Maude and Livy become best friends of a most unlikely mate close to their age, Simon Field, the gravedigger's son.  Simon's class rank is so far below that of the girls, of whom Maude's family ranks higher than Livy's, yet he is the best pal of these young girls.  And it is Simon who will go to heroic measures to assist the girls in their hour of greatest need.<br />The psuedo liberation of the upper class' sexual mores is an underlying theme in Kitty Coleman's life.  And it is Kitty who becomes embroiled in the Suffragette movement of upper class women, adding color and suspense to the plot.  <br />Each voice of the various characters rings true to the person speaking, balancing the points of view of several generations and class ranks starting with the very strict and Victorian rank of Mother Edith Coleman, who wishes to control the behavior of her son's wife as well as his household. The spoiled and seemingly lazy Kitty contrasts dramatically with the straight laced Gertrude Waterhouse, who finds Kitty's rank a point of competition, yet who comes to truly mother Kitty's only child, Maude.  For Gertrude is the ultimate modern housewife and mother.  And each woman's \\"At Home\\" days conveniently conflict with one another, therefore eclipsing their chance at real socialization.  On the other hand, with cricket as the draw, their husbands, Albert and Richard, strike up a cursory friendship that deepens with time.<br />As Maude and Livy age, they face the erosion of Maude's family, although when real tragedy strikes they experience a time of growing apart as they mature.  <br />The servant class spokesladies of the Coleman cook, Mrs. Baker, and the housemaid, Jenny Whitby, flesh out the Edwardian times and the life of an upstairs/downstairs relationship.<br />Typical to Chevalier's writing in her other novels, she masterfully builds the tension and suspense that makes the reader want to keep going.  Therefore, this is an easy, fast read.  And I do recommend it, particularly if you like to feel a part of a plot with characters who speak directly to you.	2003-12-12

Although of a rather nice size, this is strictly a visit with the beloved retired rector and his wife and the aging community that is so familiar to Mitford fans.  I did not expect this volume to end up making a startling set of plot outcomes, and it didn't, but I found the whole read comforting.  It was good to go back home to Mitford and follow the seasonal advance on Christmas with surprise presents being prepared for giving.  <br />I am glad that I bought this volume:  a relaxing, restful, reassuring interval in other reading.  I recommend it to those devoted to Karon's wonderful characters.  You will certainly laugh and smile and rejoice in the down-to-earth experiences with all the good folk in Karon's fictional town.<br />This book is Karon's Christmas card to her fans.

US	50685026	R2HVTIWDAHWTKE	0452284449	667500496	The Virgin Blue: A Novel	Books	3	0	1	N	N	This one lacks luster	Having read \\"The Girl With the Pearl Earring\\" a couple of years ago and liking it somewhat, and having talked with a bookseller in Brace's Books of Ponca City, Oklahoma and having heard his endorsement of \\"The Virgin Blue\\", I bit.  I waited until having returned home to buy a discounted copy at the neighborhood Kroger and plunged right in.<br />I was pleased to learn of the plot lines' connection to the \\"Montelliou\\" of my graduate studies and felt this novel, though split between the present and past of an alternating chapter scheme, to have a special interest.  After all the heresy of the Inquisition presented a mysterious time in Europe, and in \\"Virgin Blue\\", the link is with the Huguenot persecution of the late Renaissance in France.  <br />Curiously, American Ella Turner, Tournier by heritage, finds a genealogical mystery at hand with her goal of uncovering her family's past near her very location in the small town of Lisle-sur-Tarn, a mere village.  Typical of the tightness of small town society, and the stereotypical treatment of Americans in France, Ella finds her neighbors to be cold and gossipy, all but the wry, and sexually intriguing librarian, Jean-Paul.  Despite Ella's seemingly content and thriving marriage with her husband Rick, now assigned to work in France, she is lured into the mutual investigation of her forefathers and mothers and into a physical daliance with the stand-offish, yet attractive French researcher.<br />At the same time we learn of Isabelle, the discontent and abused wife of Etienne Tournier, a shepard, whose family inhabited the early times of Moutier, and who adhered to the Calvinist teachings of a wandering cleric, an act of heresy that eventually drove them out of the warmth of their primitive French life into the colder climes of refuge in Switzerland.  All of Isabelle's life is revealed in parallel chapters, yet the presumed connection to Ella, the modern adultress, is so contrived that by book's end, the contrivance is off-putting, to say the least.<br />I do not know quite how Chevalier's writing might have been better, plot-wise, as I was certainly drawn into the mystery of the first two-thirds of the novel.  I kept thinking of the words of the male bookseller who proposed that it was a good read, and wondered why I wasn't so content with the book's final third.  It is certainly romantic and intriguing in that Ella's inability to get pregnant and her disturbing after [intercourse] dreams of a specific virgin blue make for sleeplessness and near despair, driving her out of the known and into the unknown, and thus to life changes that make her less and less sympathetic and more characteristically disturbed.  Perhaps I was too judgmental and just tired of her personal struggle which seemed much less significant when juxtaposed to the personal struggles of Isabelle.<br />Having studied \\"Montellieu\\", I find that \\"The Good Men\\" better represents the period of heretical inquistion in France.  And \\"The Return of Martin Guerre\\" certainly precedes the other writings setting up a nice mystery of its own.  In my opinion, if you are debating whether or not to buy \\"The Virgin Blue\\", leave it to a check out at the local library or a hand-me-down from a friend and fellow reader.	2003-11-14

She is faithful to history, but enlivens it with the intrigue of a stolen ransom from the Welsh, a ranson of Cistercian wool and other valuables that dowager Queen Eleanor needs to send to Germany to purchase the release of her favored son.  Of course, true to history, there is the involvement of Prince John, the younger and more greedy son of Eleanor and Henry II.  But the liscense that Penman uses places John in an intimate relationship with Henry's half-sister, Emma, Queen of the Welsh, and is contrived and predictable.  But it does not lack in suspense and the irony that makes this book a good read.<br />Justin de Quincy is a most sympathetic protagonist, and his youth, wits, bravery, and loyalty gain him admiration.  He is indeed heroic and noble, despite his unrecognized status from his father, a high ranking cleric who has provided for his son but denies him official notice, thus keeping the scandal attached to that revelation at bay.  <br />De Quincy's time in the fictional Chester bishopric and its accompanying location is appropriate for a great story line, a time for his reacquaintance and alliance with his childhood mates, Bennet and Molly.  His sexual relationship with Molly, while natural and realistic, reveals de Quincy's feet of clay, as he is the soon-to-be father of a noble lady's child, the scheming Claudine, a spy for Prince John.  Yet his sins are forgiven him as he nearly misses his own execution by those aligned with a devious plot to steal the riches of the Welsh ransom and provide them to John and his usurper's cause.<br />The characters of Bennet, Molly, Thomas de Caldecott, King Davyd of Wales, Llewellyn ab Iowerth, Angarhard, Rhun, Oliver, Queen Emma, are nice additions to the already recognizable characters of Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, surviving wife of the now deadHenry II, and Durand, her other spy, who also serves her wayward son, Prince John.  Reading Penman is like getting truly acquainted with a set of characters who have been lifted from the pages of history.  And typical to a writer of good historical fiction, Penman always provides a detailed Author's Note with explanations of her writing devices, particularly those employed for a medieval mystery like this one.<br />Now, I must move on to her newer historical novel, Time and Change, also about Eleanor and Henry and their power hungry offspring.  I shall be glad when Penman finishes a fourth de Quincy adventure and readies it for publication.  Such a book makes for a nice escape from the intrigues of the modern world.	2003-11-14
US	50685026	R1U27D0HC3LE8T	0385337477	168107941	Lord John and the Private Matter	Books	5	12	16	N	N	Private Matter indeed, me Lord!	I have tried to read Gabaldon's tomes of great renown, i. e. The Outlander series, and I may yet try again.  But something about this little book in purple on the Sam's Club sales shelf wooed me, much as the small detective series of Sharon Kay Penman's protagonist, Justin de Quincey had lured me into a series of mysteries in the time of Eleanor of Aquitaine.<br />And I just thought I should give this shorter write a try.  I am so glad I did!  For I discovered much more than I thought I would in the pages of Lord John's tale, a story of intrigue befitting the times of the mid-1700's in England and rich with a history of a seamier side of life which directly impacts the lives of Lord John and the other characters.<br />I found Lord John's role in the nobility of his day and its leadership of the English military quite fascinating, especially as it linked itself into the very real underworld of humanity, the scandalous and necessary part of whoring, both male and female, and the varied sexual proclivities that have always been enmeshed in human life.<br />Was I surprised by Lord John's tastes?  Yes!  Was it off-putting?  No!  In fact, his sense of duty to family and his task as an agent of the monarch, indeed his self-knowledge and loyalty to who he really is are quite admirable.  And Gabaldon's skill at keeping me reading, leaving just enough to question, made the novel one I found hard to put down.<br />The other characters in the story, especially the Byrd brothers, Quarry, Stubbs, Olivia and Lord John's mother, the Countess, are colorful enough to make me feel like I would enjoy seeing them again, as is the especially flamboyant Stephan von Namtzen.  Even the villains are sympathetic with a seemingly despicable Trevelyan and his Irish apothecary Scanlon assuming near heroic purpose as the tale unwinds.<br />This little book is quite user friendly.  It feels good in one's hands, and its smaller size, with a less crowded set of words on each page made me feel like Iwas just breezing through it.  Nothing weighty here, though the social and moral questions it presents, which are set in a time of England's war with France, and the tragedies that war brings are weighty indeed.<br />Most wonderful of all is Gabaldon's skill in writing historical fiction with a mystery interwoven.  I really shall look forward to the rest of Lord John's trilogy.  And I will promptly mail my copy of the book to my very dear friend for his enjoyment.  I shall delight in knowing how he views this tale.<br />If you like historical fiction that is on the mark, and you consider yourself a mystery buff, I suggest you spend some time with this private matter as well.  This is mature adult fiction, at its best.	2003-10-25

You will learn of her warts and all, a dysfunctional wife and mother, a sexually abused chld, an alcoholic, an overeater, an intellectual to the max.<br />And if things herein shock you, there is plenty more to delight the mature reader, male or female, as this woman tells all, reveling in her special times as a teacher, especially that time in San Quentin with her prisoner learners.  Her writing institute base of teaching writing is so familiar to any English teacher who might be reading this memoir.  And the revealing stories of her incarcerated students present the most moving segment of the whole book.<br />This woman loves life and just happens to believe in making sure that she participates in it with companions to touch and stroke her needy body.  In conjunction with these intimate encounters comes true enlightment, as she falls in love with New York City, and partakes of special places, including the actual writings of Herman Melville.  She is indomitable, indefatiguable, a woman who does not let her calendar age stop her from really living.  Her independance, not that of a wealthy woman, comes purely from determination.  She is, therefore, an inspiration to those who are aging, the baby boomers who may foolishly wonder whether they should just long for times gone by, or if they should strike out and LIVE!<br />Jane Juska is a brave woman, as she bares her soul and tells all the secrets without disguising them in a work of fiction.  I am glad my best friend from our teen years gave me this book to read and review.	2003-10-12

This is exclusive, initiated society, bred from the high school clique, and the need to have an exclusive circle of friends above marriage, family and greater causes.<br />\\"The Red Hat Club\\" is a gossipy chic book with fantasies of the passion-filled, aged hot babes, all wives and mothers, who maintain a record of comfort in the presence of one another.<br />Talk about a long history of girls' night out!!!  <br />Their loyalty across the irritating quirks of one another is admirable, shades of \\"Ya-Ya Sisterhood\\".  <br />Their success at sharing the wealth of the rich Jewish member is fanciful to the nth degree.  A bit like the novel \\"The Last Girls\\", but these Southern dames are closely linked to their high school, not college, youth, and therein lies the romance and improbability.  <br />Yes, this is fun for those who long for things as they might have been.  But great literature?  Hardly!  <br />If you choose it, as I did (from the sales shelf of SAM's before attending the organizational meeting of a Red Hat Society branch), be forewarned.  This might be a temporary escape, just for the fun of it.  But the truth is, not all Southern women need a club of women to find self-fulfillment.<br />You might wish to save your money to buy a red hat to wear, and just let someone pass this tome to you as a loaner.	2003-10-07

And what a drawing card they are for the Friday night heros of yesteryear in this little town that loved Eddie Rake and the glory years he and the town boys gave.<br />No doubt about it, John Grisham knows his small town football and its frenzied nature.  And he has the old broadcast suspense down to a fine art.  But the whole book smacks of the play and movie done before \\"Bleachers\\"  and the individual tragedies of the former players play out here around the arrival of the latest returning hero, Neely Crenshaw.<br />There is a poignancy in the meeting of long past friends and the reliving of horrors and joys centering around the shrine of a dying Eddie Rake.  There is also the inevitable downfall and set of clay feet, of not just Rake, but Crenshaw, Sol, Jesse.  <br />The wake and the funeral are touching, but Neely's self-revelation as he delivers the third part of ex-players' eulogies of Rake is a bit trumped up and anticlimactic.  Even his meeting with his \\"true love\\" and ex-girlfriend, the one he threw aside for ... Screamer, is a bit disconcerting.<br />But I do find it all quite believable, ...<br />Grisham does capture the truths of obsession over one main sport, an obsession that goes back in time to other sports, other heroes, other times and places.

Everyone should have a family like hers, with Aunt Tempe, Aunt Dell, Uncle Bun, a marvelous Mama and grandparents and cousins and family gatherings around food that will make you want to go to the kitchen to execute one of the cooking delights featured in the tales.<br />I was especially fascinated by the pineapple upside down cake cooked in a cast iron skillet, and macaroni and cheese like I never imagined it.  <br />It also thrilled me to learn that West was a slow-to-learn cook herself, yet the obvious love she has for her family and their food eventually became a part of her own mature life.<br />I think this book would be a fabulous gift to anyone from the South, or anyone who wishes they were.

I liked \\"Crazy Ladies\\" a lot, but this volume, despite its graphic scenes of sex and violence is an artful piece of writing.  There is a lot of talent in West's prose, as her characters seem larger than life, though real.  And, again, this is a novel about strong women and their men, of whom there are MANY feet of clay.<br />The Nepper family, with Vangie, Henry, and Olive, are the core of the book.  Vangie is a poignant woman whose naivete shields her from seeing the truth about her daughter and her husband, but who finally flies the coop and demonstrates her strength when she has had enough.  It is Vangie who keeps the home fires burning, and her flower gardens growing, who assumes her pharmacist husband is the faithful, truthful man she believes she married.  Together Vangie and Henry face the suicidal poisoning of their only child.  Apart, when Henry has violated all the principles of his wedding vows by falling in total lust with DeeDee Robichaux, each meets his own destiny.<br />The town's solidarity around the lone Baptist church sets up the downfall of the hypocritical church leader, the young, and dashing bachelor preacher, Reverend T. C. Kirby, whose personal secrets lurk in the background, as he seduces women of all ages to suit his own devilish whims.<br />The right and wrong social sides of town are made clear, with the tragic Robichaux family living among the outcasts of Hayes Street, and the Neppers, Galliards, Hoopers, and LeGettes residing as neighbors on Cypress Street across from the oxbow of water known as Lake Limoges.  In the fictional Limoges, all streets are either named for U. S. Presidents or for flowers and trees.  <br />Linking all the upper and lower class families together are the children, especially red-haired Billie Robichaux, the enterprising daughter of DeeDee and her miserable Korean War veteran Reney, now a wheel-chair bound paraplegic.  DeeDee's Aunt Butter is their landlord.  Butter, owner of a town eatery, provides a home for the ingrates that are DeeDee and Reney.  She sacrifices her home's sanctity for the drunken destruction of Reney who feeds off the hatred he has for DeeDee, his whoring wife.  Butter is the refuge that Billie deserves, however.  And Billie, in her efforts to survive her poverty and the dysfunction of her parents, finds ways to work for the well-off ladies of Cypress street.<br />Knitting the families of Cypress together is Sophie Donnell, the black maid to Vangie Nepper, Waldean LeGette, Harriet Hooper, and Edith Galliard.  Sophie is the ultimate survivor, as she is the brutally abused wife of Burr, a wife-beater any reader will love to hate.  As a day maid and cook, Sophie, knows the business of all the households, and they in turn wonder why she continues to take Burr's abuse, even sheltering her whenever they can.  She is one of the noble characters of the novel.  <br />Israel, the black mortician's helper at Beaulieu's is another noble character.  As an old bachelor, he does his work taking in the dead to prepare for burial, and lives a solitary life of independent respectability. <br />There is rich humor in this book, some of it laugh out loud in nature, a great comic relief to the rougher scenes.  An especially endearing comic narrative comes from the owner of the town's funeral home, Cab Beaulieu, as he explains his sexual history.  Even more delightful is his encounter with Vangie's sister-in-law, and his neighbor, the widowed older woman, Edith Galliard.  His entanglement with this widow is one he cannot escape. <br />Each part of this novel is laced with the real heart of life in northeastern Louisiana in 1952, the recipes that feed the very soul of the populace.  Those recipes reveal the joy of food, the importance of its sustenance in a story that is rich and calorie laden.<br />Third person chapters are interspersed with first person narratives of the many characters.  In these narratives, West executes exceptional skill.  The voice and dialect of each person according to their race, class, age, is right on the mark.<br />One feels like they have lived four months of 1952 in Limoges, learning its most human secrets, good and evil.  These people of West's fiction are hauntingly real, just like the recipes that they share.	2003-09-04

Set in small town Tennessee from 1932 to 1972, West has her women tell their own story, starting with Gussie Hamilton, continuing with her daughters and grandaughters, and including her &quot;Nigra&quot; maid, Queenie.  This wouldn't be a truly Southern woman's tale without that black voice.<br />There is no &quot;sisterhood&quot; in the sense of Rebecca Well's books, but there is a bloodline of strong and &quot;crazy&quot; women who tell their own version of a story that encompasses all of them as they interact in one anothers' lives. And there is a quirky play of Mother Nature in the town's creek. <br />The men of the story, husbands and sons and lovers, are almost overwhelmed by the women, and by the consequences of war.  From WWII to Vietnam, the men are decimated in spirit and/or body or both.  Sibling and class rivalry condition relationships, and racial prejudice sets an undercurrent of injustice into the subplots.  Small town politics, hypocritical poses, family secrets, all play into the story.  <br />An insecure, less favored, jealous Dorothy lives up to her own expectations, unsuccessfully seeking attention and love her whole life through. Her younger, seemingly chosen sister, Clancy Jane has every reason to find success, but only finds heartbreak.  Their strong center, Gussie, holds the whole group together, despite her own sorrow.  And Queenie, the faithful maid, becomes the lifetime companion to Gussie and her progeny.  Violet and Bitsy elongate the rivalry of their mothers, but maintain an uneasy truce of cousins.<br />Reading this book with its chapters broken into books of each decade, is a bit like hearing gossip, as each character relates her own bias on the happenings of the Hamilton heirs. This is a fast and easy read, like looking over the shoulder of a several diarists who each perceive the story in a most personal way.<br/>And, there is an awful secret in this book, shades of &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot;, &quot;The Bingo Queens of Paradise&quot;, &quot;Paradise&quot;, and &quot;Little Altars&quot;.  But the reader is in on the secret from the start and the suspense comes from waiting to learn how its does or does not unravel at book's end.<br />I have also purchased three other of Micheal Lee West's novels, and I will enjoy trying them out.  I do recommend &quot;Crazy Ladies&quot; to the reader who likes a tale of strong women told in first person narrative.	2003-09-01

But with the location of Paradise, Oklahoma, as the base for Darla Moon's life and times, the novel reminded me more of \\"Where the Heart Is\\" by Billie Letts.<BR>And it is curious to me that Paradise is the choice of town names, reminiscent of Toni Morrison's tome published some time earlier and chosen as an Oprah read in 1998.<br />This is a harsh story line and I really did not like the book very much at first, but I hung in there, and I ended up finding some redeemption in the connections of Darla to Elijah, her crazy Granny's devoted love, and Spirit Jackson, the Australian non-denominational preacher who loves Darla, and in the children of Darla's sister, Rhonda:  Pearl and Jessie.  The absolutely disgraceful dysfunction of the town whore, Roxie Moon, Darla and Rhonda's mother, and the many \\"uncles\\" who flow in and out of Darla's family's life are a real turn off.  And the brutality of Rhonda's drunken husband, Frank Slater, is almost over the top.  But there are heroics in this sordid tale, and certainly Darla Moon, a survivor of poverty, as well as mental, physical, and sexual child abuse, is worth reading about in the long run.  <br />Park's characters include a set of Lesbian fortune tellers, Bingo buddies of the Moon women.  And the acceptance of these women, as well as the black man, Elijah, who provides sustenance and strength to the Moon girls, confirms the value of human life over prejudices and stereotypes.  It is Elijah's sincere reverence of the Bible and God and Jesus, and the above repute strong neighbor, Miss Cissy, who represent true goodness and serve as guideposts and life savers for the Moon girls. The alienation of the Christian community, small though potent in Paradise, reflects the ironical truth about the posers of good, who in fact do evil to those who do not fit into their mold. One is reminded of similar character links in \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" and \\"Mother of Pearl\\", or even some of the work of Alice Walker and Toni Morrison.  The mismatched outcasts of life are central to Darla Moon's story. <br />There are so many similarities to Billie Letts' characters that one might swear that June Park and Billie Letts, both writers from Oklahoma, had collaborated on their stories.  <br />The secret of the flourishing goldenrain tree, the only plant that survives Roxie's touch, the horror of rape and abortion, corrupt law enforcers,  and destructive acts of nature and man do parallel some of Fannie Flagg's writing.  But \\"Bingo Queens does stand on its own with Darla Moon as an unforgettably strong young woman who dreams of designing haute couture and wearing a beautiful blue gown to a Pavorotti concert in New York.<br />This brutal tale is not without hope, and I am glad I finished the book.	2003-09-01

As Mma Ramtoswe feels the pinch economically and emotionally, what with moneys tight in the agency and the illness of her fiance, Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni,she comes to rely on the unexpected talents and strength of her secretary.  Mma Makutsi, with her too dark complexion and too big glasses, a less than &quot;beautiful&quot; specimen, shows true beauty in her no nonsense approach to taking on the business managerial load of Tolkweng Road Speedy Motors and its &quot;lazy, girl crazy apprentices&quot;, as well as landing a big paying client for the detective agency.  Mma Ramotswe doesn't exactly take the back seat, but as she wrestles with the case of depression of her normally steady and reliable Motekoni, she is able to see her secretary's best qualities.  In fact, I found the very modern issue of medical depression quite fascinating, along with Mma Ramotswe's recognition of the need to read about it, and get help from the other strong woman in the series, Mma Potokwane, the director of the children's orphanage who relies on Rra Matekoni for help.<br />This volume of the series was very touching to me, as Precious Ramotswe takes on the case of an obnoxious Governmental Official who wants his own family investigated.  Her wisdom in using the cultural courtesies of Botswana to interview the would be &quot;culprits&quot; and find a solution are just good sense.  Her strength of character reinforces the issue of morality in the story.<br />Most amusing of all is the big money customer that Mma Makutsi obtains who requires  a quick investigation into the character of four Miss Beauty and Integrity of Botswana candidates, a rush job with an unusual need and surprising resolution.<br />Best of all, Mma Makutsi shines in her managerial skills with the mechanics and customers of Speedy Motors, more than succeeding in bringing things in line for the ill owner and his intended bride.  Her personal joy in receiving the opportunity to succeed in the business world makes her unusal character round out into a fully amusing and &quot;beautiful&quot; woman.<br />Mr. J. L. B.'s recuperative visit to the orphanage and connection with a wild child there further enrich his gentleman's character.<br />This is a reassuringly enjoyable read.  A comfort and joy for the fans of Alexander McCall Smith's series.	2003-08-30
US	50685026	R375YYTBOMOSRL	0312201656	477658660	I Capture the Castle	Books	5	3	3	N	N	This book captured me!	My friend recommended the movie, and I went to the web and found its website, which intrigued me into finding a used copy on amazon.com.  I also did investigations into the other writings of Dodie Smith, and was entranced to know that her fame came largely from \\"101 Dalmatians\\".  <br />Well, my trade paperback copy arrived and I immediately plunged into the tale of the crazy family of Cassandra Mortmain, the story teller,  and their state of poverty of the upper class in England.  Actually, it is amazing that her father, James, a one book author now stymied by writer's block, should submit his second wife and three children to such an austere life, one that is supported by the son of a now deceased housekeeper that the family took in during better times.<br />Cassandra's sister, Rose, plots to marry the property's rich owner, which leads one into an examination of the truth of intentions:  money over poverty in the guise of love.  And the seduction of Simon Cotton, landed gentry with American background, gives Cassandra quite a tale to tell.<br />Cassandra is the love object of Stephen, the serving woman's son.  And she dodges his determined suit, though touchingly receiving his gifts.  His dedication to the Mortmains and to Cassandra in particular parallels a knight who serves the damsel in tales of old.  <br />There is remarkable strength in the character of lively Topaz, James Mortmain's second, and much younger, wife.  She truly holds the family together, and the three Mortmain children seem to respect her as a step-mother who is not much older than they.  In fact, the whole Mortmain family is oddity personified; yet, they are deliciously quirky and enjoyable.  The setting of Scoatney Castle and the remains in which they live, horribly cold in winter, lacking light and adequate food, but rich in spring and summer, is as much a character as any of the cast. <br />And the American heirs, the Cottons, contrast with the very English Mortmains in social customs and income.  The lavish circumstances that Rose enjoys with Simon's family once they go to London gives off visions of a lively between-the-wars British society in dazzling costumes of the 1920's and '30's.  <br />I am so glad that I ordered this book.  It kept me reading day and night for a couple of days.  It swept me into Cassandra's world and into a vivid period of her coming of age.  The honesty of its telling made it even more delightful.<br />Now, I am ready to see the movie.  I only hope it holds up to Dodie Smith's original book.  If it fails, I still have my personal vision of the novel to satisfy me.  How nice to discover another lovely read and to be captured by it!	2003-08-28

The respect Mma Ramotswe finds in her interchange with an American woman searching for her long disappeared son, something as simple yet significant as a properly supported handshake, convinces her of the sincerity of the mother's quest.  And, roundabout, for that is the way of Mma, she faces the other complications of her life, including becoming engaged to Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni.  Through the disheartening experience she has with the belligerant and deceitful maid of Matekoni and her surprising discovery that he has adopted two children, one of whom is handicapped, without even discussing the matter, Mma faces her personal challenges while quietly pursuing the leads that finally bring her to a solution.<br />The characters in this second in the series of Precious Ramotswe novels are the key to enjoyment.  The corruptness that she encounters is wisely handled by a traditional African woman of not too many years.  Her interaction with her future husband and his new children, an acceptance and even joy, let the reader understand that she and he have a lot to share and are comfortable in doing so.  (Even though her need for a diamond ring surprised me, she still demonstrated great good sense in the final choice, a ring with a diamond from African soil.)  Their ability to live life to its gentle fullness, in a traditional Botswanan way, brings forth chuckles and smiles and an good-all-over feeling upon completing another book.  Indeed, each book with Precious Ramotswe in it is a gift, like the tears of the giraffe.	2003-08-16

Just travel back to the simpler life of Elmwood Springs, Missouri, and the radio domain of Neighbor Dorothy.  It is the 1940's in a small town of quite beauty with families and neighbors living very normal lives in a time just after WWII.  Neighbor Dorothy is an incredible woman, a center for broadcasts that reach a huge span of listeners in many states.  Her thirty minute broadcast, homespun with reliable sponsors, varied guests, a family of supporters, most especially Mother Smith at the organ, and talent that a world of media junkies might find hard to believe is the hub of the novel.  The cast of thousands over the years draws in a cast of characters that are priceless and real, as the home of Dorothy and Doc, the local pharmacist, their children Anna Lee and Bobby, and their family pets, comes to house even the most desolate of persons.  And the simple acceptance and open arms welcome of the Smith household just seems to be second nature, especially to Dorothy.  One can only imagine how delightful Dorothy's cookies for on-the-air guests and audience members must smell.  That thought alone draws the reader into this wonderful home.<br />Skillfully, Flagg executes her story line in easy-going episodes, developing each character in relation to the others and revealing their personal oddities and endearing traits.  From the gospel singing Oatmans and their retiring Betty Raye, to the in-for-a-meal poultry king, name of Fowler, to Hamm Sparks, the politician and future governor of Missouri, Flagg makes her characters vivid and fun, with potential greatness and feet of clay.  Following these people, and their links to one another, through the decades until the 1990's makes for a pleasant journey with memorable events laced in, and humor at many a turn.  Just thinking of Tot Whooten, Aunt Elner, Norma and Mackey Warren and Cecil Figgs makes me smile.  Just thinking that Neighbor Dorothy has passed on brings a tear to my eye.<br />I have liked reading Fannie Flagg's work for years, starting with &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes...&quot; and going back to &quot;Daisy Fay and the Miracle Man&quot;  and she has never disappointed me.  Flagg makes even the most serious of subjects palatable as she finds humor and delicious irony to provide relief from pain.  No walk of life is &quot;forbotten&quot;; all the diversity of today's world resides in her novels, just more comfortably with the support of a small town acceptance of its own.  Her colorful characters and plot devices make each read memorable and make me hope that she is busy writing yet another novel to share with us all.	2003-08-13

And this is an easy read with the comfort of known characters growing older and progressing as individual women who still find a home and family to be a good center.  The mystery here is not such a big suspenseful draw, just the involvement of the two friends in a possible money-making scheme, ring led by Shelley, with Jane along for the ride, and maybe the profit.  The plot revolves around this would-be job and the unusual, almost all woman crew of renovators who are already on the payroll.  But the vandalism of the site and the one murder take a gentle route to solution.  This is no great puzzler, much less suspenseful horror.  Rather domestic in its scope. <br />Jane's interaction with her children and their maturation, her comfortable relationship with detective Mel, her entry into the real computer age and her developing novel, make for a fast and easy diversion.  <br />This is not the best of Churchill.  In fact, mystery is just coincidental to the plot, it seems.  But I do think it is good enough to divert the mind from the frustrations of the world for a while.	2003-08-13

The graciously gentle and peaceful manner of resolving difficult situations in typical Botswanan style is in direct contrast with the lifestyle of modern America.<br />There is a slow and easy nature to Precious Ramotswe, her fiance, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, and her assistant Mma Makutsi.  But that nature does not preclude initiative and innovation.  For even up against the competition of a chauvinistic new detective agency, Mma Ramotswe maintains her calm and patient demeanor and continues to serve her clients with discretion and wisdom.  For an African woman in her late thirties, she demonstrates inner peace and strength beyond her years.  Her ambitious assistant's new business, a typing school for men held after hours, provides a counter plot which enriches the story line.  In addition, the interwoven staffing of Matekoni's car repair shop with the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, further links Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi with the young mechanics who work for Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni.  This is a true family of characters, including the children of the orphanage on the outskirts of town, from which come Mma Ramotswe's extended family of adopted children.<br />Once again, there is logical conclusion to the predicaments of Precious Ramotswe and her associates.  These gentle twists to the unraveling of the unjust bring a smile to the reader and an appreciation for the beloved culture of these Botswanan natives.  They honor, revere and love their nation home.  And the reader comes to know that reverence in an almost personal way, although vicariously.<br />The love of a natural Africa with a citizenry that prides itself on respect for life, nature and one another, reminds one of the sweeping beauty in the opening shots and lines of the movie, &quot;Out of Africa&quot;.  Smith obviously has the same love of the Dark Continent and its people as did Isak Dinesen/Karen Blixen, whose voice over in the movie says, &quot;I once had a farm in Africa.&quot;  The past that Dinesen revered is the present of Precious Ramotswe.

I opened it a wee bit and shelved it.  And, now, in this summer of recovery of health and cleaning out of books, I read it.  At long last!<br />I was often tired of holding or propping the massive volume up so as to read, but I moved into the 1950-1951 world of the Mehras, Chatterjis, Kahns and Kapoors and stayed for six days and nights, reading, resting, reading, dreaming, becoming one of the flys on the wall.<br />I went back and forth to the internet, searching words, and places, and foods, and people in history.  I learned.  It was not painful; long, but not painful.  And I feel that I will carry this wealth of experience with me and with it an understanding of a world culture I understood only slightly before this reading.<br />Seth truly knows the culture and the politics of India of that time.  He is young, but he did his homework and reflects the intensity of a newly independant nation in its struggle to make a new identity and maintain much of the old.<br />It seemed impossible to me that such a world with so many primitive beliefs and practices could exist side by side with the refinement of education, higher education with a highly Westernized slant.  To realize the importance of education to a world that many people still see as third world even 50 years later, was truly eye-opening.  <br />I started a legal size notepad of terms that I investigated via the internet, something I would have had less success at doing eleven years earlier, and I feel as if I have traveled this summer, not just back in time, but into another world that is strangely unreal, yet full of the same governances as much of Western culture:  democracy, the family, religious practice, sports, moral values.<br />I think I can only imagine how my former Pakistani and Indian students must have reflected on this culture of the United States.  I feel enriched to have lived with Seth's book for so many days and to have gained new respect for the world of India.  <br />This book is thick in politics, in the struggle of various family members to maintain or to gain political power, for the good of India and for themselves.  It is rich in class struggle, above the caste system, into the British system of its former colonial days.  It is a book brimful with Urdu poetry, so foreign to this reader.  It is a novel rich in varied characters, full and real.  The humor and pathos are balanced skillfully, as Mrs Rupa Mehra pursues the search for a suitable boy for her younger daughter, Lata.  And as the reader follows Mrs Mehra's pursuit, he or she also immerses into the world of vibrant India at her national beginning.  <br />What a classic piece of work.  How I wish the Brits would produce it in a mini-series!	2003-06-30

She knows her mythology and literature and hero epics and uses this knowledge to enrich Harry Potter, the fifteen-year-old Hogwarts student and the plot that surrounds him in \\"The Order of the Phoenix\\" with amazing skill.  Too long?  Not really.  For she is working the details of old and new characters into the life of a Harry who is coming of age, whose adolescence is hardly pretty, that of a morbid, moody, enraged young man whom many of us recognize all too vividly as the hormonal youth moving painfully on his way to manhood.  <br />What is the saying?  If anything can get worse, then it probably will?  Or is that Murphy's Law?  Well it does seem to apply here, what with a Dolores Umbridge (and boy does she take umbrage--what a perfect name choice) stirring up the Hogwarts population, professors, students and all, and working in cahoots with Cornelius Fudge and the Death Eaters to fulfill her own power trip.  What a toady woman, indeed!  <br />And Hagrid's turmoil, much more personal as well, sad and almost hopeless, serves to round out his character, from lovable buffoon to caring half-breed.  The bonds of misfits are strong, even when challenged separately.  The bonds of friendship continue and enlarge despite the more adult lives that fill schedules and preclude the delights of younger years.<br />At times, I really disliked Harry, his moodiness and burning scar and all.  But I was amazed at the truthfulness of his portrayal.  Rowling obviously knows the adolescent boy persona.  And she understands the pain of growth and struggle for life that supercede all magically peaceful resolution.  There are many more mysteries here, fittingly linked to the Ministry of Magic's Department of Mysteries.  A very adult tone emerges, not unlike the seriousness of a Tolkien hero.<br />There are so many new characters in the mix in this book, enriching the whole story as they appear.  And the humor is still there, especially in the strength of Professor McGonagall.  What a woman!  One sees Maggie Smith with each scene featuring Minerva.  Just thinking of her is a bright spot.<br />The touching things that come out in this book, the revelations about the Longbottoms, Luna and even the Snape of Harry's father's time, are remarkable. The importance of mixed blood begins to reveal itself as a metaphor for strength and virtue.<br />Best of all, Rowling portrays the intensity of exams, the pettiness of rivalry, the confusion of early romance, the chaos of a school gone out of control, the suspense of rescue, all with the skill of a fine writer.  Her ability to portray the horror of wizard battle is marvelous. And the fine lessons, life's truths, are beyond magic.  Or perhaps they are the finer magic of the series. <br />Yes, this volume was well worth the wait!  Brava, J. K. Rowling!	2003-06-30

I ordered it used via amazon.com and was pleased to find it awaiting me at home one day.  Even more pleasing was to find it was a first edition and autographed.  What a surprise!<br />Reading about this passing-for-white heroine of Alef's, Mary Ellen Price, makes for a nice diversionary look into the world of slavery prior to the Civil War, and the path that a chosen pale child is given out of the slavery of her black skinned mother and peers.  It all seems rather dreamlike.  How did such things really happen?  But, of course, they did.<br />I was fascinated by the courage and fortitude of Mary Ellen and her adept skill at learning enough to make it on her own, once she was granted her emancipation papers.  Her business acumen, and sheer hard work make her most admirable, and her connections to the early movers and shakers of the Gold Rush days of San Francisco are quite skillfully enmeshed.  It is hard to believe that San Francisco, the California's sophisticated bay city could have been so primitive and so rapidly populated and literally filled in to make space for inhabitation.<br />Especially fascinating is the detail of the journey from the U. S. across Panama and finally on steamer to San Francisco.  Unbelievable what people endured to get to the gold fields, all pre-Civil War.  <br />The politics and strategies of the leading characters to ensure themselves of continued land rights and wealth, and to gain leadership positions despite the issue of slavery laws is also intriguing.  What a manipulation took place in those days, beyond what the average person would know.<br />Having read many books on San Francisco's early days, this volume just adds more enrichment to the knowledge already reviewed.  <br />I will be glad to read the second volume of the California Chronicles.  <br />I do not think Alef to be the best of novelists, and the text is not edited all that well, but I enjoyed the read nonetheless and encourage others to read it as well.	2003-06-12

I just kept going trying to find out how the world of a Big Thicket girl could possibly be linked to a Navajo Code Talker. But Turner pulls it off. I was amazed by her accuracy in capturing the racist, backward attitude of an East Texas logging community and its errant teens, as well as the starkly contrasted Navajo community of Gordon Benally and his kin. What a shock that those two worlds met, came together, and struggled to survive! <br />The dysfunction of Frosty Summer's family is almost too much to bear. In fact, I almost thought the tale would never end. Frosty's parents, sisters and friends are so vividly real and cruel and stunted by their culture, rooted in the fundamental Bap-Diss church, that it is hard to understand how she clings to it as she does. But the old adage, \\"blood is thicker than water\\" certainly applies, and the injustices of this WWII world of racial hate are potent.<br />Turner's no chapter style and juxtapositioning of scenes out of the two very foreign cultures of the Thicket and the reservation are rather Faulknerian, yet, there are character names and distinct links. Working the puzzle, reading through and learning how things are connected is worth it. But the truths of racial prejudices, particularly in the first half of the 20th century are here and vivid. <br />To read this over 400 page volume requires a determination to plow through the hard times that both Frosty and Gordon experience. This is mostly Frosty's tale, however, and she is spunky, determined, capable of hard work and a true survivor, one of the tough women of times past, yet near. <br />Having read two of Turner's books, I wonder where her next female protagonist will hail from and how strong she will be. I will be curious, and I do recommend that you try \\"The Water and the Blood\\". It is disconcerting and memorable. <br />What a perfect title!	2003-06-01

If you love reading the words of someone who has lived it, i.e. a diary or journal, you are going to love Sarah Agnes Prine's journal.  The twenty year span goes like lightning, and indeed, you won't want to put it down.  Sarah's story from her adolescence to her widowhood make for great adventure, almost unbelievable, in fact.<br />This is a rich story of a very strong woman, one who can do it all, both because she has to, and because she can.  Sarah is a survivor, to say the least, and the spirited type of pioneer woman who forged the wilds of the West, specifically the Arizona Territories, in the late 1800's, facing life-threatening attacks from Indians, banditos, and evil outlaw thugs, as well as the worst that Mother Nature could deliver.<br />This is a novel, but seems quite real, and Sarah and her romance with Jack Elliott fill the pages with hope and a love of life. Sarah's family and their ventures to settle the untamed territories, involve hard work, hard times, making the best of whatever befalls, and epitomize what people can accomplish with united determination.   <br />Nancy Turner certainly captures the West in vivid detail and makes one feel, that even a full century later, she has lived there for a while.  Turner's first novel is a wonder.  This book should be read and passed on, as its story and characters will certainly be kept in the mind of the reader for a long, long time.	2003-06-01

Henry in this stew	Reading Sandra Dallas novels is like \\"being there\\" in a slice of life of the past.  This is true of each of her previous novels, all of which I have read and recommended to others, and it is true of \\"The Chili Queen\\".  <br />This time, we are immersed in the West of Nalgitas, New Mexico, and in the four main characters, starting with a very tolerant Madame, the Chili Queen herself, Addie.  It is the book on Addie that sets the stage for the whole plot.  For there we learn of homely, worn-out Emma and her abusive brother, John Roby, and we engage Addie's two remaining whores, her customers, and her black servant, Welcome.  Finally, we meet her lover and friend, the outlaw bank robber, Ned Partner.  <br />One gets the idea that Addie's book is just the set up of plot twists to come.  And, not to be disappointed, when Addie's book finishes, and Ned's begins, the reader realizes that the weave of the four main characters' stories gives progression to a subterfuge of schemes, not untypical of an O. Henry short story.<br />This is an enjoyable read, with characters that would translate beautifully to the screen, a la the cast of the modern version \\"Maverick\\" with Jodie Foster, James Garner, and Mel Gibson.  <br />The wit of Dallas' characterization and the situational ironies make for a fast and entertaining read.  It is hard not to jump ahead to the resolution, but worth the wait, no matter what the reader may guess will happen.  <br />\\"The Chili Queen\\" makes for believable and entertaining recreational reading, with suspense, romance, and a sense of the real characters of the later years of the Old West.  I highly recommend this little book.	2003-05-30

As master of the bizarre in characterization, McMurtry takes the mountain men tales of real life characters like a young Kit Carson and laces them around the lives of the fictional English noble, Lord Albany Berrybender and his children and servants, and presents a rousingly good story.  <br />In fact, picking up where \\"Sin Killer\\" left off, this book leads the reader into the next phase of exploration along the Yellowstone River in 1833, with the likes of the son of Sacajawea and his father, a Scots noble, a Dutch botanist, the artist George Catlin, a German prince, and a most unlikely cast of frontiersmen and Indians.  <br />The lustful romance between Tasmin Berrybender and her spouse Jim Snow, the Sin Killer, center the story, but they are just a part of the whole.  There is not a dull character in the lot.  Each Berrybender, and there are still a lot of them remaining, is a unique rounder.  The mountain men live up to their legendary mythos. And the Indian nations exhibit the curious position of those being victimized by the ensuing white man invasion.  Their reactions represent a spectrum of violence, manipulation, and partial coexistence.  But Indians and the beasts of the wild keep the level of suspense ever present.  Even the superstitious belief in the impending doom from sighting a wandering hill, foreshadows the possible danger lurking around each part of the journey. <br />This vivid cast of larger-than-life beings, lives life to the fullest in the most earthy manner, exhibiting quirks that parallel the folks appearing on talk shows of today.  Despite a severely hampered and diminishing physical being, Lord Berrybender commands his entourage on this great \\"safari\\" into the American northwest, as he wastes the virginal plains of its four-legged bounty, and uses up all things of the flesh and of nature to sate his own boundless mania.  <br />One can only imagine this story put to film.  For it would be unforgettable, indeed.  The cast truly rivals those of the earlier \\"Lonesome Dove\\" saga.  And one can hardly wait for McMurtry to publish the third tome of the set.  Excellent adventure, unforgettable characters, fascinating plot.	2003-05-24

Meeting up with Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn is just like meeting up with old friends.  And reading this newest Hillerman brings one quite up-to-date with each of the men, their current love life, and their efforts to solve a mystery of international intrigue.  <br />This is not Hillerman's best novel, but one can forgive him because he does present a fast page turner and educates along the way.  Chee's romantic interest, Bernie Manuelito has gone to work for the Feds in the Border Patrol, and unlikely as it may seem, she becomes linked to a murder in the Four Corners.<br />The pig involved takes on several meanings, but would be especially familiar to anyone in the pipeline trade.  The double meaning, of course, indicates the greed that leads to corruption within governmental bodies.  <br />This tale involves Washington, D. C. subterfuge, and enlists the Navajo Tribal Police,  U. S. Bureau of Land Management, U. S. Border Patrol,  the F. B. I., and the Office of Homeland Security.  Hillerman skillfully sets his tale in the midst of the real world worries of the 21st century.<br />Will \\"third time's charm\\" work for Chee in his stumbling romance with Bernadette?  The romance and the mystery intertwine for a comfortable quick read and satisfying solution.  <br />Can't wait for the next Hillerman in order to meet up Leaphorn and Chee once more.  If you are a Hillerman fan, this is a must read.	2003-05-20

I only knew of Franzen's hostility about his novel being selected by the Oprah Book Club.  I never read his book.  Didn't care to even try, until a young woman friend asked me about it and I thought, \\"Why not now?\\"<br />I am so glad I did!<br />Jonathan Franzen obviously has his finger on the true pulse of an aging population and the grown children who labor with their new responsibility.  As a former member of the \\"sandwich generation\\", whose beloved parents are now gone over six years, I see glimpses of them in Franzen's Enid and Alfred and am amazed.  The pain in this family, the estrangement and dysfunction, is often hysterically funny, JUST LIKE REAL LIFE!  And each grown child's passage into the role of a child parenting parents, having to get along with siblings during the most stressful of times is simply amazing.  <br />I just think that this book is a must read on any modern reading list.  It is certainly modern literature and worth the journey.  Franzen's characters will live with me for a long time and I am grateful that such an amazing writer exists.<br />This is not light stuff, but unbelievably worthwhile.	2003-04-30

(Surely, writer that she is, she has read Galworthy.  Everyone should.) For Nicholas seems just as obsessed with Etna as Soames is with Irene.  Of course, the stilted language that Shreve executes in Nicholas' narrative makes the tale quite a period piece.  But she doesn't have the gift of Galsworthy.<br />Unrequited love, a great universal theme, makes one feel a bit of disgust for Nicholas the smitten professor.  His social status certainly doesn't smack of a Forsyte, but his desire for a governess of pecuniary embarrassment certainly does mimic Soames' obsession with a poor piano teacher, both at the mercy of a dead father's poor estate.<br />I enjoyed Shreve's period piece Fortune Rocks much more than this new tome.  But this book will probably please those who like a good romance with a twist, a Shreve specialty.	2003-04-30

But this one has a different twist in that it is grown women who do the traveling, four of them, once college suitemates, 35 years earlier, and now reunited in a tourist's tour of the great river.  The characters that Smith creates are rich and believable and her obvious understanding of writing genres furthers the development of these would be creative writers in days gone by.  Harriet, Anna, Courtney, and Catherine (and Catherine's hubby Russell) come together to recreate their college days' raft trip and to sprinkle the ashes of their rebellious suitemate, Baby, thus honoring her life.  <br />Each woman's life in relationship to Baby, while in college at Virginia's Mary Scott College, serves as the means for getting to know Baby.  But Smith makes sure that we see the poignancy  in their lives after Mary Scott revealing the women they have become.  <br />This book entices the reader to keep on reading, to unravel the secrets of Baby and her hold on the lives of her surviving friends.  And wonderfully, Smith even sketches out the lives of the women who did not make this second trip in brief summaries at the end of the main story. <br />This novel falls into the category of those good, fast reads about Southern women, a la Fannie Flagg.  What an enjoyable read about women you might just know or might just wish you did!	2003-04-30

No syrupy love this, but a romance of everlasting grace, the story of aged Conrad who so deeply grieves the loss of his Rose, his wife and life's companion, that he would like to die.  Then, early on, Conrad sees the Angel Lemuel, and other mystical things begin to happen which transform his death wish into the rest of his LIFE!  <br />This lovely little story reaffirms the belief that life is to be lived, that a great love need not die, that grief is just another step in life's journey.  And with the graceful story telling style of a Jan Karon, Carrie Brown's first novel, though only discovered a few week's ago by me, becomes a new treasure in this reader's life.  How could someone so young as Carrie Brown imagine the great truths of life?  Well she has; and they are waiting in this little book for your opening.  There is a beautiful message here as one grieving man finds the wider world just outside his grief in his own community, one his Rose always knew.	2003-04-14

Having read Wolfe's Mrs. Dalloway certainly helps stir one's interest in Cunningham's work.  But the triple story of three separate women in three separate time segments of the 20th century make for a bit of suspense as the chapters layer one another with individual revelations.  If you are planning on seeing the Oscar nominated actors in the film version, do yourself a favor and first read the book.  And once finished with Cunningham's book, go back and read Mrs. Dalloway.  There is genuine appreciation of writer conception and craft when one absorbs all three.  Well worth the hours spent!	2003-04-14

What a genuinely courageous and strong-willed woman she is!  Despite the directional and technical details that are a bit confusing to the average land lubber, Greenlaw's biographical tome relates the amazing facts involved in the dangerous job of commercial fishing.  Greenlaw's boat and crew, absolutely modern and up-to-date in all meters and communications, still rely on the ultimate on-site management skills of the captain with the crew, who all stand to sink or swim in their month long fishing trip. There are laughs along the way as Greenlaw relates previous experiences and excitement reigns as she and her crew make each haul. The economics of the operation present some surprising facts and create new appreciation in the reader.  Greenlaw's book would make a great parallel text in business management training. Her enthusiasm for her job is inspirational.  Her varied crew stands as a microcosim of a larger business operation of any kind.	2003-04-14

He has written a book in the spirit of magical realism that transports the reader first into 18th century Ireland and finally to colonial New York, to follow the vengeful quest of protagonist Cormac O'Connor.<br />This glorious story demands suspension of disbelief and seduces one into acceptance of the path Cormac must follow. Hamill's obvious love for all of mankind, no matter what race, color, or creed, meshes with his love for the granite isle of Manhattan and its incredible history.<br />Even the pages of the hardcover volume of this book are luxurious to the touch,  just as the words of this consummate story teller/journalist are to the eyes and soul of the reader.  <br />Having loved learning about New York through the detective fiction of Mann-Meyers (Marty and Annette) and Caleb Carr, I can recommend this Hamill tome as my favorite read of 2003 thus far.  <br />The descriptions are loaded, not unlike the journalistic style of a Dickens, but the suspense and romance of the story make Cormac O'Connor a Highlander type immortal who lives from 1730's to 9/11/01 and follows the fated course of a man who must never leave Manhattan.  <br />I highly recommend this book.  It gave me the personal satisfaction that one gains from &quot;talking&quot; with a good friend, and in this case, it is with Pete Hamill, the masterful journalist and novelist, who first convinced me he could tell a wonderful yarn when I read his earlier novel &quot;Snow in August.&quot;<br />Cormac O'Connor's life journey, which at times seems to be a cursed existence, and its ultimate message of hope is forever with me now.	2003-03-09

And sometimes, while reading the Pollifax series titles, I have had to set the books aside and shake off my irritation at this super-hero woman.<br />But this one grabbed me from the start, with Emily and her spouse, Cyrus Reed, vacationing together in Thailand on a &quot;sure-thing&quot; little assignment for Carstairs and Bishop of the CIA, back home in Virginia.<br />Gillman has a way of making Emily Pollifax an endearing protagonist who empathizes with her adversaries to the point of befriending them, and who survives miles of walking in the wrong shoes, eating the minimum of food, enduring the most hazardous of jungle trails and the dangers thereof.<br />There are always surprises in store for the reader.  The double identities are things one can guess at if you have read very many mysteries, but the touching revelations just add to the delight.<br />It would be nice to think that there is someone out there like Emily, who at the waning time of life is still up and after it and never too tired to try another adventure.  For me, the reader's position is the best place, with the comforts of home as I enjoy another quite dramatic journey that all winds up kosher, thanks to the skillful touch of a fine mystery writer, Dorothy Gillman Butters.

If you love light, escapist mysteries, with strong female protagonists, you will like the Alpine mystery series of Mary Daheim's.  I do not have to read things in series, and I find Daheim carefully reconnects the reader to the on-going characters and situations no matter which letter of the alphabet you pick up to read.  I do endorse starting with A, The Alpine Advocate, however, as it sets the true scene.  And protagonist Emma Lord is a wonderfully independent woman, a journalist of the big city of Seattle, who has purchased the little town news tome of Alpine, fictional, but very real, and invested her life and welfare in it.  As the outsider, she must adjust to the local controls, the old-timers already in place on her staff, and to the expectations of a town who sees her as NEW.  Her Catholic faith, her love of the wrong, and very unavailable man, and her love for a son with growing pains, and her brother, the charitable priest, give her substance the reader can sympathize with.  <br />There is so much fun in these works by Daheim, in repeating, quirky characters, in idyosyncrasies of nature, in a middle-aged, sexy woman, and her spunky approach to life.  Once you get hooked on Emma Lord, you will want to read all the books, which I believe are up to Alpine Obituary.  If you start, you will find Emma and her circle to be a set of old friends, suitable for any reader's entertainment.  There is red hot sex, suspense, laughter, and unexpected heartbreak.  But this is great escapist reading.  Fast, slick, and fun!	2003-01-02

Lily Owen's plight, a cruel, unfeeling peach- raising father, and the mystery of a long absent mother drive her to her fated discovery of an exceptionally powerful set of characters with a capital C, the women of the Black Madonna honey-making business.<br />The mixing of the races, black and white, with the down-trodden blacks nurturing and uplifting the destitute whites is a classic story of good versus evil on a cultural level so well understood by those who really lived in the South, even in more recent times.<br />Then mix in the voting rights issues and the standard horrors of white supremacy and violence against blacks and you have the suitable level of suspense that makes one keep reading.<br />Kidd's characters are reminiscent of the Melinda Haynes' characters in Mother of Pearl, weirdly wonderful, a true taste of honey.  There is a lot to learn as one joins in Lily's adventure as a seeker of her own identity and as a honey collector and processor.  The analogy of the two are perfect in this journey to self-discovery plot.	2002-12-31

But it won't be one of my favorites.  That wouldn't keep me from recommending it.  Heavens!  Everyone to his or her own choosing, is my thought!<br />But I got a bit tired of the heavenly circumstances and the fact that nothing would really be resolved.  And having read the blurb from respected writer Anna Quindlen on the back cover, comparing this book to To Kill A Mockingbird, just makes me wonder who was paying her to write the blurb.<br />The tragedy of this girl's death, horrible murder and rape and slaughter, and the continued life of her serial murderer is sickening.  Justice played out by nature is good, even humorous; unexpected, yet predictable.<br />I know this is a best seller, a runaway best seller, but I am glad I did not rush out to get it.  I would have been disappointed.  Am I glad I read it?  Of course!  I don't want someone else to make up my mind for me.<br />Would I recommend it?  Not without reservation.	2002-12-31

What an infinite study of character, the Forsyte character, men of ownership, of possession, of material things!<br />I waited for the PBS presentation with patient enthusiasm, and was not disappointed.  But knowing that video/movies can only do so much for a text, I unearthed my own private copy of Galworthy's book, one inherited from my aunt, and started the discovery by print.<br />I have been so overcome by Galsworthy's skill as a wordsmith, and so fascinated by his social commentary on this class of people, that I have broken away from the novel time and time again and done further research into Galsworthy and his own commentaries of his work, particularly on the Forsytes.  From his wife, Ada's preface, through his intro, to his chosen dedications, I am enchanted.  I feel remiss to not have read him before this time, but so grateful to have an old copy and to now enrich my life with these characters.<br />While not disappointed by the TV rendering, I am glad to know Soames, Irene, Old Jolyon, Young Jolyon, June, as Galsworthy painted them.  I am glad to see their physical makeup to be different than those of the actors and actresses in the PBS series, and to feel I know them much more completely now.  <br />I have a personal love of British lit and am so pleased to find such great storytelling in an older text.  The judges were so right in awarding prizes to Galsworthy.<br />The Forsyte Saga is not so foreign in time and portrayal.  Materialism still reigns and seduces and corrupts.  Class one-up-manship still deludes.  Self-importance and shallow values still prevail.  Feet of clay forever are feet of clay.	2002-12-31

Gruff and needy to the max, with unexpected aide from strong-willed out of the cloister nuns.  <br />Wouldn't you know that the nuns would meet with other ways of seeing God, typical enrichment by Gilman?  <br />This was another pick up and read title of a novel by an author I have recently come to admire.  And I do highly recommend your enjoyment of a definite period piece.

They have been out for years.  But I love the pattern of suspense and the new cultural treats that are in store for her readers.  I always learn in a Gilman book.  And her sense of respect for other ways of living, of relating to God and one another, enrich the tales she gives us.   <br />I recently gleaned the shelves of Half-Price Books and found a few of her titles I had not read, among them was Caravan.  And it is a true jewel of a tale.<br />One feels a bit like this character, a carny child sent to finishing school, is historical, a veritable Unsinkable Molly Brown, and yet the story, as told in retrospect by Lady Teal, encompasses only a small part of a very rich life.  And what a vibrant small part that is!<br />Caressa's survival in the stark desert life of the early 1900's is impressive, and Gilman's finesse in presenting a foreign world and its pecularities make for suspenseful reading beyond the norm.  One thing that Gilman never does is shy away from the brutal and the violent realities of her character's situations.  <br />In the primitive 1914 imprisonment that Caressa faces among the conquering Tuareg tribesmen, there are an amazing set of obstacles that just shouldn't have been lived through.  No Indiana Jones character could out do Caressa's challenges.<br />Most beautiful of all are the endearing friendships that she makes with the unusual likes of a fellow slave, a black boy, Bakuli, and earlier with Mohammed, her Arab host in Tripoli.  <br />Delightful endings wrap up Gilman's books with happily ever after as their due.  But one is not disappointed with Lady Teal's surprise to readers.  In fact, one should have guessed such an ending would be in store.<br />Typical Gilman in some ways, but very nice escapist reading overall.  Brava!	2002-12-31

Her ability to make all that money from writing stories that women want to read is not nearly as impressive as she is and as she reveals in this little memoir.  <br />I received this book as a delicious Thanksgiving Day birthday gift and read it in a couple of hours.  But it was dessert.  For I learned about a woman who is much more than a best-selling author.  I learned about a woman who pioneered in writing for radio and survived the financial hard times that came with life's ups and downs.  I learned about a woman who adored her first husband and her children, who was faithful to her mother and her family, who knew how to survive financially and emotionally and KEEP GOING.<br />I have yet to read a Mary Higgins Clark novel.  But I will soon.  I guess that I know my tendency to read an author's book leads me to try to read all the books that author has published, and I know I have a long line of titles awaiting me if I once start.<br />If you need to be uplifted, read this memoir.

I was well removed from reading the other books in the series, which I loved and gave away in sets to friends and loved ones.  And I think this little volume, so beautifully appointed with wedding graphics and chapter separations, is actually rather inspirational.<br />I had forgotten how Karon's skill in dialogue makes her characters come to life.  I was chuckling softly all the way through it, trying not to disturb my sleeping spouse.<br />The Reverend Tim's revelation of his good news at the Grill is priceless, presented as it is around the marvelous ballet of who is ordering what for lunch.  And each encounter with the regular pairs of characters, the Bolicks, the mayor and her spouse, Miss Sadie and Louella, Uncle Billy and Rose, Dooley and Barnabas, just warmed my heart.<br />On a smaltzie note, Tim and Cynthia's love and committment to one another is refreshing and endearing giving hope to the old romantics in so many of us.  Their fears and hesitancies are quite real, too.  The saying, &quot;There is no fool like an old fool,&quot; does not go unheeded in their cautionary moments.  <br />This is a feel good shortie that whets the appetite for another Jan Karon biggie.

Whoever loves artful writing and whodunit entwined will love P. D. James' latest Adam Dalgleish mystery.  Wonderfully set on the East Anglian coast midst ever-changing and threatening nature where an holy order of priests and would-be priests/ordinands reside, this mystery unwinds around the suspicious accidental death of a rich man's son.  And once the on leave Dalgleish joins the inquiry, murders just keep coming.<br />There is romantic, even incestuous, human fraility in this four part novel.  There are jealousy, animosity, cross purposes, greed, deceit, anger, depression and revenge at work. Each character is skillfully drawn, especially those that are linked with Dalgleish's past and present, and the setting exacts added suspense to a seemingly pastoral setting.  <br />The decline of the Arbuthnot estate's endowed theological seminary is central to the plot.  One can guess that each character is linked to that demise in some fashion.  And just as in a good Agatha Christie novel, the characters are tied to one another openly and in disguise, and await the skillful unraveling of the poetic and sensitive intellect of Dalgleish and his cohorts Kate, Piers, and Robbins.<br />Such a pleasure to relax into a well-written tome!  James makes Dalgleish a friend of the reader, a character come to life,  someone we know and willingly follow into a mystery that needs solving.	2001-04-18

Having never read Lois Battle, her newest tome is my first adventure into her writing.  I will now go back and look for other titles she has written. <br />Do I recommend this story of middle-age women struggling to survive?  Absolutely!  The spirit of the displaced homemakers from Cherished Lady lingerie's now closed plant is led by an unlikely cultured and privileged lady, Bonnie Duke Cullman.  Bonnie also finds herself in this displaced homemaker category, but for a much different reason:  bankruptcy and divorce.  <br />Rescued by her family connections, her daddy Duke is rich and influential, Bonnie finds work as a job counselor in tiny Florabama's junior college.  It is there, with the help of her long time friend Cass that Bonnie also finds herself.  <br />The Cherished Lady ex-employees comprise a mix of hard-working, down-on-their-luck seamstresses who have a new opportunity to go to college and learn the skills to get new jobs.  Of course they must do this while drawing unemployment, raising their grandchildren, resisting their spouses attempts to keep them down, caring for disabled spouses and dysfunctional adult children.  They are a colorful and realistic set of characters who grow on the reader.<br />Key to the plot are the women: Hilly, Ruth, Roxy, Albertine, Lyda Jane and Celia.  Key to the women's lives are the emotional baggage they have accumulated by living and the individual tastes for life that both bring them together and separate them.  Their small town plant has given them earning power and a sense of community.  With its closing, as the plant owners seek cheaper labor in Mexico, they are at the mercy of a world that looks for education in its future employees.  Their lives have to be upgraded and the local college has a government grant to provide that upgrade.<br />While one cannot help but laugh over the spirited and straight shooting expressions of Hilly, this novel also reflects the heartbreaks and disappointments that represent the darkside of the characters' lives.  This is also a love story, the story of Bonnie with Riz, Cass with Mark, Hilly with Jess.  Each partnership takes a different road, with the women coming out stronger and less dependent on romance or sex or men.  <br />Bonnie is the protagonist:  the divorced mom of grown, spoiled children, the daughter of wealth, the step-daughter of a restless, mouthy step-mom.  First, she surprizes herself by learning to respect and love her displaced Florabama homemakers.  Then she surprizes herself by realizing that independence is a good thing.  Furthermore, she surprizes herself with her own entrepreneurial abilities.  She lives through her time in Florabama and emerges realistically triumphant.<br />The love of friends is important in Battle's story:   the love of Cass and Bonnie, and Hilly and Ruth.  Author Battle understands that women do not have it easy in a man's world, but that they can survive and rise above life's challenges.  This is a positive, can't-put-it-down read.  Brava!	2001-04-10

However, I have never witnessed my students in such an uncontrollable state as the young Icy experiences.  In present day situations, medications exist to aid these children.  Thank heaven for medical and educational advances.  The fact that this novel takes place in the 1950's in Kentucky says a lot about the ways in which disabled children were treated in many places in the United States.  <br />While I enjoyed Icy's voice and her loving grandparents, Patanni and Matanni, I was saddened that Icy was whisked off to Bluegrass Mental Hospital's Sunshine facility.  Her school principal seems well-intentioned, however, and Icy grows from her experience, as she develops a life-long friendship with hospital attendant, Maizy. <br />To know that Icy only fits in with the misfits and oddballs represents the terrifying truth before mainstreaming in public schools.  The torments she suffers at the hands of her classmates and her teacher are inexcusable, but truthful.  Her horrid teacher reminds me of the cruel teacher in George Washington Gomez and the other horrid teachers who appear in the novels of Charles Dickens.<br />While Icy receives undying support and education from her obese storekeeper friend, it is tragic that she remains hidden from the people of Gensing, Kentucky.  One hopes these small town folks from the coal mines accept Icy as one of their own.  Yet, their lack of compassion and understanding reflects the tragically normal behavior that results from the fear of the unknown.<br />As Icy discovers an unlikely love in Peavey and then loses it to the onset of one of her spells, she moves deeper into isolation.  Her conflict with her grandfather seems to reflect the rejection she feels. Miraculously, after her beloved Patanni's death, she gets drawn into Matanni's new life as an active member of a church community.  It is the acceptance ofthis all-welcoming group of Pentecostal believers that begins to turn Icy's life around.  <br />Icy's singing in the Christmas pageant while at Bluegrass Hospital and the joy it gives her foreshadows her future.  Appropriately, her movement towards personal independence comes on July 4 as she sings in five different church choirs on the steps of the courthouse in Ginseng. She finally emerges from her incubation, and her self-acceptance and deliverance through music make for a joyful ending.  <br />Icy is unforgettable, but she is not my favorite character.  While I do not recommend this novel as a must read, there is understanding to be gained from reading it.  I definitely understand why Oprah chose it.  Her mission to broaden minds through reading continues.	2001-04-01

She's back, Olivia/Oliver Brown, poet/sleuth, that is.<br />This time she joins her bohemian friends at a rustic farmhouse for a weekend of gin, games, gossip, and sex for sex's sake.  And the intrigue begins when tempers flare and the host and hostess seem to part ways.  Then Olivia and current squeeze, Paulo, discover an icy apparition hanging from a tree.  The frozen female is none other than the nanny of the host and hostess, Fordy and Kate Vaude.  <br />The investigation of the suicide turned murder moves to Greenwich Village as the weekend guests return there for their &quot;normal&quot; lives.  Thus, Olivia, Harry, Mattie, Gerry, and the Hudson Dusters once again join ranks to solve things first.  (They all came together in Meyers' first Olivia Brown mystery, Free Love.)<br />Olivia waxes poetic and enthralls every male with whom she comes into contact, including the underworld character Monk Eastman who showers her with booze by the crate and roses by the dozen.<br />Meyers' delivers this easy read and keeps the solution a secret until the end.  This Oliver adventure involves characters in the Secret Service, the Pinkertons, the Black Hand, and the Ivy League poetry effete.  Olivia is still not my favoriate protagonist, by any means, but Meyers' certainly sets a scene of the decadence that followed the Great War in 1920's New York.	2001-03-23

Then when desparate for another written diversion, I finally read the waiting tome.  <br />Thus, having recently finished Amy Tan's latest novel and being intrigued with the discovery of the Peking Man in 1929, I read Nicole Mones' intriguing novel with a plot that also centers on the 1980's search for the Peking Man bones that were lost during WWII.  <br />I actually felt quite at home with Mones' book, as I had experienced a Tan baptismal of cultural information.  Although Alice/Mo-Ai-Li is a radical departure from the women in Tan's book, her restless, liberated, amoral behavior reflects her desperate search for inner peace.  For it is with Alice that the reader discovers a revered Chinese culture in which foreigners are second best and the skills of an American interpreter are seen as only talking.  <br />Curiously, Alice and her near penniless employer, Adam Spencer, get themselves into Mongol lands where the dragon bones/early man's bones are thought to be hidden.  Spencer's need to be an honored scientist parallels Alice's need to immerse herself in a culture other than her own.  She tries to escape her forced notoriety as the Alice of her racist U. S. Senator father.  Spencer tries to escape his low profile professorial position in order to win the admiration of his young son.  In a plot that feels a bit like Indiana Jones, Alice and Adam, accompanied by two Chinese paleontoligists, manipulate their way through the military watch dogs of the Peoples Liberation Army to the lost treasure.  <br />There is romance, very sensual sex, self-discovery, and a great twist at the end.  If you enjoyed The Bonesetter's Daughter, Lost in Translation will add to your enjoyment and knowledge of China in modern times.	2001-03-19

So, the grand adventure of a fatherless Irish Catholic altar boy in 1940's New York begins in snow.  The voice through the snow, that of a Jewish rabbi newly emigrated to the U. S., is Michael Devlin's call to adventure.  <br />An unlikely and captivating friendship results with Michael teaching the Rabbi English, and the Rabbi teaching Michael about the mystical truths of kabbalah, Yiddish, and the Jewish ghetto of centuries past Poland.  Just as Jackie Robinson emerges as the great black hope of baseball, Michael and Judah Hirsch emerge to fight off the racist, bullying Falcons.  <br />The fantasy of the Golem, a Jewish enforcer of justice, is restored to legendary status here.  There is plenty of suspense and torture to overcome as Michael stands up for his Jewish friend and for his mother and himself.  Michael comes of age through his exhibition of courage.  <br />Did it really happen?  Who cares?  This is a great story with a happy ending.  Get transported to another time when all things are possible.  Read Snow in August.  Or hope for a great movie version.	2001-03-14

Because his book George Washington Gomez was not published in the late 1930's when Paredes wrote it, only a rough draft version was released shortly before he died.<br />To me, this version of Texas historical fiction along the valley border presents a side to Mexican American settlement that few other books reveal.  I find Paredes' story powerful and well worth reading.<br />Gualinto, little George Washington Gomez, is the American born son of his illegal immigrant parents; his father is an outlaw of some notoriety.  The birth name his parents give him symbolizes their hope that he will become the leader of his people in America.  But their hopes take a big detour as this little boy grows up in fictional Jonesville as a spoiled only son in a matriarchal household.  With his father dead, the only strong male role for Gualinto is his reformed outlaw uncle.<br />Gualinto suffers the insults and taunts of growing up as a member of the poor and powerless society of South Texas.  His family is subjected to the cruelities of racist Anglos, including the unattractive side of El Renche, the Texas Rangers.  Even in an all Mexican American school for children, Gualinto is embarrassed and punished for his lack of academic accomplishment by the spinster Mexican American teacher .  Those classroom scenes remind one of the cruelties found in Tom Brown's School Days and the writings of Charles Dickens.<br />Surrounded by love at home, treated kindly by some of the Jonesville citizenry, insulated from the cruelities exacted on his sisters who do not adhere to their mother's demands, Gualinto grows to adolescence and a time of continued social positioning that often leads to rejection.<br />The values that Gualinto develops reflect his survival in the South Texas that is his home.  When he heroically departs the community to gain that all important college education, he also departs from the hoped for role his parents once projected.  In the end, his story is one of betrayal and tragedy, but not unrealistic.  <br />From having my senior Hispanic students read Gomez, I experienced feedback that was invaluable.  They were amazed that such a novel, telling the side of many of their people existed.  Tragic or not, the novel rang true for them.  I recommend this novel over and over to students, fellow teachers, and readers.  It offers an eye-opening view of another side of the South Texas story.	2001-03-13

It is this grudge which moves the story line.  <br />Twelve-year-old Natalie determines to invade the Inn that is off limits to her Jewish family.  She insinuates herself into an extra vacation with the family of a fellow camper, regular Gentile visitors at the Inn.  This childish plot results in Natalie's epiphany that not all things at Lake Devine are that special, including her rather ditzy Gentile friend.<br />Yet, in her life to follow, as she moves into the hospitality business, Natalie becomes more intimately involved in the lives of her rivals, the Gentiles.  Her experiences reveal the life of Jewish vacation resorts with their special menus, entertainment, and delightful characters in contrast to the Gentile establishments she seeks to integrate.<br />The Inn at Lake Devine is an easy read and provides some belly laugh moments.  With its romantically cliche and comforting resolution, it should make a good chick flick.	2001-03-12

If you like mysteries that are rich with detail and multiple plot lines, you will like the writing of Jane Haddam.  Gregor Demarkian is a most interesting sleuth with many connections in the community of Maryville from past detections in other novels.  As we are near St. Paddy's Day, I picked up this volume by Haddam in honor of the event.  I have not read any other Demarkian mysteries, but I will.  I like the snippets of characterization that are revealed piece by piece.  As a non-Catholic, I am fascinated by the life of the convent and the political structure of the church.  This inticately knit community lends itself to the mystery.  If you like mystery, try on a Jane Haddam read.	2001-03-12

I don't think I am really old-fashioned, but I found Olivia Brown to be young and shallow.  <br />Her bohemian life in the environs of Greenwich Village circa 1920 is intriguing enough for a relaxing read, however.  And, I, too, was not sure I had the culprit clearly named until pretty close to the end.  Actually, the obsession of the men around Olivia (Oliver to her cronies) is believable, if one realizes that they are all gin-soaked and willing to participate in any free love (sex) made so readily available.  <br />The strong friendship between Olivia and her caretaker Mattie is touching.  Once again we see the faithful servant class guarding and protecting their upper class employer.  Lucky Olivia to have inherited this brownstone from her rebellious great aunt Vangie, to have inherited Mattie's help, and to have inherited in perpetuity, a private eye tenant, Harry Melville.  <br />Olivia's interjected poems reflect the supposed burning genius of an artist whose decadent life fuels her gift.  Some of those &quot;inspirations&quot; fell cold on me.  Olivia's theatrical experience, particularly in O'Neill's off-Broadway introduction of The Emperor Jones, was quite sensual and led me to believe that it would not have taken much for Olivia to have shared a bi-sexual liason with the women in her group.  <br />I am sure I will try the next Olivia Brown novel when Meyers publishes it.  In the meantime I will try her Smith and Wetzon and her co-written Dutchman series.  Having seen Meyers and her spouse Marty on CBS Sunday Morning as a featured couple, I want to read what they have written, just for kicks.	2001-03-11

Behrani, like him or hate him, is driven to make a high class, honorable life for his wife and son, after pulling off a marriage coup for his daughter.  His plan includes the most menial of labor for income, and the disguised good life in which he seems to live a life of ease.  It also includes the purchase of an auction block house, put there by non-payment of back taxes, a house that will bring the downfall of Behrani and his family, as well as the life of Kathy Nicolo and her insanely driven good-cop-gone-bad lover.<br />Nicolo and her lover deteriorated into people I could not tolerate.  And as Behrani fought them off, he, too, declined to his most despicable, destructive self.  In general, Behrani and his family, especially his wife and son, gained my sympathy.<br />I don't see this novel as being so important that it is pivotal in my reading experience.  But it is a very different take on the immigrant experience and I am grateful for the picture Dubus gives me of the Behrani family and their culture.  I don't think that there are any simple rights and wrongs here.  Instead I am reminded of the classic tragedies in great literature where resolution results in total destruction.  Very sad indeed!	2001-03-11

For in The Bonesetter's Daughter, Amy Tan has written the Chinese-American version of a task so familiar to American Baby Boomers of all cultural backgrounds:  the story of adult children and their parents.  <br />Tan's portrayal of Ruth and her mother in their patterns of love and near hate, of communication with reservation is right on target.  When living a busy personal life, it is hard to come to grips with the needs of elderly parents, to take the time to finally know them as one should.  Ruth's need to take on the parent role, to take care of her mother, to accept her mother in spite of past misunderstandings, is redolent of so many of us who have &quot;been there, done that.&quot;<br />The dialogue and mimicked accents of Chinese pronunciation are always perfect in Tan's writing.  Thank heaven for the comic bantering between mother and daughter.  One chapter brings out-loud laughter, the next somber thoughtfulness.  Tan's three part novel sets the stage for the importance of Ruth's mother's past in China, an obscured past with secrets, ghosts, and horrors. <br />Once again, Ms. Tan has captured my imagination, entertained and moved me, brought me to an enhanced understanding of the importance of family, no matter what the culture.	2001-03-09

This is a book that should please.  The well-thumbed trade paperback in our library continues to be checked out and praised.  Even since the movie was released, folks still want to read the words of Billie Letts, a comic, heart-felt word crafter.<br />Such great names as Novalee and Americus Nation, Willy Jack Pickens, Sister Husband, Moses Whitecotton, make the reader want to see what this is all about.  And Novalee's superstition over the number 7 adds to the folksie manner in which Letts develops her story.  As to plot, a baby born in a Wal-Mart, why not?<br />In one episode, you find yourself laughing out loud, and in another there is suspense, sorrow, and a teary eye.  Letts gives you the full experience in a book that can't be put down.  Add these characters to your friends in print.  And read The Honk And Holler Opening Soon, too.  While not a sequel, exactly, it does depict another set of Sequoiah, Oklahomans who are a part of another good story.  <br />Letts is a talented story teller.

The great myths and legends of the literary past are redolent in the plot lines of Rowling's work.  She obviously understands the meaning of archetypal hero journeys and honors the ages old story tellers by adding Harry to the list.<br />This pitiful little survivor, Harry, finally meets with his fortune and his future and tackles the task of maturity while fighting to avenge the evil that befell his parents.  He is a gifted student, a child ready for development into the best weapon against He Who Must Not Be Named.<br />Taking this first journey with Harry will either confirm your doubts about Rowling's intent as an author, or open your eyes to the innocent pleasure of a good story that continues in three other books.  (The other three are in the works.)<br />Seeing the Warner Brothers website, getting sorted into a Hogwarts' school, buying Harry Potter games, puzzles, ornaments, loving the movie trailer, are the fanaticisms to which this good reading may lead.

She was also writing the Robin Paige Victorian mysteries with hubby Bill.  I bought all the books she had out at the time and carried them home aflush with the joy of personally autographed copies.  <br />Then, finally, this winter I began to enjoy China Bayles, even out of sequence.  But this first volume in the set, Thyme of Death, certainly is one to make a reader want to read the rest of the books.  China, named after her grandmother,  is a strong woman, an ex-Houston-tough attorney in retreat to a quieter life as herb store owner.  Her fictional location in Pecan Springs is wonderfully familiar to any Hill Country Texan.  Albert worked as Dean of Women at South West Texas State University in San Marcos and knows the country intimately.  <br />Fictional China just can't get away from the crime scenes that she thought she left behind in Houston, however.  And before long she is enlisted in solving a crime with her outrageous New Age fellow shop owner and friend Ruby in tow. China's herb shop ownership lends itself to rich teachings about herbs, and a clever tie in to the crime in each novel.  Dealing with the small town John law and the county mountie sheriff requires extra savvy from Ms. Bayles.  She is plenty capable of handling crime, customers, and hot, spicy, chile-flavored dishes which she comfortably washes down with Texas brew in the local country western juke joint.  <br />If you like smart females who are in charge of their own lives, you will like China Bayles.  Even when she unwillingly softens to the courtship of an ex-Houston cop turn criminology professor, she remains fiercely independent and of the '90's, headed for the 21st century.  <br />To read one of Albert's China Bayles' mysteries is to set yourself up to read another and another and another.	2001-02-28

With each multicultural title I read I become more and more amazed by the sacrifices that immigrant people make by seeking their fortunes in a New World.  Learning about the U. S. closure to Chinese immigration was news to me.  And realizing that the only course for Chinese men was to immigrate through Canada opened up at least two new vistas.  The one in Canada of Chong's grandmother, the child of the concubine, was so primitive and pain filled; I was intrigued to know that it could be survived.  To learn of the custom of the Chinese man having family in China that was honored and in the New World that was less highly regarded surprised me even more.  The child's struggle through rejection, poverty, parental alcoholism and addictive gambling, and sexual promiscuity seemed nearly impossible.  <br />To enrich Chong's narrative, a biography no less, she includes family pictures.  And the links back to the family in China show the culture that is stuck in another century, another time.  It is a picture that reveals family that is revered though separated by distance and time.  Reading this book enriched my understanding of a people about which I knew very little.  I highly recommend this book.  It is an extension past the very excellent fiction of Amy Tan and well worth the read.	2001-02-28

We completely fell for Luke, the farm boy of the 50's.  As the son of an Oklahoma tenant farmer, my husband felt that Grisham got the tension over a boom crop of cotton and the impending weather change that would ruin it just right.  He recalls the force of flood waters.  The description of the river's waters taking over the family crop are familiarly heartbreaking.  <br />As an avid Grisham fan, I see his skills of suspense and the threats of violence are not diminished.  I really hoped the bully would get his just reward, much as I wanted the rapists of A Time to Kill to get theirs.<br />A Painted House is gentler in some ways, but no less a good Grisham.  The characters are richly reminiscent of other good Southern reads.  There is special humor in Pa's driving speed and the shit house snake.  I am glad Grisham chose to share this story first through the Oxford American and finally with us all.  Both of us in this household recommend this good read.	2001-02-28

Just when I thought I had read some of the worst descriptions of man's brutality to man, along comes a friend asking if I had read The Alienist.  Well, I have to say, Caleb Carr really packs a punch.  You feel like you are right there retching with the journalist narrator over the god-awful discovery of a madman's victim.  And it is quite eerie to imagine those gaslit times in old New York with debauchery lurking, eager to corrupt. <br />The secret detective team led by a psychiatrist/alienist is a curious set of allies, employed by Teddy Roosevelt no less.  Their progress against a calendar of impending murders is nearly a mission impossible.  With them, the reader just has to pursue an end... story feels rather like a nightmare... <br />No doubt about it, Caleb Carr is a wordsmith who recreates this horror from an era thought to be golden.	2001-02-28

The nature gods of Jacob's wives and father-in-law reside side by side with El, or Jehovah.  (In Zimmer Bradley's work, the nature or pagan gods conflict with the Judeo-Christian teachings.) Incredibly, Jacob holds faithful to his one true God in all practices, including relating the story of his father Isaac, and Abram's commanded offering of Isaac to test Abram's loyalty.  <br />It is through the words of Dinah, one gains such a rich and earthy perspective of Leah and Rachel, and the lesser know Zilpah and Bihlah.  One realizes that polygamy as these women know it sustains them, as well as their progeny.  <br />The respect and communal survival of the tribe of Jacob is dependent on the strength and harmony of his wives.  Their time in The Red Tent lends a sacredness to womankind unlike that which many women acknowledge in present times.  Life was simpler and more basic then, of course.  But the simplicity strongly shouts out to the reader that the practices of these nomadic women is the reason for life.  <br />What a beautiful tribute to women Diamant assembles in this novel!  Even the harshest of scenes seems to add to the mystic quality of the book.  The Red Tent will now serve as another female symbol in my mind.  Dinah may have met with singular mention in the Bible, but her story as related in Diamant's fiction makes her memorable along with the women of Arthurian legend, Native American history, and all strong women in general.  Dinah's voice deserves Diamant's vivid portrayal as it appears in this magnificent historical novel.	2001-02-27

Anyone who thinks they know her story should read this massive work.  Certainly, with Lorna Luft's revealing TV miniseries airing these two days, people are once again made aware of the tragedy of the talented Judy G.  But Clarke's book lets the reader in on the childhood abuses that started her dual spirals: up to fame and down to self-doubt and drug abuse.  Judy was a much maligned woman who served the needs of others as the essential breadwinner for them all.  She made some really bad personal choices, but who can blame her.  She was manipulated into liasons that bled her dry.  It is amazing that her body held up as long as it did.  Surely, with all she gave and suffered there is some peace in her hereafter.  The sordid seamy side of her life is balanced with the love she had for her children and the men in her life.  She certainly deserved more than she received.  This biography is a must read.  The ironic title hints at the real story.	2001-02-26

What one gets is a new appreciation of this hunk of a film star.  Lancaster was a film genius.  He had the personal drive of a starving Irish artist, who did whatever it took to succeed.  Learning of his life in the circus and in the Depression Era theater adds dimension to this pretty boy.  Lancaster never lacked the desire to go further than just his pretty face.  He saw the market potential for independent filmmakers and met the challenge.  If anything, Buford's exacting details of Lancaster's business dealings slow the reading down.  But one gains respect for Lancaster over all.  Amazingly loyal to wife and family, Lancaster's final days without that tie to Norma were somewhat melancholy.  However, what a rich life he had!  What a gifted, determined actor he was!  Despite the seamy immorality that always seems to rear its ugly head in these star biographies, one gains new admiration for the Hollywood star who was much more than a celluoid dream.  Not a speedy read, but worthwhile.	2001-02-26
US	50685026	R35HRRBVFIUWUA	0374329591	747795176	Herbert Rowbarge	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Ironic twin story should be renewed in print	While checking the shelving of our library's fiction pit, I came across this curious Babbitt title from 1982. Looking quite new and seldom read, I put it with the stack of other titles that I knew I must read.  Thus I discovered the magically tragic little saga of orphaned twins, especially the one who would grow to self-made success despite the haunting background of leaving his other self behind.  He, Herbert Rowbarge, is the unchosen twin for whom life seems quite bleak.  And yet by ruthless self determination, he rises to power and wealth through a business world which, of all things, reaps riches from a fantasy world theme park.  His is a determined and cold mien.  He loses the love he really wants and takes a rich second best; he closes his heart to both his wife and twin daughters.  He attempts to destroy those who reject him, as well as those who loyally serve him, as he controls the world that has offered him little warmth and comfort.  He is respected and wealthy, and the recipient of his daughters' solicitude.  No one seems to know his dark secrets.  The twists that Babbitt employs in Herbert Rowbarge are certainly more adult than her children's titles, but typical of her style with its twist at the end.  Reading Herbert Rowbarge is a curious trip with an unforgettable result.  I'd like to see a renewed interest in this O.Henry like little tome.  Good reading!	2001-02-25

This collection of her essays was purchased for our library to add to our creative writing teacher's curricular tools.  I couldn't resist being the first to sample same.  Alvarez has a way of talking to the reader that makes her essays ever so readable.  I especially love the personal illuminations of her family in the Dominican Republic and in the states.  What a fascinating immigrant story!  One of my favorite essays is &quot;Chasing the Butterfies&quot; which put chills on me as I recalled the power in her novel that made me into her fan.  I am not surprised that she is connected to the Bread Loaf writers.  What quality comes from that group!  I was a late-in-life discoverer of writers outside of the CANON, but I never again shall believe that only the canon has quality.  The multicultural writers that I have discovered since 1992 as a member of the NEH sponsored Common Ground at the University of Houston, have enriched my life and the lives of my students.  Any would be writer should read these Alvarez revelations.  Being able to come and go from the entries makes the work so very user friendly.  Brava, Julia!	2001-02-25

No one growing up in the safety of the U.S. can fully understand the amount of courage these sisters had to have.  They faced the threat of death and imprisonment with each attempt they made as members of the underground in El Salvador, seeking to overthrow the horrors of Trujillo and his SIM.  Even though their deaths are inevitable, the suspense and joys one finds in reading Alvarez' novel make them legendary.  I have taught and continue occasionally to teach children from El Salvador.  This book gives me heightened respect for what their families experienced at the same time that I knew comfort and security.  I am enriched by the verasimilitude of Alvarez' characterizations.  Her book is a shrine to these heroic butterflies of iron, not unlike the shrine of their home now maintained by their surviving sister DeDe.  <br />After finishing the novel Alvarez' mother tearfully said, &quot;You put me back in those days. It was like I was reliving it all.  I don't care what happens to us!  I'm so proud of you for writing this book.&quot;  Alvarez' parents were part of the underground and escaped El Salvador just ahead of the death of the Mirabal women.  To understand the fears of those who live in dictatorial countries, read In the Time of the Butterflies.  You will never forget it.	2001-02-25

I was not disappointed.  This is a powerful book, reminiscent of In the Time of Butterflies by Julia Alvarez, yet still a story that stands on its own.  To say I was moved is an understatement.  The lives of Benitez' characters are once more irrevocably intertwined and fascinating as they face the challenges of a life in El Salvador in times of military and political injustice.  The strength of Benitez' women is exemplary.  I highly recommend this book, one from which I take another set of priceless friends.  Brava!	2001-02-24

So, one considers the native citizenry of Benitez's Mexican tourist village of Santiago, impoverished in the main, and subject to a cruel fate.  What is especially potent in this very readable short book is the manner in which Benitez interweaves her characters with their diverse problems and needs into one another's lives. Remedios' presence as the curandero sets the tone;  these lives are fated to face life head on, just as the forces of nature ebb and flow. Their fates are an integral part of nature itself.<br />Since its publication in 1993, I have used Benitez' book as a springboard for multicultural reading for my senior English students.  I still recommend it for use with other students.  I emphatically recommend it to any reader.	2001-02-24

Anne George dishes both up in each of her Southern Sister &quot;Murder&quot; books.  She can make you laugh out loud when you read of Mary Alice and Patricia Anne and their escapades.  I have purchased and given sets of George's books as gifts to folks ranging in age from 30-80.  All have agreed that these are fun mysteries.  Murder Carries a Torch does not disappoint.  George rehashes enough in each book of the series to keep the reader from feeling lost.  The books do follow a publication date sequence, but reading them out of sequence does not hurt at all.  Having emailed Anne George and receiving her reply, I am anxiously awaiting Murder Does the Dirty Boogie With Elvis.  Treat yourself!	2001-02-22

His work truly works one's mind.  There is no easy way through a Morse tale, even this last one.  Dexter's use of appropos tidbits to introduce each short chapter have the links one finds in Annie Proulx.  These Dexter novels are no simple whodunnits.  <br />I, too, love the PBS Mystery series featuring Morse and plan on taping and watching The Remorseful Day and its prequel The Final Morse this Thursday night.  I am glad that I met the challenges of reading the novel first.<br />One feels that Morse's death is a self-fulling prophecy.  His alcoholism and diabetes do not produce a new Morse, just a dying one.  This demise is both inevitable and in character.  All the strings are found and tied up with this final chapter of his life.  <br />I find that I am not only entertained by Dexter's writing.  I grow mentally as well.  I really must get to Oxford before I die.  Now that Morse is gone, I have one more reason.	2001-02-21

This story of the pagan chocolatier allegorically debunks the stifling position of the Catholic church's blemished control of a small, staid French town.  Gradually Vivanne seduces the townspeople out of their rut and into living and loving life.  A tale of good versus evil with a wry twist, this little book brings back memories of beautiful Swiss chocolate shop window displays on a summer trip long past.  In the case of this little war, the gypsy good wins out over the corrupted town and church leaders.	2001-02-17

My curiosity about the title of Dallas' book led me in, and once again I discovered her artful way of meshing a group of women, friends by community links, and introducing a mystery that seems dangerous to solve.  Queenie and Grover are the rocks of the novel's community.  But Rita's determination drives the story to a surprising solution.  I wondered if this book would in any way link to Butte and the location of Dallas' first book.  I was delighted to know that it did, in the most subtle of ways.  I believe that Sandra Dallas knows what makes for good reading for women.  I highly recommend this book as well as her first.  Her obvious knowledge of people makes her characters both real and memorable.  A comfortable read.	2001-02-12

Strolling through my local SAM's, I discovered Sandra Dallas' trade paperbacks, and I'm hooked,  and recommending them all.  The Unholy Trio of May Anna, Whippy Bird, and Effa Commander are the real hooks of this wonderful retrospective fiction about the local poor girl who makes it big.  It fascinates me to read of the depression era and of the spunk of kids who survive it and live to full lifetimes still linked to one another.  Such cleverness and close friendships make me feel as if I know these people/characters.  I've never really been to Butte, Montana, nor understood the ways of a mining town, but this delightful tome makes me feel as though I know it just the same.  Dallas' characters remind me of the joy I have found in Fannie Flagg's work.  I have recommended Sandra Dallas to various readers and found them to be equally pleased.  Buster Midnight's Cafe with its secrets and humor is a marvelously relaxing read.	2001-02-12

I took pleasure in reading Mattie's words in her diary.  But I also wanted to take a swift kick at foolish Luke.  Even knowing that Mattie was being played a fool, I still kept reading.  <br />In truth, I was not thrilled to read of Mattie's devotion to her cad of a spouse.  I tired of her imprisonment in this marriage where her &quot;dear boy&quot; really loved another woman and trifled on her.  But I admired her determination to survive their primitive, pioneer life and its heartbreaks.  I guess I was just too determined to finish it anyway.  And it was worth it!<br />Once again, Sandra Dallas has created a fine retrospective novel that is framed in the discovery of a very elderly woman's grandmother's diary.  With all the emphasis on women telling their history, I can see where Dallas found her lure for this tale.  I especially liked the characters on the frontier who surrounded Mattie, however, and was fearful for her in her left-alone state.  The horrors she faced sometimes reminded me of another Mattie in Charles Portis' True Grit.  <br />This touching story is a historical romance, something that I thought I no longer wanted to read.  But I did read it and am glad.  I want to read the next Sandra Dallas book as soon as possible.	2001-02-12
US	50685026	R2F91KU55WFGKL	0375409084	71254966	Gertrude and Claudius	Books	5	20	22	N	N	Another turn at Hamlet	Skillful writing will out.  Updike's premise of merging the ancient legends of the Danish court into an intimate insight of Gerutha/Geruthe/Gertrude and the men in her royal existence is fascinating.  His storyteller's finesse respects the historical reality of necessary royal matchmaking with Gerutha as the center of the story.  <br />Taking the point of view of the mother of Hamlet, that mad Danish prince, Updike reveals Gertrude as a woman with the same passions of women of today.  Updike's characterization of her as fearing her only child and sensing his ability to bring about doom makes her a uniquely sympathetic woman.  Gertrude's world is at the mercy of her men: first her father and his Lord Chamberlain,  then her husbands, and then her son.  However, her attempt at experiencing life within those confines makes for a timeless story.<br />Getting to know Gerutha more intimately means getting to know all of her men more intimately. Rorik, Horwendil, Coriambus, Amleth and Feng become very real people as they develop in their relation to the queen and emerge in the familiar names of Hamlet, Polonius, and Claudius.    <br />This little tome is an easy read, one that begs the reader to keep going.  The use of three parts to show the progress of the tale from the Latin record into the German and finally the English adds to the story's richness as it continues over the centuries into the time when it becomes the Shakespearian tragedy known as Hamlet.  Updike obviously loves the English language and his love affair as a mighty wordsmith stands him in high regard.  I highly recommend any Shakespearian fan to try this prequel on for size.  For anyone who has studied the play, read the Stoppard version, seen the Olivier, Gibson, and Branagh film versions, this book just adds more gravy to the tradition.  Bravo!	2000-12-27

The luxuries on a budget managed by the brother and sister Brewster duo smack of favorite Christie mysteries set in a similar time in Great Britain.  Lily and Robert accept their challenge to fulfill their Uncle Horatio's will and seek paying guests to their inherited domain.  Their cleverness in luring a popular author of the times, fictional Julian West and his man Bud Carpenter, draws a nice mix of eccentric paying customers.  <br />Of course, their best laid plans result in an unplanned murder and the who-done-it is on in the most suspenseful of fashions.  An inveterate mystery reader may well figure things out ahead of the end, but it seems that Churchill excells in making the reader wait to unravel the answers.  <br />There are poignant moments in the interaction of characters, and Churchill lets the reader into the background connections of the characters just enough to develop them as well-rounded and believable.  The desires, jealousies, deceits, and manipulations the characters employ draw the reader in until the end.  <br />Historical data, i. e. the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby, Hoover's misbegotten administration, Governor Franklin Roosevelt's presumed candidacy for President, the poverty of out-of-work, homeless, depression era people, puts everything into perspective.  Churchill has done her homework.  Even the menus prepared by Mrs. Prinney entice the reader with the details of Dutch cooking appropriate to the historical settlement of the Hudson River Valley.  Churchill's descriptions are so good that one wishes to get a real taste of the Prinney cuisine.<br />One can only guess what the next books in the series will bring for Lily and Robert Brewster as they fulfill the ten year trial demanded by their deceased uncle's attorney, Mr. Prinney.  There already appears to be possible romance for Lily with either the new town sheriff or the new town newspaper editor.  And Phoebe Twinkle, Grace and Favor's new lodger has her own prospects to consider, in addition to maintaining her millinary business in Voorburg-on-the-Hudson.  Robert may be in for a settling down as well as he acclimates to this quieter lifestyle in coming books.  Anticipating where Churchill will lead the reader in further Brewster sleuthing makes one anxious to read her next volume.	2000-11-01
