US	49189532	R2JI2L015PM9RL	0486406555	559841412	Main Street (Dover Thrift Editions)	Books	5	46	48	N	N	Brilliant	Sinclair Lewis decided to paint a picture of the difference between small town life, and urban sophistication by telling the story of a young educated city woman who marries a doctor and moves to a small town.  Lewis was really just going to make a simple story about class differences and the isolation between folks, and throwing in some of his own experiences from growing up in small town Minnesota.  What he ended up with was a brilliant book that when first published in the early 20's struck a huge chord with the American public and became a huge seller and cultural phenomenon. <br /> <br />Carol Kennicott moves to fictional 'Gopher Prairie' in hopes of changing the town to a place of great city-sophistication that she can revel in.  Her mind is set on changing the townsfolk and its inhabitants ways which she finds aloof and backward.  Without giving away too much of the plot (which others I am sure here have already discussed), she runs into townsfolk who share her idea, and many who are suspicious of her motives. <br /> <br />What Lewis shows in great passage and scenery (you can literally touch and feel every blade of prairie grass he describes) is that even though Carol's ambitions seem great, (particularly when confronting all the clique like prejudices that pervade the small town), her methods come off as pretty high-falouting and preposterous based on a great deal of misunderstanding.  Nobody in the novel has the right method on how people should live, but somehow everyone manages to live within their own personal bubble.  You want to cheer Carol on (or wait hoping she will fall on her face if you feel that way), but you at least understand and realize the mindset that plagues people who want to come in to your life-home-family-town can be an almost impossible barrier. <br /> <br />The novel is unbelievably timeless.  Reading this now I couldn't believe how the similar parallel issues that exist in this story are still relevant right now.  Issues of Blue State vs. Red State,   and how America right now is so divided speak volumes about how much this book is so on target even after several decades after its initial publication. <br /> <br />This book is without question a snapshot of America, there are many \\"Gopher Prairies\\" and \\"Carol Kennicots\\" (and all the other townspeople who you have met at some point) out there, and that is the absolute brilliance of this book.  And of course the book has an American setting, but the conflicts that happen in this book could be happening anywhere in the world in any country.  The small town vs. big city fight is universal. <br /> <br />This is the greatest American novel I have ever read thus far bar none.	2005-09-30

Nevertheless, Augusten Borroughs manages to steer away from most of that in providing an angle of a dysfunctional adult gay male who enters rehab, only to return to sobriety falling for a patient in the clinic who is still battling a crack addiction. <br /> <br />Augusten manages to keep the viewer entertained by giving his sarcastic gay perspective an open voice.  He paints a picture that most of us will never see or understand but gladly want to hear about it.  To boot, Augusten even manages to throw in a couple zingers at times claiming at one point, \\"gay alcoholic men don't just go to the meetings to get better, it's because they are addicted to the drama\\". <br /> <br />I am paraphrasing there, the quote isn't exact but you get the idea of where Augusten's warped sense of drama and writing comes from.  It provides for some great writing and an enjoyable harmless read. <br /> <br />Zippy, entertaining, and fun!  Enjoy!	2005-09-27

Dogs of Babel's basic plot, involves the death of a wife named Lexy that falls from a tree.  Or at least that's what is suspected.  The only witness is their dog, so the determined linguist professor Paul decides he will decode the secrets of his wifes death by teaching Lorelei to speak.    Parkhurst's novel works when it shows a couple coming together through usefull flashbacks, and Paul's grief of trying to get inside his dogs head.  The small successes that Paul has, and the numerous failures he has with Lorelei give great insight into a mind that doesn't know how to cope with grief.  As the novel continues we start also understanding the mindset of Lexy as a bit of a troubled eccentric.  Shortly things get pieced together slowly between an absurd idea, and a woman who has some inner demons we're not quite sure of.  You patiently and excitedly await the outcome of both story angles.. until... the book gets to the half way mark.    Unfortunatly at the half way mark where the reader is waiting for a bigger expected climax, the author introduces the \\"Cerebus Society\\", (for reasons of plot spoiling I won't go into, but others have pointed out on this site) that is absolutely... ridiculous.  In reading the book at this point I couldn't take it seriously many times laughing at the ridiculousness of it.  Shortly after the meeting of the \\"Cerebus Society\\", the tone of the novel changes, and the dog is kidnapped.    Since suddenly there is no dog, the conflict between Paul and Lorelei is gone which is the best part of the novel, and you are stuck in limbo with a stupid plot device, and then a novel that runs quickly into its conclusion.    There is also a plot hole (describing it would be a spoiler).  Basically in a nutshell, Paul suddenly remember something about his wife months after she died.  The reality is after she died the police/coroner WOULD HAVE discovered \\"this\\" right away and TOLD HIM at the time of the death. This \\"discovery\\" is obviously used later in the novel as a gasp moment for when the writer has run out of a way to make the book more interesting.    It's okay reading, and the writer has a gift for getting into the mindset of characters somewhat, but this giant wrench throws the book off place, and takes away the main focus of what made the story good in the first place.  That of a man locked in grief with someone who can't get answers, but thinks he can.    Sorry can't recommend it.	2005-07-14
US	49189532	RELKEOT1Y1R7V	0679723161	636015448	Lolita	Books	1	19	96	N	N	ugh..	you know, I've heard a lot of Nabokov, and consider reading Russian writers a bit of a hobby for me.  So when I heard about him I was eager to give this book a try.  Considering all the Dostoevsky, Turgenev, Gogol, and Chekov I read, I thought I'd be in for a treat.    Boy was I wrong.    Nabokov's novel 'Lolita' about an old man who lusts (that's right not loves LUSTS) after a pre-pubescent girl, is the most banal boring prose I've ever come across.  Nabokov's narration while sometimes creative just goes on... and on... and on..  plus he gives no insight into his characters at all most simply because they have no dialogue what so ever.  Perhaps the only dialogue I seem to remember from this book, was the words \\"you rapped me\\".  So how can I feel for any of the characters in this book after that?  huh?   Would I want to identify with the main protoganist who just can't stop thinking of his sick ways?  I don't think so.    I suppose many decades ago you could write a book like this and get noticed with the shock value, but if this book was released now, no-one would even pay attention to it, it would be passed off for what it is, toilet literature, and then be relegated to the garbage can.    I also realised Nabokov's insights are completley uncomprensible in his literary approach.  In some of his out of print lectures that I've read, he thinks Dostoevesky as a weak writer with the exception of perhaps \\"The Double\\".  As someone has already mentioned, there is more development and briliance in ONE PAGE of Crime and Punishment compared to this trash.    So instead of me wasting time on this book here are some real Russian authors and stories that you should read over this junk.    Dostoevesky -    Notes from Underground, The Idiot, Crime And Punishment, Demons, The Brothers Karamazov (these are masterpieces!)    Mikhail Bulgakov - The Master and Margarita    Turgenev -  First Love, Spring Torrents    Gogol - Dead Souls    Solyzheneitsen - One Day In the Life of Ivan Denisovich    etc...    One star for some interesting wordplay, but otherwise don't bother.	2005-06-16

However, I was hoping to get more stories of adventure type quality than the 3 locations she spoke about (Russia, China, Cuba). <br /> <br />When she talks about stealing bed sheets in Russia, or chugging alcohol at her first introductory lunch in China, the book is great.  You sit back and laugh and connect with the cultural \\"mistakes\\" the traveler is going through.  Nevertheless, her decision to really find her identity and talk about her degree of \\"exploration\\" was either a little boring, or perhaps too much information than I wanted to know. <br /> <br />I was also hoping to hear much more on the Cuban section. I think this relates more to the fact of the difficulty she had to face getting there; so in a way it makes some sense.  But to me that place so close to the US and more \\"unknown\\" would have created some interesting stories. <br /> <br />This book actually reminded me of another book I read by a journalist named Jan Wong.  The book is called \\"Red China Blues\\", and is very similar but I would have to say it's better (even though it focuses only on China).  If you liked this book I would recomend that one as well, and I would easily recommend this book to anyone interested in a light travelgoue read.	2005-06-06

"THE" picture of apathy	Goncharev tells the tale of a Russian gentleman, who has given up and resorted to slothfulness.  An old friend comes to visit appaled at his condition, and is unaware of some other people who come by to take advantage of him.  His friend tries to convince him to (if anything) get out of bed!  Oblomov ends up in a chance meeting with a woman, and it might bring him the motivation he needs to get up and perhaps live his life. <br /> <br />Everyone can \\"relate\\" to Oblomov in this tale, the picture painted of the cobwebs in the hall, the powerless to care of what is going, can hit us all at some time.  That is what really makes this book so great, you get a fantastic sense of feeling for the main character. <br /> <br />Secondly the novel turns into a love story but it does not go into overt sappyness, and actually bounces back and forth toying with the participants.  I got an amazing sense of wanting to know what would happen to the characters in this book, you really feel for them, and Oblomov's pain in dealing with it. <br /> <br />Finally Goncharev does not go for a simple neatly wrapped up ending.  Any other book would have been but the author was much smarter than that.  With the last sentence I closed this book feeling I truly lived the life of these people.  That's when I knew I read a fantastic book. <br /> <br />I only deduct one star (and somewhat grudgingly I might add), for just a \\"little\\" bit of overwordyness with the prose between the two lovers.  Other than that, hey... I can't wait to read this again sometime!	2005-06-06

I only bothered to read this through the first chapter, and then with discussing the book with about 3 other people I knew reading it, we all came to the conclusion that is was pretty dam bad. <br /> <br />I would say that just from the first chapter that this book has NOTHING to do with the book of Oz or has an insight into making a \\"alternate\\" universe based on the classic tale.  This is a book written by someone with an over-active imagination who could just put in whatever pie-in-the-sky idea he could come up with.  It is as if I could re-write Treasure Island and introduce giant robots that terrorize the pirates or something idiotic as such.  On top of that the author has obvious sexual 'issues'.  Don't ask me about his sexual references that are peppered in within just the fist 50 pages..  they are disturbing.. <br /> <br />If you want to read a GOOD alternate tale on a classic somewhat children's story, I suggest you read either The Tao of Pooh, or the Te of Piglet.  Those are fantastic compared to this stupid dreck.	2005-06-01

While I have only read Fever Pitch, and only seen High Fidelity on film, my main foray into \\"How To Be Good\\" was incredibly satisfying. <br /> <br />I thought Hornby took a lot of chances with this book writing from the mindset of a female, and also from a very flawed character.  The lifestyle portrait he describes of a falling apart married couple and the subsequent odd epiphany of her husband made for an ingenious story.  A guy like DJ Goodnews is not a common stereotyped character you just find lying around in every book you come across. <br /> <br />There were sections that had me howling when I read it.  I think what stood out the most and made this story unique was the way Hornby really nails what I would call \\"the liberal nightmare\\".  In this book a character forces himself to live by his morals, and finds that while his wife in 'principal' has always felt this way and supportive of those ideas, she is abhored by the fact that now she is forced to put up or shut up on those beliefs or face constant consternation. <br /> <br />The ending is great, it's flawed, on purpose for a reason.  We are all fragile and flawed in our beliefs and mistakes life is imperfect.  Enjoy!	2005-05-23

The simple narration was colourful and great, and the descriptions of the American and English friends frolicking through the cafes and restaurants left me stunk of wine, and merriment.  Reading this book made my drunk just by all the booze they were consuming.    Nevertheless, I didn't feel this novel take off until they arrived in Spain.  Brett is a character that is for sure, but everyone else seems relegated to supporting parts.  I kind of was hoping the story would tell a litte bit more about them.    I did enjoy the book but only in places, and I also feel that the book seems a bit dated.  But it's a good read no doubt. Yes I liked it.	2005-05-16

I could not care for any of them or what would happen to them.  Phillip's manages to write well at times, but I could not feel involved for these spoiled kids who were just in the prime of their adult youth in an exciting place.  At that time in my life I would have killed to been where they were at the time. <br /> <br />Also one of the only interesting and well written characters is hardly in the book at all, and that was John's editor at the newspaper.  I was actually hoping to hear more from him but he was rarely used in the story. <br /> <br />In a way this is a good first effort, but I think Phillp's just needs to write about something else.  The title for this book is really misleading as well, and would better be served naming it Budapest.	2005-05-16

And like every Everyman book, you got your nice binding and tassle, what more could be asked for???! <br /> <br />I figured I'd go through the stories one by one <br /> <br />THE STEEPE - Probably one of the most poetic and dreamy stories I have ever read.  I really enjoyed the scenes and the way Chekhov describes the countryside as a young boy travels along a cart running into many characters.  Pure poetry. <br /> <br />THE DUEL - One of the most popular duel stories and scenes (not counting Hero of Our Time, or The Idiot) in all of Russian literature.  A great microcosom of 2 individuals who end up resorting to pistols. <br /> <br />THE STORY OF AN UNKNOWN MAN - It is mentioned in the introduction that this is one Chekhov's least known stories.  And it's too bad cause this one was EASILY MY FAVORITE suprisingly.  A spy infiltrates a house as a servant, and through the course of knowing the inhabitants and the people who frequent the home, he develops a different mindset to his original agenda. <br /> <br />THREE YEARS - I found this still entertaining but it was my least favorite of the 5. <br /> <br />MY LIFE - Is a great story of a man renounces wealth and social position for a life of manual labor, but it's the conflict he has with his father over it that creates some great writing that Chekhov handles masterfully. <br /> <br />I was very pleased with the content of this addition, and I massively enjoyed Chekhov as a writer.  He has some great stuff, and this collection is just the perfect thing.	2005-05-11

Khaled Hosseini's novel about a young boys coming of age in Afghanistan is one part ingenious and well developed, the other part trashy and predictable. <br /> <br />His tales and writing of Afghanistan at the beginning of a young boy, is greatly colored and peppered with imagination.  There is much to picture as the narration weaves a great portrait and a sad story of two children. <br /> <br />However, (as another reviewer has mentioned already) when the boy grows up and moves to America, the book goes downhill.. and goes downhill... FAST. <br /> <br />As the main character returns to Afghanistan his travels become practically farcical, and a run in with an \\"old friend\\" was just WAY too much to be believed.  That as far as I was concerned was pathetic.  The author himself also throws in a little bit of self indulgence since the main character is a writer as well, and hints about what he has written and his success fall into the story and become distracting.  They are totally unnecessary. <br /> <br />In the end it's an uneven book, but I can't say the book is completely horrible because the first half of it is really good.	2005-05-10

What else can I say here that hasn't already been said?  There are passages in this book and chapters that have some of the most unique writing I have ever come across.  The characters are so litteraly vivid that the amount of detail in describing their thoughts and conversations practically puts you in their head as they speak.<br /><br />It's also amazing how almost half the book is just background and conversations (fascinating they are), and the plot doesn't come out until much later, and then when it does it certainly leaves you hanging on every word.  You really get an insight into how these characters think, live, and breathe.  I still keep thinking of them days after finishing this book.  It is as if you can see yourself in all of them in some way or another.<br /><br />Remember a pound of nuts, ask if hell has hooks if there is no ceiling, know the grand inquisitor, try to recognize the devil, find the balance between mans hatred and spirituality with god.<br /><br />Read this book at some point in your life before you die.

Rosenbuam points to America as being the leader and champion of exported culture (regardless if this a good thing or not is not the point), and the cause of a dumbing down of cinema all over the world, as great works get pushed to the side seemingly never meant to be appreciated. <br />  <br /> One of the best things that comes across in the book is Rosenbaum's passion. Simply put he waxes poeticaly talking back to the days of his past and finding films on his own, be it an odd trek to see John Carpenters 'The Thing', or about his education with film in his years in Paris, or his insight about how the festival of Cannes has chaned, to his reaction of a critic during the first hour of a seven hour film masterpiece (the name right now escapes me and I don't have the book with me to quote the name it starts with an 'S'). The other side is filled with not so much venom as 'concern' if I could say with the concept of how America is not getting the film education and greatness it deserves. <br />  <br /> He highlights this in several ways, such as his dicussions about Miramax (He points out that if Miramax gets a film chances of you seeing it are even LESS than if they didn't, and if you do chances are it's going to be chopped/altered in someway), the myth of independent film (he points out that Sundance and Telluride is just a cover and is in no way an independent showcase), and how most film critics are more in-debt to their papers and editors who call the shots (he highlights that with one critic as his popularity grew his word count and column got less real-estate space). <br />  <br /> It's an absolutlely FASCINATING look at cinema and the state that it is heading in. This is a MUST have film book if you are passionate about film. <br /><br /> Some criticism's of the book though come from some of Rosenbaums overly-long wordy sentences, and his use of examples with films that can be for the most part with many first time readers, unknown. When he starts using films that he has seen for his arguments chances are you are not going to guess where he is coming from due to the fact you haven't seen the films yourself. But he certainly does point you in some interesting directions. However, with the films he does point out that you may know you get exactly where he is coming from. <br />  <br /> Secondly, even though the book is merely only 4 years old, it is a little dated. Rosenbaum likes to bring up the obscurity of director Ozu (one of my personal favs) as a problem, however there has lately been a renaisance of his work and he is already starting to become quite a well known name (Criterion DVD releases are already proving that, and a recent tribute festival that I saw that came through DC). <br />  <br /> Even with all that said, the book is a fascinating insight into the realm of how cinema is marketed and distributed to the mass American public. Rosenbaum throws in examples of dumbed down culture, coroporate marketing, distributor strangleholding and numerous other things that will keep you intrigued about the workings of the film process. <br />  <br /> Great book, ecspecialy if you are a film nut like myself.	2004-07-28

I bought this book with the intention of reading it for a 2 week vacation period, but started reading it before I left and COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!  I finished it in about 4 days.  And that's the joy of this book, besides its massive amount of information it is never dull or confusing to read, but majorly entertaining as Remar creates every scenario you may face when shopping for a new/used vehicle.<br />I can't wait to use the knowledge in this book to my advantage I've never been so excited about what I know and what others don't about the whole dealership experience.  Suddenly terms as 'water' at a dealership, and 'in the bucket' will keep you empowered.<br />DO NOT BUY A CAR WITHOUT READING THIS BOOK FIRST!!!!!  GET IT NOW!!!	2002-05-13
US	49189532	R1860YZ3MVBKHJ	1861004060	984071922	Beginning JavaScript	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Not bad	Well another Wrox addition....<br />I got more than enough from this book to give me a good intro to JavaScript.  There are a lot of exercises and tutorial work to do that is consistent with the concepts, probably what appeals to me most about Wrox books.<br />The first few intro chapters are REALLY dry and basic..  a veteran programmer can easily skip them over or cruise pretty quickly through them at least.  But the more middle chapters are nice and meaty.  The books discusion of Netscape vs IE is a bit outdated considering..  Most of that I just ignored.  And I would steer clear of ever wanting to use expressions.  It is a beginner book and rightfuly so.  Many of the later chapters I just ignored and found I had it covered in other publications.  Guess I'll be buy Pro books from now on from Wrox unless it's some language I've never used (like C#)..<br />But it's a good and I can say that I have found plenty of useful tips, and concepts and new ideas.  And anything that helps me in my job is more than welcome.  Definatly recommended	2002-02-27
US	49189532	R38DS7L2VYQVG9	1861003064	43199931	Beginning Visual Basic SQL Server 7.0	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Not bad	Thearon Willis's approach is pretty straight forward, and that's what I like.  In short this book gets a solid positive review and has minor peeves.<br />In short this is a great intro to SQL server 7.  Good use of explaining triggers, and stored procedures.  Most important the examples are REAL WORLD BUSINESS examples that you can use.  So many other books get you to do things that are totaly useless.<br />While I wouldn't design and interface like he did, or make the tables, as such, and I did find his stored procedures a bit overly lengthy, it's still a great book to get started on and has a lot of usefull stuff.  Knowing VB helps but not neccesary and is of course not concentrated on either..<br />solid 4, Another good Wrox book.	2001-11-09

Using my experience and a different guide (New Riders MCSD VB 6, my review is on this site) I figured I'd research some extra material.<br />This book I discovered in my local city library by a fluke so I figured hey great I can use this and it will cost nothing.  Now having read it here's what I can say.<br />The books organization seems fine, but it condenses too much information in a very unuseful manner.  It reads like a very bad MSDN.  Sections in the book talk about stuff that you will never even see on the exam.  However I was glad to finally find out what the hell Zorder was for.<br />Secondly the book is missing things on the exam that you will need.  There is absolutely no mention of Visual Source Safe and how to use it.  You need to know VSS for the exam and this book doesn't even cover it.  Also too many of the topics are lightly covered ecspecially the section on deployment which is a HUGE part of the exam.<br />Thirdly, there are practically no exercises for you to do which is bad, cause that's the only way you will really let a concept sink in and actually 'get it'.<br />What I did find good was the questions, which I can honestly say were TOUGH!  The exam at the end was a good and extrememly hard and made me think (and it pissed me off).  <br />I haven't taken the exam again yet, but I can say that the only thing I got out of the book were the sample questions.  If I pass it again it won't be because of this book.<br />So overall I am EXTREMELY glad I did not have to buy this, and I can recommend solidly that you don't either.	2001-03-31
US	49189532	R1LINLITJLLOS5	0735700028	131550490	MCSD Training Guide: Visual Basic 6 Exams (The Training Guide Series)	Books	2	40	49	N	N	READ THIS REVIEW IT WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE!!!!!!!!!	I am a VB developer who has worked with VB for about 3-4 years.  So I decided to pick this book in terms of what it covered since it had both VB exams in the MCSD curriculum.<br />There was no need for me to get certified really.  I just felt like doing it. So what can I tell you about this book???  I think it would be best to describe it in relating to you my test taking experience.  I decided to take the 70-175 Distributed test first.<br />I failed.  I got 685 and needed 728 (failed by 4.3%).<br />I then decied a month or so later to take the Desktop 70-176 exam<br />I failed.  I got 700 and needed 714 (failed by 1.4%).<br />So how did the book help me??  I'll put it to you this way best in pros and cons.<br />PRO:<br />1) This is a great reference book in finding out properties of controls and what is covered for the exam, and some techniques.<br />2) It is organized very well.<br />3) You will learn things in VB (as I did) that you may never had needed, or never knew existed ( and you know what?? some of that is pretty COOL!).<br />CON: (there are MANY)<br />1) If you do not know VB at all, or god forbid programming you will not have a hope in hell of understanding this book.<br />2) The book is CHOC full of errors.  Even the error list that you can get from the publishers web site doesn't cover all the mistakes<br />  2a)  Bad code in the examples that is just plain wrong or incomplete.<br />  2b)  Incorrect answers in the back of the book that either have the wrong answer highlighted (A when the explanation is answer B), or stuff that is plain wrong such as in Exercise 20.4 (Compiler Constants CONTRADICTS the fast fact for exam 70-176 page 1033, 'A value for a compiler option set in the command line overrides the value set in code' WRONG try the exercise!)<br />Now tech manuals are known for their mistakes, but if you need to know something as the CORRECT answer, and it is not given or worse WRONG, then you start having doubts about what you are learning.  Thenumerous amount of errors in this book are INEXSCUSABLE!!!<br />3)  Many of the examples have POOR instructions (Chapter 13 is notorious).  I could figure out pretty much all of them, but if you don't know VB you will have a VERY hard time getting it.<br />4)  Would it hurt to have the source code on the CD!!  (they probably didn't do this cause they knew the examples provided were half a**)<br />5)  The practice questions and exams fail CONSTANTLY to mention whether you should select more than one answer!  You get the idea  from then on that other questions are not neccesarily a one answer question.  It is clear on the exam (you will get either SELECT ALL THAT APPLY, OR Select 2, 3 etc..)<br />6)  The book makes NO NOTE of WHAT YOU NEED TO USE THIS BOOK! This has to be The ONLY tech book I have ever bought that DOES not tell you what you need (in terms of software).  You will need  SQL to do some of the exercises in Chapter 9, and you should do some of the exercises related to MTS with NT.  If you don't have them, you are leaving out important information that you need to know in the exam.  Did I mention you'd need at least VB professional???  Luckily I have all these things.<br />7)  For exam 70-175 this book is too weak in areas of n-tier concepts and the MTS is not covered good enough.  This book is not really geared towards this exam.<br />8)  For exam 70-176 this book is weak on PDW.  This book however, is geared more towards the Desktop exam.<br />9)  The practice CD exams, Study cards etc.. have stuff that is NOT EVEN COVERED IN THE TEXT.  You tell me in the book in Chapter 3 where they discuss Drag Drop events..<br />10)  Many of the explanations to the answers in the practice test s on the CD examples tell you nothing in relation to the question.<br />11)  Due to the numerous amount of controls and properties of controls in VB you can NOT memorize them all and the book CAN'T cover them all.<br />That's all I can think of off the top of my head.  Other reviews I have read here, have expressed faults that I think are reliable as well.<br />So is my review biased cause i failed???  No...  The simple reality is that I failed these exams for one simple reason.<br />I DO NOT.. and WILL NOT... remember anal things like, what setting is on what, tab under what option, under what menu item. OR EVEN WORSE.. What are all the parameters names, and values for event X  (just one eg.).<br />Any programmer/developer who does this is NUTS!  You show me something in VB and you say to me 'what is this'  I either say it is blah, or I don't know but I'll check MSDN and get you your answer.  I do not say, oh the setting on tab X under menu Y does this if blah blah blah.  Give me a break...<br />There were also questions on the exam that I WOULD NEVER do in my applications (like use the Data Environment designer),  so of course I don't know the names of all the events for a connection object and I am smart enough to know that I WOULD NEVER PUT CODE THERE IF YOU PUT A BULLET TO MY HEAD.  Also I debug my program only a certain way.. thus questions on Watches I could care less.<br />So you think I am bitter.  Well no I am not (seriously).  Yes there were questions on the exams (both of them) that I had no idea what they were talking about.  And I think some of the theory oriented stuff (I seem to get murdered on the Establishing the Development Environment section(s)), I look at as not applicaple to the REAL WORLD!  Sure this is the optimal solution.. but your boss says, we don't have the cash or I WANT it this way period.  I think this clouds my judgement on these questions.<br />So I can not recommend this book cause the cons are just too numerous.  The best advice I can leave with you (if you are thinking of VB certification) is the following:<br />&quot;Do not get certified in something you do not know&quot;.<br />Ecspecially if you do not know VB.  Make sure that you have worked with ALL the concepts in this book fully in a real world environment and you wont even need a book to pass the exams.<br />And I know there's people out there who can just retain information and memorize stuff and pass tests like it is nothing.  But it wont help you if you can memorize everything pass this test, and then get planted in front of a terminal and someone says make THIS.  You will be screwed (or at least have to be retrained in what you supposedly already know).<br />There was someone here who posted that they had no knowledge of VB but passed both these exams.  Unless this person is a programmer in a different language, I find this a very FRIGHTENING prospect.  I know that I would never work for such an organization (or said individual) who matched the above description.<br />Hope this review has been helpful.  <br />PS.  Buy good tutorial books on VB and make stuff, don't study/buy this book if you want to pass the exam.	2000-12-02

I have used this book a lot to develop ASP pages.<br />The book however, keeps  discussing topics within different OS's though (it switches from NT to  Win9X) when needed.  This makes things kind of hard to do if you don't have  the right OS's to do the exercises so some chapters you can only  read...<br />But is good and I would recommend it..

US	49189532	R2JZ4JVQENCLRV	1902745043	9198430	Learn to Program Objects With Visual Basic 6	Books	4	25	26	N	N	If you are a beginer GREAT if you are more advanced...ehh...	I give this book a good rating for what it is.  This book is basicaly an  INTRO book in how to code with objects in VB and an introductory to some  OOP concepts.<br />This books strong points are the following:<br />1. It is very  easy to follow 2. It is CHEAP 3. The examples are concise and make for easy  understanding 4. The author PUMMELS the concepts in your head until YOU GET  IT (which by the way he does excellently) 5. There are virtually no errors  in this book (most of them are spelling errors in the prose) and that is  RARE in a computer book.<br />So for this reason it is quite good.  Now what's  bad<br />1.  Filled with lots of scenic padding (you know what I mean if  you've read it!) 2.  Examples are very small 3.  Could contain LOTS more  (such as COM ) 4.  This project is WAY to small.  I only WISH in the years  of my experience with VB projects that an application would be this small  and simple...  No way...<br />However the reasons it lacks through the above,  is because this was not what the author was achieving for, and not the  audience he was reaching out to.<br />The book says it is for the Begginer to  Intermediate level.  I would say this book is STRICTLY beginerish in fact  it is even intro.  Intermediate and advanced programmers (ecspecialy those  who have worked in VB) will find this book too laid back, and over  simplified (You'll be sitting there saying 'OK I get it now, show me  something more involved [this is what I was saying]').  It's as if the  other students in the class are holding you back because of their skill  level.<br />I bought this book because I have worked with VB for some time but  never forced myself to learn its classes.  This has to do mostly for 2  reasons.  One, I have been able to achieve everything I need without it.   Two,  Vb is NOT a true object oriented language.  I learned all about OOP  in school programming with C++ and some Powerbuilder.  Thus if I was going  to do OOP I would not use VB.  Also this book had very good reviews.  I  have noticed that most of the people who gave favourable reviews about the  book with high praise, were virtualy in love with the author and worked  from all his other books.  This book though did what it needed to do for  me, but it took way too much time to do it cause of all the padding.  But  it is good cause Smiley hammers the concepts until you get IT!  Like one  reviewer said, &quot;If you don't get OOP [in a VB context] from this book  there is no hope for you&quot;.  No doubt!<br />A lot of the stuff for me, was  just un-locking all that old stuff I had burried in the back of my skull  from years ago at school, and recognizing the VB syntax for its  classes.<br />But the stuff is GOOD and the book is VERY usefull.  It's just a  little too theory based to.  What Smiley hints about the real world  [regarding application development] is all good BUT when you hit the cement  for awhile you really start seeing what it takes to make an app get in  [politics etc..] and all the other B.S.  that throws everything you learned  in school OUT THE WINDOW!!<br />This book is perfect for someone who is either  learning to program (meaning they have had NO formal training in it) and is  using VB but hasn't learned classes yet.<br />This book is NOT for people who  no nothing about programming.  You will probably have a hard time with it.   Also if you are VB experienced and know some OOP this book is missing  MEAT!! and it is NOT for you either.  You will get good stuff from it, but  you will want more..<br />So that's my final thoughts to summarize this one.   EXCELLENT if you are new to VB and want to learn it's OOP, LACKING if you  are an advanced VB programmer (or advanced programmer in general).  The  rating reflects the book for what it is: 4 out of 5.<br />Also if your really  interested in doing OOP, learn a true OO language like C++ or Java.	2000-09-12

Even though I have been playing around in VB for some time, I always go  back to begining books.  You always find some little tip or trick, that you  haven't heard of which you find useful.  In this book there are quite a  few.<br />However, some problems are that the book has quite a good chunk of  errors in it BUT... the publishers web site does have downloadable code and  explanation of the errors.<br />Only beef is that I have yet to see the book  make a SOLID bullet proof example.  In this book you can see that he  doesn't cover all the problems that can occour with an app, (you can tweak  it yourself I suppose).  But hey, if you are trying to teach someone how to  make an interface make it BULLET PROOF so that when u go into industry you  can do it right, not half way!<br />Good coverage with the subject, but could  have been better and the book is not a total loss with a lot of useful  info.	2000-08-11

I can honestly say after doing about 80% of the examples in this book,  that I found only about 20% of the stuff useful.  And of all the stuff I  learned I can honestly say that it did not make my understanding of API's  more clear.<br />To me API is something you have to spend some time with.  And  it is hard cause unlike picking some new control and just figuring out what  it does by its properties and methods, API's aren't something you can  quickly grasp (IMHO) by playing with them.<br />I didn't like the 'I will  explain what all this does later', concept either as one reviewer  mentioned.  If your going to write out tonnes of code explain it all before  you move on.  This book doesn't do that.  ALSO DON'T throw pages of code  and more pages and then explain what it all does.<br />DO IT IN SMALL CHUNKS!!  Any developer who writes tonnes and tonnes of code and then tests his/her  program is nuts.  Take it in small steps.  The book doesn't do this and I  feel that was its greatest fault.<br />I'd write this huge routine and sure it  would work, but I'd be saying to myself &quot;what do these 2 lines here at  the beggining with the API call do exactly&quot;..  Then I am coding more  and then the concept is atempted to be explained to me in its entirity..  And I am sitting there &quot;What the hell did I just do?&quot;<br />Well  that's my 2 cents. The good thing is source code is available from the  publishers web site, and what errors there are in the book are easy to  see.. nothing huge (that is unless you are really new to VB then u  shouldn't be using this book first). However, the mutex example was VERY  helpful and I have it in one application already.  I know what it does but  I don't really understand its mechanics...  And I think that's how I feel  about this book in the nutshell.<br />Got some usefull code (not a lot) but  API is still a mystery to me....  There's propably something better out  there..	2000-08-10

You are not bogged down on  theory and spend most of the time coding at actualy writing than reading.   You can EASILY finish this book in a week.<br />Very few errors in coding  (Some books I have had were horrid! )<br />Bad points:<br />Book does not follow  naming convention standards for variables (minor point)<br />Not a book for  people who want to do a full blown system with a lot of hutzpah (hey were  talking Access here anyway), or Advanced features of coding in  Access.<br />Relatively basic and touches only very few advanced features and  coding (eg. Automation, Active X) or not at all.<br />In the end, good  outweighs the bad.  As a developer though I needed more that was the  drawback.  But if you want to get a quick fresher on Access Basic (I say  ACCESS basic cause Access coding is NOT like VB Coding even though they  appear similar).<br />If you're looking to code in Access and have little or  no experience than this book is perfect for you, however I wouldn't  recomend this book as a basis for learning VB.  From then you can move on  to the Access97 developers handbook published by Sybex written by Litwin,  Getz, Gilbert for a good reference book.	2000-07-12
