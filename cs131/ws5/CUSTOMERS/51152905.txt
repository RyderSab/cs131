US	51152905	R2YCVLX3R925FE	B00005WJ51	947740521	Orn	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Survival of the Fittest	This is the middle book of the Viscous Circle of Man and Manta set. The first book in the set, Omnivore, introduces both the three main human characters, Cal, Veg, and Aquilon, and a set of rather unique beings, the mantas, who are intelligent, single footed, one-eyed, and members of the fungoid family. Reading the first book of this set prior to this one is not totally required, though it would help with the beginning of this book, which is a direct continuation from the end of Omnivore.<br /><br />Cal, Veg, Aquilon, and four of the mantas are sent on a mission to a newly discovered world (via a transfer mechanism whose operation is not yet completely understood) to determine the world's suitability for human habitation. Cal quickly determines that this world is not 'new', but is rather our Earth of some sixty-five million years ago, the Paleocene age, just after the age of dinosaurs and the beginning of the age of mammals. But within this world there is also something that doesn't quite fit that age: a large, intelligent, flightless bird, Orn.<br /><br />Orn is definitely the best part of this book, as he doesn't think like we do, but rather navigates his world via 'racial memory' - built into his genes are those experiences of all his ancestors that have happened frequently enough to be so imprinted. This is an idea that most biologists think is very unlikely, but it certainly makes for a very different life form whose actions and 'thoughts' are nevertheless very understandable.<br /><br />There is an inevitable meeting between Orn and the humans, occurring in a physically isolated enclave where some of the dinosaurs of the late Cretaceous have managed to survive. The interactions between all of these beings is properly driven by each being's character, from Veg as a confirmed vegetarian to Cal's emphasis on logic and survival of the fittest, and only near the end of the book does it take on larger aspects as the Earth authorities try to exert control over the group.<br /><br />Thematically, this book is a further investigation, which was started in Omnivore, into the morality of killing others to ensure your own survival, here looked at both from the point of view of evolutionary demands and on the individual level, from herbivore to omnivore. At times this book gets a little too bogged down in scientific details (such as the differences between various classes of mollusks), and the portrayed mind-set of the Earth authorities seems a little too harsh to be totally believable, but in general this is a good action-adventure set in environment where dinosaurs are not only believable but are properly portrayed in both their strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />Anthony closes the book with an appendix that defines his own thoughts on how and why the dinosaurs died out. Written before the confirmation of the iridium layer and the Yucatan crater, his ideas still make a good addendum to the catastrophic theory of their demise, even though he specifically denies 'catastrophe' as the primary cause.<br /><br />This is probably the best of the three books of the triptych, greatly enlivened by the unique viewpoint that Orn brings to it, and is a far more serious effort than his Xanth books. Written very early in his career, it shows the kind of inventiveness and good understanding of human motivation that makes for enlightening reading.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)er the group.  <br /> <br />Thematically, this book is a further investigation, which was started in Omnivore, into the morality of killing others to ensure your own survival, here looked at both from the point of view of evolutionary demands and on the individual level, from herbivore to omnivore.

This book helps illustrate that point, as we find Howard Christian trying to develop a modern day version of a mammoth via DNA cloning, but in looking for source DNA material stumbles across not only a frozen mammoth, but a frozen man right beside it wearing a wristwatch and with a briefcase that just might be a time machine.<br /><br />Howard hires mathematician Matt Wright, who has some new ideas in the area of time travel, to fix and/or duplicate that machine. Wright's investigation into the machine's operation eventually leads to a real trip back in time, for himself and Susan Morgan, an elephant handler who was hired by Christian to handle the result of the DNA cloning effort. The result of that trip, and the mayhem it does to modern Los Angeles, forms the balance of this story.<br /><br />Each of the three characters is fairly well delineated, more than well enough to carry the story and drive the conflict. But there is a fourth character, a baby mammoth, whose story is told separately in interstitial chapters (styled as a young children's story), that actually may be the best portion of this book, as through this story the past of 15,000 years ago comes alive - the described environment, animals, climate, and behaviors of the mammoth herd all contribute to a sense of 'being there'.<br /><br />Not so good is the basic plot, as it almost seems as if the story line was constructed with Hollywood in mind, with certain scenes just made for 'trailers', and too little work being done to really delve into the paradoxes that time travel (at the macro level) almost necessarily entails, even though such items drive the final resolution of the story. Varley has done much better in this area previously, and this work suffers by comparison with that earlier work and also in comparison to other works that have dealt with time travel, from Heinlein's \\"All You Zombies\\"  to Asimov's The End of Eternity.<br /><br />The net is that this is a good entertainment level novel, well written and engaging, with some good insights into the environment of the past, but has little to offer in terms of deeper meaning or any new twists on this type of story.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)rlier work and also in comparison to other works that have dealt with time travel, from Heinlein's \\"All You Zombies\\"  to Asimov's The End of Eternity.

US	51152905	R3RHEVD68PX5NR	0671318373	601574523	The Paladin	Books	3	8	11	N	Y	Being Honest with Yourself	This book is something of an oddity, written as if it were a fantasy, but it could have just as easily have been placed into the 'historical' novel camp, with just some minor changes in the described locale and time, as there are no magical happenings, no flights of fancy, nothing that could not have happened in the real world.<br /><br />The plot line is quite simple. A young girl comes to beg training in sword fighting from a legendary master who has 'retired' to a mountain hermitage so she can use the acquired skills to exact revenge on a lord who has desecrated her homeland and family.  The master, former advisor to the old Emperor, is actually in exile, forbidden on pain of death from ever returning to court, and has settled into a simple life of meditation and taking care of his old war-horse, and not wishing to get involved with anyone, or to return to intrigues of the court. But the girl finally manages to force the master to accept her as an apprentice, and her training begins.<br /><br />The interaction between these two characters during this portion of the work is excellent, as each displays traits of stubbornness that make for continuous conflict between the two. And the conflict extends beyond the physical training, into the realm of why one should or shouldn't take action against perceived wrongs, what purpose an individual's life has, the value of honesty both to self and others. This is well done, and I felt that I really got to know and admire these two individuals, as each has traits that are worth emulating.<br /><br />But the second half of this novel, when the two take to the road to actually accomplish the girl's original objective, is not nearly as good, dropping down to a standard swash-buckling adventure novel, with action a-plenty (and somewhat confusing as the reader is hit with many minor characters and place names that are difficult to keep track of), but almost none of the fine philosophy and character interaction of the first portion. The ending is quite predictable, and left me with a disappointed feeling, as I could see this could have been much better.<br /><br />Cherryh used something of the same type of plot line and character interaction in her Cuckoo's Egg, but there the resolution of the story held up to the premises and promise of its beginnings, making for a much better story, and I would recommend that book in preference to this one. Read this one only if you are desperate for more Cherryh to read.<br /><br />---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)predictable, and left me with a disappointed feeling, as I could see this could have been much better.

Within the framework of these books, he managed to effectively tie in just about all of his previous fiction work, through an idea he first played with in the short story \\"Elsewhen\\" published in 1941, that time is not a single dimension, but rather, just like the spatial dimensions, time is actually three separate dimensions. This book is the first of these \\"World as Myth\\" books, and naturally has to not only introduce this concept of time, but also a gadget that allows one to travel along each of the axes composing it.<br /><br />The gadget is the product of mathematics professor Jacob Burroughs, who invites one Zebadiah Carter to a university party under the mistaken impression that Zeb is one of the few other men in the world who can understand his mathematics (actually Zeb's cousin is the mathematical genius). Zeb meets Jacob's daughter D.T. (Deety) at the party, falls in love with her, and is in the process of leaving the party in order to marry her, along with her father and the party's host, Hilda Corners, when Jacob's duo-car explodes. Thus is formed the group that is the focus of this novel, two couples that are highly intelligent, resourceful, independent, and on the run from whomever (or whatever) blew up the car. They fix up Zeb's car (Gay Deceiver - a remarkable invention in her own right) with Jacob's whiz-bang gadget, and suddenly find themselves on a journey to some truly strange (and not so strange) places - as one of the time axes is the entry to all those universes that are created by fabulists (writers). Baum's Oz, Burrough's Barsoom (and Pelucidar), Niven's Ringworld, Smith's Lensman, Asimov's \\"Nightfall\\", and most especially Heinlein's own Time Enough for Love are all included, along with many others.<br /><br />But besides traveling to all these strange worlds, this is a story of character, as each of the four end up taking turns leading the group - and in so doing expose some radically different traits. There are some who have criticized Heinlein for only have one character type. This book explodes that myth. He has also been criticized for not writing very believable female characters, which is true to some degree (and especially in his early work), but the two women of this book should do much to dispel the notion that he couldn't write good women. He has also been excoriated as something of misogynist. Once again, this book should disabuse the critics of this idea, as there are some clear thoughts and ideas expressed here from both sides of the gender rift that put both women and men into their 'proper' place (sometimes hilariously so).<br /><br />The mathematics presented here is solid. Those who flunked their geometry and trigonometry classes need not feel threatened, as this material is safely skippable, but it is nice to have a novel that gets these kinds of details correct and doesn't assume that the reader is a dunce. And if I could ever get my hands on a vehicle even half as good as Gay Deceiver, I'd probably die of delight.<br /><br />But perhaps most important is the look this book takes at the idea of solipsism, a prime ingredient here where everything must be considered, in some fashion, a fantasy (one person's reality being nothing more than a writer's dream in another universe), and within this framework a working out of what makes life worth living (what does it matter if you're only a figment of someone else's imagination?). The last chapter of this book has confused many people (including at least one famous critic), but it makes good sense when you really look at all the various 'shadow' character names (hint: anagrams and Robert Anson Heinlein).<br /><br />Throughout this book, there is a sense of fun and adventure (amidst all the heavy conversation), of kudos being paid to other authors (and it does help if the reader is familiar with the works cited here), of a recognition of the entire science fiction community and the fans that have added so much to the field. No, it doesn't have a definitive ending in the sense that most novels do, but merely points the way towards the further adventures of all sentient beings - and the rest of the World as Myth books.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)works cited here), of a recognition of the entire science fiction community and the fans that have added so much to the field.

At the same time, by investigating just what is important in life, it is uplifting and insightful.<br /><br />The story tracks former astronaut Richard Baedecker, who is plagued by feelings of not doing anything meaningful in his post-NASA job, a divorce and an estranged son. The son has taken up with an Indian guru, seeking something he is not getting from his famous father, while Richard cannot seem to find a way to re-connect with his son, but does manage to connect with his son's semi-girlfriend. That connection leads him on a search for what is meaningful for him, from recollections of the items he left on the moon as a permanent mark on that world, to finding the magic of high places. His final actions of this book show that he has found, at least for him, some answers to the meaning of life, answers that will resonate with most readers.<br /><br />This story is told very stylistically, with clean descriptions, very quiet actions, and with quick flashes backward and forward in time - potentially a confusing method of telling a story, but Simmons brings this off nicely. Richard's character is nicely portrayed, building on his recollections of his past exploits and his current interactions with those around him to show a fully realized man, one who has many doubts, fears, and sometimes moments of happiness. The characters around him, while not shown in as great a depth, are more than adequately developed, especially Dave, his former NASA crewmate. Perhaps the best item about this book is that all the characters and themes are developed by showing, not telling or pontificating.<br /><br />The dream of space flight is here, still dazzling, but it is shown in today's light, not center-focus, almost just a background to Richard's story. And as such, I found some of this heavy going, for regardless of how realistic this portrayal is, for me that dream has not died, and if I can help it, it never will. Perhaps this book can help galvanize people into once more putting real effort into making this dream a true, commonplace, and daily reality.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)nd some of this heavy going, for regardless of how realistic this portrayal is, for me that dream has not died, and if I can help it, it never will.

Such knowledge is dangerous: everyone wants what he has, and many are not too scrupulous about how they get it. From page one we are dropped into the action, as Ben is attacked while diving, then chased from his laboratory, then `kidnapped' at his boat. His friends, Haley Walthers  and Sam Wintripp (of his earlier books Overfall and Unacceptable Risk), are quickly drawn into the action.<br /><br />The action continues non-stop, with Sgt Frick as the ultimate nemesis, a near psychopath who has managed to get into a powerful position as temporary head of the local police force, tries everything to capture the three and learn Ben's secrets. In fact, the action is so non-stop that it becomes a problem - there is no stopping for reflection, little time for full character development, a sense of highly risky decisions made by the various people without a good enough look at their natures to see why they are making such decisions, and some of the events take on an aura of improbability. This would certainly make a good action movie, but perhaps for the book a little more 'quiet time' would have helped. But the action sequences themselves are well thought-out, and can certainly provide both thrills and frights to the reader.<br /><br />The science in this book is real (up to the final revelations, where it definitely enters the realm of science fiction), frightening and exhilarating, and points to exciting areas of research that just may end up benefiting everyone. But unfortunately a lot this material is dumped on the reader in snippets and blocks that are not very well integrated with the story. Also, there are places where some good editing could have been used - there are occasional instances of fractured syntax and inappropriate word use, restatements of an item mentioned just a few pages previously, and other such glitches that should have been caught.<br /><br />Thematically, however, this book does well in showing a scientist who not only discovers something new, but thinks about what the consequences of his discoveries are, and actually does something (however wrong-headed or Pollyannaish) to manage those consequences.<br /><br />Not a thinking man's book (unless you actually do a little more reading about the scientific aspects of it), but entertaining, and will definitely fulfill your quota of 'action' for the day.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)integrated with the story.

Like most collections, the quality varies considerably from one story to the next.<br /><br />\\"Gulf\\" first appeared in the Nov-Dec 1949 issues of Astounding magazine, and is the best fleshed out story here. A novella, the first portion of this reads like a James Bond thriller (perhaps better), the action is fast paced and our hero's actions make sense. But it quickly becomes apparent that he is far more than an average man, in fact he is something of a superman in terms of intelligence, reaction time, and decision making, items which are not lost on an entire society of such individuals, who recruit and train him. Some of the science presented here about how such a group of people came to be and the methods used for training them will seem a little dubious to today's readers, and the moral points raised (is a superior being justified in eliminating, without recourse to the law, those he feel are a threat to his society?) might raise a few hackles, but this is still a fun, fast read that will make you do a little thinking. Kettle Bailey is introduced in this story, and it might be considered a prequel to his much later novel Friday, which dealt with some of the same moral issues. Like almost everything else he wrote, this story was tied into his Future History in his last books.<br /><br />\\"Elsewhen\\" is very minor Heinlein, with almost no characterization and very little plot. It originally appeared in Sept 1941 issue of Astounding (as by 'Caleb Saunders'), and clearly showed that Heinlein was still learning the craft of writing at that time. But it introduces the idea of time having multiple dimensions: the normal time flow, the 'parallel universe' branching time flow, and the 'time' dimension associated with author created universes. This was an idea Heinlein would return to in much greater depth (and much better written) in The Number of the Beast, the first of the 'World-as-Myth' books.<br /><br />\\"Lost Legacy\\" is the other long piece here, first appearing in the Oct 1941 issue of Super Science Stories (as by 'Lyle Monroe'). Here again the idea of 'supermen' is tackled, this time positing that in the 'unused' areas of the brain lie the capabilities for the paranormal - telepathy, telekinesis, levitation, etc; talents which have been 'lost' after the fall of Mu and Antlantis. This one is only fair - characterization is somewhat lacking (and the shown expectation level for women is definitely grounded in the '40s stereotype - something that showed up in a lot of Heinlein's work from this period), and the 'bad guys' motivations don't seem totally believable (though perhaps that's just me - I've never understood people whose main drive is power over others). The solution to the problem of training people to remember these hidden talents, though, is a good one. This story may have been a re-working of some ideas that first appeared in \\"Beyond Doubt\\", his only known fictional collaboration (with Elma Wentz), which appeared in April of 1941 (and which he referred to as one of his 'stinkeroos' - it is pretty bad).<br /><br />\\"Jerry was a Man\\" is perhaps the story of most relevance to today's world. First appearing in the Oct 1947 issue of Thrilling Wonder Stories, it is a world of genetic engineering marvels, from six-legged dogs and pint-sized flying horses to 'enhanced' monkeys - enhanced to the point that they have become a major factor in providing the labor for the 'dirty' jobs of society. The story is an investigation into just where the line can (or should) be drawn between 'animal' and 'man', couched in Heinlein's typical acid humor of court-room shenanigans, shysters, and money-hungry corporations.<br /><br />These stories are certainly not the best things Heinlein ever wrote, but there is surprisingly little dating to them other than the cultural attitudes of the day, and they still entertaining and in some cases very thought provoking.  Recommended for any Heinlein fan looking to see what he was capable of during his 'early' period outside of the Future History, and good for anyone who enjoys science fiction.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)s very thought provoking.

Kidnapped and marooned in this time period, Doyle is introduced to the underwold of that London, becoming a beggar who must hide from the sorcerer's disciples (and their ka's, replicas grown from the original's blood). Figuring out why he is object of such attention and determining what to do about it forms the balance of this work.<br /><br />The action is fast paced, the situation complex and in places appropriately horrific, the described environs of London and Egypt in that period very well done. Most of the characters were well drawn, from the ka Romany to Jackie the beggar, and their motivations and actions normally made good sense. Historically, this seems to be quite accurate in terms of known events, from the Duke of Monmouth's attempts to take the English crown to the known early life of Lord Byron. Some of the images and ideas of this book are excellent, from little four inch high men to a valid, believable werewolf. And it does provide an interesting explanation for some of Coleridge's visions.<br /><br />Where I had some problems with this work was with the character of Doyle himself as he changes from something of an ivory-tower milquetoast to a man of action and derring-do, as the change just did not strike me as totally believable, even given that he was almost forced into such action or die. In some of the later stages of the book, I also had trouble following just who was who, especially for some of the minor characters (why this confusion exists is one of the mainstays of the plot).<br /><br />But most disappointing to me was that Powers basically copped out on providing any answer to the philosophical question that time travel almost necessarily entails: if you go back in time, are all your actions from that point on totally pre-determined (else history would change), is there some wiggle room for self-determination if the actions were never documented; or can history be changed and a new universe born? How he managed to not answer this forms a somewhat surprising coda to the main action, good in its own right, but still left me feeling a little cheated.<br /><br />Still, a strong action novel, well researched, and very different from most books that fall under the umbrella of `time-travel'.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)of the mainstays of the plot). <br /> <br />But most disappointing to me was that Powers basically copped out on providing any answer to the philosophical question that time travel almost necessarily entails: if you go back in time, are all your actions from that point on totally pre-determined (else history would change), is there some wiggle room for self-determination if the actions were never documented; or can history be changed and a new universe born?

Of course, the infrastructure that produced the technological goodies needed to do such shows no longer exists, thereby providing employment for Sparrow, our first-person narrator, as he is one of the few that still has the necessary knowledge of electronics to repair this gear when there are the inevitable breakdowns.<br /><br />Sparrow has a problem, however, of having `blank' spots in his memory, times when he can't remember what he did or where he went, only knowing that where he woke up is far from when his last memory says he was. Finding out the answer to these blank spots involves tarot cards, the Horsemen, the dictator of the city, a search for revenge on the person who helped instigate the nuclear war, hoodoo magic, and a cast of very well realized characters. Each of these characters have their own pasts and problems, and they all grow and change considerably during the course of this book's action. Some of the action is very `unpretty', almost gross, but provides a strong line of plot thread that well illuminates one of the main thematic points here, of the importance of friendship and community and that the means to find these things involves baring your soul a bit to others. The odd meld of magic and technology here is refreshing, with some interesting descriptions of the meaning behind the various tarot cards, something I don't normally subscribe to, but Ms. Bull makes them an integral part of the plot, and here it works well.<br /><br />A strong book with a taut plot that is not telegraphed, highlighted by characters that are very different but quite recognizable, a setting and a group of ideas that are not just a rehash of stuff seen hundreds of times elsewhere, all are very good. I had some quibbles with some of the minor characters not being presented with enough force to make them memorable when they reappear after fifty page gaps, and I found some of the descriptive work either over- or under-done, sometimes leaving me floundering about just what the scene was or wishing she would get on with the story.

Many were original with him, such as the multi-generational star-ship. Sometimes he took someone else's idea and added his own fillip to it - which is what he does here.<br /><br />Johann Sebastian Bach Smith is very old, very rich, very stubborn - and caught in the medical straight-jacket of extensive life support. So he conceives of having his brain transplanted - whether the operation is successful or not, he'll at least escape the straight-jacket. So far, an idea done many times before. Now Heinlein adds his own touch, as the 'donor' body turns out to be that of his young, extremely beautiful secretary, Eunice Branca, who was mugged and murdered. When Johann wakes up after the operation, he finds Eunice there in his head, ready to help him adjust to the new world of being very much a female. Is Eunice real, a product of 'body experience'? Or just a figment of Johann's imagination? Heinlein lays clues to this important question throughout the book, but you'll have to read it and make up your own mind.<br /><br />Given the scenario above, this seems to be a perfect setup for Heinlein's traditional storming of the taboo bastions adhering to sex and gender stereotypes in American society. And there is no shortage of comments, situations, and happenings about just these items. Unfortunately, there is entirely too much of this material, occupying almost all of the middle section of this book, and after the first few sexual situations that Joan (the Johann/Eunice hybrid) faces, becomes extremely repetitious. Joan is not very believable as a woman (female characters were never Heinlein's strong point), nor do her actions really jive with what a 95 year old man would do. The internal conversations between Johann and Eunice are interesting and well done, though here again it becomes somewhat repetitious in the later stages of the book.<br /><br />When Heinlein leaves Joan's intimate life for a broader look at his envisioned world, it gets much better. The book is set in what he described in other books as \\"The Crazy Years\\": illiteracy is common, people need to live in armored fortresses, drive in the equivalent of tanks, court decisions are just as crazy as the one's you read about in today's newspaper, homosexuality is actively encouraged as a way to limit population growth, some areas of cities have been completely abandoned by the police as impossible to enforce. Heinlein's description of ordinary living amongst the youth of the times, his depiction of Eunice's husband Joe as a real artist, his satirical snapshots of the headlines of the day are all excellent, and his headlines are far too close to today's reality to be easily dismissed as 'impossible'.<br /><br />Heinlein became extremely ill just as this book was going to final edit, and his wife ended up making some of the decisions about the final form of this book. I think that if Heinlein had been well, a large portion of the middle section of this book would have been cut, and some tightening up done on the rest of it. As it is, it is far from his best, even making allowances. But the idea and situation are intriguing (who hasn't fantasized at least once about what it would be like to be the other sex?), in places Heinlein's power to engross and change your world-view are in full flower, his believable world-building skills much in evidence, his messages important and relevant to today's living.

Mr. Scalzi has obviously spent some time and effort analyzing Heinlein's methods and style, and the result here is an excellent novel that reads just like a brand new Heinlein.<br /><br />The opening paragraph grabs: \\"I did two things on my seventy-fifth birthday. I visited my wife's grave. Then I joined the army.\\" Simple, direct, and immediately intriguing. And from this idea of geriatric soldiers the entire story unfolds: how these advanced age people are given new, enhanced bodies, interfaced with a remarkably effective internal computer, and sent to fight the baddies of the universe. Why they must fight. What the reasons are for living. Where the human race is heading. The problems with making assumptions about other life forms - and the effect that has on diplomacy.<br /><br />Plot wise, this is a series of incidents and battles in the life of a soldier, without any strong goal or endpoint in mind. But as the scenes unfold, the person that is John Perry comes into clearer and clearer focus, a quiet, unassuming man who nevertheless can think on his feet, is not dismayed by radically new things, a natural leader with seventy-five years of experience to back up his decisions and actions, a man capable of deep love. Most of the people around him are not so well realized, but they really don't need to be.<br /><br />Comparison is obviously invited with Heinlein's Starship Troopers with its similar theme and environment. But where Starship Troopers is very much a coming-of-age story, this is an adult trip into the land of survival. And where Starship Troopers had a large amount of philosophy directly exposited, Scalzi's opinions in these areas are much more muted, more shown rather than told. Replacement of Heinlein's powered armor with Scalzi's enhanced bodies doesn't cut down on the action, but does highlight the importance of the mind inside the body, its spirit, its willingness to fight not just for himself but for all of his compatriots and the race as a whole. Where Starship Troopers might be considered a treatise on government, civic responsibility, and military organizations, this has a somewhat less lofty goal, of showing why life is worth fighting for.<br /><br />For anyone who loves Heinlein, this is a must. For those who like military science fiction, this is a must. For those who like a good story, powerfully told, this is a must. I fully expect to see this one on the Hugo nominee shortlist next year. It already has my vote.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)light the importance of the mind inside the body, its spirit, its willingness to fight not just for himself but for all of his compatriots and the race as a whole.

The raiders in this case are 'Wolves' who take one of each pair of twins born in the town (of which there are an inordinate number, nearly all births), but unlike most raiders, they return their booty at a later time - but by then the twin has been brain damaged (or 'roont') and have various physiological changes that turn them into short lived giants. The farmers' solution: hire a group of gunslingers (right out of the movie!). And of course the 'gunslingers' they get are none other than Roland, Eddie, Susannah, and Jake.<br /><br />But why should Roland interrupt his quest for the Dark Tower to help these people? In answering this, King brings into play something that has not been greatly obvious (though certainly present) in the prior books, the standard of ethics ingrained within Roland, part of his original world, of not just chivalry and nobles-oblige, but a groping for an absolute standard of right and wrong.  This thematic line actually runs through just about all of King's books, but within this book I think it comes into clear focus, and must be the underlying lynch-pin of the Tower itself. Also apparent is the new focus King has brought to this work. In the earlier four books, there was a tendency to wander, to bring in items that seemed to have little relevance to over-arching story line. Here, there is a taut plot line, and an explicit explanation for the hows, whys, and makeup of this fantasy universe, a universe that can now be seen as encompassing all worlds, both `real' and fictional. In this, he seems to be following in the footsteps of Robert Heinlein's last few works (and Heinlein is directly referenced a couple of times in this work), in which Heinlein effectively tied all of his works together in a multi-verse of alternate time lines and author-created worlds.<br /><br />Jake and Eddie both come in for some strong character development here, something I felt had been somewhat lacking in books III and IV, and Roland himself exhibits some characteristics that are new but quite fitting. Father Callahan (from Salem's Lot) is introduced as a major player, and his story forms an important sub-plot to this work, though I did feel as if this story was overly drawn out, and could have used a little judicious pruning. Susannah becomes the foreshadow of the next book, as once more she seems to develop multiple personalities, and may be pregnant with the Red King's child.<br /><br />There is pathos, humor, satire, sacrifice, and soul-searching abounding here. Perhaps a little on the wordy side, but as another step towards the Dark Tower, this book achieves its goals well. For anyone who has read the prior books and become hooked by Roland's world, I think this book will satisfy.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)), in which Heinlein effectively tied all of his works together in a multi-verse of alternate time lines and author-created worlds.  <br /> <br />Jake and Eddie both come in for some strong character development here, something I felt had been somewhat lacking in books III and IV, and Roland himself exhibits some characteristics that are new but quite fitting.

This is such a story. First published in abridged format in the February 1959 issue of Amazing Stories under the title of Hunters Out of Time, it is the first portion of a larger story continued in Hunters of Space, published about a year later.<br /><br />Some twenty-five thousand years ago the Brons, fleeing their own exploding sun, arrived on Earth. Finding only belligerent savages on most of the planet, they partnered with the Neeblings, a pre-Norse race of dwarves remembered today in legends as the Little Men, the folk under the Hill, and carved themselves a new home in a huge underground cavern. Lit by an atomic artificial sun, the world they built was a fairyland, always June, quiet, beautiful, and stocked with treasures from the ages. But now their world has a problem, as nuclear tests by the governments of our world have de-stabilized their sun. They send an embassy to our government, but during the discussions their leader, Grim Hagen, becomes enraged and kills the Assistant Secretary he is talking with, but takes a bad knife wound in return. The group finds Dr. Jack Odin, recently returned from the Korean war, and gets him to patch up their wounded member, and eventually take Jack down to their world. Here Jack finds the princess of his dreams, along with discord and hatred nourished by the now recovered Hagen, and the battle is joined.<br /><br />Jack is the proto-typical hero, Maya the fairy-tale princess, Gunnar the dwarf of great strength, all are near stereotypes, with no great depth, but they are all easy to empathize with. The plot is straightforward, with easily seen 'good' and 'bad' sides, but there is some commentary thrown in here and there about politics, war, artwork, prejudice, and just what 'civilized' means that elevates this somewhat above a pure adventure novel. All told with a nice feel for language, at places near poetry, that does much to immerse the reader in this fantasy world.<br /><br />The 'science' here is, to put it charitably, nonsense. But when I first read this at age ten,  that didn't matter. I spent hours drawing pictures of the Bron's spaceship, the treasure house, Gunnar and his broadsword, and the images of this story have remained in my memory for forty-five years, a tribute the sheer power and sense-of-wonder that this story has. In some ways this reads like one of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Barsoom stories, but with better writing, a tauter plot, and a stronger thematic line.<br /><br />As a literary work, this might rate as a two star, certainly not at the level of a Tolkien or Le Guin.

However, this book is definitely not the place to start the series; as a minimum, The Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, and Debt of Honor should definitely be read before this book.<br /><br />Jack, due to the events detailed in Debt of Honor, suddenly finds himself President of the U.S., a position which he never aspired to and in which he feels decidedly uncomfortable. But, good former Marine that he is, he quickly buckles down to the demands of the job - a job that rapidly spawns seemingly endless problems and complications. In detailing these, Clancy weaves an incredible number of sub-plots together: an assassination of the Iraqi President and the amalgamation of that country with Iran, an attempt to kidnap his youngest daughter, a biological attack on the U.S., a heat up of the continuing dispute between the two Chinas, an attempt by the former Vice President to remove Jack from office, and multiple attacks on his integrity by the news media. This is where Clancy shines, as each of these sub-plots is probably strong enough to be a novel in its own right. They all have strong dramatic elements and are not only plausible, but frightening in just how close they are to events in the real world that have occurred since this book was written - so much so that the notion has been put forth that certain terrorist elements got the ideas for their deeds from this book and Debt of Honor.<br /><br />Jack is well drawn. His reactions to situations and problems make sense for the type of man he is, and Clancy does a good job of making the reader empathize with him. Most of the other main characters are shown with enough depth to make them real, though it definitely helps if you have read the prior novels in this series, as some of the background for these characters was presented earlier, and is not re-hashed in this book. However, most of the characters are not excessively deep, and it is very clear who are the `good guys' and who are the `bad', which perhaps is a good thing in a thriller.<br /><br />The battle scenes are typical Clancy, filled with a great number (quite accurate) technical details - perhaps too much so, as at times the picture of just what war is really like gets lost in all these details. Also somewhat of a detraction is the fact that the `good guys' have too easy a time of it; it seems like all their plans are precisely accomplished, with few of the screw-ups and surprises that always happen in real conflicts. Which leads to the other fault with this book - it really is too long, and a fair amount of it could have been cut without losing the impressive tapestry effect.<br /><br />Some may object to the political viewpoints expressed in this novel, as they are decidedly on the right of the spectrum. But Clancy does a good job of detailing why these viewpoints should at least be given some careful thought by all Americans. Here we find good rationales behind limiting the power of the press under certain circumstances; the necessity for maintaining both a strong military and a strong intelligence network; cases where the power of the President may need to exceed the powers granted by the Constitution; when diplomacy is appropriate versus military action (and just how much diplomacy is dependent on having the military power to back up stated positions). It is just these viewpoints that elevate this book from a blockbuster adventure novel to one with substance. A quick perusal of any newspaper today will show exactly the points Clancy makes here, from the obvious `slanting' of the reporting to the need for a military that is second to none.<br /><br />A vivid tale of great breadth, exciting and informational, well worth the time it takes to read.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)and it is very clear who are the `good guys' and who are the `bad', which perhaps is a good thing in a thriller.   <br /> <br />The battle scenes are typical Clancy, filled with a great number (quite accurate) technical details - perhaps too much so, as at times the picture of just what war is really like gets lost in all these details.

But because of this, all too often other aspects of good literature have been ignored or given short shrift by all too many authors. Zelazny does not fall into this trap.<br /><br />The driving idea behind this book is the ability, with the help of some fancy technology, of a trained neuroparticipant therapist to directly monitor and control his patient's dreams.  There is a downside to this: the therapist had better be very emotionally stable himself, else he runs the risk of having the patient take control and impress his thoughts and emotional problems on the therapist. Zelazny takes this basic concept and wraps it first in truly excellent prose; much of this work reads almost like a prose poem. He adds two strong characters, Charles Render, the therapist, and Eileen Shallot, a blind-from-birth woman who wants to be a therapist herself, but must first get over the problem of how to deal with the sights and visions that her future patients will have. Render (and I believe the name is significant, though this is a literary device Zelazny did not normally use) is a tightly controlled person, carefully bulwarking his emotional walls from the pain of the death of his wife and driven to over-protect his brilliant son. Though repeatedly warned of the dangers, he finds the challenge of introducing Eileen to the world of sight irresistible. Thus the stage is set for a trip through the world of dreams, dreams that are perhaps both simpler and more comprehensible than the garden variety most people have, but described with such excellence that it is almost like seeing a sequence of pictures, watercolors and oils in vivid colors.<br /><br />The side characters also have important roles to play, from Eileen's talking seeing-eye dog to Render's nominal current love interest, Jill DeVille. Their actions precipitate the final action of the story, and indicate that the story is both carefully plotted and has a thematic depth that can only be seen when the play of irony surrounding these events and the careful allusions to certain legendary characters is carefully examined.<br /><br />This story was originally published in slightly shorter form as \\"He Who Shapes\\", which took the Nebula award for best novella in 1965. With this expanded form, I think the final irony is more sharply defined, his main characters better fleshed out, but perhaps there are places where some unnecessary verbiage has been added. I would be hard pressed to declare which version is better.<br /><br />The idea is only the kernel.

Eduin Deslucido is such a character, the centerpiece of this trilogy. Saddled with an impossible compulsion by his father to revenge his family by killing all the Hasturs, Eduin, whose basic nature is actually that of a responsible, caring, and loving man, finds himself allied with a wild laran talent in the body of Saravio, both for the surcease from the agony his compulsion causes and as a tool to further his plans for eliminating Carolin Hastur and Varzil Ridenow, whom Eduin sees as the man responsible for keeping Carolin in power.<br /><br />Eduin concocts a couple of schemes to bring Varzil into an undefended position, but when it comes to actually accomplishing his goal, Eduin is shown to be a man of extreme determination and, somewhat as a surprise even to himself, a man of ideals that are diametrically opposed to the mindless revenge desired by his father. His one and only former love, Dyannis, Varzil's sister, in training as a Keeper (at a time when female Keepers were thought impossible - a nice irony to modern Darkover when the exact reverse is thought to be true), becomes an intriguing character in her own right as she struggles to discipline her own talents and, after seeing the consequences of unrestricted laran warfare, a strong supporter of Varzil's Compact to ban the use of such weapons.<br /><br />The characterization of Eduin and Dyannis is excellent and is the major driver of this book. These characters have more depth than is typical for most fantasy, and their inner turmoil is believable and leads directly to much of the action. However, the plot is, compared to other Darkover books, perhaps a little weak and certain elements of the end situation feel like they were pulled out of the hat, not fully melded with the rest of the story. Although this detracts from the overall power of the book, this failing is not major.<br /><br />Thematically, this book continues those themes that have shown up in many of the Darkover stories: the right to self-determination, especially for women; personal integrity; the madness of war; sacrifice of the individual to further a larger goal for all. The final scene of this book does much to make the reader understand just how the Compact came to be accepted and adhered to throughout the centuries between this book's time and modern Darkover, and closes the Clingfire trilogy nicely. The nations of today could do far worse than subscribe to a similar Compact; perhaps if they did everyone could have a sounder sleep.<br /><br />---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)book continues those themes that have shown up in many of the Darkover stories: the right to self-determination, especially for women; personal integrity; the madness of war; sacrifice of the individual to further a larger goal for all.

When it is not a work of biography, but rather an alternate history, and the writer being portrayed is Shakespeare, this act takes courage and more than a bit of chutzpah. Happily, Turtledove is (mostly) equal to this task.<br /><br />Imagining a world where the Spanish Armada won, and England conquered and placed under the nominal rule of Queen Isabella, subsidiary to King Philip II of Spain, in many ways this is an intriguing look at the both the time and place - and its overlap with another SF writer's look at this time, Neal Stephenson's Baroque Cycle, provides an interesting comparison. Instead of Stephenson's incredibly broad look at the times, people, and politics, Turtledove chooses to limit the scope of this book to the theater and its environs, with Shakespeare becoming the focal point of an attempted rebellion, as William Cecil commissions him to write a play designed to inflame the audience. Almost simultaneously, he is commissioned to write a play praising the life and deeds of King Philip, due to be performed upon Philip's death.<br /><br />The tension in this book derives from these two opposing objectives, of how Shakespeare can write and get rehearsals performed of a subversive play while being closely watched by the Spanish for his progress on the King Philip play. Many of the characters presented are familiar ones: Kit Marlowe, Francis Bacon, Richard Burbage; and in general they are well fleshed out, and conform in the main to what is actually known about these people.<br /><br />But more than plot or character, this book is driven by style and place. The dialogue is done in the Elizabethan English of the time, what Shakespeare basically wrote in. At times this is a little unnerving, as the syntax, word order, and vocabulary is such that you need to read a sentence two or three times to make sense of it. But it certainly provides a definitive ambience, which coupled with the descriptions of living, working, hygienic, and religious conditions, the typical fashions in dress and social customs, gives one a very good sense of the era. Turtledove has also inserted some wry jokes: changes in the names of Shakespeare's plays (such a \\"Love's Labour Won\\" instead of \\"Love's Labour Lost\\") and at various appropriate places in the dialogue he has stolen some of Shakespeare's most famous lines, given them perhaps a slightly shifted meaning. You don't need to be a Shakespearian scholar to recognize these, as most of these lines are so famous they have almost become part of the English language, though trying to match the lines to what play they belong in (and if that play had been written by the time of this book) is a more difficult but fun exercise.<br /><br />The major failing I found with this book was that the basic idea behind the plot, that those planning a major rebellion would try to use a play as one of its major lynch-pins, does not come across as very believable. The play could obviously only be performed once, and would an audience of a couple hundred or so really make that much difference to the outcome of an uprising? But as a fun, light read that provides an interesting perspective on the times and the writer, this work does quite well.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)tainly provides a definitive ambience, which coupled with the descriptions of living, working, hygienic, and religious conditions, the typical fashions in dress and social customs, gives one a very good sense of the era.

But as a fun, light read that provides an interesting perspective on the times and the writer, this work does quite well.  <br /> <br /> <br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)	2004-08-23

Ever wished you could go back in time and change one crucial point in history? Ever thought what the world would be like if, say, Lincoln was not assassinated? This book is a compilation of what ifs where what is changed is the life of some famous writer.<br /><br />The introduction, \\"What Killed Science Fiction\\" is an absolute hoot. Detailing the various things that went wrong with real science and the flops that Hollywood made, the fun is finding all the references to things as they are in our world, while it makes a perfect case for just how and why the dreams of science fiction died. And of course, this is a parody of \\"Who Killed Science Fiction\\" of SF fan fame.<br /><br />The first story, \\"The Jackdaw's Last Case\\", is told in typical early 1900 style, with a large amount of description and flowery phrases, as it looks at Franz Kafka as a super-crime fighter. The story is somewhat slight, its interest is in the style and the odd situation, not quite coming off as a parody of the early scientifiction pulp stories.<br /><br />\\"Anne\\" is bittersweet, following a very different life path for Anne Frank. Its conclusion is almost an acidic put down of Hollywood and the American dream.<br /><br />\\"The Happy Valley at the End of the World\\" is, perhaps, the weakest story here, as we enter a world depopulated by a hemorrhagic plague, with a daredevil pilot convinced that H. G. Well's Wings Over the World is the blueprint for how to return the world (and fliers) to glory. Overly long and without much of either the humor or parody that suffuses most of the other stories.<br /><br />\\"Mairzy Doats\\" is my favorite of this bunch, as we find Robert Heinlein, through an odd combination of circumstances (though highly believable - showing just how close to reality some of these alternate histories can be), as President of the United States, and mounting a manned mission to the moon. Heinlein is one of my favorite authors, but I could really appreciate just how well this story extrapolates some of Heinlein's political and social ideas to their extreme, deflating both the ideas and the man in a thoroughly delightful way.<br /><br />\\"Campbell's World\\" is one that any science fiction fan can relate to, showing just what would have happened if Joseph Campbell, rather than John W. Campbell, became editor of Astounding magazine in 1938. The results are literally astounding.<br /><br />\\"Instability\\", written with Rudy Rucker, is one I did not care for, probably because I've never cared for Kerouac, Cassady, Ginsburg and the other `Beats'. But as a story of the ultimate meeting of the Physicist with the Poet, it certainly belongs in this collection.<br /><br />\\"World Wars III\\" is a nice little tale of the world as it would be without Einstein or any of the other physicists who made the A-bomb possible. The added charm of this one is the weird skewing of musical personalities, from the Beatles and Elvis Presley to Barry Sadler and Dionne Warwick.<br /><br />Philip K. Dick married to Linda Ronstadt? \\"Linda and Phil\\" is a quiet tale of alternate realities that Dick (naturally) has to set right. Doesn't quite have the head-splitting wackiness of a Dick original, but good for a quick read.<br /><br />\\"Alice, Alfie, Ted, and the Aliens\\" is one for science fiction aficionados only. The fun is catching who all the people are and which characterizations of them really fit the person. Alfred Bester doesn't come off so well here, but `Chip' Delany is marvelously satirized.<br /><br />Most of these stories have a very strong `in-crowd' element - those who are not steeped in the world of fantastical literature may miss many of the sly, underhanded references scattered throughout. I've been reading this stuff for 45 years, and even so I have the suspicion that I missed a few of them. But there is some good parody, some biting social comment, and a good sense of style throughout these stories. Not perfect, and some of the stories are much weaker than the others, buta good light read, with an occasional laugh.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)weaker than the others, but a good light read, with an occasional laugh.  <br /> <br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)	2004-08-10

But not just any children, rather children who are special, who are prodigies, who in many ways are far stronger than most adults. This book is no exception, with Ansset as the premier Songbird of his day. Songbirds are specially trained child singers, trained in not just the basics of music, but more importantly in how to read the emotional makeup of their audience and express it in their songs.<br /><br />Ansset is assigned to be the Songbird for the Emperor Mikal, a brutal man who thinks nothing of wiping out the entire population of a planet to further his ends. But the end Mikhal is driving toward is lasting peace throughout the galaxy - a truly benevolent dictator. It is just this moral ambiguity that Ansset sees and understands, just as he can understand, accept, and reciprocate the love of Josif, a bisexual who can only be attracted to one person at time.<br /><br />In fact, there are no hard and fast moral laws laid down in this book. Fraud, kidnapping, assassination, murder, homosexuality, pedophilia, devotion, political machinations, and, yes, even true love all receive an examination here, and each item is shown in more than one light. A good part of this book's strength lies within these examinations, which are shown by the events and people Ansset is exposed to, rather than by any sort of expository dialogue. The rest of the strength lies within the raw emotion that sings throughout this book, an almost poetic handling of what would be in lesser hands a very ugly set of happenings. Characterization is excellent, for not just Ansset but also all the players around him: Mikal, Ricktors, Esste, Kya-Kya - each are unique individuals that breathe life into this work.<br /><br />Not so good is the believability of the basic scenarios, from Ansset's incredible ability as a very young child to read the deep emotional makeup of those around him and sing that back to them, certain fighting skills that Ansset learns, even to the musical language members of the Songhouse converse with. While Card makes a good stab at presenting these items in such a way as to try and make them believable, and while reading it these doubts can easily be pushed into the background, after closing the book they leave a bit of a sense of something not quite right, a lack of direct applicability to the 'real' world. While this is not a great flaw, it does bring this book down from the level he achieved in Ender's Game, making it merely very good as opposed to that book's greatness.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)ven to the musical language members of the Songhouse converse with.

Starting as a slave sold to a most unusual beggar, Baslim, we see the first aspect that many equate with the absolute opposite of freedom, though we see that in fact 'slaves' sometimes have more freedom of choice than 'free men'. The society he paints here is vivid and believable (though the economics of slavery in a star-travelling culture has always seemed a little dubious to me). Baslim is far more than he appears to be, and puts Thorby through a rigorous education, both academic and practical. How do you become a really good beggar? Here Heinlein falls in with Ayn Rand - whatever you do, do it to the best of your ability, from begging to juggling. Also there are several comments included here about the integrity of the self - lies to others and misleading yourself both come in for some dictums. These are items that may pass over young readers' heads, but perhaps planting seeds that all assumptions should be examined, nothing should be accepted on 'faith', that personal integrity is more important than 'success', that consequences of actions should be examined carefully before committing to that action.<br /><br />Later, Baslim calls in some favors and sends Thorby to live with the Free Traders, a group of space merchants that keep to themselves with their own unique culture. Here Thorby discovers another aspect of freedom: a person's ability to do as he wishes is severely constrained by the culture in which he lives. The Free Trader society (which owes much to Margaret Mead's seminal ideas, and highlighted by an anthropologist character named Margaret Mader - Heinlein was not usually so obvious with his names) of rigid matriarchal domination and separation into moieties provides security, peace of mind, and the ability through rigid rules of formalism to allow a small group of people to live together for extended periods without breaking any heads, but has as its downside great limitations on freedom of choice. This section of the book may be the best part, as the society is so different from today's American culture that it becomes fascinating in its own right, apart from its effects on Thorby. Thorby himself grows and changes significantly in this part of the book, from first love to determining just how he must balance the demands of duty and personal desires.<br /><br />The last section deals with Thorby back on Earth, within a society not much different from our own, and shows a third aspect of freedom: the internal courageousness to make your own decisions and act upon them. Freedom is just as constrained by internal timidity and/or defining decisions as by external forces. As this last section offers little in terms of new or different views of society (though it is a good mirror of some of the flaws of a capitalistic/lawyer dominated one), it isn't as engrossing as the first two sections, but is highly important in terms of completing Heinlein's thematic investigation of all aspects of freedom.<br /><br />Characterization other than Thorby and Baslim is pretty thin, especially for the females that appear in supporting roles. This was fairly typical for his juveniles, as they were basically strong adventure novels with their primary focus on their central character. But the thematic line on slavery/freedom is much stronger here than most of his messages in other books, and as this particular position is also stated in some of those other works (most especially Farnham's Freehold), has to be seen as one of Heinlein's personal beliefs (unlike some other positions he proposes in his books that seem mainly designed to stir up debate).<br /><br />This book is not Heinlein's absolute best, nor even the best of his so-called 'juveniles' (which are typically better reading than most 'adult' mainstream bestsellers), but still provides an engrossing, fun, and illuminating read.

What makes life worth living? Sound like an outline for a course in philosophy? But these questions are what drives this lyrical, quiet, and unassuming story of two ghosts, a raven, a man caught somewhere in-between the living and the dead, and a very traditional Jewish widow.<br /><br />The raven has an attitude, but insists on dragging sandwiches to Mr. Rebeck, a pharmacist who decided to live in the cemetery many years ago. Mr. Rebeck is lonely most of the time, except when there is a new burial, for then that person's ghost will stick around a little while and keep him company, until the ghost forgets what it is to be human, to be alive.<br /><br />Michael Morgan and Laura are two such new ghosts. Each has a conflicted past, not fully remembered, and take different approaches to this new state of 'living', Michael trying fiercely to retain all he can of himself and his past, Laura trying to fully leave the world of the living. Mr. Rebeck suddenly finds himself with an unusually rich set of company, for besides Michael and Laura, he finds himself involved with the widow Mrs. Klapper, coming to visit the tomb of her husband.<br /><br />Each of these characters is finely delineated, their conversations with each other slowly illuminating their pasts, their ambitions, their fears, and their hopes. From a little evening singing, quiet walks, the raven bringing news of the outside world, the story is built bit by little bit, with no large dramatic moments until the very end. It is, in essence, a character study, and each character's approach to life imposes its message about life's meaning and purpose. There are some fairly deep philosophical ruminations presented within this, part and parcel of the story line, stated with ease and a poetic feel that suffuses this entire work, with the raven perhaps as the cynic to provide some balance and comedy relief. Ah, but the final point is the attraction these characters begin to feel for each other, all quite logical, even predictable, but the result we end with is a believable love story of both the dead and the living.<br /><br />Perhaps this work could have done with a little more action, a little more drama. But then again, adding such elements might have spoiled this poem in prose. Not perfect, but certainly one of the more unusual and very readable fantasy works I've read, with a set of ideas that possibly could not have been investigated in any other literary genre.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)e characters begin to feel for each other, all quite logical, even predictable, but the result we end with is a believable love story of both the dead and the living.  <br /> <br />Perhaps this work could have done with a little more action, a little more drama.

For some reason, the current theories about just how our universe came to be and what its ultimate fate will be seems to have captivated many hard SF practitioners in the last few years. This book is certainly a member of that group (to the extreme!), but it also throws in backward quantum waves, quantum nuggets, Bayesian statistics, and an impending catastrophe that will literally wipe out humanity.<br />So there is certainly enough of the `hard stuff' to satisfy any science enthusiast. But what of the story? This, perhaps, is just as wild as the science, imagining a single individual, Reid Malenfant, trying to propel the world into true space travel, real exploitation of the resources available there, who is just rich enough, and brilliant enough, to possibly bring it off, in the face of the by now de rigor opposition by environmentalists, NASA, EPA, FBI, Congress, and all the rest of the alphabet soup. But Reid becomes sidetracked when he is led to see what he believes is a message from the far future, causing a change of target to a small asteroid with an unusual orbit locked to Earth's. The initial probe is manned by an enhanced squid, whose development and behaviors from a significant sub-plot. But discovered on the asteroid is an obvious `artifact', (clearly a crib from Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey), a glowing blue ring that apparently leads to other times and universes.<br />In the meantime, on Earth there has been a sudden appearance of `Blue Children', fantastically intelligent, semi-autistic, who quickly gain the abhorrence of almost all `normal' people as different, a threat to humanity as homo sapiens. Gathered together, these children apparently invent a machine to capture a quantum nugget, with perhaps dire consequences for the world.<br />How these separate threads get folded together into a truly gorgeous trip through the history and future of not just our universe, but many others, (a near biological spawning of universe from universe, each growing towards conditions that might spawn intelligent life), becomes complicated, and the vision itself has to carry the story, reminiscent of Olaf Stapledon in his wilder moments. Baxter almost brings this off, as the vision truly is grand, but in presenting this he seems to lose sight of the story of his characters, and the ultimate message of the book is either extremely depressing or seemingly irrelevant to people of today.<br />The science is real, the complications of the story worthy of something by A. E. van Vogt, but plot and science alone cannot carry the full weight of this story. His characters are introduced well, and I could easily believe in someone like Reid or his former wife and even Cornelius, but their growth (or lack of it) through the later parts of the story did not quite ring true.

Benford has been one of the major practitioners of this field for some time, and this book could possibly be the ultimate expression of it, it terms of pure science. The other requirement, to tell a good fictional story, however, is just not on a par with the science.<br />The scientific point of extrapolation here is a small, silvery sphere that is produced as the result of a sub-atomic particle physics experiment. This result is totally unexpected, and wrecks a good portion of the equipment when it appears, forcing the lead experimenter, Alicia, a black female physicist, to stop any further planned work. On impulse (or gut feeling), she takes the sphere back to her own university, without informing anyone else what she is doing. Upon investigation, and with the help of a theoretical physicist, slowly a theory is developed about what the sphere is - a `pocket' universe budded off from our own, which is evolving at a time rate that is exponentially faster than our own.<br />The description of the evolution of this sub-universe is based on some of the more current theories of the day, starting from the moment of the Big Bang to points that are far in the future history of our own universe, and are well described and easy to follow. However, I found the university politics that surround Alicia's theft of the sphere somewhat unbelievable, as her institution leaves her, an untenured junior professor, in sole charge of the investigation even after preliminary results indicate that it may be one of the scientific breakthroughs of the century, and one of the side effects of the sphere is the direct cause of the death of one of her students. The bureaucratic quagmire that makes up the university administration is more believable, with individuals who are more interested in having Alicia, as a minority representative, help on committees devoted to such subjects rather than work on science, and others who are clearly out to only hold on to their own positions in the school. The small scene of the President's involvement of using the sphere as one more campaign aid, without any understanding of the real science or its import, is, unfortunately, spot on.<br />Characterization for the secondary characters (Alicia's helpers and her theoretical physicist) is quite reasonable, but I found myself looking serious askance at Alicia herself. I found it difficult to believe that someone steeped in the methods and doctrine of science would steal and conceal such a find; her reactions to others trying to place her in the `minority' box came off as much too mild; and those scenes where she is on the prowl for a man felt like they belonged to a different person.<br />The end of the book takes a route that I felt was even more unbelievable than the initial `theft' of the sphere, and did little to really resolve either Benford's character conflicts or the philosophical musings on the fate of the universe and the reason `our' universe is so perfectly `tuned' to allow the production of life.

This book is somewhat of a departure for him, being more science fiction oriented than fantasy.<br />The main building block of this book is a rather unique restaurant that moves itself through space and time whenever a nuclear weapon is exploded in its near vicinity.  Inside the restaurant is an Irish folk-song band that accidentally was caught up during the restaurant's first move. As the plot develops and the restaurant makes several moves through time and to other planets, the band begins to realize that they are part of an attempt to change future history by opposing a group that keeps going around starting nuclear wars. Not a bad concept, but it does lead to somewhat episodic patches, rather than being a linear whole.<br />Much of the characterization comes through as individual flash-backs to defining events in their lives; present time dialogue and interaction with others is somewhat flimsy, but overall there is certainly enough `reality' to these characters to carry the story. Of course, as a band, their music intrudes in several places, which certainly provides some atmosphere, but I found Brust's description of some of this quite a bit over my head, not being a musician myself. I've run into this same problem with Emma Bull (who was a member of the same band as Brust) and Spider Robinson - it is simply very difficult to describe in written language what is almost totally an aural experience, but I'll give him good marks for a decent stab at trying.<br />While the final resolution of the story made sense and was satisfying, I found that the basic motivation/rationale behind the war starting group just did not seem adequate justification for their actions.

So it was with some trepidation that I picked up this sequel, written with a co-author and many years after the original two, as my experience with this type of thing has not been good. I was pleasantly surprised.<br />The story picks up almost immediately after the events of Lord of Thunder, with Hosteen, Brad, Logan, and Dumaroy still much in evidence. A new major character, Tani, is introduced, child of another Beast Master, but mainly raised by her gene-scientist aunt and uncle. Her father was killed during the Xik war, and her mother, believing his death was a product of high command malfeasance and most beast master's attitude of treating their teams merely as tools, inculcated in Tani a belief that beast masters were not good people and that animals should never be used for war purposes.<br />The Ark, a gene bank of just about every Terran species, was put together during the war as a fail safe to ensure that life forms were not permanently lost. Tani and her aunt and uncle bring the Ark to Azor, both to collect new gene specimens and to possibly create mates for Hosteen's animal team. But on Azor, a strange set of killings, both of animal life and Norbie/humans, has started to occur, seemingly originating out of the Deep Blue, causing some Nitra tribes to move into the area around Hosteen's ranch. This sets the stage for Tani to become deeply involved in the Norbie tribal culture, and for her to find and use her own beast master talents to combat the threat.<br />Tani is a well realized character, with enough background to allow understanding of her feelings and positions, who changes during the course of the action in a believable manner. Hosteen also shows some development, to a mature man who knows at least some of what he wants out of life. The plot is comparatively simple, but there are certainly enough thrill points and dramatic moments to hold your attention, and it is not just another re-hash of plot lines Norton has used many times in the past.<br />Thematically this work does not tread much new or deep ground. Those familiar with Norton's work will certainly recognize her themes of the sacredness of life balanced by practical necessity, of the need for honesty and the room to be distinct individuals, of the value of cultural heritage, of respecting the beliefs of others, and the sometime power of belief in the unseen.  This is not necessarily bad, as profoundness of philosophical thought in this work would have worked against its basic nature of being an adventure tale, and the level provided still gives enough food for thought to be useful.<br />The ending was perhaps a little too pat, with certain relationships easily predictable, and the primary mystery's resolution too easy given the earlier books in this series background. Also, I found myself missing any real involvement of the ancient vanished alien race that created the Sealed Caves that was so prominent in the first two books.<br />Not as strong as the first two books in the set, but a very nice addition, and has helped restore my faith in sequels written with co-authors.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)amatic moments to hold your attention, and it is not just another re-hash of plot lines Norton has used many times in the past. <br />Thematically this work does not tread much new or deep ground.

And just about every chess player finds themselves fascinated by the enigma that is Bobby Fischer. Possibly the strongest player ever (though many will put forth other players as possibly stronger), who almost single-handedly changed the rules (and the prize money) for tournament players everywhere, he is also the only man to ever forfeit the World Championship, the only one to earn almost universal disgust for his anti-Semite and anti-American diatribes.<br />This book details the events and characters that led up to the 1972 World Championship match in Reykjavik, Iceland. You don't have to be a chess player to read this (almost none of the actual game details are covered here - there are many other books that perform this task). The focus is on how a lone American challenged for and finally won the world title, a title that had been held by the Soviets since the end of World War II. The Cold War between these two countries forms the backdrop for this encounter, and incredible as it may sound, diplomats, lawyers, the KGB, high political figures in both countries, and multi-millionaires helped create and shape many of the events leading to the match - for a game that had, at the time, perhaps 10,000 serious adherents in the U.S.<br />The authors delve deeply into the characters of both Bobby and Boris Spassky, giving a large amount of biographical detail, some of which is either not widely known or newly revealed here, using as sources both FBI files and documents from the KGB and other Soviet agencies. Their assessments of the mental state of both participants will generally ring true, amply supported by documents, interview material, photos and assessments by other grandmasters, though at times I thought they may have gone a bit overboard with generalizations. Also well presented is the political and chess climate that swirled around the match itself and the InterZonal and Candidates Matches leading to it.

Is such behavior inherent in the biological makeup of humans? Can it be modified via chemical means or by changing some small portion of the human DNA structure? Or, perhaps, is this a cultural, learned trait that can be eradicated with proper education and training? What influence does organized religion have on the relationship between the sexes? These questions form the primary focus of this novel, a novel that perhaps can be considered a feminist tract, but may also be considered as a good story about an age-old problem.<br /><br /> From a starting point of the mundane world of 1959, when seven women of very different personalities enter college and form a tight bond with each other, this book travels in quiet, incremental stages to a world that is frightening and strange but in all too many ways much too believable. For by the year 2000 (this book was written in 1996), bands of men roam the streets with whips, looking for any woman who is sinful enough to dress in skirts that expose their legs, and such attacks on women are carefully ignored by police, where the Pope allies with Islamic fundamentalists in calling for women's place in the world to be limited and totally subservient to men, and women's colleges are being bombed. For those who say \\"this could never happen\\", it should be kept in mind that societies' ideas about what is proper and moral can change, and change drastically, and not just towards a more liberal set of ideas. The return to Islamic fundamentalism in Iran happened quickly, and with the support of good portion of its populace. Still, it is a bit of stretch to imagine such a change in just the four years that Tepper's scenario envisions.<br /><br /> But she has a reason for having such changes happen so quickly - behind her story of normal men and women there is another force, the Alliance, headed by one of the richest men in the world. A man who seems bent on enslaving all the women of the world, with the resources to bend and influence a large number of men, who is planning on an apocalypse with only his chosen favored few as survivors. How the college band of women, now in late middle age, with careers, children, and for some, husbands, work towards unraveling the mystery of why the world is changing so fast forms the heart of the plot. From FBI files to biology laboratories, with murders and judge-buying, Tepper adds believable elements to her story, making the first three-quarters of this book a good read, even if you don't believe that all men are evil or that women have always been downtrodden. Her women characters are well drawn, most especially those of Carolyn Crespin, the main protagonist, Faye as a lesbian sculptor, and Agnes as a nun with doubts. Her male characters, those that we see, are not so good - either impossibly cold and power obsessed, or too acquiescent and thinly drawn.<br /><br /> But the tail end of this book was a let down, as Tepper spins off into not just the realm of plausible science fiction, but into religious fantasy. And in doing so, I think her message about how the sexes should relate to each other gets diluted, as blame for poor treatment of women can be shifted to hormonal drives and/or the influence of a supernatural being. I think this book would have been better if it had stayed within the world of today, and looked a little deeper into the social dynamics driving gender relationships, without call to external forces or scientific breakthroughs to either explain or change such behavior.<br /><br /> Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)women of the world, with the resources to bend and influence a large number of men, who is planning on an apocalypse with only his chosen favored few as survivors.

For this book, he decided to pay homage to some of the great mystery/detective writers of yesterday, deliberately trying to emulate their styles, mannerisms, and at least for his protagonist, their characters. In doing so, he seemed to lose sight of the idea of telling a cohesive integrated story, as this book very much separates itself in to two separate plot lines that are really only marginally related to each other.<br />His protagonist is, naturally, a private eye, one who tries hard to imitate the role models defined by Chandler, MacDonald, Spillaine, and others. He is called on to investigate some strange goings on in the most incredible bordello ever devised, Lady Sally's Place, located just across the bridge from the UN. It's a place where the `artists' have `clients', where talking dogs and telepathic twins are considered normal, a place where everyone can satisfy their desires without guilt or fears. Our P.I. quickly accepts the impossibilities of this place, and by making consistent intuitive leaps (which will sometimes leave you gaping at the holes he jumps over), fairly quickly solves the original mystery, falls in love, and is accepted as being good enough to join the crowd at Lady Sally's. Most of this section is quite good, with puns flying, clues properly presented, and the scene well painted, although it will definitely help if you have read several other books in the Callahan series, as many of the characters introduced here are very much cameos, with their background buried in the those other stories. The concept of Lady Sally's place is one that should make you think, and might help give you completely different viewpoint on the `world's oldest profession' - but this item was covered better, with more grittiness and real-world activity, in Callahan's Lady.<br />But after solving the one mystery, the story takes off in a totally different direction, where the crowd of Lady Sally's is now engaged in a strong bit of world saving. The premise is good - nuclear weapons smuggled into the US and other countries by pacifists as the ultimate hammer to convince the world to abrogate war. Unfortunately, the solutions to finding these weapons and the plotters behind them is very far-fetched, from having Nichola Tesla (one of the early pioneers of electricity) whip up a super-duper circuit to pinpoint the weapon's location to the immediate acceptance by all concerned that this was really happening without any objective basis in known fact. This section is also much more serious than the first half, and the hard-boiled P.I. character that Robinson has so carefully constructed in the first half seems to get lost.<br />This book should probably have been published as two separate novelettes, given the disparity of plot line between the two halves. As it is, it makes for an enjoyable read, but is certainly not Spider's best, and not even one of the better Callahan series tales.<br />Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)an's Lady.<br />But after solving the one mystery, the story takes off in a totally different direction, where the crowd of Lady Sally's is now engaged in a strong bit of world saving.

As her second entry into the world of fantasy, she shows in this book the same talent, dedication to detail, and adherence to the strictures of good writing applicable to the chosen genre as she does in her science fiction works.<br />Typical of many fantasy works, the imagined world is one of a feudal society, with technology appropriate to the Middle Ages, and deals almost entirely with the trials and tribulations of its aristocracy. But odd sidelights are shown on the working class folks, as we learn the details Lupe dy Cazaril experiences. A minor lord who was betrayed into slavery, we open the book with Caz, now a physically broken man, penniless, walks back to the only place he can think of that might offer him at least some sort of job, the castle at Valenda. Fate here is a little kinder, as he is given the job of tutor to royesse Iselle, sister to the heir of Chalion, and her lady in waiting Betriz, a job well suited to his current physical condition, requiring only quick wits and getting his charges to respect him. But this post leads Caz into the deep waters of court intrigue when the two girls and the fourteen-year old heir are called to the royal court of Cardegoss.<br />For the first 150 pages, there is very little magic, nothing to separate this world from the mundane, except one instance of `death magic', an item that is attempted only rarely, as, when successful, it invariably kills the practitioner as well as the desired target. But when Iselle is promised to Dondo, brother of the Lord Chancellor, whom she decidedly despises, Caz attempts this magic himself, as the only way he sees to protect her. The fallout from this forms the main basis of the plot, complete with mystery, action, and an unraveling of a curse that exposes the much nearer relationship of the gods of this world to its inhabitants than is seen in our world. The invented religion shown here is one of the main points of departure from our own, and is inventive, believable, and inextricably tied to the plot action.<br />Caz is a true man of honor, as we are shown in incident after incident. This is one of the appeals of most fantasy works, as heroes are common coin, not relegated to the trashbin of other literary forms, and makes for interesting, uplifting reading. Iselle and Betriz are originally shown as typical teenage girls, flighty and irresponsible, but they show a sudden change to much more mature individuals after Iselle's bethrothal, a change I found a little difficult to believe due to its rapidity. But as adult characters they show steel, inventiveness, recognition of those true to them, characteristics of proper heroines. The minor characters are interesting and in many cases given a fair amount of development, leading to a very satisfactory intertwining of motivations, treachery, and incident. The romance that develops between Caz and Betritz is predictable, but well handled.<br />Most of the humor that suffuses her Miles books is missing here, and perhaps this book would have been a little better if more of it had been present. But as it is this is a satisfying read, with characters you can empathize with, and just enough touch of different, of things not as they are in our world, to whet your appetite for more words about this world.<br />Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)ts than is seen in our world.

Very effective, with a well realized main character, it explores what the real purpose of life is under the pressure of either trying to change or preserve the past.<br /><br />The best story here may be \\"All My Darling Daughters\\", which presents a boarding school of the future that will surprise and shock. Written in a futuristic teen slang that takes a little time to get used to (and is quite a departure from Willis' normal style), its investigation of sexual morals and abusive `fathers' provides much food for thought. The story is strongly anti-male without crossing the line into being a feminist tract, with a fair dollop of Willis' trademark satire. Disturbing and all too believable.<br /><br />\\"Sidon in the Mirror\\" is an odd combination of science fiction and horror. From a starting point of call-girl house located on the surface of a star, it travels an unusual road through murder, love, and true desires for death as it follows a being who, by nature, ends up becoming a `copy' of someone in his close circle of acquaintances. Very different, but I did feel the ending was a little too pat.<br /><br />\\"Samaritan\\" explores an area investigated by several others, such as Heinlein's \\"Jerry Was Man\\" and Orson Scott Card's Lovelock, about where the line should be drawn between animal and human. As usual, Connie brings her own viewpoint to this idea, and does so in quite an effective manner.<br /><br />\\"Service for the Burial of the Dead\\" definitely crosses the line into fantasy/horror, but regardless of the genre, Willis knows how to write a tale that will engross and force the reader's participation - in this case, in a most spine-tingling manner.<br /><br />\\"Mail Order Clone\\" deals with a man who orders a clone of himself from a magazine ad, and has a definite funny side as it explores gullibility, bureaucracies, and domestic relations.<br /><br />\\"Daisy in the Sun\\" will take a bit of effort to follow, as for much of the early part of the story things do not seem to be very logical - in fact much of it feels very dreamlike, with a dream's lack of consistency. \\"A Letter from the Clearys\\", while well written, follows too closely to some by now clich&eacute;d ideas. \\"And Come from Miles Around\\" is too slight an idea to be really effective, but makes for a decent quiet read.<br /><br />\\"Blued Moon\\" is, for my money, the weakest story in the book, dealing with happenstances of coincidence gone wild, under the influence of an artificial blue moon. Here I'm afraid Willis tried too hard for the slapstick and the crazy within her satirical outline, but this was the only story in the book that I thought really failed.<br /><br />Overall, Willis demonstrates, in story after story, a great understanding of human nature, from its best attributes to its embarrassing foibles. She can be funny, poignant, ethereal, biting, demanding, and gritty, but she is always entertaining and worth reading.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)tion - in this case, in a most spine-tingling manner.    \\"Mail Order Clone\\" deals with a man who orders a clone of himself from a magazine ad, and has a definite funny side as it explores gullibility, bureaucracies, and domestic relations.     \\"Daisy in the Sun\\" will take a bit of effort to follow, as for much of the early part of the story things do not seem to be very logical - in fact much of it feels very dreamlike, with a dream's lack of consistency. \\"A Letter from the Clearys\\", while well written, follows too closely to some by now clichd ideas. \\"And Come from Miles Around\\" is too slight an idea to be really effective, but makes for a decent quiet read.      \\"Blued Moon\\" is, for my money, the weakest story in the book, dealing with happenstances of coincidence gone wild, under the influence of an artificial blue moon.

Unfortunately, this work has none of this trademark.<br />The initial premise of the story is interesting: during the fourth century, when in our world the barbarian hordes were massing on Rome's borders, in this world the area north of Rome was infested by the Evil, basically all the creatures of fantasy legend, harpies, dragons, even unicorns (who are not so nice in this book). The Evil effectively formed a buffer between Rome and the barbarians, allowing Rome to continue to exist to the present day. As a consequence, the world apparently never had a Renaissance, and is still stuck in a feudal social organization.<br />With this as background, the story details the adventures of a small band of beings, Harcourt, the Knurly Man (who is not quite human), an abbot, and an orphan girl with a talent for wood carving, as they attempt to retrieve a prism said to have the soul of a great saint captured inside and find Harcourt's lady love, Eloise. This has possibilities, but I found many problems with the actual execution of this work.<br />First is the characterization. The abbot never comes across as more than a set piece to allow Simak to detail some religious viewpoints, rather bluntly satirizing the sometimes rather harsh dictums of the Catholic church. His constant whining and bickering with the Knurly Man (who apparently is more than a thousand years old, and does not follow any religious dictate) quickly becomes irritating. Harcourt is better developed, but his obsession with Eloise, whom he thinks is probably dead and hasn't seen in seven years, is not made very believable. The most interesting character is the orphan girl, who has a very mysterious past and pops up with odd abilities at crucial junctures, but we never get to really see her as a person.<br />Second is the various encounters the band has with the Evil. As I read through this, I kept feeling that each incident was a stop meant to display another of the various denizens of the Evil - unicorn, harpy, ogre, troll - but there didn't seem to be any unified cohesion to the incidents. The best section, and the only one that really seemed in evoke a sense of magic, was a dreamlike call to and struggle with the `Elder Ones', clearly a small homage to Lovecraft. Overall, the Evil pretty much remains faceless, without a true element of magical danger that it should have evoked.<br />Third was the resolution to the mystery of why the Evil was so carefully guarding the prism.

Certainly not his best story, as it is too short and the characters are not fully fleshed out, but it started a revolution.<br /><br />\\"Let There be Light\\" deals with two scientists who figure out a way to transform sunlight into electricity at near 100% efficiency and extremely cheaply, but who find they can't sell it due to pressure from the existing power generation companies. The two main characters are near stereotypes, and the attitude of the male towards his female counterpart may strike many as extremely chauvinistic, an attitude that was quite prevalent in Heinlein's writing from this period. But it should be kept in mind that this was the general American attitude towards women at this point in our history. Of more interest is the apparent `conspiracy' of the power companies to bury this invention. Heinlein's explanation for their actions brings this into focus as a natural reaction of companies attempting to protect their source of income - and in doing so exposes one of the real problems with unfettered capitalism.<br /><br />\\"The Roads Must Roll\\" gives you get a good sense of just why Heinlein came to dominate the science fiction field so rapidly, as the story rings with real world ambience, even though the envisioned technology is one case where Heinlein got it seriously wrong, seeing giant conveyor belts, or rolling roads, as replacing the car and railroads, thus leading to a strong dependence of the economy on them. Those who keep those roads rolling are in an obvious position of power and the story is all about one such case of the `little guy' attempting to force things to go his way. The story is well told, the characters on both sides of this battle are quite believable, the social organization makes sense. Thematically, the story addresses the sense that many who work in essential industries have that THEY should be the ones who make all the decisions, who cannot see that our civilization is made of many specialties, all of whom are necessary to the continued functioning of the society as a whole. Within the confines of this story there is an encapsulation of many of the larger battles caused by this attitude, from the great owner/union fights of the early portion of twentieth century, to the more generalized battle between the ideas of socialism and capitalism.<br /><br />\\"Blowups Happen\\" deals with the stresses that men come under when trying to monitor and control an atomic power plant, with the knowledge that one small error could make the whole thing blow up and wipe out at least three states, if not the whole planet. Written in 1940, before the exact details of controlled nuclear fission were known, it may seem a little dated today. But as the story is truly about how people react under this kind of extreme pressure, and what, if anything, can be done to help people cope with it, it is still a very relevant story.<br /><br />\\"The Man Who Sold the Moon\\" is the longest piece here. D. D. Harriman is a man who not only has a dream of traveling to the moon, he has (almost) the financial means to do it. Harriman's schemes to not only raise the necessary money but to ensure that he will retain control of the moon once he gets there are convoluted, devious, devastatingly logical - and almost the complete antithesis of the way NASA has actually gone about it. You might think that this story is hopelessly outdated - after all, we've actually been to the moon! But the story has much to say about the world of today. Government financing of space travel will only go so far. Private financing and people figuring out how to make a profit out of this frontier will be the ultimate driver - and a very large amount of the points this story makes are very applicable to such an approach. But perhaps more important than the actual method Harriman uses to achieve his dream is the very fact that he has such a dream. Heinlein invariably presented the point that without dreamers there would be no progress, no hope for an eventual better world. Perhaps this is a flaw in his writing, but I, for one, would much rather read about heroes, the dreamers, those who are attempting to change things for the better, than yet another story detailing the tribulations of a semi-neurotic Joe everyman.<br /><br />\\"Requiem\\" continues the story of D. D. Harriman, now very old and in frail health, still trying to get to moon, having been prevented by his financial partners from going as too valuable to risk. This story pulls out all the emotional stops, though it is quite understated in terms of direct exposition. I have read it multiple times, and it still causes me to choke up a bit when I reach the end. It's the best story here.<br /><br />There are places where the age of these stories is all too evident, a congenital hazard to writing science fiction, and in places Heinlein's writing technique is not as polished as it could have been, being written very early in his career.

I suppose this is because it is written in that old, dry English style of describing the perfectly ordinary in very quiet tones, with much description and little action, till suddenly you find that what is being presented is not ordinary at all, but rather the stuff of all too realistic nightmares. In fact, it strongly reminded me of some of H.G. Wells work in style and tone.<br />Supposing a future world where the Nazi's really did establish themselves as the rulers of the world (and the War is long past), the story deals with an Englishman who `falls' into this world by inexplicable means. Dealt with initially as an honored guest, he does not really begin to see the problems in his host's society till it is almost too late. The horrors of this society are kept almost totally in the background, hidden behind a façade of gentility, and not reaching the foreground and directly stated till near the very end. This type of presentation can be effective, but in this case it kept me at a distance from the horrors, not able to really feel them, leaving me asking \\"would the Nazi regime really be no worse than this?\\" For me, anyway, the horror was too little, and the work was too short, as in construction it's really an extended short story, not a novel. Also, perhaps, the envisaged final structure of the Nazi regime, after having finished dealing with their `problem' of Jews and other `impure' races, is too much based on the country manor lord, who wants only peace, discipline, and a chance for a good hunt (even if that hunt is well beyond the pale of normally acceptable human behavior), while the demands and problems of cities, factories, and schools are not touched on.<br />Still, especially for those who like this kind of dry, understated style, it is reasonable reading experience, and provides one more portrait of just how depraved some humans can be when allowed total free reign to their every impulse.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)eviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)	2004-03-08

Part mystery, part romance, part art history, part social ill investigation, part New England travelogue - and none of those categories really says what this book is.<br />Michelle Trutor is engaged by her friend Arthur Wharton (the `balloonist') to help decipher the life of his adoptive sister Caroline, at least partly as a gesture to give Michelle a safe place to stay away from her abusive boyfriend. But what starts as a task that she can bury herself in to hide from her problems quickly becomes near-totally absorbing, as she finds all the members of the Wharton family to be at least mildly eccentric, and whose life-style has been sharply warped be the terms of Caroline's will. Caroline herself is slowly revealed via journal entries, interviews with former acquaintances, and most especially by the artworks and Victorian-styled riddles she has left behind.<br />This is where this book shines, as each character is beautifully limned by Wesselman's pen, and all the characters become interesting as persons you would like to know. Caroline's journal entries have a completely different feel and style from Trutor's ruminations, but both are highly appropriate for their characters; Arthur and his twin brother Proctor are diametric opposites who nevertheless display a bone-deep similarity; Sissy, the town librarian saved from her own troubles with an abusive husband by Trutor, develops from a non-descript mouse to an independent lady. All are believable people, even if they are not just like your next-door neighbor - and that is a good part of the charm and value of this book.<br />The action develops logically, with proper `clues' laid before the revelations about Caroline and her life. Those clues in the form of riddles will also stretch your mind if you try to solve them by yourself, as the answers are far from obvious, but very important to the final resolution of book. The powerful theme of just what damage abusive people can wreak and how to deal with such people is developed as both an overt theme in the persons of Trutor's boyfriend and Sissy's husband, and a more buried thread in the visage of Caroline's effects on those around her both during her life and after her death.<br />The book can be read quickly (though trying to solve those riddles may slow you down a lot!) and never seems to develop any dry patches. The descriptions of the New England area are almost lyrical and very accurate (I've been to most of the places described in this book). Perhaps the only thing stopping this from being a great book is that it is too short to develop the full depth of all the characters (I would have loved to learn more about what makes Proctor tick). As it is, and regardless of what category of fiction you might think this falls into, this is very entertaining book, with lovely people, a mind-stretcher, and with something significant to say about a problem that is all too endemic within our society.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)e can wreak and how to deal with such people is developed as both an overt theme in the persons of Trutor's boyfriend and Sissy's husband, and a more buried thread in the visage of Caroline's effects on those around her both during her life and after her death. <br />The book can be read quickly (though trying to solve those riddles may slow you down a lot!) and never seems to develop any dry patches.

Rex to paleontologists who devote their lives to determining the real facts about these former rulers of the Earth. And it is just such a determined researcher who is offered a life-time dream: the ability to go back in time and actually see the objects of his study in action. But there are a few strings attached to the offer: time travel is a secret, and he can't divulge any of his findings to the world at large, nor can he, by either action or word, be the cause of a time-wrecking paradox.<br />A good premise for a novel, and Swanwick does a good job of developing both the situation and his major characters. Thematically, Swanwick looks at the reasons people work beyond that of merely surviving, and the lengths some people will go to, including murder, due to their obsessions with some form of `belief' system (in this case, the major players are the Creationists and federal bureaucrats). It is the conflict between belief systems that leads to the major story action, leaving a party of scientists stranded in the far past and forced to learn how to survive in this environment without most of today's technological marvels, while another group works to rescue the party by working into the very far future - which has its own surprises.<br />But there are a few problems here. For anyone other than a paleontologist who is highly familiar with the various classes and species of dinosaurs, a lot of the description of these animals will seem to be couched in almost impenetrable scientific terms (quick, off the top of your head, what's a `hadrosaur'?). Then too, the long period when the existence of time travel was supposedly kept secret, even though there are literally hundreds of people who are engaging in it, stretched my `suspension of disbelief' quotient. The use of cell phones in the distant past also bothered me - how is such a network initiated and controlled without all the infrastructure of wireless systems? Close attention must be paid to the various time-line trip directions and actions, else the conclusion of the book will make little sense - and time-altering paradoxes are known for creating mind- warping headaches.<br />In the end, though, the above problems are comparatively minor when compared to the strength of his characters and the multiple ideas, such as a new theory about both the social organization of dinosaurs and the reasons for their extinction, that Swanwick presents. A thinking man's book, written in a field replete with mass-market blockbusters most of which don't even know what science is. It's nice to able to read something that doesn't insult your intelligence and still tells an engaging story. It's easy to see why this book was nominated for the 2003 Hugo Award, and in fact I think this book is better than the book that won, Robert J. Sawyer's Hominids (though not as good as another nominee, China Mieville's The Scar).<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)ntrolled without all the infrastructure of wireless systems?

Fritz once again proves that he could handle almost any medium, any subject with this wild tale of a time war between these two S&S organizations (and the SS is deliberate). A war that stretches from 100 million years in our past to at least as far in the future - but all the action of this tale takes place in a very confined space known simply as The Place, isolated from the Change Winds that continually blow in from the Void. A Place where time-warriors go for some rest and recuperation from the stresses of fighting and a continually changing past and future, staffed by some rather odd individuals.  There's Sid, nominally in charge, a 16th century Englishman, and Greta, who died both in 1929 and in 1955 in Hitler's Greater Chicago. Then there's Maud, everybody's idea of a grandmother, Doc, who normally staggers about in extreme inebriation, and Lilli, nurse and good-time girl from WWI.<br />Now throw in Erich, recruited from Hitler's army, Bruce, an early 20th century Englishman, a octopoid Lunarian from 100 million years ago, a satyr from far in the future, thrown into the Place at the end of their mission, and a couple of Ghost Girls just to liven up the party. Add one A-bomb, courtesy of rescuing a failed attack mission, and a gadget that cuts off the Place from everything - not just normal time, but even Change time and the physical universe.<br />This is the stage setting - and it does read very much like a play (Fritz was no stranger to the theater). And from these materials Leiber constructs a fascinating set characters sharply illuminated by stress, both from the Change War and internally, as the A-bomb is triggered to go off in half an hour. Each of the characters manages to present a different perspective on life, love, war and peace, and the purpose of intelligent entities, a discourse that gets wrapped up in something of a locked room mystery story, and is enfolded by very appropriate quotes from some of the great poets and philosophers of the world. The society of these Change War denizens is sharply evoked as almost a side-discourse to the main story, a society that is rich and complex, and invites comparison to Asimov's The End of Eternity's rather sterile and compartmentalized one.  There is more meat packed into the slim bones of this work than many works four times its size manage to enfold.<br />A riveting tale, with suspense, drama, mystery, and an overarching structure that will make you think twice (and then perhaps again): \\"Familiar with infinite universe sheaths and open-ended postulate systems?\\" -a Heinlein quote used for the last chapter.

Battle against prejudice, against poverty, against class structures, against themselves. This, his last novel, once more places people in jeopardy. Covering a period from just before the Civil War to the early 1890's, it is a tale of honorable men fighting to save what they believe in, most noticeably Uris' beloved Marine Corps, but also fighting for a chance to live life and love as they wish, to acknowledge the right of all to be free, and for honor itself.<br />Zachary O'Hara is the model Marine; practically raised within the corps by his father, Paddy O'Hara, a Civil War Medal of Honor hero who, at one point or another, had saved most of the lives of the male characters in this book. Zachary must fight the battle common to children of famous parents, that of making his way in the world out from the shadow of his parent. His external battle takes the shape of drafting policy papers that will show the necessity of Marine Corps as a functioning part of the U. S. Military, both in the present time and in the foreseeable future, as in the late 1880's the general feeling was that the Marine Corps was a body that had outlived its usefulness.<br />But this battle must take place alongside his battle to be able to love Amanda Kerr, daughter of ship-building magnate Horace. As Zachary is clearly below Amanda's station, marriage would seem to be out of the question - but Amanda herself is a strong-willed, intelligent woman who knows how to broker deals.<br />With this as the skeleton upon which to construct his novel, it would seem that sure-handed Uris would have an easy time building a strong novel. But perhaps because Uris died before doing the final edits on this work, the novel comes off as somewhat disjointed, characters (especially the minor ones) not as clearly delineated as is normal for Uris, and occasional pieces of text are repeated, something I'm sure he would have eliminated had he had the chance. As it is, there are places that feel incomplete, dialogue that seems to assume the reader knows more than has been presented, and the prime story, that of ensuring the continuance of the Marine Corps, does not seem to carry the sense of urgency and criticality that I'm sure Uris intended the novel to portray.  The historical backdrop of both national events and his character's past does not have enough detail to really make this era come alive. The climax of the story comes as something of a surprise, as only minimal hints about it have been set in earlier portions of the novel.<br />What could have been a strong story of love and nation-building is compromised, leaving only the feeling of what could have been with perhaps another hundred pages and some strong editing.

This was the Good Doctor's response to Heinlein's seminal 'By His Bootstraps': a time travel novel that adds more to the mix than just man-goes-back-to-meet-his-grandfather.<br />Asimov envisions a society that has tasked itself with improving the lot of mankind by introducing carefully calculated changes in the time flow, a society of 'Eternals' that live outside of the normal time stream in their own environment constructed with full living habitats in each century, all powered by a thin line to the far future when our sun goes nova. It is a caste society, with each individual rigidly relegated to the status and job they are deemed best suited for, from Maintenance to Computer to Technician. The individuals are recruited from the normal time flow, as the Eternals, by their own rules, are forbidden to have children.<br />Andrew Harlan is one such recruit, who is quickly tabbed as having the emotional makeup and intellectual skills to be a Technician, one of those who actually implement changes in 'normal' time. Somewhat naive, a little bit of an aesthetic who is somewhat bothered by hedonistic societies that he is sometimes required to observe or change, he finds himself in a quandary when he falls in love with a lady from such a society. Determined to have her, he decides on actions that he knows might bring about the end of Eternity, for he has determined a great secret, just how Eternity was started in the first place.<br />Asimov unravels the mysteries and paradoxes of this situation in his usual inimitable style, carefully laying down the parameters of the problem, leaving clues lying about here and there (which Harlan, obsessed as he is, blithely ignores), all leading to a grand climax that gives new perspective to the traditional time paradox problem.  The idea of time 'inertia', where the effect of changes that are introduced to the time line slowly die out, is an interesting one, and is carefully folded into the plot line. Though other books envisioned a corps of people who manage time, the society shown here is better fleshed out than just about all previous attempts, not to be surpassed until Fritz Leiber's The Big Time. And possibly there would not be another better worked out 'solution' to the basic riddle of the time paradox until Heinlein's 'All You Zombies...' appeared. As an intellectual exercise, then, this book is excellent.<br />But as is also typical for Asimov, his characterization is somewhat weak, although he does a better job here than in some of his other works. Harlan is too one-dimensional, too driven, a little too arrogant about his own abilities, to be totally believable. Noys, his ladylove, is almost a nonentity, although she will become one of the lynch-pins of the final resolution. And Computer administrator Twissell is very close to a stereotype. Still, the characters are adequate to move the plot, and as this is an idea driven novel, not one of character, this failing is not fatal to the enjoyment of the book.<br />This is one of the very few Asimov novels that is not part of his Foundation or Robot sets.  Read it, if for no other reason, to see just what he could do outside of those confines.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)a corps of people who manage time, the society shown here is better fleshed out than just about all previous attempts, not to be surpassed until Fritz Leiber's The Big Time.

Heinlein's Stranger in a strange land	Books	4	53	55	N	N	The Martian Dissected	Works of criticism are not my normal fare, as I rarely listen to critics of any stripe, but I do make an exception for those pieces that refer to Heinlein, as I have consistently felt that he has never gotten the deep analysis that he deserves, and what little has been done has been sloppy and wrong-headed.<br /><br />In my opinion, for a critical work to be worth spending money on, it must provide the following:<br /><br />1. New insights into the internal structure and meaning of the work in question.<br />2. A good exposition of palpably discernable influences.<br />3. Valid comparisons to other works in the same milieu.<br />4. If applicable to the work in question, an investigation into the chronology of its writing and interrelationship with the author's life.<br />5. An analysis of what the author did right and what didn't work.<br /><br />How does this work stack up in light of these requirements?<br /><br />As a starting point, this work decides that the main structure of Stranger in a Strange Land is satire, which can work under different rules than, say, a novel of manners, romance, or confession, in terms of plot, character, and a host of other factors. As one of the main elements of satire is irony, most of this work is involved in identifying specific instances of this. The authors definitively point out that much of the book depends on sets of (apparently) polar opposites: Jubal (experience) versus Mike (innocence), The Church of All Worlds (Appolonian) versus the Fosterites (Dionysian), Jill and Dawn, the Carnival (heaven ) versus the Zoo (earth), etc. Also pointed out is the Heinlein tendency to structure his works in terms of starting from a point, logically expanding from the point, and then retreating back to the original point, now from a new perspective. In terms of meaning, this work clearly catches the fact that Stranger is intended to raise questions, not provide a blueprint for a new religion, and each of the points of irony or complement pairs shown here have a clear basis in the actual work. Thus in terms of the first requirement, this work did an excellent job, and it provides a strong basis for better analysis of Heinlein's later 'World as Myth' works. As exposed here, Stranger reveals depths, meanings, and complexities that are not directly obvious, a pattern of strongly sculpted variegated positions than can be very illuminating to the reader.<br /><br />The authors also do a good job of pointing out the influences on Heinlein, both literary and philosophical, not just in Stranger, but in many of his other works, showing a clear line to Mark Twain, Nietzsche, James Branch Cabell, and Korzybski. The (possible) relationship to Aleister Crowley (as analysed by Whence Came the Stranger: Tracking the Metapatterns of Stranger in a Strange Land) is also examined, without any definitive conclusions, but an opinion that this connection is somewhat unlikely. Happily, the authors clearly document the line to each of these influences, and don't try to force associations that may not be real. Surprising to me, however, was that no comment was made about Rudyard Kipling, to which Heinlein's work has been compared by multiple other critics.<br /><br />Good comparisons are made to other satires: Gulliver's Travels, A Modest Proposal, Tristam Shandy, and several others.<br /><br />There is a fairly long exposition of the germination and writing history of Stranger, along with the publishing conditions Heinlein was working under at the time, all relevant to the final form of the book. However, although there is considerable surprise expressed over the fact that both the original (cut) and expanded version are selling very well side by side, there is really no analysis of the differences between the two versions. But it does quite properly de-bunk the link between Charles Manson and Stranger.<br /><br />The last item on my list is, unfortunately, almost totally ignored. We not only do not get an overall evaluationof how Stranger stacks up versus the rest of the literary world, there is zero discussion of the flaws of the book. Instead there is a sharp discourse on the failings of other critical looks at this book. Tackled here is Panshin's Heinlein in Dimension and William Atheling Jr.'s (James Blish) The Issue at Hand, along with several others. I re-read these works to see if the criticisms of the criticisms were valid. In general, I agree with their assessments. Re-reading Panshin was an agony - in many cases it seems that Panshin just couldn't see the forest for the trees, most notably in his consistent panning of all four of RAH's Hugo winners. The very fact that these works did take the Hugo should have at least warned Panshin that his analysis was probably lacking or incorrect. The authors of this book take Panshin to task for his identification of a single Heinlein character type, finding this to be very dubious. Blish is attacked for wrongheadly describing the book as a religious tract, with the esthetics of an engineer-turned-writer.<br /><br />As an added bonus, there is an appendix to this book that lists at least some of the meanings of many of the character's names in Stranger, which is important to understanding some the ideas presented in the book.<br /><br />This book is obviously written as if intended for use in a literature class, using the rather arcane idiom of academic criticism (which can be rough going if you're not used to it), and complete with a set of reader questions and exercises at the end of each chapter. A minor annoyance is, at several places in the book, the exact same point is made, as if for the very first time. Some better editing should have caught this. A summation assessment of how well this book is written as a totality would also have helped.

Many were excellent explanations of various aspects of science written in language that a layman could understand. Some were good analyses of literature, such as Shakespeare and the Bible. But it is his science fiction works, from his vision of a Foundation to Robots imbued with Three Laws, that guarantee him a place in the hearts of fans of the genre, and a fame that spreads well beyond its boundaries.<br /><br />This book was something of a departure for him, not being related to any of his other SF works, but still shows his sure hand at plotting and his deft melding of real science with a literally out-of-this-world idea. The story is told in three completely different segments, related only by the commonality of the scientific idea that drives this book, the Electron Pump, a device that can, apparently, deliver infinite free energy by trading material with a universe that operates on slightly different physical laws than our own.<br /><br />The first segment is a beautiful glimpse into the sometimes not-so-nice world of the academic researcher, into who gets credit (not necessarily the deserving one) for an idea, how animosities begin and are nurtured, about the crassness of public policy being determined by those who do not and cannot understand the basics of the science that delivers the technological goodies.<br /><br />The second segment is the part that makes this book deserving of its Hugo Award.  Shifting from our universe to the para-universe that initiated the transfer that began the Electron Pump, Asimov invents a truly alien race that is at once believable and violently different from our own.  Here we meet Odeen, Tritt, and Dua, who each form one part of tri-sexed whole. Each of these beings becomes a real person, from Tritt, the stolid, stubborn parent, Odeen as the absent minded thinker, and most especially Dua as the feeling, capricious, different one. Part of what makes this section so seductive is that Asimov has not just stated that this was tri-sexed species, but shows just how such an arrangement could work, and then throws in something I don't think I saw elsewhere till some of Ursala K. LeGuin's stories - just what constitutes the no-no's, the 'dirty' aspects of their sex lives. And these aspects, when viewed in terms of the whole life cycle of this species, make sense! A truly remarkable achievement, and I wish he had written more about this remarkable universe and its inhabitants.<br /><br />The third section returns to our universe, and deals with how free investigation into reality guided by leaps of intuition can overcome even two separate hide-bound organizations, and naturally leads to the resolution of the problems introduced in the earlier sections. This section is not quite as strong as the other two, but does definitely develop one of Asimov's points: the characteristics of the universe we live in are determined by several seemingly random constants, from the strength of quark-quark interactions to the speed of light, and changing any of them would result in very radically different universes.<br /><br />A strong novel, with some excellent characterization within each section, and based on a solid bedrock of real science. This is possibly the best stand-alone fiction work that he wrote, and should be placed on your shelves right next the Foundation and Robot series.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)section so seductive is that Asimov has not just stated that this was tri-sexed species, but shows just how such an arrangement could work, and then throws in something I don't think I saw elsewhere till some of Ursala K.

This section is not quite as strong as the other two, but does definitely develop one of Asimov's points: the characteristics of the universe we live in are determined by several seemingly random constants, from the strength of quark-quark interactions to the speed of light, and changing any of them would result in very radically different universes.    A strong novel, with some excellent characterization within each section, and based on a solid bedrock of real science. This is possibly the best stand-alone fiction work that he wrote, and should be placed on your shelves right next the Foundation and Robot series.    --- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)	2003-12-13

Does it deserve such a placing? I think the answer to that depends upon what your viewpoint is about what science fiction, as a form of literature, is supposed to accomplish.<br /><br />The idea is simple enough. A new drug, developed from the bacteria that causes syphilis, is found to have the property of greatly increasing a person's intelligence, but with major side effect - it kills the user in about nine months. The story follows one Louis Sacchetti, a conscientious objector to a seemingly interminable war, and who would already be considered to be a genius by most standards, as he is transferred from a standard prison to a facility specially constructed to see what will happen to its inmates when given this drug. The story is told through the means of a journal that Louis is encouraged, almost forced, to keep.<br /><br />As this idea is extremely similar to that of Daniel Keyes' Flowers for Algernon (which was later made into the movie Charly), comparison is invited. Flowers emphasizes the tragedy of the hero, a man who struggles to find those bits of knowledge that will help not just himself but all mankind, up against an unbeatable problem, that of his own retreat to sub-normal intelligence again. Camp Concentration follows a completely different path, that of the essential selfishness of the individual, of nihilism, of the despair of ever being able to change humanity in any meaningful way. The inmates that Louis initially documents are apparently using their greatly enhanced intelligence to investigate alchemy as a means of providing immortality, not for humanity in general, but for themselves and the 'warden' of this prison, Humphrey Haast.  Louis, meanwhile, seems caught up in crafting new poems and a play, entitled 'Auswitch, A Comedy'. The title is indicative of something Disch does throughout this book, playing with names and titles to produce another layer of meaning behind the straightforward words, and is fairly effective in doing so.<br /><br />The tone is the primary thing here, a very dark, brooding atmosphere, enlivened by a very wide ranging vocabulary and many references, both buried and open, to other works of literature (most especially Dante), and scientific and psychological theories. Readers who are not familiar with these references may feel a little lost at places in this book - at least I did, as my breadth of knowledge in these areas is clearly more limited than Disch's. But from this tone, Disch develops his themes of the corruption of man, of his baser desires, the absolute horrors of what man is capable of, and where such capacity leads. As such, this book is almost the complete antithesis of Flowers for Algernon - that is, until the ending of this book.<br /><br />The ending of this book, I felt, rather drastically detracted from its overall message, as it doesn't seem to fit with the rest, and has a little of a deus-ex-machina feel to it. Given the many layered discourse that Disch presented in the rest of the book, which while sometimes difficult to follow, was certainly excellent writing, this ending was a disappointment.<br /><br />While this is certainly a major entry into the dystopian side of science fiction literature, whether it truly qualifies as a 'classic' will be, I'm afraid, very much a matter of opinion for a long time to come. But it is certainly worth reading, if for nothing else than to see the darker side of genius competently presented.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)aying with names and titles to produce another layer of meaning behind the straightforward words, and is fairly effective in doing so.

Having read everything ever published by him, the thought of having new words from the master of science fiction was a great lift to my spirits.  Now having this work in my hands, my happiness has not diminished, even though this 'novel' is fraught with flaws.  This work is not the place to start reading Heinlein; its place in his pantheon can only really be appreciated after having read many of his other works.<br /><br />In some ways, this work is something like H.G. Wells When the Sleeper Wakes, with its major plot line of Perry, a normal 1939 engineer, reviving after a car accident in the year 2086. With this as a starting point, much of the book focuses on the changes and events that have occurred during the intervening years. Presented here is a fascinating set of prognostications, from a united Europe (quite different from today's attempt at unification), to an America that took a brief fling with a religious autocracy. Hitler's final fate, and the duration of WWII, is eerily foretold. Some of the foreseen advances in technology are startling: advanced cooking methods, personal air-cars, rolling roads, even a primitive form of the internet  - some of which have actually come to pass, others seem just as far away as when this was written. A significant (and highly atypical) failure in prediction, though, is that by 2086, man had still not traveled to the moon.<br /><br />It is very clear that this was some of Heinlein's earliest attempts at writing, as just about all the above is presented as expository blocks of dialog by one or another of those people who have undertaken the task of bringing Perry up to date, rather than being material presented as part of the story, a trick he later mastered possibly better than any other science fiction writer. For those who have read some of Heinlein's other works, though, this material, even though it interrupts the story and is presented in large, nearly indigestible blocks, is fascinating. Here we see that Heinlein, in 1938, had already laid out most of the significant events of what would become his 'Future History', and several stories he would later write were directly mined from this material, including Beyond this Horizon, \\"If This Goes On\\", \\"Coventry\\", and \\"The Roads Must Roll\\".<br /><br />The story itself, which really only comprises about fifty pages of this work, deals with several items that would become the major subject material for many of his late-life works: the proper role of government versus private actions, economics, religion, what is love and jealousy, and alternative marriage forms. Perry falls in love with Diana, the person who first aided him, and runs afoul of the customs of the day when he takes a swing at one of Diane's former partners. His treatment for this infraction allows Heinlein to present many of his views on society and personal interactions. From this it can be seen that his focus on such material in books like Stranger in a Strange Land, Friday, and I Will Fear No Evil was not an aberration, but rather a continuation of thoughts and feelings he had always had, but couldn't publish during the forties and fifties due to various taboos. This was also probably at least one reason (besides its clumsy technique) why this book could not find a publisher in 1939, as its advocacy of free love and casual nudity would have certainly raised some hackles.<br /><br />As would always be typical of Heinlein's work, he presents some ideas that will challenge your own assumptions of how things should and do work, most especially in this work with his presentation on economics, banking, and taxation. Some additional reading from other sources about these economic ideas is recommended, as I think such reading in conjunction with what is presented here will provide a clearer picture of just how the world works today and how things might be modified for the better.<br /><br />As a novel, this book doesn't work very well, as it is essentially a short story bulked up with all of Heinlein's ideas about the future world. But those ideas scintillate and provide a great perspective from which to view all of his other work. Perhaps it is an irony that his first book should end up being his last published, but I for one am glad that I have had this opportunity to read this and see the genesis of so much that I greatly enjoyed.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)ified for the better.

As an alternate history where people have 'knacks' for doing things, from repairing barrels and bones to seeing the future, its fire came from its ideological underpinnings, of the fight between those who build and those who destroy, of machine versus nature, of the rights of all to be self-directing autonomous individuals versus the cultural assumption that some are better than others, and those inferior beings are suited only for slavery.  While much of this underpinning is highly relevant to this latest installment, it does not seem to bring with it the deep emotional involvement that would have made this story come alive.<br />Alvin Maker is the prime mover here, a man conflicted between his incredible abilities and the knowledge that regardless of how much he builds, however much good he can accomplish in the world, the Unmaker will be following right behind, tearing down all he can accomplish. Alvin's dream of a city built by Makers seems further and further off, as he becomes embroiled in actions to save many of the slaves and poor of the city of Nueva Barcelona (New Orleans) from both yellow fever (that he unwittingly helped to spread) and its other bigoted and superstitious citizens.  Almost as a side plot, his brother Calvin becomes embroiled in a foray by Steve Austin and Jim Bowie to conquer the Mexica, with Calvin's typical disregard for the consequences or moral rightness of his actions.<br />The depiction of the historical characters that dot this novel, from Abe Lincoln to Bowie, is definitely problematic. All of them seem to have no depth, all are portrayed with only the sheen of their legendary characteristics, from Abe's honesty to Bowie's fighting drive, with no signs of other human foibles that would have made these stick-figures into something real. The plot itself is reasonable, a modern alternate version of Exodus with Alvin as Moses, and its final resolution points the way towards where this series may ultimately be headed. But I found as I was reading that I was looking for something more concrete to the action; too little description, not enough supporting details, an almost dreamlike feel to what could have been a very gritty slice of life under very unappetizing conditions.<br />While Card has a long list of those people who helped check this manuscript for continuity errors with earlier volumes, and obviously their efforts did help eliminate most of those kinds of problems, I did find it a little amusing that the maps on the end papers clearly show Alvin's Crystal City located on the wrong side of the Mississippi river.<br />Card does manage to make most of his moral points without clobbering you over the head with them, and some of the final section shows at least a willingness to concede that not all that is man-made is bad or that all that is nature-derived is good. But the fire that drove the earlier books, of their implied Great War between good and evil, is not here. Clearly, Card is planning at least one more book in this set, where perhaps the anticipated and long delayed war against slavery will combine with Alvin's dream of a better world to form a heart-wrenching finale.  I do hope so.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)ble, a modern alternate version of Exodus with Alvin as Moses, and its final resolution points the way towards where this series may ultimately be headed.

He has also done a great deal to bring the world of science fiction back into the field of recognized literature through essays and articles that have shown its richness, its ingenuity, its relationships with other forms of literature, and its ability to, at its best, illuminate the human condition in a fashion impossible in other forms.<br /><br />This is an autobiographical rendering of his life from about age 14 to age 22. As might be supposed from his fictional writings, Delany is revealed to be both brilliant and highly unconventional. From his inter-racial marriage to Marilyn Hacker (who would later win a National Book Award for her poetry) at a time when such marriages where practically unheard of, to his awakening sexual predilections, this book is fascinating in its straight-forward directness, never avoiding describing events in detail regardless of how much the events were taboo or not mentioned in polite company.<br /><br />Set with Delany's inimitable style, his ability to evoke pictures with words and seasoned with excerpts from some of Marilyn's (and his own) poems, Motion paints an indelible portrait of the tail end of the 'beat' era and the beginning of the 'hippie' movement. I found myself saying, yes, that is exactly how it was (even though Delany is six years older than me), as his work evoked some of my own memories of my early years away from home, living in a rat-trap with little income, the first experiences of actually living with a woman, the community of young people that wove around and over you, the passions and idealisms of youth.<br /><br />On top of this, Delany lays forth the genesis of his early works, both their writing and his difficulties in getting them published. Some of the characters and situations of his novels take on a new light after reading this, seeing how much of himself Delany put into those characters.  We find that Delany also has other talents besides writing: musician (once headlined above Bob Dylan), actor, and poet.<br />As they say in the movies: Warning: this book contains explicit sex scenes, both heterosexual and homosexual. Those who are offended by such should not read this book.  But those who do read it will be rewarded with a great tale of life told with pin-point accuracy and all the emotion of great poetry.<br /><br />This book took the 1989 Hugo for best science-fiction related non-fiction work, and it fully deserved it.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick (hyperpat)after reading this, seeing how much of himself Delany put into those characters.

The end of civilization, indeed the death of man himself, due to his constant meddling with the environment, other life forms, and his own germ plasm have been envisaged many times before. This book remains a cut above most earlier attempts, as it adds a very believable human face to the disaster, ties it to both man's dreams and his nightmares, and wraps it inside a potent love triangle.<br /><br />From the beginning of this book, where we meet Snowman, possibly the last true human, living in a tree and dependent on the half-human Children of Crake, till the very end of this book, where the full horror of the situation is clearly exposed, there is a sense of inevitability to events, a clear line to its envisioned world from the headlines of today. As Snowman tells his tale via flashbacks to his own past, a picture is developed of technology both fighting and aiding the deleterious effects of prior technologies. From the global warming induced drowning of the coasts and the collapse of world's resources abilities to feed an ever-growing population, to terrorist and greedy corporations designs of new diseases and environmentally harmful crosses of various animal species, each element piles on to background structure. In the foreground we follow Jimmy (Snowman's original name) and his childhood friend Glenn (Crake) as they go through school and find jobs as part of the elite, those whose mental abilities make them employable by the movers and shakers of the world, the genetic research laboratories.  During their joint exploration of the internet, they run into Oryx, a child prostitute, who will eventually figure prominently in their lives.<br /><br />Crake is a very interesting character, a super-genius who keeps his own emotions hidden, sometimes even from himself, as he first conceives of and then implements the idea of designing a better human. A human who is not subject to wild emotional swings of love, who will not have the need to defend property as he will live on grass and sunshine, who will be carefully isolated from any contact with violence-causing ideas such as 'God' and 'mine'. But Crake is not immune to being human himself, and is in fact dependent on others, primarily Oryx and Jimmy, which is really his flaw. Jimmy is the perennial follower, but when forced to take charge, his actions become the final lynch-pin in the ultimate disaster and his tales the beginning of a new mythology. Oryx is the ultimate woman, fully caring and giving, perhaps too much so, without the ability to turn others to a line of action of her choosing - but perhaps she never wished to.  These characters grew on me as I learned more about them, as each had characteristics I could see in myself, different parts of a mirror.<br /><br />The power of this book lies in the dynamic between the dream and the practical, between the intent and the result, between the giving and receiving of love. There are several layers of meaning and symbol buried within its fairly conventional story, layers that built an emotionally powerful edifice in my mind, an edifice completed with the last scene of this book.

Day after day, it seems the violence in this area of the world never ends. We read of seemingly endless peace proposals whose terms towards the Palestinians look generous that are rejected out of hand. And we wonder: why? How can this situation be changed? Can Arab and Jew ever find a solution they both can live with?<br /><br />In The Haj, Uris has attempted to show some of the reasons behind today's problems. Told from the Arab viewpoint, within its fictional confines it details some of the historical events of this area from just before World War I to the 1956 Arab-Israeli conflict. As Uris is well known for portraying Jews in a very favorable light, the immediate question springs to mind of just how unbiased he could be with this portrayal, an item that should probably be kept in the back of your mind while reading this, and further reading from other sources should be used to confirm the historical facts presented here.<br /><br />But the picture Uris paints of the Arab culture and history rings with veracity. The story follows the family of Haj Ibrahim, mainly concentrating on the father himself and his son Ishmael. Haj Ibrahim is the leader of the small village of Tabah, a position he obtained by force over his older brother. The depiction of Haj as patriarch, whose word within the family is absolute law, who as leader must never show cowardice or lose face, is striking. The position of women within the Arab society, the importance of the teachings of the Q'uran to their daily lives, the relative value of a `book' education, are all shown within the dynamics of this family. It is this portrait of the culture, steeped in a history going back 3,000 years, that is the fundamental lynch-pin of this story, as Uris shows just how the culture and its expectations for individual behavior shape the events of history. His portrait of the British exercise of the Palestinian Mandate is damning, but is placed side-by-side with the internal squabbling of the various Arab tribes, and even the Jewish Haganah comes in for some harsh words.<br /><br />But most relevant to today's situation are the events that followed immediately after the 1948 declaration of independence of the Israeli state, when Haj and his entire village evacuate in anticipation of the invasion of Arab armies. Here is the genesis of the Palestinian problem, as the thousands of Arab refugees are forcibly contained in various camps, with no resources, no facilities, and aid packages from foreign countries are systematically confiscated by the Arab `governments' (often shown as merely the latest strong man who has managed to briefly seize power). But worse is the fact that, contrary to their heritage, within these camps Arab would not help Arab, no single leader would be accepted, no efforts were made by their inhabitants to improve conditions, as the camps were temporary, surely soon the Arab world would drive the Jews into the sea and they could return to their homes. It is from these conditions, along with constant hate-filled rhetoric from various Arab leaders, that the terrorist groups of today were formed.<br /><br />The story Uris tells is powerful, its illumination of the reasons for today's conditions brilliant. It does not have quite the emotional power of his Exodus or Mila-18, nor yet the sweeping portrayal of the thousands of years of history of the area so well portrayed by Michener's The Source, but it will leave you with a better understanding of a culture and people who are shaking many of the events of today.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)side-by-side with the internal squabbling of the various Arab tribes, and even the Jewish Haganah comes in for some harsh words.

But...<br /><br />First, this book works very well as an historical novel, detailing not just all the court intrigues swirling around England, France and the Netherlands in the late 17th century, along with the associated historical characters of King Louis XIV, William of Orange, King Charles and James, Cromwell, Pepys, Jeffreys, etc., but also the incredible explosion of scientific research embodied in the persons of Newton, Hooke, Leibnitz, Wilkins, Huygens, Bernoulli, and multiple others. The depiction of the experiments performed by these men is not only educational, but takes trips over into the gross, the incredible, the fantastic, the grimly humorous, with Neal's patented brand of the sublimely ridiculous. How these things interweave with things like the Black Death of London in 1665 and the Great Fire one year later, the beginnings of modern day financial markets, the various and sundry religious factions and the important philosophical questions of the day (questions which still have great relevance today), is a tapestry that is built thread by thread by Neal.<br /><br />The characters that Neal dwells on may ring some bells with those who have read Cryptonomicon (and the Cryptonomicon figures as a work in progress within this book). Enoch Root makes several appearances here - perhaps the question might be if he is really the same person as in his earlier book? His major characters of Daniel Waterhouse, Jack Shaftoe, and Eliza are well drawn and engaging, though perhaps some of their actions are a little too much over-the-top to be totally believable. But be prepared for the incredibly large cast - so large that the provided list of personae in the rear of the book is not only useful, but almost mandatory to being able to keep everyone straight, especially as many people are referred to by multiple names and various titles. Also useful are the (simplified) family trees of the major royal lines, helping to place in perspective the various relationships between these people (near incestuous, in some cases).<br /><br />Neal takes some trips into literary lands he has not previously dwelt in - from satirical plays to poems and songs, some of which work, some of which come off as a little flat. His depictions of the hygiene and medical 'science' of the day may be off-putting to some, being gross in the extreme. There are places where his descriptions of the everyday, such as the latest high fashions in clothing, are absolutely hilarious - satire that shows by contrast just how silly some things humans engage in are, not just then but also today. London and its surrounding area is vividly described, to the point where I felt I was walking down those streets, seeing and smelling it as it really was. At the same time, I felt that Versailles was not given proper attention, a lack of detailed description of one of the most impressive palaces ever built.

My only real objection to this book is that it's obviously only a part of the story - many plot threads are not finished, probably to be picked up again in the later two books.<br /><br />This is not a book for everyone. But for those who have interests in both history and science, this book is a marvelous trip to a time that did much to shape the world of today.

I just hope that the succeeding novels live up to the promise of this one.    --- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)	2003-10-27

But for 'George Smith' (not his real name), the officers at this base decided this would be an appropriate place.  As the overworked ward was back in the States, a long ways from the fisticuffs, and the battered officer was killed shortly thereafter, it perhaps can be understood how George was locked up for three months without anyone seeing him. When he does finally become the object of attention, the battle cry is to get him out of there as quickly as possible, so the psychiatrist's time can be more usefully spent on those who have real problems. All that's required is to write up a nice sounding diagnosis, declare him cured, and discharge him. In pursuit of something on which to base his diagnosis, the psychiatrist asks George to write up his life history, in third person if that will help him tell his story truthfully.<br /><br />It is here, with this autobiography, that Sturgeon starts to show just how brilliant a writer he was. Sturgeon often portrayed some the world's less fortunate in his stories, always with empathy and a way of making his readers see the portrayed character as a person, not as an object. Just so here, as George's story is deftly told, simple and in the appropriate vernacular of a poor kid of somewhat limited education. George was raised by a drunkard, abusive father and invalid mother, and his only relief from the abuse was his walks in the local woods, where he learned to hunt small game. As he matures, he becomes involved with Anna, eight years his senior. Eventually, in trying to please his father, he ran afoul of the law, and was placed in a juvenile home, and eventually joined the Army, where he seemed to fit quite well, until the incident with the officer.<br /><br />At this point, I felt that here was a person who had been inappropriately placed in a mental institution, a quiet, reserved person who had somehow been pushed beyond a breaking point and for once let his anger dominate his actions. Here is where the real story starts, as the psychiatrist, reading George's account, feels there is something missing, something that George hasn't told, and he unfolds the arsenal of tools available to him to try and determine just what is missing. What is finally revealed about George is not only shocking and horrifying to the point of keeping me awake long after I finished this book, but also shows just how superb a job Sturgeon did in crafting George's 'autobiography', as again and again, certain mannerisms of expression, things that were not said, and things that were said but not taken literally are shown to be the keys to the real George. Sturgeon does not need the normal trappings of a horror novel here - there are no ghosts, no voices, no elements of the paranormal - rather we have something that is totally believable, and for that reason it is even more horrifying.<br /><br />For once, psychiatry is shown capable of doing what it is supposed to do, a success story in a field littered with ultimate failures and partial insights, and perhaps this element is the weakest thing here - things go too well, too easily for the psychiatrist. The ending was a little too upbeat, perhaps, and Sturgeon made one slip that I thought was unnecessary, just too obvious, when he revealed that George's real name is 'Bela'. These are minor flaws in an otherwise excellent book that can make you really feel just how horrifying the world and some people who populate it can be.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)er dominate his actions.

In the far future, when man has risen to giddy heights of technological accomplishments and due to insufferable pride has fallen back again, where Guilds segment man into carefully disparate work and life styles, the Guild of the Flyers is the only one devoted to pure esthetic enjoyment. A product of gene tinkering during man's great Second Cycle, the flyers can fly only at night, with wings so delicate even the pressure of sunlight is too much for them.<br />But the story is not about Flyers, or the Watchers who scan the universe with mentally enhancing machines looking for signs of the promised Invaders, nor even about the Dominator's rights to command material wealth and people for their own desires, but rather is almost a paean to what is best about the inner soul of man. Told from the viewpoint of one Watcher as he wanders a recognizable but very changed world from our own, from Roum to Perris to Jorslem, it is a voyage of self-discovery, of a delving into man's long past, while lust, greed, and acts of betrayal form signposts along his path towards redemption. A redemption for not just himself, but for all mankind, when it can recognize that all types of humans, including the most grossly misshapen Changelings as well as the most gorgeous Flyers, are part of man, and are all worthy.<br />Silverberg populates his world with some very real people. The character of the Watcher, later given the name Tomis by the Rememberers, is finely drawn, that of a man somewhat distanced from the world, an observer, who none the less has to come to grips with the realities of living, and who can find true love if he looks hard enough. The Prince of Roum is immediately recognizable if not very likable. Avluela the Flyer embodies all the traditional traits of the fragile, mysterious, inconstant female until she is revealed to have more depth and strength than is readily apparent.<br /> There is something of a baroque and romantic feel to the style, ornate yet conveying its meaning quite directly. Silverberg went from being something of a wordsmith-for-hire in his early years as a writer to a consummate tale spinner with a near poetic drive to his language, and this work shows that talent. In this work, he reminds me somewhat of Arthur C. Clarke's The City and the Stars, as both works deal with a very far future where mankind that has fallen from great heights, and they both have an aura of the immense pressure of millennia of history pressing on their stories.<br />Dominating the book is Silverberg's theme, against which his characters play and help illuminate. Normally this theme is gradually, almost imperceptibly developed, but perhaps the very last section of the book develops too much of a missionary fervor, about the only real miscue in this entire work.<br />With the first section of this book the winner of 1969 Hugo Award, this is a rich read, one to savor for its strangeness and yet its link to the commonplace, finely crafted to make believable the incredible, with emotional power and indelible images.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)e and romantic feel to the style, ornate yet conveying its meaning quite directly.

And also lyrical, simple, emotional, indelible. All characteristics of Hemingway's writing, all present in this book. A simple story of Harry Morgan, sometime fisherman forced into smuggling and illegal immigration just to feed his family, a man who spirals down the slippery road of 'the end justifying the means' till there is nothing left but survive at any cost.<br /><br />The story is told as three separate time-segments in Harry's life, which forces a certain disjointedness to the tale. But it also allows Hemingway to illuminate Harry's story with different segments of the Cuban and Key West societies at different times with changing social conditions.  There are many character vignettes, people captured sometimes in only a few paragraphs, people who are desperate, silly, egotistical, idealistic, cynical, worn-out, greedy, dissolute, resigned, driven, and just coping. Albert, a man doing relief work for less than subsistence wages, is one of the clearest and most poignant images, hiring on as mate to Henry even though he knows the voyage is supremely dangerous. Within this short portrait of this man, we see not only the extremes that desperation will drive a man to, but also Hemingway's commentary on social/political organizations and economic structures that give rise to such desperation. This was quite typical of Hemingway, as he never beat his reader's over the head with his political philosophy, but showed the underpinnings of his reasoning through the circumstances of his characters.<br /><br />Throughout this work, there is the sense that there is more here than what the words on the page delineate, a theme of people from all walks of life and all economic circumstances who are caught in the implacability of fate. All of these people have their own dreams, their own methods of dealing with the vagaries of life, and each is limned by the ultimate depression of life limited to only a short span.<br /><br />Morgan's wife, though relegated to only a small part on these pages, shines through as one of the most engaging and durable people here, supportive of her husband's dreams, willing to forgo anything more than minimal material wealth, able to put aside her husband's foibles, and having the inner strength to continue when all her world collapses around her. The contrast between her and many of the other characters here is striking, a fine illustration of what really comprises the 'haves' and the 'have nots'.<br /><br />This book is not as powerful as For Whom the Bell Tolls, mainly due to its fragmented story structure and lack of any clear objective for its main characters, but is still a fine book with many nuances hiding within its simple story.  This is not a book for those who like happy, uplifting stories, but it does much to illuminate both the best and the worst of humanity's fight with the curse of living and the insurmountable wall of dying.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)nly a small part on these pages, shines through as one of the most engaging and durable people here, supportive of her husband's dreams, willing to forgo anything more than minimal material wealth, able to put aside her husband's foibles, and having the inner strength to continue when all her world collapses around her.

Having saved the universe twice and the Earth at least three times, does he now get a little break from busybody bureaucrats? Of course not - mainly because, if he did, Spider would have had no story to tell. So we open this latest segment in the Callahan saga with the entrance of the bureaucrat from hell in the person of Senior Field Inspector Czrjghbczl of the Florida Department of Education, wondering just what is being done about the education of Erin, Jake's daughter, and if her home environment is conducive to producing a fine, wholesome, upstanding lady. Of course, Jake's explanation of the situation is upstaged by his rather non-standard denizens of The Place, especially by the talking dog Ralph and the equally unusual deer Alf, and the sudden appearance of Erin herself, sans clothes - and then things really start to go downhill.<br />One problem is never enough for a Callahan novel, so the appearance of Tony Donuts, Jr. demanding protection money is par for the course.  To fully appreciate the gravity of the appearance of this persona, you need to have read Callahan's Lady, but even without that benefit, this current incarnation of the man-mountain is suitably threatening and just bright enough to foil simple solutions.<br />The early portion of this book, where the above situations are laid out, is hilariously funny, replete with Spider's trademark groan-inducing puns, fractured syntax, tall tales, incredible characters, biting satire, and song spoofs - Spider at his best. But when he turns to how to solve these twin problems, some of the fun seems to go away. The 'con' that The Place gang of very unusual beings comes up with is far from original (how many have been scammed by being sold the whereabouts of The Fountain of Youth?), although the particular implementation of this scam has some very unique aspects. When the Donut problem is solved, Spider now invents a new problem - his wife has gone time-travelling (without appropriate spatial correction) in an attempt to find out what was going on with her daughter while operating the scam. And the only way to find her calls for, once more, (and one time too many), the gang to get together in a telepathic group bond. This seemed to me to be unnecessary padding, and the real ending to the story would have read just as well without this incident thrown in.<br />There are multiple references throughout this book to happenings in other Callahan books, many insider  jokes from the SF field, and even at one point an underhanded reference to Spider's musical recordings (he has a fine voice that should be more well-known, but such are the vagaries of the music business). All rather standard for a Callahan novel, but I did feel he may have overdone it a little in this one, possibly making it difficult for someone who hasn't read the rest of the Callahan books to completely follow and understand the relevance of these earlier happenings to the current goings-on.<br />The ending is something of a tear-jerker, though underplayed and very quietly done, and shows the other side of Spider - emotionally sensitive, thoughtful, fully aware of not only man's foibles but his occasional grandeur, and with something important to impart to his readers.  Beyond the jokes, puns, and side-splitting tales, this is what keeps me coming back to Spider, and lifts this book back up from the trough in the middle section to being not only enjoyable but worthwhile.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)(without appropriate spatial correction) in an attempt to find out what was going on with her daughter while operating the scam.

So when I did finally haul this down and began reading, I found I had great difficulty remembering all that had gone before in the prior three volumes. Elliott does not help very much in this regard, as the opening section of the book begins with a totally new situation in a much earlier time-frame (about 13,000 years earlier), and takes one of the major characters of the first three books and transports him into this era. When she does return to the time and place of King Henry and Wendar, she still does not provide any summary of earlier actions but picks up the action from where she left off in The Burning Stone. So for a quite some time, I found myself very confused and lost.<br />But as I read a little further, I found my memory of her characters, Sanglant, Liath, Hanna, Anne, Hugh, Stronghand, Alain and several others, coming back to me, which says quite a bit about these character's vividness and uniqueness. It is in fact just such strong characterization that is Elliot's strong suit in this saga, which she continues to display with the new character of Adica, vibrant and personable, in this volume, along with continued development of all her former people.<br />What is not so good is the seemingly interminable plot line of the war for succession of the Wendar realm, with King Henry out to solidify his claim to the title of Emperor, Sanglant off fighting the latest invaders of the realm, and Hugh and Anne busily scheming to prevent any possible reconciliation with the Aoi. Liath is off on her own personal journey of self-discovery, with very little interaction with the other plot threads, though there are some revelations about her history near the end that promise some fireworks in later books of this set. It seems to take forever for Elliott to present the origins of the war between the Aoi and humans and how the current situation developed, although these points once presented finally start to give her world a logical, consistent framework. At the same time, some of the mystery and magic of these works is lost with this explanation. The story arc with Adica and Alain is the best thread in this work, fresh, original, and with its details of daily living and technological level well thought out, but once again I felt this story was stretched out too long, with too many incidents that have little relevance to main story.<br />Also missing is the cross-cultural viewpoints on religion and the reasons for living that added so much depth to the earlier works, these items seeming to now be taken for granted and with nothing new added by this volume.<br />At over 900 pages, and with so little real action, this book was in obvious need of some severe pruning. As it is, it is an overlong bridge book in which the fire and excitement of the first three has died down to embers, which hopefully can be re-ignited in the next book.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)ent situation developed, although these points once presented finally start to give her world a logical, consistent framework.

But, though rare, it did exist, and this novel explores one such case, and by doing so helps provide a more complete picture of the Known World, another window into that era and by reflection a vision of the current world.<br /><br />Perhaps most noticeable at the beginning of the book is the style it is told in. This is not a linear narrative with a well-defined protagonist and a clear-cut set of problems. Instead, Jones jumps from character to character, backward and forward in time, sometimes with his focus on an individual, sometimes reading more like an academic treatise documenting historical occurrences - often doing so even within a single paragraph. Because of this style and the sheer number of characters that are introduced or casually mentioned (over a hundred of them), it is very difficult to get quickly engrossed in this work. Not until almost a hundred fifty pages in does a coherent picture emerge and the characters coalesce from names into being people.<br /><br />But what does finally emerge is a picture of just how 'free' blacks could really be in that time. Though legally able to buy and sell others, the rights of this miniscule class of people did not extend to the full protection of the law - although as clearly shown here, it didn't extend to many others as well: the poor, the half-breeds, even women as a class.  Entry into 'society' is clearly denied, even though some of them were well respected for their skills and general level-headedness. And they always had to carry their papers proving their freedom - in a world where only a few were literate, this is quite an irony as well as being degrading. Perhaps most disturbing was the incident of Augustus Townsend, who purchased his own freedom and then that of his wife and son, respected as one of the best furniture makers in the county, who is sold back into slavery not for any malfeasance on his part, but merely due to the malice of a 'slave patroller' - and the only action taken against the patroller is a 'talking to'.<br />Conditions of that time are shown almost as a sidelight to the story: the prevalence of diseases now unheard of, the very short life expectancy, working hours from before dawn to after dark, the casual attitude towards worker injuries - highlighted by the 'insurance' policy sold to the wife of Henry Townsend after his death.<br /><br />The climax of this novel does not come as any surprise, as Jones has left multiple clues and forshadowings throughout the earlier portions of the work, but it is extremely depressing, pointing out in no uncertain terms just how inhumane all too many people are, and how little an individual can do to change his own circumstances.<br /><br />Though clearly well-researched and with a powerful story at its heart, I found the style to be quite a detriment to the story's overall impact. Though the mosaic formed by this style does eventually become a large picture of that time and place, it necessarily means there is no tight focus, and difficulty in presenting any depth of character.

This first book in this compilation has something of an underground cult level of fame, due to its limited availability for so long. Recent re-issues and its inclusion in this volume have finally rectified this situation. But does the work itself really live up to its word-of-mouth brilliance? Although different and well written, it is not in the same category as other fantasy classics like Lord of the Rings or The Last Unicorn.<br />The main character, Jame, as a young woman who cannot remember much of her recent past, but finds she has strange abilities and a mission to deliver a sword, ring, and book to Torisien, is very well drawn. Her entry into the city of Tai-Tastigon is not only very darkly flavored but brings a strong touch of horror to the reader, at least partially due to the reader not knowing precisely what is going on at that point. But as the story progresses, the vital uniqueness of the beginning slowly subsides into near-standard revelations of Jame's past and ancestral heritage; the multiple gods of the city, when seen close-up, lose some of their awe-inspiring flavor; and the basic plot devolves into rather simple lines. The battle between the inn that has become Jame's adoptive home and its across the street competitor, another battle for control of the Thieves Guild, and Jame's search for the meaning behind all the gods, her past, and the relics she holds in trust for Torisien form these lines, unfortunately all rather predictable, but they are well woven together. The resolution of all of them makes for a very satisfying conclusion to this book - far better than the conclusions of most opening volumes of long fantasies, making this book stand very well on its own.<br />Stylistically nicely written, without too many made-up words that seem to plague most fantasies, but with enough strangeness to let you know that this is not your everyday world, and a smoothness to the tale-telling that will carry you along without a bobble of something sharply out of place. Characterization of characters other than Jame seemed a little thin, but neither are they just cardboard cut-outs.<br />Overall, a nice start to a fantasy series, but much of its promise fades before the end, though having a real conclusion to this opening book is a definite plus in this world of seemingly never-ending fantasy works.<br />&quot;Bones&quot;, the included short story, is something of a sidelight to the main story started above, but adds some depth of insight into Jame's character.<br />In the second book here, Dark of the Moon, we get to meet Jame's brother Torisien, who shows up as quite different from what Jame expected. More than anything else, this second book is one of political intrigue, something Jame is not good at, being essentially naive at such machinations. But being thrown into this game forces Jame to grow, to more carefully consider the consequences of her actions.<br />More of the underlying forces, beings, and history of this world are slowly revealed here, most especially the 'Builders' and those who belong to the Perimal Darkling. These revelations and their intertwining with the action of this story are the best items here, leading logically to decisions and actions by Jame that make at least a convoluted sense. There is more depth to the secondary characters, and more urgency to the plot.

But as it contains some examples of Varley at his best, and his best is at the top of the field, it is an important collection for any serious fan of his, and good reading for everyone.<br /><br />\\"The Pusher\\" is a very quiet story that will bring to the fore some unconscious assumptions most people have when hearing about an adult male interacting with an pre-adolescent female.

A unique look at a problem that just might be somewhere in humanity's future.<br /><br />The title story, \\"Blue Champagne\\", didn't do very much for me, though it shows a remarkable imagination in its construction of a very unique champagne 'glass' and a very different approach to help for nerve damage that the medical profession is only now beginning to attempt. But it should be read before the next story \\"Tango Charlie and Foxtrot Romeo\\" both for some common background elements and a shared character. \\"Tango\\" is the best story here, an achingly emotional story about a girl raised in isolation by a computer on a space station that had been decimated by a plague so virulent that it was projected to wipe out all human life if it ever escaped from the station. Now the station's orbit is deteriorating and it must be destroyed, and the girl can't be rescued. Finely written, with some twists that are not expectable, and not overplayed.<br /><br />\\"Press Enter \\" is the Hugo and Nebula Award winning story that will make all the believers in world-wide conspiracies, mystery fans, and the computer nerds very happy. This is a more plot driven story than some of the others here, but with more than enough character to engage your heart as well as your mind.<br /><br />The only truly insignificant story here is \\"The Manhattan Phone Book (Abridged)\\", which is a compilation of very short vignettes of representative people from that book, who no longer exist. Happily it's a really short story. The rest of the stories are what I call average; quite readable and enjoyable, but not ones that will make you sit up and take notice or remember for very long.<br />There is something of a theme that runs through many of the stories here, that of the alienated, isolated individual trying to cope with the world, which gives these stories a feeling of darkness, a somberness tempered by Varley's resolutions to his character's problems.<br />A good introduction to Varley for those who haven't read any of his other work, with enough excellent stories to make you want to come back for more, and will repay your time spent reading with an expanded view of both the world and the human condition.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)which is a compilation of very short vignettes of representative people from that book, who no longer exist.

Horrifying, believable situations with potential for destroying the world! These are the things that Clancy became known for with his early books in the Jack Ryan series, from The Hunt for Red October to Executive Orders. Unfortunately, since then, new books in the series have lost one or more of those fine elements, leaving me wondering if the same man wrote the current work and those earlier ones.<br />This one starts well, introducing some much needed new characters, Jack Ryan's twin nephews Dominic and Brian Caruso, a Marine and an FBI agent, and his son Jack Jr. The situation is post 9/11, Jack Sr. is now the 'retired' President, and terrorism is the natural and quite believable focus of this work. Clancy's initial description of the collusion between a South American drug cartel and Islamic terrorists is precise and fits well with the real world. The mindset of the terrorists who are chosen to actually carry out the 'message' that no place in America is safe from them is well portrayed. By this point I was all set for another great thriller, wondering if Jack Jr. and his cousins can figure out the threat and deploy counter-measures in time - but it didn't happen. Instead we are treated to a near impossible coincidence of the nephews just happening to be at the right place at the right time, an intelligence analysis by Jack Jr. that drives from one marginal ID of a player in the terrorist plot all the way to the second-level king-pin - again with too much coincidence to be believable, and a 'solution' where everything goes exactly as planned, with no suspense at all.<br />Jack Jr. and the twins are reasonably portrayed, though not in the depth we have come to expect of Clancy, and they all do more soul-searching about the morality of killing obvious threats to society than I thought was healthy. It is also perhaps too much of a stretch that these three relatives would all come together as part of this counter-terrorist group, and that there is no media observance of Jack Jr.'s actions. His top-level villains are not so well defined, having too much vagueness about their background and how they came to their current way of thinking to make them into real people for me.<br />Along the way, Clancy makes points about the ability of the various intelligence agencies to crack most of the available encryption codes for e-mail via a combination of back-door programming entries and some brute force computing power. This is something I'm not at all sure is close to the reality - if it is then why are these agencies consistently supporting legislation to limit encryption algorithms and want to have a requirement for government-held secondary keys (not to mention the right to unlimited wiretaps and access to ISP's user data). But it is clear that Clancy is saying that the only way to defeat terrorism is to have such abilities, regardless of what such items would do to the right to privacy.  In fact, with his 'solution' to terrorism, Clancy seems to be advocating the complete abrogation of the rule of law, that an individual's judgement of another's fitness for elimination is enough, without recourse to the courts.<br />This book is slightly better than the last, Red Rabbit, mainly due to breath of fresh air of his new characters, but suffers from the same major fault, that all the planned actions go exactly as planned, there are no mistakes, no random happenstances that upset the plans, and thus removing any suspense.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)that there is no media observance of Jack Jr.'s actions.

MacLeod has shown a fine sense of how to blend political philosophy with storytelling in his prior works. No less so here, with this tale of an alternate history where WWIII began in 1949, where Joe Stalin is the peoples revolutionary hero, atomic weapons have been used in many more places than Hiroshima, and the Americans are flying some very strange bombers with even stranger pilots.<br />The book follows John Matheson from a young boy through early manhood, tracing his awakening to the political facts of life. And like many young people, the inequalities and suffering that much of world must live with are open sores that he feels he can and should do something about. This is the entry point for MacLeod's exposition of political/revolutionary solutions, along with some rather sharp satire of figures that are almost deified in our world (\\"Hey, hey, JFK, how many kids did you kill today?\\"). These answers will disturb your sense of the correctness of the status quo, perhaps make you realize that there is merit in other political philosophies than your own. Very little of this is presented directly, but is rather shown as an normal outgrowth of Matheson's development and learning, from his days in school and college and later as a member of the revolutionary group The Human Front. MacLeod's envisioned world is believable, and its contrasts with our own highlight just how much the world's and your personal condition depends upon chance happenstances and events beyond any one individual's control.<br />All of this, about the first fifty pages, is excellent writing, but at the end of the book MacLeod turns away from what should be the logical conclusion to the story and instead chooses what felt to me like a dues-ex-machina resolution, (even though MacLeod has carefully planted clues to this early in the book), and a far too happy one at that. For me, this ending greatly lessened the strength of his earlier points. Those familiar with the various science-fictional treatments of alternate time-line scenarios will recognize in this ending an attempt to rationalize the paradoxes inherent in disturbing the past and will see parallels with books like Asimov's The End of Eternity and Dick's The Man in the High Castle, but what is missing from this ending is a proper resolution to the political questions raised in the earlier portion of the book.<br />Perhaps this novella should have been given a longer treatment, expanded to full novel length, and with this extra room there would have been space to fill in what I feel was missing to this ending.  As it is, I feel that MacLeod has presented a sharply realized different world that can illuminate many of the problems of our world, but hasnt really finished his story within that world.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)eatments of alternate time-line scenarios will recognize in this ending an attempt to rationalize the paradoxes inherent in disturbing the past and will see parallels with books like Asimov's The End of Eternity and Dick's The Man in the High Castle, but what is missing from this ending is a proper resolution to the political questions raised in the earlier portion of the book. <br />Perhaps this novella should have been given a longer treatment, expanded to full novel length, and with this extra room there would have been space to fill in what I feel was missing to this ending.

So this collection is a nice treat, allowing you to see multiple samples of his writing at a length that gives enough room for full development of his ideas without having to slog through several thousand pages of an equivalent number of novels.<br /><br />\\"Looking for Kelly Dahl\\" is probably the best piece here, a strongly imagined tale of an alcoholic suicidal teacher who has a very odd meeting of the minds with one of his former students. The story highlights Simmons' skills at characterization while maintaining a very literary air, a deeply psychological story that emphasizes just how great the rift is between two people really trying to know each other.<br /><br />\\"On K2 with Kanakaredes\\" is another excellent piece, taking a standard mountain climbing story and elevating it to a story of earned respect for all intelligences.  Some very strong characterization for both the narrator and the alien, and Simmons' own respect for the great mountains of this world comes through very clearly.<br /><br />\\"The Ninth Av\\" is a rather chilling story, as the remaining 'humans', all of Jewish descent, wait for the 'final fax'. Interspersed with a re-telling of the final days of Scott polar expedition, the net result is very depressing, a tale that mines the dark places of the human spirit.<br /><br />\\"Orphans of the Helix\\" and \\"The End of Gravity\\" I found to be rather minor pieces, not on the same level as the other three stories, though still enjoyable reads.<br /><br />Simmons' style in all of these stories is probably quite a bit more literate than is common in science fiction, with layered themes and a mosaic feel of more being present than meets the obvious eye. This is strongly reinforced by Simmons' introduction to each of these stories, which often give some of their genesis and his thoughts on what he was trying to achieve in these works. But in this case, I think the introductions are somewhat superfluous, and in some cases actively detract from the ability to read these stories and see just what images and thoughts the stories evoke, unsullied by prior conceptions. I'd definitely recommend reading the stories first, and only reading the introductions afterwards if you feel the need.<br /><br />A strong collection, with three of the stories belonging in 'excellent' class, and a fine showcase for the diversity of ideas that Simmons brings to the field.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)robably quite a bit more literate than is common in science fiction, with layered themes and a mosaic feel of more being present than meets the obvious eye.

This book's setting is one that almost everyone has had at least some contact with, that of the circus and the high-flying trapeze act.<br />The period is the forties and fifties, a time when such relationships were never, ever talked about, criminalized in most states, and ruined many careers and lives if they became public knowledge.  To this setting Bradley brings a remarkably apt pen, one that shows the circus in such detail that you can literally hear the elephants trumpet, the lions roar, the drum roll before the death-defying flight of the trapeze artist. The book follows the happening of the Flying Santellis, a family that has given their all to the perfection of the trapeze act since the 1890s. The Santellis are a close-knit family, held together by tradition, discipline, and a set of old-world values. To this family comes young Tommy Zane, entranced by the dream of becoming a flyer, and so familiar with world of the circus as the son of a lion tamer that the lives of non-circus people seem almost unreal to him. He is brought under the wing of Mario Santelli for training, and there is a quickly developing attraction between the two, an attraction that is far more than just physical, an attuning of each to the other that leads to their perfect sense of timing with each other on the trapeze.<br />It is this point that Bradley develops so well in this novel, the impossibility of separating a person's sexuality from the rest of their lives, that love is far more than just sex. Add to that the environment of that time, when such love could not be freely expressed, and you have the recipe for serious emotional repression and destructive anger. Bradley's characters' feelings and thoughts bristle with such charge that it is impossible not to become caught up in their plight, not to have your own anger raised at the stupidity and prejudice displayed by Angelo, Mario's uncle, and others. The rest of the Santelli family have their own problems, too, somewhat more conventional, but just as heart-breaking, just as real as the family next door.  The book's ending is a true emotional uplift, growing out of and very true to Bradley's characters' development into mature individuals.<br />Bradley's sexual descriptions are only very mildly graphic, but there is some violence depicted here that might disturb some readers. But that is part of the point: it should disturb, that a society's rules, when at odds with basic human nature, can lead to such outbreaks of violence, detrimental to both the involved individuals and the society at large.<br />An impeccably detailed setting, sharply realized characters that live and breathe, an explosive situation, and a thematic message that is handled with grace and much insight - this is a novel that demands reading, regardless of your own sexual preferences.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)ur own anger raised at the stupidity and prejudice displayed by Angelo, Mario's uncle, and others.

This book attempts it, and in many ways succeeds in its aims.<br />Before we get to the lifeboat, Yann carefully develops not only his character of Pi but also shows some excellent slices of life in India, quickly throws both some heavy barbs and some praise for certain aspects of three of the world's major religions, and educates the reader in some basic rules on the care, treatment, and normal behavior of zoo animals. When the ship Pi is travelling on founders, taking down with it his parents and quite a few of the animals from the zoo that Pi's father was director of, Pi suddenly finds himself trapped on a lifeboat with the oddly (but logically) named tiger Richard Parker, and all of this earlier background material comes into play, making the situation not only highly believable but quite fascinating. Pi's resourcefulness in staying alive in this situation for 270 days is exceptional, and Richard Parker becomes a full-bodied character, while remaining very much a real tiger. The interaction between the two and the challenges of the sea is a broad canvas that Yann uses to investigate his larger questions of religion and life, questions which are answered on a very individualistic basis for Pi. But I think most people could recognize some points of contact with Pi's ruminations, and find their own lives richer for vicariously living through Pi's experience.<br />Yann's style is very fluid, occasionally almost poetic, and he gets by with a minimum of description of places and scenes. The style and the carefully placed informational material did much to make me believe in the basic situation of boy and tiger surviving together. The detail work is impressive, from Pi's raft construction to cleaning out the lifeboat of Richard's wastes - details which enforce the feeling that this is a description of reality. However, there were a couple of places where I felt that Yann included some items merely for their shock value, and weren't really necessary to develop his theme or story, and a couple of other happenings did not strike me as at all believable.  But neither does he unnecessarily drag out the survival story, and his wrapping of Pi's narrative in a surrounding story of a writer investigating the details of this tale from a much later date adds both cohesiveness and veracity to the story.<br />I was disappointed by the end of the book, as it brings into play the literary artifice of the `unreliable narrator', calling into question the entire earlier portion of the book. While this certainly led me to evaluate all the philosophical points Yann had raised, it left me with a large emotional let-down, an unhappiness with the overall gestalt of the book. I think I would have been happier if this final section had not been included, though many seem to think that it is this section that completes the thematic message of the book.<br />Still, a fascinating read about a truly exceptional situation, with more than enough message to occupy my brain, and enough visceral happenings to keep me emotionally engaged throughout the book.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat), there were a couple of places where I felt that Yann included some items merely for their shock value, and weren't really necessary to develop his theme or story, and a couple of other happenings did not strike me as at all believable.

This book is a marvelous re-working of the old Mother Goose rhymes, updated to today's scientifically oriented world.<br /><br />I first read this book just after it was published, when I was about eleven years old, and was immediately captivated. It made no difference that I didn't understand some of the terms being used.  The thing that caught me was the skill with which these modern-day and science-fictional items were folded into those well known rhymes, how well they fit and gave new, quite twisted, and in many cases hysterically funny meaning to them. Reading them today, these verses are still just as funny, if not more so than I found them to be in my youth, as I now can catch the fact that Winsor buried many sly references to Greek literature, outmoded scientific theories, and even satire about academic politics within their brief lines. My favorite along this latter line is `The Theory that Jack Built', which contains a fatal flaw, hidden by mummery, obfuscation, and bells and whistles, which all gets blown away when the Space Child presses the `Go' button.<br /><br />The illustrations are just as marvelous, and do much to help someone who might not completely understand the scientific terms to see just what is being referenced, while being very individualistic in style and maintaining the humorous tone of the whole book. Along with these visual aids, there are often `definitions' at the bottom of the page, some even more abstruse than the item being defined, but just as funny.<br /><br />Don't forget to read the `Answers' at the back of the book, which in addition to some appropriate real definitions, also provide some rather unique explanations of some of the terms used in this book, including one which takes a viscous dig at Congress.<br /><br />Give this one to your son or daughter, but not till you've read it yourself.

And just a little bit into the future, there may be a new theme park, one that draws on the images and ideas of fabulists such as Robert Heinlein, Barry Hughart, and yes, even the Beatles of Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields to create its attractions. For anyone with a smidgen of liking for the fantastic, for things which are a little bit beyond the current world, such a theme park might just be heaven.<br />For Mike, a twelve year old who has had to face cares and responsibilities that would try the best efforts of most adults, Dreamworld is more than a temporary haven. It's a place where he can live, sheltered from the world, and even hidden from park employees, helped by the other non-regulation denizen of this park, Annie, sometimes known as the Mother Elf. Ah, but there's something really strange happening in Dreamworld - at the end of the day shift, there are more employees leaving the park than arrived in the morning. And the arch-nemesis of this park, Alonzo Haines, proprietor of the competing park Thrillworld, would dearly love to find out who these `extras' are, as a lever to destroy Dreamworld. The battle to save the park is joined, and Mike and Annie find themselves in a fight to save not just their adopted home, but perhaps the entire universe.<br />Clearly, this is a fun book, written very much in the mold of some of Heinlein's juveniles, and echoes of The Mother Thing and the older Hazel Meade are clearly present in the character of Annie, while Mike evokes something of Kip and Thorby. Those who don't recognize those names will not be lost, as they are fully realized, engaging personalities, while for those who do these items provide a greater ambience and they will be treated to a great trip down memory lane. This is true also of the many references within this book to other authors and books - all of them are deserving of a read, but if you haven't read them, it won't detract from your enjoyment of this novel.<br />This being a Spider and not a Heinlein novel, there is a fair amount of Spider's specialty present, his penchant for puns and ironic humor, as evidenced most by some of the chapter titles like Out of Kin Troll. This adds a different flavor to this book, and those who like Spider's Callahan's Bar series will not be disappointed here.

No less so here, as Lewis takes the tale of Cupid and Psyche and adds a small change to the basic tale - but that change reverberates and focuses the message that Lewis is imposing on the tale, a message about what love is versus what many normally think it is.<br />Lewis sets the tale in the `barbarian' country of Glom, with a King obsessed with getting a son, and thereby cursed with three daughters. Orual is the supremely ugly one, Psyche just as beautiful as Orual is ugly, and the third sister is the personification of greed and petty jealousy. But it is Orual that the book follows, down deep into her basic outlook about herself, her relationship with the Gods, and most especially how her feelings for Psyche and her sense of propriety cause her to commit blackmail in the name of love. Lewis clearly shows that love that does not place the desires of the loved one above any personal sense of right/wrong/duty/honor is not a true love, but rather the product of selfishness, of the `I know what's best for my love' syndrome.<br />But this is merely the beginning to the layers of philosophy present in this book, as it calls into question not only if there are gods, but just how mortals can or must perceive them if they exist, and how much `God' is present in everyone. Masks are a symbol here, from the veil that Orual takes to wearing, to those masks used by the priesthood when performing their embassies for their god, to the masks that everyone presents to the outside world. Also covered is the value of good deeds versus an irredeemable sin, what vital tasks man is burdened with during his short lifetime, and even the value of philosophy as a field of study.  All this and more is hidden underneath this apparently simple story, with little direct exposition of these ideas until this last portion of the book, which is written as a dream allegory.<br />The characterization of Orual is excellent - she is person you can recognize and feel with, and her dilemmas are ones we all have faced, though perhaps not in such grandiose terms. Psyche, the King, and Fox, the sister's Greek slave teacher, are drawn with enough depth to understand their motivations, and provide the proper environment so that each person's actions are understandable and the plot action inevitable.<br />I did feel that the last section of book went a little too far in the way of symbolism and philosophy, that perhaps a more action-oriented explication of the points Lewis was trying to present in this section would have been better.

For the record, this was written by Ridley Pearson, not Stephen King, though King was certainly aware of its gestation.<br />But who wrote it matters little versus the prime requisite: is it readable? Does it provoke the spine-tingling feeling that some of the best in this genre can?<br />It's certainly readable. The characterization of the main character Ellen Rimbauer is truly excellent. She starts as a woman who is a rather naive nineteen year old, and progressing through her thoughts and feelings about marrying a man twenty years her senior with a reputation as a 'ladies man'.  How she manages her husband and his wayward ways forms one of the continuing lynch-pins of this tale. As she matures, she also starts to feel some attraction to those of her own sex, the depiction of which I felt was well done for a lady of Victorian sensibilities. But later, we are given a portrait of a woman who is slowly losing her grip on reality (or as an alternative explanation, the world she inhabits becomes truly strange). The house she lives in, and eventually becomes almost a prisoner of, Rose Red, is really the other main character, as it grows from the greatest mansion in Seattle to a house known for disappearances, murders, and suicides. On the basis of character alone, this is a worthwhile read.<br />But on the other aspect, the paranormal land of ghosts, inexplicable fears and visions, and houses with desires of their own, this book doesn't succeed as well. Perhaps I found the parallels with a real house of mystery, the Winchester Mystery House located in San Jose, CA, (and at which my son is a tour guide) to be just a little too strong. It too had a magnate husband and a lady mistress who, especially in her later years, believed that she would live forever if only she would keep building on the house, leading to some very strange architectural features of stairways leading directly into ceilings and doors that open to a three-story drop.  Within this book, the appearance of ghostly visions, the voices at a seance, the concept of the house being possessed by the ghosts of Indians who were buried on the site of this house, never seemed to quite gel with me, never produced the frisson  that I was hoping for.  I think, perhaps, that I found these elements to be a little too standard, with little originality to them.<br />The literary device of enfolding this whole story within a supposed doctoral dissertation and university investigation was a nice touch, but added little to it as a story, and it would have read just as well without it.<br />Still, a quite entertaining read, with an excellent look inside the mind of someone who changes from a very normal woman to something very strange, and making her journey to this mindscape very believable in terms of her own thought-processes and beliefs.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)ing on the house, leading to some very strange architectural features of stairways leading directly into ceilings and doors that open to a three-story drop.

This is a fairy tale built for the Orient - or more precisely, a fairy tale with an Oriental flavor written for the enjoyment of poor, deprived Occidentals who have never had the benefit of hearing some of these Chinese legends. Starting with Number Ten Ox (whose name is appropriately descriptive) and his village of Ku-fu, we are dropped into a China of ancient history. The village children, stricken with a strange malady that leaves them comatose and rigid, force Number Ten Ox to seek a scholar to unravel the mystery of their affliction. What he ends up contracting for is ancient Master Li Kao, who has a 'slight flaw in his character', which is all Ox can afford. Master Li determines that the only thing to save the children is the Great Root of Power, and Li and Ox proceed directly to attempt to obtain this Great Root. Thus begins an extraordinary set of tales that leads from the Imperial Palace to brothels to an enchanted destroyed city.<br />Along the way we meet quite a cast of characters: Ma the Grub, Henpecked Ho, the gross (in multiple ways) Ancestress, the greedy Duke of Ch'in, Doctor Death, and the jade-loving Lotus Cloud. Each is unique, though often specifically drawn as semi-caricatures; each adds their bit to this tapestry that includes the secret of immortality, the link between Heaven and Earth, invisible monsters, maze-filled dungeons that guard incredible treasure, where one's heart should be carefully hidden away.<br />Some of the tales herein are real Chinese legends, some are products of Hughart's own fertile imagination, but all are told with a large dollop of humor sketched in broad strokes and a not-so-obvious underlying morality that is quite relevant to every reader. The style may bother some people, as it is written to deliberately evoke that sense of 'Chinese' that many Americans have as a background image of that land and people, but I felt it was an excellent method of evoking that sense of 'different' and 'fairy' at the same time.  A few of the tales fell a little flat with me, and at times I thought that Hughart went a little too 'over-the-top' with his outrageous situations and characters, but the overall level of writing kept me nicely adsorbed and grinning quite a bit.<br />There is an overlying mystery, a puzzle to be solved, that connects all these tales, and leads to the final resolution of the story. In the course of working our way through these stories, there seems to be a large amount of coincidence in play, a definite sense of deux-ex-machina to each tale's resolution, but the end of the book proves that all these 'coincidences' are really part of a carefully thought-out overall plot design.<br />I figured out the puzzle quite a bit before the end, but that did not lessen the final emotional impact of the ending, which presents a gorgeous image, an image which is eminently fitting with the rest of the book, and made me wish for a few more tales from this land of not-quite-real ancient China.<br />---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)few of the tales fell a little flat with me, and at times I thought that Hughart went a little too 'over-the-top' with his outrageous situations and characters, but the overall level of writing kept me nicely adsorbed and grinning quite a bit. <br />There is an overlying mystery, a puzzle to be solved, that connects all these tales, and leads to the final resolution of the story.

A world that you can easily get lost in for many hours of enjoyment, a world so complete that at times you find yourself feeling that it is more real than the one we inhabit.<br /><br />This book, the second entry in the Clingfire trilogy, is very much a book in the mold of previous books in the set, even though written by Ross instead of Bradley. Ross shows in this book that she has mastered not only Bradley's styles and methods of telling a story, but has found the 'feel' of this world, where she can make additions to it that fit. This book is set during the Hundred Kingdoms era, and deals specifically with how the Compact forbidding use of laran weapons that act at a distance was first formed. Varzil the Good is one of three main characters here, a man gifted with a very strong laran ability and a healthy dollop of common sense entwined with an idealistic dream. His friend and compatriot is Carolin Hastur, heir to the throne, who, while not as well gifted as Varzil, has the character traits needed to be a competent ruler. In opposition is Eduin, son of Rumail Deslucido, who was instrumental in destruction of two towers in the prior book, The Fall of Neskaya. Eduin has been inculcated from birth with his father's obsession with wiping out the Hastur line. The last major player is Rakhal, Carolin's brother, who is never really developed as a character, but is rather the mover of major events as seen from a distance, as he usurps Carolin's right to the throne and institutes some draconian measures in an attempt to stamp out all resistance to his rule.<br /><br />The stories of each of the three major characters are well developed. Varzil grows from laran neophyte to Keeper and his burgeoning love interest with a lady, who is one of Eduin's targets for elimination, is both believable and provides an emotional charge to the final tally of events. Carolin grows from boy to a sturdy man, one who knows and values friendships and finds himself bound by duty to those who swear allegiance to him. Eduin may be the most interesting character, a man conflicted between the desires of his father that are so strongly engrained that they may be impossible to eliminate, and his basic good nature, that yearns for the friendship that Varzil and Carolin so freely offer to him.<br /><br />Some of the underlying methods and processes of matrix technology are shown within this book, but more to the point, the true horror of some of the laran weapons is shown, the driving impetus behind Varzil's and Carolin's idea to ban such weapons and have the towers answer only to themselves, not subject to the commands and whims of the local ruling lord. This thematic point is one with high relevance in today's world with its talk of 'dirty bombs', biological weapons, and chemical pollution of essential drinking supplies. Unfortunately, I don't think the purveyors of such ideas and weapons are reading this book, or if they do, will not take its message to heart.<br /><br />A fine addition to the Darkover universe, a good adventure, another time spent within the spell of this incredibly imagined world.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)with a lady, who is one of Eduin's targets for elimination, is both believable and provides an emotional charge to the final tally of events.

Daniel Galouye could write, and write well, as he proved with the too little appreciated Dark Universe, considered a classic by those who have heard of it, so I figured this was worth picking up when I found it used. But very little of that ability shows up in this book. Instead we get a very standard 50's style SF work, with a nicely Earth-threatening menace and a small group of people who will, somehow, figure out a way to defeat it.<br />The menace is a mysterious group of Spheres along with their Fortress cities, apparently formed out of pure energy, that suddenly appeared all over the planet on September 25, 1977. These Spheres attack anything generating electricity, Select and hunt down certain humans for no explicable reason, and annually produce a veritable maelstrom of psychic effects in all of what's left of humanity, effects so strong that people are left dazed for weeks afterword. Our little group of humans is a small ragtag collection of individuals that is all that remains of U.S. military, which keeps trying standard military solutions, including exploding a nuclear bomb in the middle of one of the Sphere's cities, even though it is obvious that nothing in the standard arsenal has any real effect.<br />But Maddox, the leader of this group, discovers that the material the cities are made of responds to the desires and wills of a human, forming itself into whatever shape is desired. But there is a downside - the stuff responds just as well to sub-conscious desires.  So Maddox starts on trip to control his sub-conscious, to rid his mind of extraneous thoughts and impressions. And it is just here that the novel, a fairly well told adventure to this point, falls apart. Conscious control of the sub-conscious and the ability to selectively edit the mind's memories is something that has never been conclusively demonstrated, but Maddox achieves this in short order. As a side benefit, with all this 'extra' stuff deleted from his mind, he finds himself capable of great feats of mentation and is capable of controlling multiple simultaneous thought streams. I found this most unbelievable, even with the prodding of having your subconscious desires made immediately visible, and even less so when just about all the other members of his party manage to achieve the same state in relative short order.<br />The Sphere's actions are nicely alien: in other words, they don't make too much sense. But again I found it most improbable that the Spheres, who have had many years in which to perfect their control of their malleable energy, and who greatly outnumber the humans, could not maintain their control of the stuff when Maddox's group tries to use it for their own ends.<br />Galouye's characterization, up to the point of these new-found abilities, is quite good, and he manages to sneak in a believable romance amongst all the action. The dating of this book is not a problem, as none of the situation or solution depend on anything that is not nearly timeless. But it does, unfortunately, read like a stock pulp SF work, with little that is original, and with some highly unbelievable premises.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)f great feats of mentation and is capable of controlling multiple simultaneous thought streams.

This was, I believe, Brust's third book, and it certainly illustrates a great imagination. But, as is also common with young writers, sometimes the execution is not quite up to the task of illuminating the imagination.<br />One way of looking at this book is as a prologue to the Bible, before the nominal seven days of creation. Brust has created a Heaven, formed from the stuff of chaos, the flux, whose first member is Yahweh, and its second, Satan. As these two fight the flux they create more of the First Born: Michael, Leviathan, Belial, Raphael, a few others. Eventually things stabilize for while, until the advent of the Second Wave, where once more the denizens of Heaven must fight the corrosive effects of the flux, and out of this fight are born the archangels. A Third Wave produces the angels, and it is after this point that we pick up the story. Yahweh conceives an idea of creating a new place out of the flux that would be safe from any further attacks of the flux, but to create it, he would need the help of just about all the inhabitants of Heaven, some of whom would surely perish during the construction job.<br />Satan is tasked with ensuring that all angels perform their assigned tasks, but before the Plan is even close to being implemented, Satan finds himself questioning the rightness of forcing angels to perform work where they might be injured or killed, even though the net result would be an obvious good for all survivors. Thus is formed the first conflict in Heaven, and the story is how this plays out. Which of the characters are the good guys and which are not is not what you might expect, nor are these lines necessarily clear-cut, as there are some definite gray areas here. The front line characters of Satan and Yahweh are not even the major players, but are rather more manipulated by the actions of others. As may be obvious, approach this book with an open mind, as it performs major havoc on traditional views of Heaven and its inhabitants - some might even call it sacrilegious. But by the end of the story, the more traditional picture of Heaven may be seen - and how this world changes to that picture is a highly entertaining and thought-provoking story.<br />While this plot idea is great and truly carries the story, I found the characterization somewhat lacking. Especially in the early sections of the book, there is a large of amount of dialogue that basically conveys nothing in terms of either information or character, making me feel as if I was wading through a gray fog looking for a base from which to observe the story. None of the characters ever really crystallizes into something sharp, which is a pity as much of the moral ambiguity of the story plays around just what type of people these are.<br />Clearly this book was modeled on somewhat similar types of work by Roger Zelazny, and as archetypal re-telling of legend, this work succeeds very well. Its message is well placed, its prose up to the task, but the lack of strong, sharply defined characters keeps this book from rising to the top level.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)tional views of Heaven and its inhabitants - some might even call it sacrilegious.

Robert Heinlein's \\"Jerry Was a Man\\" and David Brin's Uplift series have approached this problem before: when does an 'enhanced' animal become human? And if he's human, does he have a soul? What moral imperatives apply to such a being? How should such a being be treated? With this book, we get a deep and different look into this as we follow Lovelock, a genetically enhanced and psychologically conditioned monkey as he performs his tasks as a 'witness', a being specifically engineered to record every waking moment and action of a person deemed so significant that their lives are worthy of such attention.<br />The object of Lovelock's attention is Carol Jeanne Cocciolone, premier gaiologist, who has decided to travel on the Ark to the nearest stars in search of a habitable planet. By his conditioning, Carol Jeanne is Lovelock's love, his obsession, his paragon of virtue, a person he will do anything to protect. Along with Carol Jeanne comes her husband and his parents and her own two children, though none of them truly have any of the skills that are needed by the Ark, as a perk to entice Carol Jeanne to come. Seeing these people through Lovelock's eyes is a quick eye opener: the mother-in-law as a status hungry moocher and lay-about and the father-in-law and husband as wimps who meekly go along with just about anything the mother-in-law wants. Not the best group of people to try and integrate into a society that is supposed to be full of some of the best and brightest Earth has to offer - but as quickly becomes obvious, quite a few of the other travelers on the Ark are just as bad in their own ways.<br />It is partially this quite dysfunctional setup that begins to set Lovelock off on his own journey of self-discovery, finding that he is not just a mute 'witness', but has thoughts and desires of his own - desires that eventually allow him to defeat some of the conditioning imposed on him, to remove Carol Jeanne from the pedestal she was placed on by his conditioning, and to take prohibited action to try and implement some of those desires.<br />Lovelock continues to grow as person throughout this book, slowly wrapping the reader inside his problems. And his problems are those that all humans face, questions of morality: should I keep silent or tell a white lie to avoid harming someone? Do my own desires outweigh the good of the community? Why must I obey those strictures imposed by my surrounding society? Can I commit murder to save myself? At the end, there is only one possible conclusion: Lovelock is as human as you or I, and should be awarded both the rights and responsibilities of that condition.<br />Characters other than Lovelock are also well drawn, though some of them are almost caricatures, but each is definitely an individual worthy of some attention. Less well imagined is the Ark itself. I had quite a problem with a design that required that functioning ecologies be totally ripped upped and moved, right down to the dirt, whenever the ship changed from spin-induced gravity to an acceleration induced one - this is poor design, and there are other possible constructions that would obviate this need. The computer system of the ship as described is also less than what it could be - even given the state of the art when this book was written, I cannot imagine any system that would still leave back-door passages into the administrative privileges. Finally, the idea that the Ark would be planned with multiple communities of 'like-minded' individuals doesn't seem very plausible to me.<br />But all of these problems are comparatively minor.

Patience, the 13 year old protagonist of this novel, is a nominal slave to the Heptarch, ruler of this far-future world that was colonized by humans thousands of years ago. She is also the seventh seventh seventh daughter of the first Starship Captain, and as such is the subject of a prophesy declaring her to be either the savior or destroyer of the world. In the end, she is more slave to the prophecy than to the Heptarch.<br />Trained from birth in the arts of ruling and courtly intrigue, Patience is an intriguing character, whose real voyage of self-discovery starts with the death of her father. For this world has many different types of denizens that are almost human, gaunts, dwelves, and geblins. As Patience travels the world in search of the Unwyrm, she is forced to meet and interact with each of these races, and finding that each has their own right to life, their own ways of living, even if each of these races seems to be an incomplete copy of humans, and all are subject to overriding desires and commands that originate with the Unwyrm, the true slave-master of the world.<br />Card's themes of free will and moral imperatives to help others are nicely brought forward through his characters' interaction with each other, though at a couple places where he directly explicates some of this philosophy in the discourse of the giant Will, in comes across as a little bit preachy. The world and its biology is a fascinating if somewhat disturbing look at just what life really is, from the perspective of the genes, which folds into and on top of his free will ideas as a built in imperative that none may escape.<br />Some may find the climatic scene highly disturbing, involving rape, murder, and mental coercion in a manner normally considered well outside the pale of normal human actions, but it fits well with both story and theme.  Card does not shirk from the implications of his prior story development, and a little reflection on this scene will convince you that this is truly the only way the problems could be resolved that was consistent with the theme Card is presenting, but I do feel that this scene makes this book highly inappropriate for younger readers.<br />But Card fell down a little bit in his conclusion, his continuation of the story after that climatic scene, as it comes across as almost sugar-sweet after all the grimness of the rest of the book, as it proposes an extremely optimistic viewpoint about basic human nature that just doesn't fit.  Also a little bit disappointing was the final disposition of the brother-sister gebling kings, as this did not seem to be quite in character for either of them.<br />Some truly original ideas, some decent characters, but in the end I felt the theme came to over-dominate the story, left me with less emotional involvement than was possible, became too much an intellectual probing.

Try to remember back to the days when computers were giant things located inside even larger buildings, when access to them was jealously guarded by a high priesthood of computer scientists, and the results you got from them, after many days of painstaking labor, was as likely to be absolute rubbish as it was to be useful answers. This was the way the world was when Vinge wrote this remarkably prescient novella, a story of a world dominated by computer access to information, commonly available to everyone, where virtual reality and your avatar are more 'real' than your physical body. In fact, the story was so far ahead of its time that several of the ideas presented in it became the blueprint for how to continue to develop the way computers work and how people interface with them.<br />It's a fairly good story in pure fictional terms, also. Vinge does not stint on developing his characters while letting us wander in his (at the time he wrote it) fairyland. The conflicts and problems his protagonist faces are very real problems, and Vinge's resolution of the story rings as true as his title.<br />The title is significant: in today's world when many wander the net known only by a self-chosen moniker, and jealously guard access to any information about their real selves, but have, never-the-less, a large amount of information held in many databases about their real selves (driver's license, social security number, credit reports), obtaining their 'true names' would be equivalent to forcing them to stand naked on a stage. It is this aspect of today's information dominated society that is the subject of several of the essays that accompany this story, many of which advocate methods for maintaining absolute secrecy of communications on the web. This is a large subject rife with many opinions pro and con, especially after the events of 9/11 and the Patriot Act.

Told through the eyes of the physician Sinuhe, this is a dramatic recounting of one of the most unsettled times of this nation, as Amenhotep IV, self styled as Akhenaton, attempts to throw out all the old gods (and their associated priesthoods) and install in their place his vision of a single god, Aton, a new version of the sun god Ra.<br />Sinuhe is a finely drawn character. We follow him from childhood through his initiation into the priesthood and physician's school, and his first infatuation with a 'noble' lady - a lady who strips him of all his wealth, even down to selling his foster parents' home, a rude introduction to the adult world for Sinuhe. Beggared, with a price on his head, he is forced to travel to other countries, Syria, Babylon, Crete, in fact most of the 'known' world of that time. From this position, Waltari presents a comprehensive portrait of the lives of both the rich and poor, noble and slave, the various cultures and religions that held sway at that time. Throughout these travels, he maintains a very positive engagement with the maturing Sinuhe, showing how the events of his life drive him towards a philosophical viewpoint that is partially in accord with Akhenaton's vision of a brotherhood of all mankind, a man prone to a certain amount of romanticism, but more and more leavened with a sense of hard practicality. When he finally returns to Egypt and becomes enmeshed in the political swirl of events surrounding the Pharaoh, it is as a significant player, with a viewpoint that enlightens both the promise of the Pharaoh's dream and the actions that others, from Horemheb to Nefertiti, feel are necessary to save the kingdom.<br />Waltari has adopted a style that consistently evokes the sense of living in that time, a little distanced from the directness of most modern novels, but where the sights, the scents, the people, the attitudes, the living style of that time leap out from the page. Along the way, he presents a tremendous amount of detail that, if presented in a standard history book, would be deadly dull - but here it is a very necessary part of the engrossing story. The level of medical arts displayed by Sinuhe may surprise some people, but just about every procedure described in this book is well documented as being in use at that time. Just as detailed are his descriptions of a society where social mobility was not just possible, but common - again defying the impression many have of an Egypt that was totally caste locked. Battle techniques and weapons, city architectures, sailing prowess, trading policies, clothing, even the Egyptian mummification procedures all are carefully presented, each piece both historically accurate and necessary to the story.<br />A fine novel of character, a careful representation of the historical period, and a quietly underplayed depiction of one of the early battles between monotheism and polytheism which provides more than enough material for careful rumination. Not many historical novels approach this one in terms of readability, engagement, or accuracy - a book that literally makes its chosen time and place become alive.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)udes, the living style of that time leap out from the page.

Told in three separate sections that were originally published as separate stories, it details a post-nuclear war society where (once more) the Catholic church has become the repository for what little learning there still is, complete with monk scribes happily copying by hand the few remaining books. But at least for the first section of the book, the scribes don't understand what they're copying. When they uncover some ancient relics of Saint Leibowitz (a twentieth century engineer who tried to stop the book burnings and other atrocities) they end up enshrining one of his grocery lists and venerate a common blue-print as rare and sacred. Later portions of the book detail the resurgence of science, fueled by the church's repositories of knowledge, but as becomes increasingly obvious as you go further in the book, there is still no change in mankind's basic human nature, and war enters the picture again (and again) - covering almost a two-thousand year span.<br /><br />There is a large amount of ironical humor suffused throughout this book, which makes its prime message that man is doomed to continuously repeat his mistakes, leavened only by the love of a distant God, much easier to take. In many ways this book is a hard look at both the ultimate value of religion and at basic human nature, couched alongside some heavy symbolism (the Wandering Jew makes multiple appearances) and some very sharp satire. The story itself is told with such emotional power that I found myself both plumbing the depths of despair and laughing uproariously, while the moral and ethical questions raised kept poking sharp daggers into my under-brain, just waiting for the chance to come to the fore of my consciousness and force me to re-live this book again and again.<br /><br />Within each section of the book, characterization is excellent, from the young initiate Francis in the first section to the Caesar-like Hannegan and Brother Taddeo of the middle section to Abbot Zerchi of the final section. But the very fact that it is told as three separate stories leads to a little disjointedness, as the characters you have come to know and love in one section disappear in the next and a whole new set make their appearance. The unifying force between these sections is obviously the church, the one constant across all the years, and this provides the foundation for not only the story, but a framework for all the philosophical questions to reverberate against. Questions of is man inherently evil, what role God should play in an individual's life and his surrounding society, when does pride become hubris, what constitutes sin and can an earthly representative of God truly provide forgiveness, why do good deeds so often seem to lead to bad consequences, and many more. Miller does not really provide any answers to these questions - nor should he, as these questions are really only answerable at the individual level, but his story provides some powerful illumination of these questions, and his ending does leave some room for possibly the most enduring of human emotions, hope.<br /><br />This book is what science fiction should be, a book that enlightens what the human condition is within a context of an all-too believable  future world, literate and profound without hammering the reader on the head. Winner of the 1961 Hugo award, it clearly out-classed all the other contenders for that year, and ranks as one of the best the field has to offer.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)e middle section to Abbot Zerchi of the final section.

Carey envisions a society that far from denigrating the business of sex-for-hire, instead details one that embraces it; where there are thirteen Houses as an established part of the society, each of which specializes in a different area of sexual gratification, and trains their candidates from a very early age in all the arts of love, entertainment, and impeccable personal service.<br />She places this inventiveness against an alternate history background of Europe, which seems to have as its major demarcation point from our own history the defeat of the Roman forces by a united force of Picts. Within this history, the field of countries and societies she paints is a very standard semi-fuedal middlle-ages level of technology and monarchies, complete with all the standard court intrigues associated with that era. This is probably the main point of failure of this book, as to present the intrigue, she parades a host of characters to the reader's eyes early in the book - far too many of them, with few early clues as to which of these characters are important and which are mere spear-carriers.  There is nothing new in this intrigue; it's still the age-old story of individuals grasping for the power of a crown by any means possible. What is new is her use of Phedre, a lady marked from birth as belonging to the House of Kushiel, which specializes in the S&M brand of sex, as a fantasy incarnation of Mata Hari, using her training and own sexual inclinations as the lever to pry important information about all the various plots from her clients.<br />Phedre, from whose viewpoint the story is told, is a well drawn character. Also competently drawn are those who are closest to her, Delaunay, her patron and owner; Alcuin, her male counterpart; Joscelin, her ascetic martial-arts trained protector; and Hyacinthe, her gypsy-like friend. Unfortunately, the rest of the characters are only sketchily drawn, leaving me with little insight into the motivations of those grasping for power. Melisande, as the chief web-master of all the convoluted plotting, cries out for a far deeper characterization than what is shown, and if she had been so drawn, I think this would have been a much better book.<br />The true fantasy elements of this book are few and don't really play a part in the story until almost 700 pages in; those looking for elves, dragons, and goblins need not bother with this book. Those looking for some titillation may also be disappointed, as Carey's description of Phedre's various sexual encounters are only mildly graphic and have far more emphasis on the use of pain than many people may be comfortable with.<br />I found the prose style to be somewhat artificial, an attempt perhaps to re-create the lushness and verbosity of some eighteenth-century romances. It is this style, more than anything else, which leads to the 900 page length of this book. Far too often, Phedre would state \\"I don't really remember what else happened that night\\" and then proceed to give three paragraphs of description of those happenings. A more direct style would have probably reduced it to 600 pages, made it easier to follow, and held my interest better.<br />An interesting idea, a personable main character that I could empathize with, but a story and setting that are just too commonplace, told with too many words to make this a gripping read.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)the motivations of those grasping for power.

US	51152905	R3DF3EV81OONEY	0898651913	26488394	The Colors of Space	Books	2	13	15	N	N	Color it Bland	This was Bradley's third published book, originally published in slightly abridged format in 1963, later re-issued in 1983 in its complete form. Readers picking up the later release may be surprised by the relative unsophistication of this book compared to other works she was writing in eighties.<br />Technically, this is a semi-juvenile, with a protagonist, Bart Steele, who has just graduated from the Space Academy, ready to return to his Vegan home, where his father manages a fleet of inter-planetary space ships. Interstellar travel is the sole province of the alien Lhari, and humans can only ride as passengers in cold sleep in their vessels, supposedly due to the inability of the human body to withstand the stresses of hyperspace travel. The Lhari have formed a simple relationship with the Mentorians, humans who have had a slight genetic shift that allows them to withstand very high light illumination levels. The Lhari, who are also color blind, normally prefer these high light levels, matching their home world's level of illumination.  Bart, who is half Mentorian, can also see farther into the optical spectrum than normal, allowing him to see an eighth `color'. This provides the basis for the book's title, and plays a role in the final plot resolution. The Mentorians provide translation, color interpretation, and other services for the Lhari, setting them somewhat apart from the rest of humanity, who look upon them with some suspiscion.<br />The story revolves around Bart being co-opted to find the secret of the Lhari warp-drive fueling material by surgically changing his appearance so he could pass as a Lhari and having him ship out as a crew member on a Lhari ship that is home world bound. During the trip, he naturally finds that many of his Lhari crewmates are neither ogres nor saints, and comes to question the moral rightness of `stealing' this secret. The story is told as a very straight line progression, without any real surprises, and is therefore quite predictable in terms of final outcome, both in external society sense and in terms of Bart's development. Thematically, this book restricts itself to `different is not necessarily bad' and `the end does not justify the means', providing little in the way of fresh insight.<br />In general, a pretty standard space-opera plot typical of the late fifties and early sixties in science fiction, good for some mild entertainment, but also clearly showing that Bradley had not yet found her unique and powerful voice.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)predictable in terms of final outcome, both in external society sense and in terms of Bart's development.

These elements scream Hollywood blockbuster movie, but what we have here is a book. A book that is bogged down by way too much technical detail on hot cars, weaponry of all types (of which some of the details are incorrect), accident reconstruction techniques, sniper skills, and tales of many accidents that are not relevant to the main story. When Simmons is describing the actual action, the story reads well, but elsewhere it's as if all the research he did for this book was transcribed verbatim from his index cards.<br />Darwin Minor could be a very interesting character. But my belief in him was strained mightily by his incredible collection of talents: a doctorate in physics, college grad at 19, top-of-the-line Marine sniper, chess master, race car driver, premier accident investigator. The incidents Simmons uses to illustrate that last talent irritated me because in just about every case, Darwin comes up with the solution almost instantaneously, from extremely tiny clues, with none of Darwin's internal thought processes described, and with little of the actual required leg-work shown. The rest of the characters other than Darwin's love interest Syd are almost total ciphers, most especially the Russian 'bad guys', who start and remain nothing more than names, with no insight into their motivations and character, which brings into question the entire premise behind the final showdown.<br />This book would probably have been an exciting read at two hundred pages.

He starts from the assumption that what we see in our mirrors is not just reflected light beams, but rather are real beings that inhabit more dimensions than humans are accustomed to, and have been trapped into faithfully showing an image of this world as a result of losing a long ago war with men. Never mind what violence this concept does to the laws of physics - science is a tool that China uses and discards according to the needs of his story.<br />As our world has gotten more industrialized and the use of mirrors and other reflective surfaces has grown, these beings are more and more tied down to this imprisonment. Ah, but here Mieville throws another curve - what of those beings who don't have reflections? Vampires have been with us in legend and folk tale for a long time, and under Mieville hands they are transformed into advance scouts, spies on our world, for these denizens, whom Mieville calls 'imagos', finding ways to break their prison.<br />Now to top off this already fantastic idea, China describes what happens to our world when these imagos finally do break free of their prison. The resulting bleakness of a war ravaged world fits the Mieville mold perfectly (no sunshine pollyanna stories for him!), as we follow the attempts by one man, Sholl, to communicate with what is left of humanity and get closer to these beings.  This individual may be a unique human - no vampire will touch him, except for one, his analogue in the mirror world. And with this juxtaposition of opposites Mieville imbues this story with multiple levels of meaning, a labyrinth of mirrors, opposites, reflections and non-reflections, philosophies and points of contact with our world. All told in China's inimitable style, where he shows his great command of the English language to describe, to illuminate, to evoke mood and feeling, though in this work it is not quite so overpowering as it has been in his previous novels. The ending is quite fitting, and not a very predictable one at all, providing yet another layer of thought and meaning to a story already richly imbued with this.<br />Perhaps there could have been a little deeper look at the inner thoughts and society of the imagos, and a little more background to his protagonist, but as it sits this is a small, polished gem, waiting for the unwary reader to get lost inside its multiple (self-reflecting) facets.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)great command of the English language to describe, to illuminate, to evoke mood and feeling, though in this work it is not quite so overpowering as it has been in his previous novels.

This book follows directly after Athyra (though it is not really necessary to have read that book before trying this one), a book which introduced the character of Savn, a Teckla lad who manages to save Vlad's life. This book is about how Vlad tries to repay that action. Savn was left with a severe case of 'battle fatigue' at the end of the prior book, and Vlad finds a healer who might be able to help Savn, but the healer is facing eviction as her property is involved in a holding company bankruptcy. Vlad and Kiera the Thief, in tracing back the financial paperwork, come across an apparent murder of a very high-flying scam artist who has built a financial pyramid that is threatening to come apart like the proverbial house of cards, and in the process possibly leading the Empire into civil war and anarchy.<br />The plot is convoluted and involves much of the House of Orca as the financial dealers of the Empire, with heavy involvement by the Jhereg and the Phoenix Guards, but there is little real action. Instead, we are treated to a rather tortured discourse on why moral compromise is sometimes necessary to preserve free trade, and a lesson in economics that might have been lifted right from an Economics 101 textbook.  On the brighter side, this book sees a return to first person narration, by both Kiera and Vlad, as opposed to the third person voice of Athyra that so marred that book. Along with this first person style comes also  Brust's typical ironic bursts of humor and sly satirical digs. Cawti, Vlad's estranged wife, is seen by indirection here, in letters from Kiera to her, and some of what she is feeling about her hunted husband comes through, and showing a  possible indication of where this series might be headed in the future.<br />There is revelation in the last ten pages of this book about the real identity of a certain personage, that will obviously be necessary to know about before reading later books in this set, but I thought this revelation was not really set up properly. There just weren't enough clues planted earlier to where this revelation didn't come as a shock, and at least at first I had real difficulties believing it.

Unlike all the previous books in this series, this one is not told from Vlad's viewpoint, but rather instead is done in third person and mainly from the viewpoint of Savn, a young (70+ year old) Teckla lad. Savn, apprenticed to the local physicker, gets caught up into Vlad's orbit by a chance meeting on the road, and is soon called upon to determine the cause of death of a traveling distributor that Vlad knows. This section is interesting, showing how much can be learned about such things merely by close observation and careful thinking, somewhat in the mode of Sherlock Holmes. But it also points up a major failing of Brust's imagined world - although the various denizens of this world (except for the Easteners like Vlad) live for a very long time, I found it very hard to believe that someone who has already lived for 70 years would display the level of naivete and ignorance of basic human interactions displayed by Savn.<br />Savn later gets a chance to use his medical skills to save the life of Vlad - and once more there are some interesting points brought forward about how knowledge is accumulated in this world. Use the scientific method? That might be difficult in a world where sorcery, witchcraft, telepathy, and walking undead are real - how can you believe your results? An older method is assumed here - if a particular procedure works once, that result is passed down by word of mouth from generation to generation, although it is quite possible that the method may have extra steps that have no relevance to its actual success.<br />Beyond these interesting side-lights, the story itself is a pretty straight-forward tale of Vlad planning and executing a revenge against the local undead sorcerer lord. But since we don't get to see inside Vlad's head, the picture of the action is fuzzy, and worse yet, lacking in the humor that suffuses the earlier books in this series, most especially the ironic back-and-forth between Vald and his jhereg familiar Loiosh. Instead we get some looks inside the thought processes of Loiosh's mate Rocza.  As she is basically a wild jhereg, not familiar with the ways of man, this view of the happenings is also fuzzy.  We do get to see, to a degree, just how Vlad appears to the average person of this world, but it is not a very illuminating view.<br />Thus, other than some interesting background material about this world and its ways, I found none of the things that made the earlier books an engrossing and entertaining read.  As this story is not important to later books, other than the introduction of Savn, who plays a minor role in the next book, Orca, this one can safely be skipped.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)action is fuzzy, and worse yet, lacking in the humor that suffuses the earlier books in this series, most especially the ironic back-and-forth between Vald and his jhereg familiar Loiosh.

But he himself is not quite happy, nagged by the feeling that this method of producing a utopia is not the best, and some memories he has of his part in the WWIII conflict.  That conflict was one of two giant computers out to dominate the world, and eventually resulted in a rebellion by the people, a rebellion fueled by a certain notebook that Dr. Martine left lying around when he exited the normal world in favor of his island hideaway. Eventually Martine's doubts lead him to return to the outer world to see what has happened, only to find his old notebook has become the new bible, and people in following its maxims are deliberately having their limbs amputated and replaced by miracles of cybernetic prosthesis, as their method of proving the dominance of mind over machine. This portrayed society is fascinating both for its startling differences and its commonalties with our own.<br />The book obviously has a heavy philosophical component, as we follow the Doctor's thoughts and excerpts from his notebooks. But there is also a strong humorous undercurrent, with multiple (rather atrocious) puns (are puns ever anything else?), and a lot of laughing at itself for being so self-important. There is also a trend to treat sex as one of the most important actions of the human animal (one scene runs to a couple of pages as a single sentence), an item that inevitably gets folded into the philosophical discourse.  The general prose style is quite readable, not overly descriptive and with reasonable dialogue, but it probably wouldn't win any style contests. Characterization is almost totally that of Martine, other characters have little development other than as foils for his development of a new philosophy - which naturally he records in another notebook.<br />There is much food for thought here, while Wolfe maintains a very interesting and dramatic story line, and keeps the whole thing all too believable. Is it the best thing ever written? No, but it is more than deserving of a contemplative read, and the thoughts and ideas presented will make you do a little thinking about just where our computerized world of today is headed.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)ts folded into the philosophical discourse.

Why can't everyone accept the differences and treat everyone with respect? Why do people always assume the worst about other people? And what would the world be like if everyone were the same?<br />For Meg Murry, these questions have critical import. As an adolescent who is always getting in trouble at school, both academically and behaviorally, she finds the ease with which her twin brothers manage to fit into society almost criminal, and her four-year old genius brother Charles just as impossible for not trying to correct the general impression of him as being a dolt. Worse, the gossip about her father, who has been missing for almost a year, makes her fly into a rage, as he is the person she looks to as able to fix all wrongs.<br />It is from this position that we start this wild adventure, a trip that will take Meg and Charles to several planets and multiple dimensions in search of their father, and will involve them in a fight with a truly evil entity, an entity that insists that the universe will run much better if only every intelligent being will think and act the same. Shepherded by Mrs. Which, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Whatsit, who provide the means of travel and some important advice, the trip is a voyage of self-discovery, of learning the whys and wherefores of the world, of what is possible and impossible.<br />The themes L'Engle tackles in this book are as old as man: just what are good and evil, self-determination versus authoritarian dictates, what higher powers exist and what role do they play in shaping one's life, when should one bend to the dictates of custom and society and when should such be ignored, when must one depend on one's own abilities and not look for help from others. These themes are not baldly presented, but grow out of the story and her characters, and younger readers probably will not be too aware of them. At the same time, there is a certain amount of cuteness to the story and characters, which adults may find a little annoying, but is certainly appropriate to the intended reader age.<br />The conclusion of this book felt a little rushed, and the method of victory seemed far too simple, given the depth of theme that is buried in these pages. Perhaps that can be forgiven in a book that has several sequels, where these rough edges can be smoothed out. As an inventive, engaging book for young readers, this book is a winner, and still can be enjoyed by the adult reader.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)hich adults may find a little annoying, but is certainly appropriate to the intended reader age. <br />The conclusion of this book felt a little rushed, and the method of victory seemed far too simple, given the depth of theme that is buried in these pages.

As a starting point, it greatly helps if you have a power plant that can deliver effectively unlimited power, the invention of Jubal, Travis Broussard's highly eccentric cousin. Travis, as an alcoholic cashiered astronaut, provides both some of the necessary capital and the experience level to make such a project a possible reality. For labor, four `kids' (they're 20+ years old) who are motivated and highly intelligent, who already have some skill sets that are quite relevant to the task are quite willing to learn more.  Building the ship occupies a good two thirds of the book, and some of the details of how it's done in a hurry-up, make it work (while really testing for safety) fashion make for fascinating reading. The actual flight of the Red Thunder, while still interesting, is not quite so fascinating, and the space rescue that the crew performs on an American attempt to reach Mars smacks a little bit of melodrama, but it had me turning pages till two in the morning.<br />The power plant device, the `Squeezer', is highly improbable, and violates quite a few principles of physics (as known today), but it is the basic element that both allows the space ship to become a reality, and due to its inherent power, drives the reasoning behind building the ship as a private enterprise, as such power, in the wrong hands, could become a nightmare. This helps drive one of the thematic messages of this book, an almost paranoid anti-government (of any stripe) stance, a reflection on the reality that all humans are not inherently good, kind, or peaceful. Offsetting this message are some others: people really can and often do help one another, people do better when they have a definite goal to work towards, your family is a major influence in your formation, but is not the only or final determiner of just what type of person you become.<br />Varley pays some definite homage to Heinlein here, with a plot line that is very much a re-working of Heinlein's Rocket Ship Galileo (Heinlein's first and probably his weakest juvenile), updated to today's world (and so becoming far more believable). There are more references to Heinlein in the character's names (Manny Garcia, Jubal) and John D. MacDonald (Travis, McGee and the Florida setting). This book is not technically a juvenile, but it has that same feel, and is readable by almost anyone over the age of fourteen or so (there are some references to sex and some portrayed family relationships that are probably not appropriate for younger readers).<br />The characters are well fleshed out, and the portrayed interpersonal relationships ring with veracity.

This book does not fall into that trap, being something of a mix of memoir, short vignettes of many, many people, both famous and ordinary, and the more normal recounting of the happenings of history.  Often the people stories are insightful, sometimes humorous, and do much to help illustrate Knightley's main thesis of just what an Australian really is.<br />The downside of this method of narration is that it is easy to lose objectivity, something I'm afraid Knightley is guilty of in at least a few places. His political bias is very much in evidence throughout this book, most glaringly in his depiction of the various Prime Ministers and the battles between the working man and the rich landholders/business executives.  At the same time, his depiction of the items that have gone into the making of the essential Australian character is well told, forming a mosaic of events and people that put this character into clear focus. Having lived in Australia myself (a very long time ago, but I don't think there has been any basic change in this item since), I can testify that the traits of wishing everyone to `have a fair go' and mateship really do seem to be defining items of that character.<br />One item that would definitely have improved this book would have been the inclusion of some maps of the country. Unless one is intimately aware of the geography of this continent-country, the references to literally hundreds of place names and towns can be daunting without some way to place them spatially.  I would have also liked to see a little greater treatment of the early period of its settlement, as the emphasis of this book is very much the twentieth century, and even more so on the last half of that century. Often the narration is told from the strictly political point of view, with little reference to the great resource finds and their development that had quite an influence on how Australia developed.<br />On the other hand, Knightley does a very good job of portraying and documenting the treatment that the Aborigines have been subjected to, from the earliest settlements to the latest landmark court decisions dealing with their land rights. More than any other item, this one area shows just how much Australia has changed from a blatantly racist and xenophobic nation to one that has at least begun to recognize its past failings and find its place in a truly multi-cultural world.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)nd their development that had quite an influence on how Australia developed. <br />On the other hand, Knightley does a very good job of portraying and documenting the treatment that the Aborigines have been subjected to, from the earliest settlements to the latest landmark court decisions dealing with their land rights.

US	51152905	RLH1FB6BM6SO	0380789175	154562288	The Crook Factory	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Real Spys Versus Real Men	Hemingway always liked to present an image of being a 'man's man', and the side of him that acutely observed and recorded those around him and their swirling tide-pool of emotions was normally hidden from view. Simmons, delving deep into the minutia of what is known about the man, managed to catch this ambivalence in this spy-vs-spy novel. Hemingway's braggart, macho face is clearly in evidence, but also much that is deeper: his genuine feelings for his children (and his 'children' were a much larger group than his biological family), his own realistic opinion of both his own and other's writing abilities, his fears and depressions, his charismatic presence, his dominance of almost any group he was part of, his real appreciation of what excellent art is, his total arrogance towards those whom he felt did not meet his standards.<br />Beyond this fine character portrait, we find a plot that seemingly came strictly from the land of make-believe, that is until you look at the documented facts surrounding the creation and operation of Hemingway's contribution to the WWII effort, his self-named Crook Factory. Nominally a strictly amateur counter-espionage group, which should have occupied the attention of the Washington bureaucrats for all of two minutes, is instead shown here to be the focus of not one but at least four professional intelligence-gathering organizations. Simmons weaves a finely complicated tale within the documented facts, some of which paint a very frightening picture of certain American organizations, and which become even more frightening in light of certain recently passed legislation allowing these organizations even more effectively unsupervised power.  In Simmons' hands the facts and the fiction meld to become a nice who-is-really-who thriller, a ball of twine that Simmons carefully unravels and knits into shapes that continue to intrigue till the very climax of this work.<br />Simmons' style is a long ways from Hemingway's, normally a pretty basic utilitarian prose that does a decent job of presenting the story, but not exceptional. In a few spots, however, he caught something of Hemingway's inimitable ability to describe far more than just what the objective words on the page relay. These moments are few, though, and in many places I felt he presented too much mind-boggling detail of marginal relevance to the main story, regardless of how well these details are documented. These details in many places somewhat spoil the pacing of this otherwise well-wrought thriller.<br />Simmons also includes an epilogue, just to tie up all the loose ends. As he says himself within it, this is a bad idea. He had a perfectly good finish without the epilogue, and its inclusion merely weakens the overall impact of the work.<br />A good, enthralling read, with some nasty implications for today's world, although perhaps not the absolute top-flight work Simmons has exhibited in such works as Hyperion.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)ic utilitarian prose that does a decent job of presenting the story, but not exceptional.

But what about the exceptional speller, the one who continues on to the real contests at regional, state, and national level? Is there something fundamentally different about such a person? Or, perhaps, is that person forced into a life of near slavery to the mastery of the idiosyncrasies of the English language by a parent or teacher who sees in the child a vision of their own immortality?<br />The first portion of this book begins the investigation of just such questions, as we follow Eliza Naumann through her first experience with the culture of the spelling bee, finding that she has a talent for this, though in all other subjects she is merely average. Her family had always considered her to be something of the dunce of the family, with a lawyer mother, a Hebrew scholar father, and an academically high-achieving brother.  Finally being good at something is a new experience for her, and the praise and attention she receives from her family is a major boost to her ego. As she travels along the bee contest route, from local to national, she starts to flower into the fully functional person she can be. The environment of the spelling bees is well captured: the gut wrenching tension, the idiosyncrasies of the other contestants waiting their turn, the appearance to the contestants of all the bee organizers/helpers, the sheer luck of the draw as each word is selected.<br />But once the story continues beyond the first national championship, it begins to take on an entirely different flavor, as Eliza's brother begins searching for an alternative religion, her mother is revealed as having kleptomaniac traits, and her father starts introducing her to the mysticism of Kabbalist Abraham Abulafia. As each person continues down their chosen paths, all of them become more and more entangled  in their own version of mysticism and self-hypnosis. The father is revealed as the spider at the heart of this lair of oddness, driving each of the family members in their own way towards the same end point. Here is where I think the novel fails, as this single subject takes over and dominates all things in its path. I found this neither believable in terms of its characters nor in terms of an objective means of finding either God or inner peace. The questions raised about the characteristics of champion spellers are basically dropped, replaced by this portrait of a totally dysfunctional family, a portrait seen many times before in other books.<br />Eliza's  final action at the end of this book is obviously predictable; so is the final status of the family.

The only trouble is, the military objective is inducing his new-found lady love Ekaterin to marry him. His plan includes notable pieces of strategy: not to be too obvious about it, as she is still in mourning for her late husband (see the earlier book Komarr for details); keep other suitors well away; make sure there are frequent opportunities for the two to be in each other's presence; ensure that she becomes aware of all the niceties that would entail from marrying into one of the noblest families on Barrayar.  Each piece of his plan, though, runs into one minefield after another, and as he puts emergency stop-losses in place, his situation continuously deteriorates, culminating in a dinner where absolutely everything goes wrong.<br />The dinner may be the high point of this book - the person who can read this section and not fall over laughing, cringing, and crying all at the same time isn't a real human being. For this book is not about military action, political plots, or single-handed world-saving, but is rather a very witty comedy. The picture of Miles making just about every mistake a lovelorn suitor can is both marvelously funny and very believable, and the picture of Barrayaran society is solidly fleshed out, making the whole a perfect environment in which to play out such a comedy of manners.  As usual, Bujold keeps several plot threads spinning at once, whose resolution, while (for once) not at all earth-shaking, makes for a nicely unified wholeness to the basic story.<br />In another departure for Bujold, this story is told from several viewpoints, not just Miles', which adds a lot to the reader's perspective of the society and situation, and also allows for much greater character development of Ivan Vorpatril, Mark (Miles' clone brother), and Ekaterin than has been the case with previous books in this series.<br />Perhaps my only real objection to this book was that some of the side plots from the main story just didn't seem to have enough importance and weren't detailed enough to make me really get involved with them, so that their major effect on the final outcome seemed to be larger than justified and a little bit of a surprise. This is a pretty minor quibble, though. Nominated for the 2000 Hugo award, this is a fine entertaining read, full of chuckles and belly-laughs, managing to make Miles into a normal human being without totally losing his aura of impossible competence, engaging and heart-warming.

Using only the known science of the day, it imagined a world so wildly different from our everyday experience that it dazzles the mind, showing just how wild the universe really can be.<br /><br />The world is Mesklin, a very large planet that rotates on its axis in just eighteen minutes, leading to gravitational forces of 700 gravities at the poles, and just 3 gees at the equator. But this is just the first of the items that make the world unique: its average temperature is a toasty  -160 degrees Celsius; a methane/ammonia atmospheric composition that at these temperatures act much like water on Earth - phasing between solid, liquid, and gaseous forms; a wildly ecliptic orbit and planetary axial tilt that has strange consequences for the weather. Now add an intelligent native life form that is fifteen inches long and just three inches tall, looking very much like an overgrown millipede with pinchers, an Earth probe stranded at one of the poles that Terran scientists would very much like to retrieve for the data it contains about high gravity environments, and you have the ingredients for a great scientific adventure story.<br /><br />Clement, a high school science teacher for much of his life,  writes very much in the mold of a much earlier SF writer, Jules Verne.  As such, the emphasis is on the science, the puzzles and oddities extreme conditions can present, rather than on character or thematic messages. Every detail of this world was very carefully worked out, right down to why the native inhabitants would 'see' their world as a hollow flattened bowl, complete with accurate maps, and would reject almost out of hand the idea that the surface they could see was really the outside of a sphere. In fact, a good bit of the charm of this book is the portrayed alien mind-set, showing just how much environment shapes the way people look at things. This also applies to the Earth scientists, who have great trouble at times seeing how the extreme conditions lead to important technological conclusions, such as why a canoe is not a viable shape for an ocean-going vessel at super-high gravities.<br /><br />The plot is pretty much a series of adventures occasioned by various scientific oddities as the Mesklinite party travels across the world from equator to pole in search of the Earthling's probe, with little in the way of character development or any deeper meanings. There is some severe dating of some of the technology used: slide rules, film recordings, environmental suit mechanical linkages, etc. There is one item here that was quite a bit ahead of its time - the use of a water bed as a method for staying in high-gee environments for extended periods of time (but was Clement aware of Heinlein's description of the water bed in Beyond This Horizon, written in 1941?). But the dating does not seriously detract from the main focus of the novel, which is Mesklin itself, just as timelessly incredible as the day this first saw print.  Recommended for those who enjoy the scientific puzzle, those who still see the universe as an incredibly varied, complex, and beautiful composition, where scientific fact really is much stranger than fiction.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)great trouble at times seeing how the extreme conditions lead to important technological conclusions, such as why a canoe is not a viable shape for an ocean-going vessel at super-high gravities.

The middle book of the last of three related trilogies must be even more difficult. Haven gotten through the Assassin and Liveship Trader sets (and if you haven't, you need to before tackling this set - you won't regret it), and Fool's Errand as a the first book of this set, this becomes an obvious bridge work between all that has gone before and (presumably) the tie-up of all the various plot threads in the last volume.<br />FitzChivalry Farseer is once more the star, opening this volume as a very much-wounded man, having lost his bond mate, and forced to once more try to fit in to the court intrigues by playing the servant to Lord Golden as Tom Badgerlock. New problems almost at once descend upon him, from his adopted son Hap's wayward ways to complications in his own love life, while the pressures of the Piebald group mount upon both Fitz and the kingdom, and Prince Dutiful's training in the Skill becomes an imperative, regardless of Fitz's own feelings of inadequacy in matters of the Skill. Add in problems with the Outisland delegation and Dutiful's promised bride, and the Bingtown traders requesting help in their war against Chalced, and there are more than enough plot threads for several novels.  But the focus of this book is not so much in unraveling all these threads, but rather in Fitz's development as a person, along with all the people around him. Throughout this book, we see Fitz make errors in judgement, fail as a parent, as a spy, a lover, a teacher, as a friend. Each error leads to further growth of the man as he tries desperately to fix all his self-imposed problems while also working to aid the kingdom in what he sees as the best way possible.  Lord Golden is exposed as having even more personas than previously known, each equally as enigmatic. Lord Chade comes into his own as a real human, with understandable desires and forgivable failings, and even Hap becomes a very recognizable young man with a very normal set of young man's problems.<br />This is therefore a quiet book, without a great deal of surface action, but with a great deal of character development, and the setting in place of all the things and characters needed for a final denouement. As the characters make up so much of the charm of this entire set of interrelated stories, it is a fully satisfying book, even though it has no real ending, and with possibly even more questions raised than answered within its various disclosures of tie-ins between the various plot threads.

All of his novels to date have this sense of being written at the bottom of a dank, odiferous, and pitch-black well, to where the tiny bits of color that he allows shine through like the sun after a cloudburst.<br />For this, his first work, he confines himself to the comparatively mundane setting of underground London, underground in both the physical and slang senses of the word, as we follow the story of Saul Garamond, heir apparent to the King Rat of Pied Piper fame. From the sewers to the rifling of garbage heaps for dinner, Mieville delights in offending your hygienic senses while enticing you with glimpses of a musical sub-culture that is just as strange to the average person as the rarified air of sub-atomic research. Bringing the characters of the ancient fairy tale to life is no small task, and Mieville succeeds admirably in the persons of King Rat and the Pied Piper himself. The Pied Piper comes across as a truly sadistic being, as shown by his actions, though at one point he specifically denies that characterization, while King Rat is easily identified with as the whining, downtrodden person who can never quite reach his goal of revenge.  Their conflict is very real and very understandable, couched in a thousand years of remembrances of wrongs done, and is an effective mirror of all too many human interactions.<br />What is not so well crafted is the character of Saul. His reactions to the impossibility of the reality of King Rat, or to the murder of his father, come across as much too accepting, reactions that no normal person would have. But it is even hard to judge just how close to normal Saul is, as his background, his emotional makeup, his normal life are only sketched in before being plunged into the midnight realm of rats and sewers.  The emotional impact of this book would have been greatly enhanced had Saul been given much more development prior to the start of the fairy-tale action.  The secondary characters are also given short shrift, and as these characters have important roles to play in the final outcome, this once again subtracts from the full power this story could have had.<br />For a first novel, this is excellent, already showing signs of Mieville's imposing command of the English language to evoke mood and feelings, but the necessary cohesiveness between story and character that would make this a great novel is lacking.  Still a very entertaining read, worth the time and effort, and very much recommended before tackling his later works of Perdido Street Station and The Scar, where he shows how much more he can accomplish.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)more development prior to the start of the fairy-tale action.

Butler is not only no exception, she is one of the standard setters, and this work is a prime example.<br />This is a story of Dana, a modern Afro-American writer married to a white writer, who is drawn back in time to live with Rufus, plantation and slave owner in the period of 1815 - 1830, and also her distant ancestor. Though the mechanism by which she is forced back in time is never rationally explicated, this is almost immaterial, and Dana (and the reader) must simply deal with the transfer as a fact. But she is always drawn back at those times when Rufus is in danger of losing his life, from a near drowning to a contemplated suicide. When she helps him out of sheer humanitarianism, it leads to her having a rather strange position within his household, neither wholly slave nor anything close to being the equal of the whites. From this position, she can observe all the interactions between owner and slave, and at least initially be somewhat shielded from the worst of the living conditions of the slaves.<br />That shielding will not last, as Butler develops a powerful theme of how unbridled power leads to abuses that crush lives and hope, and just as much imposes character changes in the wielder and the recipient of such power. As a stark portrait of living conditions in that time, as a diatribe that exposes just how much has been conveniently forgotten about slavery and its demeaning, demoralizing effects, this work will evoke emotions of shame, rage, and empathy with all who are, through no fault of their own, caught in situations with very limited choices.  This theme is just as much an indictment of male dominance as it is of slavery, just one more example of power wielded inappropriately.<br />The character of Dana is vividly portrayed, as she slowly changes from modern American to someone who accepts compromises of principal in the name of survival, till she is a person who can barely recognize who and what she was before these incidents. Rufus and his father are also very well delineated, and the personal interactions of Dana, Rufus, and several of the slaves drive much of the plot action. Somewhat less well shown is the character of Dana's husband, and his motivations and actions don't ever seem to gel into a full-bodied person, a pity as this could have been the third pole of her theme, the reaction of a modern, liberal white to these conditions.<br />Butler's prose is more than adequate to her task, often lean and starkly descriptive, but there are places where I felt she should have added additional detail, dwelt on some scenes in greater depth, in order to better bring out the true horror of the situation.<br />Butler does not have the recognition (or the sales numbers) of Toni Morrison, but with this book she shows that she belongs in the same company. Whether this book is read as obviously well researched historical fiction, as science fiction that meets the prime criteria of that field as a literature of ideas, or as a novel of character, it is prime fodder for thought, while engaging all of your emotions.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)who accepts compromises of principal in the name of survival, till she is a person who can barely recognize who and what she was before these incidents.

This book is a direct sequel to The Sparrow, and while there is some explanatory material about the events in The Sparrow in this book, I'm afraid someone who hasn't read the earlier book will feel a little lost, and will definitely not be able to appreciate the full power of this book.<br /><br />Once more I found myself irresistibly drawn to Ms. Russell's full-bodied characters. Emilio Sandoz, the Jesuit priest who has been through a myriad number of events that would test anyone's faith, in this book begins to find a way to believe that life is still worth living, that he can still be of benefit to the people around him. Sophia Mendez, the quiet, withdrawn, abused, and highly intellectual lady finds a reason to return to the faith of her parents when she finds herself marooned on Rakhat, surrounded by enslaved Runa. New characters of Giardano Bruno and his bodyguard Nico prove that Russell can portray many kinds of people in a very believable manner.<br /><br />Perhaps the reason these characters are so fascinating is that each of them has their own outlook on life, their own problems, their own ways of coping with life's vagaries. When placed within the Runa/ Jana'Ata society, each person's attempts to influence that society becomes magnified, each action leading to consequences both foreseen and totally unexpected. Which brings to the fore the focus of this book, which is much more about cross-cultural relations and impacts than religion, though the original questions of The Sparrow are not slighted here. Within the events that humans arrival on Rakhat have provoked, there is a deep delving into the ethics of the 'the end justifies the means', played on a canvas where a species survival is the end stake.<br /><br />There are some areas where I was not quite as pleased. The characterization of the aliens was just a little too human, even though such characterization does much to highlight the fact that the ethical problems of this book apply just as equally here on Earth. In some ways, the cultural parallels between the Jana'Ata and the American Indians were just a little too obvious. And once again, the story is not told in a totally linear fashion, with occasional flash-forwards to various later periods that then fill in the back-story of the history of the world after the main events of the book. While this type of structure worked very well in The Sparrow, here I thought it led to a little disjointedness to the story continuity and too much a lessening of suspense.  Once again, there are some aspects of the portrayed science here that do not ring true. These are all minor quibbles, not seriously hurting the engrossing wholeness, the feeling of not only that this is how it could be, but the why of seemingly random and sometimes-cruel events.<br /><br />There are very few works that approach these two books in terms of thematic depth and both intellectual and emotional reader involvement. Nominated for the 1999 Hugo Award, this book fully deserved that honor.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)the fact that the ethical problems of this book apply just as equally here on Earth.

Ah, the space opera of old, with ray guns sizzling and the Patrol just waiting for the sub-space yell for help to come high-tailing it through hyperspace to the rescue! (Exclamation points optional, but rarely left out). But that was the old days, and this is now the 21st century, and a new brand of space opera has arisen, championed by Ms. Bujold. Somehow the ray guns and exclamation points have disappeared, but not the sense of breathless, pell-mell, don't stop to smell the roses action.<br />This is the latest in her long line of books about Miles Vorkosigan, nimble of mind, short of stature, often subject to seemingly irrational urges towards rash actions. For this book, he is somewhat toned down, perhaps a little more mature, being now a happily married man, as well as having been promoted to be Imperial Auditor.  When his honeymoon is interrupted by a request to go straighten out a diplomatic mess in Quaddie space, about three pages into the book, you just know you're in for another wild ride through Miles' version of how to solve a problem, which is never by just diplomatic means. The `problem' in this case quickly turns into something of a murder mystery (sans body), and Miles must deal with how to gather pertinent information amongst a group of people who are not only antagonistic, but feel that anyone with two arms and two legs (as opposed to four arms) is sub-human and has criminal tendencies.<br />Bujold, as usual, keeps many threads spinning in this adventure tale, from Miles' relationship with a hermaphroditic old friend to a possible all-out war hanging on the resolution of this problem. But perhaps because Miles must now operate very much in the open, rather than as a clandestine undercover operative, there seems to be a little less excitement to this tale than some of the prior works, with Miles only able to operate as a one-man desperado army near the tail end of the book. The tongue-in-cheek humor that suffuses earlier books is not nearly as prominent in this novel, a definite detriment as this was one of the series' basic charms. Characterization for anyone other than Miles is fairly sparse and often rather stereotypical. And the resolution of the murder mystery struck me as somewhat far-fetched, as merely a way to bring in even more far-reaching consequences and complications.<br />Still, a nicely entertaining book, another entry into this new breed of space opera that shows that this type of fiction still has life left in it.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)nent in this novel, a definite detriment as this was one of the series' basic charms.

Science fiction is a medium that is tailor-made for investigation of some of humanity's most perplexing questions, most especially questions of his (and the universe's) origin, God, what constitutes moral behavior, man's ultimate purpose. But very few science fiction novels really attempt to tackle these questions, getting caught up instead in the nifty gadgets that can be imagined, and forgetting their human element. Not so here.<br /><br />Russell has crafted a fine work of character, of people both exceptional and very real, in this tale of first contact between a Jesuit sponsored mission and the denizens of the planet  Rakhat. Emilio Sandoz is the only survivor of this mission, and most of the story is told from his viewpoint, both as a currently happening time-line and a later recollection under interrogation after he returns to Earth. It is easy to become engrossed in this man's life, as we see him as a great linguist, a priest with very understandable doubts but a solid need to help others, a man with normal desires for companionship, a person suffering under sever stress, a man mangled both physically and mentally. The other mission members are not slighted in the character development area, so that by the mid-point of the book, I felt that I was living with a very tight-knit family, whose individual foibles were all well-known and accepted, whose interpersonal banter was enjoyable and fitting.<br /><br />It is this very depth of characterization that adds poignancy to the mission's fate and starkly highlights the main religious question. How can one believe in a God that allows such terrible things as the mission failure to happen? How can one not believe in a higher power that has orchestrated such an incredibly complex universe of objects, intelligences, and events?  Falling within this halo are other questions, ones of personal responsibility against an omniscient deity, institutionalized religion versus an individual call to God, the morality of killing in a culture radically different from our own, when does pride in accomplishment become insufferable hubris? Russell does not provide answers, but her characters each have their own way of dealing with these questions, methods both practical and, for some, esoteric. In this area, this novel is very comparable to James Blish's A Case of Conscience, another fine novel working within this same area of ideas and religious import.<br /><br />There are some elements that are not so good. Possibly most obvious is the idea that a privately funded mission to contact the first verified alien intelligence would not only be the first but the only mission, at least until the rest of the world found out about this mission. Second is the idea that star-travel is so close to being doable that a (relatively) small amount of money and some minor engineering would allow it to become a reality - if it was that close surely someone would have started such a project long before, even without the impetus of alien contact. Third, this is supposed to be the Alpha Centauri star system. From a planet orbiting Centauri A, Centauri C ( a small and quite dim red dwarf) is so distant it would not show a visible disk nor provide any great illumination (it would look like just a bright star), yet there are consistent references in the novel to working under the red light of the third sun. In a work of 'hard' science fiction, such problems would be pretty major. For this novel, with its primary focus on theme and character, these flaws are at most gnats, easily dismissed as not relevant to the overall story.<br /><br />Emotionally and intellectually powerful, this story can upset your life, force a new perspective on your world-view, make you once more sit up and see the sparrow.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)dically different from our own, when does pride in accomplishment become insufferable hubris?

Where the clients might come just for conversation and a place to relax in a friendly, convivial  atmosphere?  Where the House is clean, laid out for comfort, and specially designed to handle everyone's own variant of what they desire most in sex? Where the emphasis is on satisfying the psychological needs of everyone, clients and employees, not just the physical ones?<br />That place exists, somewhere just across the river from the UN building, peopled by a very living set of characters. Lady Sally, proprietress, has some very demanding standards for her employees and just as stiff a set for her customers, though that doesn't mean that talking dogs, cross-dressing multi-millionaires, con men, and KGB spies can't get in.  And the Lady has a very empathic heart, picking up a street hooker in dire straits and turning her into a woman that anyone would love to be around. Maureen was that poor woman, and this book is a set of experiences that she has as an employee of the House. Each of the episodes reads like a fairly long short story, including the incident of the incredibly potent man, the lady whose every word is an absolute command to all those in hearing distance, the gorilla gangster, best known for poking donut holes in a certain part of a man's anatomy, who finds out just what friends are good for.<br />Spider laces each of these stories with his patented brand of humor, from some truly groan-inducing puns to absolutely howling, fall-on-the-floor gags. Shining throughout these stories is his attitude that people are good, and good people go out of their way to help those in trouble. Heart-warming, touching, and yet there is some definite food for thought here. Our society delegates those who engage in sex-for-hire to the very bottom of the social ladder ands treats sex as a given ability rather than an art form than can get better with practice and training, which seems to be a very odd attitude towards an action that is not only necessary but can be one of the most fulfilling exercises of any person's life. Spider shows, by his emphasis on the positive, just why this attitude does not make sense, and just how much it costs in unnecessary human misery.<br />The stories here are only distantly related to Spider's Callahan's Bar series and can be read with full enjoyment without any knowledge of the other books, even though Mike Callahan is Lady Sally's husband, as here he only makes a few cameo appearances. Though if you find you enjoy this book, then you should certainly try some of the Bar series for some more romps through Spider's wacky, macabre, humor-filled, and endearing universe.<br /><br />Although this book revolves around the actions in a brothel, Spider never gets graphic in his depiction of the happenings therein, though the subject matter does preclude handing this to pre-pubescent children.

So much of a bang that it was nominated for the 1968 Hugo award, losing out on the award itself only to another truly brilliant work, Roger Zelazny's Lord of Light.<br /><br />Anthony introduces a multitude of ideas in this work: a flower that shows whether or not your significant other truly loves you, a galaxy-spanning `message' that kills humans in its path by hypothermia, a naturally formed inorganic based consciousness, a type of grub that quite literally eats absolutely everything. But the most significant idea is a genetically modified type of human, the minionettes, all physically identical and the very picture of absolute female perfection, who have their emotional circuits inverted, where the kindest thing you can do to them is hate, abuse, deride, and punish them.<br /><br />Anton Five, knowing nothing of her true nature, has the misfortune to fall in love with one of these minionettes, a love that is an obsession, a mixture of real love and conflicted hate, as the object of his emotions, after only three brief encounters, goes to space.  It becomes his mission in life to track her down, even at the expense of his farm and a rejection of freely offered true love by a daughter of the family of Four. And due to this obsession, he eventually is sent to the prison planet Chthon, where the prison is the naturally formed caves and tubes formed by ancient volcanic action and that no one has ever escaped from. Within this prison are real monsters, truly horrifying and very unique, many of which are seen only from offstage or half-seen, and the very indistinctness this lends to these creatures adds to their effect. Some of the images of this section gave me nightmares for years after the first time I read this book.<br /><br />Anton is a fully delineated character, not very likeable - in fact he's amoral, selfish, a loner, single-minded, and at least something of a psychotic. But there are occasional glimpses of a different man hiding inside, one capable of giving and receiving love, who knows pity and can empathize with other's misfortunes. The story, outside of all the fantastic ideas so casually tossed around, is really about his development into a fully rational human who can allow his emotions full sway when appropriate.<br /><br />The story construction is rather unique, using both flash-backs and flash-forwards from his time in prison. This is deliberately done, as there are a set of parallels/contrasts between the actions in the prison and the actions at other times in Anton's life, which help illustrate the man and his changes. This construction has the disadvantage of lessening the suspense, but the added meaning given by this structure more than compensates for this.  At least part of this book can be viewed as an allegory for the travels of a man through the stages of life, and Anthony buries quite a bit of symbolism inside his creations.<br /><br />The power of this book resides in the changes Anton goes through and its tremendous imagery coupled with some truly different and unique ideas.

But in the mid-sixties he seemed to mature and produced a whole series of excellent to great novels, from Stand on Zanzibar to The Jagged Orbit. This work is part of that period of excellence.<br /><br />If telepathy is a rare but very real talent, just how does society as a whole make productive use of it? One obvious use is to find out exactly what is wrong with people who are mentally ill, to become the ultimate psychiatrist, and if the talent extends to 'projection' of thoughts onto another brain, to effect corrective changes in the ill mind. With acceptance of this talent, the definition of 'ill' could possibly be extended to those who are violent, the trouble-makers of society. Coupled with a far more effective UN than exists today, telepaths could be used to help defuse the attitudes and situations that lead to revolutions and wars. This is the background against which Brunner tells a tale of a child of just such an aborted revolution, a child born with physical deformities, an uncaring mother and a dead father. Gerald Howson grows up without hope, the object of ridicule, trapped in a cycle of minimal dead-end jobs that are limited by his deformities.<br /><br />But in his early twenties, he suddenly finds that he is one of the fabled telepaths, and a very powerful one. His first real use of the talent is to draw a deaf and dumb girl into a detailed fantasy, made more than real by his talent, a fantasy neither would really wish to wake from.  Forcibly dragged out of this fantasy by other telepaths who have tracked down his radiated power, he is taken to the UN center for training and rehabilitation. But Gerald is far from a whole man at this point, and the story of his growth and maturation forms the balance of the work.<br /><br />The characterization of Gerald is excellent, a man we can see change and empathize with. Many of the secondary characters are just as sharply delineated, and the interplay between them and the envisioned world society so dominated by the actions of the UN peace-keeping forces forms a convincing picture of what could be. Issues of privacy, individuality, self-responsibility, and the proper use of power form the thematic backbone, highlighted against some vivid scenes of internal mental worlds that demonstrate just how alluring living inside such a fantasy can be.<br /><br />Portions of this book are somewhat dated, from the use of typewriters to a stated method of trying to combine music and visual form, which has been long superceded by modern computer integration of the two. But these technological items are almost irrelevant to the thrust of the story, of just what it is that man does beyond surviving to give him that inner feeling of correctness and satisfaction with doing something that is worth doing.<br /><br />Incomprehensibly out of print, this book was nominated for the 1965 Hugo Award, and to my mind is better than the book that won that year, Fritz Leiber's The Wanderer.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)ust as sharply delineated, and the interplay between them and the envisioned world society so dominated by the actions of the UN peace-keeping forces forms a convincing picture of what could be.

Perhaps it's a reaction to the minimalist school, but when carried to excess, it severely detracts from the power and impact a novel such as this should have.<br /><br />Wolfe introduces his primary character of Charlie Crocker with immediacy and bright coloration, painting a fine portrait of a self-made real-estate developer who is egotistical, arrogant, crude, politically incorrect, charismatic, and utterly convinced of his ability to surmount any obstacle. A little deeper in, and Charlie's problems begin to come to light: severe money problems from an over-optimistic real estate development, with his major loaning bank starting to put the screws to him, his young second wife and his son by his first marriage start to put a crimp in his uncultured red-neck pastimes and speech patterns, Charlie's own fears of just possibly getting to be 'over the hill'.

Wolfe is not happy unless he describes every character's (no matter how minor) physical characteristics and dress, every scrap of furnishing in every room, every building (right down to who the architect was), every lawn and garden, till I felt I was drowning in all these set pieces, while the story action stalled.<br /><br />His second major character, the antithesis of Charlie in terms of money and social position, Conrad Hensley, is making his way downward in social strata, from warehouse laborer to unemployed to prison inmate. The sequence of events that lead him to this position is a great parody of life - absolutely everything that could possibly go wrong does. Most of the book that is told from Conrad's viewpoint seems more 'alive', more real than the sections dealing with the upper crust of Atlanta, although perhaps there is too much emphasis on street and prison slang.<br /><br />Clearly these two characters are meant to come together in some way, though separated by a continent and just as large a social distance, and at the same time the issues of race and political strategy that permeate the Atlanta scene must be folded into the mix.  It was here I found more objections to this novel than ones of mere wordiness. Charlie; Wes, the mayor of Atlanta; Martha, Charlie's former wife; Roger Too White, the lawyer 'defending' the black football star; Roger Peepgass, the minor executive at Chalie's bank - all of these characters seem to have no central guiding principle, are willing to compromise on anything, and have no moral compass other than keeping up appearances, almost the exact opposite of an Ayn Rand novel. The only person who seems to have some inner principle is Conrad, who at least in the beginning can't express it well. But while in prison he is introduced to the ideas and commentaries of the Stoic philophers, and accepts their philosophy as his own. All well and good as a nice diametric opposition, but now Wolfe gets carried away in trying to present his 'message', and brings in a very out-of-character and unbelievable conversion of other characters to this philosophy. I felt this spoiled a lot of what had been up to this point a very believable 'slice of life' portrait of the both high and the mighty and the low and feeble.<br /><br />There are some fairly sharp satirical sequences here, such as both 'inner thought' sides of a date between the definitely not-young Martha Crocker and Roger Peepgass, and the strength of characterization keep this book from falling into the realm of 'impossible to read'. But the badly structured introduction of philosophy and the totally excessive wordiness defeated its attempts to be something more than just another novel of everyday living.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)	2003-01-25

The Big U is Stephenson's send-up of college dormitory living: colliding monster stereos, hazing taken to the extreme, diddling tenured professors, cafeteria food-fights complete with Uzis and tanks, computer geeks, BMOC's, fraternal cliques, ineffectual student governments, and a myriad other things that seem to be part and parcel of the entire college 'experience'. Many of his apparently totally outrageous situations and incidents were (happily or unhappily, depending on your point of view) all too common in the colleges of the mid-80's when this was written and continue, with little change, today. Parents of college-bound teens, be warned!<br />Unfortunately, the book shows his inexperience at writing, this being his first published novel. The humor that he handles so well in Snow Crash, The Diamond Age, and Cryptonomicon is very inconsistent here. Many of his satirical points are presented a little too baldly, and the barbs sometimes take the aspect of a diatribe rather than a succinct observation of human foibles. His depiction of a near-rape, while obviously intended as an extended ironical comment on the non-limits of courtship behavior as practiced by all participants within the hot-house atmosphere of the confined close order living of a co-ed dorm, comes far too close to reality, a very horrifying one, and far away from the humorous tone that he was trying for. In the later stages of the book the plot line becomes an exercise in the surreal, from Dungeons and Dragons played for real (not that such things did not happen, but Stephenson's portrayal reads more like fantasy at this point) to a plot by the janitors to take over everything.<br />Characterization is somewhat flat, at times stereotypical. Of course, some of the stereotypes are intentional, as in any decent satire, but here some of the main characters come off the same way, when they really need some good development as individuals to further the story line in a (semi) logical manner.<br />Definitely good for a few laughs, and several more smiles and chuckles, but with too little control over plot, character, and level of humor to make this a first-order book. A good first effort, which any Stephenson fan will appreciate if only for its historical interest, but nothing great.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd...itely good for a few laughs, and several more smiles and chuckles, but with too little control over plot, character, and level of humor to make this a first-order book.

Although their ostensible mission is to find the missing members of an earlier Russian exploration team, the book quickly turns to unraveling the mystery of how and why all the current time denizens of the planet appear to be devolved representatives of earlier highly civilized species.<br /><br />The is the best aspect of this book, as in working out the mystery, there are some fascinating portrayals of multiple different species working within an overall society that may be the ultimate in enforced harmony. There is far more emphasis here on the real sciences of the cultural, anthropological, linguistic and biological variety than was present in the original books, and the basic plot provides for quite a bit of suspense and surprise, invigorating this tale with page-turning expectations. The mind-twisting consequences of time travel are reasonably worked out here, although without really answering the basic paradox inherent in time travel capabilities.<br /><br />What isn't quite as good is the basic characterizations, usually one of Norton's stronger points. Ross Murdock and Gordon Ashe don't quite seem to be the people they were in the earlier books, and most of the Russian contingent seem very sketchily drawn. Murdock's relationship with his new wife Eveleen seems very artificial. However, Saba, a new character for this book, is very competently drawn, and she pretty much carries the book.<br />Stylistically, this book tends to more complex vocabulary and sentence structure than Ms. Norton normally uses, which I have to attribute to her collaborator. This added complexity seems to help add some muscle and a believable tone to the story.<br /><br />A competent tale and a worthy new entry to the Time Trader series, a series that helped establish Norton as one of the premier writers in the SF field long before women writers became fashionable.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)ex vocabulary and sentence structure than Ms. Norton normally uses, which I have to attribute to her collaborator.

This book instead looks at what would happen if an entire town is transported back to the middle of 17th century Germany, during the middle of the Thirty Years War.<br />The town in question is a quiet West Virginia town of about 3,000 which at one point subsisted on proceeds of its coal mine, now shut down, but which has left the legacy of a great number of the town's adult men being UMWA union members. When plopped down in Germany, the union's leader, Mike Stearn, effectively takes charge and begins the process of not only turning the town into a self-sufficient entity but also melding it into a major player into the politics of day.<br />The good things about this work are its intense descriptions of the battle techniques and weapons of the day and what a difference a little bit of modern firepower can make, its obviously well researched look at the politics and religious battles of the Europe of that age, an interesting look at the position of the Jews within this society, and its easy reading style.<br />On the negative side, characterization, while adequate, is not very deep for anyone. The motif of 'love at first sight' is way overused. How the town makes the transition from 20th century technology to a stripped down mix of 18th and 19th century level is not covered in enough detail to make it convincing, which is a shame as this could have been one of the most interesting aspects of this novel. The ready acceptance by the German peasants of not only the technological marvels but also the concepts embodied by the Bill of Rights strained my suspension of disbelief mightily, even though it made an excellent theme for the novel. And finally the scene where the King of Sweden, Gustavus Adolphus, comes galloping on horseback to the rescue of the town's schoolchildren came across as both melodramatic and unnecessary.<br />Still, like many novels that occupy this sub-genre, it all makes for a good, fun read, with an interesting look at the history and people of that time.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)ry. <br />Still, like many novels that occupy this sub-genre, it all makes for a good, fun read, with an interesting look at the history and people of that time. <br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)	2002-12-29

Due to this copious output, he frequently had more than one story in a single issue of Astounding magazine, necessitating his use of several pen names. This story, as it did not fall into his 'Future History' chart, was first published as by Anson MacDonald, though its style and subject material, being so different from most of what was being published at that time, pretty clearly marked who the author really was.<br /><br />This is a book of many and various ideas, both social and scientific, some of which may seem a little ludicrous, others of which are very valid and of great import to today's society.  One of the most confounding ideas presented here is the idea that government should not be taxing people, but rather should be distributing money to all citizens so as to provide as much new money in circulation as there has been in new production of products. Next up is an idea that an openly armed citizen will command respect and demand polite behavior, while those who choose to go unarmed are to some degree second class citizens - an idea that probably was not very well thought out for all of its implications, unusual for Heinlein. But most prevalent is the idea of managing the human genome to produce a 'better' human, better in this case being defined as 'entity most able to survive under changing conditions'. The converse of this is also shown, of what happens when genetics are manipulated to produce particular types of supermen (or monsters, depending on your point of view).  This, written at the height of Hitlerian rhetoric, is remarkable for is perspicacity and its ultimate relevance to today's debate about the ethics of all forms of genetic engineering from cloning to stem-cell research.  Not satisfied with just these ideas, the latter half of the novel tackles the age-old questions of life-after-death, reincarnation, and when a fetus becomes a human.<br /><br />So this book is loaded with interesting ideas, but it is also very definitely an early effort, with numerous indicators that Heinlein had not fully learned the craft of writing. As it is, there is some evidence that at least parts of this novel were a re-write of his first never-published (and since destroyed) novel, For Us The Living, apparently written somewhere around 1937. That date may be significant, for as we start this book, we find a utopia where there is no hunger, no poverty, no need to work to earn a living, though many do. It is also around the time frame of 1937-1938 that Heinlein was heavily involved with the social program EPIC (End Poverty in California) that was championed by Upton Sinclair, and it is apparent that at least some of the ideals from that program provided some of the impetus for the society Heinlein presents in this book.  As is typical for first novels, though, there is a tendency to include sub-plots and incidents that don't further the ultimate aim of the novel. The entire first half, with its emphasis on the actions of a misguided revolutionary group, has almost zero relevance to the second half of the novel - it's almost as if there were really two separate books here that have been forcibly mated, to the detriment of both halves.  Coincidence plays far more of a role than it should. Characterization is very spotty, with Felix, the protagonist, reasonably well portrayed, but most of the other characters, and especially the women, are very two-dimensional. Dialogue is dated with forties slang, and there is too much telling, rather than showing, of much of the more scientific detail.<br /><br />But even with all these flaws, this is still a fascinating book, with its multiple ideas and opinions to keep your head engaged, with the action fast enough to hide most of the problems.  Not the best, nor even the second best of his works, but still veryrecognizably a Heinlein novel.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)novel.    --- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)	2002-12-27

Playful with words, concepts, and history, Eco will twist your conception of Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa, his court, the third and fourth Crusades, paradise on Earth, religious dogma, relics and their sources, till it becomes difficult to tell the real from the unreal. So much so that when two thirds into the book Eco changes from his variant of history to an out and out Cabellian fantasy, complete with unicorns and other less savory creatures, it comes across as merely another short step in the journey of his accomplished liar and linguist protagonist Baudolino.<br /><br />And what a main character Baudolino is! For every major historical event, from Barbarossa's sieges and compromises with various Italian cities and popes to the discovery and placement of the Three Magi of Cologne, Baudolino is not only there, he is the major instigator.  From the opening of the book, when we meet him as a young boy worming his way into Friedrich's graces with his quick wit and tongue, Baudolino is an engaging rascal, full of himself and his own (justified) ability to turn the course of history with a well crafted falsified parchment here, a poem (as presented as by someone else) there, or a quiet word with the Emperor carefully couched in just the language the Emperor wishes to hear.<br /><br />But this also brings up one of Eco's major themes of this book, on just what is real and true. If people believe in it, does it matter that the relic worshiped as the Holy Grail is actually a common wooden bowl? If the lie will serve a greater good, is it really a lie? If someone, somewhere, declares that something exists, then does it really have an existence? Where is the line between fantasy and reality? Of course, at the same time that Eco is investigating these points, he is also rather savagely satirizing various religious beliefs and demonstrating the hilarity of the life and death dissension of various religious sects over incredibly tiny differences of interpretation of some element of dogma.<br /><br />As usual, Eco is not an easy read. Besides his liberal sprinkling of Latin, German, and other languages throughout the text, the ideas and history he is presenting are not for the faint of heart or one totally ignorant of this period.  Without at least some knowledge of this historical period and Catholic religious dogma, a good portion of what he is saying will be overlooked. A good dictionary should also be a constant companion while reading this, as he often uses some very uncommon words, and sometimes intends some of the lesser known meanings of other more common words.<br /><br />There are some elements that don't totally work here. I felt his inclusion of a locked room murder mystery within the main body of the work was not really necessary from either a plot or character development standpoint, and plot elements that are linked to this could have easily been handled differently. This element almost seemed like it was tacked on as an expected thing for an Eco novel. The long fantasy section seemed to go on much too long, with rather tiresome long lists of the various creatures and their characteristics.  Most of the characters other than Baudolino seem rather two-dimensional, and if they had been given some further rounding, I think Eco's satirical side could have been sharpened. None of these faults are really major, but they do detract somewhat from what is otherwise an outstanding novel.<br /><br />Different, difficult, discerning, and ultimately deserving of an attentive read.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd...ion of some element of dogma.

Eisenhower is in the White House, following a long line of military men to reach that post. And this slim book appears, presenting the wild idea of an actor, perhaps not even a very good actor, who manages to reach the position of head of state. Obviously an idea like this could only appear within the realm of science fiction! What a difference in perspective an additional twenty five years will make, as once more science fiction becomes fact.<br /><br />The route Lorenzo Smythe takes to reach this post is, however, just a little different from that of the real-world actor. The Great Lorenzo, as he styles himself, is conceited, arrogant, out of work, and down to his last half-Imperial when he is offered the job of doubling for a well-known political figure.  The job is so obviously beneath his dignity that he is ready to turn down the offer when the Martians take a hand, and Lorenzo finds himself involved in murder, kidnapping, and slicing both humans and Martians into small pieces to flush down the disposal.<br /><br />Forced by these circumstances to take the job, Lorenzo is even more disturbed when he finds out the identity of the person he is supposed to double for, none other that the leader of the opposition party, Joseph Bonforte, whose politics, what little he knows of them, he despises. But his own inflated idea of his abilities allows him to steady down and start studying for the role, a role he will play for much longer than he could ever anticipate.<br /><br />This book is a character study, carefully and artfully detailing how Lorenzo changes under the influence of having to pretend to be someone he is not, aided by the immediate staff of the man he impersonates.  It is fascinating to watch him change from someone you probably wouldn't invite into your home, to confused and beginning to search for some moral basis to his life beyond 'the show must go on', and finally to a man doing his best not just for himself, but for all intelligent beings, truly becoming the man he is portraying.<br /><br />The other characters here are pretty sketchy, mainly props to help move the plot and aid Lorenzo. This is most noticeable with Penny, Bonforte's personal secretary, who suffers from the typical Heinlein failing (at that point in his writing career) of portraying women as one-dimensional beings. However, this limited portrayal of these secondary characters does not detract from, but rather enhances by contrast the masterful portrayal of Lorenzo.<br /><br />Heinlein makes good use of his own experience in running for the California State legislature, as he describes the mechanics of running a political campaign, just how decisions are reached, how dependent a politician is upon the quality of the staff he selects, so that these items ring with real-world ambience. This is also probably the first book that clearly showed his leaning towards what would now be called Libertarianism, but this exposition is fairly muted, unlike some of his later works. And it wouldn't be a Heinlein book without his side commentaries: here he covers monarchies, civil servants, patronage, media management, taxes, unions, truth and lies, prejudice and xenophobia.<br /><br />Published at a time when a novel of character was practically unheard of in the science fiction world, this work, like so many others by Heinlein, expanded the boundaries of the field, another step in lifting it out of its self-imposed pulp ghetto and back to the world of literature.  This is probably part of the reason this book earned Heinlein his first of five Hugo awards for best novel of the year, a record matched by no other author. The rest of the reason?

Finally left with no more options on the station, she takes a new berth on a 'shadow' spy ship belonging to what to her is the 'enemy'.  Once on board, she has to earn the respect of her shipmates, put up with sadistic officers, and keep a clamp on her history from 'the other side'. With this as a basic outline, the story really revolves around her continuing growth as a person, stretching herself to perform actions she didn't believe she was capable of, and the (sometimes strange) friendships she makes as she learns the ins and outs of her new shipboard comrades.<br /><br />Told in Cherryh's typical breathless style, often with incomplete sentences, a frequent recourse to alphabet-soup acronyms, and backgrounds that are often only sketched in, the story ripples rapidly towards its climax, making for quick reading. Perhaps a little too quick, as there is a little bit of a rushed feeling to the climax. And as always with Cherryh, this style takes some getting used to, and readers unfamiliar with some of other books in the series may feel a little lost.<br /><br />There is some real action here, of the type that Cherryh is known for, but filtered through Yeager's perceptions. Beyond the action, the item that makes this stand out from the run-of-mill works is the strong character development of Yeager in the face of multiple difficult situations, some of which would have a direct correspondence to the problems of women in the American workplace. Some of Yeager's solutions to certain of her situations will put a new face on casual sexual relations on a mixed gender ship, an item of relevance now for the Navy. But this is not a strident call to the feminist movement, but rather a statement in story form of the real power and necessity of independent women, of women living up to (and being allowed to do so) their full potential.<br /><br />A different viewpoint, a strong female role model, perhaps a little too short and rushed, but still a strong work.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)er ship, an item of relevance now for the Navy.

Some of these works have been good, some not so good, and some just plain bad. This one belongs in the good box.<br />McDaniel brings some strong characterization in the form of Micah Cohen to this dark, sometimes humorous, and frequently satirical work. At the beginning, Micah is shown as a man with low self-esteem, with no confidence in his own ability to change even little things in the world.  His job is one that would fit perfectly into a Dilbert world, from cubicles and meaningless reports to bosses without a clue. In fact, he is so down on himself that he attempts suicide. Being what he is, however, he can't even do a good job of that, much to the distress of Death's assistant Coltan, who shows up after the bungled attempt, carrying a day planner, highly upset that Micah has not died on schedule.<br />After this, Micah decides to break out of his daily routine, to live for the moment and do things right. Now the fun really begins, as he finds his guardian angel Christine, whom he'd unknowingly met earlier moonlighting as a whore, romance blossoms, and the fight is on between Christine and Coltan over Micah.<br />As one might surmise from the above, this book is not for those who can't take their religion with a grain of salt and a willingness to laugh. Buried behind the laughs are some serious thoughts about the real purpose of life, what gives a person a 'soul', how to approach living each day as it comes, and humanity's strengths and weaknesses. These points grow out of the story, rarely directly pontificated, and don't slow down the pace of the story, but will cause a pause upon completion of this book for some serious reflection.<br />The opening of the book is a little slow, not really picking up an obvious direction and tone until about thirty pages in, and McDaniel's prose style is nothing special, but once into the meat of this book, it reads quickly and easily. And other than Micah, who grows and changes throughout the book, the other characters are pretty much set-pieces, with no real depth to them. This is not as bad as it sounds, as the basic plot requires at least one character to remain very much a blank, and several others really and properly are only spear-carriers. But I would have preferred to see some greater depth to Christine, and I think such greater development would have allowed for a few more satirical digs to be implanted.<br />The satire is this book's strength, often laced with irony, and even with an occasional lapse into slapstick.

From these comments, I was all set for another Slaughterhouse Five, but when I finished this I wondered if these book reviewers had read the same book I did. I didn't even break a chuckle, finding instead a large amount of cynicism, retreads of ecological and Vietnam phrases that became trite long before this was published, a main character who entirely monopolizes the book (there is almost no conversation and darn little action), and a story line that very badly extrapolated the society trends of 1990.<br />Certainly, Vonnegut's sharp tongue is present, ripping up academia (and their captive students) as we explore the benefits of prisons run by outsourced Japanese guards, the equivalency of loving and killing, television talk-shows, the mindless drive to wealth normally thought of as the American dream, and, yes, the whole Vietnam experience with his typical precision.

And his patented time-slip style of narration is still present, but it no longer seems fresh. Perhaps what I missed the most in this work was the completely zany worlds that his characters in previous novels occupied inside their heads. This work seemed far too mundane and everyday.<br />Perhaps I read this on a bad hair day, but for my money this is very minor Vonnegut.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)	2002-11-27

I remained enthralled through all the succeeding seven installments, fascinated by the complex interplay of science, politics, religion, economics, ecology and their manipulation by all the various sharply realized characters. As the sequels came out over the years, I found some good, some not so good, but all, including the recent three 'prequels' written by the two authors of this book, at least deserving of existing in the same universe as the original work. Not so with this book.<br /><br />The idea of this book is to bring to life that period in the history of man when machine intelligences ruled most of the human occupied worlds, a period referenced multiple times in the original book, and the supposed origin of both the Bene Geserit and Mentat schools as a reaction to such machine domination. Unfortunately, this book fails miserably at its chosen task for multiple reasons.<br /><br />The first major problem with this book is the characterization. Everyone here is a paper-thin caricature of a human being, from Xavier Harkonnen to Vorian Atreides and everyone in-between. Most of these people are introduced with a short physical description, perhaps a couple sentences to describe their pasts, and are given 'tasks' that pretty much totally define what they are, from Xavier as a military commander to Tio Holtzman as the fading scientist. There is little or no growth of these characters, other than the totally predictable change of heart that Vorian goes through. Dialogue between these people is almost totally limited to the task at hand, with few if any things that would convince me that these were humans talking rather than machines.<br /><br />Then there is the depiction of the machine intelligences Erasmus and the Omnius. Supposedly their great problem is that they can often be defeated by mere humans because they can neither understand nor predict human behavior. But they've had more than a thousand years in control to observe humans, and as one of the definitions of intelligence is the ability to learn from experience, I found this whole scenario impossible to believe. Some of the 'experiments' that Erasmus performs to help him understand human behavior I found both gross and pointless, coming across very much like the gratuitous violence of a bad movie attempting to hide its failings.<br /><br />The story is told in very short chapters, shifting viewpoint character with each chapter. This technique can be effective, as A. E. van Vogt showed so many years ago with his massively re-complicated stories, but to make it work you need either very strong characters or a very complicated, non-obvious plot that can be built in layers, neither of which applies here.<br /><br />The 'science' here is on par with the rest of this book. I thought lines like 'the ship threaded a narrow course through the asteroid belt' and spaceships performing U-turns went out with 1930's pulp science fiction. In fact, this whole book reads as if it was written specifically for a no-brainer Hollywood SF special effects spectacular, and to heck with anything approaching reality or literary depth.<br /><br />This book doesn't deserve to have 'Dune' in the title.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)had more than a thousand years in control to observe humans, and as one of the definitions of intelligence is the ability to learn from experience, I found this whole scenario impossible to believe.

It wasn't always this way, and even today going to some remote locations has at least some difficulties associated with it. This book details the adventures of three very disparate people, an Oxford don, his class conscious daughter, and an independent-minded pilot as they embark on a trip from England to Greenland during the mid-thirties in an attempt by the professor to prove that the Celts came along with the Norsemen during their exploration and colonization period of about AD1000.<br /><br />Greenland is not a very hospitable place, with few inhabitants, almost no ports, unpredictable and typically highly inclement weather, and ice-locked most of the year.  The preparations needed to go there at the time of this novel were extensive, approaching the level of effort of the Scott and Amundsen polar expeditions, though on a much smaller scale. Almost all of this effort falls on the shoulders of the pilot, from purchasing, assembling and testing an appropriate sea-plane to ordering supplies, obtaining the required documents, setting up logistical support bases, and finding and hiring an appropriately skilled photographer, all while working under a time deadline dictated by Greenland's very short summer.<br /><br />Nevil's description of all of this work and the thought processes of his pilot are vivid, detailed, and highly believable. While progressing in the story line, his characters are richly developed. There is a natural antipathy between the working-man pilot and the daughter, who has led a very sheltered upper-class life, who naturally can't believe the cost and preparation required for the trip, so naturally believes that the pilot is merely out to pad his own pocket. But once they embark on the trip itself, the pilot's unstinting devotion to his work slowly wins her over, and a very predictable attraction starts to form between the two.<br /><br />This is very typical of Nevil's work, as he was excellent at characterization and defining romantic attractions in a very believable and satisfying manner. Also typical is the fact that there are no bad guys or any high dramatic tension here. Instead his stories revolve around his characters, often very ordinary people dealing with the very mundane realities of life.  This is a somewhat slow-moving book, typical of English novels written prior to WWII, but once adjusted to this novel's pace, I had no trouble remaining engrossed in the story.<br /><br />There are some items here, though, that are not so good. Shute was an avionics engineer, and his knowledge of airplanes is very much on display here, probably a little too much so, with too many details about the plane gone over multiple times.  There is a section near the end that digresses violently from the main story, almost a separate story in itself, that I did not think Shute did a proper job of preparing the reader for. The final ending that ties the main story and this other one together reeks of mysticism and was, I felt, unnecessary to completing his character's story arc.<br /><br />Still, a very likeable read, probably not at the incredibly high level of things like his On the Beach or A Town Like Alice, but worthwhile reading.<br /><br />---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)very predictable attraction starts to form between the two.

Most of her works are very workmanlike enjoyable reads, but are often quite formulaic, with little to distinguish one work from the next. Not so with this work, written when she was at the height of her powers as a science fiction writer before turning mainly to fantasy.<br /><br />Shann Lantee is left stranded on the alien world of Warlock after the Survey camp of which he was the lowest member is wiped out in an attack by the Throgs, beetle like beings so alien no one has figured out how to have any intelligent discourse with. From this fairly stock beginning this book quickly progresses from learning how to survive under harsh conditions while being chased by the Throgs to an investigation of the power of dreams and the value of being able to distinguish between real and unreal when Shann meets the Wyverns.<br /><br />The Wyverns, the semi-aquatic native race, are masters of the illusion, the dream made real, delvers into the pre-ordained while maintaining the right of individuals to choose their actions. Some of the images Norton paints in describing these people and the tests they impose on Shann have remarkable staying power, haunting and fittingly alien. Norton's thematic points here on the role of fate, individual drive and determination, and the possibility of there being truly intelligent beings that we will never be able to communicate with are all well drawn, never starkly thrown at the reader, but developed naturally from the events of the story. It is these images combined with her strong thematic points that elevate this book well beyond the standard young-man adventure story, though it is also a very good example of that type of page-turning story.<br /><br />Norton's prose is pretty utilitarian, not scaling the walls of the unforgettable line,  but at the same time managing to paint a very coherent picture of her scenes, characters, and concepts. This makes this book both readable and understandable to a wide range of audience ages, from early teen to adult.  At the same time, the 'science' here is pretty soft, mainly techno-babble words and concepts that allow her to set the environment for her story, which she acknowledges at one point by referring the Wyvern technology as 'effectively magic'. This is not really a detriment, as the science is definitely secondary to her story of different kinds of people, human or not.<br /><br />A fine adventure, a compelling look at fate and dreams, an outstanding vision of intelligence in many different forms.<br /><br />---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)able and understandable to a wide range of audience ages, from early teen to adult.

It has been endlessly retold in all types of media, from musicals to film to cartoons. And here we have a very modernized version, one where King Arthur arrives in modern-day New York, clad in traditional armor, which causes an almost immediate plunge down the subway steps, an image which sets the tone for this tongue-in-cheek, sometimes hysterical tale.<br /><br />Of course Arthur can't continue to clank around in thousand year old armor, so he trades it in for a traditional 3-piece suit, courtesy of the American Express card Merlin so thoughtfully provided. But when Arthur looks for something worthy of his talents, the real fun begins as he enters the race for mayor of the city. This is probably the best part of the book, as Arthur pokes large holes in his opposition by coming up with common sense answers to the political questions of the day and by not side-stepping and obfuscating the questions and issues. This is good satire, exposing just how empty the standard political campaign is. Arthur's campaign stance really should be taken up by a live politician - he might be surprised by the voter reaction.<br /><br />Some other pieces of this work are not quite so good. The initial image of Morgana Le Fey as an obese, broken-down maudlin old woman is a scream, but the later scenes after her rejuvenation that attempt to portray her as evil personified don't come off so well. Moe Dred (Mordred) never seems to become more than a stick figure.  There are inconsistencies in Arthur's level of understanding of both English and modern ways of living, sometimes missing an intended meaning or uttering an unintentionally hilarious line, quite understandable given his lack of experience with the New York of today, at other times showing more knowledge of how things work than even Merlin. Arthur's political opposition is not portrayed with any depth, basically an attempt at a caricature of the 'standard' political hack, but it would have been better if they had been portrayed with more depth, intelligence, and political savvy.<br /><br />In concept and satirical level, this is an excellent book that will provoke many grins and an occasional outright laugh, but with a few too many false steps to be unabashedly great.t a caricature of the 'standard' political hack, but it would have been better if they had been portrayed with more depth, intelligence, and political savvy.

Picking up immediately after the end of Jumping off the Planet, we find the dysfunctional Dingillian brothers starting on their trip to the moon, somewhat less mixed up than they were, but still on the run from certain shadowy persona who are extremely interested in the toy monkey they carry. They are taken under the wing of Alexei, a Russian-Loonie money launderer, who proceeds to get the brothers to the moon by most unconventional means, and travel beyond their arrival there via overland foot-trek.<br />Alexei could be a character taken directly from The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, complete with a rather tortured syntax in his English speech patterns, but he is a rather interesting character, far better than most secondary characters. Some of the details of the brothers' forced march across the lunar landscape are a clearly updated version of a similar trek in Have Spacesuit, Will Travel. Gerrold does provide some rather fascinating updates to the technology that Heinlein used, most especially his 'portable' airlock. Most of the details Gerrold describes about the Lunar society belong in the same milieu as Mistress, but he does provide some possibly better economic justifications for why the society is the way it is. He makes clear that the Lunar culture is one built on scarcity, reusing everything to the greatest degree possible, perhaps explaining why this society does not seem nearly as rich and diversified as Heinlein's.<br />Plot-wise, this book is a continuing series of jumping from frying pan to fire to blast furnace. This makes for some fast page-turning adventuresome reading, though occasionally the descriptions of the technology slow down the pace. And there are some serious moral questions being posed underneath the action, questions that can be only partially answered by the protagonist middle brother. Charles' emotional and moral development is really the prime focus of this book, but he seems to make little progress in this book until near the very end. This is the major problem with this book, as Charles and his internal troubles did not do a very good job of engaging my interest, although this aspect was better done in this book than in the earlier Jumping Off the Planet.<br />A pretty good adventure, a nice update of some older Heinlein works, but not top-flight, though this book is better than its predecessor.s moral questions being posed underneath the action, questions that can be only partially answered by the protagonist middle brother.

This book attempts to go even further by trying to prove a hypothesis that science fiction has become so invidiously entangled in the everyday world that is now a given, an everyday component that shapes many of the cultural tropes and the thought processes of Joe Everyman.<br /><br />Disch starts by examining the beginnings of science fiction as a separate literary genre, starting with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and the works of Edgar Allen Poe.  He does an excellent job of examining the themes and ideas that Poe originated, making a strong case that Poe should be considered the ancestor of SF, rather than the more commonly cited Shelley.  But in his examination of Shelley Disch displays the first evidence that this is not a work of critical evaluation of the first rank, as he dismisses her book merely because \\"An unread author is no one's intellectual ancestor\\", ignoring both the possible influence on other writers some seminal works have, commonly read or not, and the fact that Shelley is far from an 'unread author'.<br /><br />This same sloppiness is exhibited in some of his research on other authors, most notably Robert Heinlein and Ursula K. Le Guin. While he correctly presents the oddity that Heinlein, normally considered a strong conservative, at one point in his life ran on the Democratic ticket for a California State Assembly seat and was heavily involved with EPIC, the socialistic movement championed by Upton Sinclair, he repeats (in multiple places) the gossip that Charles Manson was a Heinlein disciple, something easily disprovable by examining the court records of Manson's trial.  Le Guin is lambasted as a militant and underhanded feminist, with little examination of her extraordinary influence and place in the SF world as a strong literary writer whose themes include far more than just the battle of the sexes. In his chapter on religion and SF, once again he seems to be incomplete, showing a lot of material on L. Ron Hubbard, Dianetics, and Scientology, but completely ignoring things like the Church of All Worlds, which originated from Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land, and the fact that the two writers were well acquainted with each other and had discussed the practicalities of 'inventing' a new religion.<br /><br />There are places where Disch is insightful, such as his exploration of the idea that the Star Trek societal model can be taken as a restatement of the perfect modern office culture, uni-sexed and culturally blind. But far too often he seems to ride off on his own personal hobby-horses, from UFO adherents to the Heaven's Gate cult to Reagan's SDI initiative, straining desperately to tie these phenomena to the mainstream of science fiction writing. Many of his bald statements caused me to approach a near-apoplectic condition as they were totally contrary to my own knowledge of events and the science fiction field (and I've been reading the stuff for forty-five years), while only a few brought a nod of agreement. In terms of proving his initial thesis, he is only partially successful, mainly succeeding at the lowest denominator level of Hollywood movies and the apathy of the average American to space exploration as 'old hat', but failing miserably at any good criticism of the literary value of science fiction and its influence on other forms of writing and the world at large.again he seems to be incomplete, showing a lot of material on L.

For those who reached their maturity around this time, who felt the siren call of the counter-culture, every line of this book will resonate, will force memories of and the feel of that time. The character portraits he paints reek of authenticity; the dialogue is real; nothing is left out, no matter how filthy, degrading, lovely, exhalting, boring, unusual or commonplace.<br /><br />Pieces of this experience clearly were incorporated in his massive Dhalgren, and this book and the earlier Motion of Light in Water will help illuminate much of the frequently obscure situations of that book.<br /><br />Between the two books, Delany reveals himself as a man of great and diverse talents: songwriter/singer/guitar player, actor, author, poet (though he doesn't think much of his own work, preferring that of his then wife, Marilyn Hacker), critic, organizer, peace-maker. Rather oddly, though, Delany himself doesn't seem to be the forefront character of this piece, but more of an observer of the scene.<br /><br />Heavenly Breakfast, perhaps because it is so short and covers only a single year of his life, is not as rich as Motion, but is still full of his intense images and great prose: \\"In the other room, the woman-voice wound its obstacle course through consonant-studded invectives.\\" Not many would describe an argument that way.<br /><br />A great trip down memory lane; a sure portrait of a time and place that may never come again.e again.	2002-10-29

On a private ship that is the only locale of this story one of the crew-members (all of whom are named for characters in the legend, on the whim of the ship's owner) gets hold of a tape detailing the Camelot story, and she naturally identifies with one of the characters therein. The ship is grabbed and held in jumpspace by some unknown large body, which requires all the ship members to carefully re-adjust how they 'see' the external world. During this process, the rest of the crew are exposed to the Camelot tape, and to some extent now are compelled to act like their legend's counterparts. The external threat that drives the dynamics of the character's actions comes from the large body that captured the ship, with its denizens apparently trying to break into the ship.<br /><br />While this is an intriguing setup, the particulars of this story don't gel. The parallels with the Arthurian legend are certainly present, but the angst and tragedy of the original are not translated to this book. Perhaps this is because the characters, other than Elaine, the main viewpoint character, are not described in enough depth to make them emotionally engaging. This is especially a pity in the case of Lance, who remains a cipher throughout this book, and yet is one of the most conflicted and interesting characters of the legend.<br /><br />The book does somewhat better thematically, as the question of whether the azi clones really have souls and can truly take independent action beyond their tape programming is explored in some depth. This is a theme that Cherryh detailed in much greater depth in Cyteen, but the main lines of her thoughts in this area are competently presented here, and provide some definite food for thought.<br /><br />One of her 'odder' books, not totally successful, but it is readable, and provides another view of the moral dilemma that made Cyteen so great.<br /><br />---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)successful, but it is readable, and provides another view of the moral dilemma that made Cyteen so great.    ---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)	2002-10-27

Campbell, published the 'Future History', a two page listing of  Heinlein's projection of the significant individuals and scientific, economic, and political events of the next 700+ years, along with a list of story titles that brought each of these events to life. At that time, most of those stories hadn't been written, and from some of the notes and statements in interviews that Heinlein made in the fifties and sixties, it looked like some of those originally projected stories would never be written, most significantly the final entry, \\"Da Capo\\".  Finally, in 1973, when everyone had given up hope, this book appeared, a book that put the finishing touches on the Future History, a book that closes with that final story.<br /><br />But before reaching that final story, we are given a cornucopia of other stories, as Lazarus Long, now some 2300 years old, is induced to reminisce about his life as part of a complex deal to preserve the 'wisdom' of the oldest man alive. Each of the stories that Lazarus relates are fairly complete by themselves, and many authors would have chosen to publish each of them separately, but Heinlein chose to keep them all as one piece, as each story helps to illuminate his overriding theme, on just what is love in all of its myriad aspects and why it is so important to man's survival as a species.<br /><br />The first of the tales, \\"The Man Who Was Too Lazy to Fail\\", may be the weakest of any of the stories, but for those who know something about Heinlein's life, this story is very clearly autobiographical in nature, with some changes in names and places to protect the innocent.<br /><br />\\"The Tale of the Twins Who Weren't\\" brings to light the ease with which Heinlein could switch between first and third person along with some detailed commentary on genetics and the reasons incest is normally consider taboo, all neatly folded into a story of individual growth from illiterate slave to successful entrepreneur.<br /><br />But the next tale, \\"The Tale of the Adopted Daughter\\", is worth the price of this book all by itself. A very quiet, simple tale of pioneering that would not be out of place sitting on the Westerns shelf, though it has a unique science fictional aspect - but by the end of the story tears are definitely in order. The excellence of this story can be judged by the fact that its emotional impact is not lessened even on second, third, and fourth readings, when you know exactly how it ends. This story does much to illustrate that love is far more than just sex, although there is certainly a lively interest in that oldest sport displayed by all participants here.<br /><br />The outer story in which these stories are embedded like sparkling diamonds evolves from a pretty standard plot device for presenting back stories to an intriguing story of its own, as we follow the attempts of various and sundry to give Lazarus a reason for living again, to find some new experiences that are not just a rehash of things he has done a thousand times before.<br /><br />But it is also this 'present' time story that leads to the objections that many people have with this book: its apparent near-obsession with sex between close relatives. In one case it is more than close, it is narcissistic, dealing with Lazarus' relations with twin female clones of himself.  It seems that many see only the sex, and don't look beyond it to the larger picture that Heinlein is presenting of all forms of love, including some essentially platonic forms, and that all of them can provide a means for 'growing closer' with another and enriching the lives of all involved.<br />In-between these stories are the 'Notebooks', a collection of aphorisms and other 'pearls of wisdom' that Lazarus has supposedly collected during his long life. Many are humorous; just about all of them have a spike of truth curling through them. My favorite of this group is probably \\"A committee is a life form with six or more legs and no brain\\" or possibly \\"An elephant: a mouse built to government specifications\\" but everyone will probably find something here that is appealing.<br /><br />The Notebooks are some succinct examples of something that Heinlein scatters throughout this book, his opinions on government, slavery, marriage, politics, revolutions, prisons, family organizations, the value of money, 'consciousness' both organic and computer based, betting, Darwinian selection, true 'intelligence', conscription, advertising, religion, the purpose of war, and just about every other subject you can imagine.

Originally appearing in Analog, they met such a warm reception and requests for more that Spider was almost forced to oblige, even though these stories have only a bare minimum of that 'hard science' feel that is the normal requisite for stories in that magazine.<br /><br />The reason these stories got that kind of reception is simply that they deserved it. All happen within the confines of Callahan's bar, a most congenial place that people seem to find just when they need it, for the patrons of this bar are always willing to listen to and help anyone who truly needs it.  Fully loaded with humanity even when dealing with aliens out to destroy our world or turn us into their own private feed cattle, these stories are tightly plotted, filled with recognizable people from just down the street, and just wacky enough to engage both your interest and your funny bone. Just to add icing to the cake, most of these stories are also loaded with puns (most especially in those stories that occur on Tuesday night, officially designated PunDay), some of them quite good and original, and guaranteed to raise a groan or two. And then there is Tall Tales Night, where some really, really tall ones get told just as sidelights to the main story.<br /><br />The stories I liked the best in this collection were \\"The Time Traveler\\" which is science fiction only by courtesy, but is a riveting story that may have you reaching for your handkerchief, and \\"The Law of Conservation of Pain\\" where science fiction mixes with the world of music in a most painful and joyous manner. These are two of the longest stories here, and Robinson does seem to do better at this length. Some of the shorter length stories, such as \\"The Centipede Dilemma\\", depend too much on a single gimmick or idea to be fully satisfying, but the overall level of this collection is very high. And once you have tasted the flavor of Callahan's bar, you'll more than likely wish you had one just like it around your neighborhood. Alas, the supply of Callahans is very limited, but at least you can read more about this fascinating place in all the other Callahan books Spider has published over the years.ad one just like it around your neighborhood.

In doing so, KSR has set himself the task of recreating almost 700 years of history and all the geo-political, philosophical, religious, and scientific ideas and events that would occur in that span. In some ways, he comes close to succeeding, managing to present viewpoints that are probably very foreign to most Americans in at least a semi-understandable manner. But he also falls off the wagon at times and deteriorates into pedagogy and diatribe.<br /><br />The book starts very slowly, following a single individual as he treks through the incredibly deserted lands of the newly depopulated Europe, and really doesn't pick up speed until we reach The Alchemist, where we see a grand flowering of scientific investigation, paralleling the accomplishments of Newton, Leibnitz, and other European researchers, but from a Muslim viewpoint. Here for the first time in the book do we get some depth to the characters, and a first peek at the overriding theme of the book, on the power and obligation of the individual to do his utmost to change the world for the better, even if only by a miniscule amount.<br /><br />From here on the book is very uneven. Some sections, such as the ones detailing the events in the New World, are fascinating for their different development from our own history. Others bog down in debates over very foreseeable changes in and clashes between various religions (mainly Islam and Buddhism) and their sub-sects.<br /><br />Part of the problem here is his set of continuing, re-incarnated characters between each major section. At just about the point where you become interested in these people, where they have real faces and recognizable emotions and problems, that section will end, and in the following section you have new characters, who have some of the traits of the earlier ones, but often the relationship is not obvious, and the character's names are strange enough to cause additional problems in recognition.  Another problem is KSR's depiction of the bardo, where souls go prior to re-incarnation. His description of this spiritual plane never made a concrete image for me, nor did it seem to make much logical sense.  And finally, KSR's commitment to the ideal of communism at times becomes too strident, with too much of a sugar-coated outlook on the possibility of changing human nature to where that ideal could really form a workable society.<br /><br />So what is good? The grand sweep of this book will eventually catch you up in its implacability, the sense of inevitableness as KSR's imagined world shows so many striking, logical, and ultimately depressing parallels to our own. And by presenting some of the basic tenants of Islam in this fictional form, the reader will come away with a better appreciation of this religion and the possible power of its adherents as a force for good and enlightened investigation into all aspects of the world.  Some of the poetry within these pages will evoke an awed feeling of 'this captures this feeling, this moment, exactly.'<br /><br />A grand idea, an impressive attempt, but with too many flaws to be considered great.  Still, it shows that KSR is not afraid of attempting something new,  something that would give most authors a bad case of palsy to even consider.<br /><br />---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)section you have new characters, who have some of the traits of the earlier ones, but often the relationship is not obvious, and the character's names are strange enough to cause additional problems in recognition.

US	51152905	R2YMHDPV0SAMQI	0385271166	44777253	Stardance	Books	5	9	11	N	N	Dance is a Verb	Come prepared for this book with a large box of tissues; those who find they don't need them while reading this book aren't really human. Spider and his wife Jeanne have created something here that is quite rare in the realms of science fiction, a true mating of music and dance with a story that could only be told within the non-confines of this field.<br /><br />Charlie Armstead, former premier dancer who now makes his living as an audio-visual man for dance companies, meets Sharon Drummond, a young lady who has dedicated her life to being the best dancer possible. But Sharon, though incredibly excellent at her craft, can't get accepted by any dance company because she is physically too big. Charlie, seeing her dance, and knowing the problem she faces, tries to help by going independent with her, helping her define her own type of dance and properly filming it, but nothing works.<br /><br /> Here in this early section of the book, however, we are treated to the impossible: a description in words of music and dance that actually makes you see and hear the dance.  This may be one of the most difficult feats of writing that I have ever read, to translate art forms from the totally different realm of the audio-visual into such a readable, coherent, mental painting that puts you right in the dance studio. And along the way, the Robinson's characters come to life, to where you can feel the triumphs and disappointments, the sweat and exhaustion, the exhilaration and despair of this pair.<br /><br />Up to here, the story could have been told as normal fiction, but now comes the first of the elements that transform this from the world of everyday to the world of the future, as Sharon conceives the idea of doing her unique form of dance in free-fall at an orbiting space station. We watch as she adapts to the new environment, and modifies her dance to take advantage of its properties, and slowly we begin to see her creations as message, as a unique channel of communication.<br /><br />This channel of communication forms one of the lynch-pins of the plot, and the Robinsons do an excellent job of melding their characters with both this item and the very plausible impediments that Sharon and Charlie must overcome.  The conclusion to the first section of this book will shatter you; most of your tissue box will be depleted here. But there's much more, a logical yet surprising continuation that allows for a good exposition of the book's theme of the community of not just man, but a community of mind.<br /><br />Excellent in almost every aspect, the first section of this book deservedly won both the 1977 Nebula and 1978 Hugo Novella awards.  In this expansion to full book length it lost none of its power, and allowed for both greater character development and a vision of the future of mankind that speaks to the reader in an impossible to ignore voice.  Keep your last tissue for the last line; you'll need it.<br /><br />---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)ication forms one of the lynch-pins of the plot, and the Robinsons do an excellent job of melding their characters with both this item and the very plausible impediments that Sharon and Charlie must overcome.

This story illuminates this fact, as we enter the world of Kino, a pearl diver and occasional fisherman, his wife Juana, and their baby son, Coyotito. All they have is a grass shack house, a few clay cooking utensils, and their prize possession, Kino's boat, inherited from his father and grandfather. The boat is the family's livelihood, providing the means to put a meal on the table and to provide a few pesos for store bought goods by selling the small pearls Kino is able to find.<br /><br />But Kino and his family, far from being depressed or unhappy, have a great treasure, the love they have for each other and their satisfaction with life as it is, with few disturbing dreams of greater things. But their quiet, routine life is turned upside down the day that Kino finds a Great Pearl. Suddenly Kino can dream of better things: a rifle for himself, school for his son so he will be able to read and tell what is really in the books, a real house. But dreams can be deadly things. Dreams lead to desire, and desire to greed, and greed to violence.<br /><br />What happens to Kino and family from this point on is not a pretty story. Now we see that underneath the quiet, idyllic seeming small town and its inhabitants lie the seeds of cheating, betrayal, collusion, fear, and murder. And we see the gradual loss of Kino's real treasures. By the end of the book, events have reached the level of real tragedy, and you, along with Kino, are liable to end up in a state of emotional exhaustion.<br /><br />Steinbeck's prose for this book matches his characters and situation very well, a very minimalist sentence structure and set of speech patterns. As a parable, the story has a strong moralistic point, but Steinbeck does not overdrive his thematic message, but lets his story speak for itself. One of Steinbeck's great strengths was his ability to capture on paper the characters he saw around him, and this book is a showcase for that talent. The characters of Kino and Juana are exquisitely drawn, real people you can relate to even though their lifestyles may be very far from your own. And because they are real people, it is very hard not to get drawn into their lives, where their dreams and their pains very readily become your own.<br /><br />This may not be Steinbeck's greatest book, as it is too short and with too limited a focus to compare to something like his Grapes of Wrath. But within its own territory, there are very few other pieces of literature that are even half as good.acters he saw around him, and this book is a showcase for that talent.

This book is this axiom brought to life in a way that will break your heart.<br /><br />The Martians came to Earth 30,000 years ago, exiles from their dying planet. Seeing that human society of that time was not ready for contact with another race, they built their new homes underground and undersea, to wait for that time when humanity will grow up. They send out Observers to monitor what is happening, and occasionally help direct humans towards a more civilized, ethical society. But eventually some of them grow tired of waiting for humanity (and perhaps because one of their undersea cities was located at Bikini island), and decide to try another plan: wipe humanity out so they can take over the Earth for themselves. The conflict between one of these Abdicators and an Observer forms the upper level conflict of this novel.<br /><br />The object both parties focus on, Angelo, is a twelve-year old prodigy, who is both an artist and a budding philosopher, a person who is likely to change human society towards a more peaceful, introspective, and accepting culture. But at Angelo's age he is going through the first problems of puberty and a very normal desire to be an accepted part of his peer group. His self-professed ten-year old girl friend Sharon shows signs of having the talent to become a world class pianist.<br /><br />How both the Observer and the Abdicator meddle in these two peoples lives, how they grow and change, and the resultant effect on mankind as a whole forms the main part of the book.<br /><br />The characters of Sharon and Angelo are superbly drawn, to where you will find it impossible not to become deeply involved with them. By the end of the book what happens to these two will more than likely reduce you to tears (I know I was very damp-eyed).  But beyond these two the character of the Observer also slips into your heart, and the changes in his outlook make for both a bitter and an exhalting comment on what is both right and wrong with humans. This is very typical of Pangborn; all of his work is very people oriented, as opposed to gadgets or grand theories, and here it is presented almost perfectly.<br /><br />There are some aspects of his envisioned future world that will seem either dated or wildly off the mark, (the book was written in 1954), but none of these items seriously impact the focus of this novel. Criminally out of print, this book was the Winner of the 1955 International Fantasy Award.

The End of the Dream was his last book, and it has far more in common with his other great piece of writing, Generation of Vipers (1942). Vipers was a diatribe against almost everything American, from 'Mom' to apple pie, and is still an effective read today. The End of the Dream is Wylie's rant against all the ecological sins that man is committing. I first read this when in was first published in 1972, and many of the images he paints in this book have remained with me ever since.<br /><br />The book is structured as a look back from the 2030s to just where man went wrong, at what places he had a chance to change things for the better but blithely ignored them. For by 2030 there are only four million people left alive, most living in enclosed 'bubble' townships and still very much on guard for whatever the next ecological catastrophe will be.  As a structure for a novel, this is not terrible, but it definitely leads to an episodic approach, and because Wylie really doesn't present any strong, well defined, and continuing characters who exist over the course of this period (the ones that are there are almost stick-figure place holders), this book does not work as a novel at all.<br /><br />Where this book does work is the incredible searing images he paints of various disasters, from a SST crashing into a New York skyscraper (due to a multi-state wide power outage, not deliberately), to the death wave moving up 5th Avenue from a deadly concentration of noxious gases, to the golf course built over a landfill that suddenly collapses into a bubbling stew of toxic chemicals. Perhaps the sharpest, most biting image is of a sudden attack by trillions of mutated sea worms that come ashore and attack practically anything moving, with the sharp irony that the defense against these creatures is to spread oil all around the chosen defended area, which naturally will, in time, become another eco disaster.<br /><br />Although these images are haunting, and in many cases all too plausible, the time frame that Wylie envisions for these events is much too short, as by the 2001 of this book, most of civilization has been destroyed. This, perhaps, was the singular mistake made by many environmentalist voices of the seventies, the mistake of being too extreme and too dogmatic in their claims of disaster around every corner. It's a mistake that has seriously eroded the credibility of many of these voices. Happily, the Earth is a little more forgiving, and rational men have made some positive changes, than the environmentalist movement foresaw or would give credit to.<br /><br />Does this mean then that the dangers Wylie is warning of here are not really a  problem? Not at all. Wylie is very correct in pointing out the many abuses that man still engages in, that have not been adequately controlled, that still can develop into problems of such magnitude that everyone's quality of life will suffer. Although written thirty years ago, just about every problem he describes will be immediately recognizable by today's readers, problems that still must be solved, and vigilance never slackened.  And for this reason, this book should be read and its warnings fully digested.<br /><br />---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)eco disaster.

The spectacular Ender's Game and its very good to excellent sequels established Card as a major SF writer. With Ender's Shadow, he came close to matching the brilliance of the original story. Then came Shadow of the Hegemon, with its focus on Peter Wiggin and Achilles, and it seemed like all the power, originality, and dramatic tension faded away, leaving only a shadow to lay across your mind. This latest work is neither as good as Ender's Shadow nor as mundane as Hegemon, but rather somewhere in-between.<br /><br />Here we find Bean growing beyond the norm, symptomatic of his genetic flaw that will eventually kill him while still a young man. And growing in other ways, as his relationship with Petra finally flowers under her tenacious insistence.  This is probably the best part of this novel, as we see sides of the two that have not been in great evidence in the prior works. And we get some small looks into the thoughts and characters of some of the other Battle School graduates, mainly Virlomi, Han Tzu and Alai, each of whom contribute some major items towards Peter and Bean winning their current battle with Achilles. The Wiggin parents emerge from obscurity and are revealed to be (unsurprisingly) very intelligent and (surprisingly) quite forceful. All good things...<br /><br />So where does this book fail? The main failure is Peter Wiggin himself. For a man who could sway world opinion with his exacting, careful logic as Locke and browbeat everyone into emotional frenzy as Demosthenes, Peter is depicted here as a remarkably stupid, arrogant, and emotional teenager. Achilles, the demon, remains almost totally offstage, providing little room for dramatic confrontations, and what ones there are come off as almost anti-climatic. And finally, the circumstance that draws Bean back into the struggle between Peter and Achilles was totally preventable, a very sad and uncharacteristic lack of foresight by both Bean and Petra. These items do much to kill any major excitement in this work, even though the major (world) battle could have formed a taught political and military thriller.<br /><br />Is this book readable? Certainly. Card is still an excellent writer. His prose, descriptions, and dialogue (especially the back-and-forth between Bean and Petra) are all well formed and his moral insights flow from the premise of the story. But this one just doesn't have the edge-of-the-seat tension, the incredible insight into human character that have been the hallmarks of his best work.<br /><br />---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)even though the major (world) battle could have formed a taught political and military thriller.

Set in the world of Bas-Lag that he first introduced to us in Perdido Street Station, this work shows us a much wider view, a diorama of images and creatures that at first blush seem incredibly impossible, not related to our world at all, but one quickly finds motivations and emotions that ring around both your heart and your head.<br /><br />Tinges of Melville surround the overarching story of the hunt and capture of a true miles-wide Leviathan, but trying to pigeonhole China is an impossible task, as one finds elements from Bram Stroker to Dickens to Richard Burton all thoroughly churned into this mix that China makes uniquely his own. Trying to predict what will happen or what a character will do is an exercise in futility, doomed to failure as China continuously surprises you. His characters, for all their incredible physiognomy, are recognizably human, richly detailed while maintaining depths that are just out of reach.<br /><br />Uther Doul is a true man of mystery, wielding his Possible Sword and twisting events (and possibilities?) for his own unknown desires, the prime mover of the events in this story. Bellis Coldwine is the main viewpoint character, in some ways equivalent to Ishmael of Moby Dick, an observer who nonetheless takes important actions that have definite influences on the final outcome; cold, distant, but yet one who gets caught in more than one love affair.  The Brucolac, a real, practical vampire; Silas Fennac, the New Crobuzon spy; Tanner Sack, a Remade man who is the epitome of loyalty yet will still betray his chosen country of allegiance; each character adds their own touch of flavor and complexity to this bitter and compelling tea. And in the distance are The Lovers, erstwhile commanders of the motley collection of ships that make up the Armada, defined by their odd sexual practices, practices that leave them mirror-image scarred, a metaphor in flesh of China's thematic investigation of the cuts and scarring that happen to and are part of the definition of everyone.<br /><br />China's strength is his incredibly descriptive prose, much in evidence here, but the picture he paints is not as monochromatically dark as it is Perdido Street Station, as he dips his pen with bits and swirls color, highlights poking out of his black felt. His pictures of his diverse creatures are not as detailed as they were in the earlier novel, especially not for those creatures and near-human species that not new to this book.  For this reason alone, I recommend reading Perdido Street Station first, so that one comes to this book steeped in the environment, the depressive bleakness of the earlier work.<br /><br />The plot is a continual set of twisting surprises and seeming diversions, but each part is fully tied to the climax of this work. In this area, this book far exceeds his earlier work, showing all the signs of meticulous planning, where each element is necessary to the story, and events are driven by the complex interaction of each of his characters, rather than mere happenstance or coincidence.<br /><br />My only real complaint with this book was the Coda that is tacked on after the main climax. While this Coda neatly wraps up all the unanswered questions and provides closure to some of the splinter stories, I felt it was unnecessary and spoiled the power of the highly emotional main ending line.<br /><br />With this book, I feel that China has entered the top flight of today's speculative fiction writers, mature, confident of his mastery of the art of story telling, with a voice that uniquely and compellingly his own. I predict this book will take all the various awards for this year, and I can look forward to many more years and many more great reads from this brilliant new fable spinner.<br /><br />---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)	2002-09-22
US	51152905	RJYGHEU5X8QHK	0671877771	544710048	Lifehouse	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Cons, Other Cons, and Pros	This is the third volume in the trilogy that started with Mind Killer and continued with Time Pressure (which are collected together in one volume as Deathkiller).  However, the relationship is tenuous between this book and the other two, and for this particular work I'd actually recommend that you don't read the others prior, as I think it would negatively color your impression of this one.<br />Lifehouse represents a return to Spider's normal outrageous situations and punning humor, couched in a tale of two con artists, Paul and June, SMOFs (Secret Masters of Fandom), and time travelers.  Early in the story the SMOFs (in this case, a husband and wife, Wally and Moira, who have been fans and known each other so long they are almost telepathic with each other) are presented with a wild tale by a midnight visitor who arrives with a bang, minus clothing, and claims to be a time traveler who has unfortunately missed his target date by a few years. Naturally, the 'time traveler' would like  Wally and Moira to help in changing history just a little bit - ensuring that John Lennon does not get assassinated.  Of course, the Wally and Moira are also Beatles fans, and off we go on a pretty wild romp through the ins and outs of multiple con games, time and other paradoxes, manhunts, and puzzle solving the old fashioned way, by thinking.<br />Along the way, Spider maintains a humorous undertone, as noted by chapter titles like \\"Grok and Roll\\" and sentences like \\"They left and locked the car, and, since it was late at night, crossed Point Grey Road on foot without the customary side effect of dying.\\" But much of the story is a serious investigation into ethics, morals (can con-men have morals? Can ethics impose absolute restrictions on the actions of time travelers?), and individuality versus the 'Group Mind' that true telepathy would make possible. The characters come across as highly intelligent, personable, and believable people caught in situations that are only partially due to their own actions, but must (and can) rely on their own wits to save the day.<br />Readers who have never attended a science fiction convention or been seriously involved in SF fandom may miss some of Spider's underhanded references, and some of the specified technology will seem absolutely ancient (which is merely an indication of how fast computing technology is changing). But these are fairly minor quibbles with what is generally a very readable story, one that occasionally made me laugh out loud, always kept me grinning, and provided some good food for thought when finished.ue to their own actions, but must (and can) rely on their own wits to save the day. <br />Readers who have never attended a science fiction convention or been seriously involved in SF fandom may miss some of Spider's underhanded references, and some of the specified technology will seem absolutely ancient (which is merely an indication of how fast computing technology is changing).

US	51152905	R3VKZYBDUJTVKQ	0399148701	17508097	Red Rabbit	Books	3	20	23	N	Y	Jack Without a Hammer	Clancy has many, many Jack Ryan fans, fans who keep demanding more and more about their favorite character. But Clancy has run into a problem: he has already written Jack into the highest post in the land in previous books, and it is difficult to see how he can continue along his fictional future history and keep expanding Jack's role, much like the problem the writers of Superman comics had when Superman became effectively all powerful. So for this book at least, Clancy has sidestepped the problem by returning us to the days when Jack was just a freshly hired analyst for the CIA.  Of course, in this role Jack can't be the prime mover of events, which may disappoint his fans, but at least they get to see a little more of Jack, along with another story of adventure and spy-craft.<br />This story revolves around a Soviet plot to assassinate the Pope, a story crafted around the real events of 1981 (though Clancy takes some liberties with actual dates and concurrent events). Here again this is something of a departure, as Clancy is effectively updating and changing his future history to match the events of the real world, making this book somewhat inconsistent with earlier books in the series. Whether the shooting of Pope was actually plotted by the Soviets is still a matter of conjecture, but it is certainly plausible as the basis for this story. The action revolves around trying to get Oleg Zaitzev, a KGB communications specialist who has critical information about this plot, and his family out of Russia.<br />With these basic elements, it should have been easy to craft a taught, exciting thriller. Especially as Clancy has finally dropped his penchant for having page after page of extreme technical detail interrupting the story flow. But this story does not achieve very much in the way of excitement or suspense at all. I found that all the actions by the various people involved were accomplished way too easily, just about everything goes according to plan. Even the ruse to make it appear that Zaitzev has died rather than defected comes off as just another day at the office, even if it is rather gruesome. This may be closer to the real world of the CIA and KGB, but it doesn't provide for a great reading experience.<br />I also found Zaitzev's attack of conscience, his reason for defecting, just a little too rapid and convenient to be thoroughly convincing. Andropov's portrayed character (at that time head of the KGB) was a little more believable as a pragmatic and coldly calculating man. Jack is still Jack, and Clancy did a good job of returning to the Jack of the eighties, a little unsure of his value to the CIA and his importance in the world, a little more impetuous than he would later become.<br />At best, this is an average spy novel, with too little suspense to be really absorbing, even if well written. A must for Ryan fans, others can skip this one.use to make it appear that Zaitzev has died rather than defected comes off as just another day at the office, even if it is rather gruesome.

Few authors have had the temerity to write works that use the Heinlein model as their basis, but Gerrold has attempted it here.<br />As a starting point, Gerrold takes a very dysfunctional family consisting of three brothers, all of whom have various highly anti-social character traits, and their divorced parents, who are constantly squabbling over custody and visitation rights to their children. He places them in a reasonably near-term future, where the multi-national corporations have pretty much taken over, 17 billion people are voraciously consuming what little resources planet Earth still has, and the defining technological development is the 'beanstalk', a massive wire hung from geosynchronous orbit all the way down to the planet surface and extending upwards nearly as far for balance.  The father, at the end of his wits and finances, decides to 'kidnap' his children and take them up the 'beanstalk' as the first part of a journey to the moon and beyond in an attempt to leave his troubles (and legal jurisdiction) behind.<br />The story is told from the viewpoint of the middle 13 year old brother, who feels 'left out', that his parents and brothers never really talk to him or deliver on their promises, leaving him cynical and withdrawn. As the story progresses, he begins to develop his own sense of responsibility for his actions and depend less on the 'that's not fair' type argument. Unfortunately, most of this development is somewhat hidden from the reader till near the very end of the book, where the statements he makes seem to almost come from nowhere, as too little of his underlying thinking has been previously shown. Starting as a complete techno-geek with few defining human characteristics, the eldest brother is only slowly developed, so that only at the end of the book does he come to the point where he seems like a real person worthy of your notice. The youngest brother starts as and remains a near cipher, a tool for showing the need for parental discipline and allowing brotherly responsibility to be exhibited.<br />Still, Gerrold is better in his characterizations than while trying to explain the technology of his world. While the ideas are good, sometimes exemplary, such as his concepts on the flow of various types of money, his exposition is too often dry, near academic in tone. Here he definitely suffers in comparison to Heinlein, who could write twenty page essays on the care and feeding of space suits and remain entertaining and continue to further his story line during the exposition.  On the other hand, the courtroom scenes that Gerrold presents are just as good (and very similar in tone and action) as any of Heinlein's, and his societal ideas (such as being able to divorce your parents) are very much in the Heinlein tradition.<br />There are some items touched on here that Heinlein could never have gotten by the editors of his time, such as homosexuality (of both sexes) and certain bodily functions. While these items play a role in the story development, they are not gone into in any detail, though it might have made a better, deeper book if they had been. But with these items, it makes the book unsuitable for very young readers.<br />Even with these flaws, this is still a good, very readable book that brings the old Heinlein model into the world of today. Today's teens may find this book more relevant, more in tune with their world, than the older Heinlein works.slowly developed, so that only at the end of the book does he come to the point where he seems like a real person worthy of your notice.

US	51152905	R2ONPY5AJ1GN7U	0425062880	208930603	Mindkiller	Books	4	8	9	N	N	The Power of Thought	Reaching the ultimate 'high' has been the goal of a considerable portion of the human race for a very long time. The methods used to try to reach that point have ranged from an incredible variety of mind-altering drugs to deep meditation to self-induced hypnotic trances. So when a new way of reaching that high comes along, direct electrical stimulation of the mind's pleasure center via a surgical implant and a small external device, is it any wonder that a significant number of people would jump for it? And once connected, that there would be some who desire its pleasurable effects so much that they would die happy remaining connected while their bodies waste away from dehydration and starvation?<br />From this beginning idea (which has also been the subject of treatments by authors such as Larry Niven), Spider goes not just one, but several steps further. Seeing that this technology is just the beginning of deep research into how the mind and memory really work, he envisions that it would eventually lead to knowledge of how to erase selective memories, how to index and store them, and eventually how to transfer them from one person to another.<br />The story is wrapped around this idea, beginning from Joe, a man missing some of his own memories and totally hidden from society's identification systems,  finding Karen, nearly dead, hooked to one of these pleasure tasps, and his slow succoring of her back to health. When they go on a crusade to destroy the maker of such hideously addictive devices, they stumble across information leading them to believe there is one man who controls not just these devices, but has the power to erase a person's memories at will, a power so immense, and so impossible to trace, that he can do anything he desires. As a parallel track, we follow the story of Norman, an assistant professor whose life is falling apart, from his marriage to his job, whose older sister mysteriously disappears one day, and his search for her. Spider does a good job of tying together these disparate threads, with a conclusion that may seem a little over-dramatic but which drives home his thematic points.<br />His themes deal with just how absolute power may not corrupt, but instead ennoble, but with an under-text of 'end justifying the means'; of a possible goal of really being able to understand how someone else feels by actually 'reading' their thoughts; of identity and right to privacy; of when and to whom loyalty should be given; and 'Chinese' obligations. Some of his thoughts on these subjects seemed a little facile to me, not completely thought through or all consequences investigated, but they are all, within the context of this story, very thought provoking.<br />Joe, Karen, and Norman are all very well realized characters, in many ways very reminiscent of some of Robert Heinlein's character types, which is not surprising as Spider honors Heinlein as one of his main mentors. These characters have strength, intelligence, and inner integrity; character traits that are rarely seen in many modern novels.<br />A good read, a few surprising twists along the way, but perhaps not a deep enough delve into the ethical and philosophical questions he raises to really make this an outstanding novel.od job of tying together these disparate threads, with a conclusion that may seem a little over-dramatic but which drives home his thematic points.<br />His themes deal with just how absolute power may not corrupt, but instead ennoble, but with an under-text of 'end justifying the means'; of a possible goal of really being able to understand how someone else feels by actually 'reading' their thoughts; of identity and right to privacy; of when and to whom loyalty should be given; and 'Chinese' obligations.

As a direct continuation of the story begun in Heavy Time, we meet Pollard, Dekker, Sal, and Meg again, now involved in the prototype testing of the first of the rider ships that figure prominently in later stories about the Alliance/Union war.<br />But, like most Cherryh novels, very little happens in a simple, straightforward way. Instead of proper, objective testing, with each test run's results carefully and scientifically analyzed and appropriate changes made, we find ourselves in the middle of a horrendously complicated multi-corner battle between the designing corporations, Senatorial committees, two competing military factions, and near social war between Earth-born test pilots and those raised in the asteroid belt, each of whom is driving their own point of view of how the equipment should be configured and the pilots trained. And just to throw in a further complication, we start the book with Dekker back in the hospital after a disastrous simulator accident which may be no accident at all, but rather attempted murder. But Dekker can't remember how or who put him in the simulator.  The problems of the 'Hellburner' itself, of how you handle an attack ship moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, where your targets must be described in terms of probability arcs, of vector changes and millisecond decisions even with major computer help, are fascinating in their own right, an excellent setting around which to weave her plot.<br />How Cherry resolves all the plot complications is exemplary, and along the way she makes some striking points about bureaucracies, military organizations, graft, political 'influence', leadership qualities and styles, and the beginnings of the ethical morass of the 'azi' clones that she covered so well in Cyteen.  Her ending is not telegraphed, and ties up all the loose ends while setting up the situation and people of her later books of this universe.  About the only real disappointment was her solution to Dekker's 'accident', as it did not tie directly to any of the major players or points of the novel.<br />Characterization is very strong. Pollard, only partially developed in Heavy Time, here becomes a real, believable person that is easy to identify with. Lt. Graff (an important player in later stories) is easily recognizable to anyone who has ever served in the military, and even Dekker emerges from amnesiac cipher-hood to become the embodiment of the pilot with the 'right stuff'.<br />Once again, though, readers unfamiliar with Cherryh's style may have a very rough time getting into this book, with her clipped, abbreviated, and incomplete sentences riddled with abbreviations and alphabet-soup acronyms. For this reason I'd highly recommend reading Heavy Time directly prior to this novel, though it is not absolutely required, as then the reader will start this book with both the background to this story and familiarity with this style.<br />One of her better books, on par with Downbelow Station, though not quite up to the brilliance of Cyteen, and an excellent introduction to her entire Alliance/Union universe.ation and people of her later books of this universe.

How do you know if you're mentally stable? What should the limits of corporate power be?  These are some of the questions that Cherryh asks in this book, and gives at least some intimation of what the answers should be.<br />This book represents the earliest shown time-point in the Merchanter/Alliance/Union universe, before the war has really broken out, and stays entirely within the solar asteroid belt and at sub-light speeds for its action. Here we have the ASTEX company controlling the great majority of the mining of the asteroids, with only a company limited role for independent prospectors.  The main story revolves around Dekker, rescued from his damaged ship by two other independents, Pollard and Bird, and the slowly brought to light details of just how Dekker's accident occurred in the first place.<br />Dekker, with all his mental problems from his accident, and Bird, as the older, experienced independent prospector, are very well realized characters. Pollard is not as fully realized, but he is far more fully developed in the sequel to this book, Hellburner. The society of miners, the space station environment, and the economic structure are a little hard to get your mind around at first, as Cherryh presents bits and pieces of these items almost as side items to her action and dialogue. But by the end of the book, you begin to realize just how well she has created and defined this near self-contained world, so different from most Earth societies, but with recognizable points of similarity, of definite humanity.<br />The problems of this book come from this same style of presenting facts to the reader in regards to celestial navigation. Unless you are well versed in this subject, and can extrapolate from a single sentence of description to an entire scenario of vectors, g-forces, and delta-v requirements you will probably find that there are several action sequences that either don't make much sense or don't carry the high feeling of danger that they were intended to.  This is minimization of expository material taken to the extreme.<br />Cherryh's prose style for her Merchanter books has always been very abbreviated, clipped, full of unexplained acronyms, with a large number of incomplete sentences. This style is good for providing a sense of tension and fast action, and does well in this book as she slowly reveals the details of just how the Company is trying squeeze out all the 'little' people and take total control of the Belt, but it does take some getting used to.<br />The action of this story drives Cherryh's thematic points, on the need for human independence and companionship, the depths of unbridled greed, the tenuous line between real and unreal within the mind, and the necessity for all people to keep on doing what is possible, regardless of odds.<br />A very good action story, but really needed a little more background and explanatory material to make a solid, cohesive whole.

And from the Word understanding flowed, and gave substance to the material world. A Symbol: a Name: Rydra Wong. Poet. Cryptologist. Starship Captain. Woman. Co-opted to decipher what Babel-17 is, what meaning it has, what connection there is between war-plant sabotage and the usage of Babel-17.<br /><br />Inside, around, and terminally intermixed with this nominal space opera is the quest to define the relationship between language, symbol, object, and thought process. A quest that flows around surgical body-form manipulation, the senses of the discorporate, succubi , the revival of the dead, love triples, starship pilot wrestling, a society and personality types split between Customs, Transport, and military. All told with Delany's inimitable sense of the English language, with the admirable support of excerpts of Marylyn Hacker's (Delany's then wife) poems.<br /><br />Delany has developed this theme of language as the controlling factor in a person's world map in several books, but this is the only one that I can think of by him or any other author where language is not only a weapon but the main driving force behind the plot. In making his point, he almost goes too far, giving powers of understanding to Babel-17 that stretch the boundaries of believability, although he makes the very relevant point that some concepts cannot (or only with great difficulty) be expressed in some languages, while in other languages the same concept can be expressed very precisely in just a few words.<br /><br />The characters of this book are far more normal than the typical set of Delany people, which is not to say that they are not extremely interesting, engaging, and well presented. And as part of the character set, we learn that Rydra was once part of a love triple, the other members of which, while just names in this book, play a major role in the follow-on novella, Empire Star.<br /><br />Having had your world view expanded by Babel-17, be ready to have it totally turned upside down, twisted into circles and hyperboloids by Empire Star, where a person's world view can be described as simplex, complex, or multi-plex. Here we find Comet Jo, a simplex person who observes an organiform star-ship crash and who is given a message to take to Empire Star by one of the ship's dying members, who looks exactly like himself. In the process of taking the message, we watch as Jo grows to complex, then multi-plex maturity as he meets San Severina, owner of seven Lll slaves (ownership of which causes the owner to experience continuous unbearable sadness), LUMP (a linguistic ubiquitous multi-plex computer), and learns about the battle to free the Lll slaves. But at just about the point where you think you have a standard, straight-forward story, curve-balls of time-travel, causality, and mirrored relationships come to the fore, and twist this story (and by its relation to Babel-17 that story also) into a pretzel of deep complexity that will leave you scratching your head while fully satisfying your emotional requirements.<br /><br />Within these two stories, Delany packs more original ideas than most authors would in ten novels, and does it with great style and panache.  Written very early in his career, they fully deserved the Nebula Award and Hugo nominations they received, and read just as well today as when they were first published.<br /><br />---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)e it totally turned upside down, twisted into circles and hyperboloids by Empire Star, where a person's world view can be described as simplex, complex, or multi-plex.

Everyone else can't hear it, and can only refer to it by its new name of Lower Corte. And why should such a spell be cast? To wipe out the history, the very memory of this land forever, as its army had the temerity to kill the son of Brandin, sorcerer, warlord, and tyrant.  The only problem with this spell is that Brandin has to remain in the conquered territories until all those who can still remember Tigana have died.<br />For a political and economic climate, Kay has chosen as a model the feuding duchies of Italy in the middle ages, with competing warlord Alberico ruling four of the territories of the peninsula, Brandin over another four, and one territory still nominally independent and the object of much maneuvering. The final major player is Allesan, prince-in-hiding of Tigana, who is carefully fomenting unrest in the territories as part of a long-term plan to depose both Brandin and Alberico and unite the peninsula. This model works well, as it gives a richness and verisimilitude to the political plotting that is absent in almost all other fantasies which usually concentrate on only one or two competing political entities.<br />The cast of characters is equally rich, almost too much so, as there are some characters given a fair amount of development space but in the end do not really contribute to advancing the plot or other character's development, leaving me wondering just why the character was there at all. But of those characters that are relevant, Kay draws some fine portraits, most of which are very engaging, or allow for appropriate villainous boos.<br />But there is one character that I had a large problem with, that of Brandin himself. While described as a tyrant, a man who would impose such a harsh penalty on Tigana and impose a life of exile on himself to carry out the spell, his actual portrayed character is of an intelligent, educated, very loving man, a capable and fair administrator, who uses his ability for sorcery with care, who keeps his ambitions reasonable and under control. This dichotomy strained my belief in him and in the entire underlying scenario the novel is based on.<br />Kay's prose tends towards the florid, and he occasionally lets his words run away from him, leading to over-description of some items in near-purple prose. He also included several scenes, sometimes nearly whole chapters, that were pretty much unnecessary, did little to advance the plot, and slowed down the pace of the book. Given both of these problems, I think the book could have used some judicious editorial pruning.<br />A fine, original fantasy idea, an excellent setting and appropriately complicated plot, but stretched out with too many words and with a basic problem in character.cter is of an intelligent, educated, very loving man, a capable and fair administrator, who uses his ability for sorcery with care, who keeps his ambitions reasonable and under control.

US	51152905	RJJKP3Q9USHBB	0812555171	647047632	Expiration Date	Books	2	13	19	N	N	Ghostly Thin Entertainment	I normally can read a novel of this length in a couple of days. This one took me ten to finish. When this happens, it indicates one of two things: either the book is an extremely complex, difficult read or it simply did not engage me as a reader, did not make me want to hurry back to its pages. And for this book, both reasons apply.<br />The story line itself is a very convoluted mating of urban ghosts, two rather well known historical figures, and a large set of major characters who are apparently unrelated to each other at the beginning but who eventually are all intertwined. The driving force behind the plot is the idea that ghosts can be captured, bottled, and inhaled by the living, imparting their memories and life essence to the inhaler. Certain people have become addicted to this habit, and will do anything to capture a really strong ghost, murder being almost the least of that 'anything'. Into this idea Powers drops the ghost of Thomas Edison, a man almost reverentially talked about in schools for his multitudinous inventions, but not exactly the nicest man in the world, as a really powerful ghost that everyone who is capable of sensing his presence wants to get.<br />The set of ideas that Powers introduces here is impressive: inhaleable ghosts, 'rotten' ghosts that once inhaled make it impossible to inhale more ghosts, the possibility of a freshly dead person's ghost continuing to use his body, ghosts who slowly obtain a substantial physical form by ingesting trash, an ingested ghost's personality may take over the consciousness of the inhaler, and many more. None of these ideas are directly laid out at the beginning of the book, but slowly become obvious as you proceed through the story - but while you are learning Powers' ghost rules, you are likely to feel somewhat confused.<br />Also impressive are the portraits Powers paints of Edison and Houdini, combining known historical facts and foibles of their characters with his story line in an almost seamless mix. His descriptions of Los Angeles, both past and present, add to the sense of realism that is so necessary for a book of this nature to succeed.<br />The large set of characters, though, is the major problem with this book. While Pete Sullivan, Angelica Elizalde, and Koot Hoomie Parganas, the three major point-of-view characters, are each described with enough detail about their past and their current thought patterns to enable me to recognize them as real people. What they failed to do was emotionally engage me. And this same problem applied to Solomon Shadroe, Sherman Oaks, Neal Obstadt and all the other characters here - I could not find myself caring what happened to all of them. Perhaps this is because for a large portion of the book, there does not seem to be any definite goal that these characters are trying to reach - a real plot direction doesn't emerge until almost two thirds of the way through the book. While this is certainly a common trait in the modern 'life realistic' novel, where things 'just happen' and people bounce from one experience to another with no goal or direction, here it hurts, as the point is not to paint reality but to present the fantastic as commonplace.<br />This also points up the fact that there is almost no deeper level of meaning to this book. The actions and events portrayed do not have any relevance to everyday living, nor are the character's reactions explored in enough depth to provide new insight into the human condition. This leaves the book as an 'entertainment' only type story, which is perfectly fine as an objective for a novel, but without strong reader engagement with the characters or a strong plot, the entertainment level does not tip the meter very far into the 'enjoyable' range.<br />Some great ideas, some impressive historical research, but stretched across too nebulous a plot from too many viewpoints to be a real page-turning grabber.mix.

There is no action. There is little explication of his earlier life. There are a large number of very facile remarks about the culture, the economy, the generation gap, political non-competence, about the true rulers of the world.  And we are treated to the first cornerstone of Rushdie's theme, Solanka's uncontrolled personal fury, striking out at himself and innocent by-standers.<br />If this was all there was to the book, yet another look at a marginally psychotic, conflicted individual, it really wouldn't have been worth reading.  Rushdie is too good a writer to fall into that trap, however, and having gotten in his licks at the American culture as he sees it, the real story can now begin. Starting with a rather unusual affair with the queen of a group gen-Xers, we are treated to an exploration of the mental effects of incest and gather some additional insight into the items that helped formed Solanka's character and his current problems. Unfortunately, incest is treated here as an absolute evil, with no exploration of alternative cultural modalities and relative levels of sin, things which would have improved the point of this section. As an outgrowth of this affair, the Professor is inspired to start a new project, and interactive web-based science fiction story.<br />As a story-within-a-story, this is no better than grade B pulp from the fifties. As an allegory for later events in the book and as another model for his theme, it serves a significant purpose, and it is quite believable that such a story would become immensely popular, putting the Professor back in the limelight and in contact with people from his earlier life.  Here we finally get to look at the whole man, and even if it is not a very pretty picture, it is at least comprehensible.<br />The last section of the book is yet another level of allegory, forcefully stating in yet one more way Rushdie's theme of fury being the driving force behind creativity, murder, heroes and cowards, world domination and the battle of the sexes.<br />Rushdie peppers his prose with multiple literary, personality, and event references. While most of the time such references add to the content and ambience of the story, there are places here where I felt it was overdone, to where I felt that Rushdie was showing off, rather than trying to advance or add to the story. Characterization for anyone except Solanka is very sketchy, and occasionally there are characters introduced, given a fair amount of development space, and then effectively dropped from the story.<br />The various levels of story and allegory bounce against each other, giving more depth to this book than would otherwise have been present, but at the same time I found most of it too obvious, on par with Rushdie's too easy observations and criticisms of American culture, with a net feeling of skating on a lake, thinking the ice is all there is, when the real depth is there below your feet, if you could just get to it.  As it is, this story's potential excellence remains locked below the ice, and we are left with the mild entertainment of skating in circles and figure-eights.icant purpose, and it is quite believable that such a story would become immensely popular, putting the Professor back in the limelight and in contact with people from his earlier life.

But if you're a writer of science fiction, where the environment is necessarily something different from the everyday world of now, how can you do this? For those who have read Heinlein's fiction, this book will provide some insights into just how this feat is accomplished. Within these pages you will find the genesis of:<br />The detailed space-suits of Have Spacesuit, Will Travel from his period of engineering research work on high altitude pressure suits during WWII.<br />How to build plumbing, bomb shelters, and move boulders from his work on his Colorado Springs house (Farnham's Freehold).<br />The marvelous characters of the cats that appeared in Door into Summer and The Cat Who Walks Through Walls from the cats that at various times in his life were co-owners of his habitats.<br />The knowledge of fencing so evident in Glory Road from his time on the fencing team at Annapolis, and the entire cadet experience that became part of the 'Lazy Man' episode of Time Enough for Love.<br />These are just a few of the examples of where incidents in Heinlein's life became part of his fiction, giving it that 'true to life' feel so common in his works and so rarely found in other SF writers of his generation. But this book is not a well laid out autobiography, but rather a collection of his letters to various people, mainly his literary agent, and often the items described above are included as an aside to the main subject of the letters.<br />Most of the material concerns itself with the details of how each of his stories was generated, the arguments he had with various editors (especially a certain one at Scribners), his working habits and the problems that prevented him from working at various times. For the Heinlein scholar or fan, this is a gold mine, providing much insight into almost all of his work. And Heinlein's own character shines through these letters, a proud, patriotic, self-disciplined, stubborn, highly opinionated, occasionally abrasive man who knew the worth of his labor and his effect on literally millions of his readers.<br />The letters are organized by theme (Beginnings, Juvenile Novels, Adult Novels, Travel, Fan Mail, Building, etc) and this easily allows the reader to see the progression of ideas and events within each of these subjects. But it has a downside in that items referenced in, say, the Building section have direct impacts on his writing schedule for a book covered in the Juvenile Novels section. Sometimes these relationships, while important, are not obvious to the reader due to this structure. After reading this book twice, and seeing just how much this type of thing occurs, I think I would have preferred having the letters organized in pure chronological order.<br />This is not a book for someone who has not read at least a few of Heinlein's fiction works, as the material will hold little interest other than some points on how the publishing industry works and just how this particular writer worked (which is not the writing class recommended method). But for those who, like myself, have read all or most of his works, this book can add a richness of background to his fiction works, a sense of 'growing closer' to the man who many call the greatest writer of science fiction, ever.ly opinionated, occasionally abrasive man who knew the worth of his labor and his effect on literally millions of his readers.<br />The letters are organized by theme (Beginnings, Juvenile Novels, Adult Novels, Travel, Fan Mail, Building, etc) and this easily allows the reader to see the progression of ideas and events within each of these subjects.

Most of the story is a detailing of  the events during their journey on the spaceship and the sights, people, and society of Venus, as carefully recorded in Poddy's diary (with occasional inserts by Clark).  This method of telling a story is difficult to do effectively, but for the most part it comes across very well in this book.<br />Poddy is a very likeable, friendly person who is, unfortunately, a little too naïve, a little too cute, a little too much preoccupied  with babies, boys, and proving herself to be `just as good as a man' to be quite believable as a (supposedly) highly intelligent but otherwise normal teen-age girl.  Clark, on the other hand, is all too believable as a boy with adult knowledge and a child's `me' centered view of the universe. Clark is the prime mover of the events, but for the most part he remains offstage, and we only learn about what he has done as filtered by Poddy's perceptions.  Clearly the most interesting character in the book, his actions, mistakes, and emotional development fit well with the thematic line that Heinlein is presenting, on the responsibilities of  parenting, an individual's own responsibility for his actions regardless of external factors, on the importance of one's relations and duties to others.<br />Along the way, Heinlein does his typical excellent job of describing the scientific aspects of space flight and navigation in a manner that consistently remains interesting, comprehensible, and accurate. Also part of the Heinlein territory are his comments on population control, gambling, unfettered capitalism, the art of politics, racial prejudice, the attitudes of the `moneyed' class towards their `inferiors', and prostitution  - an item that would never have gotten by his editor at Scribners.<br />The ending of this book has caused a fair amount of controversy. At the insistence of his publisher, Heinlein was forced to change his original ending to one that was far less traumatic, an `all ends well' type ending, as this was, after all, a 'children's book'. In so doing, however, the thematic line and Clark's development do not reach full closure. This edition of the book has both Heinlein's original ending and the changed ending, along with multiple essays and comments from readers about the pros and cons of each ending. For my money, Heinlein's original ending is considerably better, even though it probably makes the book unsuitable for very young readers, dealing with the consequences of actions, death, and the harshness of the universe towards stupidity, but the average teenager should have not only have no problem with it, I think they will find it more believable, more true to life.<br />Not his best, but certainly eminently readable and enjoyable by both teens and adults, and still better than ninety percent of all the other material on the racks.aspects of space flight and navigation in a manner that consistently remains interesting, comprehensible, and accurate.

Renting an old farmhouse as a storefront, she begins establishing a business selling her artistic pottery creations. Ronnie is an independent minded woman, not liking to be dependent on another or having her decisions made for her, so when her neighbor and landlord Dave arrives to look both her and her store over, the first seeds of antagonism are placed, even though there is an obvious attraction between the two. Dave is CEO and president of a large discount store business, has a certain amount of typical male arrogance, and a little bit of a blind spot in understanding why Ronnie reacts so sharply to any business suggestions he makes. The errors and misunderstandings between the two form the basis for the lasting conflict between the two even as their romantic feelings for each other grow.  How the conflict is resolved is quite predictable, but nevertheless very satisfying.<br />Appel does a very good job of making both Ronnie and Dave very believable (and very likeable) people, a prime requisite for any novel of romance. Her descriptions of the people of the small town and her quiet development of the events along the courtship road are nicely done, allowing the reader to sit back and just enjoy this simple story.  Appel's prose style is very straightforward, with good but not overpowering descriptions and dialogue that matches her characters.<br />Perhaps it would have added some additional scope to the work if we had seen Dave in his business mode rather than see only his home-town and courting face (though you see intimations of it in his courting planning). I think it would have added a level of complexity and abrasion to the dynamics between him and Ronnie that would have made the story a little richer.<br />Not earth-shaking, but a very competently told story good for some relaxing entertainment.	2002-06-24

There is very little magic in this book; rather what we have is a very fine delineation of everyday living in a world where things do not always go right, where the rape, burning, and near murder of a child, while not an ordinary occurrence, is part of the way things are.<br />Tenar, who we first met in book two, The Tombs of Atuan, is the point of view character of this book, a now middle-aged woman who has settled down to an ordinary life as a farmer&#8217;s wife, whose days have become a matter of routine, where magic, mages, and kings are merely fond memories. But her husband is now dead, she has &#8216;adopted&#8217; the poor abused child Therra mentioned above, and change comes in the form of a message that Origon, Ged&#8217;s teacher and master mage of Gont island, is dying. From here we follow Tenar&#8217;s attempts to forge just what her place in life is, accompanied by a now magic-less Ged, in terms of both everyday living and the place of women within the power structure of mages and kings.<br />There is a very definite turning in this book towards feminist themes, at times almost stridently so, in sharp contrast to the male-dominated earlier books. Tenar comes to question the right of any man to order her life, while at the same time recognizing that there is an incompleteness to her life without a complementary man to live it with. Issues of home, hearth, and children&#8217;s education (embodied by the physically and emotionally scarred Therra) are of prime importance here. All this makes for a very gritty, real-world feel to this book, certainly far away from fairy-tale land. Those who loved the earlier books may find this too much of a change, but I found that for myself, this book makes a great counter-point to those books, providing the whole with a balance that is perfectly in key with the general philosophy of Earthsea, that all things must be kept in balance. At the same time, this is not a book for younger children, as the themes and events are too dark, violent, and rife with heavy emotional freighting. Older teens can probably derive much from this book, with Tenar as a strong female role model and coping with loss and tragedy are so well presented.<br />Le Guin&#8217;s prose style is still the simple, minimalist structure that we have grown so used to over the years, a fine vehicle for presenting difficult concepts in easily digestible thought flavors. Things are never over-described, but rather left with a certain amount of incompleteness that allows the reader to add his own mental picture.<br />Very different from the first three books, but with its own power to capture your imagination, and with much to say about the everyday world where bad things must be met, handled, and then continue on with your life.must be kept in balance.

The field of military science fiction is a very limited one, with only a very few excellent examples, mainly Heinlein's Starship Troopers, Haldeman's Forever War, and Dickson's Soldier, Ask Not. Armor attempts to meld some of the great characteristics of these works, from Heinlein's powered armor to Haldeman's anti-war message, but it is only partially successful.<br />The first section of this book deals with Felix, a new recruit on his first battle drop. We are not given any background to this man, but is rather a blank slate that we watch as he and his powered armor scout suit turn into an impossibly efficient killing machine, becoming the sole survivor of his battle group after being faced with an opposition of literally thousands of human-sized Ants.  We see a man of action and few words, whose interior mental state is oddly split between the fighting, survive at all costs, totally unemotional `Engine' and a terrified, confused, and very fatalistic `other'. When the 'Engine' is not in command, we see Felix have some interaction with other soldiers on the drop, from finding out what the survival percentage is for scouts on their first, second, etc major drop from some experienced veterans, to who their military idol is, a man named Kent, supposedly impossible to defeat in hand-to-hand suit combat, and a quickly burgeoning love interest in a extremely capable scout from another battle group.  This is the best section of the book, as we see by their actions what molds a military group together, what values soldiers must have if they are to survive as a group, how emotions become a riotous tangle under the demands of battle.<br />Abruptly, the book leaves Felix and picks up a new character, Jack Crow, cynical, worldly, known for impossible (and marginally illegal) exploits, fighting his way out of a prison and onto a mutineer space ship run by master pirate Borglyn. When Borglyn presents a plan to refuel his ship at a Fleet science base on the planet Sanctity, owned by the eccentric alcoholic Lewis, and offers as prize to Crow a beautiful little ship and a de-activated scout suit for defeating the science base defenses from the inside, all the pieces are in place. From this point on (about page 130) I found the book to be totally predictable, from just who Felix and Lewis really are, to what actions each character would take leading to the final battle.<br />The characterization of Crow is not very well done, as we are only given hints of his past, a rather murky inside look at his emotional triggers and defenses, and a constant mannerism of lighting a cigarette at every available opportunity, mention of which I found quite irritating after the thirteenth repetition. Unlike Felix, whose past must remain a blank for several reasons, Crow's past should have had far greater explication to make us really believe in him as a person, to where his final actions would be more believable and not just a predictable stereotype. Roger Zelazny was known for building characters like Crow in works like This Immortal, but Zelazny's were believable, three dimensional people. Crow is not. This is unfortunate, as the characters of Crow, Felix, Kent, and Holly (the scientist in charge of the Sanctity base, and also very much a stereotype) form a group of different looks at just what it is that makes a hero, which is really Steakley's theme.<br />As a theme, it is distinct from the earlier cited works, and could have made this work into something excellent. But it is marred by several additional factors:<br />1. The shown high level military strategy/personnel are absurd. Any military consistently run in this fashion would quickly lose all respect by the lower level soldiers. The 'grunts' are famous for always bitching about just how screwed up the 'brass' are, but if they truly believed that, you would see Russia in 1917 all over again.<br />2. The Ants are equally impossible, seeming to have only one strategy, overwhelm through sheer mindless force of numbers, though they are supposedly a technologically advanced, star travelling culture. This attribute could have been worked into a strong sub-theme, but it wasn't.<br />3. The human society outside of the military is never really shown, nor is there really any reason given for the Ant War itself.<br />Thus the hero theme is forced to exist in an almost total vacuum from the normal societal factors that help define just what a hero is. And without strong character definition, it just didn't carry the emotional freighting that would have made this an excellent work.<br />Read this one for the opening highly action oriented first section, which is excellent.

But Norton took these common elements and added her own special flavor, and the result is a very satisfying adventure that truly qualifies as 'real' science fiction, one that will tickle that 'sense of wonder' that is such a prime requisite for imaginative fiction.<br />In the waning days of a vast interstellar empire, a lone ship of the Patrol crash lands on a minor, very out of the way planet. Quickly scouting around their crash site, they find evidence of a long vanished high tech civilization in the Sealed Cities, along with nomadic hunter-gatherer level groups of humans. Looking for better shelter to tend their injured personnel, the rangers enter one of the cities, only to find it occupied by another group of refugees and ruled by the Acturian Cummi, a master telepath, one who is not above overpowering and directly controlling other peoples minds, who is bent on becoming the sole ruler of the planet. Zinga, a member of the ancient historian race of Zacathans (a reptilian race that populates many of Norton's science fiction works), and the human Kartr, both high order telepaths themselves, though not of the strength of Cummi, end up in a memorable mental battle with Cummi. The result of this battle and its aftermath lead to a very surprising and exciting ending, one that has resonated in my mind for forty years.<br />Norton's work with the telepath aspect was unusual at the time of this book's writing (1953), showing measurable grading of telepathic ability, the dirty, nasty possibilities that such a talent engenders, the intriguing invention of the Can-hound as an android built for external mental control, and the indication that telepaths would not automatically form a society onto themselves, but might still be the object of unreasonable prejudice. She also strikes an accurate note in her depictions of the traditions and customs of the Patrol and the alienation that outsiders to that heritage can be made to feel. Her characterizations of Kartr and Zinga, while not excessively deep, are more than adequate to allow the reader to become engrossed in their problems and actions.<br />A grand adventure yarn, with more than a bit of meaning, depth, and moral injunctions hiding behind the fast pace.

She also strikes an accurate note in her depictions of the traditions and customs of the Patrol and the alienation that outsiders to that heritage can be made to feel.

Heinlein did not write very many fantasy works, but when he did, the result was usually a rather different and fun romp. Glory Road is probably his best work in this genre, and it makes most other sword-and-sorcery stories pale in comparison.<br />Oscar, our hero, is a Vietnam veteran idling away his time on the Isle du Levant, a small island off the coast of France known for its lack of haute couture (or clothing of any style), when his eye is caught by the most beautiful woman he has ever seen, sleekly muscled and with regal bearing.  When she offers him a job with `great adventure and great risk' he blindly accepts, little realizing just what an incredible jaunt he has let himself in for.  A journey that will travel through some of the 20 universes that Star is Empress of, on a quest to retrieve the stolen Great Egg. Along the way you will be treated to a sword/bow and arrow fight with a very real set of dragons (with a rather amusing fight strategy), a hand to hand fight with a very dirty (and smelly) giant, pentagrams and spells for magical flight. All of the incidents along this trip are treated with a fair dollop of humor and satire (and at least a partial parody of other sword & sorcery epics such as Conan the Barbarian), while at the same time Heinlein manages to present some pseudo-scientific explanations for the `magical' incidents, something he did in just about all of his fantasy works, so that it is somewhat problematic to call this a `fantasy'.<br />The climatic sword battle with the `Eater of Souls' is very different from the standard hack-and-slash portrayal of sword fights in all too many movies and novels.  Heinlein was a member of the fencing team during his time at Annapolis (for some possible reasons for why he took up this sport, see the \\"Lazy Man\\" portion of Time Enough for Love), and this experience and knowledge is directly transposed to the battle descriptions of this book, making for a very fascinating and exciting read.<br />But there is more to this book than just a fun trip down the yellow brick road of swash-buckling heroes and dragons. Oscar is not your typical mighty-thewed simple-minded adventurer, but is rather a man who thinks about his actions, who has a strong sense of moral responsibility, who can (at least intellectually) comprehend that customs change with different cultures, a true hero who understands the need for noblesse oblige. Nor is Star a simpering damsel-in-distress, but rather a hard, practical, self-reliant, intelligent and rather commanding woman. The interaction between these two strong characters forms the starting point for Heinlein's exploration of how relations between the sexes is defined by cultural biases and expectations, the individual's own sense of self-worth, the ability to communicate and compromise, and the problems that married couples face. This philosophical type of discourse occupies a good portion of the last third of the novel, and may not seem at first glance to be well integrated with the first two-third's emphasis on action.  But on reflection, the last third forms the completion of the thematic structure of the work, whose groundwork is well laid in the first portion, and provides a level of meaning that is not common in fantasy works.<br />Of course, this being a Heinlein novel, expect to find some sharp remarks about the IRS and taxes, how to fight (and not fight) a war, status symbols, horse racing and lotteries, laws about carrying greater than six inch blades in public, veteran's benefits, Congressional methods of making laws, the bizarre workings of  military organizations, the relative strengths and weaknesses of democracy versus monarchies and feudal structures, and under-the-table tactics for motivating an individual.  As always, Heinlein will make you think about and question your own opinions and assumptions on these things, even if you don't agree with his expressed viewpoint, as he always makes his viewpoint at least sound logical and correct.<br />Read this one for the fun and humor. Then let it soak in and expand your sense of the possible, the correct, the moral, and the reason for living.correct.<br />Read this one for the fun and humor.

US	51152905	R1CIJIEY3IL677	0451452615	511955488	Bored of the Rings: A Parody of J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings	Books	4	14	15	N	Y	Narcs on Pigs!	Need a little break from all the horrid seriousness of the day? Then this marvelously inventive parody should hit just the spot. From the hilarious twisted names of Dildo and Frito Bugger, Goodgulf the wizard, Gimlet the dwarf and Legolam the elf to the equally twisted representations of the Boggies in the Sty and the Riders of Roi-Tan and their merino sheep, to the exacting depiction of college life of the Forward, each page will bring a smile, a chuckle, and an outright belly-laugh.<br />I read Lord of the Rings when it was first published in paperback in 1965, and like many others fell totally in love with Tolkien's marvelous sense of language and incredibly detailed world building. When Bored of the Rings came out in 1969, I immediately grabbed it, as I grabbed everything else remotely dealing with Middle Earth.  My shekels were well spent in this case, and I always remember some of these perverted alternative scenes whenever I re-read the original. This book follows the plot line of the original very closely, boiling down the original 1200 pages to this book's 150 and managing to cover every major scene, which is quite a feat.<br />Clearly though, as a parody, this book is not a stand-alone. Much of its humor derives from the reader's knowledge of the original. It also helps if you're old enough to remember some of the television commercials of the sixties, as otherwise some of the references in this book will pass over your head. There are also some pokes at certain Presidents, TV series, movies, cultural icons, and the hippie and drug-laced counter-culture of the day.<br />Like many good things, this book is best devoured in small bites, a few pages a day, stopping before your humor-detector collapses from over-stimulation. A great way to relax for a few minutes at the end of the day.	2002-06-02
US	51152905	R2OMO9V9VLUG9O	0312866151	697303352	Where Late The Sweet Birds Sang: A Novel	Books	4	45	48	N	Y	The One Against the Many	Much of this world's history has been shaped by the constant attempts to shift the balance between the individual as an autonomous, self-directing, self-centered, and unique unit and the group society, where everyone's efforts go towards the general welfare, where the individual is merely a replaceable cog. This book takes this battle to the extreme, to where, via cloning, there really are no individuals, only copies, where anyone who disturbs the group is subject to extreme measures, from execution to severe behavioral/mind control to expulsion to the wilderness. True individuals come to be considered 'defective', as they cannot always accept the wishes of the group, they keep coming up with disturbingly new and different ideas, and they place themselves ahead of the group.<br /><br />To bring about this society, Wilhelm starts with a fairly normal (for science fiction) scenario: due to man's constant pollution of the environment, new diseases appear, eventually either directly killing everyone (and almost all the land animal life also) or rendering them sterile. One group sees a way to save humanity by using cloning techniques, with some promise that after enough generations of cloning, some sexual reproductive capability will reappear.<br /><br />From this starting point, the book is told in three distinct parts. The first section covers the period when the cloning facilities are being set up against a background of a world society in the throes of collapse. Part two is a look after several clone generations have occurred and an expedition is made to one of ruined cities to salvage needed high-tech supplies for the continuing cloning operation. The expedition exposes both the strength and the weakness of the clone groups, as they find it almost impossible to remain sane when separated from their clone 'brothers' and 'sisters'. One expedition member, Molly, grows so far away from her sisters under the stress that she really becomes an individual. Part three covers the final battle between clones and individuals, as Molly's son Mark grows up as the only 'single' in the group.<br /><br /> Thematically, this book is tautly conceived and executed. The later generations of the clones exemplify the problems of extreme homogeneity, as they find themselves, though extremely intelligent and quick learners, incapable of creative thought and independent action. The down sides of the individual are also exposed, showing the limitations on what one person can do when separated from the group. All of this is displayed pretty much by the character's actions, though there is some exposition via council meetings that are more philosophical statements than planning sessions.<br /><br />Character development is reasonable, given that most of the clones must remain essentially 'faceless' and the time span covered means that no character lasts more than a third of the book. But this also means that no character is explored in extreme depth, which makes it hard for the reader to become emotionally attached to anyone.<br /><br />Scientifically, there are problems with this book. An ecology is an extremely complex intertwined entity. When all the land animals die off (including, by specific mention, bees), there will be large affects on the plant population. Many plants can't reproduce at all without the help of certain animal species. The grasses, without a large group of herbivores to keep them in check, would very likely choke out many other plant species. Pollination becomes extremely problematic without bees. Wilhelm attempts to get around this by stating that function is taken over by ants, which would be at best much less efficient than that which occurs with bees. But Wilhelm shows none of these foreseeable affects - the forests and grain fields continue to grow apparently undisturbed. None of these problems directly affects the theme of this book, but it bothered my suspension of disbelief, especially as it was only necessary to kill off all the people, she could have left the animals alone, to get the situation she needed.<br /><br />This book took the 1977 Hugo Award, and as well told exposition of one the major philosophical battles that man faces today and in the future, it deserved it. But it is a definite 'thinking' book, not one of action, grand drama, or deep psychology. Expect to do some internal reflection when you finish this book, and see how you stack up as an individual versus your place in and responsibilities to your surrounding society.the animals alone, to get the situation she needed.

This book begins in very typical Zelazny fashion, introducing us to the world of literal demons, mainly drawn from Chinese legends. And the introduction will grab you; its setting and concept are very well drawn and captivating.<br />The story is told from the point of view of Kai Wren, also known as Lord Demon and the Godslayer, so named as the only demon to ever defeat a god in their long running war. But as we meet him, we find an artisan and something of a hermit, who has spent the last 120 years designing and fashioning a magical bottle, who has feelings for his human servant (something demons aren't supposed to have). When his servant is murdered by some scrub demons during a routine run to Earth for pizza, Kai is galvanized to action, first to obtain revenge on the perpetrators, and later, as just who the real brains behind the murder becomes more and more of a puzzle, he finds himself working as an investigator, slowly developing friendships with other humans and demons as he gathers information.<br />If the starting scenario had been consistently carried through the entire book, this might have been a very good novel. Unfortunately, after about page 70 or so, it deteriorates into very ordinary developments, as the demons are more and more portrayed as having very human qualities and vices and several rather pointless additions are made to the initial idea. The old idea of alternate universes accessed by 'gates' becomes one of the main plot movers (even if a couple of these universes are populated by hangers and socks its still not very original), most of the 'gods' are only sketchily drawn and seem remarkably weak to be gods, and most of the 'puzzle' the average reader will figure out long before Kai Wren does. The final battle is certainly not Zelazny in his prime, as it is a complete cop-out, a retreat to 'this is fantasy, anything goes', and will severely disappoint the reader.<br />I don't know whether the above problems are those of Zelazny not having time before his death to completely flesh out his story idea and correct perceived problems or are those of having the novel completed by Jane Lindskold with her own ideas that don't mesh very well with Zelazny's original concept. But the net result, while still very readable and good for some mild entertainment, does not compare to the marvelous tales an earlier Zelazny gave us, from Lord of Light and This Immortal to Jack of Shadows.rage reader will figure out long before Kai Wren does.

This book is one of the best of that period, an excellent adventure that anyone of any age can enjoy.<br />Hosteen Storm is the Beast Master, a mustered out soldier after the end of Xik war, who has managed to keep his military team of animals together - two meercats, Hing and Ho, an eagle, Baku, and a sand cat, Surra, genetically enhanced animals that Storm has a strong empathic and near telepathic bond with. Arriving on the planet Arzor that he chose as probably best for a man who prefers outdoor living, that will provide him employment opportunities for himself and his team, he quickly adds one more member to his team, a rugged, quick footed horse he names Rain-on-Dust. Hired on to help herd the native equivalent of cattle, he makes friends with the local native intelligent race, the Norbies, a people whose anatomy precludes their being able to talk and have therefore developed sign language to an art, whose culture in many ways mimics that of Storm's early life.  Storm's heritage is that of the Dineh (Navajo),  a name which simply means `The People' in their own language, and he was partially raised by his medicine-man grandfather, a heritage he clings to, as Earth has been destroyed by the Xiks in one of the last acts of the war.<br />This is the background beginning to Storm's search for new home, one that respects his heritage and can use his talents, with a buried unsatisfied anger at the Xiks, a festering grudge against a man named Quade, and a conflicted self image. As he travels through this new planet, events lead to his discovery of a buried city of the Old Ones, a race that traveled the star-lanes long before man (note that this long vanished race appears in many of Norton's books of this period), and to discoveries and actions that will eventually help heal his hurts and provide him with a more complete, mature image of himself and the world around him.<br />As the above indicates, character development is quite strong in this book, applying not just to Storm but also to his animals and his Norbie friends. Also strongly in evidence is Norton's excellent look at the Native American culture, something she developed in several books and obviously cared deeply about. The story line itself is fast paced, with plenty of action, and will make you greedily keep turning pages, till you unhappily turn the last one, and realize there is no more to enjoy. Though much of Norton's prose is fairly prosaic, there is sheer magic in her bits-and-pieces revelations about the Old Ones, a magic that will fire your imagination and enter your dreams.<br />Thematically this book has much to say about prejudice, honor and friendship, the importance of roots, courage and self-image, and the validity of alternate cultures, all quietly slipped in amongst all the action.<br />This work bears almost no relation the movie of the same name, though it was supposedly based on this book.. About all the movie kept was the concept of the animal team - the rest of the plot and setting was totally changed, and in doing so completely lost the power of this story. I believe Ms. Norton had her name removed from the movie credits, quite rightly not wanting to be associated with such a poor, mangled 'interpretation' (if you could even dignify it as such) of one of her finest works. Try this book, give it to your sons and daughters, loan it to your friends - this is one of those books that the term `sense of wonder' was invented to describe.himself and the world around him.<br />As the above indicates, character development is quite strong in this book, applying not just to Storm but also to his animals and his Norbie friends.

The Hippae and their associated Hounds are the type of thing that can give you nightmares, an enlarged, horrific parody of horses, capable of mentally controlling those around them, with a totally egocentric and blood-thirsty attitude. And the human society that has formed around the Hippae is also intriguing, somewhat modeled on the South American estancias, but with a strong English manor element, as the humans use the Hippae as mounts for the Hunt, a direct parody of the sport of fox hunting, with the object of the Hunt being the Foxen, a creature never really seen in its entirety, but only glimpsed from the corners of the eyes. The ecology and relationships of the various species of the planet form the major scientific underpinnings of this novel, relationships that are somewhat surprising and very interesting.<br /><br />Into this world come Marjorie Westriding, her husband Rigo, her children Stella and Tony, Rigo's mistress Eugenie, and the family Catholic priests, sent as ambassadors from Sanctity, the controlling religious body on Earth, to investigate why Grass is the only known planet that does not seem to be infected with a fatal plague that is slowly wiping out humanity.  The novel's action is driven by the consequences of the family learning about the strange social structures and alien life forms of the planet.<br /><br />While Marjorie, the main character, is fairly well drawn with a fair amount of depth, most of the other characters are very much stick figures that are supporting spear carriers only. This is a pity, as Rigo, Stella, and the dom Sylvan show intimations of being intriguing people, but they are never portrayed in enough depth to make them come alive. The total cast of characters is fairly large, and at later stages in the book it becomes difficult to remember just who each one is due to their limited portrayal.<br /><br />Grass is at least partially an investigation of religion, faith, and original sin for both humans and for two different alien races. As such, it invites some comparison with other science fiction works that have dealt with these themes - Walter M. Miller, Jr.'s A Canticle for Leibowitz, Orson Scott Card's Speaker for the Dead, and the one closest in theme to this, James Blish's A Case of Conscience.  Unfortunately, Grass does not meet the high level shown by these other books, as the crisis of faith experienced by Marjorie and the Foxen is dealt with somewhat shallowly. There is little deep explication of the problems, ambiguities, and paradoxes that entail from the concept of original sin applying to an alien race that were so well investigated by Blish's work. Marjorie's own changing concept of God from the traditional Catholic picture to one where humans are mere instruments of God's will, a virus that He unleashed to perform a specific action, where individual humans are not known by name to God, is a better formed and portrayed concept, but still not at the depth and emotional level that Canticle for Leibowitz achieved.<br /><br />This is an ambitious work, with many sub-themes twined around the main one, each of which is deserving of in-depth portrayal. As written, this book is just too short to do justice to either the sub-themes or the main theme, not to mention the need for greater character development.  It probably should have been twice its current length to fully develop all of the richness of ideas that Tepper presents here.

Set in the very far future, so far that many main sequence stars have started to die, this is a story of two very different paths that two different groups of humans have taken to the puzzle of existence and life. In the city of Diasper, we have a totally enclosed and static society, where people live for a thousand years, then store their memories for some later computer controlled reincarnation, where anything outside the city is not only totally ignored, its very existence is practically denied.  At the other extreme is Lys, where man is just one part of the world of living, growing things, where bio-engineering has been raised to such an art it is buried in the background, and humans have developed telepathic talents. These are the last two areas of civilization on an Earth that has otherwise become a desert, where even the oceans have totally dried up.<br /><br />Against this background we find Alvin, the first truly new citizen in Diasper in seven thousand years, born without any memories of prior existences, to whom, without any preset thought biases, all things are open to question.  When he starts to question the origin of Diasper and ask what exists outside the city, he is met with rebuff and ostracism. Persisting in his questions, he eventually finds a way to leave Diasper and travel to Lys. The things he learns there and the additional questions provoked by this knowledge eventually lead to things far beyond the Earth and a complete revision of 'known' history, with the fate of the galaxy hanging in the balance.<br /><br />While Alvin and the other characters are reasonably portrayed, this is not the strong suit of this book, nor will you find a great amount of 'hard' science gadgets and plot devices. This is rather a book that will make you think about the long term purpose of man and his place in the universe. There is a painted picture here of just what the ultimate end point is of pure technological development and the stifling effects such an environment has on people, strongly contrasted with an alternative development line focusing on human mental capabilities and its negatives.  Both thematic sides are held up beneath the strong lights of hope, pride, and ambition.<br /><br />There is a feeling of near poetry, a total 'sense of wonder', that pervades this book, a feeling that will captivate and invigorate the reader, that will take him far outside the everyday concerns of today. In certain areas, the great weight of not just millennia, but billions of years of history will press upon you, where the discovery of ages old items will be as much of an adventure as watching our first manned lunar mission.<br /><br />This book was a near total rewrite of  \\"Against the Fall of Night\\". While the basic scenario is the same between the two books, the endings are dramatically different, and actually present a different outlook on man's purpose and his part in the grander scheme of things. I have never been able to decide which of the two versions is better - but that just means you should read both, as they are both fully deserving of your time and attention.ust what the ultimate end point is of pure technological development and the stifling effects such an environment has on people, strongly contrasted with an alternative development line focusing on human mental capabilities and its negatives.

After his On the Beach and A Town Like Alice, the rest of his works are almost totally ignored by both the critics and the public, which is a pity as almost all of his works are finely written and have something worthwhile to say.<br /><br />Pastoral was written during WWII, and from a purely British viewpoint, unlike so many of the war books that were written long after the conflict by so many Americans.  As such there is a totally different atmosphere to this book, a quietness, an acceptance of the conditions and requirements of the war as just something that is there, part of the daily routine.  And it is within this atmosphere that Neville constructs a fine love story between the very experienced bomber pilot Peter Marshal (at age 22!) and a W.A.A.F signals officer, Gervase Robertson.<br /><br />As perhaps is typical for war-time love stories, the war itself provides the conflict, the friction between the lovers, as Peter is duty-bound to continue flying bombing missions, and Gervase believes her own duties are important to the course of the war, and should not be given up merely to get married.  Her decline of Peter's offer of marriage sends Peter into a mental tail-spin, seriously impacting his efficiency as a flyer.  How this conflict is resolved and the events that happen because of this conflict form the main portion of this book. Before reaching that point, however, we are treated to a view of English morality and customs of the day, a code that says one mustn't go off alone with a member of the opposite sex, that married woman are expected to keep house, not have jobs, where the woman must defer to the man. A view that might seem dreadfully stifling and old-fashioned to a reader of today's world, but it shown in such a non-obtrusive way that the reader can accept it without question. Until, that is, the reader finishes the book, and realizes that Neville has been quietly showing (and mildly satirizing) both the good and bad qualities of such a code. This is typical of Nevil's writing - his points are made far more by showing, rather than telling, always a mark of a fine writer. Also noteworthy is the attitude towards the war that is displayed by all the characters here - that death is an everyday happening, but it won't happen to me, it only happens to someone else. An attitude that seems to belong to every young person.<br /><br />Nevil's prose style tends towards the descriptive, especially of the countryside and everyday actions. His dialogue in this book is loaded with English slang, very typical of actual speech patterns of the day, but this does at times make it somewhat hard for the poor modern American reader to decode what is being said. And some of Nevil's expertise as an avionics engineer shows in his descriptions of the aircraft and the functioning of various parts of these machines, at times obviously assuming that reader knows more about aircraft than is normally the case.  These, however, are very minor negatives, almost totally subsumed by the engagement of the reader in the story of these two very well realized characters.<br /><br />One decided negative that has nothing to do with Nevil's writing ability is the production quality of the hardbound reprint edition. The typeface used is very close to an old typewriter font, with thin serifs and a fairly small point size, and the printing press seemed to have severe difficulty with maintaining an even ink flow - at places the print fades to near illegibility.  This all makes for a very rough impact on your eyes.  A pity that this fine work has such a botched job of production.<br /><br />Regardless of the quality of the printing, however, this book deserves a look, if nothing else just to see how a romance really should be written, as opposed to the material that passes for 'romance' on the book racks of today.bad qualities of such a code. This is typical of Nevil's writing - his points are made far more by showing, rather than telling, always a mark of a fine writer.

An attitude that seems to belong to every young person.     Nevil's prose style tends towards the descriptive, especially of the countryside and everyday actions. His dialogue in this book is loaded with English slang, very typical of actual speech patterns of the day, but this does at times make it somewhat hard for the poor modern American reader to decode what is being said. And some of Nevil's expertise as an avionics engineer shows in his descriptions of the aircraft and the functioning of various parts of these machines, at times obviously assuming that reader knows more about aircraft than is normally the case.  These, however, are very minor negatives, almost totally subsumed by the engagement of the reader in the story of these two very well realized characters.    One decided negative that has nothing to do with Nevil's writing ability is the production quality of the hardbound reprint edition. The typeface used is very close to an old typewriter font, with thin serifs and a fairly small point size, and the printing press seemed to have severe difficulty with maintaining an even ink flow - at places the print fades to near illegibility.  This all makes for a very rough impact on your eyes.  A pity that this fine work has such a botched job of production.    Regardless of the quality of the printing, however, this book deserves a look, if nothing else just to see how a romance really should be written, as opposed to the material that passes for 'romance' on the book racks of today.	2002-05-07

In addition, he felt that our schools did a very poor job of preparing young people for what life was all about. This book presented at least one partial solution to both problems: have a school course in survival, whose final test was to be dropped onto some unknown 'wilderness' planet for a week and forced to actually survive.  Around this basic concept Heinlein fashioned what is probably one of the best of his so-called 'juvenile' novels.<br /><br />Roderick Walker is the prime character, a young man with some doubts about whether he is really ready to take the final exam in this course.  With some encouragement and advice from his older sister, he decides to proceed, going through the 'gate' to a new world where nothing is familiar, where everything must be viewed as potentially deadly. But after managing to survive for the prescribed time, there is no pick up signal, no return gate, and Rod slowly comes to the conclusion that, regardless of what has gone wrong, he must make a go of really living long term on this new world. Along with other class survivors, a small society is formed, initially with Rod as the nominal leader.<br /><br />From this point, Heinlein manages to show the essentials of how and why a government is formed, what type of government make sense for a small group, how a society protects itself from 'bullies' (the only truly deadly animal is the two-legged variety), the contribution made by both sexes to a properly functioning society, just what makes a man a man, and the essential qualities of a leader. All buried within a fine adventure story of just how the little group builds itself from an unrelated bunch of people huddling in a cave to a bustling, forward looking industrious town, with excellent characterizations of not just Rod but most of the people around him, and with very little direct preaching, but rather showing his points as results of the events and actions of his characters.<br /><br />Heinlein's typical unforced, simple American prose style is much in evidence here, making both dialog and descriptions seem perfectly natural. This makes for a very fast reading experience, with a lot of his philosophical points sliding in under the reader's conscious radar, only to wake you up at 3AM with an 'Oh, yeah! That makes sense.' And perhaps you will come away from this book, as I did, thinking that the idea of a school course in survival is something that should actually be implemented.<br /><br />Everyone, from teens to adults, homemakers to rugged individualists, engineers to social workers, can enjoy this book. There are very few works that can appeal to such a wide range of audience as this one does, but this is something that Heinlein made a habit of. Written almost fifty years ago, it reads just as well, if not better than anything published today.round him, and with very little direct preaching, but rather showing his points as results of the events and actions of his characters.

Hawking has taken everything from the early history of thinking about the universe, its laws and composition, to the latest developments on black holes and string theory and placed it in a remarkably lucid set of explanations that detail the concepts behind all the mathematics that is so intimidating to most.  This book is written without a single equation or a single statement on the order of  &quot;From the above, it is obvious that...&quot; Instead, we proceed from the (comparatively) simple concepts about the everyday observable world of gravity, planets, and stars, travel carefully along the historical path of scientific observations as they modify and enhance the simple theories till we reach the world of quantum mechanics, the big bang, wormholes, and Grand Unified Field Theories. Each concept is fully explained, and with this expanded second edition, many of the concepts are beautifully illustrated with drawings and photographs.<br />And, possibly surprising to some people, as we enter the rarified air of today's theories, we see that the line between physics and philosophy is a very thin one, and ruminations about the origin of the Universe lead to discussions about God and fate. Here we see why Hawking is one of the premier physicists of today, as he obviously thinks in same kind of conceptual language that this book is written in, capable of looking at the meaning behind the mathematics and how it relates to us as humans.<br />Physics students and engineers may not find very much new here, but even they may benefit from the clear thought lines presented here, forcing a look at the meaning behind all the esoteric symbols that are their everyday working fare.<br />About the only quibble I had with this was Hawking's insistence on writing out very large/small numbers as million-million-million... While this was fine the first couple of times it becomes a little irritating in place of the standard 1,000,000... representation, or even better to use standard scientific notation.<br />A great elucidation of some of the most complex theories of the day, theories seemingly unrelated to your everyday life, but which are in fact the bedrock upon which today's technological marvels are based, and with implications that catch the nether regions of religion and the questions we all have about the meaning of life and the universe.couple of times it becomes a little irritating in place of the standard 1,000,000... representation, or even better to use standard scientific notation. <br />A great elucidation of some of the most complex theories of the day, theories seemingly unrelated to your everyday life, but which are in fact the bedrock upon which today's technological marvels are based, and with implications that catch the nether regions of religion and the questions we all have about the meaning of life and the universe.	2002-04-29

Based on the idea that there is just one individual properly suited to be Empress and one suited to be the Pretender to the throne, each individual is endlessly cloned and appropriately trained to fill their defined role. But in the latest triumph by the Pretender, Suu-Suu, one of the scientists charged with the keeping of the embryos of the Empress, flees to the forgotten colony world of Maya, long isolated from the Empire, taking the embryos with her. The world of Maya, ignorant of the happenings in the empire, has proceeded on its own development path, a colony world split into two factions of (nominally) normal humans and the Changed, people who have been genetically enhanced to interface with a computer AI. But all of this is just background, not really part of the main story line, a pity, I think, as the full development of this societal structure would have been extremely intriguing.<br />Against this background Lewitt places the story of Della, apparent member of the Changed who becomes infatuated with one of the 'lesser' humans, Arsen, and bears a child by him, Anselm.  Arsen becomes the leader of an abortive revolt against the Changed, protesting the human's treatment by the Changed and their abysmal living conditions.  When Arsen is executed for his part in the revolt, the stage is set for Della and her son to continue the fight, each in their own way.<br />During the course of their struggles, each of them journeys down a road of self-discovery, a slowly dawning awareness of the Empire and the role of Maya and the genetically enhanced humans in the larger picture. It is this journey that is main attraction of this book, leading Lewitt's characters and the reader into the realms of philosophical reality, personal identity, the influence of environment versus heredity, fate against free will, prejudice, and the influence of other's expectations on an individual's choice of actions.  Della and Anselm are both well drawn believable people, even if neither is the paragon of virtue.  However, most of the other characters are flat stick-figures, merely there as props for the action.<br />The story construction is somewhat odd, starting from Della's memoirs at the end of the revolution, changing in the middle to Anselm's point of view as the revolution is just beginning. This construction only partially works, as at times it allows the good use of foreshadowing, at others it spoils the suspense, leaving a certain level of confusion in its wake and leading to an odd, not-quite-there atmosphere.<br />The prose style is adequate, but at times more detailed descriptions of places and everyday happenings would have been helpful. I found myself floundering a couple of times trying to imagine a particular scene with too few signposts to direct me. The apparently complex structure of the Changed's society is merely hinted at, not fleshed out in great detail, so Della's position within and actions to control that society remain somewhat ambiguous and nebulous.<br />A very ambitious work, with potentially tremendous thematic concepts and ideas, enough for three books of this length, but not quite executed well enough to make the story vibrant and demanding.on an individual's choice of actions.

Windling mixes elements of Celtic myth, native American folklore, the rarified worlds of poetry and surrealistic painters with the desert setting of the area surrounding Tucson to create a well crafted work of slightly nebulous otherness, an evocation of the mystical, that will resonate with and absorb the reader.<br />Maggie Black, journalist and sometime poet, divorced but still somewhat in love with her high-profile musician husband, is the main character. Maggie inherits the property of Pulitzer prize winning poet David Cooper upon his mysterious death by drowning (in the desert!). With the idea of writing Cooper's biography, she goes to his home located in the hills above Tucson. Once there, she is slowly drawn into the rhythm of life in the desert, finding beauty in the landscape and the local people, and gradually finding new interpretations of Cooper's most famous poems collectively known as The Wood Wife. From this prosaic beginning, the story slowly adds elements of the fantastic, as Cooper's inspiration for the poems and his lover's surrealistically painted visions of the creatures that populate the area becomes evident.<br />Maggie's character is well portrayed, that of a somewhat insecure woman slowly finding her own self worth from behind the smothering light of her former husband, finding her own long-buried poetic voice, finding a way to deal with fantastic events and creatures while remaining a practical cosmopolitan woman of today's world. Cooper himself becomes a distinct voice, as we see many of the letters that he wrote when he first settled in the area and was drawn into the area's ambience. The characters of Johnny Foxxe and some of the magical creatures are not so well defined, in some cases merely sketched in for use as plot enhancers, and could have used some further development work.<br />The descriptive prose work is excellent - it is easy to get the feeling and mental picture of the area, people, and creatures, while at the same time things are not over-described, allowing the reader to fill in his own mental picture.<br />The eventual story climax is perhaps slightly disappointing, as it seemed to me to derive too many of its elements from fairly well known folk tales, and certain of those elements were really unnecessary, gratuitously added to fill out the story line. But this is a minor quibble to what is in general a very engrossing story that is quite different from the normal, well told, with a definite poetic air that is far above the typical fantasy work attempts at the evocation of faery. And there is a level of meaning beyond the straightforward story line, a fair amount of both psychology and the symbolic, that is also quite unusual in a fantasy work.<br />Recommended for anyone looking for something different from the standard everyday fare that fills the book racks to overflowing.ome further development work.<br />The descriptive prose work is excellent - it is easy to get the feeling and mental picture of the area, people, and creatures, while at the same time things are not over-described, allowing the reader to fill in his own mental picture. <br />The eventual story climax is perhaps slightly disappointing, as it seemed to me to derive too many of its elements from fairly well known folk tales, and certain of those elements were really unnecessary, gratuitously added to fill out the story line.

But his scathing social commentary of White Lotus and this book probably have not received the attention they deserve, perhaps because of the fantastic, science-fictional feel of their portrayed worlds.<br />Told strictly as the minutes of a state congressional hearing, this book details the events that follow when Mr. Wissy Jones, from United Lymphomiloid, arrives in the town of Peqoud and presents an offer to outright purchase an exceptional child, Barry Rudd, who is blessed with an extreme intelligence and a maturity beyond his years, for some unspecified project that will 'aid the national defense'.<br />As we proceed through the hearings, we are treated to some fine characterization of the witnesses, from the sharply opinionated and articulate principal of the school Barry attends to Barry's mumbling, street-wise but not too intelligent blue-collar friend. But the hearings also expose the first of Hersey's sharply satirical looks at our society as we see the conduct of the various senators running the hearing, obviously meant to remind the reader of the McCarthy hearings, with their forcible cutting off of any testimony that does not fit the pre-defined expectation of what the outcome of the hearing should be, denigration of witnesses' lifestyles, and panel members who clearly do not have the intelligence to even understand what testimony is given.<br />More horrifying, though, is the picture of the educational system presented, from the ivory-tower intellectual theories that have no relation to the classroom, to the constant attempts to make all students fit one pre-determined mold, to the administrative power struggles, to the bizarre web of psychological testing, to the clueless PTA, to the rigid and hypocritical moral code that schools use to bludgeon non-conforming students.  Where in this morass is the place for the truly gifted child, or for that matter one who is intellectually challenged? Hersey's points strike like daggers, for even though this book was written more than forty years ago, our schools still have every problem that is shown here.<br />And what of the moral outrage that should adhere to the concept of selling a child? Once more, Hersey's pen is savage, showing how easily Barry's parents sell out for a few material goods, how the senators are converted by the mere statement that it's for the 'national defense', how the general township is so easily convinced to get rid of this 'different' kid, and, most poignantly, how even Barry, with full knowledge of what the program entails, reacts to the concept.<br />A very moralistic tale, told sharply and with defining moments of humanity,  bringing a near surrealistic concept into the all-too-possible realm of reality.or that matter one who is intellectually challenged?

The trip across America detailed in this book was undertaken at least in part as an attempt by Steinbeck to determine if this evaluation of the state of America was valid, if when Americans were approached as individuals, face-to-face, some other picture might emerge.<br />To facilitate his investigation, Steinbeck brought along his poodle Charley, as companion and ice-breaker, and packed up a camper truck with everything he thought he might need in his travels (probably too much, as he ruefully admits at one point), and proceed to travel across the states in a large circle, from New York to Maine to Illinois to Washington, California, Texas, and the Deep South. As we travel along with him, we are treated to a rather incredible display of the sheer writing talent that Steinbeck possessed, as the people he meets along the way are described accurately and so very concisely, sometimes in just a couple of paragraphs, to where these people come alive to the reader, to where the reader can say \\"I know someone just like that\\".<br />But perhaps more importantly, the book is spattered throughout with Steinbeck's acute observations and opinions on everything from antiques, the virtues of small towns, the value of manual labor, the homogenizing of American language and cuisine due to the influence of radio and television, the beginnings of the interstate system and its influence on everything along its routes, hunters, trash, and many other items, all carefully supported by his actual observations along the road. There are a few comments expressed by Charley here, too (typically a \\"Fttt\\" and a sniff). And although this book was written forty years ago, much of what Steinbeck wrote then is still very valid today. Whether this represents a good thing or not, that there has been so little change in some very basic elements of American society in the intervening years, must be decided and thought upon by the reader.<br />It seems that many writers of stature eventually write some form of 'travel' book. This is one of the best of this genre, due to both Steinbeck's great powers of observation and his ability to distill what he sees to something that is recognizable, distinctive, that resonates with the reader's own experiences.  This is not his greatest book - that distinction belongs to his great fiction works of The Grapes of Wrath, The Pearl, East of Eden, The Winter of Our Discontent.

Cherryh is justifiably praised for her unique alien cultures, her complex political and social settings and plots, her sense of fast paced action and psychological insights. But it seems that she reserves all these good qualities for her science fiction novels, and is almost a different writer when it comes to fantasy.<br />Fortress spends it first 200 pages on just two characters, the wizard Mauryl and his Shaping Tristen. Mauryl is one of the world's oldest creatures, and reputably one of the strongest, part of both the first and second great ages of this world. But when the book opens we are in the third age, and Mauryl is old, his powers not quite what they were. His Shaping of Tristen is his last great act of wizardry, and it does not go totally according to plan, for when Tristen appears, he knows nothing of his abilities or purpose or even the essentials of what it is to be human, and must be painstakingly taught by Mauryl. And here we see one of the main failings of this book - Mauryl could obviously be a very deep and intriguing character, but we are given almost no details about his earlier life, about what type of person he is, about why he felt that summoning his Shaping was necessary. Instead we view almost everything through the eyes of Tristen, at this point very much an innocent, who can only see the obvious. And Mauryl's enemy is very nebulous, manifesting as a wind, a shaking, with no background of what he is, what his capabilities are, or even why he is Mauryl's enemy. All of this would be perfectly acceptable for a 15 page introduction to the main story, but here it is stretched out over a very slow moving, apparently pointless 200.<br />After this point, when Tristen is forced to go on the road to discover his purpose, and we start the see the whole imagined world, the novel gets much better. Here we find Cefwyn, heir to the throne, dealing with the constant political intrigues of feudal society, a scenario that allows Cherryh to stretch her legs and begin to show the writing she is capable of, mixing multiple very distinct characters and event lines with a complexity she handles very nicely. As the world is painted in, we also begin to find out its history and the faint beginnings of who Mauryl's enemy is, and a little insight into just what Tristen is.  When Cherryh gets to describe the problems and logistics of putting a feudal army into the field, every detail rings true, and the reader gets a real sense of actually being part of this world.  But we also find the second major problem with this book, and that is Tristen himself. As we proceed through the story, Tristen finds that he has abilities and talents that manifest at need - such as when required to ride a horse, he immediately shows the talents of a master horseman. This is a very dangerous deus-ex-machina plot device, as Cherryh can basically state at any point that Tristen now suddenly has such-and-such ability to be able to deal with whatever the current problem is. And it is this rabbit-out-of-the-hat feeling that mars the denouement of this book, making it far less exciting than it could have been.<br />A well constructed world that shows intimations of being very intriguing, some very good characters, especially Cefwyn, but little sense of high fantasy, poor pacing, and an ending that left this reader with a letdown feeling.gs and begin to show the writing she is capable of, mixing multiple very distinct characters and event lines with a complexity she handles very nicely.

But this one is not as wacky as some his previous efforts, and also not as funny (total number of puns in this work is down by at least 50% from prior pieces of this ongoing saga). As the punning is one of the major attractions of this series, this is a serious detriment.<br /> And I didn't get as emotionally attached to the characters and their problems in this one. Often his characters, in their more serious moments, provide a fine illumination of the problems all humanity faces, and by being recognizable people (as strange as they are), forces the reader to accept these insights as having a certain level of validity. But the characters in this book seemed a little thin, going through their motions, but without the underlying touches that would make them a part of the reader's world, that turn them into the person you met last week.<br />Still a fun read, and a nice addition to the one the longest running 'bar' gags ever, but not up to the earlier stories level of insight and hilarity.	2002-03-31

This book is one of the finer examples of both of those items, winning (quite appropriately) the Hugo award for 1969 (though I thought that Samuel Delany's Nova was just as deserving that year).<br />Stylistically, this book is a mosaic, a patchwork of cross-cutting images, scenes, advertisements, headlines, interviews, scientific paper excerpts, startlingly different from almost everything else published up till then. It takes a little bit to get used to this style, to let the world picture build into something coherent in your mind. But once you do, it lends a verisimilitude and a sense of frenetic pace that is perfectly suited to this dystopian vision of a world staggering under severe over-population pressure, driven by mega-corporations and military influence, forced genetic regulation, socialism and severe pressure to conform. From the Mr. and Mrs. Everyman that has become a daily part of everyone's daily video viewing to the 'muckers' so prophetically envisioned (just see today's headlines), this is an expose of just what happens when there really are too many people crowded onto too small a planet.<br />Some portions of this are a little dated, mainly in those areas where Brunner used straight-line extrapolations of trends that were present at the time of writing, such as the liquid-nitrogen cooled mega-computer (rather than any vision of today's internet) or the portrayed 'integration' of blacks in the society.  But these items do not seriously detract from the power and depth of the themes that tackled here. Characterization is a little thin. Other than Norman and Donald Hogan, most of the characters are pretty flimsy, or they are an obvious preaching board for Brunner's thematic comments (Chad Mulligan).  But as this is an idea book, not a book of character or strong action, this is a minor fault.<br />This book was probably the archetype for today's cyberpunk sub-genre, written with power and conceptual brilliance, one of Brunner's best, standing alongside his The Whole Man, The Sheep Look Up, and The Jagged Orbit as prime examples of just what science fiction is all about. A dark vision of which all too much is still very relevant in today's world.acter or strong action, this is a minor fault. <br />This book was probably the archetype for today's cyberpunk sub-genre, written with power and conceptual brilliance, one of Brunner's best, standing alongside his The Whole Man, The Sheep Look Up, and The Jagged Orbit as prime examples of just what science fiction is all about.

Clearly this has an implication of being usable as a 'spy' scope, where everyone's most private actions can be discerned. It is this use that gets the scope dubbed as the 'Pooper Scooper' and leads to political machinations for control of its use.  But the scientists running the scope have also stumbled across messages encoded within the particle stream, messages sent by alien civilizations for unclear purposes and which when viewed leave the viewer with a burnt out mind. Into this hardware scenario Anthony sends a very enigmatic individual, one Ivo Archer, (note that name choices are important here), an apparently normal person who happens to have some very wild, super-genius level talents in certain very restricted areas, to help determine what these messages are and why they are so destructive.  But Ivo is more than he seems to be, and as we follow the story as it progresses from Earth bound considerations to a galactic encyclopedia to interstellar war with some truly different alien life forms all the way to the fate of universe and folding other ideas into the mix, such as astrology as a true science, the reader is treated to an incredible trip through the minds of more than one genius.<br /><br />Anthony's characterization of these geniuses is very well done, and gives great insight into the thought processes and emotional characteristics of these exceptional people. On top of that, he buries a character mystery inside the main story, a question of just who is the legendary Schon, a supposed super-genius with absolutely no conscience, and how such a person is molded by his compatriots and environment. The psychological insights displayed here form a prime sub-text underneath the fantastic action of the story, and elevate this work well beyond a simple adventure novel.<br /><br />In most of his early works, Anthony showed a predilection for playing with mathematical ideas rather than physics concepts, and this work is no exception, introducing the game of sprouts, an apparently simple pencil and paper game that the reader will find is actually a fiendishly complicated foray into the world of 'rubber-band' mapping (topology), neatly folded into and enhancing the main story line.<br /><br />This work was nominated for the 1970 Hugo Award. Unfortunately, it was up against both Le Guin's The Left Hand of Darkness and Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five that year, two other truly great works in the SF world. But it is more than worth the effort to find and read this incomprehensibly out-of-print book of fantastic ideas, high adventure, and great character, which I have kept on my top 50 list of best all-time science fiction works ever since I first read it.rocesses and emotional characteristics of these exceptional people.

US	51152905	R38MC6W6FW72DO	0156001314	444581246	The Name of the Rose: including the Author's Postscript	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Reason and Dogma	This is a rather different book that will take a fair amount of effort on the part of the reader to understand and enjoy, but I think the effort is worth it. This is nominally a murder mystery at an isolated abbey set in the early 14th century, but there are several layers to this that will lead the reader down the course of actual history, into the dark sea of the minutia of Catholic dogma,  follow the deep valleys of both base and ennobling human emotions, and into the rift of the meaning and purpose of language.<br />The story is narrated by Adso, an apprentice monk to our star detective William of Baskerville, who has been obviously modeled on Sherlock Holmes. This narration provides a level of indirection, a distancing from the direct events, as it is supposedly being written by a very old Adso, long after the fact. It also allows Adso to make editorial comments along the way about his own feelings, the events and people around him, and the various Catholic arguments and historical personages and positions.  In some cases this device works very well, providing a platform where the mind-set of the times can be clearly presented. At other points, it is a detriment, as you can't get up close to all the characters and see their inner motivations.  And because of this, the murder mystery seems a little shallow, the reader can't get caught up in trying to figure out who is responsible for all the murders, at least not until very late in the book, as the reader has little of the motivation base to make proper guesses. But the mystery is almost secondary to the presentation of the religious points of view of the time that rocked the Catholic church to its foundations, points of view that are slowly revealed in the personal histories of the monks of the abbey alongside the 'official' positions of the papal and factional representatives.  Here the book shines, showing not only the dogmatic points, but their (often ironic) effects on both high and low people. And while these religious points may seem somewhat minor to the reader at first glance, something like the debate about  'angels on a pin', after a while it will become apparent that these points really do have relevance to all people of any religious persuasion.<br />At the denouement, the dogmatic persuasions of the various monks folds back into the reasons behind the murders, and here we finally get enough of individual character to make the reader care about both the situation and the people involved.  The final arguments between William and the perpetrator are an excellent discourse on the right of man to know and investigate all things versus the point of view of 'There are some things only God should know', with another level of meaning behind the arguments on language symbols and their effect on human reasoning.<br />Stylistically, this work is occasionally brilliant, especially in some of the descriptions of various religious artifacts and buildings, sharply different from the way things would normally be described by the average modern person, and provides a very effective setting of mood and mind-set while reading. There are some long passages in Latin, some of which are important to the story thread, and not all are translated, paraphrased, or meaning derivable from context, which forced me to try and puzzle out some of this from knowledge of word roots, as I don't read Latin.  In this area I think it would have helped if there had been at least a foot-noted translation made available.<br />Overall, a many-layered book with points of power and brilliance, a little weak in characterization and mystery action, but well worth the time and trouble to read, understand, and enjoy.these religious points may seem somewhat minor to the reader at first glance, something like the debate about  'angels on a pin', after a while it will become apparent that these points really do have relevance to all people of any religious persuasion. <br />At the denouement, the dogmatic persuasions of the various monks folds back into the reasons behind the murders, and here we finally get enough of individual character to make the reader care about both the situation and the people involved.

US	51152905	R1A56F8PEOFJPN	0380014033	772010642	Lord of Light	Books	5	19	21	N	N	The Cynical Enlightened Sam	Zelazny was a very bright shooting star when he first appeared on the fantasy/SF radar some 35 years ago, a new writer of power, originality, insight, and depth. Lord of Light was his third novel, and it exemplifies all these qualities in grand style. Combining the Hindu/Buddhist  mythos/religion with the science-fictional concepts of true re-incarnation via technology-enabled body swaps, set on world dominated by those who have access to the technology, and are thereby effectively real gods,  this book is a powerful statement of character, philosophy, and morality.<br />Mahasamatman, or Sam as he prefers to be called, is our protagonist for this trip through heaven, hell, and meditation, one of the original colonizing crew who has, over the centuries, fallen out of favor with the ruling coterie, who now style themselves as actually being the Hindu deities.  Sam, seeing the inequitable treatment of the colonist's descendents, the forcible holding back of their attempts at technological progress, the sometimes total denigration of these people as mere objects and the cynical attitude of the ruling group towards them, decides to become a one-man army to change the status-quo by preaching the heretical philosophies of Buddha.  But he finds his preaching has some unlooked-for consequences: he attracts a fanatical following and he finds it near impossible to not actually become the modern incarnation of the ancient philosopher, even though he does not totally subscribe to Buddha's philosophical outlook himself.  As we delve deeper into Sam's battle with Shiva, Kali, Brahma and the rest of ruling pantheon, we are given looks at the original battle to colonize the planet, when all the crew had to develop Attributes to fight the native denizens (almost literal demons) of the planet, Attributes now part of their chosen godly character.  In seeing this early period (which is highlighted by some very powerful and exciting battle descriptions), we get to see that none of these people are either totally evil or saintly, but are very human, with engaging foibles and distinctive characteristics. This is one of the main strengths of this book, as we have a large set of fully realized characters, each with their own motivations and desires, whose interactions form a complex weave of happenstance and emotional intertwinings, that give the novel a unique order and flow, and are sure to evoke multiple responses in the reader.<br />The prose style is more than adequate to the task here, sometimes brilliantly, almost poetically descriptive, at other points understated, leaving items just slightly nebulous, ready for the reader's imagination to complete. And the religious statements will burrow into your mind, forcing little cracks of enlightenment and quiet meditation.  The story is not told in linear order, which some may find a little confusing, but as each piece of the story is unfolded and wrapped into the whole, it forms a mosaic that layers in your mind, building a tightly interlocked edifice of strength and stature.<br />Zelazny here has managed to create an archetype, a legend for modern times, with real relevance to the reader's everyday life, with a great promotion of life philosophies without preaching. Sadly, Roger is no longer with us, there will be no more of these brilliant tour-de-forces, but this will stand as one of his finest gifts to the world.  A gift that everyone can enjoy and appreciate.people are either totally evil or saintly, but are very human, with engaging foibles and distinctive characteristics.

US	51152905	R73202LQ1BNJ8	0440178002	191357398	Shogun (Asian Saga)	Books	5	417	431	N	N	Honor and Barbarians	'Historical' fiction is something of a misnomer, as books placed in this category are almost always fiction first and 'historical' only in time and setting. Shogun, however, comes close to being a true example of this field, detailing the late 16th century exploration and exploitation of the Orient by the Portuguese, Dutch, Spanish, and English. As few Americans are aware of some of the atrocities and cruelties committed in the name of crown and religion during this period, some of the scenes depicted in this book may come as shock. But they provide an excellent background portrait of the European mind-set of those times, a palette that Clavell uses to contrast and define the extraordinarily different culture of the Japan of that time.<br />And it is his portrait of the Japanese, his lovingly detailed characterizations of Toranaga, Mariko, Omi and their deeply intertwined interactions with the English pilot Blackthorne that defines and breathes life into this breathtakingly large and complex story of love, war, and political intrigue. And these characters are not static. Each grows and changes as events unfold, most especially Blackthorne himself, growing from a totally self-centered 'barbarian' of unclean habits to a person who can appreciate the beauty, intelligence, and moral rectitude of others, who comes to care deeply for those around him, who comes to understand a philosophy of life totally different from that of his own culture. The reader will eventually take each of these characters into his heart, will live right along with them and their problems, cares, successes, and failures, until they are almost more real than the mundane world the reader inhabits.<br />Is this book totally historically accurate? No, but it doesn't really need to be. It is a fictional account of one of the defining moments of Japanese history, with all the requirements of a work of fiction, written for an American audience, and certain items have yielded to literary license to make the story more approachable by the reader. Certainly Toranaga would not have played chess, but would American readers have understood 'Go' as metaphor for Toranaga's deep political machinations? As a story, a tale of high adventure, as a hard look at alternative life philosophies, as an exposition of a very exotic time, place, and culture, this work succeeds on almost every level. This is an excellent read that will expand your horizons and enrich your life, entertain you and satisfy your inner craving for something different from the every-day world of today.the story more approachable by the reader.

Heinlein takes this textbook concept and adds two other ingredients to the mix: the twins are telepathic, and they are real people, in concocting this nice blend of great adventure and hard science.<br />Tom and Pat are the twins in question, targeted by the Long Range Foundation as a potential communications pair on the first exploratory star-ships due to their telepathic ability to communicate over any distance at (truly) instantaneous speeds. Which one will go and which will stay forms the initial conflict of this story, and how the decision is made provides a strong base for filling in the character of each, along with some interesting psychological insights into the problems that face close siblings.  While still on Earth, this section also allows Heinlein to throw in some of his typical comments about bureaucracies, government meddling, taxes, population control, and the non-democratic nature of families, all deftly folded into and directly contributing to the story line.<br />Once the starship takes off, we find something of a more traditional adventure story, as we follow Pat on the starship and his meeting with the duties and responsibilities of ship-board life and the unforeseen hazards that the ship encounters at each of the stars it explores. In the meantime, Tom is rapidly aging on Earth, the link between the two becomes very fragile, and eventually Pat manages to establish a new telepathic link with his niece (and later his grand and great-grand niece). All necessary in order to continue the starship mission, for without being able to report the findings of the explorations, there is little point in continuing.  As we move further and further out in time and space, we can see Pat grow as person, melded both by these external events and his own musings on the purpose of life and humanity, and it is this very growth that really provides the best portion of the 'entertainment'.<br />Heinlein fully recognized that positing instantaneous communications (of any nature) was a violation of Einstein's basic theory, and rather than ignore it, he used it as a springboard to a new science that forms the basis for the ending of this book.  It also allowed him to neatly finish off the story line of the two twins, but I found the ending not quite satisfying, a little too pat and quickly done (and with some gender-roles that would be considered decidedly non-politically correct today). Still, this is one of the best of his so-called 'juvenile' novels, both due to its great science and very solid characterization, couched in his typical, unforced American prose, and with enough 'meat' on its bones to engross any reader.ernal events and his own musings on the purpose of life and humanity, and it is this very growth that really provides the best portion of the 'entertainment'. <br />Heinlein fully recognized that positing instantaneous communications (of any nature) was a violation of Einstein's basic theory, and rather than ignore it, he used it as a springboard to a new science that forms the basis for the ending of this book.

At the time I thought this was a great book, and some of the images that were painted in my mind while reading this stayed with me through all the intervening years.  But time and science have marched relentlessly on since then, so I decided to look at this one again here in the 21st century. Alas, this book, unlike so many of Heinlein's other early novels, has not aged well. Revelations about the true conditions on Mars since this book was written push this book into the same fantasy realm as Burrough's Barsoom, and as the conditions on the planet form the underpinnings for all the action of this story, it severely detracts from the reader's willing 'suspension of disbelief'.<br /><br />This is not to say that this is not a very good story, as it definitely meets all the requirements of a rollicking good read.  Jim, his 'pet' Willis, and his friend Frank are two young men sent off to the Company sponsored school. Shortly after arriving there, a new headmaster is installed, who has very distinct ideas about what constitutes proper discipline, decorum, attire, and 'rights' the students should have. Naturally, this includes a 'no pets' rule, and Willis is 'confiscated'. While Willis is held prisoner, he gets to overhear an interesting conversation between the headmaster and the head of the Company. When the boys rescue Willis, due to  Willis' ability to repeat verbatim whatever he has heard (complete with exact voice matches) they learn there is a plot afoot to disallow the migration that the colonists normally do each Martian year so they will not have to stay holed up throughout the Martian winter. How they manage to do something about this situation forms a fine adventure, and along the way we are introduced to the 'real' Martians. The Martians shown here are the same ones that later populate his Stranger in a Strange Land, complete with water-ceremonies and 'old ones', and are the most captivating items of this book.<br /><br />Characterization is not excessively deep - it is very clear who are the good guys and who are not, and Willis makes a cute sidekick who has greater importance than is apparent at first glance.  The human colony 'society' is not very well fleshed out (unusual for Heinlein), and in a couple of places this is irritating, with its assumptions of 'Ozzie and Harriet\\" family structures and the place of women in society.<br /><br />For a young reader, the dating of this book shouldn't really be a problem - this is still a great adventure in a captivating setting. Adults may have more problems with this, but anyone looking for a little more about the Martians of Stranger in Strange Land should certainly give this book a look.this book.

While not absolutely necessary to enjoying this book, as there are enough explanatory sections here to catch the gist of the action of the prior books, I do recommend that you read the Assassin trilogy first, as it will not only provide the reader with all the past action, it will give you a fine benchmark of the how the characters were at the time of those books, allowing you to easily see the changes that time has wrought.<br /><br />This book picks up 15 years after the ending of the Farseer set, with FitzChivalry Farseer and his Wit bond-mate wolf Nighteyes leading a quiet life as a farmer trying to raise his adopted son Hap, carefully avoiding any traffic with his former life of intrigue as a royal assassin. This early section of the book is remarkable for how strong the character development is, even though there is almost no action during this portion, showing a much more mature Fitz who has almost come to terms with the sacrifices he was required to make in the earlier books. Of course, this idyllic setting can't last, as first his former mentor Chade arrives for a visit to try and convince Fitz to return to service at Buckkeep Castle, followed  by the very enigmatic Fool, now known as Lord Golden, and finally is convinced to return to Buckkeep by a summons from Chade to help find Prince Dutiful, Fitz's son by body, but not by himself as a person, who has either been kidnapped or run away.<br /><br />Thus the action is enjoined, leading Fitz not just away from his farm, but into consideration of the whys and needs of both his Wit and Skill abilities. A set of considerations that have relevance for everyone, questions on should you lead if you can, can you let a social injustice continue when you have the means and ability to do something about it, about the importance of life and the time to properly allow death to reign, the strength of personal relationships and what is owed to friends, where the responsibilities of a parent begin and end. Throughout, Fitz, Nighteyes, and the Fool continue to grow as characters, till you feel that these are people you know, have lived, ached, lost and triumphed with.<br /><br />Hobb's descriptive powers are well in evidence here, and her characters are neatly folded into her imagined universe, that includes not just the world of Wit and Skill of the Assassin works but also is explicitly tied to her Live Ship set, though that tie, so far, is only mentioned in passing, not fully developed. This book, unlike so many that are planned as part of a larger group of works, is very complete in itself, with an excellent resolution to all the problems and concerns it starts with. But I have a feeling the next book will make more of the tie to the Liveships and Bingtown traders, and I am looking forward to it.en you have the means and ability to do something about it, about the importance of life and the time to properly allow death to reign, the strength of personal relationships and what is owed to friends, where the responsibilities of a parent begin and end.

Brin latest accomplishes this feat with a fair amount of elan, as he envisages a world where people can make ditto copies of themselves, impressed into variously hued clay molds that can only 'live' for a day, after which they must return to their originator, 'upload' their day's memories, and expire.<br />Our protagonist, Albert, is naturally a detective, blessed with ability to make near perfect copies of himself that he can send out to do the leg work of his business. He must operate in a world where almost all work is done by ditto copies, where 99% of the 'real' population must live on the dole, not having any marketable unique abilities to sell.  As a result of a supposedly successful 'bust' of one of his arch-enemy Beta's illegal ditto-cloning operations, he comes to the attention of Ritu, daughter of one of the founding scientific minds of the ditto-cloning technology, who has turned up missing. From here the plot gets complicated, as the missing father shows up dead, but his ditto clones are still around, bent on some incomprehensible scheme of their own, and one of Albert's dittos is hired to (unknowingly) sabotage one of the main ditto manufacturing plants of Vic Kaolin, recluse and close collaborator with Ritu's father. Complication is piled on complication, and Albert's multiple dittos each become characters in their own right as they follow various threads of the mystery.<br />This is probably the best part of this book, as by showing how each ditto, starting from the same base, is modified by the events he experiences; each one, while retaining the greater part of their originator's character, slowly morphs into a distinct individual. This is some excellent characterization work. It also brings forth some of the thematic drive of the novel, a questioning of what makes each person unique, more than just an organized collection of atoms. As part of this Brin envisions that the metaphysical 'soul' has a real physical aspect, a field or 'Soul Wave'. Indeed it is this aspect of a person that allows the 'ditto' cloning technology to exist.<br />However, Brin stretches this concept too far, trying to make it extend from quantum mechanics to what is God (and how to make one!). His explanations become rather rarified, especially as delivered by Ritu's 'ditto' copy father, who by this point is that cliche of cliches, the mad scientist out to remake the world in his own warped image.<br />Brin does a fair amount of punning in this book, especially in his chapter titles, and while some of them are absolute groaners, they add a certain amount of warmth, a leavening of humor to what is essentially a very serious story.  In general style it follows the precepts of the hard-bitten detective genre and does of pretty fair job without becoming a parody.<br />The denouement, when all the various threads are tied together and all the mysteries are solved, is marred by the fact that one of the major players in all the action is never really presented as a character in his own right, whose motivations the reader cannot possibly know, and thus leaves the reader feeling a little cheated, that Brin has pulled one too many rabbits out of the hat.<br />An ambitious book, with some great ideas, a lively investigation into individualism, privacy, and psychology, some great characters, but doesn't quite form a fully fleshed out mystery and fails in its upper reaches for meaning.ch person unique, more than just an organized collection of atoms.

This could have been a deep examination into the hows, whys, and moral correctness of immortality. This could have been a strong expose of how cutting edge research into 'fringe' areas of science is funded and the influence such funding has on the results and how they are used. Unfortunately, we get none of these.<br />At the start, we find Hal Cousins on a deep bathyscaph dive to try and collect specimens of truly primitive bacteria that he thinks hold the key to the biological 'clock' that seems to control aging in all higher lifeforms. During the dive, the bathyscaph's driver, for no apparent reason, attacks Hal, and later, after surfacing, commits apparent suicide by jumping into a very cold sea. This whole scene does nothing but confuse the reader, as at this early stage of the book, none of the characters have been developed enough to allow the reader to see that the behavior of both people on the sub is slowly becoming aberrant and psychotic.  I was very close to closing up the book at this point and putting it on the shelf as not worth reading. Given what followed, this impulse should have been followed.<br />From the initial reasonable scientific premise that Bear starts with, the plot continues to thicken with impossible conspiracies, improbable connections to biological research done in 1930's Russia, paranoid and schizophrenic characters, and sudden jumps in the later stages of the book to new characters who are there apparently only to help further confuse the plot, rather than any rational development of the original idea.  True character development is almost nil and the actions of the fairly large cast often seem to have no logical basis. Some characters are introduced and then almost immediately dropped, leading to just another stubbed off plot thread.<br />This book either needed a lot more pages to fully develop all the plot threads and characters, or the entire focus of the book needed to be narrowed down to a single set of ideas that were consistently developed. As it is, we have a mish-mash of partially developed plot lines and thematic ideas, none of which are fully satisfying or resolved, which Bear effectively admits with his closing round-up of questions that the book has not answered.

US	51152905	R2W9P274H9ASRD	0345330129	439022701	The Door into Summer	Books	5	8	9	N	N	A Door into your Heart	At least until the group of books he wrote very late in his career, Heinlein tackled the theme of time travel very rarely, but when he did, most notably in \\"By His Bootstraps\\" and \\"...All You Zombies\\", the results were exemplary. With this book, Heinlein not only deals with time travel in a logically consistent manner, he manages to foresee CAD (computer aided drafting), the equivalent of Velcro for clothing, cryogenics applied as a method people might use to freeze themselves hoping for later medical advances to cure their ills, and the proliferation of robotics down to the household level. This last prediction hasn't come true yet, but it's at least on the horizon. In all, a remarkable set of technological predictions. But these are just side points to an excellent story of love and betrayal, told in first person from the viewpoint of one Daniel Boone Davis, inventor, engineer, and totally naive in the ways of women.<br /><br />It's this last trait that leads to all the troubles Davis faces, as he falls head-over-heels for the secretary he and his partner hire to help run their new business of making and marketing his Hired Girl robot. Naturally, the 'secretary' is a sharpie out to take the company for all she can get, and she and Davis' partner eventually manage to screw Davis royally, leaving him bitter and willing to take the 'Cold Sleep' treatment for 30 years to get away from the mess. Before going to sleep, however, he decides to talk to his partner one last time. The ensuing scene, with his partner and secretary being attacked by his cat Pete while he is drugged into immobility, is one of the most amusing and endearing 'fights' in all of SF.  The 'fight', however valiant, is lost, and Davis ends up taking the cold sleep, to awake in the year 2000.<br /><br />His impressions and problems for that year, and how he eventually finds a way to travel back to the year 1970 in order to straighten out the problems with his former partner and secretary, form the balance of this fine adventure. Through all of this, Heinlein, most unusually for him, paints an extremely optimistic viewpoint, both for scientific advances and for human nature. Lacking in the heavy philosophy that so often characterizes his later works, it never the less has something important to say about the human condition, best exemplified by this quote: \\"I had taken a partner once before -- but, damnation, no matter how many times you get your fingers burned, you have to trust people. Otherwise you are a hermit in a cave, sleeping with one eye open. There wasn't any way to be safe; just being alive was deadly dangerous...fatal. In the end.\\"<br /><br />A fun, fast read, and the characterization of Davis is excellent, a person you get to know and admire for all his block-headed stubbornness.  The ending will probably bring tears to your eyes -- hopefully, yes, one of the doors of your house will be a Door into Summer, if you just keep trying doors.<br /><br />This book probably missed out on a Hugo due to an accident of timing, as the 1957 World Science Fiction Convention was held in London and decided not to give out any Hugos for fiction. Perhaps it will be awarded a 'Retro' Hugo in 2007 - it deserves it.e adventure.

Cherryh has been developing her universe of the Alliance/Union empires for quite some time through several books. Most of these are very good action novels with complicated plots and believable characters, but they typically do not have deep themes.  Cyteen, however, is the centerpiece of this universe, with great, insightful looks at the ethics and methods of cloning, slavery, identity (what makes you you?), genetics versus environment, the art of politics, and an incredible look at the inner psychology of the gifted, super-intelligent. This book is not an easy read - it requires some effort and thought by the reader to understand the points presented, but the reader will be richly rewarded for his effort.<br />The prose style is very clipped, almost abbreviated, and does much to give the reader a sense of unstoppable, pell-mell action and high tension, but it does take some getting used to. Especially at the beginning of the book, where Cherryh drops the reader into this very complex and alien world with very little background explanation of the situation, the people, or the world, it is easy for the reader to become lost and confused. But if the reader will persevere, bit by bit he will find an envisioned world constructed in the best traditions of the field, fully as rich and satisfying as Tolkien's Middle Earth or Herbert's Dune, but with dark overtones reminiscent of Huxley's Brave New World and the paranoid mind control of Orwell's 1984.<br />The plot is a complex intertwining of power politics, intriguing scientific concepts, and the personal life histories of some very dynamic characters caught up in the Byzantine struggles for ultimate control of this world.  And it is the characters that truly define and invigorate this story, fully realized, highly believable (a very difficult thing to achieve when these characters are super-geniuses), with real concerns and each with their own set of inner problems. Both the original Ari and the clone of her that we follow through most of the book are exceptional people, a refreshingly strong and different female lead compared to so many of the stereotypes that have littered the field of SF. Justin is also finely drawn, a good counterpoint to Ari, struggling with his own problems of personal identity and self-worth.<br />I have added only two books to my 'Best of SF' list in the last 15 years. This is one of them. Take the time and effort to read and understand this book and the many ethical/philosophical/psychological points that Cherry brings to the fore in the course of this novel, and you will find your time was well spent.we follow through most of the book are exceptional people, a refreshingly strong and different female lead compared to so many of the stereotypes that have littered the field of SF.

US	51152905	R34BJR7AADQPRV	0312874065	218899544	Probability Moon (The Probability Trilogy)	Books	3	2	2	N	N	A Shared Reality	Probability Moon introduces a neat idea: along with the standard forces of gravity, strong and weak nuclear forces, and electromagnetism, there is a fifth force, probability, which can be controlled (in this case, via a left-over artifact of a long vanished civilization). The major effect: the ability to make almost any element radioactive (after all, the fission of an atom, proton, meson, etc, is all described as a probability of decay in a given time period). At a different 'power' setting, it can used to affect how the human brain works, by changing the probability of which (and how) neurons fire. It's this latter item that forms the basis for this novel: an entire world, under the artifact's influence for several thousand years, has developed a society that has 'shared reality', where quite literally people can feel another's pain, where there is only one view of the world, and new and different ideas can cause serious 'head pain'. As such, it paints a picture of a type of utopia, with never the less some warts, some people who don't quite fit, or who have performed some action beyond the pale that gets them labeled 'unreal' (and therefore not just stigmatized but almost literally unseeable). Into this world come the Terrans, at war with a truly alien species, and most anxious to grab and understand the ancient's artifacts, which includes not only the 'small' device affecting the world, but the entire moon of the planet.<br />The good things about this book are decent hard science concepts and competent characterization. What drags it down is an almost stereotypical plot in terms of both the Terran war and the changes caused in the society by Terran interference. I felt that her depicted society could have used a lot more exposition; in too many places how it really works is only briefly sketched.  And the near mindless depiction of the Terran military is poor, a prop used to bring 'action' to the plot.  But her prose is very readable, and the story flow is smooth, with a net result of a quick read with some excitation of the reader's 'sense of wonder', a prime ingredient in a 'hard' SF work.<br /> This is my first introduction to Kress at novel length - she has been a rapidly rising star at shorter lengths as evidenced by her Hugo and Nebula awards. From the evidence here, she will be a fine addition to the limited stable of  'hard' SF writers as her story telling ability at longer lengths improves.oth, with a net result of a quick read with some excitation of the reader's 'sense of wonder', a prime ingredient in a 'hard' SF work.<br /> This is my first introduction to Kress at novel length - she has been a rapidly rising star at shorter lengths as evidenced by her Hugo and Nebula awards.

US	51152905	R327PSGFRW34KG	0312890389	205981594	Pacific Edge: Three Californias (Wild Shore Triptych)	Books	3	12	16	N	Y	Utopian Gnats	This book is part of Robinson's 'Three Californias&quot; triptych about alternate futures seen from the perspective of Orange County, California. Gold Coast is a dystopia, The Wild Shore is post-apocalyptic, and this book completes the thematic triangle as a utopia. Here we find a future that is a melding of socialism, capitalism, democracy, and strong ecological concerns.  Personal income and business sizes have strict upper limits, everyone is required to devote some of their labor hours to community projects (usually involving some form of ecological cleanup), most people live as part of communal co-operatives, but at the same time people are free to chose their own jobs, live where they wish, have a voice in community affairs, and can say what they want.<br />Like most utopias, there are a few flies in the ointment, and it is around these that the story line is based. Here we find Alfredo, the town mayor, scheming a way to go beyond the personal income limit, and the company he is associated with has become involved in shady deals to try and sidestep the limits on company size. The object of the scheming is an undeveloped hill commanding a great aesthetic view of the town and valley it sits in, and the book starts with an attempt to rezone the hill for commercial development. The book's protagonist, Kevin, something of an idealist and nature lover, not terribly politically astute but stubborn, stalls the attempt, but the battle is joined. As counterpoint to the political battle, Kevin becomes romantically involved with Alfredo's long-time lover Ramona, who has just split up with Alfredo.<br />Unfortunately, these story threads are only mildly interesting. There is little work done to explore either the pluses or minuses of the envisioned society, Kevin's personal problems are not strong enough, do not have enough angst, to make the reader become terribly involved in them, the basic object of the battle, the hill, does not seem deserving of all the energy devoted to it. This seems to be a typical problem with utopian novels - at their heart, utopias are necessarily dull, not having any strong points of contention on which to base a story. All of the actions of this book seem somewhat inconsequential, the object of contention is really a molehill, not a mountain.<br />The prose style is easy, the main characters are reasonably well developed, the plot line is coherent.

It covers almost every conceivable aspect of science fiction, from movies to history to criticism. This is the second edition of this work, with large updates to bring the work up to the time of publication (1992), especially new authors and newer works by old hands, and there has also been a good deal of new material added to the thematic sections.<br />For anyone wanting to develop a good course on science fiction , or anyone interested in how SF came to be what it is today, a perusal of these thematic entries on everything from ANTIGRAVITY to MUTANTS to UTOPIAS will yield a wealth of material concisely presented, profusely cross-referenced, and source material properly indicated. Often within these sections even an experienced long-time fan of the field will find works referenced that he hasn't heard of before but deserve a look.<br />Within the author entries you will find one of the works most useful features: a listing of all of that author's  works that belong within a given series or author created world/universe, often with a good description of the salient features of these author worlds. Also very useful is a listing of all known pseudonyms for each author. Still another useful feature is the indication of every variant title a work has appeared under, which can end up saving the reader money by knowing that he already really has that title under a different name. But these entries are also the most problematic of the information presented in this volume, as the opinion of the writer of the piece (almost all of the author entries were done by John Clute) about the quality of each of the author's works clearly shows.  While it is probably impossible to avoid having this type of opinion appear, what I found disappointing was the lack of indication that there are other opinions about some well known works (in some cases these other opinions run to millions of words and many a flame war on the internet), such as Heinlein's Starship Troopers.  At the same time, these entries provide a wealth of biographical information and very complete bibliographies for every major and almost every minor writer who has ever written within the field, and this information seems to have been very solidly researched (at least I haven't been able to find any obvious errors, and I've been reading in the field for 40 years).<br />This is an expensive volume, but it is probably worth every penny of its price when you consider that it collects in one volume such a wealth of diverse information that prior to this work was scattered across hundreds of articles, essays, books, and research papers or had never been written about in any cohesive manner.

Do we really need another one? In the case of this book, the answer to that is a resounding yes! Robinson has crafted a finely wrought work of character and theme that will resonate with readers, that is highly evocative of some of the other truly fine works within this sub-genre, from Pangborn's Davy to Stewart's Earth Abides, that delivers insights into societies and individual human motivations at a level rarely found in any fiction.<br />This book is part of Robinson's triptych (the other two pieces being The Gold Coast and Pacific Edge) that deals with various futures as seen from the perspective of Orange County, California. These books are related by theme only, and can all be read independently of the others. In this one the United States has effectively been destroyed by the use of about 3000 neutron bombs that were smuggled in by truck (the country of origin never provable but supposed to be Russia), turning almost every city into a waste land and wiping out the economic and industrial structure that allows today's Americans to enjoy a standard of living so very much higher than most of the rest of the world. The United States has now been placed in quarantine by the rest of the world, and any attempts to try to re-organize and re-build the country are ruthlessly disrupted. Orange County has returned to a fishing/agrarian level society with government by communal consensus.  But this is the mere background to a remarkable tale of two young men, Henry and Steve, trying to find their own way and life answers within this community, underneath the strong influence of the town elder Tom, one of the last survivors who remembers what America was like before the bombs. Henry and Steve are close friends but are two very different personalities, and how each reacts to the opportunity to 'do something' to those who are maintaining the quarantine forms the main basis of the book.<br />The depth of characterization here is remarkable, and the portrayal of the society that grew under these imagined  conditions is just as remarkable for its believability and economic viability. I found myself living and feeling right along with the main characters, could see myself in just the situations portrayed, facing the same moral dilemmas and wondering just how I would react, what I would do.  The prose is smooth and with a nice balance between description, dialogue, and action, and a theme that is presented via  'show, not tell' methods.<br />All of the 'Three Californias' books are good, but this one is clearly the best, and should be put on everyone's 'must read' list.the quarantine forms the main basis of the book. <br />The depth of characterization here is remarkable, and the portrayal of the society that grew under these imagined  conditions is just as remarkable for its believability and economic viability.

For most authors, this is a mistake. Not so with this set of five stories placed in the world of Le Guin's marvelous Earthsea. Each story provides a new illumination into what Earthsea is, its history, and the people that lived and loved within it.<br />The first story, &quot;The Finder&quot;, is the longest, actually a novella, and for my money the best of the set.  Here we find ourselves far back in the history of Earthsea, when wizard fought wizard as a matter of course, when magical knowledge was jealously guarded, when the average non-magical person lived in fear of what magic would visit them next. Otter, a half-trained wizard with a powerful skill for 'finding' whatever he looks for, falls on the receiving end of the worst of this mis-use of magic, forced to try and find mercury, the King of all materials, for a half-crazed older wizard. How he escapes from this imprisonment, and his search for a place where magic is taught freely, forms the bulk of this story, ending with his founding of the School of Wizards on Roke.  In this story we find the same evocation of the magical, of balance between man and nature, of ambition tempered by internal morality, that so graced the original trilogy.<br />The second story, &quot;Darkness and Diamond&quot;, has appeared elsewhere previously, but it deserves a second reading, being a beautifully told love story of a boy with conflicted desires between his wizardly talent and its concomitant requirement of chastity, and his love of music and a girl who shares his passions. A fine portrait of what is important in the business of living.<br />The third and fourth stories, &quot;The Bones of the Earth&quot; and &quot;On the High Marsh&quot;, are comparatively minor stories, that never the less do a good job of filling in some of the history of Ged, showing his first teacher in his greatest wizardly act, and a mature Ged who can forgive and help heal a former Arch-mage.<br />The last story, &quot;Dragonfly&quot;, has also appeared elsewhere, but it is a must read before tackling the latest Earthsea novel, The Other Wind. This is story that I think many fans of the series object to, as it details the heretical idea that women both can and should wield magical powers, that their power, based on the Old Powers, is just as valid as the complex hierarchy of talents embodied by the School of Wizards. Is this a change from the world of the first three novels? Certainly, but I think it is a change for the better, more fitting with the overall theme of balance that pervades the entire Earthsea universe. As Le Guin herself states in the forward, it has been a long time since the first books were written, and history and people move on, grow and develop, and this story exemplifies this very well.<br />For fans of the originals, this is a must book. For those who have never been charmed and captivated by Earthsea, now is the time to read the series in its glorious whole.l a former Arch-mage.<br />The last story, &quot;Dragonfly&quot;, has also appeared elsewhere, but it is a must read before tackling the latest Earthsea novel, The Other Wind.

Within these letters, Delany shows just how completely draconian and life-meddling the IRS can be, as he finds himself without heat, trying to type with mittened  fingers,  scavenging  cans from the street to get enough money to put food on the table for a day, trying to set his schedule to still provide a nice home for his daughter, where he must have someone else cash his royalty checks so he at least has some money the IRS doesn't immediately grab. And just as nightmarish  are his problems with getting his works published, galleys corrected, artwork commissioned and delivered, all under a cloud of mis-information, missed publisher and printer dates,  payment contracts that almost amount to slave labor, a phantasmagoric depiction of the Byzantine world of publishing.<br />On the opposite side of the coin, we see a man who has the freedom to choose a life style that the Ministry of Love would never condone, who can freely publish ideas about politics, sex, and writing that the Ministry of Information would have certainly censored.  Delany's ideas in these areas are certainly insightful and he articulates his positions well, even if you don't agree with his conclusions. Some of the material here may not be everyone's taste, as he is occasionally extremely graphic in his depictions of various sexual encounters, but this material shows a Delany who is comfortable with who he is.<br />About my only real complaint is that we don't get to see the other side of these letters, that we only hear one side of the conversation.  And sometimes it is obvious that that other side would be very interesting to be able to read. And a couple of quibbles: there are often references to people obviously known to both correspondents, but who is a complete unknown to the reader (some of these are footnoted as to who they are, but far from all), and, as letters, these works are lacking in the often poetic sense of language that Delany displays in his fictional works. But overall, these letters provide a fascinating look at a fascinating, brilliant, poetic, and sometimes very human person.of these letters, that we only hear one side of the conversation.

Both trends have had some deviations from that straight line in the years since this was written, but that does not invalidate the main focus of this book, that of not only how an individual can make a difference in the world around him, but why he should try to make that difference.<br />Jim, the prime protagonist, is a much conflicted individual, who really has not found out what he really believes is right or what he should do with his life. Involved in a seemingly endless round of parties with his friends, having no serious commitment to his lady friend, holding two desultory part-time jobs that he has no enthusiasm for, considering himself to be a writer with a strong interest in the history of Orange County but without any finished product he thinks is good, and still partially dependent on his parents for support, he is a prime target for suggestion and peer pressure to define his actions. When one of his friends suggests that he should actually do something to change the domination of the country by the military-industrial complex, he jumps at the chance, and soon finds himself involved in industrial sabotage.  His father, in the meantime, is also fighting the same war, but from a completely different perspective of an engineer actively employed by that same complex, trying to find a technical solution to the MAD arms-race.<br />Along the way to Jim finding his own resolution to his life, we are treated to historical snapshots of Orange County from its very early settling by native Americans to the coming of the Spanish, to its flowering as an agricultural paradise,  to its great industrial expansion during and after World War II, and finally to the condition depicted at the time of this book, as an almost totally asphalt covered warren of apartments, malls, offices, and neon lighting that has forgotten its historical and ecological heritage. These sections, viewed separately from the rest of the book, form something of an extended prose poem, with a very heavy 'back-to-nature' message, that intertwine with Jim's search for meaning in his life,  and provide a strong under-current to the novel's action.<br />The opening of this book is very rough, with too many characters introduced too briefly, with trivial and sometimes outdated dialogue, and without any apparent clear focus or direction. It is not till almost halfway through the book that it settles down and starts showing depth and direction. From this point on, the novel becomes much better, as the reader becomes interested in the characters and moral dilemma's they and their world face.<br />This is not KSR's best novel. The book wanders for too long before finding its legs, and the ecological sub-theme is sometimes too strident, the bashing of capitalism inadequately supported. But it has something to say about both our current industrial society and about the everyday individual's place in that society, about making a difference, about having commitments and moral integrity, about both the 'how' and the 'why' a life should be lived.asphalt covered warren of apartments, malls, offices, and neon lighting that has forgotten its historical and ecological heritage.

US	51152905	R1AVEQ1C82L226	0151006849	645828812	The Other Wind (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 6)	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Of Promises and Names	The Earthsea tales, from the very beginning, have always been different from the average fantasy, focusing far more on individual character and actions than on grand battles, and with a dark overtone, dealing with very adult themes of the balance of nature, life after death, love and ambition. The Other Wind is no exception. Still told with Le Guin's sparse but finely drawn prose, this books re-unites almost all of the major characters from the earlier books along with some interesting new ones to deal with the problem of the dead trying to tear down the wall that separates them from the living. And the strength of this book lies directly in this characterization, as we find that the characters from earlier books have changed, sometimes radically, such as Ged, who is no longer arch-mage but rather a quietly satisfied farmer, and the new characters have their own loves, doubts, uncertainties, and inner strengths. The reader will find it easy to empathize with these characters, as all correspond with real people in a very real world.<br />The plot line is rather sparse, with little action and a lack of strong tension or great dramatic moments. This is far more a 'thinking' book, both about the world of Earthsea, with its evocation of Names and history, wizards and dragons, kings and long-ago promises, and its relation to the 'real' world that the reader inhabits.<br />By the end of this book, Le Guin has managed to tie up many of the loose ends of the Earthsea world, and provides a very satisfying, if apparently irrevocable, conclusion.  The world she has created has been made richer by this final volume. Those who have never entered this wonderful world now have a very complete set of works with which to fall in love with, be captivated and charmed by, and old Earthsea fans will not be disappointed here, even as Le Guin's themes force each reader to examine their own place in the world, their own balance with nature and society.	2002-01-17
US	51152905	RJIM1DWUI42RL	0819552836	167782560	Atlantis: Three Tales	Books	4	8	8	N	Y	The Extended Sam	Delany once again has delivered something new and different with these three tales of different Sams.<br />The first story, Atlantis: Model 1924 deals with a teenage Sam coming to New York for the first time in 1924 and details his early experiences and impressions of this modern stand-in for Atlantis (note that Delany was born in 1942). Rife with metaphor and allegory, and told using some post-modern literary techniques including multiple story lines on the same page and marginalized notes,  the defining point of this story is Sam's first trip across the Brooklyn Bridge,  and the poet/writer he meets there (who is possibly an older version of Sam himself?). While not an easy story to read due to its structure, by the end of the story all the various story threads, notes, observations, and characters come together in a defining moment of epiphany.<br />The second story time shifts us to the early fifties, where a middle-school age Sam is introduced to the world of music and art in what was, for that time, a very progressive school. His portrait of what art really is, how its definition has changed, and its importance to himself and to the world is neatly balanced by this Sam's early introduction into the vagaries of sex. Some fine, if brief, character portraits round out this quiet story.<br />The last story deals with a Sam in his early twenties in Greece, and is probably the most factually based of the three stories, given that he has mentioned some of the incidents of this story in several of his other works. It is a very dark and depressing story, and details a homosexual rape and the necessity for one of Sam's lady friends to kill her dog. Some very rough material here that may not be to everyone's taste, but delivered with Delany's typical fine sense of language, pacing, and character.<br />All three tales have much to offer, each in completely different ways, and each presents a different 'side' of Sam. How much is autobiographical, how much is pure fiction is almost impossible to define, but the reader will finish this book with a better understanding of not just Delany but also the entire world and the social interactions that help define what it is to be human.is almost impossible to define, but the reader will finish this book with a better understanding of not just Delany but also the entire world and the social interactions that help define what it is to be human.	2002-01-13

By detailing one man's sliding morals, it holds up a mirror to everyone, as we all have faced similar decisions between doing what is right and doing what is convenient. And facing ourselves can be truly horrifying -- especially when<br />the collective result of everyone's decisions is clearly evident in the ethical morass of today's world, from a President trying to re-formulate the English language to the Enron financial fiasco to wide-spread cheating on exams at our military academies.<br />For this novel Steinbeck decided to remove himself from his normal California setting in favor of the East Coast. By doing so he availed himself of a milieu where tradition and 'old money' set the standards for acceptance into 'society'. Ethan Hawley is a man whose family used to be part of that 'society', but due to bad financial decisions he now finds himself clerking for an immigrant who owns the grocery store he himself used to own. With a wife quietly but constantly chiding him about her desires for a better life, to be able to hold her head up in society, and two kids constantly clamoring for more things, Ethan finds himself at a crossroads between a rigid moral code instilled in him by his aunt and grandfather, and providing a better life for those he loves.<br />Told partially in first person in spare but very effective prose, the road that Ethan spirals down is brilliantly portrayed, from his 'sermons' to the groceries, to his internal 'conversations' with his grandfather, to the seemingly chance happenings and conversations in his little town that spawns an idea and method for robbing the local bank, to his 'dropping a dime' on his immigrant boss, to his betrayal of his alcoholic friend Danny. Each action and decision proceeds logically from the previous one, each one more step down a path with no end, a path which Ethan continues to tell himself that he can abandon with no lingering aftereffects at any time.  Each point is meticulously plotted, with all the proper items set in place before the action, and the choice of time, setting, and materials is rich in irony, a sure mark of an author fully in control of his subject.<br />The ending is deliberately ambiguous. By the time I reached that point I had been so drawn into Ethan's character I found that his final decision was tremendously important to me. Each reader ultimately must draw his own conclusion about what Ethan will do, but regardless of what answer the reader reaches, no reader can remain unaffected by this book, and will find his life richer for having read it.<br />Steinbeck was one of the great American writers. His Nobel prize was richly deserved, and this book, while not as well known as his Grapes of Wrath or East of Eden, is certainly one of the reasons why, rivaling his other works in power and insightful looks at American society, just as valid today as when it was written, and peopled by a very living set of characters.ereffects at any time.

From his early fantasies and science fiction works, to his pornographic novels Equinox and Hogg, to his critical papers that have helped place science fiction on the radar screen of academia, to his extraordinarily structured Dhalgren, each piece of his writing displays his broad erudition, his impeccable sense of language, and a finely honed mind that is not afraid to challenge the accepted and the norm. This collection of essays, reviews, and interviews mirrors this broad range. Like most collections, the quality and style varies considerably, and the average reader may find only a few of these pieces interesting and informative, depending on the reader's own interests.<br />For myself, I found the second section of the book, &quot;The Politics of the Paraliterary&quot; to be the most interesting, with an incisive look at literary criticism as applied to science fiction, and excellent overview of the writings of Zelazny, Varley, and Gibson and what distinguishes their work as 'quality', and some revealing insights about his own works: Hogg, Trouble on Triton,  Mad Man, and the Neveryon series. At places the language used is very abstract, and it helps if the reader is least somewhat familiar with the history and terms of formal literary criticism. At other places, especially in the 'Appendix' to this work, Delany, by providing some very concrete examples and clear explanations, gives the reader a great look at just what it is that 'great' writing is and how it is done.<br />The other two major sections of this work, &quot;Some Queer Thoughts&quot; and &quot;Some Writing/Some Writers&quot; did not interest me as much, at least partially due to the feeling that, in several of the essays within these sections, Delany was writing with an axe to grind (or a compliment to pay to a fellow writer).<br />Those who are interested in understanding both Delany and the world of literary criticism should read this work. Everyone who does read it will come away with a larger understanding of not just writing but politics, life, love, and the world around them.and the world of literary criticism should read this work.

It is instead a vibrant group of stories about some very engaging people, from Malama and Teroro of the early Polynesian settlers, to Abner and Jerusha Hale of the harsh, bitter school of Calvinist religion, to Char Nyuk Tsin and her sons and their sons, a great extended family with tentacles that reach across every business and social circle the islands have. Some of these characters are entirely fictitious, some are amalgams of known historical characters, a few are directly modeled on the individuals you can find in the history books,  but regardless of their source or historical accuracy, you will find yourself totally engaged by them, fighting their battles, feeling their sorrow, enraged by their foolishness and arrogance, crying with their happiness.  And along the way you will find that you have learned a lot about these islands and their history, and will end the book wanting to know more (what has happened there since this book was published in 1959?).<br />Many people seem to find the opening section on the geological history of the islands somewhat dull, but, in showing how the islands took shape via wave after wave of titanic and destructive eruptions, it provides a perfect counter-point to the later sections dealing with each wave of people as they arrive at the islands.  And for those whose impression of this book was formed by seeing the Max von Sydow/Julie Andrews/Richard Harris movie, which was based on only one section of this book, &quot;From the Farm of Bitterness&quot;, you will find that the movie is a very pale reflection of what this book has to offer.<br />If this book has a fault, it is in the constant optimistic outlook that Michener presents, both in terms of history and of people. But is it so bad to look on the bright side of things for a change? I ended this book with tears of joy, and I think you will too., you will find that the movie is a very pale reflection of what this book has to offer.<br />If this book has a fault, it is in the constant optimistic outlook that Michener presents, both in terms of history and of people.

Reading this fairly short, critical, and sometimes hysterically funny essay was an enjoyable experience, albeit I had some major reservations about some of Neal's suppositions and conclusions.<br />Stephenson presents, first of all, a rather simplified version of the history of PC computing world and the operating systems that have helped define and advance (or impede) the development of the PC from something that only a geek could love to a ubiquitous near-appliance. His definition of what an operating system is matches what most programmers, using common sense, would call an operating system: a suite of low level tools that perform the mundane tasks of interpreting what an application wants to do to the physical realm of reading/writing memory, disk files, displaying graphics, etc. This is not a trivial point, as the current insistence by Microsoft that its operating system is inclusive of web browsers, audio/video players, and other application-level programs is a key item in its anti-trust defense.  However, Stephenson bypasses the relevance of this in favor of defining the differences between the MacOS, Windows, UNIX, and BeOS. For this purpose he uses a highly useful (and sometimes funny) metaphor defining each OS as a car dealership, each of whom sells their type of product to a different type of customer.<br />One of his major points is the idea that an OS is a saleable product, even though in essence it is nothing but a long string of 1's and 0's, information only, and not a physical item, represents a paradigm shift, on the order of trying to sell a car's driving interface (steering wheel, brakes, etc) as a product separate from, and having intrinsic value in its own right, the car itself.  Given the obvious nonsense of this separation in the case of the car, he makes the case that operating systems should all eventually be given away free, ala Linux, and that businesses that depend on OS income are treading a very dangerous path.<br />He shows a definite preference for those OSs  that allow the user to 'get under the hood' and tweak its operating parameters, such as Linux, and includes a long discourse on the whole concept of simplified, pre-packaged interfaces as culturally defining/defined, including some good analogies with what Disney does to make complex, detailed subjects immediately comprehensible to Joe Six-Pack.<br />All of this makes for easy, enjoyable reading, whether you are a power user or just someone who wants to send e-mails. But his conclusions about which OS is best and the future direction of OS evolution is definitely skewed towards the power user, someone who is comfortable in dealing with all the inner complexities of computers and software. As such, he sometimes forgets that computers are a tool (even though he devotes a section to different levels of tools in terms of quality , power and user skill levels), of no use to the user except insofar as they provide something that user wants and needs, and it is that end result the user wants, at the absolute minimum of fuss on his part.<br />A thought provoking essay, whether you agree with him or not.hat businesses that depend on OS income are treading a very dangerous path.<br />He shows a definite preference for those OSs  that allow the user to 'get under the hood' and tweak its operating parameters, such as Linux, and includes a long discourse on the whole concept of simplified, pre-packaged interfaces as culturally defining/defined, including some good analogies with what Disney does to make complex, detailed subjects immediately comprehensible to Joe Six-Pack.<br />All of this makes for easy, enjoyable reading, whether you are a power user or just someone who wants to send e-mails.

US	51152905	RQ1IAORDCD5Y5	0553572407	671551230	Interface	Books	3	5	5	N	Y	The Robot President	Interface posits a new computerized device that can be implanted in a person's brain that can help the brain recover from the effects of a stroke by re-making some of the neural connections destroyed by the stroke, with the side 'benefit' of allowing a two-way communication path to an external computer. This device is installed in the brain of the Governor of Illinois, who becomes a Presidential candidate. The story follows his campaign and the slow gain of complete control of his mind by a shadowy Network that financed the research for the device, directed by its media control arm as embodied by a virtuoso of a campaign/advertising manager. As the other side of the equation, another device is introduced, a very much enhanced version of a lie detector that can deliver a person's emotional reactions in real-time to whatever he is experiencing. These devices are given to 100 people who represent a complete cross-section of the American voting public, and their reactions to campaign events allow instant feedback control of what the candidate should do/say to maximize his appeal.<br />The story reads as a high-suspense political action thriller, with a very dark sub-text of there really are powerful, world-spanning conspiracy groups who are intent on molding the world solely to their own benefit. While the prose style is adequate and straightforward, Stephenson's normal cynicism, hysterically funny irony, and satirical stabs at the world are almost wholly lacking here, and the net result is something of a poor copy of a Tom Clancy thriller. Characterization is thin and uneven; even the Governor is little more than a cardboard setup. I felt the final plot resolution was forced, with certain unnecessary elements, and is probably politically impossible, which heavily detracted from his overall thematic message. A great idea, but could have really used the Stephenson we found in Snow Crash.	2001-12-21

Told as a dual time-line story structure, one based on the immediate continuation of our current world (with a large overlap with the time-frame of The Star Fraction), and the other as a (real time) far future colonization of a new planet, united in the person of the protagonist, Johnathan Wilde, the two story lines slowly merge into one coherent whole that provides a good explication of his entire future universe.  And his universe is filled with mind-boggling societies and technologies, from self-aware robots working towards some rights in a human society, to using the resources of Jupiter to build a worm-hole whose other end is literally at the end of time and the universe, to computer entities  (the 'fast folk') originally modeled on humans whose thought processes become so fast that waiting for things to happen in the physical universe becomes excruciating ennui, to a society where murder is punished by fines for the 'lost time'  of the victim until he can be re-incorporated in a new body-clone.<br />But although this book has all these great ideas, I found I didn't like this one as much as the Star Fraction. I think one of the major reasons for this was his depiction of his far-future colony. While several great details were introduced about this society, like the 'abolitionist' movement, an anarchistic and computer aided court/legal system,  a mix of robot and human territorial infrastructures, what was missing was the fact that Wilde does not actually get to 'live' in this society. Instead he spends all his time running away from or fighting his old rival Reid from Earth, and has no chance to do ordinary things on an ordinary day. This made the society too much of an intellectual exercise, and not a vibrant, breathing thing the reader could experience. This same 'distancing' effect occurs with the earlier Wilde's experiences in interacting with the 'fast folk', and the whole rivalry between Wilde and Reid seems to be at the philosophical discussion level, with the effect of their battle on the 'common folk' seen only remotely.  The net effect was to leave me somewhat emotionally disconnected from this book, even though Wilde, Reid, and several other secondary characters are well drawn and potentially emotionally engaging.<br />In short, a book of wonderful ideas that will certainly make you scratch your head and excite your sense of wonder, but not one that will grab your heart or make you long for being born into MacLeod's world instead of your poor, mundane earthly one.with the earlier Wilde's experiences in interacting with the 'fast folk', and the whole rivalry between Wilde and Reid seems to be at the philosophical discussion level, with the effect of their battle on the 'common folk' seen only remotely.

Macleod creates a world where the US/UN is the bad guy, where England is divvied up into many semi-autonomous city-states, each of which have their own idea of what the perfect society should be, and most of whom are at gun-point loggerheads with all the others, where the Net is pervasive and invasive, and may just be the locus of the real world power, a conscious AI, and where your ideas and assumptions about anarchy, communism, socialism, and capitalism will be stood on their head.<br />The main characters of Moh Kohn, mercenary extraordinary, Janice, bio-chemist, Jordan, programmer and rebeller against the purantistic creed of his birth society, and Catherin, idealist and Kohn's former lover, are well realized and interact with each other and the rapidly changing socio-political environment in believable manners.<br />The plot is very fast-paced, almost too much so. At the beginning of the book we are dropped into this wildly different future with very little explanation of where you are or what the overall world picture/history is or how it got that way. The casual reader who is not steeped in science fiction, in being able to accept things as they are presented, and hold his questions in abeyance will probably feel lost and confused. These items are really not explicated in cohesive detail till near the end of the book, with bits and pieces presented all along the way, as the reader is carried along pell-mell through this odd society with each twist and turn of the plot.<br />Stylistically, most of the prose is fairly prosaic, which gets the job done and is normally unobtrusive. Although there is a fair amount of techno-babble, there is very little use of British slang, always a problem for their American cousins to understand. However, the book is littered with typographical errors (the type that spell checkers won't pick up), and this definitely does cause some problems, as you try to determine if Macleod really wrote 'left' instead of 'let'. At a few places, Macleod inserts some sly insider references to other science fiction works and writers - which frequently caused me to have a laughing fit, as the irony used was beautiful.<br />A rich mixture of cyber-punk and politics, a rather terrifying view of a possible future, and strong action make this a page turning mind-enhancing trip through the land of a fantastic and all too relevant tomorrow.nitely does cause some problems, as you try to determine if Macleod really wrote 'left' instead of 'let'.

US	51152905	R1EGKMMPIT95NE	0553293354	834333861	Foundation	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Grand SF in the old tradition	The 'Golden Age' of science fiction  (typically defined as the period shortly after John W. Campbell took charge of Astounding magazine to the late '40s) produced many of the seminal ideas now taken for granted (and almost cliched) by the SF genre. Foundation was certainly part of this era, defining two major ideas: that the entire galaxy would be populated by humans (no aliens around - an early look at the idea that we might just be unique), and that mass human behavior can be codified in mathematical algorithms and to a certain extent is predictable. These ideas, along with several other lesser ones, form the background basis for Foundation, where the galaxy-spanning Empire (closely modeled on the Roman Empire) is in decline and Hari Seldon has created the initial equations of psychohistory, which predict the eventual complete collapse of the Empire and an ensuing 'Dark Age' lasting 30,000 years. Although Seldon can see no way to prevent the Empire's collapse, he does see a way to reduce the resulting Dark Age length to about 1000 years, by setting up a Foundation in the far reaches of the galaxy, whose nominal mission is to preserve man's accumulated knowledge in a repository called the Encyclopedia Galactica.<br />With this as the background, the story revolves around particular points in the Foundation's existence where it is in danger of being destroyed or overrun. Originally written as separate stories, each crisis episode's (all foreseen via the magic of Seldon's mathematics) resolution  progressively moves the Foundation forward from a backwater, isolated, and ivory-tower society towards an active political power, capable of dominating its surrounding stellar mini-empires, becoming an island of light in a sea of darkness and ignorance.<br />Viewing each episode by itself, none of them are representatives of great writing, marred by weak characterization (a typical Asimov failing) and almost hackneyed plotting. The massive shift in viewpoint and background at the start of each episode is also jarring, as the reader must readjust to a whole new set of conditions each time. However, the power of this book and its two successors is in the grand scope of the entire story line, very typical of stories of this era, as they are far more idea centered than character or plot driven.  This book almost cannot be evaluated by itself, isolated from the rest of this set, because the full panorama and scale of the complete story far outweighs the individual contribution of each piece of  it.<br />As an introduction to the Seldon universe, this first book is adequate, with surprisingly little dating, given that the separate pieces of this book were written almost 60 years ago. Yes, there are places where vacuum tubes still reign, but they sit right next to the use of holographic images, which weren't even on the scientific horizon when this was written.  But the technology here is almost irrelevant, as the focus is on how to guide and shape a society of humans, to develop a proper government within which individuals can grow and be creative, while at the same time there is a background thread that asks if all human actions are  pre-ordained.<br />Take the time to read this; ignore some of the blatant examples of '40s pulp-level style. Look instead for the great ideas and their interrelationships; feel the sense of wonder. But to fully experience why this is considered one of the best classics in the field, Foundation &amp; Empire and Second Foundation are immediately required follow up reading.t the start of each episode is also jarring, as the reader must readjust to a whole new set of conditions each time.

But the technology here is almost irrelevant, as the focus is on how to guide and shape a society of humans, to develop a proper government within which individuals can grow and be creative, while at the same time there is a background thread that asks if all human actions are  pre-ordained.<br />Take the time to read this; ignore some of the blatant examples of '40s pulp-level style. Look instead for the great ideas and their interrelationships; feel the sense of wonder. But to fully experience why this is considered one of the best classics in the field, Foundation &amp; Empire and Second Foundation are immediately required follow up reading.	2001-11-27
US	51152905	R1R4D8X0QHZ57U	0553110845	257407410	House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Power Grab	This is the third of the Dune: House books, which as a group make up a major 'prequel' to where the action starts in the original classic Dune. Readers who have not read the original should definitely read that first, else much of this book and its two predecessors will either not make sense or lose their emotional freighting due to absence of knowledge of what happens later to the main characters.<br />The prime focus of this book is the Emperor Shaddam Corrino, flexing his ambitious, if not greatly intellectual, muscle, in an attempt to become the sole ruler of the empire, without the limitations imposed by the noble houses, the Guild, the Bene Gesserit, and the CHOAM regulation of the spice flow. Opposing him in this complex weave of multiple story lines are the Baron Harkonnen, with his own desires on power; Duke Leto, finding his ground as leader and a man of honor; Prince Rhombur Vernius, finally finding his courage and attempting to take back his home world; a world occupied by the Tleilaxu, who are trying to develop a synthetic form of spice. And it is Corrino's dependence on the success of the synthetic spice project that gives him the confidence to take action to consolidate his power.<br />In terms of sheer complexity of story line, this book is as rich as the original.  But as the goal of the major character is power for its own sake, without grounding in any higher 'human' goals, without the rich interplay between philosophy, ecology, politics and action of the original, it cannot achieve the so easily scaled original's heights.  Instead what we end up with is a very good action/adventure story, that does a decent job of filling in the some of the historical and character background for the main story line of Dune, but does no more. In sheer complexity, its very short chapters, and constant point-of-view shifts, it is very similar to some of A. E. van Vogt's better re-complicated stories.<br />Characterization is reasonably well done, but none of the characters is explored in extreme depth, a pity in the case of Duke Leto,  as his character is only briefly sketched in Dune, and yet he obviously had a great influence in molding Paul's character, and knowing him in much greater detail than shown here would have been very nice.<br />This is the best of the three 'prequel' books, a definite page turner (which is hard to achieve when you start off already knowing what the eventual outcome will be), and makes a nice addition to the Dune universe. A must for Dune addicts, others can keep this one for a rainy afternoon's entertainment.haracters is explored in extreme depth, a pity in the case of Duke Leto,  as his character is only briefly sketched in Dune, and yet he obviously had a great influence in molding Paul's character, and knowing him in much greater detail than shown here would have been very nice.<br />This is the best of the three 'prequel' books, a definite page turner (which is hard to achieve when you start off already knowing what the eventual outcome will be), and makes a nice addition to the Dune universe.

Mieville's city of New Crobuzon is a phantasmagorical tapestry of weirdly modified humans, from cactus to bird to frog to ant-men, a technology that is an equally crazy quilt of steam power, magic, electric-powered clockwork for heightened psi-powers,  a political structure that could come straight from Stalin's Russia complete with deals with an all-too-real Satan and a world-thread artist spider known simply as the Weaver, a trash-heap conscious computer, and intimations of a history and wider world that is even more fantastic.<br /><br />Beyond the incredible scenery is an almost Victorian moralistic plot, where the protagonist is forced to deal with the consequences of his innocent-seeming research into methods of restoring flight to a criminal garuda bird-man. His fight against the slake-moths that were inadvertently freed as a result of one of his investigations forms the main story line, and slowly builds to an (almost) exciting story line. However...<br /><br />Mieville's style is very densely descriptive. In the beginning of the book, this is excellent, as it paints a very dark, depressive, intimate picture of the city and its inhabitants. As the plot unfolds and becomes more pressing, though, this same style and repeated images become an obstacle to getting the story told. At the very moments when tension has been raised to high levels, we step out for two to three pages at a time for more descriptions, effectively destroying the pacing of the story.  I think this book could have been considerably improved by some heavy cutting of this material in the latter stages of the book.<br /><br />There are places where the plot could have been tightened. At multiple points, the Weaver saves our hero from impossible situations, an effective deus-ex-machina device as the Weaver can apparently do almost anything (except defeat the slake-moths single-handed).  Although this is consistent with Victorian-era plotting, it really doesn't belong in a modern novel. Thematically the book also falls somewhat flat, with overly simplistic value/action/consequence matings, almost reminiscent of something out of Dickens.<br /><br />A brilliant, off-beat, dazzling setting; an exciting adventure tale; but marred by too many words and too little depth.this is consistent with Victorian-era plotting, it really doesn't belong in a modern novel.

US	51152905	R1BZ6XC7ZVY9M3	0553111248	417245650	Passage	Books	5	63	65	N	N	CQD	Connie Willis has established a fine reputation within the science fiction field for her satires, her mixtures of finely-detailed, fully researched history and the speculative, and her treatment of emotionally charged thematic material. This book is not only no exception, it should enhance her reputation even more.<br /><br />The basic scientific point of departure here is the 'near death experience' (NDE), the 'light at the end of the tunnel' that many people have related in one form or another after close brushes with death. Joanna Lander is investigating the phenomenon from the psychological point of view and Richard Wright from the bio-chemical aspect. Dr. Wright has discovered a chemical that allows the apparent simulation of an NDE, and teams with Joanna as an expert interviewer for his test subjects. Due to a lack of suitable test subjects, Joanna eventually decides to try it herself, starting down a long road that leads by Pompeii, the Hindenberg disaster, the Great Molasses Flood, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, and for a large portion of the book, the Titanic.<br /><br />Willis' main characters are exceptionally vivid. Most of the book is told from Joanna's point of view, and it is very hard not to get drawn in to her slow spiral to near-obsession with NDE's and the Titanic. Maize, a young girl with a major heart problem, will endear herself to you within two pages, possibly because of her unflinching, almost gleeful interest in the most horrible disasters of all time. Within the secondary characters we find all the usual Willis trademark intentional caricatures, from the snake-oil self-aggrandizing Mr. Mandrake, to the super-gullible matron of Mrs. Davenport, to the over-protective mother of Maize, to the over-talkative not-totally-truthful WWII veteran Mr. Wojakowski. These characters are mainly good for sticking pins in, along with some sharp spikes directed at hospital bureaucracies (and hospital buildings!), depicted here as so far removed from reality as to be almost surrealistic.<br /><br />But the satire is truly secondary to the main thrust of this book, which is a real investigation into not only what death is and what may lie beyond it, but what living is all about, even in the face of accident, pain, and tragedy. Along the way are some very interesting thoughts about how long-term associational memory works. The title of this review is an example: I had seen those three letters before, and recognized them the first time I encountered them in the book, but I couldn't remember when or where I had learned about them or what they meant. Later in the book when I saw them in context, I said &#34;That's where I saw them!&#34; (they have to do with some of the messages that were sent by the Titanic). Willis does a good job of explaining why this type of memory problem occurs, and also why certain 'coincidences' seem to occur (numbers players will not be happy with this).<br /><br />True to form, Willis' historical research is impressive, not just about details of the Titanic disaster, but several others as well, and her chapter titles of the last words of famous people are extremely interesting. My favorite was Beethoven's: &#34;I shall hear in heaven&#34;.<br /><br />This book may be just a smidgen less excellent that her Doomsday Book, but both are high powered, emotional looks at the business of both living and dying, at religion and belief, at heroism and banality, and will find a secure lodging in both your brain and your heart.<br /><br />---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)urrealistic.

US	51152905	R93A8YWNXFY0B	0671667033	325405829	The Firebrand	Books	2	5	11	N	N	Amazon Doom	Bradley is a fine author that I normally greatly enjoy, but I find this one of hers has little to recommend it. It is one of her very few novels that is classified as 'general fiction', though why it should so filed seems odd to me, as it is at least as much a fantasy set in historical times as her Mists of Avalon. It tells the story of the fall of Troy, complete with all the characters from the famous Greek epics, the main character viewpoint being that of Cassandra (or, as spelled in the book, Kassandra).<br />For this interpretation, Bradley posits that the Gods and Goddesses of the time are real, and only in very brief points does she give the possible interpretation that they may be merely the inventions of fevered dreams. Kassandra is still the prophetess of Doom, trying to warn all and sundry of her visions, which naturally nobody will take seriously until they come to pass. As an idea for a novel, this seems quite good, but unfortunately the book does not succeed as either an historical novel nor as a fantasy. The mix of the two here is very uneasy, unlike the brilliant job she did with Mists of Avalon. I think my main problem was with the secondary characters - just about all of them except Helen seemed like they were strutting on a stage, mouthing their pre-ordained lines. And sometimes her explanations for the legends, like the Trojan horse or Achilles heel, seem too mundane and matter-of-fact to have spawned the legends as we know them. Worst of all, here she harps on her main theme of independence for women from the tyranny of men, more so than in most of Bradley's books. While this theme is not inappropriate given the subject material, here it was to the point where it was too strident, to where I almost felt I was reading a feminist tract.<br />A good idea, but a flawed execution. Bradley has done much better.	2001-11-12

While written comparatively early in his career (1968), it shows maturity in handling of both language and character. The narrator, the Mouse, is Delany's typical nail biting, one shoed foot outsider from civilization (gypsy like, in this case), who, while intriguing in his own right, makes an excellent contrast to Prince Red, spoiled, rich, and equipped with an artificial hand that he is extremely sensitive about, and Captain Lorq von Ray. The plot is near space opera, with a race to visit a star in the first stages of nova to collect trans- uranic elements, commonly referred to as Illyrion, that are the power basis of the stellar economy, and also the basis for the high level political/corporate battle. Illyrion is also used to power one of the most unique gadgets I have come across in SF, the sensory- syrynx, which can produce music (or any type of sound), moving holographic images, and scents, all under the control of a single player. This instrument figures prominently in the final climatic scene where Prince gets his just dues. The book also introduces the idea of socket inserts in humans, allowing anyone to plug into any machine and control the machine as an extension of his body.<br />But beyond the simple, near-cliched plot line lies a deeper level of meaning, when each of the characters, gadgets, and indeed even the portrayed socioeconomic structure is viewed as a symbol or metaphor for larger items. Careful reading and thinking about this book will reward the reader with some unexpected insights into courage, environment versus heredity, the use and abuse of power, the influence of 'little people' on the course of history, and many other items.<br />His control of language is illustrated by this quote:<br /> He was an old man.<br /> He was a strong man.<br /> As the Mouse pulled his hand to the edge of the table, the derelict lurched forward.

US	51152905	R34PXX2QZYUVRY	0756400341	887751871	The Fall of Neskaya: Book One of The Clingfire Trilogy	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Before the Compact	I have enjoyed Marion's Darkover series for many years, and this book is a good addition to the set. Set during the Hundred Kingdom period, before the Compact of Varzil the Good, this nicely fills in some of the details about this heretofore only briefly sketched period. Here the Towers are under compulsion to produce laran weapons for the comyn Lords they are allied with, from clingfire to bone-dust, weapons of such great destructive potential they frighten all sane persons. Strong parallels are drawn between these weapons and our own nuclear arsenal, and the policy of MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) gets some critical looks.<br />The story line itself is centered around four individuals: Coryn, a Keeper in Training, Taniel, Queen of one of the smaller holdings, Damian, a comyn lord with visions of uniting all of Darkover under his rule, and Rumiel, Damian's brother, a trained laranzu who is obsessed with being able to control his own tower circle.  Coryn and Taniel are very well drawn, believable, and emotionally engaging. Damian and Rumiel are less so, with little real depth and apparently live just to be convenient enemies.<br />Though the general feeling of this book is highly reminiscent of Bradley's methods and style, there are places where Ross' own style shows, most obviously in her descriptive work, especially when describing things like halls and meals, as she has a tendency to paint these items in much greater detail than Bradley. This is not necessarily a negative, as it can provide a better 'picture' of the world of Darkover, but long-time Bradley readers may be a little surprised. But disappointing to me was the actual Hundred Kingdom world that is portrayed. From many of the other works in this series, I had the distinct impression that this period had a much higher technological level than what is shown. Indeed, the society here is still feudal, mainly middle age technology, with the only obvious difference being the willingness to use some of the most dangerous products of laran gifts, and only a short glimpse into the world of actually building and using high level matrixes.<br />Although this work approaches an important theme with high resonance to our world of today, in the end I was left with the feeling that this was a very good adventure story in the classic mode of other Darkover books, but has little more to offer. Still, an enjoyable read, and there are still a couple more books to come in this cycle.the most dangerous products of laran gifts, and only a short glimpse into the world of actually building and using high level matrixes. <br />Although this work approaches an important theme with high resonance to our world of today, in the end I was left with the feeling that this was a very good adventure story in the classic mode of other Darkover books, but has little more to offer.

This book finally fulfills the implicit promise in the title of the first book of this set ,The Gunslinger, that this story would be a marriage of the fantasy and Western genres. The first 100 pages of this are really the conclusion to book III, The Waste Lands, as Roland and company spar with Blaine via riddles both complex and simple, with an ending very reminiscent of a certain Star Trek episode. But the real meat of this book is in the remainder, some 570 pages that detail Roland's first experience as a graduate gunslinger (at the age of 14). Roland and his friends Cuthbert and Alain are sent by their fathers to a remote village, mainly as a method to keep them safely away from the war with the 'Good Man' Farson. But once in the village, the boys discover evidence of a scheme to provide Farson with oil so that Farson can power some of the old military weapons of days gone by and to which the current civilization would have no defense.  Not content with mixing fantasy and westerns, King adds a solid romance to the mix, as Roland falls head over heels in love with a local girl , Susan, who is unfortunately already promised to become the 'gilly' (concubine) of the town's mayor.<br />Along the way to the resolution of this situation, King manages to throw in just about every Old West clich&eacute;, from the clueless mayor surrounded by crafty evil villains to the barroom contretemps  complete with a four-way stand-off to virtuous girl trapped in durance vile to a final guns-blazing battle between our hopelessly outnumbered heroes and the gang. About the only one he left out was the traditional showdown at high noon. Although King is obviously providing a near-parody of these cliches, they come off as very logical, eminently readable elements to a larger story. And the larger story mixes these Old West elements with those of the fairy tale, from the wicked witch (references to both Oz and The Lord of the Rings), to the gallant knights of old (of Arthurian fame), to a truly horrifying  Halloween bonfire. And just for good measure, King throws in complete situations from his own works, most notably The Stand, and a new, updated version of the Emerald City of Oz.<br />By detailing Roland's early experiences through this story, we end this book with a much deeper appreciation of Roland the man, no longer just an embodiment of an obsessive drive to reach the mysterious Dark Tower, but a person who has (had) normal human emotions and conflicts. We also learn a good bit about Roland's world and some of its relationship to our own, things that were crying out for some explanation from the previous three books.<br />The book is an impressive mixture of the common elements of multiple literary genres, skillfully handled to provide an invigorating sense of newness to some very trite story elements. It is not a deep book in terms of theme or philosophical insights, but reads quickly, with lots of action and some very recognizable characters. Still, we must now wait (how long?) for King to finish this very long Dark Tower quest.truly horrifying  Halloween bonfire.

Each episode provides a little more insight into Roland's  fantastical world, both past and present. By the end of this book, a fairly coherent picture of this world emerges, from its obvious high technology past, to its current sadly deteriorated state, to some of the rationale behind why certain things work the way they do in this world. The book is very action oriented; there is very little reflection on grander philosophical themes here, and continuing character development of the main characters is fairly minimal.<br />There is a nice variant on the old time-travel paradox. In The Gunslinger, the boy Jake is sacrificed to Roland's determination to catch the 'man in black'.  In this story, we find Jake alive and well and still living in (our) New York, due to an action by Roland in The Drawing of the Three that caused the previous history to never occur. But both Roland and Jake have memories of the 'other' past, and this duality is slowly driving both to the edge of insanity. The resolution of this problem requires that Jake be brought back to Roland's world, and how this is accomplished forms the major portion of one of the 'episodes'.<br />At various points throughout this book, King makes allusions to other famous science-fiction and fantasy authors and their creations (and some of his own), from Richard Adams (Shardik and Watership Down) to Isaac Asimov's 'positronic' brains of his robot stories, to J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit with its riddling games. For those who have read these works, these allusions provide an enhanced view of this world and how it works, but I am not sure how well some of this plays with readers who haven't read these other works.<br />Overall, this book is a page-turner, and does a good job of holding the reader's interest in the fate of the major characters and the overall resolution of the quest. The ending of this book is a cliff-hanger, like the movie serials of old, and for this reason I don't recommend you start this book unless you have a copy of book IV, Wizard &amp; Glass, handy, as you will definitely want to immediately find out the resolution to the end situation here.For those who have read these works, these allusions provide an enhanced view of this world and how it works, but I am not sure how well some of this plays with readers who haven't read these other works.<br />Overall, this book is a page-turner, and does a good job of holding the reader's interest in the fate of the major characters and the overall resolution of the quest.

It is an extremely complex satirical book, with multiple literary and philosophical allusions and referents, and with attacks and comments on many of the basic tenents of American life and social structure, including sex, love, marriage, politics, government, religion(s), economics, tattoos, art, writing, astrology, journalism, TV, military, inheritance laws, cannibalism, prejudice, prisons, and carnival life. Heinlein's aim was for this book to create questions about all of a reader's basic assumptions, to gore every sacred cow, to upset all the apple-carts. In some ways, he succeeded beyond his dreams, as the book was 'adopted' as their bible by many of the '60s counter-culture movement, even to the point that several churches were established with this book as their basis (most notably the Church of All Worlds). Heinlein himself was rather terrified by this use, as he never intended the book to provide answers, only to force questions.<br /><br />The plot line is fairly simple: A child born to the first Martian expedition, Valentine Michael Smith (\\"Mike\\"), is raised by the Martians and brought back to Earth as a young man, where he receives a rather eccentric education into the ways of man by those who befriend him. Once he feels that he understands humanity,  Mike undertakes to educate humans in the philosophy of \\"Thou art God\\" in such a way that the truth of that statement is a provable tautology. As such, he becomes a self-proclaimed messiah, with the usual fate of messiahs that upset everyone's idea of what is 'right'. But those who have accepted his 'education' will continue on...<br /><br />The book makes heavy use of irony and contrasting poles of thought, such as Mike (the innocent) vs Jubal Harshaw (the voice of experience), the Church of All Worlds (Appolonian) vs the Fosterites (Dionysian), the Carnival (heaven ) vs the Zoo (earth). Most of the character's names are important in terms of their 'meaning', elucidating and enhancing many of Heinlein's points. Due to its structure and theme, this is one of the few SF books that has been subjected to a fair amount of academic analysis, a process that continues to this day. Some critics have gone so far as to say that the book is not science fiction, but rather a modern example of a satire, belonging in the same realm as something like Jonathon Swift's \\"A Modest Proposal\\".<br /><br />This book has contributed some new words to the English language, most notably \\"grok\\" and \\"water-brother\\", and may have the best simple definition of love found anywhere: \\"Love is that condition in which the happiness of another is conditional to your own\\". (Note: this definition appears only in the 'cut' version, apparently thought up while he was editing the original version of the book down to what was at the time 'publishable' length).<br /><br />Although this book reads very easily, with Heinlein's typical unforced, everyday American prose style, the concepts and questions he presents are neither simple nor trivial. Not all of his points are directly explicated - it is worthwhile for the reader to carefully look for some of the hidden, non-obvious parallels and historical referents that are scattered throughout this book. You don't need to agree with all his points, but reading this will make you examine of your own assumptions and beliefs, take a look with new eyes at the world around you, and find your own answers.of All Worlds (Appolonian) vs the Fosterites (Dionysian), the Carnival (heaven ) vs the Zoo (earth).

Each is one of the companions foretold by Walter at the end of The Gunslinger in the Tarot card session. They come from our world of New York City, brought to Roland's world via mysterious Doors. When Roland goes through one of these doors, he ends up inside the minds of these people. As a continuation of the quest for the Dark Tower,  this falls right on the standard formula: 1. Define goal/enemy (The Gunslinger) 2. Gather useful companions (this book) 3. Travel endlessly through many strange and wondrous realms (The Wastelands). Whether the rest of the books in the series will continue on this standard pattern I don't know, but in any case their readability depends far more on King's spin on this type of tale than any specific plot element.<br />King defines his new characters quite well. Eddie especially comes across as a very real person, with perfectly understandable fears and motivations. The Odetta/Detta combination is a little weaker, mainly because as 'halves' of one person each character is somewhat of a caricature. The melded personality of Susannah that appears at the end of the book promises to be a more well-rounded character. But other than these good characters, the book is almost wholly placed in our world. We learn very little new about Roland and his world, and as this was the major attraction of The Gunslinger, I found that I didn't like this one as much. It was also marred somewhat by a set of near-impossible coincidences that weren't really necessary, and the trigger for melding the Odetta/Detta character did not seem wholly believable. The 'lobstrosities' that open the book were different,  but they didn't add anything to the story other than clipping a couple of the Gunslinger's fingers and a toe. This seemed to be merely a plot device to make all the travelling companions crippled in some manner, but so far King has not made much of this thematic idea.<br />Obviously a necessary book in the entire series, with some nicely drawn characters,  but without a lot of the spine-tingling mystery of the first book.his seemed to be merely a plot device to make all the travelling companions crippled in some manner, but so far King has not made much of this thematic idea.<br />Obviously a necessary book in the entire series, with some nicely drawn characters,  but without a lot of the spine-tingling mystery of the first book.	2001-09-28

Even though it is somewhat disjointed and occasionally some of the seams show (The Gunslinger was actually written and published as several short stories/novelettes in F&amp;SF over a several year period), this is an excellent read. In basic format it is a classic 'quest' fantasy (as it should be, being based at least partially on the Childe Roland epic poem). Where it differs, startlingly so, is in its protagonist, a 'noble' knight remade in the image of an impossibly competent Old West gunslinger. Unlike much of the other King material I've read, Roland is almost totally defined as a character by his actions. His decision to remain in a town he knows is a trap (and leading to his slaughter of the entire town), his method of fighting in his 'coming of age' test, his sacrifice of Jake -- each item adds to the defined character, and it is not a very pretty picture that gets painted. At the same time, his very stubbornness and single-minded continuation towards his goal, regardless of obstacles, is a traditional picture of a hero type.<br />The world that Roland inhabits and his 'man in black' quarry reminded me a lot of some of Zelazny's work (like Jack of  Shadows and ...And Call Me Conrad) -- not quite our world, hazy, different, but with some recognizable sign-posts along the way that connects in some form with our mythos/archetypes. In some areas, it's a little too hazy, most especially in not giving the reader a roadmap to the 'rules' that govern his world - we go from everyday 'bullets work like normal' to 'raising the dead' to 'time warpage' without any real guide to what is possible or normal in this world. But the background history he gives Roland is just enough to whet the reader's appetite to look for more pieces to his puzzle world and the reason behind his quest.<br />Overall, not a great work, as while it stands alone, it is obviously only a part of a much larger story, and the disjointedness is sometimes jarring. Still, this is a quite memorable and different story than the average King blockbuster.ifferent story than the average King blockbuster.	2001-09-24

The books main premise of a fight between the transported 'Old World' gods and the new ones of modern urban America is a good one, each fighting for the thing that makes the gods immortal - belief in and homage to them. This war is slowly brought to light as Shadow, the main character,  learns piece by piece about them, through direct interaction and through multiple dream sequences. Shadow's growing acceptance of the weird, different, and (normally) impossible is well handled, carrying the reader along a path from everyday reality to a final acceptance of a truly fantastic world, where our world is in some ways just a shadow of the true reality.<br />Gaimam is at his best in the dream sequences and the short historical interludes that give a proper background to the arrival in America of many of the 'Old World' gods that are interspersed throughout the book. Within these, there is a distinct dark flavor, almost an oppressive depressiveness,  an evocation of the not quite seen. Some of the descriptions of the odd-byway distinctive American tourist attractions are interesting and striking.<br />Where this book fails, however, is in three distinct areas:<br />The first problem is the sheer variety and number of the referenced gods. Most authors working in this area have confined themselves to using gods from only one distinct pantheon (Norse, Greek, Egyptian, Indian, etc). Here, Gaiman has referenced gods from almost every corner of the world. Few readers will have the background necessary to recognize all of these (especially not from the minimal clues Gaiman gives to their identities), and therefore will not be able to add each god's distinctive qualities to the portrayed character, thus making these characters near ciphers.<br />The second problem is very limited character development for anyone other than Shadow and Wednesday (Odin). Even Laura (Shadow's dead wife) and Mr. World (Loki), major players in the final resolution, are given very minimal development, leading to little emotional involvement by the reader in the outcome.<br />The third problem is Gaiman does not give any real 'presence' to any of the 'new' gods; there is no feeling either for or against them, as they nebulous names only ('media', 'credit', 'auto').<br />There are some scenes of rather shocking sex and a rather cavalier, everyday tone to his relating of some very horrific events. These add a lot to the very dark tone that prevails throughout this book, but 'atmosphere' alone cannot carry the full weight. At the end, I was left with a feeling of 'OK, so what?'  An ambitious, interesting concept for a novel, but not totally successful in its execution.(Loki), major players in the final resolution, are given very minimal development, leading to little emotional involvement by the reader in the outcome.<br />The third problem is Gaiman does not give any real 'presence' to any of the 'new' gods; there is no feeling either for or against them, as they nebulous names only ('media', 'credit', 'auto'). <br />There are some scenes of rather shocking sex and a rather cavalier, everyday tone to his relating of some very horrific events.

With each new book in the series, new aspects of Ryan are displayed, from his own internal doubts about the moral correctness of some of his actions to a dazzling display of competence in each endeavor that he attempts. Here we find Ryan involved, as a first order plot, in an economic war with Japan, waged with all the tools of modern electronic markets, where Ryan's prior experience as a Wall Street analyst is useful, believable, and comprehensible to the reader. This alone is no small feat for Clancy, as Wall Street jargon is a language all its own, and the internal workings of the markets are mainly a dark mystery to most. Of course, this being a Clancy novel, there is far more than just one main plot, and when things deteriorate to a shooting war, he does his fine job of delineating actual tactics, weapons, squad level and executive decisions to the point of making the reader feel that he is there on the front line. The characterization of Yamata, one of the main driving forces on the opposing side, is very well done, and lends a sense of inevitability to the surprising and traumatic conclusion to this book. After reading this, Executive Orders is a must read, if just to find out &quot;Now what?&quot; (and you won't be disappointed, as Executive Orders is as good or maybe slightly better than this one).<br />There are a few places where I felt Clancy could have been more concise; at times the level of detail he throws at the reader is overwhelming, and not truly necessary to developing his plot, characters, or theme. This is a typical Clancy failing (which seems to have become much worse in his latest couple of novels) -- here it is quite bearable, and it is fairly easy to recognize those sections where it is safe to do some skim reading.<br />Some readers of this have felt that the depicted scenario is too far out, that this could never happen in the real world. This is not a failure on the author's part, but rather the failure of too limited an imagination on the part of these readers. Events as they have occurred since this book was published in 1994 have, unfortunately, shown just how possible this kind of thing is, if not exactly right in all its details. But it is clear that America can be attacked in many more ways than the traditional military methods, from economics to bio-war to terrorists. How we can maintain our traditional freedoms while nullifying these threats is a continuing question that so far does not have any simple answer.uthor's part, but rather the failure of too limited an imagination on the part of these readers.

Instead you'll find a superb tale of faerie, music, and romance. Emma Bull and Steven Brust (also a well known fantasy author) were at one point two components of the band Cats Laughing, and Bull uses her musical knowledge and experience to great advantage here. Her descriptions of practice sessions and performances will resonate with any music fan, and she skillfully weaves this into a major component of her tale of Eddi, selected by the Seelie to invoke the boon of mortality on the battles of the faerie world.  To protect Eddi until the time of the battle, a phouka is assigned to guard her, at times a formidable dog, at other times a whimsical human trickster. Though quite predictable, there is a slowly building romance between the two, and this defines both characters to a depth that is rare in fantasy, as each impacts on and reacts to the other, and wind their way into the reader's heart.<br />The world of faerie is seen at a distance (even though the major characters are directly involved in some of the faerie battles), never fully explained or examined in detail, and this very indistinctness adds flavor, a bit of mystery, and charm to what is really a story of and about some of our deepest emotions. The final battle between Eddi and the Queen of Air and Darkness is extraordinarily different, drawing on the 'magical' emotional state that sometimes occurs between the makers and hearers of music, rather than swords, spells, talismans, or some hidden bit of arcane knowledge so common to the climax of most fantasy.<br />Different, powerful, skillfully told, this book is a charmer.	2001-09-06

A three-ton overgrown caterpillar who just loves to munch on the neighbor's prize rose bushes, add a few pieces of tasty metal cars, and raise John Thomases. Of course, John Thomas doesn't quite see things the same way as Lummox. When Lummox goes on a little trip through downtown, with the expectable result of absolute mayhem, John Thomas finds himself in trouble with his mother and the law with only his girlfriend to help him.<br />.<br />How John's problems are resolved is an exposition in a teenager's maturation along with a very different (for Heinlein) portrayal of a truly competent and efficient government bureaucrat (for a completely opposed view of civil servants see his Friday or Stranger in a Strange Land). Along the way, Heinlein makes points about child rearing, the sometimes ridiculous workings of the law (along with some hilarious courtroom proceedings), prejudice, advertising/political campaigns, the shortcomings of making unfounded assumptions, self-blinded egotists, and the right of self-determination, all buried inside a fun and very good adventure story.<br />.<br />Heinlein never wrote 'down' to his readers, one of the aspects that make his so-called juveniles so enjoyable for readers of all ages. Some younger readers may have a little trouble with the vocabulary he uses, though the meanings of his word choices are almost always inferable from the context. My 12 year old, who is currently reading this, runs into an unknown word about every two pages. While this is slowing him down a little, it is not detracting from his enjoyment of the story (and whether he knows it or not, he is learning a considerable amount from this book).<br />.<br />Character development is a little sparse and the story line is comparatively simple. This is not the best of Heinlein's young adult books, but is a very entertaining and enjoyable book.	2001-09-04

(And Who Knows What Will Happen)	This, along with Tunnel in the Sky, gets my vote as the best of the juvenile (YA) books that Heinlein wrote. As usual, calling this a juvenile does it something of a disservice, as the book is fully readable by anyone from ten to ninety year-olds.<br /><br />Kip Russell is not your typical teenager - he's not only quite intelligent, he's resourceful, honest with himself, goal-directed, and not only has dreams but realizes that it takes work to make those dreams a reality. One of those dreams is being able to take a trip to the moon, and as the family finances (clearly visible in the basket his father keeps for income) obviously won't provide enough for such a trip, he decides to enter a contest where the first prize is such a trip. But he doesn't just send in one entry and hope that Lady Luck will smile on him - he works at it, eventually sending in several thousand entries, each with a different slogan for the soap company sponsoring the contest. Does he win? No, but he does get one of the second prizes, a real, honest-to-god space suit. When it arrives, Kip sees that it is not in current `space-worthy' shape, a disappointment - but he methodically sets about correcting the deficiencies in the suit, till he finally has something worthy of the name.<br /><br />Up to this point, this is something that could happen in the everyday world - but now Heinlein throws in a whopper of a `coincidence' (a coincidence that couldn't have happened unless Kip was prepared, Heinlein's point) - while testing his suit, calling out on the built in radio, Kip gets a reply, not from some passing airliner, but a real, live UFO, piloted by, of all things, a twelve year old girl, Peewee, and with a truly alien passenger, the Mother-Thing. From here, things develop rapidly, leading to the Moon, Pluto, the Greater Magellanic Cloud, and `Wormface' villains, with many an adventure and `miraculous' escapes, and with the fate of not just Kip, Peewee, and the Mother-Thing hanging in the balance, but the very existence of Earth.<br /><br />Heinlein's craftsmanship shines throughout this book. His characters are well developed  - the depiction of Peewee as an obnoxious-but-lovable prodigy is superb, the Mother-Thing will live long in your memory, Kip is very easy to identify with, and it is very instructive to see how he changes during the course of the book. The situations Heinlein places them in all develop logically, and the scientific details he throws in are very accurate. Here we find the description of the design, capabilities, and deficiencies of the space suit - remarkable close to today's suits (though not really surprising, as Heinlein was involved with some of the engineering research into high-altitude pressure suits during WWII), written in such a manner as to remain totally engrossing - one of Heinlein's great talents, as few could write about such things without boring the reader to death. Calculating the travel time to Pluto at a constant boost is not only accurate, but helps highlight another part of Heinlein's message on the value of education and confidence in one's own abilities, as Kip performs this calculation in his head, without recourse to his slide-rule (yes, that's dated, but is immaterial to the point raised).  The prose style is typical Heinlein, easy, Mid-West folksy, and there is quite a bit of ironical humor suffusing this book. Of course the title is a take off on the TV show Have Gun - Will Travel, which young readers today will have never heard of, but it was a pretty good show in its day, and many of the personal qualities of the Paladin of that show are highlighted within this work.<br /><br />Heinlein never seemed to have very `villainous' villains, and the Wormfaces and their human accomplices here are no exception, but the reason for this may just be (in Heinlein's view) that those who would commit crimes against others are people (or aliens) that have regard only for themselves, are out to satisfy their own desires without regard to other's rights or for any larger purpose. Heinlein's outlook on such people is that they are necessarily weak because they have no inner compass, no internalization of the benefits of the society they live in, no guiding light beyond themselves. Heinlein hammers this point home in his depiction of the human accomplices here, showing them to be remarkably stupid in an area that really counts - what makes life worth living.<br /><br />As usual in a Heinlein novel, he presents some items that will make you think. Kip's family organization is not typical, his father's ideas on how to raise a child are quite different from the norm, and his opinions about the adequacy of the public school system will resonate with (or disturb) any parent reading this. Kip's father's approach to income taxes and the IRS should also raise some questions about the proper role of government and just what actions private citizen can or should take when dealing with such entities. Whether mankind as a species `deserves' to survive, given our violent and bloody history, whether our trait of stubborn determination in the face of overwhelming odds is a good or bad thing, whether the seemingly ever-increasing rate of technological development will help us or eventually overwhelm us if not balanced by a concomitant development of ethical standards that are actually adhered to by all come in for a telling examination.<br /><br />A grand, rollicking read, fun for everyone, with a lot of heavy-duty philosophy lying just under the hood<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)desires without regard to other's rights or for any larger purpose.

Doing this with any Heinlein novel is dangerous; in short order I was snagged into re-reading the entirety of this one.  Heinlein has often been cited by many of today's scientists and engineers as their inspiration for getting into the sciences, and this book is a prime example of why. As the story of Matt Dodson, young man in training to be a Space Patrol officer, it is a very typical adolescent-to-man portrayal. The first half of the book deals with his training, from the rigorous testing to eliminate those who don't have what it takes to descriptions of the myriad of subjects an officer is expected to know. The second half details his experiences and on-the-job training as a school graduate, from long boring hours in space transit, to the finding of a missing Patrol ship, to his experiences in the art of negotiation with Venusian natives.  At no point does this book ever become boring; I fully believe Heinlein could have written a twenty page exposition on watching grass grow and kept his readers totally engrossed. Some of the details he presents on the art of astrogation and space flight may go over the heads of some younger readers of this book, but it is precisely such details that will get those readers interested in studying such subjects.<br /><br />This book was written in 1948, and some allowances must be made for that reason, such as the description of Venus as mainly a hot and very wet but habitable planet (at the time he wrote this, this was one of the main scientific suppositions about conditions on the this planet). At the same time, it is quite incredible just how accurate he was in describing everything from rocket ship design, fuels, space walks, space sickness, space habitats, eating utensils designed for space use,  the utility of a global peace-keeping force (such as the U.N., which was just being formed when this was written), and even predicted the use of microwaves for cooking (this prediction is hidden in a throw away one-liner comment, typical for Heinlein, as he quite correctly portrays the inventions of the future as mere commonplaces of their time).<br /><br />Some have called this a watered-down version of Starship Troopers, and there is some validity to this point, as there is very little of the heavy philosophy that characterized Starship Troopers here (although, like all of his 'juvenile' novels, there are strong threads running throughout on the importance of honesty, duty, personal responsibility,  and the proper role of government), but much of the same flavor regarding military organizations.<br /><br />Other than Matt himself, the characterizations are somewhat one-dimensional, in some cases near caricatures drawn with broad strokes. This is not necessarily bad in a book intended for young readers, who have not yet reached the sophistication to see the world in many shades of gray, but is a little grating for the adult readers. The depiction of Burke, supposedly good enough to survive all the testing and early training for the Space Patrol,  but so dunderheaded as to effectively kidnap a local Venusian 'mother' and not see anything wrong with his actions is especially grating.<br /><br />This book was the basis for an attempt at a TV serial: Tom Corbett, Space Cadet in the early fifties, and is very well suited to this type of treatment.

This one is told from the viewpoint of a Terran observer on a newly opened for contact Hainish world, and much of the novel is strictly her observations and thoughts on these matters, with little action and a lot of philosophy. She draws clear parallels to the Chinese cultural revolution and to the forceful subjugation of Tibet, while taking some digs at the sometimes mindless material obsessions of capitalistic societies.<br /><br />Being told in first person, there is little apparent development of other characters besides the protagonist, and the dry, almost academic tone and spare language of the first three-quarters of the book can make for difficult going. Somehow, though, by the end of the book, I found myself totally engaged with her protagonist, with a clear picture of not only the society but also her secondary characters. The resolution requiring action on the part of her observer seemed very appropriate, the observer affecting the observed and vice versa, becoming caught in a web of personal responsibility until she can no longer be a just an observer. In some ways this one reminded me of Pangborn's Mirror for Observers.<br /><br />This is not quite at the level of The Dispossessed, and it probably should have had a greater length to allow for better character development, but still a very good exposition, with more depth than one would expect in such a short work.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)	2001-08-30

It covers the history of Israel from the War of Independence of 1948 through the Six-Day War of 1967. Unfortunately, this read far more as a non-fiction work describing each battle than a fully formed fiction work. I think one of the main reasons for this is that the Arab viewpoint is never presented by any fictional character, only the public pronouncements of the various Arab leaders are presented. This meant that all the action is focused on an enemy with no face, no heart, and no body, so it is difficult to become emotionally attached to it. Michener's The Source did a far better job here, getting into the detailed history and motivations of both sides, and making you see how the current situational mess came about and the obstacles that are still facing the people of the region.<br />The characters that Wouk does present here are competently drawn, but they don't reach down and grab you in any emotional manner. He does handle the problem of inserting fictional characters into known historical events reasonably well; one never feels a jarring sense of non-believability in his situations or characters. One aspect that is well done is his depiction of the American Jewish society, with its unrealistic expectations and little knowledge of the true state of affairs within Israel. But overall, this work is not at all up to his prior standards.	2001-08-28

Hal Clement practically defined the sub-genre of super-hard science fiction with his Mission of Gravity in the '50s. This book continues in that tradition. Still River is based on real scientific facts that you can go out and verify in your local high school science lab. It takes Jules Verne's old story of Journey to the Center of the Earth and creates a world where you really can travel to the center of the planet. For this purpose Clement assembles a group of very varied alien beings and one human, students sent on an (ostensible) assignment to the planet Enigma 88 to determine how such a small planet has kept an atmosphere. The story revolves around their various misadventures as the planet keeps upsetting all their assumptions and oversights, and thereby getting them into deeper and deeper trouble. A very good science puzzle story (and it really helps if you have a pretty good knowledge of inorganic chemistry under some fairly extreme conditions). The characters are not very well realized (though better than in some of Clement's works); this is a typical failing of his. But at least the portrayed motivations and modes of thought are logical and consistent for each type of being. Not up to the standards of Mission of Gravity or Needle, but entertaining.

This story has only a little of the fantasy elements of Mists of Avalon, and doesn't detail all the gory politics and wars of Rome of that period, but is rather a very personal look at this period of history, showing how her own personal thoughts, desires, and beliefs helped mold the political world of day, and the world event's effects on her.<br /><br />The major portion of this still deals with one of the main themes of Mists: the conflict between the burgeoning Christian religion and the older 'pagan' ones, both Roman and British. Helena herself finds a synthesis, that there is one 'Great Being', that humans, in their limitations, cannot fully see, and therefore worship many aspects of this being, all valid in their own way.<br /><br />Helen is well drawn; it is easy to become emotionally attached to her hopes and fears. The rest of the characters are not as fully realized, but still far more than cardboard. The strident feminism that marks much of Bradley's later works is very quiet here, only appearing in short thoughts and asides. But I think that if the reader does not have at least a passing knowledge of this period in history, some of the thematic power of this story will be missed. Things like the Council of Nicaea are treated as an offstage happening, as are many other events. This lends a certain distancing effect upon the reader; Helena's world seems not quite connected to the world at large. Some more direct exposition of some of these events would have helped this novel. Also, place names are consistently given in their Latin version. While a cross reference is provided, I think this was a poor decision; the modern Anglicized names would have provided more immediacy to the work.<br /><br />Still, a reasonably strong work, not as powerful as Mists, but an interesting prelude to the situation that Mists starts from, and providing a very different look at an important historical person that few people are even aware of.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)Still, a reasonably strong work, not as powerful as Mists, but an interesting prelude to the situation that Mists starts from, and providing a very different look at an important historical person that few people are even aware of.    --- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)	2001-08-25

This book has none of fun, helter-skelter pace of her Chanur novels, nor the philosophical and political depths of her Cyteen, nor even the fascinating alien cultures of her Faded Sun books. Instead, we are treated to three separate treks across a desert, with a culture that could be lifted directly from the Bedouins of Arabia, complete with clearly recognizable camels and nomadic tribes.<br /><br />The elements of the story that could be interesting, the vermin, the city culture of the Ila, the nano-technology itself, the actual picture of the destruction of the hammerfall, are all off in the deep background, beyond the real understanding of the main character Marak. In addition, there are at least three major logical holes in the plot. The first is the use of the tribesmen, traveling by foot, to convey a simple message between two star-travelling level entities (surely there are faster and more precise methods to communicate). Second is the constant mental 'voices' heard by the 'madmen'. While these voices and visions made a little sense at the beginning, after Marak meets with the Luz, they no longer serve a warning function, but instead become a major interference in allowing Marak to accomplish his given task of leading the world's people to sanctuary. Why would Luz continue this form of 'communication' in the clear face of its detrimental effects? Third, the 'sanctuary' itself. No explanation is offered for how this one area of the world can be kept safe from the climactic events of the hammerfall, which at the least would cloud the atmosphere for years with high level dust, interfering with any crop growing anywhere on the world.<br /><br />This is apparently the first of series of works in a 'Gene Wars' set. Hopefully succeeding books will bring more explication to high-tech cultures behind the founding of the world in Hammerfall, and a return to Cherryh's usual attention to detail and careful plotting.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)Shepherd (hyperpat)	2001-08-24

In this case, it seems almost criminal that this book is barely remembered and has often been out of print, as it is one of the best of the post-apocalyptic books ever written, ranking right up there with Walter M. Miller's A Canticle for Leibowitz.<br /><br />Davy, at the beginning of the book, is a randy teenager just coming into his manhood. Bonded out as an indentured servant to a tavern from the orphanage where he spent his early years, he chafes under the yoke of his status and dreams of better things - including bedding the tavern owner's daughter. In many ways, he's a typical teenager, worried about the mysteries of the opposite sex, status and racism, what the purpose of life is, and feeling that the adults around him are stupid and out of touch with the world. The world he occupies is one that is (very) slowly recovering from the holocaust that has destroyed our civilization, where what is our New England area is now split up into several nation-states, frequently at war with each other, and where the Holy Murcan church is, in many ways, the actual ruler of the territory. When Davy runs away from his bond-servantship, he starts on a journey of discovery, mainly about himself, but also about the ways of humans and the world at large. During his journey, he finds himself involved in the dirty nastiness of war, finds a lady (Nickie) he can totally immerse himself in, and is dragooned into becoming (briefly) a member of a new intellectual renaissance and a political leader.<br /><br />Davy is exquisitely drawn. This is a person with thoughts and opinions that are immediately recognizable, from his ruminations about the causes of war and who fights them, to why people allow themselves to be led by leaders who are no better than tyrants, to questions about the validity of gods and the strictures of organized religions that always seem to prohibit those activities that are the most pleasurable in life. Recording his thoughts and experiences much later in life in a diary, he finds himself pursued by footnotes from his wife and best friend, footnotes that do much to illuminate both Davy himself as others see him and the world at large (and some of those footnotes are hilariously satirical and funny). He's not a world-saver, his actions won't turn the world upside-down by tomorrow, but bit by bit what he does really does have an effect, one that is quite visible by the book's end - an end that just might leave you with a strong case of melancholy tears.<br /><br />In many ways, this book is reminiscent of Huckleberry Finn and Twains' acerbic comments on society and the foibles of humans, with a large dash of spice thrown in that might have come directly from Henry Fielding's Tom Jones - and in quality this book may be a match for those classics. Pangborn's prose style is near poetic, words so well arranged that the environs and situations are immediate and close, marvelously enhanced by both humor and pathos. His insights into the role of religion in everyday life, of average people coping with the vagaries of life, the stupidity and necessities of politics, war, and most especially just what love is and how it can transform a person's life, are clear and both well presented and well thought out. Emotionally satisfying, this book will make you think, and perhaps will change your own outlook on just what the purpose of living is. Nominated for the 1965 Hugo award, for my money it should have been the hands-down winner.<br /><br />Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)hat are the most pleasurable in life.

In some ways this may be the ultimate `disaster' book of science fiction, done with impeccable attention to science, and a very plausible (at the time it was written) setting.<br /><br />The Selene is a rather unique ship, built to travel on surface of a lake composed of nothing but dust, the end result of billions of years of slow erosion of the Lunar surface by continuous heating/cooling and the impact of meteorites. When this book was written (1961), this was a very plausible hypothesis, and is still not completely out of the question for isolated areas of the moon that we haven't explored yet. Due to a rare large moon-quake, the ship, and all its passengers, is suddenly buried some 50 feet below the surface, totally cut off from the world.<br /><br />The story revolves around what four separate people do about this situation: Harris, Selene's captain; Lawrence, the engineer in charge of the rescue effort, Lawson, an introverted astro-physicist who reaches the limelight due to his involvement in initially finding the crash site, and a reporter tracking the greatest rescue attempt ever.<br /><br />For Harris, and the other twenty people trapped in the ship, we see not only a reasoned response to the disaster, but a calmness and degree of civility between the people that might seem, at first glance, to be unrealistic. But when you look at the actual response of many people in similar disaster scenarios (think the Titanic), what is portrayed here is actually quite probable. The character sketches of the passengers cover a pretty wide range of personality types and professions, and add strong elements of believability and relevance to the story. Harris's growth as an individual and his involvement with the ship's stewardess are, perhaps, a little weak and clich&eacute;d, but the general interaction of all the trapped people provides its own level of suspense to the story.<br /><br />The real story, though, lies more with Lawrence and the problems he faces in figuring out how to perform this rescue in such a hostile environment - and it's not just one problem, for it seems as soon as he figures out a way to handle the current crisis, new problems emerge. Each problem clearly derives from real science, and the whole thing is carefully plotted to keep the suspense alive.<br /><br />I guess this book was somewhat ahead of its time, as Hollywood never picked up on this book. Or more likely, Hollywood didn't know what to do with a science-fiction concept grounded in real science (never Hollywood's strong point), even though the basic plot seems like it was just tailor-made for screening. So all we have is this taut, suspenseful  book, very unique within the science-fiction world.<br /><br />---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)ith Lawrence and the problems he faces in figuring out how to perform this rescue in such a hostile environment - and it's not just one problem, for it seems as soon as he figures out a way to handle the current crisis, new problems emerge.

It is a great mixture of adventure, humor, politics, technology, some thought provoking looks at alternate types of marriages, and the most lovable sentient computer ever to grace the pages of a novel. Mike (the computer) is really the star of this book, from loving to tell jokes, to deciding to help  a group of revolutionary-minded Luna 'citizens' actually accomplish their  dreams of freedom because the human interaction would keep him from being lonely.<br /><br />Along the path to revolution, Heinlein, (as usual), inserts thoughts and ideas that challenge your basic assumptions about what is right, normal, necessary, or appropriate. Is a representative democracy the only 'good' form of government? What's so sacred about a 'majority'? How should a government finance itself? (Maybe make the representatives pay for their pet projects out of their own pocket - taxes not allowed!). Are polygamy, polyandry, or other forms of multiple marriage wrong or can they be used to help preserve the stability of a child-rearing environment? How do you most efficiently organize a revolutionary group that must be kept secret from the authorities (given the assumption that there will always be 'stool pigeons')?<br /><br />Some have quite correctly noted that this book should not be read by ultra-grammarians, as it is told in first person Luna-speak, an odd pidgin mixture of English and Russian, with occasional items thrown in from Chinese, Finnish, and several other languages. Far from being a detriment, I consider this to be a great accomplishment. Most writers have trouble accurately portraying the dialect, say, of the Deep South in a convincing manner. Here, Heinlein has created his own dialect of the future - and makes you believe it.<br /><br />This book is not quite as deep as Stranger in a Strange Land, one of Heinlein's other great books, but it has a faster, more action oriented pace, and characters that you will get emotionally involved with. I cried at the end of this book the first time I read it (and the second, and the third...) and I think you will too.

But I couldn't finish it then, it just became too obscure and without point. Recently reminded of this book , I realized I was still irritated by this failure (surely it had to be a fault with me, not such a great writer), so I sat down over the last several days and read it, cover to cover. Net result:<br /><br />a. The book is not SF. It may not even be fantasy (although there are certain happenings within it that would certainly place it in the fantasy realm, such as two moons showing up for just one night -- this is Earth). Perhaps it belongs with certain works by Kafka.<br /><br />b. There are important themes that Delany addresses in this book, such as the mutability and slipperiness of time, how each individual experiences time differently; some long polemics on the art and purpose of writing; some decent commentary on 'proper' social mores and how they come into being; how gods are made.<br /><br />c. Unfortunately, items in (b) are buried inside an almost impenetrable fortress of non-plot, asides, deliberately mixed up time order of events, a confusing cast of characters (some of whom you don't learn who they are till after they have already performed important actions), double side by side stories (on the same page), and a whole raft of symbols and metaphors that he deliberately leaves few clues about what they are supposed to represent, non-closure of what is the apparent main story, occasional use of stream-of-consciousness (with no warning about transition from normal prose), etc, etc, etc.<br /><br />d. This book is  dense. It took me almost twice as long as normal to read than the equivalent number of pages in a normal novel. Also, come armed with a good dictionary -- while most of the prose is simple, occasionally, especially when he seems to be speaking ex cathedra , his use of very uncommon words becomes spectacular.<br /><br />e. The language, as usual for Delany, is compelling, beautiful, near-poetry at times. His characters (those that he actually develops) are very different (and intriguing) from the norm (also normal for him). The failure here is the construction of this work. Too much of it is non-linear, snapshots unconnected to each other, logic totally discarded. While this may have been exactly what he intended, it leaves the reader with no focal point from which to appreciate this work.<br /><br />Conclusion: read at your own risk.

US	51152905	R2SOGI2JYX8ZEK	0553203053	44332942	White Lotus	Books	5	74	76	N	N	A new visit to an old friend	I first read White Lotus by John Hersey when it was published in 1965, when the civil rights movement was a very hot topic, and I was just 17, an age when social (in)justice seems to be the only thing worth fighting for. At the time, I thought it was a truly excellent book. So I decided to read it again, here in my old age, just to see if my youthful evaluation would hold up.<br /><br />First off, I'm not really sure in what category this book should be placed. It's nominally an alternate history story where China(?!) won WWI (? - it's only referred to once as the 'Great War', and other internal evidence places the start of the story somewhere in the early '20's). But in many of its aspects, I think it might be better to treat this one as an allegory, in the vein of Orwell's Animal Farm. In any case, the story traces the life of a young American girl who, along with all the rest of her village, is forcibly kidnapped by a version of the 'Mob' and sold into slavery in mainland China - the pre-Communist version of China, which in the '20s had seen very little of technological progress, a society that had changed very little in the prior 1500 years.  Upon reaching China, the story follows White Lotus (her Chinese name) as she is transferred to various owners, starting with a near-upper class mandarin, to a 'mid' level plantation owner, to a poor cotton farmer, to 'freedom' as she escapes to a province that has outlawed slavery, but finds herself just as desperately bound by her limited job opportunities, to life in a 'free' white community where the 'yellows' still own all the land so her only choice is to work as no-hope share-cropper, to industrialized life in the big city, where job choices for whites are still very limited, and finally as  a civil rights agitator/activist. With each change of locale, White Lotus becomes attached to a local strong man (Nose, Peace, Dolphin, Rock), each of whom is the personification of a possible 'answer' to life as a slave/dis-enfranchised minority (become totally worthless, give the owner no value for his slave; stage an armed revolt; run to 'freedom', try to build a life based on self-respect and inner fortitude), each possible answer is demolished by the events as they unfold (executed for supposedly starting fires in Chinese houses; revolt is crushed and leaders executed; runner is caught and ripped apart by dogs; each attempt at building a better life is met by impossible economic demands and job restrictions till there is no hope left).<br /><br />As you go through the story, it becomes increasingly obvious that Hersey is re-telling the history of the Afro-American in America, from the initial forceful grab in Africa, to the 'genteel' society of the early South, to the heyday of large cotton plantations, to the Civil War and through the Reconstruction era, to the move to urban America and the ghettos, and finally right up to the civil rights movement of the '60s, all compressed into 20 years of White Lotus' life. Along the way, he draws some striking portraits of the reasons for so-called 'black' behavior, of the self-blinding hypocrisy of the 'owners', of each individual's struggle to make sense of life, and grindingly destroying all superstitions, (white/yellow/black), heaping copious quantities of lotus petal dung upon them (and most religious beliefs also).<br /><br />If this book was only an exacting mirror of the White/Black struggle, though, it would not be much more than a well-told polemic. But there is an added dimension here: Hersey's portrait of the Chinese culture. The glimpses we are given (looking at it from the perspective of the very bottom of the society) of this China are impressively authentic. Hersey was born in Tienstin, China, in 1914, spent his first 11 years there, and spent much of his early adult life as a journalist in various places in the Orient, and this experience clearly lands on and illuminates these pages.  And because the Oriental culture really is different, it provides an odd 'side' look at the whole issue, giving it a whole other dimension of realization.<br /><br />And the final 'solution' of his protagonist, her method of finding her own self-worth and a possible better life for all whites, is uniquely Chinese in character -- shame the yellows into recognizing them as human, by imitating a sleeping bird. This portion of the story is told within an enfolding prologue and epilogue that form a complete (and very powerful) self-standing story, including a very recognizable portrait of Gov. George Wallace as a Chinese warlord (though he never speaks a word).<br /><br />There are places where this work drags a bit, becomes almost repetitious, where the parallels he draws are too obvious, and the portrayed horrors of life as a slave never reach quite the depths of despair plumbed by something like Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath, but this is still a very honest, insightful, competent, and in places brilliant work. It will make you think. It will make you drag out your own prejudices and carefully examine them. It will show you that the American way of life is far from the only model for good living - others may be just as valid or even better. I've had this one on my top 50 SF works ever since I first read it -- it remains there.<br /><br />---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)odd 'side' look at the whole issue, giving it a whole other dimension of realization.
