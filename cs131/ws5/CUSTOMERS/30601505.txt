With the identity of her father unknown, a teenage Annunciata heads to the restored court and is quickly enveloped in it's heady atmosphere of love and politics. She is the Scarlet O'Hara of her time, falling in and out of love, marrying in haste, and bearing children with resentment. The search for her father only causes more heartbreak, but Annunciata stands tall and proud through it all. <br />   <br />  This book is packed with people and events, there is never a dull moment. Every member of the family gets a valid storyline, and the time gap from the last book is well accounted for. Once again, the characters are involved in the making of history. The court and fashion of Charles II are brilliantly described. Actual historical figures blend seemlessly with the fictional ones.  <br /> <br />Generations may come and go, but the Morland family remain true to their principles, no matter what the politics of the time. And their careers, love affairs, and friendships show that human nature never changes. For the fan of historical fiction, these books are addictive! <br />	2005-10-11
US	30601505	R2DHI9AKXYENCC	0743227441	512398584	The Other Boleyn Girl	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Fact and fiction blend seemlessly	Most fans of historical fiction are probably familiar with the story of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. His divorce from Catherine of Aragon, and the events leading to Anne's execution have been dramatised many times. But not much is known about Anne's younger sister Mary, who is known to have interested Henry well before these events. <br /> <br />  \\"The Other Boleyn GIrl\\" is told from Mary's point of view, and highlights the cut-throat atmosphere of the Tudor court. Once her family realise that Mary has caught the King's eye, they instruct her on every move, hoping that the king's affection will translate into positions, titles and power. And when Anne eventually fascinates Henry even more, they plainly discard Mary to back her more ambitious sister. <br /> <br />  But the book deals with Mary's feelings as well. We watch her grow from a girl who is married off at 13 to someone she barely knows, to a teenager smitten with the attentions of a powerful sovereign. Eventually she becomes a mother and finds love with a simple country man. But even so, her personal life is forever at the mercy of the changeable court, and so often she must drop her personal concerns to aid her family retain power, a job she doesn't relish. <br /> <br />  Since there is little historical fact known about Mary Boleyn (it isn't even sure when she was born), Philippa Gregory has chosen a protagonist who is involved with interesting actual events, but can be conveniently moulded to fit the form of fiction. So beware, not all you read about Mary and Anne may be strictly true. But the story is constructed so well, and the writing so entertaining, that I wasn't even concerned by the parts I knew weren't correct. <br /> <br />  This is good quality historical fiction which I recommend to any lover of the genre. Enough of the book is based on fact, so the educated reader doesn't feel duped, and the fictional parts blend seemlessly. Not to mention, they make this book a dramatic and entertaining readwhich I had trouble putting down.	2005-09-21

Along the way he escapes from slavery, steals a shipload of \\"Solomons's gold\\", looses it all to a warrior queen and becomes King of an Indian province after a bizarre battle using phosphorus distilled from urine as his main weapon. All before heading for the Americas and the promise of even greater fortunes. <br /> <br />  Eliza, meanwhile, discovers that being a Duchess, wife and mother, need not be a bar to European financial and political intrigue. Her motive is ofcourse, sweet revenge.  <br /> <br />  If you were bothered by the philosophical/theoretical conversations in Quicksilver, these are at a minimum in the sequel. More things actually \\"happen\\". But the plot and characterisation are still brilliantly complex and stay true to the original form. Obviously, don't read Confusion if you hated Quicksilver. But if you were uncertain, ambivalent or even mildly entertained, Confusion will prove well worth it.	2005-06-14

The characters were well rounded, and the historical events delightfully interwoven with their fortunes. <br /> <br />  Unfortunately, the Princeling reads more like a recitation of the Morland family tree than a novel with people and events. Sure, John and Lettice Morland are well described, but it's like they are cardboard effigies. We never really care about them except as just another link in the chain of the family which runs before and after them. Births and deaths are described in succinct, predictable passages. One minute a baby is born, the next, the are married. Then they have children and die in an accident of some sort. This pattern happens to so many of the characters that they no longer seem to be individuals. <br /> <br />  The historical background is pale too. The influential reign of Elizabeth I, the journeys of Francis Drake, the overthrow of Mary, Queen of Scots all happen \\"off stage\\". In the previous 2 books, the characters were actively involved.  <br /> <br />  All I can hope for the next book is a return to the earlier form. Otherwise, I don't see it worth continuing a predictable series written in \\"This happened, then that happened\\" style.	2005-06-14

The cast of characters includes famous scientists (Isaac Newton, Robert Hooke), royalty (Charles II of England, Louis XIV), spies, vagabonds, soldiers, whores and moneylenders. Roughly divided into three sections, the book covers the science, finance and politics of the time through a complex array of events. There is a plot yes, but Quicksilver is not so much a novel as a series of vignettes or scenes, which are used to drive the author's ideas. The characters get wrapped up in the Fire of London, Catholic Kings vs Protestant England, the French invasion of the Dutch, and the intrigue of Versailles. And like in real life, it truly is a small world. Actions by one character have ripple effects for the others. <br /> <br />  This is truly intelligent fiction, not Dan Brown. You will learn, ponder and laugh. Both the writing and the extensive and accurate knowledge base behind it show shades of genius. Admittedly, it helps to have a working knowledge of physics and European history. But all the facts and ideas interlink and can be easily worked through.  <br /> <br />  Quicksilver defies description. It isn't science fiction or historical fiction. It is unique. A work of genius is the only way I can classify it.	2005-03-02

It isn't often that I read a book these days and admire the author for original thinking. Sure, there are hundreds of book delving into the nature of modern relationships, and dozens of others have time travel as a feature. But this is the first combination of the two I have encountered.<br /><br />  Don't be fooled though, this isn't science fiction. \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" is the story of a modern marriage, with many common challenges - lack of money, inability to have children, different backgrounds. And then the fact that Henry (the husband) disappears into thin air at unpredictable moments, returning hours or days later.<br /><br /> The first half of the book describes Henry's visits to his wife when she was a child. As 30-something adult he disappears and encounters a teenage Clare. She has never met him before, yet he knows her intimately as a grown woman. When they finally meet for real, Henry is in his twenties, and doesn't know his future wife at all, but she has spent half her childhood with his older, future self.<br /><br />  In the second half, we see the problems encountered by the couple due to Henry's knowledge of the future, and his unstable existance in real time. The book is written in an easy to read manner and keeps a good pace. The author tells us when and where Henry is at any point in time(and how old he is), but there is a nice challenge for the reader to piece these into the correct order and figure out how things will happen. One of my favourite things was being reminded of fashion, music trends and and technology as Henry travels back. Things that we don't realise have changed, would seem quite obvious going back in time, even to the 90s (e.g. mobile phones, the internet), and the author picks these things up so well, I felt like I was time travelling myself sometimes.<br /><br />If you want a relationship story/romance with a twist, this book is great. Don't view it as sci-fi. The best way to catagorize it would be as an original piece of modern fiction, written for the intelligent reader.riginal piece of modern fiction, written for the intelligent reader.	2005-01-09

You know from the first page who got killed, and who did it. What you will learn is how killing someone can change your perception of everything. <br /> <br />In a private Vermont college, Donna Tartt introduces us to five students, who you've no doubt read about or seen before. They are rich misfits, lacking in parental love, academically brilliant but undisciplined. They turn to their charismatic Classics teacher for guidance, and together form an introspective, elite group. But, as the title suggests, they have a secret, and one of them is threatening to betray his friends. <br /> <br />Enter the poor scholarship boy from California. Seemingly neutral, they confide in him, and together hatch a plan to \\"dispose of\\" the traitor in their midst.  <br /> <br />The rest of the book describes the aftermath of the murder, though not in terms of emotional impact. The words \\"guilt\\" and \\"remorse\\" don't get mentioned. Rather, Tartt cleverly leaves us to percieve these in how the friends behave. We see how they act in the face of a body search, police enquiries, the grieving family. And most importantly, how they begin to treat eachother. <br />In short, the group crumbles and turns on eachother, as none are stable enough to support their friends. This way of \\"showing rather than telling\\" is done brilliantly. <br /> <br /> One things that might have been done better: there is frequent mention of alcoholic excess and drug use. In the beginning, it is supposed to denote the characters as a little bit rebellious, but also that they are really very uncertain of themselves, and need it as a social tool. After the murder, this behaviour escalates. Unfortunately, Tartt relies too much on this device to reinforce their dependent personalities, and lack of coping skills. I got a bit tired of it being mentioned, because it was used in such an obvious way. <br /> <br />Other than that, this is a brilliant description of human behaviour as a mirror of emotions. You will peer past the flawless surface, the cool demeanors that let the characters get away with murder, and see the scaffolding of their entire lives crumble.	2004-12-31

Sure, the concept of a \\"Chosen One\\" of special blood who will right the wrongs of an ancient war isn't new. \\"The Fifth Sorceress\\" borrows many common fantasy ingredients in the plot and characterisation, and is therefore hardly original. But this is a failing of many books in the genre these days, and although tiresome, I can't condemn the book on this alone. <br />   <br />  It is the fact that Robert Newcomb has the writing ability of a sixth grader which will frustrate any reader above a certain level of intelligence. Nothing is subtle or complex, you will not have to surmise or assume anything from what is written. Don't worry, the rules of magic and the history of the Eutracians will be explained in two syllable words at most, and the main facts repeated every five pages in case you had forgotten. The personalities of the characters are reaffirmed in every minor action (even the way they eat grapes), so that we can be sure who is good, bad, wise, ambitious etc. I cringed at the obvious way information was revealed and the characters stylised through their behaviour.  <br /> <br />  On a different note, although the anti-female undertones and graphic violence didn't bother me, if you find these unpleasant, it is probably best to avoid reading the book. And if you must read it, borrow it from the library or get it second-hand. Please don't buy it new and thereby give a message to publishers that it is okay (i.e. profitable) to print poorly written fantasy which insults the intelligence of readers and drags down the reputation of the entire genre.	2004-12-26

But you could say the story slowly changes and the character's relationships gradually evolve, much like in real life. Plot aside, the descriptions of Victorian England are brilliant, from the appalling slums to the genteel houses of the upper classes. The characters are well drawn. We care about them  and grow to love them, despite being shown their unpleasant sides as well. And yes, they are cliched. Sugar is the \\"intelligent whore\\", who reads books in her spare time, and has a head for business. William Rackham, the head of a large perfume company is the self-conscious upper class Victorian, embarrased by his \\"trade roots\\" but self-absorbed and superior nevertheless. Acknowledge that you've probably seen them before in other books, and then move on - they're still absorbing. <br /> <br />The ending, as others have mentioned, is abrupt. If you care about the characters, you may be frustrated not knowing for sure what happens to them. On the other hand, if you put your mind to it, you can see by their personalities, and the way they have changed, what their likely course is. But not knowing for sure.....this was a let down for me, I'll admit. <br /> <br />There are a multitude of themes in this book which can be dissected if you have mind. Victorian attitudes towards the poor, mentally ill, women. The fickleness of infatuation (and it's long term consequences), the unachievable concept of domestic \\"bliss\\", the meaning of parental love. There are shades of Jane Eyre and Dickens, all here for the taking. <br /> <br />Forget the length, the inaction, the cliches and the ending. Just let this book slowly envelop you. You will be absorbed by what it has to offer, if only you look beneath the surface.	2004-12-18

The family is now rife with jealousy and hatred. Paul cannot understand his heir Amyas, and struggles to bond with his illegitimate son Adrian. It is a situation doomed to end in tragedy. <br />  Paul's half-brother Jack and his brood seem to have the happiness he cannot grasp. Nanette, his niece, rises at court as maid to Anne Boleyn.

The Princes in the Tower discusses what happened shortly after the death of Edward IV in 1483. His 2 sons, Edward aged 12 and Richard (10 years old), were next in line to the throne. But before the coronation of the young Edward could proceeded, both he and his brother disappeared in the Tower of London and were never seen again. Their uncle took over the throne to become Richard III. <br /> <br />  Alison Weir delves into a mystery that has plagued historians for centuries. In particular, she sets out to demonstrate that the power hungry Richard III was himself responsible for the disappearence of the boys, and that he gave orders for his nephews to be killed.  <br /> <br />  Ms Weir adequately outlines the history of the royal house of York, including a thumbnail sketch of the preceeding Wars of the Roses (covered in her other book on the topic), and the factions and personalities of the court. She also provides a plausible motive and means for Richard III to murder his kin. Common sense dictates that he was guilty. But that is not the same as historical fact. <br /> <br />  The book is well sourced with as many contemporary and near-contemporary scholars quoted as possible. But it is the way Ms Weir interprets this information that is sometimes frustrating. She has started with the assumption that Richard was guilty and makes the evidence match. The chapter concerning the relationship between Richard III and his niece Elizabeth of York is a prime example. While anyone can guess his political motive for wanting to marry her, there is little evidence to suggest he murdered his wife to \\"make room\\", or that he actually loved her. The suggestion that she herself was infatuated with her uncle is ridiculous - at this stage Ms Weir is simply throwing about ideas, without any quotations or references in support.  <br /> <br />  This book will show you why Richard III probably murderedhis nephews to seize the crown, and proposes how he did it. Certainly my personal opinion was swayed to believe that he did it. Unfortunately, The Princes in the Tower cannot be the definative historical answer due to poor use and interpretation of the sources. Nevertheless, I recommend you form your own opinion. Also, it might be helpful to read Ms Weirs \\"Wars of the Roses\\" first.	2004-11-21

The title of Iain Pears book refers to an ancient manuscript by the philosopher Cicero. This is appropriate for \\"The Dream of Scipio\\", which is hardly a novel in the traditional sense. Rather, it serves as a vehicle for some interesting questions and ideas. Pears introduces 3 main characters - men living in Provence in different periods of history - to explore the concept of civilisation and what it means. To him, it means freedom from the struggle of daily survival, and the time and energy to think, learn and discuss the world. The time periods chosen represent cultures known for promoting such pursuits: the Roman Empire, Renaissance Europe and early 20th Century France. And yet all of these civilisations are under threat at the time the novel is set - through slow decline, invasion by the Nazis or the random scourge of the Black Death. Pears looks at how the three men each weigh up the importance of friendship and human life (raw emotive instincts) against the \\"higher\\" ideals of philosophy based on rational thinking. He shows us that these are not always separate issues, and that sitting on the fence can destroy both. <br /> <br />  While I admired the ideas this novel tried to convey to me, I am not schooled in philosophy and I sometimes found myself annoyed that there weren't any answers to the questions I was forced to ask, and that just when I had worked something out, there seemed to be a contradiction to that very principle (but I guess that's the nature of philosophy). I wouldn't recommend this as a novel to entertain based on plot. It is designed to get you thinking. Be prepared to ponder its precepts long after you finish. <br />	2004-11-01

Their saga spans the centuries and the characters are indirectly involved in the main events of English history. <br />  The Founding describes the beginnings of the dynasty. Robert Morland has made money farming sheep in York. Eleanor is poor, but has powerful relations. Their arranged marriage is not a grand passion, but both work hard to establish their family as one of the richest and most respected in Yorkshire. <br />  Harrod-Eagles cleverly weaves the turbulent events of the Wars of the Roses into the story. The Morlands are not aristocrats, but they choose sides to protect their family and business interests. Their fortunes roll with the highs and lows of the Yorkist cause. <br />  The book is historically accurate, from the dates of battles to the fashions and sheep farming practices of the late Middle Ages. But these do not overshadow the story, which is essentially a well-written family saga. Often this book is displayed in the Romance section of bookstores amongst bodice rippers and melodramatic romances. This is sad, because it is far more intelligent than that. While it isn't too deep and meaningful, this is a nice read which won't make you cringe in disbelief.	2004-10-28

The book begins in pre-revolutionary China, when Wang Lung is a peasant. He is so lowly, that he must beg a kitchen slave for a wife from the rich Hwang family. But he works hard on his land and buys more for security. O-lan, his wife, is industrious and bears him sons.<br /><br />But Wang Lung's life is destroyed by famine. The family are reduced to eating leaves and bark. They sell all their possessions and flee the area, but Wang Lung will not sell his land, knowing that it holds the key to his future. After enduring life in a grass hut and begging on the streets, the family return  and begin the ascent towards great wealth.<br /><br />The change which money brings about in the central character is starkly portrayed. Wang Lung goes from simple farmer with a few main concerns, to a rich lord with changing whims and dozens of family conflicts. His faithful wife O-lan, with her unbound feet and peasant build, is ignored in favour of a young, supple concubine. His sons bicker and know nothing about the land that made them rich.<br /><br />The Good Earth is an engrossing saga of family life in prerevolutionary China. It illustrates the extremes of poverty and wealth, and what they can drive people to do. I highly recommend the Good Earth. It is an easy read, and an educational experience. But above all, it illustrates the values of family and land which were so important in China at the time, shortly to be swept away by the revolution.	2004-07-21

Buck's novel tells the story of the Wu family in pre-communist China. Nobel and respected, they have lived for generations in the same tradition. Madame Wu is the mistress of this household, her whole life spent fulfilling the duties of her sex - ministering to her husband, bearing sons, dealing with servants, maintaining a smooth order in the house. But she is intelligent and deeply emotional, and has felt caged by an existence where everyone else come first. <br />So on her fortieth birthday, Madame Wu decides to \\"retire\\" from her duties, to find time for herself. She arranges matters in the house like pieces on a chess board - procuring a concubine for her husband, and marrying off her children, hoping they will no longer demand her attention. But her retreat brings only emptiness, until a foreign priest enters the house to tutor her son.<br />What follows is not a typical \\"forbidden love\\" story. Instead, \\"Pavillion of Women\\" uses the plot to explore themes of identity, self-love and what our connections with other people really mean. Madame Wu finds that freedom doesn't mean running away from duty. It involves learning to love herself first, setting her spirit free. It is then that she is able to return to her duties with a new sense of content. <br />The conflict between responsibility to the group and personal freedom is played out in the family, as a microcosm of China as a whole at the time. But the issues here transcend time and culture - most of us will be able to relate to them. The book is beautifully written, and I recommend it if you want a story that makes you think.	2004-06-12

These are interspersed with colour photographs of relevant locations (e.g. Alexander Palace, site of the former Impatiev House), which are absolutely stunning purely from a visual point of view. Photos of personal objects that belonged to the family - jewelery, letters and toys are also included. <br />Along with the photos, there is an accompanying text that tells the basic story.  It covers the Romanov saga right from Nicholas and Alexandra's childhoods, to their marriage, children, Rasputin, the revolution and the modern day sequel to their story. It is not an academic work, and the information is broad and somewhat lacking in detail. For information on the last Tsar, there are numerous biographies which would serve the inquiring reader better.<br />But as I said, this is a coffee table book for the lay person.<BR>It is like the &quot;creme caramel&quot; of the Romanov library.

It is a barren place, mainly desert, and water is scarce. But in the sand is a precious spice that controls inter-planetary travel, and everyone wants control. The plot concerns two nobel families, the Atreides and Harkonnens, who fight it out for rulership of the planet. But there is a third, unpredictable force in the form of the native Fremen, who have a plan for Dune all of their own.<br />The story starts quickly, with relationships and loyalties tested as the main characters take sides. There is intrigue, fighting and double-crossing. But after the initial momentum, the plot slows to a crawl. After a narrow escape from death, the main character is exiled, hiding from those out to kill him. He shelters in the desert with the natives, transforming himself into a mystical demi-god to get them on side for the ultimate battle of revenge. There is more talk than action, and the characters spend a lot of time explaining and analysing the planet Dune, and how it determines their own culture and religion. It goes on like this for the next 350 pages.<br />When the final battle comes, Frank Herbert dodges the responsiblity of actually describing it. The preparation is outlined, but then the action cuts off the very moment the forces rush into enemy headquarters. The very next scene is the surrender, the terms and conditions of which are described in exhaustive detail. At this point, &quot;Dune&quot; abruptly ends in a massive anti-climax.<br />Dune is a classic, and as such, should probably be read by any sci-fi fan. However, the book never reaches it's full potential. The themes and plot laid out at the beginning are promising, but they quickly drift into nothingness. By the time you reach the end, you may find that you hardly care about what happens to Dune.	2004-05-03

I used this book for my paediatrics rotation in medical school in Australia, as did many of my colleagues. If you are doing a short stint in paediatrics (2-3 months), this book is short enough to go through cover to cover in that time, while still covering everything you need to know to diagnose and treat children once you graduate. <br />  The book covers everything from neonatal problems to adolescence. Basics like common childhood respiratory complaints are covered, as well as rarer things like neuromuscular and genetic disorders. The chapters are divided into systems: gastroenterology, cardiology, behavioural problems, genital and renal etc. The first chapter is also an excellent introduction to history taking and examination (especially how paediatric examination differs to adults).<br />All the major concepts are presented in a succinct, easy to understand manner. From a study point of view, the book is nicely set out, with lots of photos and coloured diagrams. This book would suit any senior medical student doing paediatrics, and also residents who need to brush up before a paediatrics term.	2004-04-26

With greater buying power and social influence than ever before, they created a lifestyle that still echos in ours today. And they were responsible for that English institution: the Victorian terrace house.<br />  &quot;Inside the Victorian Home&quot; takes us through every room in such a house, and describes not only what happened there, but why. For example, the chapter entitled &quot;The Scullery&quot; outlines the multiple steps involved in doing one load of washing. We also learn how hard it was to keep a house clean in a time when coal dust coated everything, the difference between what boys and girls were expected to learn in the school room, and how the Victorians treated illnesses at home. Many of these are taken from diaries and letters, real life accounts.<br />  But behind all of this domestic detail, the book tells us WHY all of this was so important to the Victorians. It underlines the moral climate of the time: &quot;A man's home is his castle&quot;, and &quot;Cleanliness is next to godliness&quot; - sayings which became the virtues every family strove to display by the way they lived their domestic life. We are told how most of this responsibility fell to women. As mistress of the house, a Victorian wife proved the moral standing of her family not only by the way she behaved, but also by how clean her house was, how she regulated the servants and children, and how she handled the household accounts. All these were just as much expressions of respectability as marital fidelity or going to church. <br />Social changes are also explained to give context to Victorian daily life. For example, dinner was served in courses (entree, main, dessert) for the first time in the Victorian era. This is because servants became affordable for the middle classes, and this was a good way to show them off. Before this, all courses were set on the table at once, and guests served themselves. The social proprieties for engagement, marriage and mourning are also discussed in fascinating detail.<br />Inside the Victorian Home dispels the romantic view many of us have of the era, and instead gives us something real and alive, which we can relate to. Domestic details and social and moral conditions are blended to give an eye-opening account of the time. The book is well written and easy to read. I highly recommend it.	2004-04-24

He can smell a person coming before he can see them. He can pick the constituents of a perfume by one whiff, and their proportions. As if in recompense for this, he lacks most other basic human senses. He does not feel fear, pain, is unable to become attached to other humans, and ironically, has no personal odour.<br />  Thus \\"Perfume\\" tells of Grenouille's attempts to use his sense of smell to make up for what he lacks, particularly the feeling of love. He has been exploited and patronised through most of his life, enduring it only in the knowledge that he will one day be a great, admired man, by creating a personal scent that people cannot resist. And he goes to extraordinary lengths to create this unique personal odour - as the book says, he is a murder. Collecting the personal odours of others and blending them for his own use.<br />And he succeeds. Where before he was not noticed by anyone, now people loose control in his presence. But in the end, what he thought would make him feel loved, only leaves him contemptous of those who are tricked by his scent. <br /> Grenouille is cold-hearted, self-absorbed and has no regard for animal or human life. The violence is not portrayed graphically, but you get the import of it nonetheless. You will shake your head, unable to understand how someone could be so totally devoid of emotion. Seeing murder as no more than picking a flower for a perfume. But in the end, you pity Grenouille, because he failed in elliciting love, which is all he really ever wanted.<br />The book is written in a witty, easy to read style, and most of the content is anecdotes of Grenouille's childhood and working life. What made him want, and need to do what he did. Perfume keeps it's pace well, not flagging, and overall it is a highly highly entertaining, original read.	2004-04-11

Having said that, I think reading Jude the Obscure was a worthwhile experience.<BR>It concerns the young man Jude, stonemason by trade, who dreams of a university education. His hopes and dreams are high at the beginning of the novel. But a series of events ensures that life does not have happiness in store for him. His academic aspirations are thwarted, he marries a vain girl in a moment of lust, and watches his real love - Sue - marry another. When he finally gives everything up, job security, social respect, his ambitions, to live with Sue &quot;in sin&quot;, there is a brief, uncertain ray of happiness on them before tragedy stikes again.<br />The emotions I went through while reading Jude's journey and ultimate disappointment in life were intense. I felt despair, sadness, shock, and was ultimately left feeling quite bitter about his plight. BUT, I enjoy reading books that wrench out your heart and make you feel deep emotion, whether happy or not. Few books do that well in my opinion. That fact that Jude the Obscure did that for me, even though the emotions were negative, was the reason I gave it 5 stars. <br />If you don't like being depressed by what you read, it is probably wise to avoid this one. If, however, you want a truly momentous emotional experience, you should definitely take time to read Jude the Obscure. Just be aware that the feelings it arouses are not pleasant, but it will definitely leave you deeply moved.	2004-04-10

It makes the point that slaves were not expected to have human emotions - especially love. Many times the characters tell of families split up, children lost, until they become afraid to love anything at all, except inanimate things that won't disappear (a tree, in the case of Paul D, a former slave). The book also talks about self-love, self-esteem and worth, which was denied them as well. Paul D oftens muses what it means to be a &quot;real man&quot;.<br />The theme is illustrated in the actions of Sethe, a slave who has run away with her four children. She has been able to keep each one since birth, nurture it and love it. She loves them with all the more intensity because she herself has never really known the love of another person or love of herself. So when the slave catchers eventually track her down, she makes a drastic decision. Sethe knows that her children face emotional death at the hands of the white man, and she decides physical death would be kinder. She kills one of her toddlers &quot;out of love&quot;.<br />This theme certainly got me thinking, as I believe it was true and valuable. But when I stepped back from the book, what bothered me about it was the way it was delivered. The undertone seemed to be dogmatic, intended to arouse shame rather than sympathy or understanding. Reading between the lines, I felt like an ignorant child that was being reproved and educated. The author assumed I was apathetic and ill-informed about what happened during the time of slavery in America, and therefore needed pointing in the right direction. So I found the presentation of the theme a little patronising.<br />Also, the writing was on occasion confusing. Sometimes you had no idea who or what was being referred to, as Ms Morrison tried too hard to sound literary and symbolic. The characters, I felt, were little more than manequins on which to drape the book's message (can't spell, I know). They aroused no emotion in me at all - you would think sympathy for Beloved, killed at the hands of her mother, or for Sethe, forced to make the decision she did. Nope. Not at all. So read this book for the thought-provoking theme, but be prepared to be left feeling a little flat.son tried too hard to sound literary and symbolic.

I should start by saying that I usually like bizarre fiction. Well, &quot;Wind-up Bird Chronicle&quot; is certainly that. A &quot;regular Joe&quot; for the main character, surrounded by the weird and inexplicable - psychic sisters named after islands, a healer and her mute son (named after spices), a well with no water in it, and an alternative reality set in a hotel.<br />The beginning of the book sucks you in, written in a crisp, modern style, with no high-brow literary waffle. Very quickly you realise that something strange is happening to our &quot;normal&quot; protagonist, Toru Okada. The events don't seem to be connected in any way, but they are portrayed as clues, and you are batting for Toru to figure them out. The random, bizarre happenings make you excited, curious, desperate to read on.<br />So then you read on. And on. More strange characters and events get introduced. There are large forays into the Japanese occupation of Manchuria before WWII and gruesome stories of violence there. But still, you think (or rather hope, by now) that this will all be explained. Somehow. But alas, it isn't. And you begin to suspect that many of the things you thought were significant &quot;clues&quot;, were actually just there to increase the &quot;weird and quirky&quot; factor. <br />At the end, several important people and occurances had just disappeared out of the novel (Malto and Creta Kano?), or were left hanging without explanation or resolve. I don't want the meaning of everything spelled out to me, I'm happy to use my imagination to figure some things out. But this book didn't even leave me with a skeleton on which to build my thoughts at the end. Only one of the themes (good vs. evil - how original) was resolved to my satisfaction.<br />Read Murakami's book for an introduction to his style, read it if the words &quot;Japanese&quot; and &quot;bizarre&quot; in combination sound good. But don't expect to finish it feeling contented.	2004-04-07

Among the topics covered are:<br />1. A comparison of fascism with the three main political movements that preceeded it: liberalism, conservatism and socialism. It is highlighted that fascism was more about aesthetics and emotion than intellectual philosophy or reason (particularly compared with communism).<br />2. How and why fascist movements sprang up in certain countries and not others. There is a great explanation of the disillusionment after WWI and the longing for a new sense of national pride in people, which highlighted a political \\"gap\\" for fascism to emerge in.<br />3. How incumbant liberal and conservative governments made political deals with fascist parties out of fear of a communist onslaught. This gave fascisin Germany and Italy political legitimacy.<br />4. Whether or not fascism still exists today, and if it could make a resurgence. An alternative view of the Israel/Palestine conflict is presented.<br />This book is written in a highly intellectual style, and yet all the arguments are easy to understand. Each paragraph and chapter flows in logical procession. Little prior knowledge of fascism (or politics in general) is assumed, and the explanations and background information are well presented.<br />I bought this book as a present for my husband, since I normally read literary fiction, romances etc. The fact that I picked it up and was hooked (finished it before he did), is a testament to it's comprehensible style and content. It will appeal just as much to the lay person who likes to think, as to the scholar in the field. Get it, read it. You won't regret it.	2004-04-07

Paxton has written a comprehensive introduction to, and discussion of fascism in all its forms. Some of the main topics the book deals with are:<br />1. Fascism compared with the other main political movements - liberalism, conservatism and socialism. Paxton points out that unlike these, Fascism is more about aesthetics and emotion rather than intellectual ideology and reason.<br />2. The factors which predisposed certain nations to fascism and not others. Particularly, the disillusionment and crises in politics following WW1, which created a gap in the political landscape for fascist movements to form. <br />3. How the fascist movements gained political legitimacy by making deals with incumbant conservatives and liberals who feared a communist takeover.<br />  \\"Anatomy of Fascism\\" is certainly not an easy read - it is written in a highly intellectual style. Nevertheless, the arguments it proposes are always clear and understandable. I bought this book as a present for my husband, and I finished it before he did. I have never read political history or non-fiction before, as I always thought the topic too dry and boring. The fact that this book managed to captivate me (I normally read literature, romances etc), is a testament to it's comprehensible style and fascinating content.<br />The Anatomy of Fascism will appeal to the uninitiated novice as well as the student in the field. It assumes little prior knowledge of fascism and explains things in context, giving background information where necessary. The arguments unfold in a sequential, orderly manner. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to \\"explore\\" political history, and see fascism in a new, more objective light.	2004-04-03

As others have said, this is the life story of an ordinary woman: Daisy Goodwill Flett. Her birth, childhood, marriages, children and Florida retirement. Nothing spectacular there, but it is exactly this quiet normality which is the most interesting part of the book. <br />Daisy's mother grew up in an orphanage, where all the children with untraceable parents were given the surname &quot;Stone&quot;. This is where the book's title comes from. Daisy, like her mother, is an orphan of sorts - but in an emotional sense. She feels somehow disconnected from the events in her life and the people she knows. As the book tells us,<br />&quot; 'Moving right along' is what she murmurs to herself these days - on her way to Hairworks for her weekly shampoo and set, on her way to the post office or her doctor's appointment or downstairs to the club room for her daily round of bridge. Moving right along, and along, and along. The way she's done all her life. Numbly. Without thinking.&quot;<br />Hence, Daisy reveal little about herself in this &quot;autobiography&quot;, except that she struggles to find any meaning to her life. She never expresses her thoughts on what happens to her, nor why she makes certain decisions. This role is left to her family and friends, who populate the book with bursts of feeling. Each of them spills forth how they feel about people, decisions they've made, their dreams, their actions. They all mention Daisy and her life, but assign their own meaning to it, distorted by how her actions affect them.<BR>The peripheral characters all seem to have vibrant lives - although nothing extraordinary happens to them either, they &quot;feel&quot; alive. The contrast underlines how the main character feels somehow lacking and &quot;left out&quot; of her own life.<BR>  <BR>Having said that, the book is not depressing at all. It was well written, I loved the peripheral characters, and if anything, it left me thinking. At the end I wondered - how many others go throughlife feeling it simply wash over them, thinking there should be more to it, but never finding out what? <br />This is a &quot;quiet&quot; autobiography, not prone to overwhelming action, but it is worthwhile nonetheless. The only gripe I had was that I found the photos didn't really match with the characters - it was obvious they had been randomly assembled from other sources to &quot;fit&quot; the descriptions ( according to the reading guide anyway). But still, give it your time and you will be rewarded.	2004-03-25

She was a lady-in-waiting/best friend to Queen Anne of England. She took this position of power for granted, treating the Queen much like a dumb child. She felt it was her right to instruct the Queen on appropriate political decisions and appointments at court. When Sarah became too pushy and arrogant, the Queen severed the friendship, leading to a very public fall from favour.<br />2. She was married to the military man John Churchill, who defeated Louis XIV's French army in the early 1700s (A big thing at the time - remember England and France were arch enemies). This victory led Queen Anne to give John and Sarah titles (Duke and Duchess of Marlborough) and a huge government grant to build a massive palace with - Blenheim, which still stands today outside of Oxford UK.<br />3. Her direct descendents include Winston Churchill and Diana, Princess of Wales.<br />  Ophelia Field has written a biography which covers all these events, and also tells us objectively about the woman herself. She does not attempt to paint a rosy picture of Sarah, who could be stubborn and domineering. At the same time, she explains WHY Sarah did certain things (based on letters she wrote to family and friends - many excerpts included), and why her political views were as they were. Crucially, she discusses how Sarah's support of the Whig party, her deep rooted belief in their righteousness, developed into a fanatacism which led to her fall from the Queen's favour and high society. Queen Anne is also brought to life as a woman all her own, though her reign was short.<br />  This biography was informative, educational (about the political and aristocratic climate of the time 1680s-1720s), and fascinating. It portrayed a modern woman ahead of her time. I feel if I had met Sarah Churchill, I may not have liked her (she polarised people - you either loved or hated her), but I certainly would have respected and admired her.and admired her.	2004-03-24

Make sure you get the full version though to get the most out of it.<br />And yes, I know that Hugo goes off on tangents, spends far too long on the battle of Waterloo etc. But really, the rest of the book - the interwoven plots, the characters, their motivations -make up for these ten times over. The musical and movies CANNOT do justice to this masterpiece. Please, if you've seen them, make the effort to read the book - it will be well worth it.<br />This book made me think about human nature and the definition of a &quot;good&quot; person for a long, long time afterwards. It is one of the few books where I have cried at the end - not just because of the ending, but because I was so moved.<br /> Anyone who gives this book less than 4 stars is a philistine.

I found this dysfunctional family, who didn't seem to want to be a family (but were forced to anyway), really fascinating.<br /> Reading this book, it isn't until the end that you realise what Ruby finally realises: that the individuals in families don't have to get along, they don't have to like eachother, they don't even have to take the same paths in life. But they will always have shared experiences (even if they had no choice in the matter), and somehow this is an indelible bond. <br />The anecdotes in the book are relayed with genuine feeling - as another reader has said, &quot;tragi-comical&quot; in their subject matter. The characters are brilliantly portrayed - amusing, quirky, selfish people who somehow still manage to have a bond with eachother (though they scarcely realise it). And the reflection on the meaning of family is subtle, not sickening and obvious. <br />Put simply, this is a moving, and yet highly entertaining book. I would recommend it to anyone that wants more from fiction than a fast-paced, light read.	2004-03-23

Considering that this book features the excesses of court life under Charles II and the treatment of the mentally ill in the 17th Century, I really expected to enjoy it. As a simple story I did, but I constantly felt that something was lacking.<br />  The book tries to show us the evolution of Robert Merrivel's character from hedonistic, self-interested and needy, to wise and contented. Indeed, at the end of the book Merrivel seems to achieve what he craved all the way through - a sense of worth and of being loved by someone. He thought he had these at the beginning of the book in the form of social standing and the King's affection, but discovered that he was fooling himself.<br />It was surprising then, that in the end, he finds these things in just that - social standing and the King's affection. The fact that we are told Merrivel eventually realises his foolishness in wanting the King's friendship, and yet at the end still craves, pursues and recieves it anyway, I felt somehow ridiculous. I wondered whether this really showed a transformation of character. He made use of the same things as he did in the beginning of the book for affirmation. In short, I found it disappointing that his aims and goals, and his criteria for happiness, did not change along with his personality.  Merrivel's actions simply do not reflect what the book is trying to tell us has occured within him. This incongruity bothered me quite a lot, and left me wondering what the point of describing the inner transformation was.<br />I also felt more could have been made of the Bedlem section of the book. It would have been nice if Merrivel had made a discovery on the treatment of mental illness, just as he realised that the heart as an organ has no sense of feeling (a well known medical fact today). But that is just a personal feeling I guess.<br />Read this book if you want a good story, and an interesting main character. Just don't expect the emotional journey of Merrivel to make much sense in the end.	2004-03-22

As others have said, this book tries to explore the concepts of women (slaves and wives) as property. In itself, the idea is brilliant. It is unfortunate then, that the author merely skimmed the surface, producing a novel that seems uncertain as to what it's purpose is. In terms of plot, the story was quite simple - Manon is unhappily married, she is widowed and maimed during a slave rebellion on her plantation, and spends the rest of the book trying to recapture the runaway slave Sarah. <BR>  <BR>  This simple plot arc would not have bothered me one bit, if the emotional side of the story had been meatier. Although the author mentioned time and again how Manon felt towards the slaves and her own predicament, it failed to rouse any emotion in me at all. It seemed to be just words on the page. Surely with a topic such as this, the potential was to arouse hate, shock, sympathy, sadness on the theme. The author has done none of these, and as such has wasted a good idea. As such, all I was left with was the feeling that this was an intellectual argument, an illustration of attitudes at the time, rather than an emotional journey. <br />  With the lack of feeling in the book, all that was left to redeem it was the plot, and as I have said, it was not very complex. If the book had been longer, with more events, it may have been alright despite the lack of feeling. At the end, I was still wondering about Manon's father's &quot;failing&quot;, about what happens to Manon in the long term, what happens to Sarah and Walter. I had to assume their lives just carried on as before, and nothing that had happened changed them. This in itself could have been more powerfully reinforced to stimulate feeling - that Manon is not one bit altered by her experiences. But alas, the book just seemed to end. Full stop. <br />  In short, I finished &quot;Property&quot; thinking that the book had not lived up to it's potential. The one thought I had at the end was &quot;So what?&quot; I already suspected that slave owners felt the way this book describes. It didn't tell me anything new, didn't challenge me to re-examine my feelings and views on this, which it so easily could have done.	2004-03-20
