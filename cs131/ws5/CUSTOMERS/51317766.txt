I highly recommend finding another book.    This book is first, aimed at AWD models, is too broad to cover specifics, and as it is, the pictures are so dark that it's hard to see small pieces. I've done about three minor jobs (replacing the factory rear speakers as they were blown- it didn't even tell you how to take the rear deck apart, drum brakes, and trying to locate the sensor in the gas tank), and all three, the book was worthless, even as a reference point. Aside from basic info, don't count on this book for much, unless you have the exact vehicle they used to illustrate the book.	2005-06-12

Naturally, owning a sporty-looking car, I want to back that up with actual power. <br /> <br />This book was fairly well written, offering several tips that will save you from detonation (which unless you like swapping motors, you'll really want to avoid that). My only complaint really is that the book is a bit thin (128 pages). It does contain a lot of information, and is well worth the price; but all in all, I wish there had been a little more weight to the book. <br /> <br />Nitrous does offer several benefits, and this book explains expected yield, supporting modifications (if you ever thought you could do a hard shot of nitrous on your stock, passenger car; you need to buy this book right this instant) and the hows and whys of nitrous. I thought this was an excellent book and I'm seriously considering adding a nitrous system to my vehicle after reading it. <br /> <br />I would suggest a turbo-charger if you're looking for \\"all the time\\" power, but if you're looking for a little extra \\"boost\\" off the line, n20 is your bag. This book tells you how to make it work for you.	2005-04-11

Okay, I'll admit it, I bought this book mostly 'cause I wanted to maybe brush up here and there just to make sure I got a decent score on the test. <br />I really thought I was the man where WinXP was concerned. I do registry tweaking how-tos for a PC site, I've done troubleshooting and repair for MS products since the 80s. I've gone well past the realms of the new user...<br />I picked up this book, and after getting through the standard stuff about what to expect from the test, the book then got deep into the kind of things you can expect as a network administrator. Stuff I haven't really had to deal with since the company I worked for went under (back in the days when Win NT servers and 98 terminals were all the rage). <br />Trust me, if you haven't had to spend a lot of time SERIOUSLY networking WindowsXP, get this book. It probably saved me over 100 bucks for the retest as it is.<br />Oh, and by \\"Seriously Networking\\" Windows XP, I don't mean a home network with a DSL setup, or maybe a small office with a 5-port Router. I mean stuff like what authentication should be used on a VPN running L2TP/IPSEC.<br />It'll be a few before I head down to take the test. I've had pretty good luck with Exam Cram's books for my last couple certifications. I also recently added another Exam Cram book for my Server+ studies, and it's already covered a lot of ground my more expensive MS-press guide did not.<br />As for the benefits of this test, an O/S certification is almost a requirement these days. My Comptia certifications alone wouldn't have gotten me hired at my last job, if it hadn't been for my previous experience, I'd have been up the proverbial creek. Also, Microsoft lets you \\"in\\" as a MCP (Microsoft Certified Professional), and you get access to more Windows Info. In this day and age, the more knowledge you have, the better off you are.	2003-06-17

I read through the second edition like a kid in a candy store. It had the information I wanted (and needed) to keep up with networking.<br />The Third edition seems to take it from there and run with it. Wireless and \\"Blue Tooth\\" are described in detail (Which was REALLY helpful), It covers new aspects of network security, upgrading networks, backbone cabling and all sorts of nifty stuff!<br />The software on the included disk isn't bad (A lot of the software is trail version, however). The technical information is rather useful as it contains BIOS error codes, a hard-drive database, and some other nifty stuff. The movies (on motherboards) were rather informative, though (even for a hardware junkie like me). The guy doing the video is a little dry, but bear with him, he has a lot of useful things to say!	2002-03-12

You can't know what happened before it came back, even with a warranty, you could have problems you shrug off now that turn into bigger problems later).<br />All in all, an excellent book, a good balance of the the light and dark sides of the internet. I'd say if you want to keep what you think is important safe, or just learn a bit about offense on the internet, pick up this book.	2001-12-18

I have not taken the test yet (I do plan on it), but it has been heavily useful as far as better understanding the server(s) I work with every day. It also refreshed my mind on the A+/ network+ objectives that are included in the Server+ exam as outlined by Comptia.<br />The book's CD also contains a full copy of the book, so if you and your laptop want to leave this heavy little tome behind, just download and go! Also, the A-Z network encyclopedia E-book was pretty impressive (it includes several diagrams and a heckuva lot of information).<br />The only reason I give this book four stars is the simple fact I wish they would have included an interactive, sample test on the CD. Sample tests are usually pretty helpful, and doing them on the computer sets the feel for the actual exam. Otherwise, an excellent book!	2001-07-29

This book has a ton of pertinent information on the I-net+ exam. The format, however, kind of needed help. In the back of the book is a chart for which chapter covers certain information on sections of the exam. I hate jumping back and forth, so I ended up just reading the whole darn thing and going back and reviewing. <br />Also, it needed more information on JDBC, Audio-files, troubleshooting and plug-ins. Also, a little more on graphic formats (which it covers, but doesn't go into the difference between GIF87 and GIF89, etc...) would have been nice. This book does have an excellent CD in the back of the book that has a pretty good pre-test.<br />After having taken the exam, I realized that this book had a few small holes. one was that not enough information on application of certain functions, such as what type of audio file would be the best under certain conditions, and other things that would have been helpful. Still, it covers a massive amount of information. <br />I would recommend this book, but you might want to combine it with something else to round out your education.	2001-07-01

This book is a little tricky to learn to use (especially for those of us still trying to get familiar with everything). I would suggest picking up a beginners guide before even looking in this book's general direction. <br />So why do I still give it five stars? Because when it finally does start making sense, it is a priceless resource!  This is the book to have when you get familiar enough with HTML to need a &quot;Just show me how to fix this thing, already!&quot; reference.<br />This tome has been a valuable resource to my collection, and I know it will be the same to yours!	2001-06-02

The pretest in the back of the book and the testing at each chapter made me go back and check out the information I needed to brush up on so I can pass the first time I take the exam (and at 190 dollars a pop for the exam... getting it right the first time is important)!<br />If you don't have the time to sit and read everything there ever was on the internet, pick up this book!	2001-05-15

Things such as expected behaviour, dying with honor, obeying one's lord, etc...<br />For today's reader, this book offers several tips on the proper mindset when in combat from a samurai's point of view. Still, Some of these rules are, to say the least, a little strange. <br />For a serious martial arts student, this book will probably find a place on your bookshelf (if it hasn't already). However, if you saw the movie &quot;Ghost Dog&quot; and were expecting a book of straight warrior-wisdom, you may wish to consider the fact this book has a lot of Japanese history in it. Some of Hagakure's content is a little dry, and although it offers profound insight in some places, it can be a bit hard to sort out what is useful in today's world.<br />Hagakure is also not put together in an user-friendly format. You have to search for specific quotes, because there doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason to it's layout. This can be tough when you want to go back and review how something was phrased to better understand it.<br />Still, this book is well worth the time and money. I have read it several times, and I'll probably read it several more...	2001-04-07

I tend to study sword-styles, and Aikido offers several movements based on sword-fighting principals (as well as actual sword-fighting based on old samurai movements). <br />It also has a bit on the history of Aikido, breathing, meditation, the life of Ueshiba Morihei (the founder of Aikido) and a glossary of Japanese terms. The rest of the book is mostly dedicated to movements. All in all, this is a must-have for anyone even remotely interested in Aikido.	2001-04-07

This book covers a bit on Novell, Unix, and Linux as well! <br />It also has an interesting section on security, an entire section dedicated to firewalls and extemely useful information on internet trouble-shooting!

I've liked it enough to buy it again when my first copy was destroyed.<br />Oh, and by the way... if your going to ever watch John Carpenter's movie version of &quot;Christine&quot;... do it first.

It seems like all the coolest characters get bit parts...<br />The story was very cool, I will give it that... I just wish it would have been a little less fragmented.	2001-02-05

As I am just picking up the Japanese language, I picked up what I figured would be a good beginner's guide, which is exactly what this is! I can say there is no way in heck that your going to learn everything this book has to offer in seven days (unless you're obsessive), but it offers a ton of beginning phrases, how to read basic road-signs (along with which bathroom your supposed to be in, which is helpful). It offers a lot of basic &quot;hi, how are you? Excuse me.

This book provides what so many books touch on, but never really go in-depth into. It provides a detailed viewpoint of the medical side of the martial arts from an Eastern viewpoint. <br />It talks about where Chi is generated, the medical benefits of stimulating Chi, uses, practice and so much more!

I actually downloaded the entire disk to my hard-drive so I would have it when I needed it!<br />I had been playing with my own web-site on and off for years now and I got fed up with having a boring site, so I picked up this book. I was not disappointed! I have learned how to wean myself off of an easy web-editor, to pure HTML. I've also learned how to make an image as a link, how to META tag and a whole bunch of other cool stuff I've been wanting to know how to do.<br />The only real complaint I have is that he tells you how to get a radio-button survey on your page, and then you have to link it to his site to get the results. I would have thought it cool if he had included the section on how to do it all yourself (although he mentioned the fact it would have made the book a bit thicker).<br />If your looking for the basics and maybe a little more, this will get you started!

Then I got this one.<br />Part of my main complaint on this book was the fact that every time I got into a character, he/she would die. They didn't leave me a helluva lot to vote for. I tend to get into books that give you a character that has a well-defined personality, and is in it for more than thirty pages... As many of the other reviews will tell you, Lord Soth wasn't in this one all that much, although the entire story revolves around him in one way or another.<br />The characters that are in this book all seemed urged on by self interest. The only really cool character is the Bloody Cobbler, and he isn't the entire book (I would gladly pick up another Ravenloft book if he's in it, I really wish they would have had more of him in this one).<br />The end was cool, but the beginning and a lot of the middle were basically describing a character, building them into a person, and then killin' them off. Again, the end was cool, but the rest was kind of off the subject. <br />I still have to say, though ... that is probably one of the coolest book covers I've seen!	2000-12-30

This book is a complete tome of computer-related information, and by tome, I mean 1,600+ pages. Aside from that, it also comes with partition magic and a few other goodies on a CD-rom on the book's back cover.<br />It has complete details on just about everything inside the case of your machine, from the CPU to the little LED lights in the front. I actually got this book as part of a class I was taking, and I learned a great deal from it! The information is getting slightly dated, as he talks about the &quot;new&quot; 32 meg video cards... but with the information presented, it doesn't really matter. It's a great guide to parts, pieces, chips and so very much more! You'll probably find a use for this book even years from now, when most of the parts listed become obsolete. A computer repair person knows there a LOT of OLD systems still out there. If you're the one who's tryin' to understand it, this book is going to be a heavenly thing. Regardless, the information is also a lot of how they build the chips, boards, processors etc... and that won't become obsolete anytime soon!<br />I am going to get the 12th edition of this book series pretty soon...

Strahd of course, is devious enough to keep out of the direct path of the Death Knight's fury... but a lot of others aren't so lucky.<br />Soth is dark, cold and fairly cool as he destroys anyone who stands in his way in his search to find a way out. The ending was not a surprise, but it was cool enough to not take away from the book.

It's all about conditions, who has the advantage and how to dishearten your  opponents while making sure your own resources are protected. It tells you  what to look for through hundreds of various quotes and snippets of advice.  This book was not entirely by Sun Tzu, but a collection of famous  tacticians through-out history. Each seem to add another element to the  concept of how to win in conflict. In life, you can see a little of this in  each day... but just remember not too get too carried away...<br />after all,  even Sun Tzu himself said &quot;A battle not fought, is a battle  won.&quot;<br />I would recommend this one... it can only broaden your  prospective. I'd suggest adding this book to your collection as well as  &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot; by Miyamoto Musashi and the &quot;Tao Te  Ching&quot; by Lao Tzu.

This book covers a great deal of old-fashioned sword-play (inlcuding swords versus polearms, etc). The way it &quot;shadows&quot; in every diagram showing whatever is undefended, is also a great way to show what is  vulnerable. <br />It also covers guard positions, the use of a shield,  two-handed swords, some interesting quotes from old warriors and an  excellent reference on what to look for when buying a sword in this modern  age (where the author feels we should catch up to the old forgers in maybe  the next generation or so... because our swords are still not as good as  the old ones).<br />I have to admit that the author does compare to the silver  screen/ theatrical a great deal, but I think it is more in the spirit of  &quot;if your trying to learn how to sword-fight from movies like  &quot;Excaliber&quot;... this is why it isn't going to work. Also, just  because you've studied fencing with your theatre group... don't think  you're going to be able to take on a kenjutsu student.<br />I've studied into  several styles and forms of sword-fighting... this book still offers  something new.<br />I just wish there would have been a section on  double-sword styles (which was mentioned... but never really illistrated)  and more on short swords.	2000-07-04

I'd  say read it, just realize that it takes the entire book to get to the  object they're after!	1999-07-30

What happened was a lot of &quot;brainless&quot; violence, a strange story and an ending that is too screwed up for  words.<br />I'd say pass...	1999-07-25

Everything from talking to one's employer sarcastically (without getting fired), how to live through endless meetings and how to rule the world (quit and become an consultant)! That is just some of the useful skills!  Along with Alice controlling the &quot;Fist of Death&quot;, Wally's work  evasion tactics, and Dogbert's scheming plots you'll wonder how you ever  got along without it!	1999-04-22

This book provides a tasteful look into death investigation. It also provides statistics on just about every part of it (ie. A chart of the speeds one obtains while falling, a look at electricity and what to look  for at every step of the way). I highly recommend this book to anyone  seriously interested in this subject. It's 800+ pages will answer just  about anything you want to know.	1999-04-22

The weapons and technology of Triax is awesome! It also includes some cool OCC's, a good look into the gargoyle empire's technology (Which is really cool looking)  and a couple of comic-book style stories to explain everything!	1999-04-22

It combined old mysticism with amazing technology. The only thing it was missing was that the cool motorcycles and other vehicles that were pictured, but were not given stats on! It also made  Japan seem less powerful than the &quot;NGR&quot; (technology wise). The  old mystics (like the traditional ninja and samurai) are a little weak, as  they had low mega-damage stats and refuse to use technology so you can't  even fit them into a suit of power armor to protect them! A lot of it was  rehash too, like the Japanese &quot;Samas&quot; operator and the Japanese  &quot;Glitterboy&quot;. Other than that, the weapons were pretty cool, the  possible adventures are good, the OCCs are excellent, and if you combine  this book with &quot;Ninjas and superspies&quot; it really brings it to  life!	1999-04-16
