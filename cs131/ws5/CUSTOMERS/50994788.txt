I'll try to write this review without spoilers (difficult!).  This novel is closer to Chamber of Secrets or Prisoner of Azkaban than it is to Order of the Phoenix or Goblet of Fire, and I liked that.  It focuses more on the trio without introducing numerous new characters.  You find out some interesting backstory (though not about James and Lily, which is what I was hoping for), get a little romance (though not fleshed out enough in my opinion) and the typical Harry Potter mystery/quest portion.  The book could have been edited a bit better (remove the first few chapters about the impact on the muggle world and flesh out some of the relationships more) but that's a minor quibble.  A very enjoyable read, but I don't know how she's going to wrap the series up in under 1200 pages--lots of questions remain unanswered!	2005-07-17

I found no new information about Mrs. Madison, and the information that was rehashed was terribly organized for a disruptive reading experience.  Over and over again the author jumps from topic to topic, interupting what seems like it could be an interesting arguement or point with some unrelated piece of information that destroys the rhythm of the thought.  The information on the complex relationships within the Payne and Madison families is written out rather than expressed in a family tree and is nearly useless.  Photographs are sprinkled throughout the book [...] but the captions are all at the end of the book.  I found it very disruptive to have to turn to the back to find out what I was looking at and what the significance of the photo might be.   Very, very disappointing.	2005-04-26

Hollywood history, women's history, art history all rolled into one readable and thought provoking volume.  This one is right up there with Louise Brooks by Barry Paris as one of the best books on film and those who created it.	2005-04-05

The author takes the reader through the confusing process of creating an exterior color palette that resonates with the ideals of the Arts and Crafts movement.  The photographs and layout were superb and the writing clear and consise.   <br /> <br />Some reviewers have noted differences between the SW paint chips and the photos in the book.  There are some variations, but printed color reproduction is notoriously difficult and this is a $30 paperback, not a $100 fine art book with perfect calibration.  For the price range this book is in I found the color in the book to be fine.  The author suggests painting your proposed colors on a sample board or the old siding and living with them so one would see any color differences during this process, in plenty of time to correct them before painting your home.   <br /> <br />The binding on my copy was tight and of good quality.   <br /> <br />I would highly recommend this book.	2005-03-08

What is being photographed ranges from the mundane to the odd, and the ideas rarely said \\"Christmas!\\" to me.  For instance, for the white decorating scheme the author suggests tying string around a white rock and putting it on the napkin in your placesetting.  The author gives few details on how to achieve the looks she writes about.  I was very disappointed.	2004-10-14

It is a quick read, mainly stories of the experiences of the author and her friends who were lured to live \\"the simple life\\" \\"off the grid\\" in the country.  Many references are made to how easy Mother Earth magazine made it seem to drop out;  a simile might be drawn that says Mother Earth magazine is to back to the landers as Lansford Hastings' The Emigrants' Guide to Oregon and California was to the Donner Party-both documents were oversimplified and omitted many important details to the sorrow of those that used them as a guide.  The book is frequently laugh out loud funny when describing the attempts of city folk to adapt to country life.  I especially liked the chapters that outlined how the \\"back to the landers\\" dealt with their unexpected poverty.  I only wish that experience had given more of them impetus to fight poverty for all rather than just escape it themselves.  I wanted the author would have included stories from a broader range of people, and to give communes a separate section in the book rather than combining those experiences with the stories of families who lived independently in the country.  Another topic that isn't adequately dealt with is feminism (or lack thereof) amongst the people who chose this lifestyle.  The author makes several references to having to do all the traditionally feminine tasks without help from her husband and being bitter about that.  Why didn't she ask for help?  Was it easier to fall into sex role stereotypes in this situation?  I wanted to know more about this topic.  The book also wraps up too quickly and doesn't explore why people left the land and how they assimilated back into society in the depth that I wished for.  Still, a worthwhile read.	2004-10-06

Lambert uses first person interviews and historical research to craft a beautifully written portrait of the last gasp of the debutante system in Britain before WWII.  The details make you feel like you were there and the biographies of the \\"girls\\" who took part are fascinating.  A bit on the Kennedy girls too, who were in England with their father Ambassador Joe Kennedy, if you are interested.  Photos are great, I just wish there were more of them since the author frequently talks about the scrapbooks she was given to look at during her research.	2004-08-13

I agree with the other reviewers that a big reason for that accolade is the fact that Mr. Paris writes about Louise Brooks as a person and not as a &quot;movie star&quot;. In fact, my favorite portion of the book is the section on her life after Hollywood and prior to her writing career. Paris writes an incisive psychological portrait of a complex woman. And the last lines of the book, taken from one of Louise's letters, still haunt me--the perfect ending. Buy it, read it and treasure it.	2004-08-02

I was also disappointed that most of the photos that were included have been seen multiple times in other sources.  Since the extended Romanov family is not as well known as the Windsors I also wish the photographs would have been organized by generation rather than by category (military service, deaths, etc.).  The photo quality throughout the book is good.  My summary; the book is worth getting but don't expect alot on Nicholas, Alexandra and their children.	2004-05-14

The hip, sacastic tone of the writing undermines the credibilty of the book; the authors would have been better off spending more time exploring their topic and less time dreaming up one-liners.  The book explores two main topics; the excessive demands placed on todays mothers and the resulting deification of today's children and pushing for nationalized healthcare.  I was disappointed in the tendancy of the book to glorify the feminist movement of the early 1970s; if the movement was so effective why were most of its legislative moves defeated?  If universal day care funded by the government is the answer (as the authors seem to believe) then how can the feminist movement of today help make that a reality?  Worth checking out from the library but prepare to be frustrated.	2004-03-18

I found the photographs mundane and the essays almost unbearable as Simon chronicles his constant drug taking and drifting from place to place.  As another reviewer wrote, I don't think we would have seen this book printed if not for his name and his celebrity sister.	2002-03-06

I love the fact that she gives you graphed patterns for historic clothing and her writing is clear and interesting.  The projects are not for the beginning seamstress, but are clearly explained by the author.  I guess I have a problem with some of the clothes she chooses to reproduce--not all the examples are good looking or typical of their period.  The choices seem very esoteric; for some people that is probably part of their charm.  If you find enough examples you like I would recommend the books, but you might want to take a look at them at the library first.	2001-05-16

However, that's where the hybrid part comes in--watercolors of men's jewelry is bookended by lovely, mostly unseen photos of Nicholas' family.  I would rather have had one book on the jewelry of the whole Imperial family and another separate book on Princess Irene's extrodinary photos.

Hardly.  The commentary on the images presented in this book are painfully brief and pedestrian at best; they add no new insight.  Many of the images have been seen in many other books; those that are new aren't that interesting.  <br />However, most disturbing is the text.  Tasha Tudor is a woman known for cherishing her privacy.  This book spends most of its time trying to destroy it, elaborating on information more suited to a scandal sheet than to a serious book examining Tasha Tudor's art.  Vingettes about the author's involvement with Tudor are mean spirited in the extreme.  <br />I'm sure Ms. Tudor, like all of us, has her moments, but in my opinion it is clear that this book was written by her former business partner as a form of revenge.

Still, the writing style is engaging and the photos  are well chosen.  Take it's theories with a grain of salt and it is a fun  read.	2000-03-29

A nice mix of day and evening wear at the turn of the 19th century and good likenesses.  It was also great to see a paper doll (Dolley Madison) who wasn't reed thin!  A minor  criticism would be that the color occaisionally seems clumsily applied, but  overall a great book.	2000-03-29
