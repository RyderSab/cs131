I just finished reading this book a few minutes ago, and I don't know what else to exclaim except \\"I totally loved it!\\"  <br /> <br />Confession time... despite the scores of books I have read, I am one of those who will browse in a bookstore, see a flashy book cover or a catchy title and, like a fish to bait, grab it, and peek at what's inside (yeah, many of you probably do it too, but think you're too hep & packed full of intelligentsia to admit it, even to yourselves!). The title \\"One-Hit Wonder\\" and its day-glo cover lured me in, but what convinced me to buy it was to opening chapter, which consists of a former pop-star's letter to her estranged kid sister. Without knowing anything else about the plot, I was moved by the letter itself. <br /> <br />Out of the letter and into the story: young, tall, nerdy and awkward Ana Wills travels from her sleepy hometown of Devon to London, where her big sister was recently found dead. The original purpose of this trip is to clear out her sister's apartment and tie up loose ends. But after searching through her sister's belongings ---and making the seemingly simple discovery that her sister had a cat named John (who is MIA)--- Ana decides to search out people who were friends with the sister she barely knew. What is intended to be a one day clean-up trip into the big city turns into a belated coming of age novel.   <br /> <br />And if one had to boil this story down to one category, that's how I would nail it: \\"belated coming-of-age.\\" The cool thing is, we don't have to nail it down to one genre. This book can be categorized as a mystery, saga, pop-culture, slice of life, romance... Lisa Jewell encompasses quite a lot of stories in just one story. <br /> <br />What intrigued me throughout the story was the unpredictable nature of the characters as a whole. It's not that each character did things mind-blowingly against his or her nature. The unpredictability shows in the wide variety of characters strolling in-&-out of this novel; some are as simple and predictable as a Charles Dickens character or a Speed Racer villain; other folks have much more substance than meets the eye. Lisa Jewell will keep you guessing, which I found to be half the fun of the book. <br /> <br />\\"One-Hit Wonder\\" is both a fun and emotional read. And if you are one of those guys who can't get into \\"chick-flicks\\" and see this as a literary chick-flick, well... just like the occasional \\"Steel Magnolias,\\" I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by this totally awesome tale!   <br /> <br />	2005-04-13

He keenly dismisses practicing any religion out of necessity, obligation, or hope of reward, and instead drives home the notion of religion and meditation as sources of expression and enjoyment.  <br /> <br />Still, if you are going to pick only one of Alan Watts' lecture series, then \\"Buddhism: The Religion of No Religion\\" is vastly superior to this work. If you enjoy any of his lecture series, I strongly urge you to seek out his lengthier written projects like \\"The Way of Zen.\\" Watts had quite a way of making Zen Buddhism tangible to the Western reader.	2005-02-10

Why do I love \\"The Onion\\" compilations? Because I can begin browsing through an edition in a bookstore with the intent of obtaining a chuckle or two, only to find that I am doubled over laughing at articles so insensitive and oh-so very wrong! The Onion produces, in individuals, priceless moments when we laugh hysterically while begging ourselves \\"Stop laughing, this is vile, and NOT FUNNY!\\" <br /> <br />For those of you who have yet to encounter The Onion, it is a satirical newspaper that attacks virtually everyone ---people both real and imaginary--- and mocks their most cherished political, religious, and domestic beliefs. Everybody and their brothers are humorously assaulted here: neither the liberal nor conservatives, rich nor poor, powerful nor pitiful are spared. The Onion is the rare case of an orchestrated Guajardian paper-raid. If The Onion were a newspaper delivered by the old-school bike-peddling paper boy, he might as well be chucking grenades upon the neighborhood doorsteps! <br /> <br />This particular edition is my personal favorite dishing of The Onion's inappropriate humor, with the crowning glory appearing on page 49 under the headline \\"Developmentally Disabled Senator Wants To Be Treated Like Any Other Lawmaker.\\" You will probably not go to Heaven after reading that story. Articles that come close to this humor ratio include \\"Man Dies After Long And Painful Battle With Life\\" on page 21, and \\"Children, Creepy Middle-Aged Weirdos Swept Up In Harry Potter Craze\\" on page 25. <br /> <br />There are plenty of other great targets in this edition, from Smurf collectors to Bar-Trivia Champs to celebrity stalkers to celebrities. <br /> <br />Every compilation The Onion has issued is excellent, but \\"Ad Nauseam\\" is their finest publication! <br />	2005-02-09

Chapman does an amazing job at piecing together the life story of Eugen Sandow, who was part workaholic, part legit, and part hype. What makes Chapman's coverage of Sandow so impressive his near disclaimer in the preface: that despite there being plenty of print on Sandow from his heyday, how much of it is reliable is questionable. Chapman sounds almost dismissive of his end result, but by piecing together multiple sources of Sandow's history, he has done an excellent job portraying which aspects of Sandow's works were impressive, which aspects were marketing hype. Sandow is neither deified nor demonized; this is a biography written the way biographies should be written. <br /> <br />Eugen Sandow had both incredible talent as well as sly business savvy. With a chiseled physical in a day when massive muscles were few and far between, he is the first man to successfully market such a wild physical fitness mania, an industry that seems to be at an all time high in the 21st Century. This book serves as a tour of Sandow's evolution from theatrical strongman to a pioneer in mail order fitness courses and health clubs (Sandow's Institute of Physical Culture).   <br /> <br />While it is easy to fill this book with Sandow's many legitimate achievements, Chapman never shies away from showing his embarrassing flops, like Sandow's continuous reinvention of his biography, his joke-of-a-fight with a circus lion, and the \\"Sandow's Health & Strength Cocoa\\" debacle. We also see the rare instances where Sandow realizes a challenge from a rival strongman or wrestler is out of his league, and his wise and sometimes clever ways he bowed out of the competition. It should be noted, however, that Chapman shows us more instances of Sandow being the man making the challenge, resulting in showboaters and \\"Sandow impostors\\" trying to duck the challenge.  <br /> <br />This book also reveals the balance of Sandow's personal and professional life, from his rocky but lasting marriage to Blanche Brookes Sandow, the multitude of women (including some female celebrities of the day) who hit on him, to his professional and personal friendship with Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of bodybuilding or pop-culture, this book is an essential addition to your library. This is one of the most underrated biographies I have read in quite some time. David Chapman's notes and bibliography are impressive alone (and there are SO MANY books on pop-culture history that penny-pinch in this department). This book will reel you in at the beginning, and hold your attention until the last page.  <br /> <br />	2005-01-29

Nancy's \\"Letters From a Nut\\" series, picture The Jerky Boys or Crank-Yankers in written form. Nancy's way-out letters to celebrities, corporations and government offices are a laugh riot.<br /><br />This particular book is my personal favorite of the series, and topping this collection are the priceless rehabilitation suggestions he recommends to several correctional institutions. He also writes a hysterical letter to The New Orleans Saints Chief of Security citing concerns that his resemblance to our 21st president Chester A. Arthur might require tighter security when he attends a game in New Orleans.<br /><br />I consider myself a tough sell when it comes to written humor, but three sources that double-me-over are Jon Stewart, The Onion, and Ted Nancy's \\"Letters From a Nut\\" books. It has been awhile since we've seen a new addition to this series, and I certainly hope that Mr. Nancy has not put his pen to rest. He has a mischevious gift!	2005-01-08

There is some well researched information about the dawning of The MC5, and well detailed material on The MC5's association with John Sinclair and The White Panther movement. <br /> <br />The roadblock in this work hits hard though. It is an extremely condensed history (under 100 pages, and many of those are filled completely with photos), and would have worked better as a magazine article. Sinclair and The MC5's troubles with The FBI and Michigan Police make for a compelling story, but there is so much more to this one-of-a-kind rock phenomenon than their White Panther Party affiliation.  <br /> <br />Most unforgivable is the final chapter, which is devoted almost exclusively to the demise of The White Panther Party. The MC5's troubles and eventual break up are mentioned almost as an afterthought. There is no word on any of the members activities after the group disbanded; Fred \\"Sonic\\" Smith, Rob Tyner, Dennis Thompson, Michael Davis and Wayne Kramer went forward with their lives, most remaining involved with the music industry in some form. There are some good stories buried here, and one has got to wonder why the surviving Motor City 5 members were not contacted by the authors. I can only think they are accessible; I heard Wayne Kramer interviewed by National Public Radio's Terry Gross several years back, and that piece alone revealed more than in the pages of this book.  <br /> <br />Yes, the MC5 was a group that lasted only a few years, but it would take a few hundred pages to tell their fascinating story. I truly hope somebody takes up the challenge. The authors of \\"The Future is Now\\" have the potential to create such a work, but they do not deliver in this instance.	2005-01-03

Mr. Race tells the story of his career with both candor and respect to the people he works with in the wrestling biz. <br /> <br />Harley Race tells of his humble beginnings in the business; serving as chauffer for 800+ pound wrestler Happy Humphrey, learning how to market himself properly, from being a tag team mid-card wrestler to an individual main eventer. You'll read how he worked his way through several major injuries and tragic losses from his rookie years and past his career as an active wrestler.  <br /> <br />For those of you who have never seen Harley Race wrestle, he is one of the most unique and talented of the classic NWA Heavyweight Champions. He looked like one of those old-movie whisky-voiced sailors you might see belting it out with Popeye, but in the ring he moved with the grace of a dancer. He could take just about anybody out in a fight, but was a true professional, always making his opponent look good in a match, always giving the wrestling fans a good show. <br /> <br />There are lots of great \\"On the Road\\" tales here, from his friendships with Humphrey, Ted DiBiase, Dynamite Kid & Davey Boy Smith, his having to put folks like \\"Lawman\\" Don Slatton and Robot C3 in line, his plane flight sitting next to Boy George, to the friendships he acquired with fans throughout the years. Harley Race is one class act.  <br /> <br />I don't know if I would recommend this book for somebody who is new to wrestling fandom; great as the book is, I think it might occasionally lose the reader who does not already have a decent understanding of old school pro wrestling.  <br /> <br />If there is any other criticism of this book, it is only that it is too brief. I would have loved another hundred or so pages of Harley Race memories. That said, Mr. Race does an excellent job of compacting his story into just under 200 pages; he included the most pertinent, compelling, and moving stories into the mix. This is a must buy for fans of old school pro wrestling.	2004-12-15

I have plenty of books that try too hard to attack the novice readers with multiple Zen riddles and the \\"complexities that are not complex.\\" By the time the curious readers get to the third chapter of such books, a fascinating subject dwindles away. <br /> <br />Not so with this book. The credit goes to both Alan Watts ---for his smooth and concise lectures--- and the person/people who edited the transcripts. The result is 98 pages of a keen and precise overview of Zen Buddhism, where concepts of \\"The Religion of No-Religion\\" and \\"The Middle Way\\" are easily accessible to readers who are going into the subject matter knowing nothing.  <br /> <br />I especially liked the way Watts explains how the concept \\"The Cause of Suffering is Desire\\" is often misunderstood, emphasizing that when translated into English, \\"desire\\" might better be represented with words like \\"craving, clinging, or grasping.\\" He then does an excellent narrative into the paradox of students trying to eliminate \\"desire\\" from their existence, only to learn they are still desiring something: not to desire. Watts walks the reader through these way-out riddles in a way few people can. <br /> <br />I would go as far to recommend this work above Alan Watts' better known \\"The Way of Zen\\" if this is your first venture into Buddhism. After reading this book, \\"The Way of Zen\\" is a great follow-up, and the other complex introductions to Zen Buddhism will begin to make more sense. Nothing esoteric here, just straight talk on Buddhism. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-31
US	52993541	R1LXVYG9DCXCQU	1582618178	841472298	Tributes II: Remembering More of the Worlds Greatest Wrestlers (Wrestling Observer)	Books	5	18	18	N	N	Even Better Than Volume One!	Tributes II is a vast improvement over the original. As much as I enjoyed the first volume of \\"Tributes,\\" I feel it was riddled with way too many photographs at the expense of the stories. Several of the tributes ---most notably those of Giant Baba and Junkyard Dog--- were edited down from the original appearance in the Wrestling Observer Newsletter (not to mention the original \\"Grassroots\\" paperback publication of Tributes). In the case of the Junkyard Dog obituary, the omissions took out a lot of the emotion behind the story.    The appearance and text of Tributes II really shines. Dave Meltzer's journalism is every bit as sharp as before, but much less of his written word winds up on the cutting room floor to make room for the umpteenth full page color photo.    For those of you who have never read Dave Meltzer's work before, you will find that The Grim Reaper is often his finest muse. While a collection of obituaries might seem like a grim read to those unfamiliar with the inner workings of the pro wrestling industry, this is far from the case. Dave does an especially good job covering both the glory and complications in the life of a wrestler. You will read about wrestlers who lived long, fascinating lives (Freddie Blassie, Johnny Valentine, Stu Hart), as well as wrestlers who lived fast and fell hard (Davey Boy Smith, Hawk, Curt Hennig). Perhaps the most difficult read is the tribute to Owen Hart, who did not live fast, and whose tragic accident seemed preventable.    Bret Hart writes a particularly moving foreward to Tributes II, where he talks about the love/hate relationship he and other wrestlers had with Dave Meltzer's newsletter when it first became the rage in the mid 1980s. The wrestling community resented Meltzer for spilling the secrets of a tight-lipped industry, but its members were always asking fellow wrestlers if they had a copy of the current issue they could borrow. Hart tells about his own transformation from a hesitant Wrestling Observer reader to a wrestler who realizes that an insider sheet can benefit the wrestlers in an industry where the grapplers often get short changed by unscrupulous players.    A nice bonus is the DVD that accompanies the book, which has Meltzer sharing his thoughts on the wrestlers featured in this edition. When I popped the DVD in, I was expecting a 15 minute \\"take it or leave it\\" interview. I was pleasantly surprised to find there was a little over one hour of high quality interview time!    While the previous edition of Tributes is a must read, Tributes II immensely exceeds its depth and quality. If you want to shell out your money on only one edition, \\"Tributes II\\" wins by a wide margin.	2004-10-25

I enjoyed this book immensely, but Jerry Lawler's description of his early years in the business, coupled with the detailed look at Southern Pro Wrestling in the 1970s, absolutely stole the show for me. This book is invaluable for fans of the pro wrestling regional territories of days past, and Lawler recounts his experiences on both the mainstream and independent circuits of that era. <br /> <br />This book has great accounts of Southern Wrestling personalities like legendary heel Sam Oliver Bass, successful ---albeit eccentric, cheap and often irrational--- promoter Nick Gulas, and wrestler/promoter Jerry Jarrett. The book also has a look at the local promotional wars throughout the years, which is one of my favorite features in the book; with pro wrestling being a big-money corporate player these days, it is fascinating to see how profitable but homegrown promotions competed. <br /> <br />Jerry Lawler talks in detail about his problems with fidelity, the toll his fooling around had on the women in his life, and the confession that it is his only vice. While he places most of the blame on himself, and is very complimentary to most of the women in his life, it is interesting to read his comments on vices. He does not drink or drug, and claims sex as his only vice. At one point he says something to the effect that this particular addiction has no repercussions; well, maybe not on the brain cells or the liver, but he seems to be overlooking the emotional toll it took on his relationships. <br /> <br />When finishing this book, Jerry Lawler comes off overall as a good guy, who you would love to hang out with. About the only thing that did not click with me were the numerous bad one-liners. It's true that the bad jokes are part of his character and work well on WWE TV, but somehow the \\"joke within a joke\\" does not translate well into print. <br /> <br />If you love pro wrestling history as much as I do, this is a great and timeless read. The descriptions of old small town shows and Tennessee pop-culture are so tangible I found myself wishing I could be there. Pick this book up!	2004-10-09

That was exactly what I did the first time I read this novel nearly twenty five years ago; but after several years of lauding Franny and Zooey as the pinochle of Salinger's work, it dawned on me that while there are angry or confused youngsters who feel like societal misfits in each novel, they come from such different worlds that comparing the two stories is just, well... apples & oranges.  <br /> <br />What made Franny and Zooey more endearing to me was the family dynamics. In contrast to Catcher in the Rye's focus on Holden Caulfield's unhappiness as an individual, the nervous breakdown that Franny Glass suffers early in the story has more to do with being a member of the Glass Family than it does her individual anxieties. And unlike Holden, who is coping in the larger world, Franny suffers as a shut-in at the home she grew up in. <br /> <br />I believe that most people who have dealt with well meaning but misguided families will find themselves drawn toward this story. The Glass Family is one of the finest examples of a large and dysfunctional family (before it was cool to be dysfunctional), with an emotionally charged but diverse collection of grown children dealing with the complexeties of their upbringing. <br /> <br />The story focuses equally on Franny and her older brother Zooey. They are two youngest children in the Glass Family, raised by their parents and older siblings on vaudeville style entertainment, philosophy and intelligentsia. While Franny's breakdown seems a mystery to her and paralyzes her emotions, Zooey is pent up with anger and well too aware of the emotional wreckage their upbringing has left the Glass offspring to clean up. Feeling a bond with Franny as the two youngest children, Zooey wants to help his sister, but must first temper his rage and self destructive tendencies.  <br /> <br />Going into much more detail would be an injusticeto anyone who has yet to read this story. In my opinion, this is a classic story of twentieth century Americana. From Zooey's self loathing to the dialogue between him and his busy-body mother to Franny's aggravation with her boyfriend Lane, J.D. Salinger gives us a portrait of a family in crisis, unequaled until The Ramones recorded the dark comedic \\"We're a Happy Family\\" years later. And no, I'm not kidding!

This is the third work by Dashiell Hammett that I picked up, the others bein Red Harvest and The Dain Curse. While I enjoy Hammett's sharp and colorful prose, these stories left me wanting a little more. In the case of Red Harvest, the crooks and the gunfights had an over-the-top B-Movie essence; The Dain Curse has more of the same, with an extemely offensive racist portrayal of a character thrown in.  <br /> <br />The Thin Man marks the first time I have thoroughly enjoyed a Dashiell Hammett novel. The tale is told in the first person by Nick, who is a retired private eye who quit the business after marrying the independently wealthy Nora. Nick and Nora essentiality live life at parties or lazing at home, almost always with cocktails in hand. What makes this duo so charming is their easygoing marriage in which they display affection for one another more via wisecracks than kisses. On top of that, playful Nora is the one person who has Nick's number: he can say no to anything and anybody excepting his wife, for whom he is head over heels. <br /> <br />While Nick & Nora Charles are the characters who steal the spotlight, Hammett paints a fantastic array of characters involved in the disappearance of an eccentric inventor named Clyde Wynant, as well as the murder of his secretary. Most entertaining is the trio of Clyde's family: his ex-wife Mimi (a shallow woman who tries to lie her way out of trouble, with little success), son Gilbert (fragile inquisitive young man intrigued with detective work, human nature, and the effects that illegal drugs have on the mind and emotions), and Dorothy (manic young woman who recognizes her family's erratic behavior, but has trouble tempering her own identity).  <br /> <br />The majority of other characters are the colorful and pulpy gangsters, thugs, and cops. You will not find the coarse, gritty realism of a Raymond Chandler story. The Thin Man is more of a \\"Who Dunnit?\\" romp that deals with the collection of dysfunctional folks who have ties with the disappearance and the murder. <br /> <br />When all is said and done, Dashiell Hammett leaves \\"The Thin Man\\" as a solid packaging consisting of both his excellent descriptive writing and a well plotted story. This story, and nearly any Raymond Chandler novel, are good places to start if you are new to the detective fiction genre.	2004-09-22

When I came across this book, I picked it up, thinking it was a cute idea: a masked detective named X, who lives in a city of people whose identity lies in the masks they wear. I was pleasantly surprised to find out my \\"cute idea\\" thought was one of the biggest understatements my mind ever told me. <br /> <br />This is not just a great book focusing on pro wrestling (more specifically, Lucha Libre, the Mexican Style of Pro Wrestling), this is not just a great crime novel, this is not just just a great fantasy tale; this is a great novel that encompasses all these genres! <br /> <br />Christ Faust tells the story of Ms. X, a former luchadora (lady wrestler) who fell from grace in the professional Lucha Libre world, and now resides in Hoodtown, her old stomping grounds. Here she makes a modest living, still as a luchadora, but as a private luchadora, who dishes out hourly sessions to masochistic men who are thrilled to be smacked around by Ms. X. <br /> <br />Her new routine is interrupted when masked prostitutes in Hoodtown are found not only murdered, but left unmasked, which is every bit as horrible in itself as death. Ms. X becomes a self taught private eye searching for the killer since the police ---who do not reside in Hoodtown, and like most maskless people in this novel's society, spit upon masked folks as members of the lowest caste--- are nonchalant about finding the murderer. <br /> <br />Of all the great things I can say about this story, what floored me most is Christa Faust's ability to create a gritty but sexy heroine in Ms. X, and in quite a way that I've never seen before. X is no glamour girl, but a rubenesque middle-aged woman with aches & battle scars from her former professional life. Rather than turning her into a one-dimensional asexual gritty character, Faust's erotic segments brings out X's raw sexuality in a way the reader will find alluring. It seems like so much erotica is based on glamorous folk with lilywhite skin and flawless bods; Faust does an enviable job of taking a down-to-earth character with flaws, but still painting a sensual figure that will make any man wish that X was a real life woman they could meet in the flesh. For fans of Japanese Womens' wrestling, picture Bull Nakano as a detective!{Sigh!} <br /> <br />This is also the best novel I have ever read that is based on  professional wrestling. I have read one or two decent wrestling novels, a few mind-numbingly horrid wrestling novels, but this is the first great pro wrestling novel I have encountered.	2004-09-17

As always, Raymond Chandler's writing technique is excellent in \\"The Little Sister.\\" And while the premise is good--- a woman from Kansas coming to Philip Marlowe in hopes of locating her missing brother--- the story and its characters dissolve into eccentricity by the end of the book. <br /> <br />Chandler was such an excellent story teller, and part of his appeal was writing colorful mysteries that had the right mix of gritty reality and just a few dashes of improbable situations. The characters in this book start off well, but become more cartoonish as the story moves along. <br /> <br />In my opinion, there is  no terrible Raymond Chandler book, but this does come close. If you have never read any of Chandler's work, this may not be the best place to start. \\"Farewell, My Lovely\\" and \\"The High Window\\" would be my personal picks as his finest work, but any of his other novels are superior to this.	2004-09-17
US	52993541	R2EDUGHRRXXXDA	1591099498	559474634	So, You Want to be a Wrestling Promoter?	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A Good Read Before Taking "The Big Step."	Honestly, I approached this book with few expectations, and was pleasantly surprised to find a lot of useful information. If you have had some degree of experience in the wrestling industry, you are probably already aware of much of the information in this book. If, however, you have aspirations to become involved in pro wrestling as a business venture, this is a good book to pick up before taking the plunge. <br /> <br />What makes the book especially valuable is the candid portrayal of the wrestling business. Both Drasin and Collins make no bones that a lot of dishonest people ---be they promoters, wrestlers, or bookers--- do become involved in the biz. Nor do they try to convince you that promoting pro wrestling is a good avenue toward wealth. They illustrate the positives of the pro wrestling business without giving you delusions of grandeur. <br /> <br />The biggest surprise for me was the portion of the book written by Bruce Dwight Collins. Ric Drasin has been involved in the pro wrestling scene, and has long been wise and savvy to the business end. Collins, on the other hand, is a more recent inductee into the ranks of the independent wrestling promotion. His limited experience, and the fact that his rookie successes and mistakes are still fresh in his head, really gives the book a greater depth. <br /> <br />I'll be honest... when I came to the section written by Collins, I rolled my eyes when reading about his naive beginnings as an Internet wrestling enthusiast, and thought I was in for a long, cringe-inducing read. I've met more than a handful of Internet smarcks who fancy themselves rasslin' promoters, and many of these folks are delusional! Collins, however, appears to be one of the exceptions. In fact, by reeling in his ego and showing his innocent enthusiasm for pro wrestling in the beginning, Collins better illustrates the gradual transition from a starry-eyed fan to a realistic man of business. In between you read about the many unexpected obstaclesthat stand in a promoter's way, from no-show wrestlers to the petty battles brought about by jealous competing promoters. <br /> <br />Ric Drasin's experience in the business gives you a good idea about the industry's beginnings, how it has evolved into the present day, and his vision of pro wrestling's future direction. Drink in his information well, because Ric is a good independent promoter who preaches promoting with a rational mind versus getting carried away and spending mountains of cash on unnecessary accessories.  <br /> <br />My criticisms of this book are few, and are not significant enough to steer anybody away from the book. The aesthetics and the occasional typos give the book an amateurish look, especially the placing of an advertisement for a self defense device.  <br /> <br />The combination of Ric Drasin's experience and Bruce Dwight Collin's recent indoctrination are what makes this book a hit. If you want to become a wrestling promoter, this book is a good start. If you want to become a wrestler, this book is a good heads-up when dealing with promoters. Check it out! <br />	2004-08-08

Hiaasen can tell a story like an amped-up modern day Charles Dickens: the heroes are quite noble, the villains are thoroughly loathesome, and keen social commentary often moves his story.        Skinny Dip centers around Joey Perrone, an independently wealthy ---albeit gracious and civic minded--- woman, whose biologist husband, Chaz Perrone, attempts to murder her when he suspects that she has learned about his crooked dealings with Red Hammernut, a land baron with a penchant for abusing his farm workers, using fertilizers that are destroying the Everglades, and winning mountains of cash and political influence. Chaz believes his wife to be dead after he throws her overboard a cruise ship, but Joey survives, and keeps her survival a secret to all but a few people. As people mourn the death of Joey Perrone, Joey Perrone enlists the aid of Mick Stranahan. Together they haunt Chaz with subtle hints and tokens that make him wonder if his late wife might have survived the plunge, and is nearby lurking in the shadows.         What struck me early on in this book is Hiaasen's ability to paint tangible characters relying on more on their mores and mannerisms than their physical description. I found this to be especially true with the character of Chaz Perrone. Before reading too much about his physical stats, we get a thorough rundown of his lazy, selfish and devious traits. Those descriptions alone will probably have the face of someone you've known (hopefully not very well!) popping up in your head as the character of Chaz Perrone.         As with his past novels, Hiaasen packs this book with scores of eccentric characters on both sides of good and evil: Mick Stranahan, retired cop who rescues Joey; Tool, the monolithic henchman for Red Hammernut; Detective Karl Rolvaag, who has a fondness for snakes and a longing for his homeland in the Midwest; Corbett Wheeler, Joey's New Zealander brother who has concluded that lambs are nature's most noble creatures; and Ricca, Chaz's hairdresser lover, a perky spitfire who gets in deeper than she bargains for.         Similar to Raymond Chandler's home of Los Angeles, or Ken Kesey's Pacific Northwest, Carl Hiaasen describes the state of Florida vividly in his books. Skinny Dip is a fun plot packed with suspense, a colorful crew of characters, and a fun trip through the towns and Everglades of Florida.	2004-08-02
US	52993541	R3J926X4FKA0UI	068814151X	863921301	The Last Party: Studio 54, Disco, and the Culture of the Night	Books	5	35	35	N	N	Excellent Book, But Not For All Studio 54 Fans	This book is an excellent in-depth analysis of the New York City Nightworld from the disco-elite 1970s into the Club-Kids of the 1990s. The title might mislead readers into thinking this is &quot;The Studio 54 story.&quot; This book does not focus solely on the rise and fall of Studio 54. Anthony Haden-Guest focuses on the rise and fall of the entire NYC nightclub scene, with Studio 54's Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager taking center stage.      If you are looking for a book that mainly emphasizes the celebrities, the glitz, and wild parties in Studio 54, this book may not be your cup of tea. These topics are covered, but the book emphasizes the chaotic, competitive ---and often cutthroat--- business nature of nightclubs. In doing so, Haden-Guest does a great and even job of illustrating Nightworld's sharp businessmen, the starry-eyed dreamers, the junkies, the megalomaniacs, the doormen, and the party-goers. You read the frightening ups & downs of the business players, and their mad scrambles to try and duplicate the success of Studio 54. And often, some of these key players are all the abovementioned items rolled up into one.      I was surprised to read just how unstable the nightclub business was during this &quot;Boom&quot; period. There was no club that matched Studio 54's once-in-a-century money making machine. But even its best competitors found numerous obstacles in running a successful night-scene, and very few lasted more than two years. You will read about the fickle Nightworld party-goers, how they tired quickly of even the hottest parties, eventually abandoning the hot club in hopes of a newer, hotter nightspot.      It is equally astounding to see how many would be entrepreneurs sought funding to duplicate Studio 54's achievements; some well equipped, others incompetent. There are the brief triumphs of Maurice Brahms, the drive of Arthur Weinstein, the mixed success of Scotty Taylor, and the sad story of Uva Hardin, the volatile dreamer that never even got a club off the ground.      You do meet the charismatic characters that inhabited Studio 54 and the surrounding clubs, including Bianca Jagger, drug runner Tom Sullivan, Mark Benecke (probably the only guy who became famous for being a club doorman), club goer Tinkerbelle, Carmen D'Alessio, legendary attorney Roy Cohn, Rudolf and His Club Kids, and Halston. The author does not merely tell you the cool stories about their doings, he illustrates how they shaped Nightworld and/or how Nightworld shaped (and sometime damaged) them.      Haden-Guest paces the story of Rubell and Schrager's unexpected success very well. Their financial boom was so intense and happened so fast that both men failed to see the potential fallout. Like many club owners, they skimmed money, only Rubell and Schrager skimmed mountains more than the average club owner, and practically egged on the IRS to investigate them. The out of control egos, the delusion of being untouchable, is all too evident in this tale. The author also illustrates the irony in Studio 54's downfall, how if Rubell and Schrager reeled in their egos just a little bit, there is a chance the Saga of Studio 54 would be an ongoing success story today.      If I could point to the one thing that I enjoyed most about The Last Party, it would be the treatment of Steve Rubell. I have seen numerous articles and documentaries of the nightclub phenomenon that paints Rubell as an eccentric visionary, a maverick, a madman? and not much else. Haden-Guest does show us the manic & drugging Rubell, but we get a keen look at the soul behind the &quot;human perpetual-motion machine.&quot; Especially moving was that after numerous whirlwind career ups-&-downs and &quot;Hello & G'bye&quot; sexual encounters, Rubell, in the last years of his life, found love with Bill Hamilton.       If you are looking for a book on the glitz of Studio 54, a good source is the VH1 Behind the Music documentary aired around 1996-97. If you want an insightful lookinto the complex and unpredictable nature of the Nightworld phenomenon, this is the book for you.	2004-07-22

For those WWE fans who read the recent Hardy Boys autobiography, this is the same structure, but with a much larger cast of characters.<br />The legends who narrate the history include Mick McManus, Exotic Adrian Street, Max &amp; Brian Crabtree, Jackie Pallo, Pat Roach, Klondike Kate, Mitzi Mueller, Mal Sanders, Giant Haystacks, Big Daddy Crabtree, Kent Walton and scores more. Fond memories for England's wrestling fans, albeit melancholy to see how many interviewed in this book have passed away since its printing.<br />Included is the 1980s new-era crossroads when WWF put a new face on the business, and many imitators followed suit. It is interesting to read the old-school grapplers comments on the change the biz went through. Included are players of the 1990s like Shawn Michaels and Davey Boy Smith. <br />Not as deep a search into the mechanics and soul of the biz as many authors have done since, but a high quality read. Essential for anybody who wants to become a thorough historian of the pro wrestling business.	2004-07-20
US	52993541	RF9P9QP06TF3B	0743456912	266732750	Ric Flair: To Be the Man (WWE)	Books	5	4	8	N	N	One Of The Very Best!	Whether you like your pro wrestling old school or contemporary, there is no better era when it comes to pro wrestling and the written word. We've shifted from the era of the 1970s pure fiction wrestling magazines of Bill Apter to the &quot;Smart-Sheet&quot; newsletters of the 80s and 90s to the present era of the realistic tell-all mainstream wrestling media. Rather than read about wrestlers' in-ring feuds as if they were reality, we read about an industry where athletes work together in the ring, but still have to compete with promoters and each other on the political front of the business. <br />That said, there are some books that are more straightforward than others. Mick Foley, Dynamite Kid, Jack Brisco and the late Freddie Blassie delivered very frank and thorough examinations of their lives as pro wrestlers. The autobiographies by Hulk Hogan and The Rock, on the other hand, were entertaining but filled with overblown claims and inaccuracies. <br />Ric Flair &quot;To Be The Man&quot; is one of those biographies that ranks up there with the very best. What makes the book so powerful is Flair's ability to step away from Ric Flair himself, and look at the complete picture that is his life and career. We already know Ric Flair as one of the greatest workers in history. In this book, Flair shows us the drive and confidence that made him the legend he is, but he also reveals the doubts, anxieties and near emotional breakdowns that could have derailed a great career. Ric Flair probably could have easily got away with writing a feel-good bio that showed only the happy-go-lucky &quot;Nature Boy,&quot; but in being brave enough to examine his life and times in a three-dimensional fashion, has given us one of the best illustrations of the highs and lows of being a celebrity in one of entertainment's most unique industries.<br />Ric Flair fans will read the in-depth firsthand accounts of the stories they have heard throughout the years, from the 1975 plane crash that could have ruined his career, to the wild road trips and parties with the likes of Harley Race and Terry Funk, to his off-the-chart matches with Ricky Steamboat, the behind-the-scenes office struggles with Dusty Rhodes and Eric Bischoff. He also goes into great detail about the military regimen that was Vern Gagne's training camp, a wrestling school so brutal he tried to quit on two different occasions. If not for Vern Gagne walking right up to Ric's doorstep, practically dragging him back into the gym and refusing to let him quit, we may have never seen Ric Flair's reign! <br />Flair is also very candid about the pluses and minuses of his career. While he loved the party animal life, the drinking and the womanizing, it was at the cost of his personal relationships at home. Ditto the 24/7 schedule that pro wrestlers live. It is admirable that rather than write a melodramatic condemnation of the workaholic &amp; party animal lifestyle, he cautions that such a full-throttle lifestyle can be taxing on the family at home.<br />Like Jack Brisco's recent autobiography, Flair does a great job illustrating what a stressful job being the NWA Heavyweight Champion was. He also shows that becoming #1 in the wrestling business does not ensure that you will keep the spot for long. Politics, delusions, nepotism, and jealousy are always there to yank the alpha-cat off his throne.<br />Flair appears to dish out criticism quite fairly, with the exception of Bret Hart, as Flair judges him as exploiting Owen Hart's death. Agree or disagree, his judgment of Hart as a wrestler seems fair game, but to publicly question Hart's motives regarding the loss of a family mamber was cold. While Flair lashes out at folks like Hulk Hogan and Vince Russo, he does not trash them, and goes out of his way to point out their strengths. Similarly, he clearly differentiates between what he sees as a good wrestler, a good wrestling personality, and a great all-around wrestler. He delivers high praise for wrestlers like Steamboat, Eddie Guerrero and Harley Race, and displays the important role that people like Gordon Solie and Jim Ross play in making pro wrestling complete.<br />This is one of those books I want to go out of my way to recommend. It is especially essential reading for anybody who  considers entering the wrestling business since it shows the complexeties of an entertainment industry that too many people discount as simple. I admired Flair before reading this book, and I admire him two-fold after turning the last page.	2004-07-11

If Dr. Frankenstein had worked with paper instead of body parts, he'd have been a collage artist. I use a scalpel, but instead of stitches I use glue.&quot; ---Winston Smith, page 22 in &quot;Act Like Nothing's Wrong.&quot;<br />Odds are you have seen Winston Smith's collage art. If you never perused the insane Winston Smith creations on Dead Kennedys' album covers (not to mention the infamous Dead Kennedys' DK logo), you have probably ran across his sweetly twisted magazine art collages somewhere in the media. Chances are you may have seen an image like &quot;Force Fed War&quot; (Mom nursing baby with a fighter aircraft instead of a bottle) or the various Reagan-Ridiculing collages. And there's a good chance you associate these collages with Jello Biafra and The Dead Kennedys, but have never actually heard the name of the creator, Winston Smith.<br />My case exactly. The Dead Kennedys collage art that stayed cemented in my mind was &quot;The Money Tree&quot; (page 26 in this collection), a collage of exuberant aging suburbanites, dressed in their weekend leisure slacks, harvesting dollar bills from a tree in their backyard. I always found that image simultaneously drop-dead funny and creepy, like a weird scene from a nightmare you had as a child. Eager to find that image again, I did the various web searches to find out what inspired mind came up with these freaky slices of life, and came across these books by Winston Smith.<br />I expected this book to be a funny collection of pop-art. This book goes way beyond my expectations. Not only are there scores of hysterical collages lambasting the seedy nature behind the nuclear family's jubilant appearance, but you have written commentary by Smith, who delivers a keen and serious attack on modern American society. The combination of his visual wit and his heartfelt criticism of the government (he focuses on our government, but does not let other monolithic empires like Chinaand the former USSR off the hook) drive this work home. This makes for an unlikely but effective mix of wit and condemnation.<br />It's really strange. I usually can't stand the artistic coffee-house malcontents who drone on and on about the tragedies of consumerism, sell-outs, and suburbia. I find the majority of those I have met to be self-serving critics who will cry over societal ironies, but only to come off as cool and bohemian.<br />Winston Smith is one major exception to the rule. As I read his commentaries, he probably would take me to task for writing off the angry neo-artists. He would probably also take me to task for being shallow enough to enjoy the fruits of popular TV &amp; media. So.... what is it I find different about Mr. Smith? As I read his quotes, I envision a guy who can find gloom and pathos in modern America, and then tell its story by cutting &amp; pasting magazine illustrations with childlike enthusiasm. Maybe I'm misreading Winston Smith, but I see this energetic workhorse who sees the empire crumbling into oblivion and instead of sobbing over it, he's going to play his fiddle louder, harder, and with sheer reckless abandon.<br />I love this book. And so should you! Give it a shot.	2004-07-01

TV appearance shortly before he won the NWA title in 1973. I was 10 years old, a novice wrestling fan, and two things immediately impressed me about him: how quick he was in the ring compared to the other L.A. wrestlers (the only wrestler in L.A. who moved at his pace---at least through this ten year old's eyes!--- was journeyman Raul Mata), and how cool it was to see such a pure athlete with long hair! Obviously, I had little understanding of the wrestling biz and the art of working a match, so I could only sum up Jack Brisco by saying \\"He's way cooler than the rest!\\" <br />Throughout the years I became better equipped to describe why Jack Brisco was way cooler, and I had great respect for him. Along comes the book \\"Brisco: The Life and Times of National Collegiate and World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion Jack Brisco,\\" and now I have even greater respect for him.<br />\\"Brisco\\" is one of those books that is a good read whether you are a die-hard wrestling fan or a reader who knows nothing about the pro wrestling business. The catch-phrases and details of the business are explained without going over the novice's head.<br />The book is told in the first person with Bill Murdock as editor. Jack Brisco presents himself as very confidant in his skills, but never goes over the line as a braggart, but as a team player. The list of people he credits with molding him into a successful wrestler, businessman and person is vast. He describes his counterparts honestly, neither deifing or trash-talking wrestlers and promoters. The first example that jumps into my mind is his description of the late Eddie Graham. He credits Graham as giving him his most important boost in his professional career, and his stubborn campaigning to crown Brisco as the next NWA Heavyweight Champion. On the flip side, he made no bones about Eddie pocketing more than his lion's share of his profits, and paying the wrestlers less than they deserved.<br />One of the most moving accounts of people he credits with helping his way up the success ladder comes when he speaks of Joe Scarpa AKA Jay Strongbow. Scarpa took Brisco under his wing like a father. He not only stood up for Jack when wrestlers messed with him, but he also dished out tough love when Brisco was acting out of line. He taught him the art of being a babyface (the hero--- there's more to it than non-wrestling fans realize) and the \\"babyface comeback.\\"<br />The first thing that pleasantly surprised me in this book came when Mr. Brisco spoke glowingly of Haystack Calhoun. While I have always been a fan of the ace amateur wrestlers and/or shooters, I was always turned off by their closed-window view of what pro wrestling should be. Case in point are two other excellent books, \\"Hooker\\" by Lou Thesz, and \\"Pure Dynamite\\" by Dynamite Kid, where the authors often sounded dismissive of wrestlers who were not 100% athleticism. I do not mean this to disrespect Lou Thesz or Dynamite Kid, but merely to point out that pro wrestlers are, and always have been, a diverse group of performers, and that the gimmick wrestlers are part of the business. Obviously, he did not laud Calhoun for his wrestling ability, but for his ability to get the fans jazzed when his 600+ frame was about to squash the ring's villains. Brisco also described Haystack Calhoun's optimistic nature and his willingness to spend time giving autographs for the fans. I know I'm probably driving this point into the ground, but it is awesome to see a serious wrestler like Brisco to take note and point out the contributions of a \\"gimmick wrestler.\\"<br />Brisco describes in detail the complexities of a business many non-wrestling fans see as simple, from the politics wrestlers have to practice and endure to dealings with uncouthe promoters. Like Lou Thesz did in \\"Hooker,\\"  Brisco tells in great detail the stressful schedule he endured after becoming NWA Heavyweight champion, always keeping up onflight schedules, finding time to keep in shape on top of the travel, and racing from state to state to make a title defense. Brisco's best told travel fiasco in the book has got to be the disastrous flight to Alabama when one of the landing gears would not work, and the pilot's neanderthol attempt to repair in front of the passengers!<br />My only complaint? I would love to see this book marketed more aggressively. \\"Brisco\\" should be required reading for all wrestling fans, as well as anybody who wants to enter the wrestling biz. This is definitely on my \\"top 5\\" list of books on pro wrestling.	2004-05-13

For the most part, good books on Zen click with me. The thing is, though... the void surrounding that &quot;for the most part&quot; is glaring at times. The authors often come from a landscape so esoteric or removed from the average Joe-&amp;-Jane's real life situation. Two contemporary writers of Zen I enjoy most are Charlotte Joko Beck and the late Alan Watts, yet when I read them, I can't help but picturing myself next to Alen Ginsburg on a houseboat in Sausalito, or eating macrobiotic rice at The Yogic-Yogurt Cafe in some land like Santa Cruz or La Jolla. It's not that I dislike these notions, but they are so far removed from my reality. I got much a lot out of these books, but a little something was missing.<br />I browsed through Hardcore Zen by Brad Warner. I was initially drawn to the funky cover and thought &quot;Oh cute... another book on 'Zen For the Western Mind.&quot; Nope. This book is much more than a cute punk-themed book cover.<br />Flipping through the pages, I was amazed to find that this Zen practitioner made references to several major pop-culture icons that I could really relate to. I thought I was the only American from my generation who remembered the episode of Ultraman where a funeral service is held for the scores of space monsters that Ultraman had to kill. Nor did I expect to see a reference to that cringe-inducing 1982 CHIPS episode where evil punk rockers terrorized the Battle of the Bands with their ode &quot;I Dig Pain!&quot; <br />These references to modern media moguls, from Henry Rollins to Ed Wood to Godzilla, are not just trivial inserts serving as a gimmick for a &quot;Zen Book O' the Week&quot; favorite. Brad Warner applies these references to everyday life as many middle class Americans know it. You can toss your MTV memorabilia and Cristina Aguilera posters away and eat all the tofu you please, but let's not pretend we were never reared on TV, rock music and Sugar Pops, because most of us ---even the ones going to Veganville--- love our pop culture.<br />If you are searching for a book on Zen that will take your soul flying into the astral plane or seeing rainbow-colored deities, well... this book is not for you. Warner is a Zen priest, coming from the mindset that Zen is reality, Zen is what's here &amp; now. The &quot;here &amp; now&quot; is one of the things that has drawn me to books on Zen, and Warner illustrates this very well. There has been so much written on &quot;embracing the mundane,&quot; but this one will make sense to anyone who has grown up in American cities and suburbs. Warner shows reality as both exciting and drab, and expresses the notion of &quot;embracing the mundane&quot; in ways that really hits home.<br />Warner also addresses the dangers of searching for divine intervention, or states of higher consciousness. Namely, he shows how there are plenty of people out there who pass themselves off as enlightened gurus or prophets of God, and how easily they can exploit and harm insecure people searching for spiritual comfort. Charismatic folks are experts at looking &quot;realized &amp; actualized,&quot; often promising you the answers to fulfillment. Religious manipulation is a personal pet peeve of mine, and I was pleased to see it discussed in depth. While I won't thumb my nose at anyone's personal religious faith, I am very leery of organized religion, be it a small church or a city-sized temple, especially when a handful of folks claim to give you all the answers. I was equally refreshed to find no sly mention in the backpages of a &quot;Brad Warner Fulfillment Community&quot; or similar money machine. Warner tells it as he sees it, and moves on.<br />What else can I say? Well, lots... there are enough kudos to cover five or six more pages, but I will stop here. This book is totally boss! I will likely read it several times over, but right now I'm going to embrace the moment my way, doing my Hindu Squats while watching tapes of All-Japan Womens' Wrestling and Lucha Libre on TV, then winding things up with a protein drink and Conan O'Brien on the tube. Read this book, it is a surprising treat.	2004-05-05

I was expecting something entertaining, perhaps crass and cutting edge, but I was floored to find a really great piece of work by Dee Dee Ramone.<br />Where do I start? How do I categorize this book? Horror? Humor? Autobiography? All of the above, I must say. Part Dante's Inferno, part Kafka's Metamorphosis, part Phillip K. Dick's \\"A Scanner Darkly,\\" yet all Dee Dee Ramone. I'm serious! My major in college was Comparative Literature, and reading Chelsea Horror Hotel brought me back to the most beautifully twisted examples of literature, both classic and modern, that I have read. Put Dante Alighieri and Franz Kafka in a time machine, point them toward CBGB's, and you're there!<br />Dee Dee Ramone sets himself as the central character, shacking up with his girl Barbara and dog Banfield at The Chelsea Hotel, New York's hang-out for the underground hipsters. It is also the site where Sid Vicious killed Nancy Spungeon in the late 1970s. <br />The entire story takes you through Dee Dee's paranoia of AIDS, perpetual quest to shoot up, repeated encounters with ghosts of dead friends like Sid Vicious and Stiv Bators, bloody murders, the awareness of a secret Satanic society that conducts grisly tortures in the hotel basement, and occasional desperate plea-bargains with God. What makes this story so twisted is the coming and goings of the \\"fine lines.\\" There are times when it is clear that a segment is grounded in Dee Dee's light grip on reality, but these moments often morph into disturbing paranormal events that seem to indicate that Dee Dee is swimming through a blurry array of nightmares, drug induced hallucinations, sheer paranoia, or improbable realities. It's often hard to tell! Yet the reader is never lost; you will find yourself racing through the pages, eager to see how each frightening misadventure is solved. <br />Part of what makes this story work so well is that while Dee Dee is the main focus of the story,he avoids painting himself as a sympathetic character. He portrays himself as a borderline sort who, despite frequent self-serving and malicious actions, believes that he is a nice person who is wronged and agitated by all who surround him. He does an excellent job of illustrating an individual who is emotionally tormented and forever craving a fix. Unlike so many \\"street poets,\\" you see no glamour in his crack & heroin surroundings; you see one great big nightmare. <br />Nightmarish from start to finish, yes. Strange thing is, despite the desperation throughout the novel, I did not find it depressing in the least. I found myself impatient to get to the next page, just to see the next twisted mess Dee Dee would get himself into.<br />And forget the lame anti-drug films our health teachers showed us throughout our junior high years; \\"Chelsea Horror Hotel\\" would make me steer clear of the rock, the pipe, and the needle FOR GOOD!<br />One caution: this book is not for the weak of heart (or stomach). Lots of graphic descriptions of blood, vomit, and millions of grotesque mealie-mealie bugs! <br />\\"Chelsea Horror Hotel\\" is Dee Dee's crowning bookshelf glory. It may not be a bestseller, but I hope it nevers fades into complete obscurity. Dee Dee Ramone may be gone from this world, and I hope he's at peace in a much more placid setting than The Chelsea Horror Hotel!	2004-03-25

This is one of those well written biographies of the present day that captures my attention like few others: a well researched, well investigated study of a life that was encompassed with scores of urban myths and mock-biographies. Emily Leider does an excellent job both desconstructing the myths surrounding Rudolph Valentino's life, and explaining just how calculated many of the legends and misrepresentations were.<br />It's shocking, even in this day and age of papparazzis and tabloids, to read about the publicity machines involved in the silent stars. We read not only about the energetic fans and jealous critics of Valentino's celebrity, but the obsession his own employers had with controlling his public behavior to the point of sending private detectives to spy in on his every move.<br />Ms. Leider did well in portraying Valentino as a real human being rather than a man defined by his alluring mystique. She clearly illustrates the labor, the strokes of luck, the blunders, and often the tedium involved in Rudolph Valentino's  climb to stardom. While many have seen Valentino the Lover, we read about the years he spent barely making a living as a dancer; the numerous bit roles and stereotypical \\"exploitive foreigner\\" roles he had to play; his naivete, along with the insecurity and heartbreak he experienced with Jean Acker and Natacha Rambova, all the while being known as the ultimate Casanova. <br />Rudolph Valentino's real life was legitimately fascinating without having to exaggerate his ups and downs. While it can be said he had much enjoyment and adventures few got to experience, it is difficult to read how many of his tragedies come about by close friends (and even his first wife Jean Acker) who use his celebrity for their own gains. Particularly appalling is the account of a friend who, after Valentino's death, exploits the auctioning of his estate's items.<br />The rumors of Valentino's marriage to Natacha Rambova as being \\"a marriage of convenience\\" are cleared up too. There were several sources and write-ups throughout the years citing both parties as gay, and the marriage as being a cover up. While Ms. Leider does say it is likely both were bisexual, their love and passion for each other was very real. She also illustrates how their working too closely in the same business strained, and eventually destroyed, their marriage.<br />If there is one criticism I would zero in on, it is the frequent over-analysis of Rudolph Valentino's films. This is not to say that the stories and motivations behind the films are not interesting, and much of it is key to the story of Rudolph Valentino himself; there is just a bit too much space devoted to the many intricate details of the films' plots and backstories. <br />If you want a biography that deifies its subject, this is not the book for you. This book shows us the complexeties of the Rudolph Valentino who at times was quite naive, but also aware of how superficial and misleading fame could be. Emily Leider did such an excellent job showing us the three-dimensional Rudolph Valentino, that I'm going to begin reading her biography of Mae West very soon.	2004-03-14

This guy is to current events what Ken Burns is to documentaries; he can take any subject, dig into it, and narrate in a compelling way that few people can.<br />I highly recommend reading \\"Dr Dealer\\" and then follow it up with \\"Killing Pablo.\\" Originally written in 1987 (this edition has a 2001 epilogue), Bowden follows an unlikely cocaine dealer in Larry Lavin, a preppy dental student who loves the maverick thrill of coke dealing, yet also enjoys the high-scale suburban American lifestyle. This book emphasizes Lavin's naive rationale that while cocaine is illegal, it is a high society party drug that was accepted by a wide variety of socialites (remember when it was called the \\"Champagne of Drugs?\\"), and figured that he wasn't hurting anybody by supplying it to people who sought it out. And that seems to be the consensus of his fellow upscale dealers and clients, up until their arrests. \\"Who are we hurting\\" seems to be the dealers' key question.<br />Which is why \\"Killing Pablo\\" is a great companion piece to \\"Doctor Dealer.\\" The story of the hunt for Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar paints a polar opposite portrayal of the cocaine trade. There are no preppy dentists, no white-collar style arrests; you see a multitude of Colombian citizens, from police to politicians to everyday folks from every walk of life, murdered by Colombian drug cartels. It is a brutal answer to the \\"Who are we hurting?\\" question, and Bowden does that very well.<br />Larry Lavin is a fascinating character, but not to the point that you feel sympathy for him. The more he succeeds in the illegal drug trade, the more arrogant he becomes, and the more risks he takes. On the other hand, he is not a ruthless Pablo Escobar who executes every \\"John Q Citizen\\" that he thinks might dislike him. In fact, he never kills anyone, nor even roughs anybody up. There are segments where you see some very likable and sincerely charitable sides of Larry Lavin, but they are overshadowed by the con that he truly is.<br />Bowden very successfully illustrates all of Lavin's fellow dealers, family and underlings, and which ones had a hand in his undoing and why. You see eccentric socialite Mark Stewart con the cons, and you will shake your head in disbelief and frustration when reading about Lavin's wife Marcia, how she stands by her man. <br />If it weren't for a few of the key players' fumbles, one might wonder if Larry Lavin would have eventually walked away from the cocaine trade unscathed. And while covered only minutely, you will see what role Frankie Smith played in exposing Larry Lavin and Co. to the IRS (yes, the same Frankie Smith who recorded \\"The Double Dutch Bus!\\")Mark Bowden even talks about his own personal opportunity to deal marijuana in college (which is how Larry Lavin started) and the temptation to make that quick money, but wisely deciding against it, leaving him years later to wonder if he could have stumbled into the same dangerous trap Larry Lavin thrust himself into.<br />This is just one of Mark Bowden's great works, and a good place to start if you want to add them to your library.	2004-02-07
US	52993541	R20QVVMN21ZWK9	1550225847	678921241	Wrestlecrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Impressive!	First off, I have never visited the Wrestlecrap Website. That said, when I heard about the premise of this book, I was expecting a slightly amusing look at bad gimmicks like \\"The Red Rooster.\\" I was surprised to find that this book gave more than lists and photos of outrageously horrid characters. \\"Wrestlecrap\\" is so much more. This book ponders the thought process of the higher-ups in WCW and WWF. It describes gimmicks that were created for personal satisfaction rather than business savvy, gimmicks that were created out of desperation rather than creativity, and bad gimmicks that the promoters honestly thought were brilliant. Best of all, I found this book to be more than just slightly amusing; this book is hysterical!<br />Wrestlecrap primarily focuses from the mid 1980s to the present, when Vince McMahon Jr gave pro wrestling a brand new paint job, and how folks like WCW's Jim Herd tried to \\"outcamp\\" the WWF with disastrous results. While I've read countless articles presenting icons like McMahon as everything from innovative to cutthroat to no-nonsense maverick, it's not very often you get to read a detailed report on the many blunders that go on amidst the successes, in the ring and behind the dressing room curtain. Yes, we know multiple Doink the Clowns were lame, how embarrassing the fake Razor Ramon & Diesel was, or how we cringed at WCW's \\"Wonderful World of Oz.\\" But Wrestlecrap goes into great detail about the geniuses who dreamed these angles up, why they expected them to work, why they didn't work. We read about backstage politics, and how some promoters created bad gimmicks specifically to make the wrestlers they disliked personally look bad. The author is also humble enough to point out a gimmick that, considering how way-out it was, should have failed, but instead became one of the most successful pro wrestling personas of all time: The Undertaker.<br />Early on in the book, Reynolds and Baer appropriately take the heat off the wrestlers for performing these gimmicks, since they are performing a job at the booker's request. <br />The point of wrestlers following the orders of the promoters is driven home in the book's forward, which is written by John \\"Earthquake\\" Tenta. Tenta was a Sumo and legit tough guy long before he became Earthquake. Even with that reputation, he did not hesitate, when asked, to dress up like \\"The Shark\\" or as Golga of The Oddities (confession time---I think we all have at least one \\"Wrestlecrap Guilty Pleasure\\"...mine is The Oddities!). In a business where big egos and dressing room hissyfits can make headaches for promoters, Tenta is a breath of fresh air. He stresses that wrestlers have to make do with the personas given them, and give it their best shot, and that for every \\"Stone Cold\\" Steve Austin created, there are a hundred \\"Sharks.\\" He is able to laugh at the bad gimmicks he did, as well as laugh at himself. John Tenta, despite being a Sumo, obviously never thought that the wrestling business was \\"beneath him\\" unlike many folks in the biz. For this, I take my hat off and salute John Tenta.<br />This book is a shockingly wonderful book, and highly recommended for anyone who wants to see the rationale behind bad decisons!	2004-01-17

Adamson's first Billy Chaka adventure gives you a high-speed tour through Tokyo. What makes this book so fun is the character of Billy Chaka, a modern day Philip Marlowe minus the caustic edge. Add that he is not a professional detective, but a journalist for &quot;Asian Youth&quot; magazine; it's his feline curiosity over a slick Geisha that hurls him into a cloak &amp; dagger chase involving Yakuza, a religious cult, a Speed Tribe (teen bikers) and an honest-to-god private detective.<br />The heart of this book is fun &amp; mystery, but Adamson does a great job of painting Billy Chaka as a youthful adult nearing the cusp of middle age. You see a streetwise and all too curious man, halfway to that cynical Marlowe persona, but still maintaining a youthful inquisitiveness and an uncontrollable desire for Geisha!<br />Only drawback is enough typos to be noticeable, but not enough to dilute such a fantastic tale. Check this book out, you won't be disappointed.	2003-07-28

I just finished reading this book, and have gone from being a casual Ramones fan to an intense fan and great admirer of the band. Everett True did an awesome job showing how The Ramones functioned as individuals and as a group.<br />What fascinated me is how the group stayed together for over twenty years, functioning as a band despite intense differences. Each member seemed to have a different vision, temperment and political stance, but they remained professional enough to keep working hard and cranking out great music. <br />True shows liberal Joey, Johnny the ultra-conservative; Dee Dee and Joey the artists, Johnny the workhorse who at times seemed like the \\"disciplinary glue\\" that kept the band well-marketed and organized. We see Tommy, who intrigued me the most as he tired of being an active member early on, but stayed involved with the band's production throughout the years. You see the out-of-control sides of Marky and Dee Dee, and the different recovery trips they sought. Band members often fought and held grudges, but rarely did it effect their professional work. Despite a cult following without huge record sales, these guys kept working hard. <br />True also put good effort into showing us the unsung members like CJ and Ritchie, and he shows how various crew members and artists worked as a family. <br />The book's only flaw is a biggie. True frequently cites what the band's best work is as if his personal likes are the final word. This does not happen once or twice, but throughout the book. Annoying! HOWEVER--- to his credit, he did print viewpoints that conflicted with his own, and he did so without discounting each person's word. I honestly can overlook Everett True's subjective flaw, because the work he put into this book is incredible. You can tell that he was a huge Ramones fan from day one, yet was focused enough to paint both their glory and their shortcomings.<br />Judging from other interviews I read with Johnny Ramone, I get the feeling that Everett True painted Johnny as more of a \\"hardnose bust-yer-chops\\" type than he actually is. Still, he did show Johnny's near military disclipline may be part of what kept the Ramones professional and reliable.<br />If you've never even heard of the Ramones, I recommend this book. You will read a fascinating account of a rock band that, conflicting individual dynamics, became a cohesive and legendary rock group.	2003-07-19

I am one of those lucky Southern California wrestling fans who was raised on Hollywood, beaches, and the famous Blassie vs Tolos feud. I became a bonafide pro wrestling fanatic, but even fellow SoCalifornians from my generation who had little interest in the rasslin' biz remember the Freddie Blassie vs John Tolos era. When I heard about WWE's release of Blassie autobiography, I wondered whether it would be a quality work or a mildly entertaining work of semi-fiction.<br />In the tradition of recent pro wrestling releases, this book delivers a colorful yet insightful look into Blassie's life and career. Just like Dynamite Kid's autobiography, a nod should be given to ghostwriter Keith Greenberg for capturing Blassie's unique diction in print. This did not work with Hulk Hogan's recent book, as the repeated Hogan catch phrases just came off as comical. With Blassie, you could swear you could hear his gruff ---sometimes crass--- voice narrating his life, without diverting attention to the story. You will read an honest account from a man who is proud of his acheivements, but not too proud to admit to his shortcomings. He is macho, yet not ashamed to talk about moments that moved him to tears. His devotion to his wife Miyako moved me above all.<br />Freddie Blassie makes no bones about who he loves and hates. His fond recollections of Nikolai Volkoff, Stepfather Eli, Stepsister Antoinette, and Andy Kaufman are very moving (even to the most cynical wrestling fan!). He does not mince words when ranting on the displeasures of working with Mike LaBell, Johnny Valentine and Antonio Inoki. Reading these in Blassie's voice makes the read a fun ride.<br />Being such a huge Freddie Blassie and L.A. Wrestling fan, it's hard for me to step back and judge whether this book will be as entertaining to a casual fan who knows little about &quot;The King of Men.&quot; Mick Foley's &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; still reigns (in my opinion) as the best overall look at one man's rise from the small time to stardom. While Blassie's book is more of a personal narrative, there is still enough basic information to supply the casual wrestling fan with an overview of pro wrestling lingo, background and inner workings. My hunch is that a reader who never heard of Freddie Blassie will feel great affection for him by the final page of the book.<br />Other unique and hep features include firsthand narratives about Blassie by folks like Volkoff, John Tolos, Johnny Legend, George Steele, and son Ron Blassie. <br />Personally, I was really jazzed to hear him praise the late Ray Mendoza as both an athlete and a human being. Mendoza, while a legend in Mexico, is too often overlooked in other countries. Mr. Blassie, I salute you!	2003-05-11

This is one of those books I read on a whim, and I'm very glad that I did. The character of Kate Brannigan has become one of my favorite private eyes (Philip Marlowe is still my number one) over the few days it took me to finish the story. Kate is perky, polite with words but pleasantly cynical in thought. Her workout of choice is kickboxing, but Ms. McDermid doesn't turn it into an over-the-top [method] of destruction while encountering no-goodnicks in puruit of her cases. She has a [carefree] rock journalist boyfriend who enjoys smoking [illegal substances], and their greatest bond seems to be the perpetual quest for palatable Chinese food.<br />This is the first work I have read by V.L. McDermid, and I absolutely love her story telling, characters and use of dialogue from start to finish. The spark of the novel is an odd case of disappearing and/or phantom conservatories; a bland subject to start with, but blends into a fascinating tale of low profile [con] artists. Detective Brannigan is close friends with a lesbian couple, and I love how Ms. McDermid introduces them as one would introduce any loving couple, without trying to make contrived statements regarding alternative lifestyles.<br />The only thing that keeps me from delivering that final fifth star is the proofreading. There are enough typos and errors in this edition that it really started to make a great story look, at times, amateurish on paper. I rarely make an issue when I see a typo here and there, but the frequency of mistakes here was distracting.<br />Do not let that criticism stop you from picking up this book. The pace, characters and plot twists keep this story slick! I plan to read every Kate Brannigan caper in existence.	2003-01-20

If you are a studied wrestling fan who knows the story of Vince McMahon and the modern day wrestling industry wars, you might find yourself wishing this book had at least another fifty pages with more details. <br />The length and condensation of WWF/WWE/McMahon history, however, is this book's strong point for the casual or non wrestling fan. The authors know how to present a brief but focused synopsis of pro wrestling's roots, introduce the reader to the terminology and ways of the biz, and give a clear vision of the WCW/WWF industry war without taking the focus off of Vince McMahon. While I would love to read a 1,500 text on pro wrestling history, this book is the perfect synopsis for somebody who wants a balanced introduction to one of the most intriguing forms of entertainment.<br />About the only point where I cringed a bit was when boxing promoter Bob Arum was quoted, claiming that Antonio Inoki wore spikes on his boots to injure Ali in their 1976 wrestler vs boxer fiasco. Assael was smart, however, to leave it as a statement in quotations by Arum himself (as opposed to Assael writing it as a historical fact). While that silliness did not ruin (or even dent) the foundation of the book, the quote came off badly. <br />Books on the pro wrestling business have come a long way in the last decade. This is definitely a top 10 pick!	2002-08-15

While I'm not familiar enough with bodybuilding to verify or deny the accuracy of the complex usage of steroids, diuretics, and tanning methods portrayed in the book (though if I was the gambling type, I would bet the author is on the money!), this is a great story that vividly portrays members of a subculture that would go to extreme and destructive lengths to acheive their goals.<br />Katie Arnoldi beautifully creates seedy characters. Their repulsive nature is so tangible and horrifying (especially Charles, the weasely perveted bodybuilding sponsor) that you feel like washing your hands between reads! If you're a writer who wants to brandish an effective villain, I highly recommend reading this book.<br />I also enjoyed Arnoldi's full-speed pace in telling the story of Aurora, a womens' pro bodybuilding hopeful. Many of the chapters are no more than two pages, yet the author manages to paint up the scene with vibrant characters, sensations and crossroads. Ms. Arnoldi has the art of telling a story down pat, and I hope we see more of her work in the future.<br />Even the finish of the story is in high gear. She winds up the story with a definite and clear ending, yet you hope for a sequel because there are still many possibilities for many of the characters. High energy book; don't read around bedtime, cuz it's a page turner that will keep you awake!	2002-04-23

This is the ultimate coffee table book if you are (a) a fan of the Los Angeles pro wrestling scene circa 1960s-70s and/or (b) a fan of the hot & steamy apartment house wrestling pictorials that appeared in \\"Victory Sports\\" magazines during the 1970s.<br />Fans who frequented the Olympic Auditorium most likely remember seeing Theo Ehret snapping photos at ringside. The introduction of this book includes an interview with Ehret in which he says that pro wrestling held absolutely no fascination for him; he was a photographer, and that was his job. So here's a wonderful irony, that a guy with no passion for the wrestling industry publishes a book that vividly captures the height of Southern California's pro wrestling heyday.<br />The superstars who personify 1970s L.A. wrestling are all here: Freddie Blassie, John Tolos (for those of you who remember the Blassie-Tolos feud, the photo of John Tolos jumpstarting the war by throwing the blinding powder into Blassie's eyes is included!), Mil Mascaras, The Sheik, Superstar Billy Graham, Dr. Jerry Graham, Andre the Giant, Antonio Inoki and many, many more!<br />If you are offended by adult entertainment or the erotic apartment house wrestling phenomenon that was hot in the 1970s, this book is definitely not for you. If you are a fan, this is paydirt! These \\"Pulp Mag\\" style nude photo essays were all over the magazines, albeit they had those black bars pasted everywhere to cover up the naughty bits. For those of you who ogled these pictorials (while pretending to be offended in front of conservative wrestling fans who thought these trashy photos degraded the wrestling industry!)but were frustrated that the forbidden fruit was blocked from your view, well... the women are here in all their Amazonian glory! This trip down memory lane is also enjoyable as this was before the era where virtually every erotica model had the extensive plastic surgeries so prevalent today. An interesting sidenote for fans of adult cinema, one of themodels who frequent the pages of \\"Exquisite Mayhem\\" is the legendary Seka!<br />If you are a nostalgic wrestling fan who is indifferent or \\"on the fence\\" about the erotic nature of this book, the ratio between pro wrestling and apartment wrestling pics is pretty evenly divided. The book is well worth the price. This is easily the best pro wrestling collectible I have found in over five years.	2002-01-24

Books	5	22	22	N	N	Essential reading for fans of pro wrestling's history.	We can go back and forth, argue and banter over the question &quot;When was pro wrestling's golden age?&quot; without coming to a consensus. One thing is certain: the golden age of pro wrestling literature is here and now. &quot;Hooker&quot; ranks on the top of the wrestling publication mountain, right alongside the autobiographies of Mick Foley and Dynamite Kid. What makes Lou Thesz's biography stand apart is his firsthand account of the pro wrestling industry during an era that has too little authentic historical coverage. Mr. Thesz gives us something that I doubt many others from that period (1930s onward) could: he eloquently tells of his fascinating journey as a wrestler, and gives the story greater depth since he tells us about the nature of pro wrestling as an industry. We get a bird's eye view of the cyclical rise and fall of several powerful wrestling promotions, the specifics of promotional wars, and the bartering between promoters. We see the profession through the eyes of a man who had to work simultaneously as the World's Heavyweight champion and a savvy man of business. <br />If there is any weakness in this book, Mr. Thesz is upfront about it. He makes no pretenses that it is difficult to write a first hand account of promoters and fellow wrestlers objectively; no matter how hard one tries, prejudices and biases will show. Taking this into account, I have even greater admiration for the end result. He pulls no punches criticizing men he considered limited technical wrestlers (IE Antonino Rocca Baron Leone), yet he carefully points out their strengths as performers, and sounds genuinely sympathetic when such performers were exploited by greedy promoters.<br />We read detailed accounts of Thesz's experiences with wrestling legends like Joe Stecher, Ad Santel, George Tragos, and Dara Singh. We learn about his lifelong friendship with mentor Ed &quot;Strangler&quot; Lewis; how if it weren't for one phone call Lewis made, the name Lou Thesz could have beenabsent from wrestling history. <br /> I am especially jazzed that Mr. Thesz wrote a detailed account of &quot;The Iowa Cornstalk,&quot; Fred Grubmier, the wrestler who deceived people into thinking he was the village idiot, when in fact he was quite the sharp shooter! I have heard stories about Fred Grubmier before, and am glad Mr. Thesz chose to include him in this book. It would be a crime to let Fred Grubmier's name fade from wrestling history.<br />Whether you are a fan of wrestling past or present, this book will give you a vivid picture of pro wrestling as an industry. If you are somebody who has aspirations to enter the pro wrestling business, I strongly urge you to read this book along with Foley's and Dynamite's; these works will give you fair warning before diving into a career that requires a clever sense of business, talent, and as Lou Thesz says in the beginning of the book, perhaps something in the way of a guardian angel!	2001-04-18

If you enjoy action packed color photos but hate to read, maybe this book is for you! The text in this book has little depth; all we read is the various plots and characters in the now defunct version of WCW. WCW storylines came off badly enough on TV over the past few years, and they translate just as bad on paper.There are so many books on pro wrestling today that offer fascinating insight into the pro wrestling biz, but this is not one of them. If you want a flashy coffee table book strictly for the sake of photos, then this book serves it purpose. It seems odd that this is categorized as a &quot;childrens' book.&quot; Even taking that it might be geared towards children into consideration, the writing comes off as superficial. There was a day when it was accepted that most books on pro wrestling portray the wrestlers as the characters they portray on TV, never &quot;exposing&quot; the true nature of the business. Those days are over, which makes this book sadly behind the times.	2001-04-12

This book may not have made a splash on the bestseller's list, which is a loss to millions of potential readers. &quot;Pure Dynamite&quot; is told through the eyes of Tommy Billington, &quot;The Dynamite Kid,&quot; and he tells the story of his wrestling career in such candid detail. It's a candid account that most people would hesitate to tell; unlike many people who publish their own bios, Dynamite Kid does not try to paint himself as a humanitarian, nor does he try to tell us his comrades were supreme and selfless individuals. I think much credit should also be given to co-author Alison Coleman, who could have wrote the book in &quot;proper textbook English, eliminating the abundant slang,&quot; but instead keeps this book rich with character by using the slang; as I read the book, I could picture the work being spoken in that distinct English dialect! This book paints a vivid picture of the daily grind professional wrestlers go through, the friendships and jealousies that grow, and the toll living on the road can take over the course of just a few years. Highly recommended for anybody who loves the wrestling business, or even for the newfound fan who wants to learn about the wrestling business.	2001-04-05

I've enjoyed all of Banana Yoshimoto's books, my favorite being the short story collection &quot;Lizard.&quot; What I loved about this book of three novellas is that we have three entirely different tales with identical elements: sleep lending itself as a catalyst or barrier in the womens' lives; and each grieving over the untimely death of somebody who touched their lives. What struck me most -even above the theme of sleep- is the varying impact that those who passed away have had on the people they left behind. In &quot;Night and Night's Travelers,&quot; the see the loss of Yoshihiro through his sister's eyes, yet the story shows how his short life had a rich impact on two other key characters. &quot;Love Songs&quot; takes an interesting twist when a young woman learns that a woman who was her nemesis (they battled over a selfish lover) has died, and works to make peace the departed. The third tale &quot;Asleep,&quot; gives us a narcoleptic young woman who copes with a close friend's suicide, and simultaneously deals with the fact that her lover's wife lay dormant in a coma. To tell much more of the plot would be giving away enough the wreck the enjoyment of these stories. Ms. Yoshimoto uses the hint of apparitions to paint a moving portrait of three women who must cope with these losses too soon in their lives. I am a complete mark for Banana Yoshimoto's work, I praise the page she writes on! That said, I would still recommend this book to someone who is unfamiliar with her work.	2001-04-05

While the film &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; merely displayed Andy Kaufman's offbeat brand of humor and unusual behavior, Bob Zmuda goes further and deeper by telling us why Andy felt motivated to entertain and/or baffle his audience. The big money film production gave us a one-dimensional view of Andy Kaufman. I highly recommend you shell out your money for this book instead; the biography is much more fascinating than the film. The story of Kaufman and Zmuda's friendship is moving, and very well told. Zmuda avoids putting his pal on a pedestal; he describes Kaufman's creative strengths, but also explores his susceptibility in believing many &quot;new age&quot; theories. This book is a great biography, even if you're not a fan of Andy Kaufman.	2001-03-23

Kerouac's work begins as mere scribble, but arises into its own typewritten form of Derwellian musings, none of which can be found easily. Just as late film director Ren Cardonas could present an existential presence in clear yet infantile scenery, Kerouac brilliantly describes the impermanance of romantic endeavors, be they emersed in splendour, despair, or paraisic longing. Spanish literary critic Jos Fernandez once suggested that if we read the initial passages out loud, we can feel the nightmarish Guajardian tone that Jack Kerouac intended to convey; he speaks the truth, for this is one literary landmark that reveals itself with greater clarity when performed as spoken word.  The undertow suggested in the form of the young hipster woman brings an oddly misunderstood romantic optimism; it's as if &quot;Pierroth le Fou&quot; and Popitekus combined their own stories to create this Beat masterpiece. This is essential reading for the admirer of the Beat Generation.	2001-03-22

I bought &quot;Lizard&quot; immediately after I finished NP, resisting the temptation to set high hopes that my second look at Yoshimoto's work would cast the same spell at me. To my surprise, &quot;Lizard&quot; has become one of my favorite short story compilations. I find myself reading many of the tales repeatedly; the last time a short story collection gave me a similar buzz was nearly twenty years ago, when I discovered JD Salinger's &quot;Nine Stories.&quot;     What strikes me most about Banana Yoshimoto is her empathic voice when she writes from a male viewpoint in the first person. When I read these tales, I feel like Ms. Yoshimoto tries to understand what goes through the minds and emotions of contemporary men. The only other female author who rings my bell (so far) in this respect is Willa Cather. I believe it's a tricky balancing act to write from the perspective of the opposite sex and have it ring true.    All stories in this book are vivid and thoughtful, but the title story is the strongest of all. A young man shows us both the gentle strength and fragile secrets inside the girlfriend he nicknames &quot;Lizard.&quot; In the same beat he shows us his strength and vulnerability, yet never loses focus on Lizard.    I have become a great admirer of Banana Yoshimoto over the past three years. This collection is a great introduction for any reader who wants to give her work a read.	2001-03-21

A few are great, many are so-so, and some are disappointing. I hate to say this book is one of the disappointments; I love the idea of a pro wrestling &quot;book of lists,&quot; I've even known enthusiasts who have considered trying out the idea. &quot;Wrestling's Most Wanted&quot; delivers list after list of stage names, family combos, gimmicks... the categories themselves are interesting, but the examples give little interesting information other than citing who used what gimmick, who uses which finishing hold, etc... I doubt the author really knows a lot about pro wrestling; it seems like he merely collected a book's worth of information and tossed them into a book. Maybe those who know nothing about the pro wrestling biz might enjoy some of the newfound information in these lists; if so, kudos to the author for turning newbies into possible fans. If you are, on the other hand, a wrestling fan who is only even ankle deep in your pro wrestling studies and initiation, you are much better off purchasing the autobiographies of Lou Thesz, Mick Foley and Dynamite Kid.	2001-03-19
