This enchanting classic is as lively and moving to read as the day it was written. There is no Victorian stodginess or moralizing here. I remember reading an essay where Simone Weil lamented over the difficulty of portraying goodness in literature--in fiction evil seemed to dominate. Well here in the character of the lad Diamond is one of the most convincing evocations of human goodness and saintliness in literature, childrens' or adult. One is reminded of St. Francis of Assisi when contemplating Diamond; his purity, innocense, and unselfconsciousness float right off the page. I especilly call your attention to the dialogue between Diamond and his mother on the beach as she tries hopelessly to explain to him that now they are poor. His sublimely worldly (and yet otherworldly )responses are both hilarious and deeply moving. One of MacDonald's core beliefs, so often and passionately stated throughout his writings, is here given flesh and blood: goodness is truth.	2001-09-07

Fans of this series have been stumped by this book's continuing unavailability and the unfulfilled publisher's promises to put out a paperback copy. Well I finally found this book at the local library in the LARGE PRINT fiction section. It is published by G.K.Hall who also have published the eighth in the series, Jester's Fortune in a large print addition. So check it out at your local library or ask them to order it. It is every bit as good as the others in the series so it is not on account of quality that it has been mysteriously made unavailable. If only the author would stop confusing sex with acrobatics!	2001-06-27

This is a tome which occassionally tells you just a little more than you really want to know about the three great voyages to the Pacific, but anyone seriously interested in the western penetration into the Pacific will want to read this book. It is also an articulate and formidable defense of Cook's character, seamanship, and wisdom. While Cook is not quite so venerable now in a time of great sensitivity to the depradations western invasion inflicted on indiginous people, this book presents us with an undoubtedly great man interested not in conquest but in geography, exploration, discovery, science, anthropology and peaceful relations between cultures. The aftermath was a tragedy,  (see Alan Moorehead's The Fatal Impact) but Cook was simply too high-minded and short-sighted to forsee what would come after. Cook was for better and worse a man of his time--and it was an age of enlightenment--an exemplar of the period of science, exploration and adventure. He was of course a cold fish and hard to cosy to, but there is much to admire in this brilliant portrait of the man and his age.	2001-05-16

Psychological insight combined with compelling storytelling make this account of the most famous mutiny in history thrilling reading 30 years after its original publication. The whole story is here in a brisk 300 pages that one regrets to have finished. Scrupulously fair to all concerned, more interested in exploring the causes of this tragedy than in assessing blame, with keen psychological discernment in limning the characters of Bligh (a truly Jeckyl and Hyde phenomenom) and Christian (beautiful, charming and weak), with a final last chapter hypothesis that is as stunning as it is plausible; but as the author admits, the reasons for this strange mutiny are ultimately unprovable. All the great mysteries, like the Kennedy assassination and the Bounty mutiny, are in the end unsolvable and that is what makes them so compelling. Thirty years on this vivid and acute examination of a certain unpleasantness in the south Pacific in 1789 must be judged a classic. I finished it with goosebumps on my flesh.	2001-05-16

It is not so much succint or econmonical as distilled. In the age of the thousand page biography, Carpenter accomplishes a perceptive and compassionate potrait in a brisk 300 pages. There is  a particularly thrilling moment recounted, when Tolkien, the soulmates of his youth struck down in the Great War, commits to carry the flame for them, and sets himself no less a task the the construction of a new mythology for his time and people. The long and arduous trek from there to the embarkation for the Grey Havens is movingly told by a biographer worthy of his subject. This biography shall live as long as Frodo continues to wend his way through the imaginations of those who suspect that myth is the road to truth.	2001-04-21

This book while not compelling or a must read, is still a well written if standard introduction to the the story of the conquest of the Alps by (mostly) British climbers from the Alpine Club. While it is neither as authoritative nor comprehensive (nor thankfully as long) as Walt Unsworth's &quot;Everest&quot; it is nonetheless a fine introduction that engagingly lays out both the plot and characters in the story of man vs the Alps. From his blbliography and introduction, you can pick up the story in more detail where you please. His treatment of Whymper is first-rate; indeed he is more indulgent and less sardonic with these heroes than he was of John Barrow and his &quot;boys.&quot;Mr. Fleming, in addition to laying out the facts, is always shrewd in his analysis of motive and character.  Again, while this is no classic, it is a professional job by an intelligent writer on a fascinating subject intended for the general reader. I was appreciative.	2001-01-20

Utterly delightful and whimsical but as always with the strange Mr. D totally unsentimental, this story sweeps you along with a wonderful melange of eccentric characters and his unfailing narrative pulse  until suddenly and marvelously you find yourself perched atop the Empire State Building in an inspired ending to this wondrous adventure. I devoured this book smiling all the way through.

This is a brief, very brisk rehearsal of Scott's fateful (and fatal) trek to the South Pole and partway back. If you are interested in this story and pressed for time this book concisely sets out the facts. It is well written and well organized; it is,however,also controversial because it attempts to refurbish Scott's reputation from the drubbing administered by Roland Huntford in &quot;The Last Place on Earth.&quot; It is a nice try but it won't wash. Huntford's tome sits atop the tomb of Scott's reputation and is not budged by the light breeze of this sympathetic potrayal. The verdict must stand: Preston kind but false, Huntford mean but true.	2000-12-29

That is the theme of this gripping recreation/analysis of the great Scott/Amundson race to the South Pole. For decades Scott's fatal trek bestowed a posthumous immortality on him, while Amundson became a footnote, even though he was the winner. This book corrects this historical misjudgment. Basically Huntford states that Scott deserved to die--this is not his personal verdict but the verdict that the Pole itself cast upon Scott. He was poorly organized, his plans were vague,he was rigid in his views--he learned nothing from his first visit nor from the memoirs of those who also had made the visit, he was a poor leader of men and highly self-defensive. While Amundsen planned his campaign like Hitchcock made one of his movies: the whole thing was fully conceptualized in his mind down to the smallest detail before the first frame was taken; the journey itself was simply the materialization of the mind's idea. It is hard to feel much sympathy for Scott, and the author perhaps lets his disgust at his incompetence and the waste of life it caused color his presentation, but so well argued is this book that Scott is unlikely to rise again from the ashes Huntford has made of his reputation. This book is a classic, resurrecting one reputation and burying another, full of shrewd insights on men, leadership, climate and struggle. And it is a gripping, compelling page-turner to boot.	2000-12-28

This is two parts action/adventure to one part historical fiction, but the action is so breathless, constant and unrelenting on shore and sea, you don't really care but just go along for a ride both wild and fun. There are more hairbreath escapes, crashes, and other sudden if improbable plot twists than a Dukes of Hazard rerun. This is intelligent escapist literature. The comparison should not be to the unique O'Brian, but to Richard Woodman's nautical series(and how both authors love to potray that great stereotype, the naval sadist). This one was indeed better than the first and I look forward to cracking open the next three (so far) adventures of Biddlecomb and Rumstick. And more of Fitzgerald, please! Keep scribbling Mr. Nelson, I'm having as much fun as you are.	2000-12-04

Ages 9 and up the cover informs which at age 50 allows me in on one of the most beautiful reading experiences of a lifetime. It is romantic in the best sense of the word: one thinks of Blake's &quot;to see a world in a grain of sand,&quot; or in this case in a secret garden. For this is a romance of two odd, solitary children who fall in love--not with each other--but with the world. To grow from isolation to friendship, from solitude to joy, from loathing   of self to delight in nature, the themes are standard but deeply felt and movingly evoked in simple but lovely prose.      The world is beautiful, once wrote Thomas Merton, to remind us we were originally meant for paradise. The Secret Garden is another such reminder. &quot;I'm going to live forever and ever and ever,&quot; Colin famously exults and in this great book for children and adults he does and he does and he does.	2000-11-23

I take it that the &quot;wretched stone&quot; is a metaphor for television and its hypnotic effect. I am taking a course on children's literature and have been sampling picture books, and so far Van Allsburg wins the palm. The darkness of this tale may be disconcerting to some of the young set, but the last page with its bright red, white and yellow colors and its kicker wit dispels the gloom and sends us all to bed happier and the wiser.	2000-09-23

This book is as much a memoir of a particularly confusing time in the  author's life as well as a meditation on travel writing, particularly his  bete noire, Bruce Chatwin, as it is a sea adventure. Truth be told, the  author is more intelligent than likeable but it is because of the  intelligence that he manages to bring all the disparate elements and themes  of the book into a satisfying whole. If it is primarily a good sea yarn you  are looking for, this is probably not where you want to go, but if the more  philosophical side of travel writing appeals to you I would recommend this  book highly. His musings on Chatwin are especially intriguing. As a bonus  the ending is harrowing and cathartic, leading to his concluding theme  (that will amuse all us armchair travel readers): Stay Home--the water is  only in between where you really live your life.	2000-09-02

If you love Jefferson, biography, American history, good writing in fat  books and if you have world enough and time, this monumental six volume  biography is calling you. Jefferson has taken his knocks recently and  deservedly so, but while this is stronly sympathetic to the sage, it is not  uncritical nor a whitewash. While Jefferson has earned his detractors, he  deserves his admirers too, and in Malone he has found a worthy and eloquent  celebrant of his genius. John Adams was right: Jefferson still lives and  nowhere as happily as in this biography.	2000-08-21

Forester	If you like nautical fiction of the great age of sail (e.g. Forester, O'Brian, Woodman, Marryat), you will enjoy this opening volume of the  action-packed, fast moving and realistic adventures of our tarnished hero,  Alan Lewrie. While on water, this book is as good as any of the above  writers, excepting of course the incomparable O'Brian. However, our author  founders on land with trashy sex scenes more appropriate to a Harld Robbins  potboiler. The author trying to model his protagonist on  Fraser's  Flashman, or Fielding's Tom Jones comes badly ascupper. These humorless sex  scenes are perhaps why this nautical series is not as popular as many  others. However, once back on the high seas, this book  recaptures its pace  and becomes highly exciting and enjoyable. One day, however, I hope to open  a book with a handsome, brave, cunning and feisty hero in possession of a  small penis. It will, however, not be written by the otherwise entertaining  Mr. Lambdin.	2000-08-18

This series of nautical adventures during the Napoleonic era will do just fine, thanks. What it lacks in eloquence  and sophistication it more than makes up for in  unremitting action,  adventure and derring-do. Woodman is especially good on the political  backround to the melodrama, without letting it bog the story down. There  will never be another O'Brien, let's face it, but these books will divert  and amuse until enough time has passed to warrant a re-reading of the O'B  canon. The heroes are noble, the villains wonderfully evil,and the plot has  just the right amount of improbable coincidences to remind one that this is  entertainment and not literature. I devoured it in two days. The first  three novels (and do read this series in order of publication) are now  available from amazon.uk in one volume. Enjoy!	2000-08-15

Well-written, comprehensive, shrewd in it appraisals, concise in its descriptions of the manifold climbs, and not afraid to treat the politics, squabbles and jealousies that surrounded so many of the events described.  The last few chapters do become monotonous, offering too much of a good  things, but the book is superb on the important climbs and climbers:  Mallory, Irvine, Hillary, Shipton, Messner, and even outsiders like Maurice  Wilson are brought vividly to life. This book will stand as the standard  treatment of the pursuit of the Everest Summit. The snowboarders,  paragliders and skiers as well as the commercial expeditions have  vulgarized it all, but this book brings us back to a time when the sacred  and mysterious mountain stood in aloof resistance to a heroic band of  special men.	2000-07-25

This book not only answers these questions  but does so elegantly and concisely. Yes the illustrations are attractive,  but the narrative can stand on its merits alone.

While this book is probably targeted to the college history major just embarking on the study of Thucydides' classic, it serves equally well for that dying breed, the general reader looking for serious but lively narrative history. The introduction, notes, backround information, and maps  are all helpful in getting one over one's trepidation in the face of such a  daunltess classic. The book is handsomely presented, the print size is  thankfully generous (no squinting) and Thucydides is just as profound and  eloquent as he was 24 centuries ago. I too hope with a previous reviewer  that he is now working on Herodotus.	2000-05-22

Well no, I haen't read them all, but I've read a lot of them, and only Robert Graves comes close. This book does what historical fiction is supposed to do and seldom does: evoke a time and place that is not our time  and our place. So much of historical fiction is a but a Potemkin village;  contemporary characters and attitudes promenading before superficial  historical settings.

He interprets the first term as a  stunning success: to wit, Jefferson set about the dismantling of government  over the lives of the Republic's citizens. For one brief shining moment the  ideals of the Revolution reached their pinnacle. It was not, alas and  inevitably, destined to last. McDonald charts the decline and fall that was  Jefferson's second term. Both brilliant and unorthodox, this book is  exciting to read and confirms my belief that books that can interpret the  past only through current day perspectives are more about the present than  the past. This book is about the past and makes no apologies for it, and  takes its place among Jeffersonian books by Henry Adams, Dumas Malone, and  Joseph Ellis as a classic treatment of our classic President.	1999-10-31

You do not read this book, you  experience it; and come to a state of awe and yes, even love for this  extraordinary saint of our times.  The paradox of Weil is that in her  severe view of life, great solace is to be found--the solace of truth and  wisdom when you know, indeed, feel you have encountered it. In conclusion,  let me paraphrase the author: it is impossible to think about Simone Weil  without thinking about God. Amen.	1999-06-05
