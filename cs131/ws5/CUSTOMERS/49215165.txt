McCullough  takes you from the seige of Boston, through the defeats at Brooklyn, White Plains, and Fort Washington, on to the victorious Delaware River crossing at Trenton and Princeton in that pivotal year of 1776 in the American Revolution.  Those citizen soldiers displayed the Warrior Ethos emphasized in the Army today and still adhered to on the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq during the current Global War on Terrorism:  always put the mission first, never accept defeat, never quit, never leave a fallen comrade.  This book should be on the professional reading list of all military leaders!	2005-07-24

I \\"read\\" this excuse for a book, which was already marked down to half price tonight, in about 30 minutes.  I am glad, however, that I had a chance to see the documents myself.  I am a drilling reservist and Iraqi Freedom veteran.  I reviewed the voluminous documents of his military records that make up over half the book.  Bush served his  then 6 years statutory service obligation.  He commissioned in 1968 and resigned his commission in 1974.  I looked at his retirement points.  He had the minimum 50 points/year while actively drilling to have the year count toward retirement.  In the reserve component, you don't have to go to drill every month to have a good year.  You get 4 points/ weekend drill and 15 point for annual training.  You even get 15 points/year just for being in the guard/reserve.  You can do make up training as well, if you want to, otherwise you can request and receive an excused absence without making up the drill.  So you can miss several months/year, have up to 9 unexcused absences, and still be a satisfactory participant.  People in the guard/reserve have full-time civilian jobs that at times may conflict with drill, hence the liberal makeup/absence policy.  When he went to Harvard in 1973 he went into the inactive reserve but was still subject to involuntary recall until he resigned his commission in 1974 at the end of his service obligation.  I read his officer evaluation reports.  They were excellent!  His commission was in the Reserve of the Air Force in the Air National Guard.  When he served on active duty while federally recognized, he was in the Air Force.  He had several DD214s with honorable active duty service and was honorably discharged from the service in 1974.  He flew fighter jets as part of homeland defense during a time when we were also involved in a Cold War with the Soviet Union.  He failed to take a physical and was removed from flying status when the Air Force was downsizing from Vietnam and his jet was becoming obsolete.  It is curious the memo removing him from flight status shows another pilot from his unit also removed for not taking a physical but the name is redacted.  It would be interesting to interview that person to see why they did not take the physical as well.  Maybe they were told not to.  I just don't understand how these facts render him \\"unfit.\\"  You can't be AWOL unless you are on active duty.  He did his duty and served honorably.It is curious the memo removing him from flight status shows another pilot from his unit also removed for not taking a physical but the name is redacted.

The photos were from archives as well as participants' personal collections.  There are photos of the military in battle, the politicians prosecuting the war (especially Hitler), and ordinary citizens on the home front.  The author adds narrative background information on the war from the German perspective.  While there are several books of American wartime color photography, this is the first I have seen from the enemy point of view.

The best feature, to me, however, is the plethora of photos showing the weapons in actual use in the field.  There are also many era photos taken by several of the author's relatives who served in the war.

This book demonstrates what can and did happen when our president violated many oaths (of office, marriage, law practice, grand jury, among others) and the devastating effects it can have...people can and did DIE as a result!  LTC Patterson gives a birdseye view of the Clinton's dereliction of duty, up close and personal.

Aside from his usual description of battle with the enemy, he also makes liberal use of noncombat scenarios during his unit's advances.

With those words, lead House Manager Henry Hyde urged the U.S. Senate to convict and remove from office President William Jefferson Clinton, impeached by the U.S House of Representatives for perjury and obstruction of justice in February 1999. In this book, coming over a year after the first impeachment trial in American history of an elected U.S. President, the author reviews the heroic efforts of the 13 House Managers to do their constitutional duty and present their case against the President to the Senate for final judgment.<br />Each manager was interviewed about their personal and political careers prior to impeachment and how that influenced their approach to it. Then the author followed with what role each manager played in the impeachment inquiry in the House Judiciary Committee as well as before the full House, quoting liberally from their statements in the Congressional Record. Each manager then reflected on their participation in this historic event and its effect on the current and future political scene of our country and the rule of law.<br />All in all, the book flowed nicely, sprinkled with quotes from Clinton supporters as well. I highly recommend this book to those interested in the Clinton impeachment from the personal perspective of those who were most familiar with the evidence and prosecuted what some have referred to as the trial of the 20th century.	2001-09-09

The author outlines the formation of elite Marine commando units and the intra-service squabbling it entailed.  He then takes you into the early career of the leader, Evans Carlson, and its influence on his philosophy of covert operations such as these units were tasked with.  He later follows with a descriptive narrative of the preparation, training, and execution of the mission of invading Butaritari Island in Makin Atoll in the Gilbert Islands. I applaud his use of oral interviews of survivors of the operation.  My only critique was the ineffective sprinkling of humorous events throughout which did not blend well with the flow of the story.  Overall I highly recommend this book to those interested in learning more about one of the elite Marine units of WWII.	2001-08-23

It is one of the best accounts I have read about the USMC in WWII.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in an overview which portrays the Marines' sacrifices during their brutal island hopping strategy which was instrumental in America's ultimate victory over Japan ending WWII.	2001-04-03

Most of the major campaigns are covered.  If there is any major drawback to this book, it is that there are only 2 or 3 pages of color photos, which might limit its usefulness to re-enactors or militaria collectors.  Its main strength is the photo documentation of the Marines' island hopping efforts in the Pacific.  It is recommended to anyone interested in a visual history of the combat record of the US Marines in WWII.	2001-02-17

He addresses the various variations seen, with specifics related to years and serial number ranges.  His writing style is conversational as opposed to narrative.  The graphics are adequate although color would've been more useful.  For those looking for operator manual type information, this is not the book for you.  If you are interested in collecting the 10/22, this is a good place to start.	2001-01-08
