Not only was I a fan of mysteries, I loved and still do the light touch of Miss Christie, her lovable characters from Hercule Poirot to Miss Marple.  It is therefore a great, great compliment when I say that M.M. Kaye is better than Christie.  Why?  She is more detailed, there is greater local color, the characters are better developed.  I am thrilled to have found someone as wonderful as M.M. Kaye - this is the first novel I read of hers-- and cannot wait to read more.  I recommend this book to all mystery lovers, to all Agatha Christie lovers.  Flying colors!	2005-07-03
US	42224601	R2K9IMMHYRFOAH	0452282977	155843737	Miss Garnet's Angel	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Discovering soul	This is an enchanting novel.  Slow paced, it reveals more than describes the spiritual peregrination of an aging woman, retired, and alone, who seeks comfort and meaning for life while travelling to assuage the loss of a life-long friend.  Schoolmarmish and void of an interesting personality, Julia Garnet's paced awareness of her being both physical and spiritual is the making of the novel. What touches her at first is art. Then, it is story of Tobias and the angel, of which she learns in passing and which she pursues doggedly to the end of her days. The weight of centuries, so evident in Venice, and the seduction of paintings and architecture help in her path to self knowledge, for they add a sense of continuity to ways of thinking and believing which Julia had not been aware of.  Her stay in Venice changes her, and her spritual growth touches the reader.  This is a must read novel not only for those who like good writing, but principally for those who believe in the power of art as a means of redeeming one's soul.  Five stars, without a question.	2005-04-22

Once again Qiu Xiaolong offers a fantastic mystery.  What amazed me in his first novel was the cultural depth, so to speak, the feeling I had at the end of the novel that I had learned more about modern China than I would have,  had I watched a documentary or assisted a one-semester course at the local university.  I had the same sensation this time, even though some of the minor details were already known.  Inspector Chen is a very believable character caught like so many of us between a profession [police officer] and an avocation [poet] which at first appear mutually exclusive.  The true revelation comes when we discover how his knowledge of poetry helps him in his investigations.  This characteristic of his, the love of poetry, also makes Chen - at least to my eyes -- more Chinese, for crafty, more sensitive than many men and certainly than most detectives, reminescent only of Inspector Morse, in his beloved Cambridge.   <br /> <br />I agree with the previous reviewer than some of the more literary passages, tangential subjects, and cultural observations appear to have been shaved off in this second book, probably through the hands of some know-it-all editor who believes that a thick book with plenty of literary allusions might bore or be too much of a challenge to the ninth-grade level reading he imagines his readers to possess.   <br /> <br />But in the end, the cuts, if there were some, did not take away from the overall charm of the book,  of Inspector Chen and of China.     <br /> <br />I intend to read his next book and I strongly recommend the reading of this one; both for the mystery as well as for the information on a changing China.	2005-01-05

This is a very nice, different novel that is difficult to put down and in its course illustrates some of modern Japan.  There are two parallel stories going on, all centered around a young man finding his place in society.  One of the stories shows the manner in which young Japanese, reared still in a very traditional manner, adjust and adapt their lives to a Global modernity, and particularly an American-influenced world. The other story shows how despite the long shadow of WWII the Japanese are slowly coping and dealing with their past, their losses, and their own prejudices.  So our hero stands in fact at a turning point.  He and his generation by extension are the link between these two worlds.    The world of Toshi, our hero, an exceedingly creative guy, is the source for much amazement to the Western reader, from the loneliness of the mega city, to the megaphone messages in the subway.  Pets and coffee houses are also the source for much wonder.    The book deals overtly and covertly on prejudices.  Prejudices the Japanese have about Americans and those that Americans have about the Japanese.  Prejudices against homosexuals, against Koreans.   But all of it is done deftly, with amazing humor.      Alan Brown's observations on how others can perceive Americans, in Japan or out are very keen, funny and true.  But he is a master in finding quirky juxtapositions, and more than that in making all his characters three-dimensional and believable.      This is certainly a novel worth reading.  If you have a weekend coming up and would like something offbeat, occasionally hilarious, and fascinating to read, give this one a try, you will not regret it.	2004-11-26

Well, there are no dialogues, and the story drags.  The book however had many characteristics that should make me love it!  My training is that of a historian, I fancy -- in my spare time -- reading on the Middle Ages, I've been fascinated with travel writing, I've lived in North Africa and to top it off, I've done some reading on Judaism in the Iberian Penninsula. And yet this book proved to be a collection of frustrations and it appeared never to end.<br /><br />  Mr. Yehoshua chose to base his narrative in the oral tradition typical not only to the Middle Ages but also present in Jewish and North African traditions.  So the development of his story is as repetitive as those told from generation to generation, to remind each of the listeners the main characteristcs of what's being mentioned.  He does it however without the charm that a colloquial narrator would infuse.  This distant omnipresent narrator who tells us the  story instead took away any sense of drama, of importance, of eagerness, and of deeply felt conflicts.  The narrative line seemed adrift, like a boat going from port to port without a chart.<br /><br />  There was also not a single character that involved this reader emotionally.  It felt like an intellectual exercise that ended up being too boring to stand.  It was a struggle for me to finish the book and frankly, life is too short for the daily sacrifice I was inflicting on myself.	2004-11-12

It is fast paced, it is exotic in location and it has an intelligent cop.  But even more astounding it only has smart women characters.  There is not a single blond bimbo, prostitute or a lowlife female character, of dubious virtues.  ALL of the women have professions, know what they want, and SURPRISE! they think!  Not one needs the protection of our tough cop!  This is so refreshing!  It makes me want to read more of Espinosa.  The book is a standard mystery.  There is no need to try to find here the answer to your philosophical questions.  Look for other styles for that.  But it is a truly enjoyable one afternoon or two, depending on your time book,  an uncompromising weekend read!	2004-11-09

This was my second Margaret Drabble, and I liked it even more than the other one [Millstone], I would have thought this a  difficult feat, just a week ago.  But here it is, this is a great book.   <br /> <br />The story line is so simple it is ridiculously difficult to define.  Drabble just shows us the lives of three friends who meet regularly and grow into maturity, together--in their separate ways. When we meet them it is the end of the 1970s decade.  They had been friends for 25 years and know each other well.  When we leave them, five years later, just like life itself, nothing is clearly resolved in their lives, they have gained some self knowledge, but not much, they have gone on living.  No dramatic gestures or operatic drama.  Each has made changes and moved on to new realities, never however betraying her own integrity.  Liz Headland, a psychoterapist, through events she cannot control, eventually comes to understand more about about human relations than her training could have done.  Alix Bowen, naive and  politically engaged, wearer of her social conscience and responsibility on her sleeve, wises up when she realizes the dead-endedness of fighting alone for a better and just world, when the forces of the establishment have no interest in change.  And Esther Breuer, a romantic spirit, an academic and a WWII refugee, a woman who always felt herself an outsider, realizes that she built a belljar around herself through the studying of art, to the point of distancing herself from the men who engage her. <br /> <br />In the background is life of the early 1980s in England.  Riots, labor problems, murders, class stigmatization, and all the other nuances of England under Thatcher.   <br /> <br />The book is very funny, very biting and understated.  It is open ended, just as life is.  And we all feel sorry that we will not follow these friends for another 10 years, but we are reassured of their wellness, and their ability to handle the future.   <br /> <br />Thisbook is a jewel and a great portrait of a time and a generation.  FIVE STARS!!!	2004-08-02

Perhaps I should say that I like old memoirs and journals, particularly by women [and there are so few of them!] and that I also enjoy reading historical documents and about history of certain places and certain centuries.  That may be one of the biases of these lines.  I might also add I am not Jewish.<BR>   What is fascinating and intriguing is how this person,living 400 years ago, comes out alive and well, in this text.  That we understand her and her motives, her sense of humor.  We commune with her preocupations which give or take small differences are  preoccupations we have today: the raising of offspring; providing what you can to insure your child's future better than your own; guidance through religious beliefs and wisdom against false new religious leaders; the conduct of ethical and profitable business.<BR>     Glckel also reveals surprising details of everyday life. For instance, she required special permissions to travel and to stay within the borders of towns for being Jewish; she travels more frequently than I expected, despite her being a woman, despite the difficulties of lodging, depite her jewishness.  Sickness is awful anytime but here we see how absolutely dreadful it could be even for a well to do merchant family.  She also comandeers her business decisively and dynamically.  Her errors in judgment are few for anyone, in any century! And she loves her husband, and she is loved by him, even though she probably had an arranged marriage just like the ones she provided for her children.<BR>     I love this book because Glckel puts me in touch with the 17th century daily life, but more than that, she reminds me of the infinite chain that links us all; and in particular infinite connection that all women share, Jewish or not.  Glckel simply reminded me of the universality of our experiences, transcending centuries, religions and cultures.  Few books can do that.	2004-05-15

The theme itself -- a single woman's decision to have a child without a husband -- was rather in keeping with the sexual revolution brought about in the 1960s in Western Europe.  The narration is light and engaging, in keeping with the best of the traditional English social satirists from Austen to Pym. For my taste the books loses momentum  in the last quarter, but it is still a very intelligent rendition of manners and mores.	2004-02-24

Amazed at the scope, at the ease with which Pears weaves through the centuries and lets us share in this archeological experience in Southern France as if indeed we were putting the pieces together of these several layers of human occupation of a site.  I have enjoyed it so much, I am going back and starting it again. Also, his characters are very believable and at times, so closely modelled on known historical lives that this reader, an art historian by training, wished the characters and the works mentioned existed outside of the printed pages.  I am glad I read it, and will reread immediately.	2003-07-24

Netherlands	If you were ever curious to find out how people lived in the Netherlands of the 17th century, this book will be a great introduction.  Tracy Chevalier's detailed description of common folk of that time is superb!  And it did feel as if we were entering into the scenes depicted by Vermeer or his Delft colleagues Pieter de Hooch, Gerard Ter Borch, Gabriel Metsu.  Despite the narrow focus of the narrative, Chevalier was able to keep me involved with greater and greater interest to the end.   Here, the ordinary worries of a young woman, who finds herself pushed down in the rigid social scale, moving from an artesan's class to the servant class, are described with sympathy.  The tone, to Chevalier's benefit, is unjudgmental and adds to the sense of a true portrait of the era.  Definitely a great read, charming in all  aspects; a jewel, worth re-reading!	2003-05-30

I liked this book very much and I intend to read Wesley's other books. A Dubious Legacy kept my interest, my attention and was responsible for the discreet smile I presented throughout its reading.   For, indeed, the doings of three couples through several decades in mid 20th century -- the subject under scrutiny in this comedy of manners -- was portrayed with humorous detachment and unwavering perspicacity.  Ms Wesley is very good at placing her characters within the axioms of each decade's mores and develops insightful cameos of each era's preoccupations.<BR>This is a short novel, a succinct book,  developed in a fast tempo, keeping all along a mystery we hope to unveil.  The central characters look at first as banal as they can be, but  soon we realize appearances are misleading.  These six upper middle class friends in the English country side are the source of great social commentary made by an ironic and warm narrator, a painter as it were, using few incisive strokes.  The result is great fun and speedy reading, a book which I would recommend to anyone wishing to be intrigued and entertained.	2002-12-27

This speaks directly to strength in narration and artistry of Mr. Choukri, who shows us, in this first volume of his autobiography, the despair brought about by ignorance and poverty.  Our young man's apparent lack of hope for a better future is made clear from the start.  In his teens, born in Marocco, during the French domination, he struggles to find the rules and reasons for the world around him.  I say apparent lack of hope, because after the first few paragraphs we already know that he is sensitive, smart and will attempt to survive as best he can, without any help from his family or society.  In this respect, I was satisfied early on, for I sensed it would be all right to attach my emotions to this hero; that he would not betray my confidence.  Mr. Choukri's narration is also masterful in the depiction of the most despicable acts of violence both physical and moral.  He is detached. So we can also keep our safe distance.<br />I confess to having a special reason for reading this book.  Since I spent some time in the early 1980s in Oran, Algeria, I have been intrigued with the peoples of North Africa.  And this book takes place in many of the cities and towns that are familiar to me.  What surprises is to see that even though there was a good thirty years difference between the time this story took place and  the 1980s, there were vestiges that for some, things still remained.  I can only hope that there has been considerable improvement in the past 20 years.<br />This is a book that makes us think.  And even though the subject: a disenfranchised youth in the life of petty crimes in the fringe of society is not unusual in the literature of developing countries, it is important to return to these themes once in a while, getting out of our comforatble, well educated bubbles, and rethink our own contributions to world around us.<br />I am a better person for having read this book.  That's a sign of excellence.	2002-10-22

What an upbeat book!<br /> This is the romance of life's unpredictability; of life's path.  Helene Hanff the author and our heroine in this autobiography is a person we can all identify with: with a high school education, a survivor's tenacity, a bright mind and a bit of luck she turns what could have been a mediocre existence into an exciting if quietly successful life!  One could not have a more prototypical American dream. But here, it appears represented without the scrubbed clean, sanitized methods of Holywood.<br /> Her wonderfully charming narration, leads us through her struggles as a writer in New York, through the apparent lucky accident of her book \\"84, Charring Cross Road,\\" and the mesmerizing consequences that a successful book brings to her life.  It is her persona though, who is fascinating: a strong woman with few doubts about likes and dislikes, who fights doggedly for a living, with a good sense of humor, generosity towards others and an apparent humility.  What a combination!  But to top it off she is sharp, quick, loves books and what they can teach her.<br />This is a book to be read in one sitting, but only after you read \\"84 Charring Cross Road.\\"  It is fun, upbeat, a charmer and it also has an almost oldfashioned value:  it celebrates life!	2002-10-14

It is also an epistolary documentary. In the 20+ years of correspondence between a New Yorker and an English book seller an entire portait of an era is depicted. Not only the small details of daily rationings in England, or the American's employment ups and downs; but also the manners and restrained etiquette of years past. Below the surface of these formal letters, outwardly dealing with the passion for books is an underlying void of words never written but well inderstood: a platonic love affair among people who care for books. The personalities and values of the letter writers is marvelously displayed through innuendos, reticences, outright indignation, passion and despair more often than not only alluded to. It is a masterful portrait of an era, of a relationship and of the art of letter wrting!<br />HIS: Perfectly delightful, every page. It all works because of understatement, warranted by an assumed relationship through the love of books. So what doesn't get said doesn't need to be said, for people of like minds. Like lovers. Yet the two correspondents never met.	2002-09-30

The reason is simple: this was a wonderful book!  It is entertaining, charming, enlightnening.  It taught me lots about customs and manners of Botswana. It described the climate, the flora, the preoccupations of common, regular people. And it reminded me of the universality of human experiences.  All of this with a good sense of humor.  I don't remember another book in the recent past that delighted me to the extent of a perpetual smile while in the process of reading. Five stars and fireworks! <br />His--This reminded me forcibly of Tony Hillerman's gentle detective stories, in which his hero has to negotiate between local and ancient customs and the newer and more aggressive manners of the prevailing society in the US.  The formal narrative voice and the formal manner of treating persons both announce that the human creature is to be honored and revered, even if he is slightly disreputable.  The emphasis upon morality and ethics in the detective trade is refreshing for those jaded by the commercially driven culture which reveres the bottom line. The entire novel, with its apparently naive point of view about those norms taken for granted in the Northern hemisphere, seems refreshing in its innocence and its enduring wisdom.  I loved it!	2002-09-30

It was a very nice way to solidify my very scant knowledge of the country. As a history lesson, this book excels, for it makes interesting and lively what could be perceived as dry historical information. The family saga -- three generations -- is perfectly suitable for such an endeavor.<br /> However, the book portrays three different lives [more with the subplots], and as such, it lacks smooth continuity, for as soon as we begin to understand, and identify with a character, a death occurs, and it is time to move on to the next point of interest, or character. The only continuous link is Chevathar, the home place.<br /> The sense of place, the depiction of life, the taste and colors of India are indeed portrayed well and they seduce. But for the emotional stacatto we readers have to play, because of differing main characters, I have taken one star away from Mr. Davidar's very good book.	2002-09-09

I have been a small business owner for the past fifteen years, and part of my success has been the consequence of regular reading and regular application as I judge possible of what I read about marketing.  This book though is different, it is not quite a business-how-to book, it is a collection of essays that have made me think about my business from a different perspective  and they have also helped me explain to myself, why after carrying one particular item in my store, all of a sudden, several months down the road, without any particular special effort,  that item would fall into the category of one of our most popular sales...<br />If you are looking for howtos or ways to market your business, or your manufactured goods, this is not your best bet.  For that I would recommend any of Levinson's Guerrila Marketing books.  But if you have either passed that phase or if you enjoy thinking about social forces, this is a book for you.  It is clever, it has momentum and gives the reader wings for the imagination.  Any book that can do this is worth its price in gold and certainly worth 5 stars.	2002-09-05

Japan with refined precision and delicious details. Add that to the sensitive profile of the writer of the world's first novel, a woman nonetheless, and you have the makings of a terrific story.  This piece of historical fiction is filled with informative data about Japanese culture in the Heian period, about Japanese traditions in poetry, about Chinese influences in Japanese culture and daily customs, tasks and foods of the era.  All done with a sensitive precision of language and an engaging story line.<br />    Ms. Dalby kept herself as close as possible to the facts known about the author of The Tale of Genji.  In doing so, she may have compromised the development of her plot and characters surrounding Lady Murasaki.

Since then I have tried to enlarge that experience by travelling through the area and reading about the different cultures living in North Africa.  How I wish that in 1984 I had already read Elizabeth Fernea's account of her year in Marrakech!  Marocco and Marrakech are obviously different cultures from that of Algeria, but the detailed descriptions Fernea gives us about feasts, customs and manners, so very sensitively rendered would have helped and would also have alerted me to the minefield of possible \\"faux pas\\" -- which in retrospect I committed by the dozens!<BR>     From my experience this is a very credible account of life in the region.  And most important -- it is not patronizing.  Marrakech life is presented with humor, with that perplexing foreignness that is typical to Westerners in North Africa, and with respect for religious differences.  <BR>      The book reads very well, it is full of curious data and also of excitment.

If you enjoy the works of Barbara Pym, Bernice Rubens,  Penelope Lively among others, Muriel Spark is also for you.  In addition this book permits an interesting reminescense of life in London in the years immediately after WWII, without the traps of emotional nostalgia.

The pace of narration gives the reader a chance to be curious about the murder, to perceive contemporary China from within and to brush up lightly on Chinese poetry.  It is a delight, and like good wine to be tasted slowly, steadily and to the last drop.   Chen is the perfect detective-hero: young, intelligent, learned and a little rebellious, smooth but a reluctant hero.  His rendition is masterful, so we feel we understand him and learn to care like he does for China and Chinese literature.  We also care for his tender heart and for his loneliness.  Through the Red Heroin we learn about China's recent past and about the fast pace of change in the country.  And we also learn what it is about Western culture that the Chinese, and others want to reject.  We can only agree with them.  This is of course more than a murder mystery,  it is an attempt to explain a moment in China and it is very successful.  A must read. <BR>HIS: This is a well-written mystery, which might deservedly win the Edgar, for which it was nominated; but I don't know the competition.  I enjoyed the book immensely.  The manner of introducing relevant Chinese history was clever.  While it was a narrator's function, it occurred only during an excursus on a character--that is, it was introduced to amplify and explain characters.  Qiu is a very talented writer.  The political forces at work in the contemporary scene in China is represented with such depth and clarity that we cannot but assume the writer is living the scene in the moment.  The beauty of the narrative is that the humanity of the characters as well as the politicians (and their machinations) is made perfectly clear.  They are in other words brought within the realm of the familiar.  They finally are not foreign or different.  We have our problems, they have theirs; this mystery evolvesamid their problems and stuggles with those.  I would recommend the book strongly to any reader, whether a lover of mystery novel or not.	2002-05-30

If it is outdated, as some have mentioned, it did not appear to be overly outdated to me, who as a Westerner lived in Islamic North Africa in the mid 1980 and have since been interested on the subject. <br />Ms. Goodwin is objective, cares to describe what we in the West would value and what the women within the Islamic community also value. There are great differences bewteen all these countries and they are shown in good faith and broad lines. <br />A great serious read for those trying to reach outside of the Western world.	2002-05-10
US	42224601	R3SJUW93CE5GG0	0942996240	900228967	A Beggar at Damascus Gate	Books	4	7	9	N	Y	Two readers, two views, both liked the book!	HERS:  This is a haunting love story.  Doomed and powerful, full of intrigue and turns like the meandering alleys of ancient medinas.  The story works its spell with a very poetic, dreamlike, narration which echoes ancient poetry or musical rondos working time and again on similar subjects revealing at each turn a new possibility.  And even though we believe from the start that we know how it will all end we are  surprised yet again.  The heroine, Rayya, is the kind of woman I wish I had had as a heroine while a young adult.  But the book is more than this love story,  it is a manifesto.  And we are the better for gaining an important perspective on Palestine and the Palestinian quest.<BR>HIS:  This is a Romance that verges on the Novel, even wants to become a novel at the end, in order to have more impact than that conveyed by Romance.  By its very nature, Romance is dreamlike and speaks to the dreamer in us; this novel does that well, for none of the events is rooted in real time and even the love between Alex and Rayya lacks any specificity, except that it endures seven years despite numerous separations.  But the intrusive themes of Palestinian reality break in upon the dream of the lovers to break up the love story and to dump the reader into quotidian life, which is what Novels are designed to depict.  The narrator's search for Rayya becomes a novel of intrigue, almost a spy novel, in contrast with the bulk of the story.  Nevertheless, it was a rewarding experience.  I think a better editor would have demanded clearer delineations--through choice of different fonts--between the lovers' journals and the narration.  Many poetic passages in the journals move the reader deeply.  Others simply leave the reader with a vague idea of what is happening between the lovers and frustrate the reader's desire for striking scenes which would account for the almost fatalistic attraction between these two.  By the end the yearning of Rayya for a Palestinian homeland gets mixedup with her love story in such a way that we are left seeing her as Palestine.  This is not as well worked out as the author wishes.  Her last paragraph leaves us to think of Rayya as a allegorical figure, but it does not come as a fulfillment of the story's action.  It seems tacked on.	2002-05-09

I just didn't think she had the obligation of demonstrating this research in such a \\"mannerist\\" way, with quotations at the begining of each chapter from the most common books available at that time.  The intention: to  show in each chapter the illustration of a proverb, parallelling the books of proverbs she amply studied.<br />But books of proverbs have no good continuity and this is indeed what this novel lacks.  Each small chapter was intentionally composed as genre scenes like the thousands of paintings depicting the era.  The attempt to approximate the text as if we were looking at a painting makes the scene distant from the reader, which in effect is the opposite of what genre painting aspired to do.  The \\"torrid affair\\" mentioned by most other readers is neither too torrid nor gratuitous.  What appeared to me superfluous and not well explored was the futures market of the tulip world and why it was happening.  Since she chose this title, greater attention should have been placed on this historical phenomenon.<br />Overall a weak novel with some interest mostly toward the end.	2002-05-09
US	42224601	R2EOB04YNU1LGE	0060977493	521720988	The God of Small Things	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	Extraordinary Achievement, no Small Thing at all	This book powerfully recalls the astonishing feat Faulkner performed in rendering children's points of view as they try to comprehend and assimilate the tragedies drawn and suffered by the significant adults in their lives. With an equally experimental and more poetical narration than Faulkner, Arundhati Roy renders a family saga comprehending three generations in Kerala. The book should be read aloud; it needs to be heard. The brooding sense of looming disaster made me put the book aside several times, for I could not bring myself to see the disaster which would fracture the worlds of the two-egg twins. But the charm of the twins and of the narration, the eccentricities of the characters, brought me back each time to the charms of the book. Like all great poetry this needs to be read aloud and read several times. It is like a traditional Romance--as opposed to the novel which aims to do realism--which is more dreamlike and poetic than an ordinary novel It should be categorized along side _Moby-Dick_ and _One Hundred Years of Solitude_ and _Sound and Fury_.	2002-04-14

Throughout its pages, Ms. Wearing lifts the veil hiding Iranian  country life from us; she shows some of the habits in the mosques, conversations with religious people and attitudes of Westerners living there.  <BR>      It may not be the best way to learn about Iran, but it is certainly an interesting way to expand our knowledge of the people and of the culture.	2002-04-02

Mr. Barley's understated tone is a powerful tool in the rendition of amazement and humor.  Those of us who have had the pleasure of an African sojourn can relate to his continuous sense of wonder and surprise which rightfully and at every turn challenge our daily assumptions.  This is a very humorous often hilarious book, whose last chapter, Mr. Barley's return to England, is a must read for anyone trying to understand the fascination foreign travel and foreign experiences can exert.  The clash of cultures on the reverse is as powerful a discovery as his entire life in the bush was.  A great book on all accounts!	2002-03-22
US	42224601	RKX5UZFCR2DFF	0060977493	521720988	The God of Small Things	Books	5	7	7	N	Y	An extraordinary novel	Once, every now and then, I read a book that feels so powerful that I wonder how could I have lived before -- without knowing this story -- and not be aware of the void within?  The God of Small Things is one such book.  Extraordinary language carried me through.  A masterful narration permitted horrible events to unfold in such a way that I was eager to see them through.   What makes this novel great, greater than most,  is that it is not only a story about India in the 1960s, about her caste system, or about Western colonialism.  This story is about us, human beings with  follies, and many cruelties.  And it is also about our love, our need for love that more often than not is out of synchrony with our lives.  It shows us the difference between a world seen through children's eyes and that of adults.  How we corrupt ourselves as we grow into maturity, although sometimes it happens as abruptly as in the twin's lives in Ms. Roy's novel.<br />I can't add anything else here that more than 400 reviewers have not said; I would have to dissect this book, and I don't feel  comfortable doing it because I don't want to break its spell.   <BR>Suffice it to say, it is an extraordinary novel.	2002-02-22

But there is little of how it felt to grow up in Marocco 50 years ago;   and even less description of what the country or the country side was like or looked like.  <BR>    What this book has in abundance, and it is quite impressive in this respect, is an attempt to transcribe conversations; it shows quite a lot of story-telling in its most intimate manner -- among family members.  This repeated story-telling from three different generations reveals how villagers evolve and perpetuate biases or points of view that are then repeated from generation to generation. <BR>     But what this book lacks is clarity.  I wonder if this was not a problem of translation from the Arabic. The oral stories are told often without a prior reference for the pronouns \\"her, she, him , or he,\\" making it difficult to understand.  Not once, not twice, but many, many times I had to read over and reread again the same story looking for a reference and more often than not ending up, just going on without having a grip on who said what about exactly whom.  And it is my belief that, every time a careful reader has to stop and go back to read again and still be left in a state of uncertainty, something is wrong with that text.  Because I believe that Ms. Abouzeid is a good writer, I have to blame the translator -- which in this case is unfortunately, Ms. Abouzeid herself.  Three stars -- Two taken out for reading difficulty.	2002-02-08
US	42224601	R3TZWUPRLKRGGH	1903070015	943033432	Desert Governess: an Englishwoman's personal experience with the Saudi royal family	Books	3	15	15	N	Y	It all depends on your expectations	Your expectations will determine whether you like this book or not.  If you would like to know  how an average middle class English woman reacts to a life as governess of princes in Saudi Arabia, how an average English woman responds to the loss of a husband, and seeks to earn a living, then this book is for you.   If, on the other hand, you would like to be the able to enter that country, to see what you will never be able to see because you are an outsider; if you expect detailed descriptions that would enlighten you as to how to these people live within and without the palace, then this book is not for you.  For this is more about Phyllis Ellis than it is about Saudi Arabia.<BR>   <BR>That life in Saudi Arabia is restricted for women and men is a given.  That it must be very difficult to live there is also understandable.  But what I missed about the book were good, detailed descriptions.  For instance we learn that she sleeps in a big high bed, from which she falls and twists her ankle.  But what about the rest of her room?  Did this palace have rugs on the marble floors?  Were they Persian?  Were they colorful?  Were there plants indoors?  What are the prevalent colors?  Do people curtsy?  She mentions the boring landscape of the public parks outside the palace.  But why was it boring?  Was it repetitive?     Was it just grass?  We don't know.  The lack of detail makes this adventure very generic and too concerned with the author's emotional state.  The information she provides about customs and geography, about Ramadan and date palms could all be acquired from a good text book.  Because I expected to see through someone else's eyes, I was disappointed.	2002-02-01
US	42224601	R28NJJ1BJJI5D9	0618065822	284454677	Fasting, Feasting	Books	4	5	6	N	Y	Two lives	These are two stories which stand on their own: one of a woman whose personal needs are forever postponed by family and society obligations and the other of a family incapable of discerning the needs of its members and of its visitor. The juxtaposition of these stories increases their impact, for both deal with the everyday  accumulation of pressures and frustrations, which can amount to a lifetime of doom or to life-threatening actions.  Desai's characters are imprisoned by their inability to change their own expectations or those placed upon them by others.   Anita Desai's marvelous command of language transforms, with tender irony and a light sense of humor, these otherwise gloomy lives into delightful characters despite their fragility.  It is pure magic and a pleasure to read!	2002-01-31

I read it twice because the story haunted me, not unlike the way Iran haunts Feri.  The bonus comes from a portrayal of Iran from the inside, a knowledge precious to me an arm chair traveller.  This is a thoughtful, extremely concise and well written book, introspective and beautiful.  A quiet adventure.	2002-01-27
