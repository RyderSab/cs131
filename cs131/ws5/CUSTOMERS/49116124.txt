Hopefully, this writer will go on writing, because I noticed that this was published in the year 2000.  Why did I like it?  It was fast paced, terse, and he got right into the story without having written one superfluous word.  And that's a good thing in this age of overly written, self indulgent fiction.  Also, it was edgy and at times down right disturbing.	2004-03-28

I was born and raised in Brooklyn and can personally testify that what you will read in these pages are as true to life back then as you'll find in any piece of American literature.  Herbert Selby Jr. has given us a savage glimpse into a world possessed by demons in human form.

There is a mystery that pervades his poems and stories, and a mastery of language that puts him in a class all his own.  Besides, there are lesser known stories in this collection, such as &quot;William Wilson,&quot; and &quot;A Man of The Crowd,&quot; which are utterly mesmerizing in both design and implication.  But if you're looking for the commonplace you won't find it here.  Poe was a surrealist before the word was invented, and it is quite obvious that he abhorred the commonplace.  <br />Actually, his life is also quite interesting - dark and shadowy and full of contradiction.  Even the circumstances that surround his demise are interesting to ponder.  We had to wait until the advent of Kafka to find another writer who was as intriguing as Edgar Allan Poe.	2003-02-24

Poe is perhaps one of the most influential writers America has ever produced.  Though known mostly as a critic in his own time, his stories were translated into French by the great French Poet, Charles Baudelaire, and thus his reputation started to spread in Europe, where he had a deep effect on writers such as Dickens and Doestoyevsky.  And it's no wonder, since his stories are excellently crafted with many layers of subtle psychological meanings.  \\"The Tell Tale Heart\\" for instance stands out in my mind as one of the penultimate tales of terror that was ever created by his sometimes feverish imagination.  It could almost be read as a confession by a madman in an asylum.  Then there's the deeply symbolic tale, \\"The Mosque of the Red Death.\\"  A truly moral tale for a man who had a rep for being a drunkard in his own lifetime.  Strange, Hemingway, who drank gallons of booze, is never critiqued for this weakness, but poor Poe has suffered for his malady and is not given his proper place in the curriculum of our universities, though now his works are widely read and are being reassessed.  For Poe was indeed a great master and perhaps 200 hundred years ahead of his time.<br />So read Poe - and you'll be equally horrorfied and entertained forevermore!	2002-11-03

It contains valuable suggestions for harnessing the power of the subconsious mind and predates the bio feedback revolution of the 70's by decades.

But Walt Whitman was and still is one of the most influential poets I have ever read.  He began life on a farm on Long Island, but times got bad and his family uprooted itself and moved to Brooklyn.  Brooklyn at that time was a growing city unto itself and trades were needed.  Thus Whitman learned the trade of printer.  But his soul led him to a higher calling.  He became a jounrnalist and wrote poetry.  His early efforts did not amount to anything major.  Yet sometimes the unimaginable happens in a man's life.  A sudden thrust of inspiration strikes one like a bolt of lightning.  Then something new and unique is born out of this inception - a new form of poetry - what is today referred to as free verse.  Yes, Whitman is the father of the form, and perhaps one of its greatest practitioners.  The beat poets who were to follow in his footsteps never really rose to his great height of mystic revelation.  I think that's what the other reviewers are talking about when they refer to Whitman's religiosity.  For Whitman was the poet of a new world, a new nation, a growing entity that would go on to fulfill an old dream of mankind.  That is, the dream of a thoroughly new man, a man who was free from the past, a man who could find his soul was one with the fathomless cosmos.  Hence, &quot;Walt Whitman, a cosmos&quot; is a very telling way Whitman has of describing himself to his reader.  <br />My favorite poem by Walt Whitman is his &quot;Song of Myself.&quot;  It contains the seed of everything he had lived as a human being and every vision he would realize as a mystic of epic proportions.  After that, I believe his next great poem was &quot;I Sing The Body Electric.&quot;  &quot;Drum Taps&quot; was also quite an interesting addition to &quot;Leaves of Grass.&quot;  Also, &quot;When Lilacs Last In The Dooryard Bloomed&quot; is Whitman at his poetic best.<br />So it is without any reservation that I am highly recommending &quot;Leaves Of Grass&quot; to all and sundry as a must read.  Especially now, in the wake of 9/11 we need to reaffirm what it means to be American, and I know of no better American Visionary to help in this cause then Walt Whitman.	2002-09-18

It goes deep into the roots of eastern religion with poetry, grace, insight, and wisdom.  In its pages perhaps you will find the meaning of life, perhaps not.  In any event, you will read a great novel.<br />It is the story of Siddhartha, the son of a Brahmin.  Early on Siddhartha leaves home with his friend Govinda to search for the meaning of life.  Like the Buddha he studies meditation and practices austere aceticism in an endeavor to win liberation and experience moksha, or enlightenment as it is called here in the west.<br />He gains several mental powers but always enlightenment remains just beyond his reach.  So he and Govinda leave the Samanas of the mountains and caves.<br />On their journey back to society they encounter The Historic Buddha, the original founder of the Buddhist faith.  They are both impressed with his holiness and Govinda decides to become a follower, however, Siddhartha, because of his astute intelect, finds a flaw in The Buddha's doctrine.<br />So he meets with him in a bamboo grove under the light of the moon and expresses his thoughts to The Buddha.  The Buddha in turn acknowledges Siddhartha's intelegence but also cautions him to beware of his own cleverness.  What it comes down to is that The Buddha sees the intelect as an obstacle, while Siddhartha sees all religious teachings as provisional, for to his mind he knows The Buddha is enlightened.  But he has also ascertained that enlightenment is an experience and that this experience must be experienced directly for oneself, for it is beyond the power of words... Words are useful to convey concepts and ideas, but enlightenment is a transcendent reality that is beyond the power of words to describe.  Even The Buddha said:  I am merely a finger pointing to the moon, don't mistake my finger for the moon.<br />Siddhartha then goes on to leave Govinda behind and re-enter the world, where he meets Kamala, a beautiful prostitute, and eventually he forgets his quest for wisdom, and immerses himself in sex, money, gambling and other mundane pursuits that eventually bring him to a state of nausea - possibly the same kind of nausea that Gautama Buddha experienced the night he left his Palace and exchanged his royal clothes for the rags of a beggar.<br />I could go on telling you more and more about this wonderful book.  But the sacred river where Siddhartha hears the sacred sounds will tell you infinitely more.  You simply have to read the book and listen for yourself.ostitute, and eventually he forgets his quest for wisdom, and immerses himself in sex, money, gambling and other mundane pursuits that eventually bring him to a state of nausea - possibly the same kind of nausea that Gautama Buddha experienced the night he left his Palace and exchanged his royal clothes for the rags of a beggar.<br />I could go on telling you more and more about this wonderful book.

It's only a pity that in this prosaic world of comercialism and superficialities, the pure voice of a pure poet is often drowned out in the din of our brutal existence.  Still, I highly recommend this book!  It's especially good reading for adolescents.  For like Socrates, Mr. Di Paola is concerned with the education of our youth.

Here you will find the lean descriptive prose that made him one of the finest writer's of the twentieth century.<br />It tells the story of a fisherman who is down on his luck, but whose spirit is strong as the tropical winds that have tanned his skin and the sun that has made weak his eyes.  He is devoted to the sea and knows all of its wildness and subtle moods.  He goes out alone one day without his sidekick boy companion, because the boy's family has forbidden him to help his teacher for he has bad luck.<br />He hooks a Marlin, a huge mythical Marlin, the kind that fishermen only dream of catching.  And the fish drags him out deeper and deeper into the ocean, farther than he's ever traveled.  The battle is fierce and his hands are even bloodied as he ties himself to the rope and the fish in a struggle that is somehow symbolic of man's eternal quest to gain control over natural forces.<br />I would say more, however, Hemingway has done such a fine job that I suggest you read and read this wonderful tale.  The ending is of course classic Hemingway.  And it was for this book that Hemingway won the Nobel Prize for literature.	2002-03-03

He was a friend of Emerson's and a Transcendentalist. He saw the beauty of life and how we mortals squander it with too much getting and spending. He was a man who not only stopped to smell the sacred scents of nature, he went on to become imbued with the great truths that permeated the wood and the pond that he loved so dearly. In an idyllic sense, he was a man for all seasons, a man who took on authority and questioned its right to dictate over the life of the individual.<br />This was indeed his great theme, for he said: &quot;I am too high born to be the property of any government.&quot; And he also said, &quot;That government which governs best governs least.&quot; But I doubt the conservatives can claim him as one of their own. For he was among other things a staunch abolitionist, and he was also against America's involvement in the war with Mexico, (the Viet Nam of its day). So what has changed? Not much.  Life is still a battle between the individual's rights and needs against societie's injustices and a life of conformity.  <br />But even if you never read Walden please think about this quote: &quot;Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed and in such desperate enterprises? If a man can not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears the beat of a different drummer. Let each man step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.&quot; Now that's something I can sink my teeth into!	2000-11-13

Being a native of Brooklyn myself I feel a deep connection to him.  When I read his work I am instantly transported into his universe, a universe which is the domain of every man.  For Walt Whitman was possibly the greatest democrat who ever lived.<br />In his great poem, Song of Myself, his opening lines are:  &quot;I celebrate myself, and what I assume you shall assume, for every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.&quot;  This is not only good old American horse sense, it's good science.  For everything comes forth from that great source of life the sun, and none can be better for it, only different.  <br />Walt was a born visionary.  And I surmise that he must have had quite a few mystical experiences before he set out to write his great poems.  You can really get a sense of his mystical connection when you read poems like When I Heard The Learned Astronomer or even in Song of Myself when he proclaims:  &quot;There was never any more inception than there is now, nor any more youth or age than there is now; and will never be any more perfection than there is now, nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.&quot;  Notice the emphasis on the word now.  Mystics through the ages have said that God is beyond time, that God is the eternal presence, and that he exists in a timeless eternity sometimes referred to as the eternal now.  I believe that's what Walt Whitman is telling us.<br />I could go on and on singing the praises of Walt Whitman.  His work is inexhaustable and profound and wise beyond measure.  But there are innumerable books written about him.  However, I believe to catch the essence of the man you have to read his poems.  And if you let him in he will lead you to yourself and you will see the world through fresh eyes .... and you will see how the perennial grass covers only the outer layer of this our miraculous universe.	2000-11-11

It is replete with characters that are zany and unforgettable. There are men who dream of loves they've lost and women they have known. There are artists who hide their talents behind the artifice of the mundane world; nightmare scenerios converge with the commonplace and it all makes for a fictive world that quivers on the edge of a dream. And yet the author pays his respect to the everyday absurdies through his wonderful prose and minute attention to details.<br />For instance, in The City Of New Beginnings he describes one of his finest characters, Miss Lena thus: &quot;Yes, Miss Lena had transformed herself. She had become a lone planet, a mass of bright, then darker colors, a revolving planet where birds and butterflies, snakes and spiders came to life with her every movement, her every breath. Then the music stopped, and a siren cut through the blind. When the doorbell rang Miss Lena dressed herself in a hurry, and as I watched her I thought to myself that hers were the most beautiful, the most timeless scars that I would ever see.&quot;<br />On reading this book I had the uncanny feeling that I was being pulled into a mad theatre of strange tales and unusual dreamscapes that were like the paintings of Dali or Borsh. Yet it's all there to behold in the powerful prose of Militello, who is indeed a great new force to be reckoned with. For he has burst upon the tepid literary scene like a streak of lightning through storm laden sky.<br />I look forward to reading more from this writer, until then I'll just go on reading and rereading this fascinating book.	2000-11-04

It is where the author lays bare his soul and reveals the conflicts of his heart, conflicts that were to plague him for the rest of his life, conflicts that are reflected in all of his writings.<br />He was a strange man haunted by contrary of thoughts of fate and redemption vs. freedom and autonomy.  And nowhere is this conflict better expressed than in Notes From The Underground.  The protagonist is a self proclaimed spiteful man who is intelligent and disdainful of his contemporaries.  He is a masochist and in his pain he doubts the validity of the ideal of happiness.  He does not believe that life improves. He prefers exalted suffering to shallow happiness.  He dreads the coming of the scientific age where he claims man will be reduced to a mere cipher on a page of endless numbers.   He asserts that what makes us human is our will to rebel against the facts.  <br />Later Dostoyevsky became obsessed with the theme of redemption through suffering.  But this timeless theme fuels his imagination and peoples his novels with unforgettable characters.  <br />So I recommend this seminal novel as a wonderful prelude to reading the great novels which followed in its wake.  It is a disturbing book.  But it's true to life and to the realism which made Dosstoyevsky the father of modern existentialism and sociology.	2000-11-04

His tales of horror have sent chills up and down the spines of their readers for several generations. His better known stories are all masterpieces of the genre of the macabre. As for his lesser known tales, they too are complex masterpieces of pyschological horror. And I use the word pyschological because Poe was aware of the inner workings of the human mind before Freud or Jung. He loves to explore the dark side of the human psyche, and no one has or ever will do it with as much power and mastery as did Poe.<br />Also, Poe was a master of language and his ear was exquisitely tuned to the sounds of words. His poetry is perhaps the most tuneful in the English language. Listen to the music of the first sentence of The Fall Of The House Of Usher: \\"During the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country, and at length found myself, as the shades of evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher.\\" You see, Poe understood both tone and atmosphere and how to weave these elements into his narrative; thereby creating a lasting effect in the minds of his readers. <br />I remember when first I read The Tell-Tale Heart how the opening paragraph pulled me into the strange intensity of Poe's madness. It begins thus: \\"True!-nervous-very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am! but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses-not destroyed-not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily-how calmly I can tell you the whole story.\\" But it is the story of a madman and in the end will not prove him sane. In point of fact, it will draw its reader ever deeper into the infernal regions of Poe's pysche, where he will hear the few things of heaven and the many demonic things of hell. <br />I have always loved the intense way in which Poe uses language to attain his metaphysical revelations of the state of a brilliant mind that is on the verge of disintergration. For it is in the order that he brings to this nightmarish chaos that one begins to understand that Poe's dark genius is capable of the highest degree of intuition. And that he is an explorer of regions of the mind that others dare never to explore for fear of what they might find. <br />So I recommend reading Poe's stories and poems for the sheer thrill of it, but also for the complexities of his craftmanship and the subtle way in which he weaves upon the magic loom of his incredible imagination.	2000-10-26

Reflect for awhile on these lines from Jewel's poem entitled Love Poem: &quot;I wander the continent of your golden valleys without ceasing, and delight each day in discovering a new dawn, rising from the depths of your mysterious being.&quot; To my mind this is a wonderful metaphor about the birth of beauty that arises from a newly awakened love, a love which is bright and flowing with deep poetic sentiment. <br />In other poems Jewel is a bit more raw and less refined in her poetic expressions. But in any event, she is always honest in her honest revelations of the world. Here is an excellent example of this, the darker side of her poetic vision: &quot;They suck on coffee with great indifference, their young thighs weapons they have cocked, hardly comprehending the potency which lies in suggestion.&quot; This is a lament of innocence lost to a world that abuses what could be a great gift, the gift of sensuality with all its magic and power. In these few lines from her poem Coffee Shop, Jewel lays bare the heart of the matter. It is a fact of life that women have to or think they have to use their bodies and their sensuality to procure what they want out of life. It speaks volumes and few women poets have handled this theme with such delicacy.<br />Take for instance the short but poignant poem Pretty. It reads: &quot;There is a pretty girl on the face of the magazine, and all I can see are my dirty hands turning the page.&quot; It's easy to imagine the details. Jewel stifled in a small town atmosphere is dreaming of the gorgeous life of a hollywood star or possibly a fashion model. She has not yet attained the awareness of the emptiness that is at the top of that illusory image of beauty; nor has she felt the sting of the critics who because of their lack of understanding dolittle else but clutter up pages with their jeering words. This happens a bit later on in the book. Take for example these lines from Tai Pei: &quot;I have no lover, only a pen and an answering machine back in the states which no one calls. I am told I am adored by millions, but no one calls.&quot; Again, Jewel reveals the dark side of fame and fortune, and one gets the feeling that though she is somewhat addicted to her new life style there is something in her soul which longs to be free of it. <br />So all and all, I would have to say such insights in such a young poet are rare. And Jewel is an excellent poet for our times. Hopefully her fame as a singer will not overshadow her poetic achievements, and judging from what I've read thus far they will be considerable.	2000-10-20

This new book of hers, Chasing Down The Dawn, is full of memorable stories and anecdotes from her life.  The pictures of her self and her family are a kind of home photo album that bring you closer to the artist's heart.  On reading this book I had the feeling that I was sitting in Jewel's living room with her and she was telling me stories about her childhood and her success as an artist.  As always Jewel manages to lay bare her soul in a most entertaining way - I believe this is a book well worth any readers attention, even if they're not a total Jewel fan.  There's much insight into human nature in its pages.  And I feel better off for having read it.	2000-10-20
