Some less-than-fortunate things happened in the 1980's, but many less-than-fortuante things happen in every decade. It seems Johnson wants to blame Reagan for Wall Street goons, weather problems, a supposedly poor economy(which data and history show is totally false, the Laffer curve was correct), and a fight against South American communism, among many other aspects of those years. Why didn't he just look at this nation in 1975-1980. It wasn't pretty. By 1988, America was an economic powerhouse with world superiority and a beacon of freedom and democracy.<br />Was Ronald Reagan a perfect president? No, but who is? He certainly is one of the best of the 20th century, though, even if Johnson disagrees.	2002-03-22

These were the ideas Gingrich brought to Congress; a Congress which hadn't had any kind of new ideas for almost five decades.<br />The major themes of this book are about implementing limited, common sense government, having faith in the local community to make decisions and solve problems, using personal responsibility, and shifting power from the federal government to the people.<br />To my surprise, Gingrich talks of his love of animals and the environment with great detail in this book. To listen to the media and left-wing journalists, one would think Gingrich only cared about drilling for oil in Yellowstone national park. Read his book and you'll see it's not true.	2001-07-06

He proves that most liberals want government controlling everything from the economy, schools, healthcare, and most depressingly, our lives. His main point in the book is that no one in America needs to be taken care of by the government. Our economy offers so much opportunity the anyone can make it no matter their race, class, sex, religion, etc. Boortz claims liberals want people poor and helpless so they can get the reputation as being compassionate. But, this ends up ruining lives and makes for a complacent and apathetic society. Boortz believes that ending entitlements and welfare will force people to become motivated and responsible.  <br />The main theme you can derive from this book is that people should be free to use their own money, make decisions for themselves and their children, and be free of government's grasp. According to Boortz, liberalism is against what these principles stand for. And he's right.	2001-04-10

Armey shows why and how Freedom is vital to ensure success for any nation. He begins with a quick history lesson, about how President Reagan gave the people the Freedom to use their own money with his large tax cuts, and how our national economy was transformed from stagnant to superlative.  He goes on to show how Freedom and privatization can work in any area of public life: the economy, education, social security, medicare, and helping the needy.<br />His main ponit is that government cannot do all the things people want it to do. He stresses that large government is dangerous and can cause irresponsibility just as it has in our inner cities with welfare. Only with Freedom from government can people be trusted to make their own decisions and use their money as they see fit. <br />Dr. Armey's chapter on abortion and education can really open your eyes to see the real meaning of being pro-life and wanting a better future for our children. Unfortunately, many liberals would call Dr. Armey cold-hearted, mean, or insensitive. He is actually a realist who only wants government to stay out of our way so we can help ourselves as well as others. Through privatization, deregulation, responsibility, and trust can we in America overcome the shackles of big government and truly be Free.<br />And for those people who speak of Dr. Armey's gun control stance, no where in the book did he speak of gun control. Which book did you read?	2001-04-05

But, to really understand it, as well as the other ideas of Adam Smith, read his essential works. This book allows the reader to fully grasp the concepts of capitalism and get a clear picture of how and why it works. Thankfully, Heilbronner did not dilute the works of Smith, he just condensed them for the modern day reader.

The drawings may be a little strange, but the text is fantastic and the pictures are classic. The highlight of the book was the all-time team picks.

It seems most writers who tackle the topic of the decline in American culture usually look at poor parenting, large government, drugs, inept schooling, or a combination of these among others. Cal Thomas claims many of our present day problems stem from the extreme gap between church and state and that those who call for such a large gap only hurt our country more. Some of the material in the book does get a bit too much into fundamentalism, but overall Thomas tries to prove that the loss of devotion to God, family, and the Bible has taken our nation down the wrong path. <br />I can't say I recommend this book if you want a purely non-religious view of our society's struggles.  But, if you feel that America has taken a turn for the worse because of mass secularization and have desire a return to a religious society, read Thomas' book. Personally, I'd prefer a society with more discipline and respect, with definite need for religion, of course, but Thomas claims the only way to reverse America's unfortunate trend of decline is to accept spirituality in all facets of life.	2000-11-07

Their main objective was to improve conditions for families, create an opportunity society, and balance the budget. In my opinion, they succeeded at all three, and then some. Through emphasizing personal responsibility, trusting the individual, and placing power back in the hands of state and local authorities did the Republicans promote their message that large, inefficient government was useless and harmful and that decentralization truly epitomizes compassionate conservatism. Now that we have a balanced budget, welfare reform, lower crime, and booming economy, the GOP can take credit for the work they performed to make these unattainable goals during Democrat-run Congresses a reality. These men and women proved that lower taxation, deregulation, limited government, and faith in the local community can make the American dream possible.	2000-10-27

He lost though, and the government adopted huge programs that are still costing America to this day.  Goldwater's brand of libertarian/conservative politics were responsible, compassionate, and not a burden on the American public. The large welfare state, wasteful education programs, inefficient social security programs, and other government controlled entities would not have been created had Goldwater's policies been accepted.  He clearly explains why the federal government should stay out of the lives of the people and business, not only because it is for the good of the society, but the Constitution calls for it as well. Goldwater believed in expanding states' rights and letting liberty and freedom with responsibility be the norm in society, not a far-reaching  goal.  Had his ideas and precepts taken effect with his desired presidency, America would have been a far different, and better, place to live.	2000-10-17

Mauro's book will keep you chuckling from beginning to end. He satirically attacks such liberals as Al Franken, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barney Frank, Jesse Jackson, the Hollywood elite, left-wing journalists, and anyone else who gets in his way.  He starts off by explaining how he became a conservative and how he disagrees with its ideologies. He criticizes the narrow-minded, bleeding-heart mentality of liberalism, the hypocritical, elitist attitude of many modern liberals, and the backward agenda of many liberal organizations like PETA ....  In all, Mauro generally gives his brash opinions of his views and discredits overblown liberalism. <br />The author also offers a chapter on why he is a Republican. It is a humorous, indirect attack on liberalism because Mauro talks about regular events in a typical day that seem like anyone does, but when he says it, it seems like proud conservatism. His eggs and meat for breakfast, his large car, his attending a regular barbershop for a haircut, and his praying at the end of the day.  Many liberals, according to Mauro, would not want anything to do with these activities or events. <br />Overall, Mauro succeeds in his attempt to refute Al Franken's book and absent-mindedness of modern liberals. Throughout the book, I was laughing at the many observations Mauro makes. The index is hilarious. His references to Franken in the index are a bit childish, but really made me laugh. For a very funny payback to Al Franken and his liberal pals, J.P. Mauro's book can open your eyes while giving you a good laugh.	2000-10-13

I'll admit Newt Gingrich is not going to win the character of the year award, but his treatise, along with approval from his fellow Republicans, was a stepping-stone to ensure that wasteful, inefficient liberal spending was ended and fiscal responsibility was integrated.  Because of this, we enjoy the budget surpluses of today.  <br />Unfortunately, not all parts of the Contract were signed into law, but what did get signed clearly shows in what it set out to accomplish.  Gingrich takes on many issues like budget deficits, welfare, crime, family issues, judicial affairs, the size of government, and job creation and offers commons sense ideas on how to either improve in these areas or solve these burdens on the American people. He gives hypothetical myths and answers with actual facts, and how the Contract was not some kind of political stunt or way to win voters. It was a necessary collection of ideas that stress personal and fiscal responsibility, limited government, liberty, and safety at home and abroad. It also preaches the need to end modern liberal spending pracices and return to more sensical limits to government's scope and power. Luckily for America, the Contract started the ball rolling to clean up government and give more voice to the people who desire the power to fix America's problems.	2000-10-10

Maybe political pundits or media journalists were outraged or split when it came to the President's misbehavior, but, by and large, the American people were not.  Dr. Bennett shows in his book that the American people were still giving a man who committed illegal and immoral acts high approval ratings even though he did not deserve them.  Most people just looked at the economy, (which Clinton did not really help as much as many want to say), and looked the other way.  This could and probably will have future grim effects on this country.  <br />Dr. Bennett wisely took every argument that a Clinton defender could make and refuted the claims.  If we accept unacceptable behavior, we in America have for most intents and purposes given up on our public officials.  Bennett tries to explain that if we only care about our own position in the world, and not judge behavior that should be condemned, our nation will experience a cultural and moral collapse.<br />The real shame was the examples of &quot;death of outrage&quot;.  So many people, including, Reverend Billy Graham did not seem to care about the President's inexcusable actions. The comments by Ann Landers did give me a good chuckle, though.  She seems to have abandoned her convictions, if she had any to start with.<br />Overall, Dr. Bennett's book is a quick, pleasurable read that unfortunately deals with a topic that had to be talked about.  Because people like Dr. Bennett actually care for our nation, maybe some of that death will come back to life.	2000-09-23

He cuts through all the misconceptions about the Reagan years and proves that they were a success.  Craig begins by talking about Reagan's successes in foreign matters and how he helped change the world for the better.  He played a key role in the demise of Soviet Communism, and also helped other nations with their fight for freedom and independence from Communism.  Craig then went on to defend Reaganomics.  To the dismay of many opponents, it really was a success.  Many say the 1980's was about greed, but with the cut of marginal taxes by Reagan, that allowed more opportunity for charitable contributions, which increased.  Our economy also experienced &quot;seven fat years&quot; that gave America the greatest economy until now.  Overall, Reganomics started the economic recovery that needed to happen after the 1970's, and its policies continue to today.  Craig also was correct when he said the deficits and debt were not all Reagan's fault.  It was the fault of an ever-growing federal government and Congress that spend irresponsibly.  Finally, Craig went on to talk about Reagan's success in social matters.  He proved Reagan was not aloof or ignorant or even uncaring about social issues.  He tried to appoint judges that would make sound decisions for America, but these people were shunned and ridiculed by the left-wing of America. We may not have the social problems we do today had Reagan's choices had a chance to make an impact on America.  <br />The only complaint I have with Craig's essay is that he did not focus enough on Reagan's leadership skills. This aspect may have been his greatest asset. He gave America purpose and showed we can overcome any obstacle because the American spirit is stronger than any material object.  If you want the facts and not rumors or left-wing truth-bending, Mickey Craig's essay gives you what you need.  It proves the 1980's in America were a success, and so was Ronald Reagan.	2000-09-21

He is truly a genuine man and cares about his  profession and the Constitution.  He does a fine job exposing some less  than genuine people in Washington, especially the least genuine person of  them all: President Clinton.  Truthfully, I didn't give the book 5 stars  because there really was nothing shockingly new.  But, it was disheartening  to learn how the Republican Senate sold out the House Managers, men who  were just doing their jobs.  It was even more stressing to read how the  Democrats never even wanted to consider the facts, just to help one of  their own.  The worst was how the President used his power to sell out just  about everyone in America. The things Clinton's cronies did to Kathleen  Willey seem like something out of a movie.  That was really frightening.   But, Schippers had to show those things to show the truth. Schippers proves  that Clinton can do this to anyone who crosses him, and why he deserved at  least to get impeached.   Overall, it's a shame Schippers had to receive  such hate mail.  He was only trying to do his job, and he did it admirably.   The letters he received bashing him show how so many people don't care  about justice, right vs. wrong, the Constitution, or  America as a whole.	2000-09-19

There were things in the book I did not  even know Clinton did.  Illegal and immoral things.

King's writing style is very readable and accurate.  It  shows the greatest players, teams, games, and people from seven decades of  pro football.  I never knew how much Packer great Don Hutson ruled the  game.  King put him number one as the greatest of all time.  If you look at  the stats, you'll see why. And I'm a Bears fan!<br />The only ommission was  Deacon Jones. I never saw him play but from what I have heard, he was one  of the greatest of the greats. Either King forgot about him, or he did not  think he was worthy.  Jones is mentioned nowhere in the whole book.  I  would think he'd be in the top 10.<br />Anyway, this book is excellent. It  captures all the great moments and people and shows why pro football is  such a special game.  If you want a good history lesson and see some great  pictures, buy this book.	2000-08-28

Rush again takes many issues of today and dissects them  to try to get to the truth.  Like his first book, I can't say I agree with  everything he says, but most of what he says is genuine and intriguing.   What I did not like was the constant liberal bashing.  Even though I  consider myself a moderate consevative, there are many liberals out there  who are not like the modern liberals today.  These are the good liberals,  but Rush seems to bunch them all into one category of people he dislikes.   I will admit that I too do not like modern liberalism, either.   What I did  like was how Rush laid out the facts about how traditional conservatism  really works.  He shows that conservatism is not about cold hearted rich  people, anti-minority groups, anti-poor groups, or anti-gun control nuts.   It is about being self-reliant, using common sense, family values, respect  for life, lower taxation, freedom with responsibility, and minimal  government.  Rush succeeds at getting this point across, probably to the  dismay of modern liberals.  Luckily, Rush doesn't care, and his book  benefits from it.	2000-08-27

Because he wants this country to be where it once was before  liberalism took over, that's why.  He takes many issues, shows how we  should approach them (with common sense and a moral mindset) and doesn't  care what modern liberals think.  I don't agree with everything he says,  but he is a very agreeable man. He wants this once proud nation where it  was when people actually cared, when the middle class wasn't overtaxed,  when politicians cared more about the people than their own selfish  desires, and when America's spirit was strong.  Now, with liberalism  running rampant, the spirit of America has been aborted like so many  innocent babies.  Limbaugh's sound conservative thoughts, even though the  book is eight years old, can be a stepping stone to overcome liberalism and  take America back.  I suggest this book if you like politics or just care  about America.	2000-08-11

These barbaric vikings were brutal in battle and exceptional warriors, but they also seemed to have a side to them that the reader can  care about.  Ibn Fadlan depending on Herger the translator, Buliwyf showing  courage through the journey while still accepting Fadlan, an outsider, into  his clan, and the rest of the warriors fighting against evil and enjoying  it  are examples of how I gained interest in their personalities.  I almost  wanted to jump in and fight with them against the monsters of the mist. I  don't want to give anything away, but I almost felt sorry for the vikings  at the end.

Robert Bork showed me that he is committed to making the US a proud and powerful nation not only in stature but in spirit. <br />How could Bork be wrong for wanting the American family strong and moral citizens praised for their actions in society?  But, today this is politically incorrect talk.  Today hardcore homosexuals and criminals and unwed pregnant women and the ones who are felt compassion for and admired.  Why, because of their actions which are either unnatural or just plain ignorant.  I am tired of all this.  A white, middle-class, heterosexual man who shows any kind of pride is now considered racist, homophobic, and anti-woman.  But, those who disagree with me all just think Bork's work is laughable and cold-hearted.  No wonder we are in the position we are today.<br />Unless the morality in this once great country improves, we are destined to suffer a fate that is unimaginable. Hopefully modern liberals will see the error in their ways and use common sense.  I do not want to offend classical liberalism, just this modern liberalism that has engulfed the country.  Do I want everyone to become as conservative as Bork? No, but don't you modern liberals want a country based on morals and wise judgement.  I guess not, and future generations will suffer because of it.	2000-06-26

I do not know too much about politics or how Washington works, but his thoughts for a better tomorrow seem very agreeable to me.  His ideas for non-violent  offenders be put in a boot camp seems very smart, it would alleviate some  pressure on the crumbling prison system and it would rehabilitate these  people instead of just punishing them for their stupidity.  I also liked  his ideas of saving social security and stopping the national debt from  growing.  We need to do something about these problems now to keep the  future from turning ugly.  I did disagree with Nelson on some issues,  though.  He seemed to favor a pro-choice stand on abortion, even though he  really did not get into that topic much.  Personally, abortion is selfish  and against the Declaration of Independence's claim of life, liberty, and  pursuit of happiness.  He also seemed to be against the second amendment.   He wanted it changed to be more contemporary, but I think the issue should  be more about education and better parenting than government involvement.   Nelson also wants mandatory voting registration.  It's your decision to  kill an unborn child but you must be required by law to vote?  That's why  we live in America, we do not have to vote if we do not want to.  I do  agree with his argument, though, that more people need to vote and that  elected officials would rather have a small number of faithful voters  because it's less people to influence.  Overall, I agree with Nelson that  our society is decaying.  Our elected officials, Democrat and Republican,  (see I don't hate Clinton), all seem to be corrupt and uncaring from  president on down, that is why we need to make a Last Call and return to  glory.  Spread the word, Rob.	2000-05-28
