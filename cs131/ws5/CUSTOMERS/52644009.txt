I became a Val McDermid fan when I read &quot;A Place of Execution&quot;, but it's taken me a while to read her earlier works,  largely because they are difficult to find in the US.  My perserverance was rewarded when I found &quot;Open and Shut&quot; in the library last week.  McDermid's heroine, Lindsay Gordon, has returned to the UK after a self-imposed exile in Italy.  A former journalist, she is asked to look into the conviction of a friend, Jackie Mitchell.  Mitchell is accused of killing Alison Maxwell, a brilliant but amoral journalist who was once Linday's lover.  Lindsay's investigations reveal that this case is far more complex than anyone could have imagined.<br />This novel is brilliantly detailed, with engrossing characters and gripping plot.  The setting among professional lesbian women in Glasgow was at first daunting and a little bit foreign, but the story drew me in.  These ladies are women like me and my friends, smart, funny and professionally dedicated.  Read this book--if you can find it!	2004-05-16

Rei Shimura is a young Japanese-American woman living in Tokyo.  Like many of us, she's underemployed: despite her master's in Asian art, she's working as an English teacher.  Rei becomes involved in a murder while vacationing in the Japanese Alps.  This is both an engrossing mystery and a fascinating glimpse into modern Japanese culture.  Another reason to appreciate Ms. Massey: she's a fellow Johns Hopkins graduate and Baltimore resident!	2003-05-25

Will Shakespeare is a 19-year-old school teacher, barely able to make ends meet for his wife and baby daughter.  Then his wife and child disappear, taken by the \\"good people\\", the fairies, and Will must join forces with Quicksilver, an enigmatic elf, to save them.<br />I definitely recommend this book for any fantasy or Shakespeare lover--and especially for anyone who loves both! Ms. Hoyt shows a side of Shakespeare I'd never considered.  Conventional wisdom has it that Shakespeare and Ann Hathaway had an unhappy marriage, based on the evidence of the second-best bed, etc.  Here we see Shakespeare in love (no pun intended) with his older, strong-minded wife.<br />Part of the fun of this book was identifying the many references to Shakespeare's plays.  I noted \\"Hamlet\\", \\"As You Like It\\", \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", and many others, and I probably missed quite a few.  <br />The moral of this review: catch this book before, like fairy magic, it disappears.	2002-06-02

Irene Adler, heroine of &quot;Good Night, Mr. Holmes&quot; and other novels, returns in this great addition to the series.  Sherlock Holmes fans will recall that Holmes always referred to her as &quot;the Woman&quot; after she outwits him in &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;.  Irene, along with her sidekick Nell and her husband Godfrey, ably carries her own series.  I heartily recommend all of the Irene Adler books to any lover of mysteries.<br />&quot;Chapel Noir&quot; finds Irene and Nell embroiled in a hunt for a demented killer.  The year is 1889.  Jack the Ripper--aka &quot;Saucy Jack&quot;--prowled the streets of London's East End only the previous fall.  No arrests were ever made in the Ripper murders.  Could the Ripper have moved his operation to Paris? With the able assistance of Pink, a young American woman, Irene and Nell pursue the killer through the streets and catacombs of Paris.<br />I have only one quibble with this book: because the story will be continued in the next volume, the cliff-hanger ending leaves the reader hanging.  But this unsatisfying climax only whets the reader's appetite for more.	2002-01-06

In &quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot;, Terry Pratchett returns to his &quot;Guards of Ankh-Morpork&quot; storyline, last seen in &quot;Feet of  Clay&quot;, &quot;Men at Arms&quot; and &quot;Guards, Guards&quot;.  This  time, Sam Vimes--Commander of the Watch and the Duke of Ankh-Morpork--is  off to neighboring Uberwald to attend the coronation of the Low King.   Uberwald, as fans will remember from &quot;Carpe Jugulum&quot;, is  inhabited by vampires and werewolves.  Of course, nothing goes as planned.   The Scone of Stone--the traditional &quot;throne&quot; of the Low King--has  been stolen, the dwarves are divided over the choice of Low King, and the  Watch is on strike.<br />One of Pratchett's strengths is to make you laugh  even as he makes you think.  This has been evident in his last several  books, especially &quot;Small Gods&quot;, and I'm glad he's keeping up the  good work.  In this book, the questions are many: how do you deal with a  werewolf who won't take stop trying to kill you? Should people from  different worlds pursue a relationship? Mr. Pratchett even touches on  traditional male-female roles (or the lack thereof among dwarves) and the  power of faith.  Humor is good, but humor that waxes lightly philosophical  is even better.	2000-08-04

Her  second greatest strength is her wonderful descriptive prose that draws the  reader into her fantasy world.  In &quot;Spindle's End&quot; she displays  both gifts to advantage.<br />We've all heard the Sleeping Beauty story, but  Ms. McKinley puts her own spin on it.  What if Rosie grows up as a tomboy  in a small village? What if her fairy godmothers gave her skin like silk,  lips like rubies, and teeth like pearls--but forgot to to specify that she  should be pretty? And what if she has the ability to talk to animals? One  of the best things about this book is Rosie's beast-speech, in which cats  play riddle games, horses are romantics and foxes &quot;talk about  butterflies and grass and weather for a long time while they sized you  up&quot;.<br />If you already a Robin McKinley, then you already know that you  must read this book.  If you're not a fan, then you soon will be.	2000-08-04

I first read &quot;Missing Joseph&quot; back in 1996, and recently re-read it.  This is classic Elizabeth George--gore, sex and murder in a small town.  This story is unusual in that the reader always know  &quot;whodunnit&quot;; the question is why.  All of the characters--even  minor ones such as Josie--are well-drawn and fully fleshed out.  And the  dangling ends of the plot are tied neatly into a bow at the end.<br />Havers  doesn't play much of a role in this one.  The spotlight is shared by Lynley  and Simon St. James, with minor roles played by Deborah St. James and Lady  Helen Clyde.  The reader sees quite a bit of Lynley's troubled personal  life, including his relationship with Helen (I like the &quot;soap  opera&quot; aspects of the series), and gets a brief taste of Havers'  troubles in moving out on her own.  The Deborah/Simon sub-plot is  compelling.  It's hard to believe that these characters have all  experienced so much in fairly short lives (Simon's accident, Deborah's  affair with Lynley, etc.), but it makes for good reading.<br />All in all,  this is definitely worth reading--and re-reading!	2000-07-04

What if the Blitz was fought with dragons? What if tanks were replaced by behomoths, and motorcyles with  unicorns?<br />Good idea, but very poor execution.  The structure of the book  is a series of glimpses into the life of various characters, ranging from  farmers to generals.  Every time I became interested in a character, the  vignette was over, and the plot moved on.  There were too many  characters--over 15 &quot;viewpoint&quot; characters, and a host of  supporting characters!  This technique might have worked in a story set in  the &quot;real&quot; world, but I found it difficult to keep track of so  many characters and so many locations.  There were at least 10 factions or  nations involved in the war, as well as the ancient Kaunian Empire.  Enough  already!<br />This could have been a much stronger book if Mr. Turtledove had  focused on a smaller group of characters.  Good examples of a small group  of characters against a larger backdrop include Guy Gavriel Kay's  &quot;Tigana&quot; or Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;.  Mr.  Turtledove has a lot of ideas, but if he wants to sell books they must be  broken into more manageable pieces!	2000-07-04

I first read the most recent offering, &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot;, and I'm trying to complete the series.  Reading in reverse is very instructive--I can watch Ms.  Connor's development as a writer and the development of Lindsay Chamberlain  as a character.<br />&quot;A Rumor of Bones&quot; features an interesting plot  and an unusual heroine.  But this book feels somehow incomplete.  For one  thing, there are too many characters, and even the major people--Lindsay  herself, Derrick, etc.--feel like characters sketches instead of  fully-drawn individuals.  By removing a few minor characters, Ms. Connor  could have added much more depth to the story.  Lindsay is almost too  perfect--smart, beautiful, intelligent, resourceful, and possessed of  almost god-like abilities.  I found it difficult to feel much enthalpy for  her, or for most of the other characters.<br />All in all, this is a rough,  but promising, beginning to a new series.	2000-07-04

Like these other novels, &quot;The Way to Bright Star&quot; is an adolescent's journey through an America at war.  The people met along the  way are the book's greatest strength: soldiers, everyday farmers, a girl in  disguise.  The dialogue is great, and the settings evoke a time when our  county was truly the new frontier.<br />But the jumps from the Civil War era  to the early 19th century can be abrupt, and leave you with a sense of an  unfulfillment.  The ending in particular was very disappointing, both as  flashback and in the narration.  Is Mr. Brown planning to make this book a  series? If so, the ending will leave you hungry for more.  But if this is  all there is, you're in a for a disappointing letdown.	2000-05-09

I've been reading Elizabeth George since discovering a copy of &quot;Missing Joseph&quot; left in a laundromat in 1995.  Talk about wonderful chance discoveries! As soon as I could, I ran to the library and  checked out the rest of the series--and I wasn't disappointed.<br />Then came  the last several titles in this series--&quot;In the Presence of the  Enemy&quot; and &quot;Deception on His Mind&quot;.  Both books were good,  enjoyable reads--but something was missing.  The appeal of Ms. George's  books is the combination of great mystery and the growing  relationship/friendship between Lynley, Havers and the other people in  their world (Simon, Helen, etc.).  Maybe the missing element of the last  two titles was the lack of interaction between Lynley and Havers.  Havers  has become increasingly independent, to the point where Lynley barely  appeared in &quot;Deception on His Mind&quot;.<br />The Odd Couple are  reunited in &quot;In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner&quot;.  Havers has been  demoted due to the events at the climax of &quot;Deception&quot;, and  Lynley is relunctant to work with her again.  But the demands of the case  throw these unlikely allies together... In the final analysis, the mystery  takes a back seat to the interactions between the character, but I have no  complaints.<br />A supporting characters assumes a leading role in this  installment:  Winston (Winnie) Nkata.  Although Lynley is clearly the top  hunk in George's hierachy, Nkata must come a close second.  No one could  possibly replace Lynley and Havers, but I look forward to seeing much more  of young Winnie.<br />For Elizabeth George fans, this is a worthy addition to  a great series.  For George novices, this is a read not to be missed.	2000-02-10

Granted, I lack the basic criterion for being an expert on children's book--I'm 26 years old.  For old times' sake, I do try to stay current on what's new in children's book.  Compared to almost everything else I've  read, Ms. Rowling's Harry Potter series stands far ahead of the pack.<br />Ms.  Rowling takes a classic scenario in British children's  literature--adolescent children going to boarding school--and turns it on  its head.  Usually, all of the exciting stuff happens during school  holidays (as in C.S. Lewis' &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot; or Enid  Blyton's &quot;Five&quot; and &quot;Seven&quot; series).  In Harry Potter's  world, school holidays are spent among the &quot;Muggles&quot;--the  non-magical world--while school is where the magic really happens.<br />And  magic there is! From the wizardly sport of Quidditch to classes in potions  to a three-headed dog named Fluffy, Ms. Rowling throws in enough magic to  keep the interest of children (and adults) who don't usually like reading.  A sparkling plot, realistic (if you can imagine a magical world, then these  people belong in it) characters and a fully-realized world combine to  create a true gem of children's literature.  This one can easily share a  shelf with &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, &quot;Alice in  Wonderland&quot; and even &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.<br />Don't miss Harry Potter  and his adventures!	2000-01-31

She combines the best of two worlds--swashbucklers a la &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and high fantasy.  What a combination! And  &quot;The Death of the Necromancer&quot; doesn't disappoint.<br />In this  book, we return to Ile-Rien, approximately 100 years after the events of  &quot;The Element of Fire&quot;.  All the main character, Nicholas  Valiarde, wants is revenge on the man who framed his foster father.   Instead. he finds himself in the middle of a conspiracy of murder, magic  and mayhem.<br />An impressive and well-realized plot, a fantastically  realistic setting and great characters combine for a wonderful read.

Then I read the book cover and decided I had to check it out  of the library (sorry to the author and publisher, but I'm broke).  Family  history is a family hobby (inherited from my mother and grandmother,  ironically enough), and this is the kind of the book I've dreamed of  writing.<br />As usual, reality did not live up to expectation.  Although  there are a lot of good things about this book--I was impressed that not  all of the characters actually wanted to be free, a piece of realism (if  you doubt me, see &quot;The Slave Narratives&quot; or other first-person  accounts) often ignored.  The beginning was engrossing, but my interest  waned as the book went on.  For one thing, the story jumped from scene to  scene, without enough transition to make the leap worthwhile.  This may  have been a stylistic thing (the story tore the reader from a scene without  warning, as slaves were torn from their families), but it could have been  better executed.  I love happy endings, but this one felt like a  Movie-of-the-Week--one minute the Civil War is still going on, the next the  curtain falls on a happy reunion.  I hope Ms. Briscoe will keep writing  about her family--true stories bring history to life--but she needs to do a  little more work before releasing the next one.	2000-01-22

I've been a fan of Ms. Riley since &quot;A Vision of Light&quot; and have never been disappointed by her books.  &quot;The Master of All Desires&quot; is no exception.  It lacks the power and scope of &quot;The  Oracle Glass&quot;.  Somehow the characters are not quite as compelling and  the plot doesn't have the same suspense and immediacy.  But this is a great  read all the same, and I'd recommend it to both fans and JMR novices.  As  always, historical characters (Nostradamus, Catherine de Medici, Mary Queen  of Scots) wander in and out of the scene, adding to the fun.  I also enjoy  the hint of the supernatural in her books; Anael was a great addition to  this one!	1999-12-30

Abuse, violence and hopelessness fill the pages.  What was the author of the excellent &quot;Looking for the Mahdi&quot;  thinking?<br />The book begins well.  I'll give the title 4 stars, a literate  reference to the phenomenon that  nearly destroyed the world.  The premise  is interesting:  the earth loses its magnetic field, the ozone layer  disappears and the world turns into a broiling desert.  A few cities  survive under environmental domes.  The &quot;hero&quot;, Berk, is  searching for arable land and precious resources such as oil.  A promising  start, but then Berk loses his helicopter in the ruins of Philadelphia and  the story degenerates into violence and chaos.<br />Sadonya is at least an  interesting character, especially for her skills as a &quot;cook&quot;.   But she doesn't have any other redeeming characteristics.  True, she's a  product of her environment, but like Berk I found it impossible to like  her, and I was only marginally interested in her survival.<br />So much  violence, and much of it pointless.  Is Berk's rape of his wife really  necessary to carry the story along? And do we really have to know all the  details of the Rangers' torture of prisoners? <br />There were a few memorable  characters (I particularly liked Charon, which is why this book gets 3  stars instead of 2), the setting was wonderfully detailed and the writing  is up to Wood's usual high standard.  But in the end this is a bleak,  hopeless story.  I get enough of that out of the newspapers.	1999-09-18

I picked up this book at the library due to the interesting premise on the back cover:  a quadriplegic detective.  &quot;Cool,&quot; I thought, &quot;this is the ultimate armchair detective novel.&quot;  I still think  the gimmick is &quot;cool&quot;, but I was otherwise pretty disappointed by  this book.  I found Lincoln Rhyme's character almost believable, but I  couldn't identify with his female sidekick/protegee.  Why does she have to  be a beautiful ex-model (other than guaranteeing a large male audience for  the upcoming movie)? Also, everybody had a painful past--too many painful  pasts in one book (outside of Wuthering Heights).  The mystery itself was  interesting at first, but I found the end too pat.  I was also disappointed  by the too-neat tie-in to the next book.  Yes, I probably will read the  next book--I always want to know how things end up--but I'm checking it out  of the library instead of paying for it.	1999-05-21

I read 3 of Diana Gabaldon's 4 books; I enjoyed them as light reading but don't think I'll be wanting to read them again in  10 years.  I would rate this book in the same class.  I don't find it  surprising that Ms. Gabaldon has a review on the cover of the hard-cover  version; characters from her &quot;Outlander&quot; series even appear in  this book.  I'll give Ms. Donati high marks for an interesting and  intelligent heroine, but I would question some of her history:  if I'm not  mistaken, the school that Elizabeth runs is 30-40 years ahead of its time.	1999-02-11

I've never been a big fan of Roman history or culture; I always thought of them as highly  overrated.  Well, this series is changing my mind.  All of these books  completely immerse the reader in a world separated by ours by two millenia,  but I for one was amazed by how many things haven't changed.  I didn't  think this book was quite as good as the ones before, perhaps because I  didn't find Caesar as interesting as I did Sulla or Marius (I did read  McCullough's disclaimer about Caesar's intelligence, looks and physical  prowess, but I still find him a little too good to be true).  I'm currently  halfway through &quot;Caesar's Women&quot; and can't wait for  &quot;Caesar&quot;.	1999-02-11

Tempe Brennan isn't really a Kay  Scarpetta clone; she's an interesting character in her own right, with a  really interesting job.  And the plot was a compelling mystery.   Unfortunately, author Kathy Reichs undid some of her good work with  lectures about scientific and forensic procedure.  This book read like a  great thriller, interspersed with dry scientific lectures.  Perhaps because  I work in a scientific field, I found that Reichs tried too hard to explain  what her character was doing.  Hopefully, in her next work, she'll manage  to better blend the scientific with the mystery.  Still, this book is a  million times better than the last couple of Kay Scarpetta outings.	1998-10-17

After seeing this movie (which I enjoyed more for the special effects than  for the content), I kept hearing that the book was better.  So I bought it  and read it...and was ultimately disappointed.  Maybe I didn't find this  book as compelling as others did because I have always believed in an  Afterlife.  The breadth of Mr. Matheson's research was impressive, but I  did not find that the finished product had anything new to say.  I was  particularly bothered by the lack of God in this book.  Sure, the Almighty  was mentioned toward the end of the book, but I've always felt that God  would play more of a role in Heaven.  True, this is fiction, not theology,  but...	1998-10-17

I really enjoyed &quot;Archangel&quot; and was hoping for a similar experience with this book. As with most sequels, I was ultimately disappointed.  I enjoyed the return to Samaria, but I thought the plot and characters could have been much stronger.  Delilah and Alleya were caricatures instead of characters:  the stormy dark angel and the quiet blond.  Caleb was drawn a bit better, but Noah was also a cardboard cutout of a character.  I will give Ms. Shinn credit for finally resolving the mystery of what Jovah really is.	1998-06-16

I never read much cyberpunk before reading &quot;The Diamond Age&quot;; for this reason, I was somewhat leery of picking up this book, despite its many great recommendations.  What a great surprise! I was really impressed by Mr. Stephenson's ability to create the world of China and Atlantis-Shanghai.  The many storylines - Hackworth's search for the alchemist, Nell's growth and experiences with the primer, Miranda and Carl Hollywood, Judge Fang and Dr. X - were all engrossing.  The only problem I noticed was that the story got a bit weak toward the end.  Despite that, this book has turned me into a Neal Stephenson fan.  I've since read all of his other books and am anxiously awaiting the next.	1998-06-16
