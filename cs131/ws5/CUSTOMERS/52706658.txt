Particularly insightful are comments and insights the band members give after Joe's untimely death, and the knowledge of such imparts a poignancy to Gilbert's liquor-fueled interviews with Strummer.  But Gilbert has also tracked down the erstwhile Bernard Rhodes, the \\"complete control\\" genius/maniac who managed the Clash in their early days and then again as they broke up. His quotes are marvelously irreverent and mythic, and are a part of the Clash history often overlooked.<br /><br />As for the tale itself, Gilbert tells it with economy and precision (I think it's two-thirds the book that Gray's was), with lots of info even this diehard Clash aficionado was unaware of. Gilbert covers all the highs of the band--the knockout debut album that defined a generation and a whole new vocabulary of music and pop-culture style; the artistic triumph of \\"London Calling\\"; the outrageous intensity of their live shows; the conquering of America with \\"Rock the Casbah\\" and a Top 10 album... and then the fallout.<br /><br />Gilbert covers the last days of the Clash, including interviews with the usually forgotten members of Clash mark II, who seem unwilling to discuss it. It's an ignoble end to an often noble and great band, written out of Clash mythology--I don't blame them. But enough time has passed that we can see the problems involved, which Mick and Paul talk about more openly than in previous interviews.<br /><br />The book comes with a complete Clash discography as well as a bibliography, but one thing it lacks is a wealth of photos. There are a couple never-before-seen photos, but as Gilbert discusses, say, the changing look of the band (from Pop Art lettrism to black-and-white gangsters to military fatigues) some accompanying pics would've been nice. So, be sure to pick up Bob Gruen's peerless book of Clash photography, \\"The Clash,\\" which spans just about the entirety of their career.<br /><br />Clash PR man and confidant Kosmo Vinyl best sums up the inherent contradictions of the Clash this way: \\"We had so much fun robbing the bank, we forgot to take the money!\\"ack-and-white gangsters to military fatigues) some accompanying pics would've been nice.

This is just about the finest book there is on the almighty Clash, the only one that can really make you feel, if only for a white hot moment, that you're *there* while the band bashes out its masterpieces less than a dozen feet away, in some dank forgotten club a quarter century ago. You're so close for a second that you can read the phrases stenciled on Joe's military garb, count the zippers on Simmo's trousers, or feel the sweat from Jonesy's unshorn locks splashing on your face, not to mention the gob of a thousand punks flying over your head. And look who's in the crowd with you! Lester Bangs, Debbie Harry, Andy Warhol (altho' he's probably ligging about backstage), Martin Scorsese, that young ne'er-do-well of the NYC scene Harley Flanagan, even Johnny Thunders has stopped by on his way to cop.Man, could the Clash dress: from the Pollock-esque/Sex shop/Teddy/Rude boy of the early years, to the \\"collars-up mate\\"/perfect quiff & creepers days of 'London Calling,' to the quasi-military/cop fatigues of the final era. Check out the guys in an American supermarket, Joe counting out his \\"Yankee dollar\\"; or hanging out in Bob Gruen's NYC apartment watching NY Dolls' videos; or goofing off, in full rock leathers, at various airports round the globe. Really, please, and with all sincerity, can I go back and just *be* with those guys, come on, huh, please, just for a minute or two?But I can't, and you can't, and this book (along with Johnny Green's 'A Riot of Our Own' memoir) is the closest we're gonna get in these sore days. Bob Gruen's stunning, intimate, exhilirating photos over six years of the Clash's career are second to none, revealing them in all their raging glory. So open the book, grab a Guiness, blast the tunes, and relive the true punk era, and thank your lucky stars, bittersweet that they may be, that there was never any reunion. This is the best you're gonna get.	2003-07-19

Nor had I ever seen the famous film with Gregory Peck. Fortunately, I also avoided learning the entire plot through cultural osmosis. Sure, I knew who Boo Radley was-- didn't I? Atticus Finch... yeah, I know who that is... right?<br />Boy, was I wrong. Last week I finally decided it'd been long enough, and I sank into Harper Lee's only novel with high expectations. And I was certainly not disappointed. With its slow, warm and evocative opening chapters, Mockingbird starts off like a sulty summer day in the South. Lee depicts a South of \\"whistling bob white,\\" biscuits and warm milk, and ladies who on the hottest days bathe twice by noon and then douse themselves in lavender-smelling powder.<br />Jean-Louise Finch, better known as Scout, narrates the story with the keen eye of an adult looking back on a childhood rich with incidents that shaped who she has become. Scout reminded me of some of Carson McCullers's heroines (Member of the Wedding, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter), but without the morbid loneliness and heartbreak. Scout might be described as a tomboy, but that would be doing her a disservice. Her adventures with her older brother Jem, and their dimunitive friend Dill (real name: Charles Baker Harris. \\"Your name's longer'n you are,\\" Jem points out) evoke the timeless place of childhood.<br />As for Atticus Finch, what can one say about a father who seems to embody the greatest of virtues? He is tolerant, patient, kind, and understanding. He does not meddle with his children's affairs, he speaks to them as fellow adults (he allows them to call him \\"Atticus\\"), and his skill as a lawyer is legendary. Lee presents Atticus in a tough and sensitive manner, so that his believability is paramount.<br />The other characters in the book are also depicted with great skill: Aunt Alexandra, bane of Scout's existence; Miss Maudie, who gives as good as she gets when harassed by intolerant neighbors; Calpurnia, the ever-present black maid who has as much a hand in Jem and Scout's well-being as Atticus; and of course the Ewells, whose poverty and ignorance help set the plot in motion.<br />Harper Lee has written a wonderful book that pulses with life, with compassion, and easy good humor. Watching Atticus face down an angry mob set on lynching a black man, or racing with Jem as he escapes gunshots from the Radley house, or sitting with Scout as she forced to join her aunt's church lady reception, or taking that long midnight walk with Jem and Scout, is pure joy; these are scenes that reverberate in the reader's mind and surely in the minds of several generations of readers. I'm glad I can now say I'm one of them.rnia, the ever-present black maid who has as much a hand in Jem and Scout's well-being as Atticus; and of course the Ewells, whose poverty and ignorance help set the plot in motion.<br />Harper Lee has written a wonderful book that pulses with life, with compassion, and easy good humor.

Her face bears a camprichico smile, battered sunken eyes, a pulped nose. Cigarette burns stubble her breasts, one of which is still attached by only a gristle of meat. Beneath the rib cage, nothing. She is disassembled. Her second half begins above her pubic bone, her legs spread in a necrophiliac's wet dream pose, an open gash like an arrow pointing towards her vagina.  Her knees are broken and a triangle of flesh is missing from her left thigh.We can easily read the secrets she will never tell: days of unspeakable torture, and, in her portrait photos, of dreams deformed into horror. She is the Black Dahlia, a young woman named Elizabeth Short, and her murderer will never be found.James Ellroy's 1987 novel The Black Dahlia is the masterful crime writer's fictional account of this famous Hollywood murder case, complete with a wish-fulfilling conclusion. It's a relelentlessly intense pulp novel, bursting at the seams with violence, perversion, macho aggression (and weakness), and the gutter-glimmer of a Hollywood buried beneath nearly 60 years of history. Ellroy would begin his four-novel \\"Los Angeles Quartet\\" with this work (which actually pales in comparison with the following works: The Big Nowhere, LA Confidential, and White Jazz).Bucky Bleichert and Lee Blanchard, two young LA cops with ambition, haunted pasts, and a living woman between them. Each man becomes obsessed with the alluring Betty Short-- the images of her glamour photos in her tight black dresses and pale blue eyes as well as the gruesome images of the famous corpse she would come to be-- and finds his life in disarray because of it. All of the LAPD is on the case as the largest manhunt in the state's history gathers to find Betty Short's murderer-- but in the end only one man will be strong enough to handle-- or, indeed, care-- about the truth.Ellroy rubs our noses in the grit and the dirt of investigating the murder of a beautiful girl on the skids; as Bucky and Lee roust lowlifes in LA's warzones you can smell the cheap liquor, the stench of bum urine, feel the California heat as it shimmers on the blacktop, your bourbon hangover gripping your skull like a vice as you try to slice through inter-departmental bull, politics and the lies, to find out who killed a worthless two-bit beautiful piece of cheap Hollywood cooze. The atmosphere is heavy with neon, rain-slicked streets at night and reeking bachelor pads, sunlight filtered through venetian blinds, men and women frozen in a time we can only imagine as film noir. The dialogue is realistic and filled with the period slang of bebop jazz and cop-shop talk.The plot twists and turns, with a long jaunt to filthy Mexico graveyard, where Bucky literally digs up his past; to the early Hollywood machinations of (real-life) Keystone Kops director Mack Sennett and mobster Bugsy Siegel and Mickey Cohen. Lee Blanchard disappears, leaving Bucky to fend off three women: Kay Lake, who loved Lee; Madeliene Sprague, a Dahlia-lookalike; and the Black Dahlia herself, who even in death casts a spell over men.Ellroy ends his novel with the killer caught; the Black Dahlia's final hours revealed in gut-wrenching detail (\\"She bit on the gag and blood from where I took the Joe DiMaggio to her teeth came out due to her biting so hard. I stuck the knife down to a little bone I felt, then I twisted it\\"); one of the most famous of all unsolved murder mystery cases finally laid to rest. The climax is drawn out over the final thirty pages in a jagged wave of secrets uncovered and killers come forth. Ellroy gives you your money's worth, that's for sure.This novel is so dark it's virtually a horror novel; horror not in the sense of Stephen King but in the true sense of the word: awe at the depths to which humanity can sink and how it stains all our lives. Ellroy calls this book his \\"Valediction in Blood\\" and it's easy to see why: as a boy, his own mother was killed by an unknown man, and here in The Black Dahlia, he has solved one murder for another.

US	52706658	R1QJEZGSCEXE56	0446674370	280119482	The Big Nowhere	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Welcome to the Big Nowhere	Welcome to Los Angeles, CA, New Year's Day, 1950. The century's half-way point is marked by a grim discovery in West Hollywood: a male corpse, eyes torn out, body riddled with strange bite marks, genitals mauled. Deputy Danny Upshaw, not yet thirty, eager to prove his skill and talent as an LAPD detective, bribes a celebrity coroner so he can examine the body himself... and begins a case that will open a whole wide world of depravity, corruption, vengeance, and death. Happy New Year, and welcome to Hell.<br />Oh, yes, this is a James Ellroy novel. I can't imagine anyone familiar with contemporary literature not knowing his name, for James Ellroy single-handedly resuscitated the mystery-noir novel in the late-80s (and continues to astonish with his work in the late '90s). With his penchant for hipster -cop prose, extreme violence and gore, complicated and lengthy novels, and dozens upon dozens of characters, Ellroy upped the ante for what mystery novels could do and be. This is not escapist fiction--you will probably never encounter a world as dark and unrelenting, or as morally repugnant, as the one depicted in his so-called L. A. Quartet, of which The Big Nowhere is second.<br /><br />While not as gripping as White Jazz, nor as masterful as L. A. Confidential, Big Nowhere still manages to astound, shock, and satisfy the serious reader. With his spot-on recreation of 1950s Hollywood, Ellroy provides a unique glimpse into the evils of a period we still imagine to be fairly innocent. Ellroy spares no expense in Big Nowhere, kicking ass all over PC historical revisionism, going places with language, character and story that Chandler, Hammett, Cain, etc. would scarcely have dreamed.<br />Along with Det. Upshaw, there is Mal Considine, a DA assistant, still tortured by the fact the woman he once loved was a Nazi whore; her son means more to him than anything. To adopt this boy, he will join forces with paranoid, violent men with hard-ons for busting Commies in Hollywood. One of the most harrowing scenes in the novel is when he and Irish LAPD Lieutenant Dudley Smith--oh, evil, evil Dudley Smith, who appears in more than one Ellroy novel--interrogate a screenwriter and, in the end, force him to name his friends as Communist conspirators. Ellroy shades scenes like this not in a phony tone of black and white, but in those hellish, inescapable greys that damn us all.<br /><br />Then there's Buzz Meeks, an ex-cop who pimps underage girls to the infamous Howard Hughes, buys off judges, and does strong-arm work for Jewish mobster Mickey Cohen. Buzz is the hero of the novel, and that should give you another idea of what Ellroy's vision of conventional cops'n'robbers morality is. He'll eventually work with Considine and Smith, trying to uproot the perverted Communists at work in the movie industry--but he'll only do it for money.<br />You'll take a tour through black jazz joints, through junkie flophouses, medical examiner labs, through murder sites sprayed with blood, sit in on a art-snuff film, rub shoulders with incestuous men, femme fatales, and meet a killer who wears animal teeth. There are ugly secrets, double-crosses, set-ups; Upshaw goes deep undercover as a Leftist hep-cat and almost gets caught in a love-nest--but he's so tormented by his own sexual identity, he can't go through with what his job requires...<br />But by the last third of the book, things get really complex and confusing, and I found myself drifting. The explanation for everything comes in the final pages, and there is a very good climax, so stick with it. The Big Nowhere isn't Ellroy at his best, but that's still miles ahead of virtually every other crime writer out there.e of the most harrowing scenes in the novel is when he and Irish LAPD Lieutenant Dudley Smith--oh, evil, evil Dudley Smith, who appears in more than one Ellroy novel--interrogate a screenwriter and, in the end, force him to name his friends as Communist conspirators.

He didn't come as prophet or destroyer, not as a statesman or reformer, but as a guileless, unpretentious young man blessed with a talent and charisma and drive that leaves us mere mortals agape. In a way, he is like several other men of the era--Kennedy, Brando, Dean, later the Beatles--who created the &quot;youth culture&quot; to which we are (unfortunately) more enslaved to now than ever....<br />Wait a minute--did I just refer to Elvis as other than merely mortal? Not so, and Peter Guralnick's astonishing Careless Love finally makes it possible for us to grasp Elvis as human. While other books about him could fill a thousand mausoleums, let them, because Guralnick's two-volume set (the first is Last Train to Memphis (1994)), will stand as the definitive biography of this great American.<br />But before you dive in, let me say that Careless Love, while beautifully and carefully written, and extra-carefully researched--Guralnick had access to unorganized files in Graceland unlike anyone prior to him--it is dense with factual trivia insterspersed with the dramatic events of Elvis' life (and the lives of those around him). This book is not for the casual reader; in its intimate details, vast narrative, and utter lack of superhero worship glitter, this book will probably appeal less to traditional Elvis fanatics than to those seriously interested in this man who became a 20th century phenomenon.<br />Again and again, Elvis is described as &quot;humble, shy, respectful, hard-working.&quot; This seems true, right, but what is most effective in Guralnick's portrait is what's shown and not told--Elvis' misplaced affections, his desire to keep family and friends around him at all times (but then, you can't blame him). These people, from his father Vernon, to Priscilla, to old friends like Red West, had to put up with his mood swings, his anger, his jet-setting on a whim, the covert operations of smuggling girls in and out of his bedroom. Seemingly without concern for finances he gave away Cadillacs, motorcycles, TVs, homes, jewellry, to those around him, testing loyalty, wanting only their dedication to his perverse lifestyle.<br />Guralnick makes it clear that one of the young men in Elvis' employ became one of his most trusted friends--and one who was hounded out of the circle by Elvis' &quot;good ol' boy&quot; cronies. Larry Geller was a hairstylist when he met Elvis in April 1964. Immediately there was a rapport, for Geller filled a gap in Elvis' life--a hunger for spiritual, even intellectual pursuits. Geller listened while E poured his heart out about his mother--and if you know anything about Elvis, you know he loved his mother and when she died, well, he was never the same.<br />Elvis became quite the reader--one of the many revelations here. I won't comment on the types of religious books he read--well, suffice to say today they'd probably be shelved in the dreaded &quot;New Age&quot; section of bookstores, but who am I to say? Sometimes the critic in my head won't shut up--but it's obvious that E had found a bedrock for his life that he had not found in Col. Parker, in Priscilla, perhaps not even in his music. You really feel it when Guralnick describes how Elvis' friends (and let's not forget, they were his employees as well) start to openly mock Geller and his interests, and, by proxy, Elvis' interests as well, although they would never do so to his face. This part of Elvis they could never understand, a part that required a depth of feeling--and perhaps an ego--that these guys didn't have.<br />Some of my favorite parts of the book were when Elvis was in Vegas. Contrary to popular belief, Elvis turned in many great performances in Las Vegas. After spending years away from the stage, preoccupied with Priscilla, the baby, bad movies, etc., he was glad to concentrate on the music once again. Hehandpicked his backup band, and the performances highlighted his freewheeling, energetic, off-the-cuff personality that had been stifled. Guralnick excels in revealing how Elvis' confidence and enthusiasm returned at this point, and how he spent less and less time with Col. Parker. In these pages, Elvis comes across as simply wonderful.<br /><br />The best thing about this work is that it is simply about Elvis' life--indeed, it ends a mere page after detailing the funeral (50,000+ outside Graceland); James Brown gets a moment alone with the body; and Col. Parker tells a grieving Vernon Presley that even now they must think of the future (ooh, that conniving huckster bastard!) There is very little moralizing, even when it could be so easy: such as when Elvis wanted to have contracts put out on Mike Stone, whom Priscilla had had an affair with,and on his close friends Red and Sonny, who wrote the 1977 tell-all Elvis: What Happened?<br />No, what Guralnick gives us here is the portrait of a great man, a man whose legacy today is encrusted with gold and lacquer, a man who should be rediscovered and remembered as he is here: without myth, without ceremony, but with every respect and honor due him.handpicked his backup band, and the performances highlighted his freewheeling, energetic, off-the-cuff personality that had been stifled.

I'm sure many people who've seen his (actually, quite cutting and hilarious) show--Rotten Television-- on cable think he's just another pop culture character with a funny name without much to back it up. However, the truth is that Johnny Rotten presided over one of the single most exciting and influential moments in rock culture history. This \\"Rotten\\" persona is one of integrity and humor, and deep, biting sarcasm that, in the mid-70s, threatened to destroy the entire community of popular music. It was not a joke, and many, many people were frightened of him in a way that seems almost naive and quaint at this turn of the century.Published originally in hardcover in 1994, Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs (the sub-title is a reference to signs that hung in some public places in Britain in the 50s) is easily one of the best books on punk rock. I only recently acquired a copy of it, having read parts of it throughout the years but never from start to finish until now. I remember when it came out: I worked in a bookstore and only myself and another employee cared, and since we were in charge of displays were shoved aside the Clancys and the Steels and the Kings and put \\"Rotten\\" front and center. For several days Rots glared out at in-coming customers. We thought this was a good laugh.What makes \\"Rotten\\" so great is its rich, insightful, witty style. Whether describing his Dickensian childhood, the outrageous perversions of public schools, his misadventures with a young Sid Vicious, or the Great Rock'n'Roll Swindle itself, Lydon comes off as honest to a fault, with a sharp tongue (of course you knew that) and a sharp eye. His prickly Irish background is evident in his mania for the odd, gruesome little details that bring these stories to life. You really get a first-hand, in-depth look at the original punk movement. Lydon recalls the heady excitements, the furious disappointments, and the beatings with captivating style. There is no nostalgia here, for Lydon's persona will allow no such niceties, and the scene at the time was too intense for that to suffice nowadays.\\"Pop culture assassins\\" was how Malcolm McLaren saw the Sex Pistols, and it's quite apt. Despite the notorious conflicts between Lydon and McLaren, they did see (sort of) eye-to-eye on the ridiculous nature of music and celebrity as it was in the mid-70s. Diatribes against Elvis, Paul McCartney and the record company establishment itself abound. Story after story is recounted about the attempt by savvy teens at the time to create their own youth culture for themselves. Lydon describes perfectly the individuality, the fashion, the attitudes of early punks that he came to personify. I can't imagine the stamina and self-possession it must have taken for a 19-year-old to become one of the most lauded and vilified people of the day. To quote Rotten himself, \\"We mean it, maaan!\\" And he did: he meant every word. He knew he had the truth on his side. There is much fun to be had reading Rotten and lots to be learned. It reads at once as a sociological piece about youth cultures in Great Britain, and as a hilarious, sometimes scary, sometimes sad, yet always exciting and inspiring rock'n'roll autobiography. With sometimes slightly contradictory contributions from Steve Jones, Paul Cook, Chrissie Hynde, Billy Idol, Bob Gruen and others, it's not nearly as self-serving as you may think, for Lydon--as always--cuts out all ... and gives you a completely un-romanticized picture of true Punk Rock.rst-hand, in-depth look at the original punk movement.

With the loverly image of young Sue Catwoman gracing the cover (a cool parody of &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine), you know the publishers are appealing to those already in the know about UK punk. Brothers Nils and Ray Stevenson were chroniclers of this demi-monde, now over twenty years old, and in their words and pictures capture the era.<br />Color and b/w photos abound, with glorious portraits of all the guilty parties, from the usual suspects like Johnny R, Sid, Siouxsie, &amp; Poly Styrene, to the fringe characters like Debbie Wilson, Linda the dominatrix and Helen Wellington-Lloyd. Nils' diary entries start February 1976 and close August '80 (hanging out with the Banshees on a California beach). In between comes all the mayhem, the excitement, and the wonderful creative, anarchic energy that is true punk rock.<br />Look how young they all are! Sigh. It's amazing that these kids were between 16 and 20 years old and changed pop music so drastically. It's fun to read the contemporary handwritten comments written about those days by the folks involved. You just know that their lives were forever altered by these couple years.<br />There's a good intro that traces the roots of punk, from the mods and rockers of the sixties to the teddy boys of the early seventies to Malcolm's shop Sex. This book will go nicely on the shelf with &quot;England's Dreaming,&quot; &quot;Rotten,&quot; and &quot;Blank Generation.&quot; It's not for the casual fan of punk, but for the true fan.	2000-10-18

And doing that, he entertains the reader. &quot;Salem's Lot&quot; begins mysteriously but soon becomes a straightforward chiller, with plenty of comfortable characters, believable suspense, tragedy, and awesome horror.<br /><br /> The main characters--Ben Mears, Sue Norton, Mark Petrie, Matt Burke--are very well-drawn. Other townspeople, like the Glick family, Parkins Gillespie, the town constable, the tippling Father Flanagan, and seedy real estate agent Larry Crockett--are also drawn with simple skill and strength, making them as known to us as our own neighbors. We enjoy reading about their everyday pursuits--and are thus horrified by the horrible deaths they will come to.<br /><br /> Here, as in many of King's later works, are a many great insights into childhood--and adult--fears, whether rational or not. King can write about adultery and its repurcussions as well as bloodthirsty vampires, and make them both fascinating and convincing. He understands the writer's mind, the lives of the working class, and the pace of small-town life. Some of the best writing here is in the chapters entitled &quot;The Lot,&quot; in which he explores both the secret lives of many of the characters as well as the town itself... secrets that will eventually materialize into the forms of Straker and Barlow... and the innocent will suffer along with the guilty.<br /><br /> This book is one of the few that made me feel a physical fear, a dread the crept over me as I read. The writing is plain and this contributes to the general sense of mounting fear and unease. Perfect example: &quot;And all around them, the bestiality of the night arises on tenebrous wings. The vampire's time has come.&quot; Nice. Even this early in his published career, King really knows what he's doing.<br /><br /> I can't imagine any horror or Stephen King fan that *hasn't* read this book, but if you haven't, read it now, for it is a milestone in horror/vampire fiction.now, for it is a milestone in horror/vampire fiction.	2000-08-01

After more than a century it still has the power to shock,  startle and repulse. Precisely imagined, &quot;Maldoror&quot; is a fairly  obscure classic of late 19th century French literature, and is on par with  Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Verlaine, Mallarme, etc. You must read this if you  love those writers!<br />Maldoror is the narrator, and sometime character when  the narrative shifts unexpectedly into third person, and the alter ego of  the mysterious young Comte de Lautreamont--which was the pen name of  Isidore Ducasse. Dead by 24, he left behind this time-bomb. Maldoror is a  sadist, a murderer, a philosopher, an outcast from the normal order of  life. He encourages readers to kidnap a child and torture it, to taste its  tears and its blood--all within the first 30 pages. Right on! You are not  dealing with a rational, predictable mind here.<br />One of the book's most  fascinating aspects is its continuous imagery of animals, both everyday and  exotic, majestic and absurd: sharks, turkeys, crabs, eagles, octopi,  tigers, wovles, insects, serpents. These creatures are presented with the  sharp eye of the biologist. By likening humanity to animals, Lautreamont  achieves a double effect: man comes off as debased and at the same time,  elevated: to be like an animal man must be rid of all his pretensions and  vanities. It is this pretense to culture and civilized behavior that sicken  Lautreamont/Maldoror.<br />Many passsages still shock and disgust--and yes,  entertain with their feverish intensity, particularly the one in which  Maldoror copulates with a man-eating shark. A church lantern turns into an  angel, deteriorates into pus when Maldoror licks its face, and is soon only  &quot;an enormous loathsome wound.&quot;<br />Maldoror also despises  God--ostensibly the creator of all this human stupidity and vice. &quot;My  poetry shall consist of attacks, by all means, upon that wild beast, man,  and the Creator, who should never have begotten such vermin!&quot; When  Maldoror confronts God, Maldoror metamorphosizes into a giant octopus and  clamps his monstrous new tentacles around His body...<br />This anti-theistic  viewpoint is startling and refreshing compared to the religious aspects of  Rimbaud and Baudelaire. This work is a must-read for those interested in  avant-garde, bizarre literature; it is also the springboard for Surrealism  (with the passage, &quot;As beautiful as the chance meeting on a dissecting  table of a sewing maching and an umbrella,&quot; Andre Breton saw the  future of his imagination). This edition contains a good introduction about  the work itself, its language, what &quot;Lautreamont&quot; means, earlier  mistranslations, etc. Lykiard's translation is fantastic.

Finally, Howard Phillips Lovecraft seems to be getting some due from the straight literary world. First it was that long Joyce Carol Oates essay in the NY Review of Books, than it was the \\"Annotated Lovecraft\\" updates from Ballantine/Del Rey, and  now Penguin Classics has seen fit to bestow the mainstream American reading  public with this quality paperback. Wow, I can't imagine what readers of  Virginia Woolf, Jack Kerouac, John Steinbeck and T.S. Eliot will do when confronted with  the likes of Yog Sothoth, the Goat with a Thousand Young, The Great Old  Ones and that nasty ol' Cthulhu....<br />Seriously: this stuff is  incomparable. Lovecraft's creation of the Cthulhu Mythos (or, as he called  it, \\"Yog-Sothothory\\") heralded a new age in supernatural fiction.  So vivid, so cosmic, so vast and imaginative, it is the equal of Middle  Earth, of Oz or Wonderland. HPL's view of humanity and the cosmos is  deeply, darkly existential, almost nihilistic, and he used symbolic  structures of his neuroses to portray that view.<br />As for the stories themselves, the cornerstones are \\"The Call of  Cthulhu\\" (1926)and \\"The Color Out of Space\\" (1927); they will still be read a  hundred years from now for their controlled atmosphere of cosmic dread and  awe. His skill at evoking a slowly dawning sense of terror is unparalleled in these tales. \\"The Shadow Over Innsmouth\\" (1931)--not too shabbily adapted in a 2002 film as \\"Dagon\\"--and \\"The Shadow Out of  Time\\" (1934) rank next, later stories that are a bit wordy but still  powerful, unsettling, and unforgettable. Man's place in the cosmos is revealed as paltry and incosequential; his physical being rendered as mutated and degraded. Space and time become meaningless. These latter two stories contain my favorite climaxes; the chill will remain with you for ages. Others in this collection include \\"Rats in the Walls,\\" \\"The Outsider\\" and \\"The Hound.\\" The latter two reveal his penchant for evoking Poe all too derivatively (although the erstwhile Poppy Z. Brite wrote a reverent Goth-punk update of \\"The Hound,\\" \\"And His Mouth Will Taste of Wormwood\\"); the former is one of his best early works.<br />H.P. Lovecraft forced horror and supernatural fiction out of its old world infancy of vampires, ghosts, and devils and into the adult, modern world of a  cold, uncaring, nearly malicious universe that we can scarcely comprehend.  While Lovecraft's prose at times leaves much to be desired, the power of his imaginings is unique and convincing. This collection belongs on the bookshelf of serious readers everywhere. S.T. Joshi is a marvelous editor and biographer of Lovecraft, and his efforts  should not go unheeded. Kudos to Penguin for finally adding H.P. Lovecraft to  their catalog of Twentieth Century Classics.rstwhile Poppy Z.

My favorite title of recent memory, \\"The Naked and the Undead\\" (a play on Mailer's WWII classic \\"The Naked and the Dead\\") is a much-needed review of recent horror films. Too many books on this topic are sadly out of date, incomplete, condescending, or just plain wrong. Philosophy professor Cynthia Freeland, however, dives right into the thick of things, stating that her favorite director is auteur David Cronenberg and that she has little patience for mainstream schlock like Freddy and Jason. \\"All right,\\" I thought to myself, \\"my kind of writer.\\"<br />She covers the entire \\"Hellraiser\\" series, the most recent vampire films, and classics like \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre,\\" \\"Repulsion,\\" \\"Them!\\" \\"Eraserhead,\\" \\"Peeping Tom\\" and \\"Nosferatu.\\" The chapters range from \\"Women and Bugs\\" (the Alien and Species films) to \\"Monstrous Flesh\\" and \\"The Slasher's Blood Lust.\\" Freeland knows her stuff, and her insights are profound and interesting. She considers feminist images in contemporary horror, graphic violence and its impression upon viewers, the appeal of the seductive, aesthetic vampire, and the visionary, intellectual works of Cronenberg (\\"Videodrome,\\" \\"Dead Ringers,\\" \\"The Fly\\").<br />The major problem, however, is that she's an academic, and the book reads like a PhD. dissertation. It's not a lot of fun to read, like, say, Stephen King's \\"Danse Macabre\\" or Kim Newman's \\"Nightmare Movies\\" or the anthology \\"Cut!\\" If you're a serious reader as well as horror film buff, then this book is very worthwhile. If you've ever studied film in college this book will be right up your alley. If, however, you don't really call into either category, then this book probably isn't for you.<br />There is much to be learned from in this book, and I'm very glad Ms. Freeland took such care and patience. I only wish she had approached this book more as an intelligent fan rather than as an academic. So, 3 and a half stars. And kudos for the awesome cover art!	2000-05-26

Georges Bataille often falls between the cracks of literary identificaton because his work straddles so many uncomfortable realms. A sometime-Surrealist who had a falling out with Andre Breton, Bataille's  books are often compared to the Marquis de Sade's. Reading &quot;Story of  the Eye&quot; it's not hard to see why: two teenage lovers experiment with  their bodies and with foreign objects; eventually their erotic adventures  include madness, torture, murder and the death of a bullfighter.<br />This is  strange, heady stuff--fortunately the book is barely 100 pages long. This  is underground literature at its finest, mocking the pretensions of  culture, of decency, morality, and healthy sexuality. Bataille's style can  be obtuse but can also illuminate dark, forbidden corners of humanity. If  you're into de Sade, Wm. Burroughs, Surrealism, Clive Barker, the  psychology of fetishism, or just want something to read that is light years  from the crappy bestseller lists, read &quot;The Story of the Eye&quot; and  introduce yourself to the unholy world of Georges Bataille.	2000-05-06

How much more can be said about Sid Vicious, the Sex Pistols, and 70s punk in general? Well, it helps if you've got stories nobody's heard before, and &quot;Sid Vicious: Rock'n'Roll Star&quot; (God, I hope there's some irony intended in that subtitle) has them. I won't reveal them here, but I will  say I've been a punk fan for a long time (I'm not telling!) and I learned a  lot here--lots of little details really make Sid come alive in a new way.  Sure, he was nasty and brutish, and his life was short, but he's still  entertaining. There are also fantastic pictures, again, many which I was  unfamiliar with. There's a funny one of him in the hospital after the  break-up of the Pistols, and lots of good ones before he ever joined the  band.<br />This book covers his whole life--his childhood with his  drug-friendly mother, his teen years as an art student (but then, name me  one British rock star that DIDN'T go to art school!)--and the hellish  descent his life took after January 14, 1978. It's all here--great writing  (the bibliography includes &quot;England's Dreaming&quot; and &quot;12 Days  on the Road&quot;), hilarious and chilling anecdotes, unparalleled photos,  and good research. However, it did leave out a really cool fact--that Sid  got his trademark padlock necklace from Chrissie Hynde. But it does reveal  that the one Gary Oldman wore in &quot;Sid &amp; Nancy&quot; was, in fact,  that very one.<br />This slim book doesn't look like much at first glance, but  appearances deceive. Avoid at all costs, however, the much more hyped  &quot;El Sid&quot; by David Dalton--a wretched, exploitative, cheap and  poorly written work with no photos and imaginary diary entries from Sid.  CRRRAAPPP!<br />PS: &quot;Sid Vicious: Rock'n'Roll Star&quot; would make an  EXCELLENT gift for that bratty 14-year-old nephew of yours who thinks  Rancid and Green Day and Blink 182 are &quot;punk rock&quot;--show him the  guy who walked it like he talked it, and paid the highest price for  it.<br />&quot;Regrets...

Dostoevsky, that great tortured and feverish soul, wrote this novel after the onslaught of the Nihilists in Russian arts and letters. He felt he was waging a war against the crude and unfeeling Western materialism of the  day; he was battling what he saw as a holy war. While authors like Turgenev  and Tolstoy regarded the expanding West with (fairly) open arms, Dostoevsky  feared it would cause a religious crisis, where faith in Christ was  extinguished and ignorance, vanity, and greed would overcome.<br />This is a  towering, exciting novel--perhaps not as great as &quot;Crime &amp;  Punishment&quot; or &quot;Brothers Karamazov&quot;--it contains some of his  most penetrating insights into religious faith, human compassion, despair,  and insanity. Prince Myshkin is of course one of literature's great  characters, a Christ-like young man caught up in the treachery of the  aristocratic lives of the Yepanchins. The other two main characters,  Rogozhin and Nastasya Filippovna, along with Myshkin, form a powerful  triangle that, despite their being &quot;off-stage&quot; for much of the  novel, drive this novel to its tragic, unavoidable climax.<br />I do not,  however, recommend this book to first time Dostoevsky readers; that should  be &quot;Notes from Underground&quot; or &quot;Crime and Punishment.&quot;  The ideas Dostoevsky explores here need some context and understanding;  they may leave the inexperienced reader a bit confused. At least that was  my experience! After understanding him and his concerns, this novel cracked  wide open. It is a darkly spiritual work, as are all of his; it is also  quite disturbing. When young Ippolit describes the Hans Holbein painting  &quot;Christ in the Tomb&quot; that adorns the cover of the Oxford edition,  we see into the darkest reaches of despair and hopelessness. Indeed, the  painting is a Christ that is unresurrected, one that is rotting flesh and  cannot, in Dostoevsky's scenario, save humankind. This thought terrifies  Rogozhin, Myshkin... and Dostoevsky himself.<br />What a stunning achievement  this work is. I am in awe of it.

Jean-Paul Sartre is a giant of 20th century literature, and his philosophy of existentialism is, along with surrealism, the most important idea of our age. Many people think they know what existentialism means, as I did before  I read this work. My half-formed ideas were clarified, misunderstandings  sorted out; I found much to think about here. I recommend this because the  essays are succint, clear, penetrating: &quot;Man is condemned to be  free... because, once thrown into the world, he is responsible for  everything he does.&quot; I myself found this book liberating, a challenge  to my intellect but not a dreary, endless tract (as &quot;Being and  Nothingness&quot; strikes me!) I found much to underline and comment on in  my copy. There is much courage in existentialism; and there is much to be  learned from this short work.	2000-03-17

Loved it then, like it now. I must've reread it a dozen times, because the characters caught hold of me. King sketches his characters broadly but  carefully, making their dialogue come alive--Jud Crandall is particularly  likeable in this regard--and making their emotions ring true... Which is  what makes the horror so unsettling. This is one of King's darkest works,  as it deals not simply with supernatural terror, but REAL terror, like the  death of a child, or the realization that people can be cruel and evil with  little provocation, or the guilt that comes with hiding things. One of the  effective ways King achieves his horror is in having Jud Crandall tell his  stories about what happened many years before in the town of Ludlow. God,  those stories, of Timmy Baterman, of Jud's own dog, wreaked havoc on my  imagination as a teen; one of the very few times that simply reading has  induced in me the feeling of physical fear, as if I myself might be in  danger. I've read countless horror novels, and this was one of the few  books to do that to me! It's not really fun. Still, I recommend &quot;Pet  Sematary&quot; highly. It's dark and somber and very real--King playing for  keeps.	2000-02-25

David Cronenberg--what do we do with him? Is he a horror filmmaker? A Canadian who makes art films? A schlockmeister? Cronenberg bucks all categories and trends because so many of his films cannot be placed in any  genre. You'll not find any tough-talking hipsters a la &quot;Pulp  Fiction&quot;; you'll find no romantic cliches a la &quot;Chasing  Amy&quot;; you'll find no staid, genteel period pieces a la Merchant-Ivory.  With Cronenberg what you get is sui generis, an auteur in the true sense of  the word, a man whose perverse, atheistic, disturbing visions are realized  on-screen in a wholly uncompromising manner. In this book of interviews you  get to hear this brilliant, highly articulate man talk about his films,  production, story ideas, influences (Burroughs &amp; Nabokov, how about  that!), diseases and viruses, social mores, the responsibiblities of the  artist, and more. Personally I find Cronenberg a more interesting thinker  than other filmmakers, even ones I like a bit better (Woody Allen,  Scorsese), because he's primarily an intellectual who is not afraid to look  at the non-human aspect of his films--the insect, the parasite, the video  image--and postulate its unique existence. Recent films like  &quot;Crash&quot; and &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; are difficult, rewarding  works, although I know many people who hate these films. Film fans are  notoriously divided on where Cronenberg stands--some called  &quot;eXistenZ&quot; a wooden bore, others one of the great SF films of  recent years. Some say &quot;Videodrome&quot; is a mashmash of half-thought  ideas, or that &quot;Crash&quot; is pretentious and ridiculous. Some men  can't watch &quot;Dead Ringers,&quot; while many film critics consider it  Jeremy Irons' greatest performance. I think these films are oddly brilliant  and exciting. And I'd rather watch a mediocre Cronenberg film than just  about any independent or Hollywood film--Cronenberg always gives you  something to think about.

There are few words to describe this towering achievement: Magnificent. Chilling. Overwhelming. Ferocious. Intense. Uplifting. Dostoevsky's masterpiece, published just months before his death, is the single greatest  book I have ever read. Every book I'd encountered is just a pale shadow of  this one, for it contains everything the human heart holds dear. What I  truly love about this book is its depiction of human suffering and  evil--why, even the Devil himself makes an appearance, as an old Frenchman  who engages atheist Karamazov brother Ivan in a philosophical discussion.  The Devil takes the old Latin phrase, \\"I am human, therefore nothing  human is alien to me\\" and changes it to: \\"I am Satan, therefore  nothing human is alien to me.\\" My blood runs cold at the  perfection of that. And Ivan himself says to his young Christian brother  Alyosha: \\"I believe that if the Devil exists, man created him in his  own image.\\" These are some of the truest, most profound words ever  spoken.<br /><br />But the story! Oh, what a tangled, complex, gripping tale we  have of murder, jealousy, lust, anger, and guilt! Dostoevsky knew how to  spin a murder mystery, that's for sure. The genius of this book (and many  of Dostoevksy's) is that it is utterly contemporary--its intensity  translates well to today's world; in many ways the violence and  psychological torment here is comparable to a Martin Scorsese film (the  filmmaker has indeed invoked the great writer's name on several occasions).  While I was reading this book, the OJ Simpson trial was in full force, and  it paralleled the book's penultimate chapters in the Russian courts. All of  Russian society was there, and fascinated by what the murder of Fyodor  Karamazov, the father, said about Russia at the turn of the century. This  is precisely what America went through during that trial in  1995--Dostoevsky's book, written over 100 years before, perfectly captured  our world today. I was stunned, and what seemed like a ridiculous media  circus became fraught with meaning, illuminated by \\"The Brothers  Karamazov.\\" Who ever would've thought?<br /><br />Read this book. Read it.  It is what every work of literature wants to be... but can't quite make it.ulous media  circus became fraught with meaning, illuminated by \\"The Brothers  Karamazov.\\" Who ever would've thought?<br /><br />Read this book.

A beautifully illustrated work of witty, perceptive and wide-ranging scholarship, Turner presents a multi-faceted Hell that one can't help but be drawn to. The chapters are fairly short and readable--this is no heavy,  dry academic tome, although you'd have to be a complete bore to make this  subject anything less than fascinating--at least for me. There's not much  of hell at all in the Bible; most of our perceptions of hell were indeed  formed by Milton and Dante and other works outside the Christian biblical  canon. Turner concentrates on how images of the infernal place have changed  over centuries, and how our philosophies of what is human, what is good,  etc. change and adapt. She's a sharp, insightful writer, although I suspect  her sometimes irreverent, agnostic tone may turn off some readers. I could  be wrong though! I recommend this along with Jeffrey Burton Russell's  &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; (perhaps the single best book on the Devil  himself, from 1988); Paul Carus' &quot;The Devil&quot;; and Lauren Paine's  &quot;The Hierarchy of Hell.&quot; Together these books are a long gaze  into the abyss....	2000-02-17

What a marvelous  way of writing history--we see how the outrageous stories collide and  intersect; we get to &quot;hear&quot; the youthful energy and enthusiasm  first-hand; we gain fresh insights into folks we thought we'd learned all  about years ago. People like Joey Ramone and Iggy Pop are, of course,  heroes to me--to see them brought to such life here as real people is an  absolute joy. I got to meet Legs and Gillian on their tour for the book  several years ago and they are the epitome of COOL, as are the people in  this book. Pix are good too, I especially dig the one of Johnny Thunders,  Richard Hell and Sid Vicious out on bail. Poor kid. I don't care if the  majority of music listeners don't know who these folks are--rock'n'roll  wouldn've died out years ago if it hadn't been for their reckless,  drug-fueled ferocity and their maniacal genius raw power. Buy this and  &quot;England's Dreaming&quot; and that's punk baby! LAMF Forever!	2000-02-17

An amazing, fascinating, intellectually stimulating book on a subject too often the province of cranks, fanatics, or frauds--the Devil himself. Russell, a California history professor, has written several volumes on  Lucifer, and this is the most far-ranging. An in-depth study that traces  the history of the Devil from his shadowy origins in the desert wastes of  the Middle East and of course even further back, in Africa; follows him  through Judaism and early Christianity to the Middle Ages, up through the  Reformation and Age of Enlightenment, right through to the Holocaust and  the post-modern world. Russell explores theology, folklore, literature, and  history to piece together this ultimate symbol of evil. From early church  writers such as Origen and Tertullian to Milton and Dante, to Baudelaire,  de Sade, Dostoevski and Flannery O'Connor, Russell looks at the ways in  which the Devil has been personified for different ages. Highly readable,  packed with accurate and well-researched information, this should appeal to  anyone with an interest in comparative religions, mythology, or history.  This really is perhaps the definitive book on the figure of the Devil,  although I would also recommend Paul Carus' &quot;The Devil and the Idea of  Evil,&quot; Alice Turner's &quot;The History of Hell&quot; and Homer  Smith's &quot;Man and His Gods.&quot;	2000-02-16

What a marvelous book. If you're like me, and have been a Bettie fan for years, you've been waiting for this book. For years one could find stuff on her only in comic shops and the  like, dealing in old memorabilia from the Fifties, or in various  &quot;alternative&quot; shops that sold her image on T shirts. As a teen  that's where I learned about her, thanks to &quot;The Rocketeer,&quot; the  comic &quot;The Bettie Pages,&quot; and psychobilly trash-punk band the  Cramps, who for a short time had a bass player the spittin' image of our  fair maiden. Now that we've finally opened our eyes, we can buy several  books on her, this being by far the best. It is the ne plus ultra of  Bettiebooks, of pin-up books in general. What a trend-setter; a humble,  troubled, open and honest woman who was not exploited, who has not turned  herself into a PC victim--she's idolized by smart, hip young women who see  in her freedom, sexuality, playfullness, life itself. This book had better  be reprinted--it's an absolute crime to be unavailable. Get this book by  any means necessary!	2000-02-11

A fantastic book that effortlessly examines complex matters such as artistic creation, space exploration, future technology and its impact on human societies, global tensions, serial murder and consciousness itself.  Bear's genius is to link several stories thematically--particularly  striking is the way a psychologist's exploration into the mind of a mass  murderer parallels an artificially intelligent space probe's exploration of  an uninhabited planet. Populated by strong and interesting characters (such  as the murderer Emmanuel Goldsmith, a black poet; Martin Burke, the  psychologist who uses nanotechnology to delve into &quot;The Country of the  Mind&quot;; as well as detective Mary Choy, an Asian genetically altered to  appear African American), Bear uses a variety of styles to tell his tale.  There is awe and terror and desire here; insights into the nature and  origins of evil, of the human need for justice, and the urge to travel far  from Earth. The complex and at times experimental structure of the novel  may turn off some readers, and I initially found it difficult to follow.  Once the book had me in its spell, however, I was lost without it. This is  my first Greg Bear novel, and it is certainly not my last. My highest  recommendations.	2000-01-31

This all may be true, but to dismiss it as such is to miss a vital element of rock'n'roll. 'England's Dreaming: Anarchy, Sex Pistols, Punk Rock and Beyond' stands as the best book on its subject, and as one of the finest books on the sociology of music in general.<br />Jon Savage was prescient enough to have kept his teenage journal from those long-ago days of London in the mid-to-late-70s, he is able to present us with a thorough, first-hand account to spice up his in-depth journalism. Throughout this work he quotes from it, giving us impressionistic, colorful glimpses of the time:<br />\\"30.10.76: I go see my first proper punk group. I know what it's going to be like: I've been waiting for years, and this year most of all: something to match the explosions in my head. The group are called the Clash; everybody I talk to says they're the best.... Within ten seconds I'm transfixed; within thirty, changed forever.<br />23.11.76...fascism here won't be like in Germany. It'll be English: ratty, mean, pinched, hand in glove with Thatcher as mother sadist over all her whimpering public schoolboys.<br />25.12.76: A party... in the kitchen downstairs, members of the Damned, the Clash and the Sex Pistols sit around a large table.... Halfway through the evening, the Heartbreakers arrive, and install themselves in a tight corner near the telephone, which Johnny Thunders uses to make hour-long calls to the US. Not collect.<br />25.12.78: Public Image Ltd, Rainbow Theatre, London. this, as expected, is mainly Rotten's show. Except now there is a new element of whining and self-justification....\\"<br />Savage goes so much deeper than just his own observations, deeper than any writer on British punk ever has or ever probably will. First he examines the British pop/youth cultural movements after World War 2, like the Mods and the skins and the Teddy Boys, before coming to that little shop at 430 King's Road. We get some myth-destroying insights into the origins of Malcolm McLaren's relationships with the burgeoning Sex Pistols; namely, that it originally was 18-year-old guitarist Steve Jones' band. Savage debunks the notion that the Pistols were--as is the common, popular perception today--the *NSync of their day. McLaren was great at hindsight, saying \\"Oh, I meant that to happen\\" when really it was all out of control. Quite a bit of the book deals with the utter contempt and frustration with which Johnny Rotten and later Sid Vicious felt towards this Fagin-esque character.<br />Savage also looks the punk scene in surrounding towns, such as the Buzzcocks in Manchester; the difficulty in getting clubs to book the bands; the sudden liberation (but not quite) young women felt, resulting in \\"stars\\" such as Siouxsie Sioux, Poly Styrene, and the Slits; the (sometimes fake, sometimes real) competition between the Pistols and their rivals the Clash; the utterly disastrous tour of southern American states by the Pistols; the fashion, the art, the impact the movement had on the rigidly structured British class system. His account of the Jubilee summer (1977 was the 25th year of Queen Elizabeth's reign), and the attendant boat ride up the Thames--the Sex Pistols performed \\"God Save the Queen,\\" their inflammatory anti-royalty statement just as the boat passed Parliament--makes you realize that Punk gave a new meaning to \\"civil disobedience.\\"<br />The self-immolation of the notoriously doomed Sid Vicious (and McLaren's ultimate exploitation of it) is dealt with by Savage tenderly:<br />\\"What happened next will always be a blur. In an account given by Vicious shortly before his death, he woke up from a Tuinol stupor in the light of the morning to find a trail of blood leading from a soaked bed to the bathroom.... he found Nancy lying under the sink with a hunting knife sticking in her side... Vicious went into complete shock--from which he would barely recover for the rest of his life. As the realization of what had occurred sank in, he panicked totally: the only person had ever cared for him was dead, by his knife, and he couldn't remember a thing.\\"<br />Whew.<br />Another interesting aspect of the book are the analogies made between Punk--Savage capitalizes the word--and the major art movements of the 20th century. Sometimes this comes off as intellectual puffery, and yet in my thoughtful moments I think Savage is quite right to link McLaren's ideas with Dada, Surrealism, and Situationism. Rotten is compared to the young Rimbaud; the Clash wore Army fatigues splattered with colored paint a la Jackson Pollock; Subway Sect and other bands created music that seemed defiantly anti-music; and one cannot deny the primitive, art brut beauty of Xeroxed 'zines like Snffin' Glue, the flyers and the record sleeves.<br />Now more than ever punk is my favorite music--'70s punk, let me clarify--the Clash, the Pistols, the Buzzcocks, etc. just don't ever seem to lose their edge or their aura of chaos narrowly avoided. England's Dreaming: Anarchy, Sex Pistols, Punk Rock and Beyond is, ultimately, an inspiring testament to the creative powers of oppressed youth everywhere--may that flame never die.<br />Contrary to what the Pistols said, there IS a future: you just have to know how to throttle it with your bare hands....Rrrrrright--Now!ting knife sticking in her side...

This is probably the second or third Barker collection I came across, way back in 1987. I was a high school kid, immersed in King, Straub, Lovecraft, Koontz, but Barker was a writer I had to think about, someone whose writing  style aimed above the usual 6th grade average. His images were unsettling  and confusing--I remember coming to the end of the title story and  thinking, &quot;Wwwhaaat?&quot; but that was so long ago. I credit Barker  with making me a more discerning, sophisticated reader. Horror could be  sharp with wit, laced with the blackest comedy, and subversive like the  punk rock music I loved. He approached topics like sexuality and psychology  unlike any other writer I had ever read. This book, Volume 5 of &quot;The  Books of Blood,&quot; is one of the very strongest. He toys with religious  fanaticism and fundamentalism in &quot;Revelations,&quot; with the Devil in  the modern world in the fable &quot;Down, Satan!&quot; and with eros and  extreme arousal in &quot;The Age of Desire,&quot; one of my favorite  stories by him. This was one that I would retell to my shocked friends at  lunch. They wanted to be weird, to be outcast, but Ha! they weren't willing  to go all the way. Barker, he goes all the way. He is, along with Harlan  Ellison and Lovecraft himself, the only writer of any type of fiction, that  I can reread now, over a decade later, with satisfaction and awe and  respect. Clive Barker. Make no mistake.	1999-07-08

A much-needed, carefully researched book that looks into the darkest of cinematic shadows. I especially like that they debunk the snuff film industry.

For some reason I put off reading this book for years, and not until recently did I get around to it. I loved the movie--but the book, good God man! You have to be careful not to get  papercuts and bleed all over the pages you turn 'em so fast (although I  think that'd be appropriate for this one). I'm glad Vincennes' character  was explored more in the book (note: the one instance where the film  outdoes the novel is in the case of Vincennes' death--those who've seen the  movie know what I mean). I couldn't believe that &quot;Black Dahlia&quot;  or &quot;White Jazz&quot; could be topped, but &quot;LA&quot; does it.  Ellroy explores nearly every filthy depraved activity a person can do--from  drug addiction and alcoholism to extortion, racism, murder, snuff porn  (blech), incest, and random beatings. This is all the stuff Chandler, Cain,  et. al.  could only hint at. All that stuff with Dieterling/Disney was so  over the top it was genius! The movie couldn't even hint at the darkest  crime that is the heart of the book, so it was dropped altogether-- it's  more &quot;horror&quot; than anything Stephen King could ever come up with!

I read this book in one day, I just could not get enough of its personal, unpretentious and colorful tone. Johnny Green has written a sly, thoughtful, and very sharp memoir of his days with the almighty Clash.  Here one actually sees the courage and stamina and wit it took to be a punk  rock band in the 70s--Green writes vividly of the police troubles, the  riots and the madness (and poverty) of life on the road. He also does a  great job of sketching the personalities of the Clash men: Strummer comes  off the best, with his man-on-the-street persona, his gentle whisper in  conversation, his concern for his downtrodden fans, and his insatiable  interest in life around him. Jones is the prima donna, a &quot;muso&quot;  with a definite vision for his band, fueled by coke, pot and women. Simonon  is the sharp, funny, beautiful one, very cool. Topper's spiral into drug  abuse begins near the book's end--he's the guy that just goes along, but  Green always seems impressed by his talent. We see here how The Clash were  truly trailblazers; albums like &quot;London Calling&quot; and &quot;Give  'em Enough Rope&quot; are among the finest British rock'n'roll ever  recorded. I love this book, found it more insightful than the recent bio,  &quot;Last Gang in Town&quot;; the Clash finally became real people to me,  involved with the real world and people of all types. The Clash still  remain, for me, the Only Band That Matters. Thanks to Johnny Green for  putting his story to paper! (and after all this, won't you give me a  smile???)	1999-02-11

Clive Barker, the multi-talented Liverpudlian, supposedly was to be \\"the future of horror\\" (so said no less an authority than Stephen King) with the release of these first three \\"Books of Blood\\" way back in 1984. Turned out, however, that with his  finely-honed pen, his gift for odd details, locales, and the powerful image, his penchant for mordant wit, the ambiguity with which he infused his stories (are there ever  clear demarcations between those hoary old cliches Good & Evil in these  tales?) and the sheer glee he took in subverting the genre turned off readers looking for a slice of American Gothic, a la Anne Dean Koontz, John Saul, and even King himself.<br />I say, leave those authors for the housewives and dilettantes; Barker  is the real thing, a writer whose work doesn't comfort, but disturbs. How could readers looking for the traditional horror  fiction formula react to stories like \\"In the Hills, the Cities,\\" \\"Sex, Death, & Starshine,\\" or \\"The Last Will & Testament of Jacqueline Ess\\"? He doesn't want to frighten you so much as radically alter your perception of the world. The horror genre is too often reactionary as it tries to banish the monster, the alien, the seemingly terrifying. Barker wants transformation; his characters confront the darkness, and find themselves changed, often times for the better, when they embrace it (literally, in the climax of \\"Jacqueline Ess\\").<br />Rather than recommend this to conventional horror fans, I say readers who like to challenge  themselves should check these out--perhaps readers of Martin Amis or Julian  Barnes or Jeanette Winterson, or Jorge Luis Borges, or Italo Calvino. Then  again, maybe I'm wrong--Barker's work is graphically blood-drenched, which  gained him a reputation in the mid-80s as a splatterpunk, which of course anyone who has read later, more mature works like \\"Weaveworld,\\" \\"Sacrament\\" or  \\"Imajica\\" will realize how inaccurate that is.<br />I think Barker is nearly a poet of horror in these stories, with prose as elegant and vivid as any  of those writers mentioned above, and I think he deserves a wider  readership. Here, in this new trade paperback, he has written a great  introduction, one in which he reveals how he has changed over the years  since he wrote the \\"Books of Blood.\\" It's a thoughtful,  perceptive, funny, vulgar essay, classic Barker, and the visions you'll  find within are no less wonderful.<br />\\"Future of horror\\"?

Clive Barker outdoes himself with this story of Will Rabjohns, a homosexual British artist (hmmm....) who, for some unknown reason, allows himself to suffer a trauma in the natural world. It's pretty  interesting, so I won't give that away. While in a coma, he  dreams/remembers/revisits a strange couple he knew as a boy. Once he is  well again, Will travels back to England, to confront the mystery of his  past, his estranged father, and his boyhood friends. What we have here is a  metaphysical mystery tale, as a man confronts the past and the present, his  art and the world, and the strange powers that seem to power them all. As  with all of Barker's fiction, it is this confrontation that drives his  characters. What transformation awaits at the heart of this mystery? Who  are Jacob and Rosa Steep? They live fictions, through decades. There is a  dark, violent power that lies in their fingers, in their seductive charms.  In Will's photography of the world's wildlife, they see a  &quot;conduit&quot;--he brings to Jacob an unwelcome vision of a 19th  century artist named Thomas Simeon. (It's my guess that Simeon is a  stand-in for William Blake; it's no secret that Barker is besotted with the  man, and with good reason). There is a lineage from Simeon's art and  writings to Will's photography: life is hidden and waiting for apocalypse  in Simeon's work; its aftermath and extinction in Will's.<br /> I think this  books is magnificent. I'm shocked and appalled upon learning of some  readers' distaste for its homosexual depictions--they have no business  reading Clive Barker. I found this aspect to be incredibly well-done and  insightful, particularly scenes with Will and his lover.Will has an ache  for transcendence (as do so many of Barker's men and women--see Gentle and  Jude in &quot;Imajica,&quot; Cal Mooney in &quot;Weaveworld,&quot; or  Fletcher and the Jaff in &quot;the Art&quot; series), as does Jacob Steep.  One man who creates to get closer to God, one man who destroys.<br />How many  novels are written these days about such longing for God, for  transformation, to confront the mystery, to find out, &quot;Why have I  lived?&quot; Barker writes that perhaps, at the end, &quot;There'd be  understanding, there'd be revelation, there'd be an end to the ache in  him.&quot; The final scenes in the living heart of the world--the Mundus  Domini--are terrific; Barker's prose is masterful, pure, poised.  Here is  his Thomas Simeon, in one of the book's most wonderful passages: &quot;It  seems to me, we must invent religion every moment, as the world invents  itself, for the only constant is inconsistancy....It seems to me the  purpose of religion is to say: All things are so. An invented thing and a  thing we call true; a living thing and a thing we call dead; a visible  thing and a thing that is yet to be: All Are So.&quot;<br />How about THAT?  Barker is simply an excellent, lyrical writer, whose works reflect upon the  spiritual mysteries of our lives. That sometimes spirituality is a dark and  violent thing (see the Cenobites in &quot;Hellraiser&quot; or Immacolata in  &quot;Weaveworld&quot;) in no way diminishes its importance. I'm so glad  that Barker continues exploring these themes, fiercely imagining what  others deny. Critics and readers who continue to refer to Barker as a  &quot;horror writer&quot; are sadly, pathetically ignorant, lazy, and  closed-minded.

They're exposing reality for the social construct it is, showing  how easily people go along with it, how they adapt to even the most bizarre  &quot;set up&quot; and often revealing the power structures that control  our lives, and subvert them with not (only) political action, but humor,  razor-sharp wit, sparkling, spiky intelligence--and a whole lot of balls.  Absolutely worth every penny!	1998-10-31

After reading Harlan Ellison's comments about this book years ago, I knew I had to have it. Not an easy book to locate then, but once I had it... Oh my God. I'd never read a horror novel like it. It was bloated with the corruption and festering malignancy of Calcutta: \\"Some places are too evil to be allowed to exist.\\" With that provocative opening line, Simmons opens up a universe filled with an overpowering sense of the otherworldly that the Western mind cannot escape.<br />The novel feeds on our (inherent?) xenophobia, our fear of women (manifested in the devouring goddess of Kali), our passion for violence, and the all-too-real fear of our children taken from us. \\"All violence is power,\\" the poet Das says. \\"Sometimes there is no hope. Sometimes there is only pain.\\"<br />THAT, friends and neighbors, is the true crux of all great horror fiction, and Simmons doesn't hesitate to take us as far down the river at the heart of darkness. His knowledge of classic poetry, particularly Yeats, and Luczak's wife's knowledge of geometry, infuses this novel with an intelligence and moral weight most horror writers either fake or never bother with in the first place. And India has such a vast and bizarre mythology I'm surprised no one explored it before like this.<br />I love this book, and even picking it up again to write this review I'm tempted to read it a third time. Anyone with any knowledge of India's myths will find it all the more disturbing. The use of story-within-story that heightens the horror (for some reason I'm a sucker for this narrative trick; Lovecraft did it, King did it in \\"Pet Sematary\\", Anne Rice too-- it always chills me to the bone) I can't say enough of the fascination this book holds for me, its relentless darkness, its stench of rancid flesh, its charnel house images, its fusion of sex and death, its climax of delirium and fire--and the final moral stand of a man who comes to realize how truly helpless he is in the face of so much darkness.<br />Listen to the song of Kali if you have at all a true taste for the macabre, the funereal, the hopeless, the living dark, the taint of blood: \\"The world is pain/O terrible wife of Siva/  You are chewing the flesh/Your tongue is drinking the blood,  O dark Mother! O unclad Mother/O beloved of Siva/The world is pain.\\"<br />\\"The Age of Kali has begun/The Song of Kali is now sung.\\" Hear it? Listen....sten to the song of Kali if you have at all a true taste for the macabre, the funereal, the hopeless, the living dark, the taint of blood: \\"The world is pain/O terrible wife of Siva/   You are chewing the flesh/Your tongue is drinking the blood,   O dark Mother! O unclad Mother/O beloved of Siva/The world is pain.\\" <br />\\"The Age of Kali has begun/The Song of Kali is now sung.\\" Hear it? Listen....	1998-10-08

Burroughs, Vol. 1: 1945-1959	Books	5	28	32	N	N	Burroughs as a man, not as a legend	That Kirkus review is cheap, trite and obvious. &quot;Godfather of  Grunge&quot;? &quot;MTV generations' idea of a literay outlaw&quot;? What's  that mean? They were right when they said he didn't come off as a literary  &quot;fella&quot;--why? because Literature is phony and an obstruction to  truth--&quot;All that is literature has fallen from me, thank God,&quot;  wrote Henry Miller, and Burroughs exemplifies that. He was interested in  Life, and escaping oppression. Little is made of him shooting his wife?  Sorry. His heroin cures? Sorry. Save that for all the lame Hollywood hacks  who succumb to addiction only because they know their &quot;life  story&quot; will sell. I think this is a great book, one that shows the  human, caring, funny, straightforward man Burroughs was in a time of even  greater hypocrisy and corruption than today. I think he was dead on the  mark in the fifties about America becoming a police state.... Burroughs  still upsets conventional literary categories, and the only way the  &quot;establishment&quot; can deal with him is to joke and condescend and  offer him up as caricature, as Kirkus did. Did anyone read the pathetic  obituaries of him? They had no clue what he really did. As he said:  &quot;We intend to destroy all dogmatic verbal systems.&quot; No  glot....c'lom Fliday....	1998-09-25
US	52706658	R2OYUAGWE4S2DL	0060179473	645468601	Galilee	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A successful departure for Barker	&quot;Galilee&quot; is a strange one, since it mixes the horrible cliches of romance fiction and celebrity magazines with Barker's visionary and majestic style. Was he winking at us at times, tongue in cheek? I hope so! On a purely aesthetic level, I think this is Barker's best written novel--and yes, I've read everything--with passages of such poetic grace and lyricism I had to put the book down to catch my breath. And the current of eroticism that runs through this book--! Barker, bless him, has always been interested in the power sexuality plays in our lives, more so than any other genre writer; some of the scenes here gave me quite a thrill, even sitting in a coffeeshop filled with people! OK--as for the story, it's obvious Barker's going for the American angle, going after those old warhorses the Kennedys. I loved the fact that Garrison Geary was such a deeply perverted man, and is growing in perversity and power as the novel ends. I think the Civil War stuff was dead brilliant and truly horrifying in places. I do wish some of the characters had been fleshed out. Maddox was an interesting character, despite being somewhat passive. Actually, I think this novel is fun in a way Barker's books never have been. He's playing with all those corny conventions of crappy pop fiction, yet presenting us with fables and visions and ideas about divinity and spirituality you don't find anywhere. That's what makes Barker so unique in contemporary fiction. I find his metaphysics to be really thought-provoking and exciting, and he seems to be growing with every book (and I thought he'd said it all with &quot;Imajica&quot;!) And as a male reader, I love the way he puts women at the forefront--wait till you meet Cesaria, the Mother Goddess! Great descriptions of her. some people disliked the &quot;soft&quot; climax, but I didn't mind it. I don't always like big &quot;slam-bang&quot; endings, and the conflict between the Barbarossas and the Gearys is not over. BUT--what the heck is up with all the typos??? Who does!  the proofreading at HarperCollins? Come on! I've never read a book with so many errors. I wish Barker got more attention from so-called &quot;mainstream&quot; press--he is totally underrated as a writer; I know lots of well-read people who still think he's simply a horror writer. Arggh, I hate that! And I've met lots of novelists (I worked in a bookstore that specialized in author readings) who don't have nearly Barker's intelligence, curiosity, orjust simply his talent--what other writer can you name who's an accomplished playwright, painter, sketch artist, short story writer, novelist, and filmmaker? If any of you ever get the chance to hear him lecture--GO! Oh, &quot;Galilee&quot;--just fantastic. Sometimes melodramatic and silly, but always captivating. Great summer read, and one worthy to be put next to &quot;Imajica&quot; and &quot;Weaveworld.&quot; I can't wait for the next part.up with all the typos???

US	52706658	RHLFX8ANJ6SXP	0061093084	645468601	Everville: The Second Book of the Art	Books	5	2	3	N	N	EVERVILLE: Leaves on the Story Tree	EVERVILLE... the eternal city, the mythic point where this earth and the heavens meet, the &quot;axis mundi,&quot; the crossroads of eternity and time, the sacred and the profane. Is Clive Barker the only author of these sore days who sees into these crossroads? Barker continually impresses me with each new book, both in the themes and characters he explores, the language he uses, and his subversion of the both the horror and fantasy genres. If I see one more book review or interview that refers to him as a &quot;master of horror&quot; I'm gonna explode! He's got more in common with a Joseph Campbell, a William Blake or a Dali than any mere horror writer. I think EVERVILLE is a very good book; but yes, I did get some smirks and sneers from my &quot;literary&quot; acquaintances. They don't know what they're missing!<br />Barker's prose is as measured and musical as ever; this is the first book of his which, on several occasions, stirred me to tears. While reading it, I kept a pen nearby, underlining dozens of beautiful passages. The story flows effortlessly--which it needs to, as Barker understands, as Story is the only way things of consequence get told. As he writes: &quot;And every life, however short, however meaningless it seems, is a leaf on the story tree.&quot;<br />I think Barker did a pretty good job depicting &quot;everyday&quot; people in a small American town; a nice change from the distant misfits of his short stories and early novels. There is risk-taking here on his part, and yes, sometimes some of the Americana rings a tad false, and I was little let down by the literalization of Quiddity, but any writer who has the courage to revision Jesus, the Christ--the Christ of Dreams, and Dreaming--in the course of a &quot;popular&quot; novel, has my utmost admiration. Of course, anyone who's read IMAJICA knows Barker does not shy away from a radical spirituality.<br />I love his depiction of reality as ever in flux, something malleable and always in transformation. As Joe Flicker asks himself, travelling through the Metacosm: &quot;But when he slept here, and dreamed, was he entering yet another reality, beyond this one, where he might also sleep and dream?&quot;<br />Stories and dreams have always made and remade the world; we are never satisfied with Reality. Why else would we regale ourselves with tales and visions of resurrections and journeys, virgin births and sacred mountains, men of wisdom and women of purity? All of this is &quot;the Great and Secret Show&quot; we never tire of, and Barker seems to effortlessly reach behind the veil and pluck out our appetites, our perversities, our loves and our hopes, our desires to comprehend these mysteries. That, I think, is the Art: a skill to divine our souls.<br />Buddenbaum, desiring communion with the &quot;gods&quot;, expresses this eloquently: &quot;to be free of every frailty, including love; free to live out of time, out of place, out of every particular. He would be unmade, the way divinites were unmade, because divinities were without beginning and without end: a rare and wonderful condition.&quot;<br />The visions in this book! The creation of the Metacosm (a Jungian archetype if ever there was one) by Maeve O'Connell and Coker Ammiano--a whorehouse at the crossroads, negating the bluster about this nation being found on Christian values... Flicker in the Metacosm, and absorbed into the 'Shu (pieces of the Creator), then into the Iad, then a wandering spirit dreamed to glorious flesh by his lover Phoebe; the transformation of Tesla, and the glimpses she gives to D'Amour of stories to come; the Death-Boy cradling a child &quot;to his burned body, whistling for the killing cloud to follow him&quot;; Lucien's talk of us being &quot;vessels for the infinite&quot;; the description of the city b'Kether Sabbat, &quot;shaped like an inverted pyramid, balanced on its tip.&quot; Yes, all those, and more, right this way....<br /><br />This is an amazing book, a grippingread, an epic in the making of &quot;four journeys&quot; as Barker writes: &quot;One to the dream world, one to the real; one to the bestial; one to the divine.&quot; It's a more than worthy sequel to 1989's THE GREAT AND SECRET SHOW. Read this book carefully,! savor its elegance and ferocity of imagination, and you will be uplifted.

Would that more books were published that looked so unflinchingly at this world. When I bought this book people thought I was crazy, and my roommate said, after flipping through it, &quot;Don't... like, show this to a date or anything.&quot; Whoo boy. But the book made me flinch, so I had to have it. I was afraid to sleep with it in my room. But I love how Katherine Dunn writes that &quot;There were no good old days,&quot; that politicians and others who have a vested interest in making those days seem sane and ordered live in a fantasy world. I think this is an important work, and it's too bad people think those who are interested in this stuff are just gorehounds. Yes, I love the edgy and macabre, but I also like serious, detached, and eloquent approaches to it. This is for a special type of reader, but I truly believe our interest in this field is (mostly) healthy. What are you waiting for? Get the book!	1998-05-15

I know of no other writer who makes words truly live like Henry Miller does. &quot;Cancer&quot; is his best (although the neglected &quot;Colossus of Maroussi&quot; runs a close second), full of enthusiasm, rampant lust-driven adventures, a man living though it rain crocodiles, a visionary portrait of a person determined to live in this cracked and dying earth that will drag you down and suffocate you if you let it. Living has nothing to do with money. It has nothing to do with prestige, nothing to do with a career, with laws or codes or good sense. It has everything to do with sex, with art and inspiration, with creativity and the fire at our heels, the hunger that gnaws us from the inside out. My friends and I had a joke: &quot;What happened in the bidet?&quot; &quot;Read the book!&quot; Unfortunately I think they only knew because I told them. I carried this book around, and his others, for months, enraptured, exhuasted, tormented, joyous, breathless, during a very bleak period of my life. He kept my imagination alive. The first time I tried to read it, just after the 1990 film &quot;Henry &amp; June&quot; I didn't get it. About a year or so later I tried again, and ate it up. It was like I had a tropic of cancer-sized hole in my head and I'd finally found the missing piece. No other book, except maybe &quot;Naked Lunch,&quot; has made me realize that literature IS life, that my heart could be enlarged by one, that reading and writing weren't just hobbies or exercises--they were raw and painful necessities, as vital as breath, as flesh, as rousing and invigorating as sex at 3am that lasts til dawn. I love all kinds of writers, but I have to admit, I'm kind of a snob. To me, the real writer is one like Henry Miller, like Rimbaud, like Poe, the ones who live at the fringes of madness, who in poverty and tatters show us that it's life, and life only.	1998-05-15

Joseph Campbell was one of the great souls of our age. I've read this book twice, first on my own and the second for a class in &quot;Myth, Religion &amp; the Mythic Imagination.&quot; I read the paperack to tatters, literally, marking each illuminating, exhilirating insight. &quot;Dry&quot;? &quot;Not a fun read&quot;? What book did YOU read? Campbell is unlike other writers on myth; he looks not at an entire myth but at its parts. By the end of the book, he has essentially created the Ultimate Hero Myth, which takes bits of every hero myth from virtually every culture (heavy on Native Americans). Campbell was not a dispassionate academic--this was his gospel, and he lived by it. This book is alive and inspiring like no other book I know. One unique aspect of it at the time it was published was its approach to Christianity. For Campbell, Christ's life had to be seen as a myth. Before him, most Western scholars wouldn't have dare to say such a thing. Others had written on that, but in a skeptical manner. Campbell's view is that the Virgin Birth, miracles, Resurrection, etc have meaning only because they ARE myths. Look, there'd be no &quot;Star Wars&quot; without this. No &quot;Sandman&quot; comics from Neil Gaiman. No &quot;Watership Down.&quot; This book is for the intellectual who wants to LIVE, not just to sit sterile at the desk.

The art reproductions are deliriously good; as for the brief writer bios, I mean come on, the names themselves are an intoxicant: Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Verlaine, Manet, Van Gogh, Picasso, Jarry, Wilde, Hemingway... Good Lord man, thank you! I found the historical aspect provocative--was it 1890s France, or 1990s &quot;drug hysteria&quot; America? I recommended it to plenty of customers where I work and they loved it. It's virtually the only book out there on the subject! Strange coincidence: the day after I read it, I saw the (then) new Nine Inch Nails video &quot;Perfect Drug&quot; &amp; guess what potent &amp; exotic liquour our man Trent Reznor was imbibing? The whole production design was fin-de-siecle artwork. I hope the MTV kids were paying attention!

Gilles de Rais is probably an unfamiliar name to most, but he was a lieutenant of Joan of Arc's. They fought closely together but after she was executed, well, he became one of history's first serial murderers. He killed up to 200 children in horrible ways--Dahmer and Bundy have nothing on Gilles de Rais. Wolf writes very well, and tries to understand the psychology of such a character. De Rais was contradictory--murder for him was a way to reach God, or the Devil, or something divine and not of this world. Wolf is an expert on horror &amp; Gothic lit. Well-researched &amp; more readable than others on de Rais. If you're one of those people who think movie &amp; tv violence instigate horrible acts, just remember Gilles de Rais. He wasn't wasn't watching no Oliver Stone movie, that's for sure.	1998-04-27

I was extremely excited to look up &quot;Horror&quot; here &amp; find not some Koontz or Saul or Rice travesty recommended by readers, but ATROCITY EXHIBITON. A very difficult work. Some experimental, avant-garde stuff just irritates me, but the reason I kept at Ballard was because I believed him. I had to crack it open. Break it. Made me bleed a little. Your mind starts to fill in narrative gaps in the disjointed structure that are more disturbing than anything Ballard could come up with. The cool, clinical, obsessive prose and particularly the idead of &quot;a technology of pornography&quot; I found especially enticing. Be on the lookout for his great short &quot;The Terminal Beach&quot;--Traven/Travis appears there too. I don't want every book to be like this, but in a world of Anne Tylers and Mary Higgins Clarks and even (god forbid I take his name in vain!) Charles Frazier it's good to know this stuff is being read and appreciated. My friends think I'm crazy and pretentious for liking it--but I really do!	1998-04-27
