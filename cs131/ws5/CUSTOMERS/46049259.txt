This book really shows the importance of meditation and being in tune with yourself. It shows how we can solve many of our problems just by being in tune with ourselves.  <br /> <br />Sometimes we have to lose a little in order to gain some.  In Carmen's case she finally found true love after she lost part of her beauty.   <br /> <br />With the exception of the cover, I'd have to say that I really enjoyed this book.  I hope the author is working on something else.	2005-10-03

And also the first time I find myself looking forward to a sequel for one of Anita's books. I was very satisfied with the way the book ended. It had closer. But for some reason I find myself falling in love with the three surviving characters. I really would like to see how things turns out for Sara Jane and Craig. Also one of the viewers made a very good point regarding the fact that the author didn't elaborate much on Sara Jane's mother, other then the sketch book she left behind, which is the only connection Sara has to her mother.  <br /> <br />As usual, this was another story beautifully written by Anita Bunkley. It's also been a while since she's written anything new. I hope she's working on her next book.	2005-09-10

I proceed to read this novel inspite of some of the negative comments that I've heard. And it turned out to be a great book.   <br /> <br />I wouldn't exactly call this book a page turner, but an interesting story that will have you thinking long after you're done with the book.   <br /> <br />Ross and Asha were an example of two  people who were thirsty, and they drank and drank until they quench their thirst, without the thought of where this water was coming from.  Another words, they didn't think about the consequences behind the act they just committed. Asha didn't think about losing the only family she ever had, and Ross didn't think on how it would jeopardize his marriage until it was too late. All it took was a little communication and things would've never gone that far. <br /> <br />I was really touched by this story.  In a way I thought it was kind of sad to see a lifetime of friendship going down the drain like that.  Although Lisa and  Asha were somewhat still on speaking term at the end, things will never be the same again.  It will take many,many years to heal those wounds.   <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />	2005-08-29

With the exception of Patricia and Marcus who didn't have much choice. Everyone of these characters one way or another were paying  a price for the choices that they made:  Gail dream house, husband, and familly did come true, but what a price she had to pay.  Marcus went through practically his whole life trying to sleep in a bed that his brother made for him.  And Patricia, lets just say that her bed was also made for her .  Now Ramsy is a perfect example of trying to sleep in the bed you made.  Ramsy's bed was hot.  He couldn't even sleep in it.  For a moment I kind of felt sorry about what happened to Ramsy.  But then I realized that Ramsy was just a poor soul who had to be taking out of his misery.   <br /> <br />Patricia and Gails frienship shows the power of the word \\"if\\". I feel that Gail hitting rock bottom was a way to bring her and Patricia together.  Which also taught her a great lesson. If things had gone smoothly for Gail, I don't think her and Pat would have reunited as friends. Sometimes we have to hit rock bottom in order to appreciate what we have.   <br /> <br />	2005-05-23

Which I think is unfair.  Before we start making accusations, I think it is very important that we look into the person past, hopefully we maybe able to come up with a solution to the problem. <br /> <br />In Ruth's case, I believe the ill treatment that she received from her grandmother after her mother's death is one of the reasons why  she had such low self-esteem and so vulnerable which lead her into Eric's Arm.  A man who I can best describe as a sub-human, a predator who preys on: naive, vulnerable people with low self-esteem.  <br /> <br />Considering what Ruth had gone through with that man, I felt that last violent act was unecessary.  Then again, that's just being realistic.  In the real world these men are not satisfied until the person is dead or something.  <br /> <br />I recommend this book to all women.  Especially the ones who's never witness or experience violence.  I think this book can be served as a guide. Kind of give you ideas on what to do in such circumstances. <br /> <br />This was in excellent debut.  I look forward to reading more books by this author.	2004-07-26

Other than the historical part of the book, which I felt was unecessary, I thought it was a very interesting story with a lot of meaning.  Anne who was my favorite character in the book was an example of the choices that we make sometime.  I think her decision to mary that brute was due to a lack of proper guidance,lack of unity in her family, and vulnerability which got her mistaking lust for love. <br />Anne's involvement with Scott Hamilton, was like putting a curse on herself and her family.  Prior to meeting Scott, I think Anne had a very promissing future.

Next thing she meet this man on a cruise,and Mignon didn't know that man she met years in Paris was actually her biological father.  How can you deny your daughter such great inheritance. I think the situation with her and Pierre was just a total misunderstand. After a while, things was not making sense.  Like I said, I was really enjoying this book until I got to the end.  <br />Although I was disappointed on how this book ended, I won't give up on the author.  After all, that was her first, and I think she made a great effort. I just hope that she finds a better editor next time.	2002-12-16

Especially, the little boy.  It's a shame how he went to the extreme of paying a tribute to his brother, fifteen years after his death, only to convince Hattie to come back to a place that she'd vowed never to set foot<BR>ever again. So,he can have custody of his grand nephew, in the name of fame. I don't think he would try to gain custody of Sonny, if his brother wasn't famous.  <br />At the end of the book,it seems like Hattie was dealing with a mixture of emotions: Confused, sad and Angry for going against her first intuations, after she received the letter. <br />I didn't like the way Edgar Payne try to gain custody of Sonny through deception. If by any chance the author decides to have a sequel to this book, I hope that Sonny remains with Hattie in France, home where he belongs.  Blood or not, Hattie is the one who nurtured Sonny from the time he was born. Also, I think she was very considerate to inform him that he had a great nephew. Is this the price she had to pay for being honest.  <br />I really hope there is a sequel to this book.	2002-09-16

Although, I love all three characters.

I believe<BR>if they had a child, Nikita's death would not affect him he way it did. Quinn felt lost after her death.  All he had left was some wonderful memories. Nothing else. <br />From the beginning of the series, I felt that all three characters needed closer.  Maxine and Quinn was attracted to each other. But, didn't know exactly what they really felt, until they got involved.  Nikita on the other hand, loved Grant.  But, wasn't very pleased with him sexually. <br />As sad as the story may be, the author was being realistic. Unfortunately, those things happen in the real world.

There was a lot of messages in this book.  I was <BR>deeply touched by some of the things that happen in this book.<br />Being deprived for so long, caused Netta to become very greedy, to the point where it almost took her life. Besides her greed which I think was her only flaw,I think she was a beautiful person with good heart and great ambitions.  Not many people would manage to finish school living the way she was. Also, doing what she did for her mom. Netta and Mimi were my two favorite characters.  Although Mimi had her flaws(Jealousy and a low self esteem)I still liked her.  She was a weak person who always needed someone behind her. And Netta was that person.  She was just a poor soul.  <br />In the beginning, I kind of liked black.  After Nard gave him control of that spot, I saw that monster comming out of him.  From that point on, I start hating him.  I understand what Netta did was wrong, but that black was ruthless. <br />Although I did enjoy this book and could not put it down, I was dissapointed with the end.  I don't think she should've been the one responsible for that person's life in the end.  After all the trouble she had gone through as a child, and two encounters with death,  I don't think it was fear for her to live life with such a heavy load on her concious. I felt bad fer her and the victim. I understand this book is not your typical happily ever after type book, but I felt that the end didn't have to be so sad. I was deeply touched. It's been a week since I've read the the book, and I'm just now getting over it. <br />Shannon I really love your work. Just try not to make the ending so sad next time.	2002-04-08

This was a very interesting story well put together.  The characters were well developed. I find the romantic scene with Lisa and (whose name I will not mention so I won't spoil it for the other readers)interesting. It brought back some childhood memories. Although I kind of felt that he was taking advantage of Lisa naivete, I still felt he was in a way an angel in desguise. Not only that he saved her from Zebo, I cannot imagine Sean being the first after what he did to her. It is also Ironic that Sean is studying law after committing such an act.  <br />I understand that the auther is presently working on the sequel to this book entitled BROKEN BEYOND BEYOND REPAIR.  I cannot wait.  I wonder what that's going to be like.

However, if she doesn't confide in someone about what Exactly Sean did to her, I'm afraid she will be consumed by guilt. Once she explained to someone exactly what what happen to her.

But some of the characters (Anthony, Leslie and Zabree)were not well developed. I think she spend too much time on Imagany and Elliot love Scene. The first love scene took almost a whole chapter.  I understand the book is a romance novel and that they were the main characters. I still thought It was uncessary.  To me I think, It was either she add another hundred pages to this book or stop elaborating on every love scene.  I think that would make it possible for her to further develope  those other characters. For instance ,I think she could have been more realistic with the with Imagany and Anthony domestic dispute. You mean to tell me police walks in a house. Pick up an unconcious man, followed by no court appearance. Later on his in a the Jet magazine with a woman who pay money just to be with him.  I also wish the auther would have spent more time on Zabree. That part was so sad.  I really wanted to see how she turned out. I admired Imagany and Caprices friendship. That was my favorite part in the book beside the love scenes. Some of the viewers thought Imagany was  greedy for money. I didn't think so. It's not like she went after men with money. they came to her. Prior to Leslie's appearance she was willing to leave Anthony, for Elliot who barely had anything. I won't give up on this auther.  After all this was just her first novel. So far the preview to her next book seems pretty good.	2001-03-30

It seems to me sometime, in order to find happiness and compadability in a relationship we have to cross over to another generation,wether it be a much younger or older man.<br />For those of you who haven't read the book go get your copy.  It's worth it.  I think this writer has great potentials. I wish her the best and looking forward to her next book CHOCOLATE SHIP.	2001-03-17

Regardless of how smart our children are and how much we talk to them. This book shows how powerful peer pressure can be.  I realized a lot was left to the imagination. I really wanted to know how things turned out between Haleem and Moxie. I really enjoyed the story.I just wish It was a bit longer.	2001-03-10

ALTHOUGH THE STORY DID SEEM INTERESTING. FOR SOME REASON I DIDN'T CARE MUCH FOR THE BOOK.  I THINK IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE COVER.  THEN I THOUGHT TO MYSELF AND SAID, YOU CANNOT JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER.  SO, I BAUGHT THE BOOK.  AFTER THE FIRST THREE PAGES, I COULD NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN.  I AM AFRAID IF I TRY TO EXPRESS HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS BOOK AND HOW I ENJOYED, I MIGHT SPOIL IT FOR THE OTHER READERS IN THE PROCESS.  THEREFORE I WILL CONCLUDE MY REVIEW BY SIMPLY SAYING THAT, THIS WAS A BEAUTIFUL STORY WELL PUT TOGETHER AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.  MUCH SUCCESS TO THE AUTHER.  KEEP ON WRITING AND I WILL KEEP ON READING.	2001-02-19

It turned out to be a very good book. I could not put it down, specially when I got the end. the end is full of surprises.   I understand as viewers, we do have a right to express ourselves. but I cannot understand how someone could hate this book to the point where they feel that this book should have never been published.	2001-02-18

IT IS EASY TO BECOME VULNERABLE AFTER BEING TREATED THE WAY HER HUSBAND WAS TREATING HER.  BECAUSE SHE WAS DEPRIVED FOR SO LONG, SHE WAS OVERWHELMED BY THE ATTENTION THAT SHE WAS GETTING FROM DAVID.  I UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WAS NAIVE.  BUT SOMETIME WHEN CHE SPOKE TO HER I THINK SHE BELIEVED HER BUT WAS IN DENIAL BECAUSE DAVID MADE HER FEEL SO SPECIAL.  CHE ON THE OTHER HAND IS THE KIND OF PERSON I REFER TO AS DISPOSABLE FRIENDS.  ONCE YOU FIND OUT WHAT THEY ARE ABOUT YOU LEAVE THEM ALONE. IT DOESN'T MAKE SINCE TO KEEP PEOPLE LIKE CHEZ AROUND.  UNFORTUNATELY AMBER HAD TO LEARN THE HARD WAY, WICH  I BELIEVE HAPPEN TO MANY OF US. IT WAS A GREAT STORY I JUST WISH THE BOOK WAS A BIT LONGER.	2001-02-12

THE SAD PART ABOUT THIS STORY IS HOW, JUST ABOUT ALL THE MAIN CHARACTERS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SUFFERED A LOSS. TO BEGIN WITH:  BEVERLY, JABARI, AND BIG TIME LOSER DERIKA.  LOOK WHAT HAPPEN TO HER WHEN SHE FINALLY FOUND SOMEONE WHO SEEMED TO CARE FOR HER.  BECAUSE OF HER STUPIDITY,  SHE MISSED OUT ON A GOOD OPPORTUNITY.  ALTHOUGH ODESSIA APPEARS TO BE THE ONLY WINNER, I THINK IT'S A FALSE VICTORY BECAUSE OF THE WAY SHE WENT ABOUT THINGS. IT WAS NOT NATURAL.	2001-02-03

FOR SOME REASON THIS BOOK REMINDS ME OF THE MAINTENANCE MAN.  I THINK ANYONE WHO HAS READ THE MAINTENANCE MAN WILL FIND THIS BOOK INTERESTING.	2001-01-29

IT IS AMAZING HOW THE AUTHER WRITES ABOUT SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND YET VERY INTERESTING.  I UNDERSTAND THAT SHADOW LOVER IS TO BE FOLLOWED BY FIVE OTHER TITLES. I CANNOT WAIT.	2001-01-29

I THINK BOTH BOOKS ARE DEALING WITH THE SAME ISSUE BUT ON A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE.  TRUE TO THE GAME.IN MY OPINION WAS MORE POSITIVE THAN COLDEST WINTER EVER.  AFTER QUADIR BECAME A MILLIONAIRE, HE REALIZED WHAT THE GAME WAS ALL ABOUT AND BAUGHT HIS WAY OUT. SANTIAGA DIDN'T HAVE ANY INTENTION ON STOPPING UNTIL THE FEDS CAUGHT UP WITH HIM.  HIS KIDS FOLLOWED THE SAME PATH.  IF ANY OF YOU VIEWERS READ THE COLDEST WINTER EVER, DO YOU REMEMBER WINTER'S YOUNGER SITER PORCH.  SHE WAS FOLLOWING THE SAME PATH.  IN COMPARISON TO SANTIAGA FROM COLDEST WINTER EVER.  FOR A YOUNG PERSON, I THINK QUADIR WAS MUCH SMARTER THAN SANTIAGA.  QUADIR DIED AND LEFT MILLIONS BEHIND. ALL OF SANTIAGA'S ASSET WAS EXPOSED.  THAT'S WHY WHEN THE FEDS CAME HE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING LEFT.  <br />MY REASON FOR WRITING THIS, IS NOT COMPARE TO THE AUTHERS BUT TO SHOW YOU HOW THEY ARE WRITNG ABOUT THE SAME THING. ONE SHOWS MORE POSITIVE AND THE OTHER SHOWS MORE NEGATIVE.	2001-01-16

SHE WAS SO HURT. I THINK HAVING A LITTLE QUADIR AROUND TO HOLD ON TO WOULD REALLY CONSOLE HER. FOR SOME REASON, AS I WAS READING THE BOOK, I WAS HOPING THAT THEY WOULD MENTION SOMETHING ABOUT PRENANCY. SHE WAS UNDER SO MUCH STRESS, SHE WOULD EVEN KNOW WETHER SHE WAS PREGNANT OR NOT.  I'M HOPING FOR A SEQUEL TO THIS BOOK. AS FAR GENA IS CONCERN, I THINK THERE IS DEFINITELY ROOM FOR A SEQUAL.	2001-01-15
