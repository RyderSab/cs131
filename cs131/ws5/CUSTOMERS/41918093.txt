Wodehouse held by everyone who knew him was that he was very pleasant, sweet and good-natured, but also rather boring. He was never witty. His conversation centered around writing and sport.<br /><br />Mr. McCrum has pulled off a tour-de-force and written a biography that is captivating. He has obviously done his research and he doesn't gloss over the unseemly events of World War II. But he also shows the generous side of a man who was notorious for watching his pennies.<br /><br />This is truly an excellent biography that reveals much about late Victorian and Edwardian England. Wodehouse was the great comic writer of his day, and this book shows what it took for him to achieve his apparently effortless prose.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in writing.	2004-11-22

A fantastical Horatio Alger story, Sonea rises from direst poverty to excellence, esteem and even love. This is very satisfying fluff. The characters are well drawn and the plot nicely convoluted, with just enough twists to keep you entertained for the length of the book.	2004-09-01

Sonea grows a bit here and acquires more of a conscience. The other characters are expanded more and the tale is told from 4 separate viewpoints. There's some serious bullying, a good fight at the climax, a mystery or two, a red herring, tales of adventure as the story moves out of the confines of the city into the greater world and a little romance.<br />All in all this is a good successor to the first book in the series.  Also, as the middle book in a trilogy, it has a suprisingly satisfactory end, with just enough plot hooks to keep the reader interested without being too much of a cliffhanger.	2004-04-28

It is written at about their standard. As such, it is, in my opinion, better than The Forest, which to my mind is the worst of Mr. Rutherfurd's books.<br />If you have not read Mr. Rutherfurd, the best comparison is to the later books of James Michener. As an introduction to his works, this book is less than adequate as it only represents the first half of the story. It very much ends in mid story.<br />This will make a lovely beach book. It's nicely rambling with several generations of interesting characters set in a variety of historical settings. And as such has no pretensions to high literature. It is a good read.	2004-03-21

As a memoir of a generally low regarded job, it is a first rate book.	2004-03-21

Mr. Phillips is unburdened by any real economics knowledge and it shows. This book is trite, tired and erroneous. There is a book waiting to be written by a Marxist or Keynesian about the intersection of wealth and power in American political history, but this isn't it.	2004-01-18

You'll love the themes of this book if you are on the left, you'll hate it if you are on the right. If you are in the middle, however, cousin John's writing style will leave you parched and reaching for water.<br />This book is unlikely to change anyone's mind about the current Administration's foreign policy. John is an ex-Clintonian and that informs his perspective. He is also a Foggy Bottom traditionalist. The problem with his critique is that what he focuses on is the revolutionary changes that the new administration has wrought on our foreign policy. The Bush administration is, unlike previous ones, committed to revolution. Their belief is that the current state of affairs abroad, especially in the middle east, are unsustainable and contrary to our national interest. If you accept that premise, then the correct approach to US foreign policy is regime change.<br />The upshot to all of that is that John is focused upon the process with out really addressing, at length and in depth, the ideology underlying the process.<br />And did I mention that this book is slow reading?<br />In a nutshell, this book will not change anyone's mind.	2003-10-07

Mr. Roberts left himself plenty of room to write a series and it shows. This book does not have any sense of completion about it. The ending such as it is, consists mostly of plot hooks for at least one future book.	2003-05-03

McManus is a legitimate writer and his style is excellent and unobtrusive. He weaves several diverse threads together into a wonderful story. Like all good books this is a book about a lot more than just its main subject.<br />Mr. McManus puts you into the center of the action and deftly explains what is going so even the merest poker dunce will be enthralled as he tells his tale of gambling in poker paradise.	2003-04-21

We have just seen all of these in the recent conflict and Ms. Charen's book provides the evidence that this is a recurring feature of the extreme left.<br />Unless and until Messrs Carter, Clinton, Edwards, Kerry, Kennedy and Chomsky are willing to forthrightly condemn the regimes of Castro and Kim, they will continue to lack any foreign policy credibility. Ms. Charen documents the ongoing historical revisionism of the Cold War. The West won it, no thanks to the left and in spite of it. The inability of the \\"Useful Idiots\\" of the title to see both their idiocy and utility to the regimes of tyrants is the subject of this book.<br />I wish that such a book were not necessary, but as long as politicians appease, support and aid tyrants, the documentation of their efforts is vital. Ms. Charen has done excellent work in supplying the historical evidence.	2003-04-20

Cato is rehabilitated a bit in this book, as is Brutus. Caesar loses some of his lustre. The bits with Octavian were especially good, showing him to be very cool and calculating even as a young man.	2002-12-08

Her voice is consistent between the written and spoken word. She is very political and very Democratic, so that informs her writing. If open bias bothers you, or that particular bias bothers you, give this book a miss.<br />The Buffy bit was very amusing, as were some of the historical passages. Some of the rest I found less. However, humour is notoriously subjective, so your mileage may vary.<br />I found this book good reading on a gray, rainy day. It's not Pulitzer material, but it is a bit of sunshine for a dreary afternoon.	2002-12-08

While this book is not as overtly profound as V for Vendetta, it makes some points, but in a very light way.<br />Gene Ha's art is a delight, and the level of detail is insane. Anyone who has had a passing interest in comics will find cameos by their favorite characters somewhere in here.<br />This book is a sequel and you should have either Book One or the first six books of the series before reading this.	2002-09-06

This is a 'useful bit of cinnamon', to quote Kierkegaard, for that debate. Ms. Malcolm does not overtly editorialize, but allows her facts to present themselves. Anyone who is serious about learning about the effects of guns on violent crime rates would be well advised to read this. The fanatics on either side  will not find this comfortable reading.	2002-09-06

The bit where Our Heroine winds up tutoring not only her bassist, but several of his classmates in order to secure permission from his mother for him to play gigs is screamingly funny. Ms. Sincero has a good ear for dialogue. This is an excellent train or bus book, as it rewards the reader with humour, but it is put-downable.	2002-09-06

This book is very readable, but entirely too revisionist to be truthful. Zinn is more interested in his class perspective than in actually portraying history.

The author is too concerned with showing how clever he is to be bothered with a plausible plot or believable characters. The central character in particular was totally unbelievable.

It's condition is terminal but not serious, as the Russians say. Whatever you think of the causes for that, you will enjoy this book, if you love theatre. Mr. Steyn provides an excellent, if short history of Broadway, interspersed with lively criticism of the 'state of the stage'. Sondheim, in particular, receives some cutting thrusts. Reading it, I alternatively wanted to shout in Mr. Steyn's face and shake him by the hand. I laughed, I cried, I threw the book across the room at least three times, but I couldn't put it down.	2002-09-02

The basis for the story has enough truth to it to merit a suspension of disbelief. There are an ample supply of red herrings to distract the reader, each of which is plausible. The pacing is a little choppy and the dual points of view (first person and third person omniscient) do not blend as well as they ought.<br />On the other hand, the bad guys are very, very bad and the good guys are believable, and largely sympathetic.	2002-08-16

The idea of updating the classic revenge novel has a great deal of merit, but this is not the book that pulls it off. The ending is classically and depressingly modern British and as such is unsatisfying to anyone who does not have bad teeth and live in an awful climate. Perhaps the audio version will benefit more from Mr. Fry's excellent sense of comic timing.	2002-07-24

Ann Coulter has written a book that is full of the good stuff. She gets a little repetitious in the end, but the attacks just never stop. She even makes some good points along the way.<br />If you are looking for a balanced appraisal of media bias, give this book the miss. If you like firm opinions well-stated (even when you disagree with them), then this will be a rewarding read. Miss Coulter is not trying to win over the left's hearts and minds, she is rallying the troops on the right. I expect the points she raises here to be brought up again by other rightists throughout the coming election year.	2002-06-27

This personal narrative of growing up in Africa is written by one of the losers in the Zimbabwe/Rhodesia conflict. Her parents were determined to remain in Africa on their own terms and paid the price for their fight. This is probably the best account of the personal struggle of the last of the colonialists. Fuller's writing is intense, economical and unsentimental.	2001-12-21
