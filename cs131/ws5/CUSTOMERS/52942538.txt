However, after having just read about Suzanne Roth's experiences in this book, I am now convinced that boarding was the better path.<br />This is a thin book and rather pricy for its size, but if you're considering the pet sitting business, it will give you a good sense of the obstacles facing the pet sitter. Roth describes her adventures with short stories ranging from the friendly dog who isn't so friendly... to the suspiciously-still lizard... to the alarm systems that don't accept the codes provided by the owners.<br />The one downfall of the book is that it is short on instruction. There is some useful information in the 'Some Advice' section, but it is not a 'how to' primer on pet sitting. The stories will not give you insight into how to work around your own pet sitting dilemmas. And as another reviewer suggested... having to frequently call your husband to bail you out of difficult situations is not a 'professional' solution. Still, the stories will give you a feeling for the difficulties of the business and by the end of the book, you will have a sense as to whether this is the right business for you.	2003-07-24

The street names are listed alphabetically, with a few paragraphs about how each street got its name. Some listings have more content than others. There's also an interesting section on house-numbering, which didn't start until the late 1700s. Another section lists when specific roads operated as toll roads between 1711 and 1918.<br />In the book's introduction, which I also found interesting, the author explains some of the obstacles in doing this project--particularly the 'lack of cohesive record-keeping by the city' and the misinformation and erroneous data in the 'seemingly authoritative newspaper clippings.'<br />I would've liked to have seen longer descriptions and some street maps included for reference. Overall though, it's an excellent book for anyone interested in Philadelphia. In addition to teachers, I think it would also benefit anyone putting together local tours or a 'historical neighborhood' association.	2002-01-09

It is as though the author wrote 25 pages about chihuahuas and just pasted it into a generic book about dogs. After the first 25 pages, the rest of this book addresses dog selection, house-breaking, health care, breeding, dog shows, and more. <br />Although most of the content in these sections can be applied to chihuahuas--some of it is misleading. <br />For example, there is no mention in the feeding section about problems that chihuahuas can have with hypoglycemia. Also, a life expectancy chart is shown that goes up to 21 years old. However, it would be a rare chihuahua to live that long. What's worse, is that a choke collar is mentioned in the section about training. Because chihuahuas are small and it does not take much pressure to damage their tracheas, you would NEVER use a choke collar on a chihuahua. Even the information about using a leash and collar is a little dubious. (It's safer to walk chihuahuas with a leash and harness.) <br />Unfortunately, the only thing I can recommend about this book are the photographs.	2001-12-24

The tree is described as having branches that spread 116 ft and it is noted: &quot;Around it took place the annual Fairlop Fair -- an event which helped to shorten the tree's life, because visitors would use the inside of the trunk to light fires for cooking.&quot; <br />Another entry that appears earlier in 1741 mentions the opening of St. George's Chapel in  Curzon Street by a Reverend Alexander Keith who &quot;scandalized the clergy by his readiness to perform marriages without too many questions.&quot;<br />Many event descriptions run for a few paragraphs and some have illustrations. My only gripe with this book is that the font size for the print is very small. (The print would be much easier to read if it was just another 2 points larger.)  Aside from that, I'm sure this book will appeal to anyone with an interest in London history.	2001-10-23

Much of the content addresses the major real estate transactions and how land became subdivided among families, business partners, etc. There are maps showing the early layout of streets. There are stories about how many buildings were constructed, with special attention given to architectural details. In the downtown area, some of the finest buildings mingled with the most infamous. For example, the area around what is now the &quot;West End,&quot; used to be Frogtown--one of the most notorious red light districts. <br />Along the way, the book highlights the lives and contributions of many early residents--such as Robert S. Munger and Captain William H. Gaston--whose surnames are now the names of major Dallas streets.<br />The influence of different ethnic and religious groups is also addressed. One example was the establishment of La Reunion Colony by European immigrants who wanted to create a Utopian society. When La Reunion failed, many of the settlers moved to East Dallas in the 1850s, rather than return to Europe, and this area of East Dallas was later called 'Swiss Avenue&quot; in deference to them. <br />Another movement was that of newly freed slaves at the end of the Civil War. Many freedman began settling in the area around an old rural black cemetary, which was eventually called Freedmantown. Other black communities developed around areas that provided greater employment opportunities. One of these areas was Deep Ellum, where many black-owned businesses operated in the 1920s. <br />North Dallas began to grow as the southern part became increasingly industrial. Such was the case of The Cedars. The Cedars was an 'exclusive' address until the railroad lines began surrounding the region and the area became very industrialized. The final straw was the fouling of Mill Creek. Many of the wealthier residents moved north toward Highland Park and Swiss Avenue.<br />This book is organized into several major sections based primarily on the different areas of Dallas. I would have liked to have seen better organization. The material is very interesting but there is much to wade through, and the use of minor headings to organize the material would have helped greatly. The photographs throughout the book are well-documented. In many cases, there is not only a brief history and details of the building's location, but also a follow-up on what later happened to the building. <br />HOWEVER, if you approach this book like I did, and first run through each of the photos, studying the buildings and reading their descriptions--then, prepare for a terrible sense of LOSS. Because the vast majority of these buildings no longer exist, and the enormity of it will become more apparent as you try to search through the photos, looking for that rare building that might be still standing. Read their descriptions and you'll find that most of them were torn down to build parking lots, highways, sub-standard apartment complexes--or simply razed 'for commercial purposes.' You may get an overwhelming sense of how Dallas has demolished much of its history in return for quick commercial expansion.	2001-10-21

Unless you've done some indexing, you may not realize that indexing requires considerable knowledge--and this rings more true when you consider that 35% of the indexers appearing in this book's 1997 survey have master's degrees.<br />This book does not explain how to do indexing... although it does list books and courses where you can get that kind of instruction. Instead, as its title suggests, it focuses on the business aspect.<br />There's information about how to find indexing jobs, decide on billing, and select the equipment you need to get started. There are indexing agreements (designed by the American Society of Indexers) that you can take directly from the book and modify for use with your indexing business. Because the vast majority of indexers work from home, there are also tips for how to continue working full-time, while running your indexing business part-time out of your den. <br />I liked the survey section of the book the most because it reveals a lot about the standard practices of indexers... how they bill for their work, how they handle billing issues, how often they work, and how much they make. The survey also includes demographic information.<br />My only problem with this book is its price. There is some excellent information and it may be difficult to find it elsewhere, given that indexing will probably never experience the popularity of day trading or web design. However, this is a *thin* little book, and there is a chunk of space devoted to some *very* general suggestions on how to set up your business. Some of it just seems like common sense.	2001-10-20

I think this is an excellent book to start out with because it is Jung's telling of his life's story.<br />Jung explains his early questions about God, his deep curiosity with the human mind, his work with psychotherapy and dreams analysis, and his fascination with the unconscious--which would eventually put him on the path to his life's work.<br />Through this book, you can see how Jung developed his ideas and you can get a feeling of the passion that he experienced as he made his discoveries. This sense of development is especially helpful because it will lay down a solid foundation for later readings of his other works (such as his collection of lectures that were published in the Bollingen series).<br />It will also help when you're reading other books about Jung that are not written by Jung. For the past 20 years or so, it has become quite popular to toss around the word 'Jungian'... almost making it a junk adjective like 'psychic' or 'cosmic'... There is a fair amount of misunderstanding about Jung's work. Even within the Jung Institute, you'll find some differences of opinion.<br />For these reasons, the best place to start is with what Jung *actually* said. Also, if you have a basic knowledge of psychological terminology, this book is fairly easy reading.	2001-09-29

Although the book is written for children, you might enjoy reading it after your child has finished with it. One of my favorite stories is about the family of cannibals living in a cave in Galloway, Scotland during the period of King James VI (1566-1625). The book also mentions lesser-known nature facts, such as the orchids that can grow underground, and the world's largest earthworms that can grow to 16ft in length. An interesting read!	2001-08-26

The authors explain the details very well, drawing upon lots of interesting examples of caves from around the world and providing useful illustrations, charts, and photographs throughout the book.<br />In the section on limestone formations, they explain why most limestone caves have been formed by slowly moving water in a thin horizontal zone directly below the water table. They examine scallop formations, carbon dioxide content, calcite solubility and other factors. (Sandstone caves, sea caves and lava tubes are covered just briefly.)<br />There is some good coverage about water movement through caves, the growth of speleotherms, and how to date caves and cave deposits. There is a table provided that lists the secondary minerals found in limestone caves and the caves they can be found in. You will also learn about cave temperatures, relative humidity, and how different karst formations are related to the nature and distribution of the soil in different climatic zones. <br />There is also a section about the many cave dwelling micro-organisms, troglobites, and vertebrates. It explains their evolution, adaptation to the cave environment, and how they fit into the food chain.	2001-08-15

Through the many color photographs, you will learn how to spot specific types of furniture and get a better idea of which company might have manufactured a specific piece. <br />One of the topics addressed early in the book is the use of veneer. The authors explain that 'veneer' doesn't have to be a dirty word and that even the ancient Egyptians used a form of it. There is a section devoted to the repairing and replacing of veneer. They also provide detailed explanations for such terms as 'burl' and 'pollarding.'  They explain the differences between better- and lesser-quality ('borax') furniture, and a pricelist (1999 values) is also included.	2001-08-08

Beginners can find out how to get started by interviewing immediate and extended family. There is an overview on naming methods, calendar changes, different record types, genealogical sources, and major genealogy libraries in the U.S.<br />This book also provides page-sized copies of popular charts such as Family Group Records and Pedigree charts that can be easily photocopied and used. (My edition included a 16&quot; x 18&quot; tear-out family tree.)<br />Unlike many genealogy books, there is some excellent coverage on how to record family histories and write family biographies. Hartley explains how to publish your work and advises that &quot;Most families who publish a book of genealogy print less than 50 copies.&quot;<br />He also describes the types of materials that you will need (sheet protectors, ink, etc.) to ensure that your records are properly preserved. There is also a section on how to organize activities for family reunions--one of those great venues for gathering genealogical details.<br />The well-organized and easy-to-read format makes it an excellent book choice for younger genealogists too.	2001-08-01

Books	5	9	9	N	N	Excellent resource	This book provides excellent genealogical resources to help you find your European ancestors from Portugal to Greece.<br />Baxter explains some of the considerations that are unique to each country. For example, France has a '100 years law' that limits the information that you can access if an individual's record is within the last 100 years. In Italy, there is a record called the Certificate of Family Genealogy (Certificato dello Stato di Famiglia) that can be especially useful. Research in Scandinavian countries, Wales and some areas of the Netherlands and Germany can be difficult because the surnames often changed with each generation. <br />Some countries receive more or less coverage in this book. For Albania, where most of the church records have been destroyed, there is just a short history. For other countries, there are lists of records, major family names, archives with addresses that you can write to, and information about how records are kept in that country. Often dates are provided indicating when the country first began census and/or church records.<br />Overall, this book has great details!	2001-08-01

Whether you're interested in researching a house's history to start a historic neighborhood society or to aid your genealogical research, you'll find great details here for how to determine the age of a home.<br />The book explains how changes in technology and the American landscape affected home construction. Rooms used to have multiple functions until the Victorian era, when they became more specialized and each room acquired a specific function. Some functional rooms, such as the 'family room' and the garage would not appear until the end of WWII, as a result of the baby boom and increased mobility.  <br />You will learn about common building methods and how homes in specific regions were affected by cultural and environmental influences. <br />There are also interesting anecdotes about unusual discoveries... such as the story about the woman who was puzzled about groove marks in the floor of a room, until she learned that the building had once been a dentist office, and the dentist used to roll the dental chair across the floor in that spot.<br />Each chapter contains a useful bibliography, and the section on finding written records is good too.	2001-08-01

The book conveniently places details about wildlife in the center of the book, and puts the illustrations in the back so that you can do faster lookups.<br />Although I appreciate the emphasis on Eco-travel, I found this book rather disappointing when used as a reference. Some of the birds I saw more than once were not listed at all. There are few illustrations of what the birds look like in flight and there is little about age- or gender-based differences in appearance. Also, although the wildlife coverage is fairly good for reptiles and amphibians, there is very little about marine or plant life.<br />I'm still relatively new to birding, but if I could do it again, I would have paid the additional cost and bought the Stiles and Skutch book.... If you're not a bird watcher and you're just looking for a basic 'wild life' identifier, I would suggest skipping the book, and instead, buying one of those laminated 'bird/wildlife identification' cards that you can find for about $10 in many of the visitor-oriented shops around Costa Rica.	2001-07-03

If you need to learn Flash to complete a project quickly, you'll like this book. It provides a nice visual layout to give you a screen-by-screen walk-through of Flash. Even better, it actually numbers all the steps occurring for each screen. <BR>The book explains how to work with objects, layers, symbols, instances, imported graphics, animation, sound, video, events handling, and other types of interactivity. <BR>I would've preferred that the 'Importing Graphics' section was placed at the beginning, because I rarely build objects *within* Flash. Also, the rollover effects are rather simplistic. There is not enough information about building events-based effects. For example, what if you have several menu buttons and you want each button to show 2 different behaviors when you roll over the button with the mouse? What if you want a more complex animation associated with each of those behaviors? These are common practices, and yet, the book does not go into that level of detail. Still, aside from these shortcomings, this book will probably help you come up to speed quickly on the basics.	2001-06-19

What do they really mean when they do certain things? So, I was pleasantly surprised to find this wonderful little book!  <br />The author explains such behaviors as why dogs wag their tails... why dogs know how long to continue to view another dog as still being a puppy... how dogs develop their hierarchies... and yet, the author doesn't overgeneralize about these behaviors either. He describes the stages of a dog's development from puppy to adult, and he dispels some myths about dog intelligence and dog training.<br />I found the author's attitude very refreshing and I think this is another reason that I enjoyed this book so much. He genuinely likes dogs and he portrays them as the intelligent, emotional, and social creatures that they are.	2001-06-19

If you're a visual learner and you're examples-oriented, then this is the book to get. (If you're not this type of learner, then I would suggest perhaps the Javascript book from Visual Quickstart.)  <br />This book provides basic scripts that you can build (or copy) and add to your web pages. The nice visual layout makes it easy to see and grasp the syntax, and understand how principles are being applied. <br />The script examples cover such fundamentals as adding timers, building arrays, responding to events, and retaining page history (e.g., scripting to go back to a page that had been  previously loaded). These examples make great building blocks for continuing on later to build larger scripts. <br />As other reviewers have commented, this book is also useful as a quick 'look-up' for the casual user. I hesitate to give the book a 5, only because it may not be the best beginner book for other types of learning styles.	2001-06-16

There are even entire libraries specializing on the subject. So where do you begin? <br />Groene provides an excellent launching point by describing the most significant U.S. Civil War references, and he suggests not only where to search but how. <br />He goes into considerable detail on how to use the 128-volume Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies in the War of the Rebellion (OR) reference, and it 31-volume naval counterpart (ORN). He also suggests resources for regimental histories that will help you trace the histories of higher-ranking officers and get information covering everything from the regiment's mustering to the disbanding of its survivors.<br />There's a large section in the book devoted to identifying U.S. Civil War equipment and researching the backgrounds of its owners. Groene shares his own research experiences regarding how a name on a sword or pistol has often lead to the discovery of an interesting chain of events. <br />This book is ideal whether you are a genealogist, a U.S. Civil War historian or a weapons collector.	2001-05-06

A couple has married and they have children, but there are no death records or later marriage records of the children. You suspect that the family has 'moved'--but where? An understanding of U.S. migration patterns by specific groups during specific periods might give you some ideas of where to look.<br />Marilyn Lind's book addresses such patterns of migration and settlement, beginning with the colonies' earliest immigrants and continuing to present day--with the greatest coverage being in the 1700s and 1800s. <br />Immigration in the 1700s was often affected by religious persecution in Europe. There were the practices of indentured servitude and slavery as well. She describes how immigration dropped off after the Revolutionary War, and then details the momentum westward in the 1800s and the factors that contributed to it. <br />Early migration is described for each state. However, if you're looking for a lot of detail on a specific state, you might want to look for books specific to that region.  <br />Lind's book provides some coverage of Native American migration and shows the different tribes among the states. You will also find maps showing how boundaries were affected by treaties, cessions, and the forcible removal of the Native Americans to reservations. <br />There is even mention of the orphan trains where nearly 100,000 children from New York City were relocated in the west between 1853 and 1929.<br />If you're researching ancestors in the U.S. and you're trying to follow their movements into other states and regions, this book can help. <br />My only disappointment with the book is that it's not bound very well, and this is the only reason I give it 4 stars. Like many genealogy books, particularly the more regional books that have smaller circulations, it is a simple spiral-bound book with pages that appear to be of a 'photocopy' quality. The maps and drawingsare all black-and-white line art. Still, the content is excellent and it's well worth overlooking the binding.	2001-05-06

It has a nice visual layout and it addresses both Windows and Linux users. You'll find a great walk-through for building scripts that do the following: generate messages to HTML pages, work with system variables, connect to a database (MySql), create/modify/delete tables and records for the database, work with cookies, and more. <br />There's no fluff in this book. It does not waste your time explaining normalization or database design. (If you need to learn about those things, then get a book about databases.) Also, I liked seeing all the references placed neatly in the back of the book, instead of sprinkled distractingly throughout the lesson examples.<br />The only thing I saw missing was a comment that could have been made about the .php file extension. (Throughout the book, .php is used. However, some host providers (like mine!) use PHP3 and this requires giving your files a .php3 extension instead.)<br />Overall though, the book is excellent. My goal was to build a shopping cart that would work with a database. By using this book, I was able to build the table and record creation scripts very quickly. If you're a master programmer, you might find the book too easy. However, I appreciated the clarity and ease in which the content was delivered, and I think most beginners will appreciate it as well.	2001-04-14
