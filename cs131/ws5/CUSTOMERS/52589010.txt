Ellis Davidson has done a fabulous job in this book, where she illustrates a number of critial simularities and differences between what we currently understand of pre-Christian Celtic religion and pre-Christian Scandinavian religion.<br />I was constantly surprised and challenged as I worked my way through this book and experienced a number of my preconcieved notions of both Celtic mythology and Norse mythology being deconstructed and reassembled.<br />And, I felt, for a book mostly intended for a University Library, that it was a pleasant and entertaining read.	2001-08-01

His system of rune magick is a complete system and well researched--though, for rune purists, be warned, his system is presented with a Thelemic bent with frequent references to Liber AL.  My point here is that if you are looking for a system that is more authentically Germanic, then check out the work of Edred Thorsson or Freya Aswynn.  <br />For me this integration works, in part because his context is very contemporary (so for you Thelemites who are looking to explore the runes, here's the book for you).<br />And, for anyone just looking for a great book on magick, this is definately one to check out.	2001-08-01

True to the amoral nature of Chaos Magick, Nick Hall has exceeded the limitations of mainstream ethics.  And true to amorality, he does it in matter-of-fact manner that neither shocks nor comforts the reader.  This book was written by a master of the art.<br />Mr. Hall's presenation of his magickal principals are at once simply and eloquently stated and immmensely practical.  This work is not your run of the mill &quot;contact you holy guardian angel&quot; tripe, it is a practical manual of post-modern sorcery.  I respect most is the cander with which he discusses subject matter that is normally taboo in more mainstream occult literature.	2001-08-01

The formatting is encylcopedic.<br />In many ways it is much the same old standard beasties AD&amp;D players have come to love.<br />However, some new and exciting differences.  PC stats for each monster which is definately a positive innovation.  Temlpated monsters is also great (so how about that 41st level Red Dragon Cleric/Sorcerer?).  Also, the critters in this book can get a little more challenging then in the previous books.  It's nice to that ancient red dragons aren't going to be slaughtered in a matter of seconds by a well organized team of 5th level gnomes.<br />Since it is the third core rule book of the 3rd edition.

Contained in this Grimoire is the basis of Crowley's system.<br />This book was the only grimoire of its kind (most of the others focused on Goetia and other &quot;base&quot; or &quot;lesser&quot; magics).<br />I highly reccomend it.	2000-11-10

The third time is a charm.<br />Being one of those old, long ago, players of AD&amp;D, I found the 3rd Edition Player's Handbook a gift from on high.<br />In recent years I felt that TSR's mismanagement of the Dungeon's and Dragon's system cost the game it's masterful flavor and feel that sparked the game's initial popularity.<br />Under Wizards, the game has finally been re-worked, by players for players.  The result is a modification of the D&amp;D gaming system that eliminates much of the games mechanical unworkability, and put imagination and creativity back into the hands and minds of the players and the DM.<br />The 3rd edition system removes many of the 2nd edition's insipid changes that cost the game much of its original audience (we didn't just grow up, we played other, better games).<br />This new system elegantly recreates the original flavor of the game while packaging it in a well put together system.  Also, ... it comes in at a better price than most other RPG's on the market.	2000-10-27

One for the material in the book, the other for the CD.  Freya Aswynn is to be highly commended for her work in this area which is a blend of scholastic research and soul searching.  There are some aspects that differ from a purely academic approach to Runelore and Northern Magic, but the book also illustrates the powerful results from this sort of magio-spiritual work which is rooted in academia and made manifest through personal experience.<br />The CD is chilling and awsome in the recital of the Havamal and vibration of the runes.
