Constantly being monotored by a telescreen, he cannot do anything against the government, or the thought police will arrest him.  His little hidden betrayals to the Party soon  transform into a conspiracy.  He knows inside him some day he will be  caught and killed.  Winston knows the Party is wrong, but cannot prove it.  Maybe he is wrong, and the Party is right?  The book is wonderful, and  could very well open your eyes to what the government could be doing behind  our backs. Winston is led to believe that he has a memory disorder that  causes him to believe events that never happened have happened. The reader  is led to believe that Winston is right, and is perfectly sane. Some  slogans that seem to be oxymorons make perfect sense.  &quot;WAR IS  PEACE&quot;  &quot;FREEDOM IS SLAVERY&quot; and &quot;IGNORANCE IS  STRENGTH&quot; are a few. This book will have a very big impact on you, and  your view of the world.	2000-02-17

The Russians try to create a new  country devoted to themselves, and the Americans try to stop them. The  spaced based laser(sbr) must work for the Americans to win. I would only  recomend this book if you know something about the military and space. If  not you might not really understand the book. The weapons are somewhat  realistic as well as the people. This book also shows the special something  that all of the great books have.	2000-02-17

The Caliph of Baghdad sends a court member named Ahmad Ibn Fadlan to deliver a message to the King of Bulgars. During his journey, Fadlan stays at a Viking village. Then  a lone warrior comes from the North and tells of a terror that kills the  Vikings in the night under the cover of night and the mist. Fadlan is then  enlisted to fight this horror, against his will. He protests, but to no  avail. He journeys to the North with 12 other warriors to Rothgar's Kingdom  and helps to defend it form the attacks by the barbaric mist warriors.  Then, the group goes on the offensive to slay the mother.        <br />      Ibn Fadlan makes this book more interesting and fun to read because he is  the total opposite of the Vikings, with whom he stays. He is apalled by  their barbaric customs because he is a civilized Arab and the Norsemen are  uncivilized. Throughout the story these contrasts are evident. This book  proceeds without talking about one subject for too long. I never got bored  and there is never a break in the action. The suspense also never stops. I  would definitely recommend this book because it gives a great look into the  Viking culture while being very entertaing. You won't be able to put it  down. Crichton's writing is very fast paced, so this is a great read on a  good subject.	2000-02-17

This autobiography takes you along Joseph Horn's journey  through Europe and many different concentration camps. He faced death  several times and there were times when he'd rather have been dead than  alive and suffering. When all the Jews were liberated, he moved to the  States. He had to learn how to start over and make a living with few  friends and no direct family living. I can assure you that you will not  forget such an experience like this one and will learn to teach others of  this unfortunate disaster. Knowledge was one concept Horn kept, and  hopefully we can all gain more knowledge and use it wisely just like Joseph  did, not too long ago! Horn's most interesting aspect was definitely his  courage. When you're facing danger, it's hard to act quickly and maturely.  Yet, Joseph Horn did this without a problem. Courage is a characterisitic  that does not come easily to most people, but Horn demonstrates this  several times. To go through the death defying situations that Horn went  through, it is evident that courage is needed. Horn was very lucky and  benefited from having this important quality that he took with him through  life. I highly recommend this book to all young adults and their parents.  It's a great book that should be shared with people all around the country.  It is very powerful and can be very graphic, so if you're not good at  handling these details, then maybe it's not such a good idea. But, we could  all learn a lot from Joseph Horn and his story. Regardless of religion,  race, or ethnic background, this book should be read by all. If there were  only more people with Joseph's courage, strength, wisdom, and compassion,  the world would be a better place.	2000-02-17

Most teenage girls do not think that they could be or would be raped. That is exactly what Nancy thought, until it happened to Nancy. One night Nancy was at a concert, tripped and had an asthma attack. That's when the  wonderful and charming Collin came along and saved her, or so she thought.  The night came when she could be alone with Collin in her house. That  night, Collin got her drunk and forced Nancy in her mother's bed. Although  Nancy was screaming and crying, no one was there to help her and Nancy was  raped. About three months after Nancy was raped, she was infected with the  HIV-AIDS virus. Nancy was a very brave and special teenager who battles her  way throught the HIV-AIDS virus with a weekened immune system. The one  thing that is noticed in the book is Nancy's emotions. In her diary she  tells about all of her feelings and her point of view on many subjects. It  Happened To Nancy is a book that can change people's decisions on how they  act as a teenager or a young adult. This book helps you to realize how  serious rape is. Rape can not only hurt or change a person's life, but it  can kill someone as well. This book is very emotional and touching, and  would be enjoyed by someone who like to read about true stories on peoples'  lives.	2000-02-17

Through the stories, Mandy puts the mysterious  pieces of her family's past together. Mandy's personality traits bring out  the best in her.  She is extremely brave, independent, and a one-of-a kind.   She is also not afraid of challanges. Jeanette Ingold, the author of the  story, describes her qualities so that you could actually feel like you  were in the story.  I would definatly recommend this story to others,  especially to young girls.  The story has strong messages about the value  of life and about friendship.  It was the kind of story that many could  relate to.  It never dragged on like most books to, and I couldn't put it  down.  I truly enjoyed the story and I think many others would too.	2000-02-17

The hobbit saves his friends many times from  horrible situations and in the end there is a large battle and a winner  emerges.  Bilbo, the main character, is an intelligent, but frightened  hobbit who turns out to be a hero in the end of the book.  I would  definitely recommend this book to someone who is interested in magical  journeys and far away places.  It had a funny beginning, interesting  characters and a happy ending.  The book overall was very good and is one  of my favorites.  The book makes you feel like you are right in the middle  of their journey with Bilbo.

The book explains how Bill Gates was introduced to computers at the young age of 13 (a rarity in 1969).  He also practicly designed software for an  entire computer terminal at age 13 1/2.  Bill's obsession carried him  through grade school and then through high school.  Eventually, he got into  Harvard University.  While in Harvard he designed more advanced software  for a brand new computer he saw in a magazine.  When Bill tried to give his  software to various companies they rejected him.  Discouraged, Gates  dropped out of Harvard after his sophomore year.  After dropping out he  decided to star his own company.  Perhaps you have heard of it, the most  successful homemade software company in the world, Microsoft.<br />Bill Gates  is obviously the most important character in the book.  He is a persistent  and determined man.  He is very bright, and his life revolves completely  around computers.  Because of Gate's hard work, he is one of the wealthiest  men in the world.<br />I would recommend this book to everyone.  I feel that  people can easily relate to this wonderful story.  The theme is, when you  have a goal, you can reach it with work, and lots of it.  This definitely  applies to everyday life.  Although Bill is a billionaire, he still handles  himself like a normal person.  Bill Gates is classy, intelligent, and  respectable.  He is truly quite a man!	2000-02-17

Cyberpunk covers in full detail, an  accurate account of three individuals who have forever changed computers  and how they are used.  The most interesting story that is told in this  book is the one of Kevin Mitnick, a self-proclaimed computer addict.   Cyberpunk describes Kevin, and how he could manipulate both people and  machines to make them give him information he really shouldn't have had.   It tells in-depth accounts of how this chubby, persistent hacker did it,  why he did it, and when he did it.  Personally as a technologically  informed person, I found this book very interesting and fun to read.  It  seemed as though this would be a hacker's history book.  Sadly this book  did not make it onto and selected reading lists, but this happened with  justification.  This book is not for everyone, it is hard to understand the  technical terms, and someone that is ill informed would be lost in a  second.  To me this book was a great read, and it was hard to put down.  I  definately recommend reading it if you are slightly knowledgeable about  computers.  Overall Katie Hafner and John Markoffs Cyberpunk is a  wonderfully written book, and worth every penny.	2000-02-17

If your parents were divorced and you haven't seen your mom or dad in at least 8  years, don't you ever stop to think what might have happened to them?  In  Terri's case, she should answer this question with a &quot;yes.&quot;  She  was too young at the time to realize the fact that her very own loving  father had kidnapped her from her mother.  He lied to her and said her  mother had died in a car crash when she really was alive and well.  When  Terri gets older, she realizes she doesn't own one picture of her mother,  her father never talks about her, and she doesn't even have her own birth  certificate!  This is where the tension really starts to build up in the  book because then she starts asking her dad questions.  She does find out  that her father did lie to her and that she needs to get in touch with her  mother.  She gets her mother's number and goes and visits her across the  country.  She had never beeen happier to know that she had both of her  parents alive.  Her only other conflict was the fact that she had to make  the choice to live either with her mother or father.  She picked her father  for good reasons.  This book brought tears to my eyes.  I enjoyed it.	2000-02-17

I thought this book required too much thinking.  I like reading books that are easily read and interesting.  I found this book very long and never ending.  I found the  books wording very simplistic.  It did not catch my attention.  At times I  had to read a sentence 3 or 4 times.  There was no really clear plot.  I  believe the only reason it made some top lists was because it was very  suspensful.  Though I did not like the book, at times I would be at the  edge of my chair wanting to find out what will happen.  The book is  basically about a man named Easy Rawlins, that is hired to find a woman  named Daphne Monet.  She got a hold of pictures that could destroy a  mayoral election for a canidate named Mr. Teran.  From that point on the  story became confusing.  The man that hired Easy is named Mr. Albright.  He  Hires Easy because he needs someone to frame for his murders he has  commited.  Easy soon finds out what is going on and takes matters into his  own hands.  I would only recommend this book for people who love all kinds  of twists and turns in the plot.	2000-02-17

Ernest J. Gaines, himself growing up in a similar setting, makes his  novel very realistic.  He bases most of his novels on real life experiences  from his youth. This book takes place in the late 1930's in Louisiana.  A  black man named Jefferson was said to be guilty for killing a white man- a  crime he did not commit.  Mr. Wiggins, the teacher at the colored church  elementary, is asked by Jefferson's godmother to go visit him in jail.  In  court, Jefferson was called a &quot;hog&quot;, and not a man.  Jefferson's  godmother, Miss Emma, wanted Mr. Wiggins to teach Jefferson ,before he is  executed, that he is a man.  The two men grow a relationship, and Jefferson  is eventually able to express his feelings by writing to Mr. Wiggins in a  journal. Jefferson is a very honest person, and you really feel like you  know him at the end.  That is the thing I liked most about the book, it is  very realistic. I feel that this is one of the best books I have ever read,  and reccomend it to anyone who does not mind a little sadness.	2000-02-17

His mother is the  daughter of the king of part of Wales.  No one knows where or who his  father is, except for Merlin's mother, who won't tell anyone.  Merlin's  grandfather is allied with the High King of Greater Britain.  In the story  Melrin runs from his home in fear of being killed by his uncle and to-be  king Camlach.  He flees to Less Britain and there finds out who his father  is, and what his purpose for living really his.  Merlin is arguably the  most intriguing character.  He is very solitary, as a boy and an adult,  seeking no company from anyone except his personal servant.  His most  fascinating aspect his his ability to manipulate people, even without  magic.  In some circumstances he acquired help from God, using magic to  cinvince people into doing what he wanted.  Most fantasy fans would like  this book.  Merlin is always an interesting person to read about and has  had many books written about him.  His childhood is mysterious, though, and  many people would like to find out about it.  This book talks about his  childhood, and how it affected his life.  The only part of the book I  didn't like is the extensive description of the landscapes and settings.   If you like a lot of description, though, then this book is for you.	2000-02-17

In Dessina, the school Kari and Shawna attend, black's and white's do not date each other or  attend the South Ball, their school's famous dance, together.  Kari and  Shawna had never been friends because of Kari having white skin and being  popular as opposed to Shawna's black skin and a different group of friends.   When they find out their parents had dated in the past, they become  friends, feeling they share a secret.  Kari's popular friends object to  this, because Shawna wrote an article in the school newspaper implying that  black's and white's should be able to attend the South Ball together.   Shawna suggests that maybe their parents had a baby together, and that is  why they both seem to have disappeared during their Senior Year.  Together,  the two teens drive to Tennessee, where Kari's mom had moved, to find out  more.  When they find out that her mom had to move just because of people  feeling hatred towards their mixed race relationship, Kari and Shawna  realize how much they have to share.  When a similar relationship breaks  out at their school, everyone realizes how much black and white  relationships have to go through.  Kari and Shawna now share a friendship  understanding this.

I thought this book required too much thinking.  I like reading books that are easily read and interesting.  I found this book very long and never ending.  I found the  books wording very simplistic.  It did not catch my attention.  At times I  had to read a sentence 3 or 4 times.  There was no really clear plot.  I  believe the only reason it made some top lists was because it was very  suspensful.  Though I did not like the book, at times I would be at the  edge of my chair wanting to find out what will happen.       The book is  basically about a man named Easy Rawlins, that is hired to find a woman  named Daphne Monet.  She got a hold of pictures that could destroy a  mayoral election for a canidate named Mr. Teran.  From that point on I  can't explain what happened because I really didn't follow the story.  I  would only recommend this book for people who love all kinds of twists and  turns in the plot.	2000-02-17

There is a doctor trying to escape from Germany.  He gets on a submarine and brings a large coffin.  On their way out of the country, they get attacked and sin k.  In 1996, a  photographer goes on a deep-sea dive to take pictures.  Before the surface,  they see the sunken U-boat.  They go over and lift the coffin on to the  boat.  The man opens the coffin, which lets the creature escape.  Simon  Chase owns the Osprey Island Marine Institute.  On the small island people  start getting killed mysteriously.  The people on the island realize the  importance of killing this creature and intend to do it.    I would  recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good sci-fi horror novel.  It is  somewhat gory and scary.  It will keep you on your toes.  If you liked  Peter Benchley's &quot;Jaws&quot; then you will like this.  It is a good,  thrilling story that you wont  want to put down.	2000-02-17

For instance, teens growing up all face difficult and confusing problems and sometimes feel as though they have no one to talk to or that  no one can understand what they are going through. In reading &quot;Kissing  Doorknobs&quot;, you understand that there are people out there that can  help you and will listen and care. The book was about a girl named Tara  growing up with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and being confused because  she didn't know what she was suffering from. She finally found out what it  was and found the strength and courage to defeat the &quot;tyrants&quot; in  her head. If you were reading this book and had Obsessive Compulsive  Disorder,then it might help you find the courage and strength, just like  Tara, to defeat this terrifying disease.	2000-02-17

Tolkien tells the story of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins.  He is forced to join a group of dwarves on a quest to reclaim their families' ancient treasure from the evil dragon Smaug.  It is  a dangerous journey and during the quest it is Bilbo who saves the dwarves  on more than one occasion and finds Smaug's weak spot to get back the  dwarves' treasure.  Although at the beginning of the story Bilbo does not  believe he can achieve the dwarves' expectations, he ends up surpassing  them.  Bilbo becomes the unlikely hero of the group after many an example  of his courage and ability to perform under pressure.  The Hobbit is a  wonderful adventure, fantasy novel which appeals to all ages.  It can be  read as a straight adventure story by younger readers, or as a more moral  story by the older reader.  Tolkien has tried to ask a question of the  reader: would they rather sit at home and do nothing and have a quiet  existance, or go out into the world, get involved and make a difference.  I  would recommend this book to anyone who has a love of exciting, fantasy and  adventure stories.  Although The Hobbit is around seventy years old, the  underlying themes of the book are ageless.	2000-02-17

This autobiography takes you along Joseph Horn's journey  through Europe and many different concentration camps. He faced death  several times and there were times when he'd rather have been dead than  alive and suffering. When all the Jews were liberated, he moved to the  States. He had to learn how to start over and make a living with few  friends and no direct family living. I can assure you that you will not  forget such an experience like this one and will learn to teach others of  this unfortunate disaster. Knowledge was one concept Horn kept, and  hopefully we can all gain more knowledge and use it wisely just like Joseph  did, not too long ago! Horn's most interesting aspect was definitely his  courage. When you're facing danger, it's hard to act quickly and maturely.  Yet, Joseph Horn did this without a problem. Courage is a characterisitic  that does not come easily to most people, but Horn demonstrates this  several times. To go through the death defying situations that Horn went  through, it is evident that courage is needed. Horn was very lucky and  benefited from having this important quality that he took with him through  life. I highly recommend this book to all young adults and their parents.  It's a great book that should be shared with people all around the country.  It is very powerful and can be very graphic, so if you're not good at  handling these details, then maybe it's not such a good idea. But, we could  all learn a lot from Joseph Horn and his story. Regardless of religion,  race, or ethnic background, this book should be read by all. If there were  only more people with Joseph's courage, strength, wisdom, and compassion,  the world would be a better place.	2000-02-17

Narrative chapters tell the story line. The second kind of chapter consists of Susanna's interpertation of what was taking place in the hospital. The  third style of chapter lets the reader understand Susanna while she  discusses ideas in depth. The plot of the story is easy to follow.  After a  series of events that make Susanna a possible danger to herself, she is  sent to a mental hospital. At the hospital, Susanna makes friends easily,  and she uses a humorous style to describe events. Humor derives from the  fact that her experiences are often so disturbing that it is easier for one  to laugh than to cry.  By the end of the novel, Susanna is able to leave  the hospital with a new understanding of life.  The story allows the reader  to feel as if they have gone throught the experience with Susanna.  It lets  the reader understand how many of the characters feel. It also lets the  reader grow with the characters and understand the changes they undergo.  The reader becomes part of the world Ms. Kaysen creates out of her eal life  experience.  I would recommend this book for a couple of reasons.  It is  non-fiction; while reading about the hectic life in the hospital one is  confronted by its basis in truth and the story becomes one that can be  related to ones own life. The story is full of life, changes, and  challenges making it an essential read for anyone who is captivated by the  human mind.	2000-02-17

It is about a man who fights in world war II, thru one of the most dangerous bombings of the war. The fire bombing of Dresden. The book describes the life of Billy Pilgrim a youth who grows up  in a small town and becomes a Optometrist.  The book goes thou his entire  life going into detail on his time as a P.O.W. in WWII. Before the story  Kurt speaks very well on his anti war thoughts. My favorite character in  this book is Billy pilgrim,although Billy is very girl like and fragile he  toughs it out and survives some of the hardest periods of WWII. My favorite  part of this story is when Billy speaks about he was unstuck in time, it  gives him the ability to spontaneously travel to other times in his life.  He never remembers where he has just been. But he knows he has the ability  to travel thru time.  I would recomend this book to any one who enjoys  historical fiction or science fiction books.

At the beginning a pig named Old Major gives the rest of the animals on the farm the idea to revolt against  the humans running the  farm.  Old Major soon dies in an accident, but his memory doesn't, and the  animals conduct the revolt.  It's succesful!  The pigs immediately are  recognized as the leaders of the farm.  There are two major pigs  that  never agree on anything, their names are Snowball and Napoleon.  One day  the two pigs are in a heated argument over whether or not to build a  windmill.  Napoleon sees that the animals will vote for Snowball's idea to  build it, so Napoleon chases him off the farm.  It then becomes a  communistic enviroment where everyone slaves away in the fields all day and  barely get enough rations to live, except for the pigs.  By the end of the  book Snowball is used as a scapegoat for every little thing piece of bad  fortune.  By the end of the book the other animals can't tell the  difference between the humans and the Pigs.  This book is very  interesting and very good. I would definitely reccomend it.  One great  thing about the book is that the characters are all animals.  Napoleon is  very interesting, because even though he's a pig he teaches himself how to  read, write, and trains himself in architecture and battle tactics.  If you  want to read a book that will leave you saying, &quot;Whoa,&quot; or if you  just want to read a great book Animal Farm is for you.	2000-02-17

From this title, you probably wouldn't think that I liked this book.  In fact, I liked it a little bit too much (I didn't say that).  See, being the captain of the football and the wrestling team, it is pretty hard to keep my &quot;tough guy&quot; image while being  seen reading a book such as Harry Potter.  The story is about a little boy,  Harry, whose parents died, and he is sent to live with his Aunt and Uncle.  Harry is not a normal boy though, he is a wizard, and if there is one thing  that his aunt and uncle hates, its anything to do with wizardry.  He is  treated terribly and he is forced to live in a dark cabinet under the  stairs.  Harry escapes though, with the help of Hagrid, a groundskeeper at  Hogwarts, a school for wizardry, which is where Harry was to be going.  At  Hogwarts, Harry meets friends and has many adventures, including one that  puts him face to face with the evil dark lord that killed his parents, and  he found that the reason why he was able to survive from the attack of this  villian was because of the love that his mother showed for him, as she died  trying to protect him from danger.  After I finished the first book, I had  to read all three.  I was reading them day and night, and this prevented me  from sleeping and even doing homework.  Yes of course I would recommend  this to someone else.  This book has everything, from killing and dark evil  to savage beasts, and maybe when you get into the later books, you might  see a touch of romance, all with that little dose of magic mixed in.	2000-02-17

The Caliph of Baghdad sends a court member named Ahmad Ibn Fadlan to deliver a message to the King of Bulgars. During his journey, Fadlan stays at a Viking village. Then  a lone warrior comes from the North and tells of a terror that kills the  Vikings in the night under the cover of night and the mist. Fadlan is then  enlisted to fight this horror, against his will. He protests, but to no  avail. He journeys to the North with 12 other warriors to Rothgar's Kingdom  and helps to defend it form the attacks by the barbaric mist warriors.  Then, the group goes on the offensive to slay the mother.        <br />      Ibn Fadlan makes this book more interesting and fun to read because he is  the total opposite of the Vikings, with whom he stays. He is apalled by  their barbaric customs because he is a civilized Arab and the Norsemen are  uncivilized. Throughout the story these contrasts are evident. This book  proceeds without talking about one subject for too long. I never got bored  and there is never a break in the action. The suspense also never stops. I  would definitely recommend this book because it gives a great look into the  Viking culture while being very entertaing. You won't be able to put it  down. Crichton's writing is very fast paced, so this is a great read on a  good subject.	2000-02-17

Set on a small island of Japanese and white settlers just after WWII, the story follows the trial of Japanese  fisherman Kabuo Miyamoto.  Accused of killing another white fisherman,  Kabuo's neighbors one by one begin to turn against him.  Woven throughout  the trial are the countless retellings of personal events which occured on  the island up to the present.  Through these, the breathtaking love of two  people, a Japanese girl and a white boy, and how they were torn apart is  exposed.  Now grown up, Hatsue has moved on and married Kabuo, but Ishmael  is still pining the loss.  As the trial pursues, Ishmael slowly pulls away  the layers of anger and cynicism from his emotions and he is left with who  he is, a man whose heart and soul was destroyed by a community not willing  to accept the different.  Touching and emotional, Snow Falling On Cedars is  an amazing example of the destruction path that prejudice leaves.	2000-02-17

Cyberpunk covers in full detail, an  accurate account of three individuals who have forever changed computers  and how they are used.  The most interesting story that is told in this  book is the one of Kevin Mitnick, a self-proclaimed computer addict.   Cyberpunk describes Kevin, and how he could manipulate both people and  machines to make them give him information he really shouldn't have had.   It tells in-depth accounts of how this chubby, persistent hacker did it,  why he did it, and when he did it.  Personally as a technologically  informed person, I found this book very interesting and fun to read.  It  seemed as though this would be a hacker's history book.  Sadly this book  did not make it onto and selected reading lists, but this happened with  justification.  This book is not for everyone, it is hard to understand the  technical terms, and someone that is ill informed would be lost in a  second.  To me this book was a great read, and it was hard to put down.  I  definately recommend reading it if you are slightly knowledgeable about  computers.  Overall Katie Hafner and John Markoffs Cyberpunk is a  wonderfully written book, and worth every penny.	2000-02-17

It was a beautifully done book, with many great aspects of it.  It involves the boy Gerald who in my opinion is a very strong hearted boy.  He had to stand up  for what he thought, and what he thought was wrong.  He was abused by his  step-father, and he protected his little sister by taking the abuse aimed  towards her.  I thought he was very brave for doing this.  This book has  some mature subjects discussed, but overall, it was a very well done book.   I recommend it to anyone who wants to read a book that is very powerful,  and covers subjects that you may be uncomfortable with, but it's great.  I  am definitely going to read some more selections that were written by this  author, Sharon M. Draper!  I am very impressed with this book, and I  definitely hope you enjoy it as much as I did.  Get ready for a good  book!	2000-02-17

He lives in a closet, and is ignored. His horrible life changes when letters literally &quot;flood&quot; into his  life. He was excepted into Hogwart's school of wizardry. It is then that  the magical world, which lies behind ours, is explained. Harry also learns  that an evil wizard, Voldemort, killed his parents. He did make a best  friend, though. Soon he would make another. These three would stick  together in good and bad. However, while sneaking about, they find out  about a hidden source of supreme power: Nicholas Flammel's sorcerer's  stone. Eventually, Harry finds out Voldemort is trying to regain life with  it. Through wits, bravery, and smarts, the three friends save the stone and  keep Voldemort from turning the world evil.   The author developed the  school and characters to perfection. Suspense fills each and every chapter.  Finally, you don't have to wait until pg. 100 to find the hook, it is  tright there at pg. 1. I must say, for a kid who hates ALL books, I think I  found a success! I would recommend this book without a pause. This is  probably the best book I have ever read. Don't read it because it is  recommended, read it because you want to read the best book you have ever  read! Usually, I have to put a pleasure reading book down by Ch. 2, but  this book kept me hooked all the way along. I have never seen a plot  developed so perfectly, and characters I could relate so much too. If you  don't read this because you want a good book, at least read it so you can  know what you would have missed!	2000-02-17

This is a heartfelt emotional story about a sophmore girl named Patrice Latta being noticed by a senior named Lance Carter. Lance makes a bet with his friends that he would get this girl to commit fornication, and this  story is about what happens when she fornicates and gets pregnant. She  can't go out because people stare at her and she is embarressed. Then,  Lance gets engaged to another girl that summer and Patrice's heart breaks.  She doesn't have an abortion because she doesn't want to destroy the last  link she had to her love. I believe that this is a wonderful novel, and it  is totally heartfelt. It is a presentable novel to young Americans today.	2000-02-17

Some of his assumptions are wrong (such as the fact that a large portion in Latin) The Latin isn't really a problem, however; the important  parts are mostly translated and the rest is only supplementary. There is a  delicate balance of humor and realism that makes the story wonderful to  read. This is inherently a timeless novel.  We gradually learn that after a  nuclear war, the common people, 'simpletons', blamed the intellectuals for  the destruction, burning books and lynching the learned.  I.E. Leibowitz  rebelled against this and fought to save knowledge, forming an order  devoted to saving knowledge.  The book consists of three novellas, each one  covering less and less time and farther in the future.  Each reveals  something new about the world as it stands then and shows mankind's  advancement.  Miller wrote this when Communist paranoia was high, in the  time of bomb shelters and paranoia.  At the time, it was entirely possible  that a set of explosions could devastate the world; he writes as such.  He  wrote far enough in the future that these situations could still occur,  creating a piece that's universally accepted.  Sadly, he died of a  self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head in 1997. This book requires a  fairly large chunk of time invested to read but certainly pays off.  It  many good points about mankind and our nature while remaining readable and  is very well written, making it one of the best pieces of science fiction  I've ever read.  If you have the time, you should read this book.	2000-02-17

He starts off with 12 dwarfs and one mysterious old wizard.  He meets dangerous animals and is almost attacked  and killed by wood elves.  The hobbit saves his friends many times from  horrible situations and in the end there is a large battle and a winner  emerges.  Bilbo, the main character, is an intelligent, but frightened  hobbit who turns out to be a hero in the end of the book.  I would  definitely recommend this book to someone who is interested in magical  journeys and far away places.  It had a funny beginning, interesting  characters and a happy ending.  The book overall was very good and is one  of my favorites.  The book makes you feel like you are right in the middle  of their journey with Bilbo.  On the other hand if you aren't in to fantasy  books and don't like adventures than this book isn't for you!	2000-02-17

I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read an excellent book.  This was the first John Grisham book I have ever read and I am positive it will  not be my last.  I couldn't put this book down once I started reading it  because it was so wonderful!  This book is definately worth reading.  This  book is about a multi-billionaire who wants to end his life.  He leaves a  testament giving his eleven billion dollar estate to his illegitimate  daughter, Rachel Lane.  His lawyer sends a litigator, Nate, to go find her.   He finds her after many dangerous incidents.  She shows no interest in  signing the document.  Nate returned to Washington to find that he was  appointed as Rachel's lawyer.  It is now Nate's job to find Rachel and find  out what to do with the money.  This is an adventurous, suspenseful novel  which will definately attract you to Grisham's work.  This book not only  grabs your attention with its descriptions, it teaches you about Brazil and  much information on litigation.  This was an excellent book and I would  recommend it to anyone who simply wants to read a great book.	2000-02-17
