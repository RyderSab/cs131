US	52723388	RIT4STZ9KKVYF	0375421734	870198150	Scavenger Hunt: A novel	Books	4	0	0	N	Y	Uneven, Ferrigno has done worse -- but he's done better too	At his best (\\"The Horse Latitudes,\\" \\"Heartbreaker\\"), Robert Ferrigno writes stylish, smart thrillers that evoke film noir as imagined by Quentin Tarantino.  When Ferrigno's not at his best, his novels are uneven and are something like the literary equivalent of stale Cracker Jacks -- still satisfying and the surprise inside may delight you, but you know you've had better.<br />\\"Scavenger Hunt\\" brings back reporter Jimmy Gage (last seen in \\"Flinch\\"), who writes articles for the Hollywood magazine \\"SLAP.\\"  Gage is a street smart tough guy whose moral compass is stronger than his legal compass.  As long as he thinks he's doing the right thing, he's more than willing to bend the rules.  Gage meets former movie director Garrett Walsh, who made a brilliant movie a long time ago, then pled guilty to murdering a high school tart the same day that he met and slept with her.  After serving a 7 year sentence, Walsh is determined to write \\"the most dangerous screenplay,\\" which will explain how he was set up.  He wants Gage to write an article about this.  Gage thinks Walsh is just a loser who pissed away his talent years ago.  But then Walsh ends up face-down in the koi pond of his former house (he was renting a small cabin on the property from the owners), half-eaten by the ravenous fish.  Gage gets interested in figuring things out, especially when the coroner pronounces it an accidental death.<br />The supporting characters are drawn nicely, from the tough-as-nails female detective that everyone is afraid of, the retired cop who busted Walsh seven years ago, Gage's assorted buddies who operate just on this side of the law.<br />So why am I less impressed with this than \\"The Horse Latitudes,\\" which remains in my view Ferrigno's best?  At his best, Ferrigno's writing has a fluidity to it that's almost cinematic.  It has a power that propels the story forward.  In \\"Scavenger Hunt,\\" on the other hand, there's sometimes a disjointedness, as if particular scenes were written because they should be in there.  The best comparison I can think of is between the fight scene in \\"The Horse Latitudes,\\" where Danny DiMedici has to get past a Samoan bodyguard (and uses cooking oil to help grease things, so to speak) versus the fight between Gage and a husband he's angered in \\"Scavenger Hunt.\\"  The former was tight, exciting, and clever; the latter is okay but a bit tired and abrupt.<br />Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed \\"Scavenger Hunt,\\" finishing it in just two nights; and if Ferrigno turns out other novels of this quality, he's well worth reading.  It's just that I know he's capable of better.	2003-02-07

Most of the Xanth books take place in a reasonably well-define timeline that we might call the \\"present.\\"  This actually spans quite a long time, since the main character in Xanth-1, Bink, is 25 years in that book, but around 60 in Xanth-9.  But \\"Crewel Lye\\" takes place **400** years earlier, so it doesn't have the benefit of a lot of the usual Xanthian touches that prop up other books.  (By Xanthian touches, I mean things like finding out how to get into Good Magician Humfrey's castle so as to get an Answer.)<br />Anyway, in the \\"present\\" time, Jordan is a ghost, which means that he died with unresolved issues.  When little Princess Ivy asks what happened, he tells her the story of his demise.  Thus, most of the book is actually narrated in the first-person, which is different from the other Xanth books, and a nice change of pace.  First-person narration forces a writer to be disciplined about observations, thoughts, etc., because only those of one person can be related to the reader.  This is important for this book, because the \\"cruel lie\\" that does Jordan in actually has a different interpretation, one that Jordan doesn't realize, but the reader can figure out.  It makes for a very clever ending, even if it becomes somewhat obvious.<br />Jordan's story -- he is a barbarian who wants an adventure -- is full of action and violence, some intrigue, some romance (or just plain offscreen sex), and even though I was concerned that I wouldn't get to read about the usual Xanth characters, I was engrossed in it.	2003-02-04

Unlike the first two, which focused on Bink, this one focuses on Bink's son, Dor.  Dor is a twelve year old Magician with the power to speak to inanimate objects or the dead -- which is quite useful as a means of gathering information.  When Queen Iris tries to scare him with illusions of dragons or other horrible monsters, Dor is able to ask the floor if the creature is real, and when he's told it's not, he can walk through the illusion without fear.<br />Dor gets sent on a mission to find a way to bring zombie Jonathan back to life as a favor to Millie the maid.  It's tough because Dor has a severe crush on Millie, due partially to the fact that her magic talent is sex appeal(?).  But Millie loves Jonathan.  To find the means to bring Jonathan back to life, Dor has to travel 800 years in the past through a magic tapestry.  <br />Along on the ride is a giant spider named Jumper.  Well, he was normal size in Xanth, but he got transformed into a six foot tall spider in the past.  Disgusting?  Maybe.  But Jumper is incredibly loyal, mature, powerful, and genuine decent.<br />One of the really neat things about \\"Castle Roogna\\" is how well its plot fits in with the previous two novels (\\"A Spell for Chameleon\\" and \\"The Source of Magic\\") -- oddities like the Forget spell around the Gap (no one remembers the Gap) are explained by the end of this book in a satisfying way.	2003-01-23
US	52723388	RXRPBVFMR59T5	0345350588	447211642	Source of Magic (Xanth)	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Very tight, well-plotted and well-detailed fantasy-adventure	As you are probably aware, \\"The Source of Magic\\" is the second book in the Xanth series.  A co-worker turned me on to the series by lending me the sixth book (\\"Night Mare\\"), which led me pick up the first 16 books through an ebay auction.<br />I have heard that, after a while, the Xanth books get repetitive or dull, but \\"The Source of Magic\\" is near the beginning of the series, and everything is fresh and tight.  What do I mean by tight?  Well, the laws of magic in Xanth are well-formed and internally consistent.  Lots of fantasy movies, in particular, do not adhere to internally consistent rules, and as a result, they get annoying.  A prime example is Michael Crichton's \\"Timeline,\\" where he babbles on about quantum theory in an effort to demonstrate that his book is not about time travel; yet, a major plot point could only work if in fact a person traveled back in time.  That's annoying.<br />\\"The Source of Magic\\" (and \\"A Spell for Chameleon,\\" the first Xanth book) are not like that.  They follow the rules, and once you understand the secret about Bink (the main character), you marvel at how well everything fits together.<br />Anyway, this is a classic \\"quest\\" type of story: a group of adventurers -- Bink, a human with a special magical talent; Crombie, a human soldier transformed into a griffin (part-eagle, part-lion); Humfrey, a human Magician; Grundy, a golem; and Chester, a centaur -- go on a mission to find the source of magic in the land of Xanth.  Along the way, they meet a dragon, an ogre, a village of women, a siren and a gorgon (kind of like Medusa), and all sorts of other creatures.  Once they find the source of magic, Bink has to make an awfully difficult ethical and moral choice.<br />Later Xanth books get more and more pun-filled; you see some of them here, such as the desert known as \\"eye scream,\\" made from the eyes of scream birds -- not to be confused with \\"eye smilk.\\"  But apart from the puns, this book is often quite funny, especially since the griffin and the centaur are constantly squabbling against each other.	2003-01-17
US	52723388	R1KGSJ9PZN0AUH	0891906738	189116031	Seawitch	Books	3	17	21	N	N	Good enough to get you hooked on MacLean, but not his best	\\"Seawitch\\" was the first Alistair MacLean book that I ever read, and it was good enough to get me hooked on him.  To my delight, I discovered that most of his earlier books were even better.<br />The plot of \\"Seawitch\\" is a little less convoluted than typical MacLean: Lord Worth, fabulously wealthy and quite ruthless, has made a lot of enemies in the oil business because of his cutthroat attitude.  His drill rig, named Seawitch, will put the final nail in the coffin of his competitors, as it will allow him to drill at will in the ocean.  His competitors decide that while they hate one another, they all hate Lord Worth even more.  So they hire a ruthless \\"troubleshooter\\" to fix their problem.  They don't need to know how, don't even want to know how, they just want it done.<br />Fortunately for Lord Worth, his two daughters (one blonde, one brunette) are in love and loved by two former police detectives/now private investigators.  These two guys are your usual MacLean heroes: tough, resourceful, insubordinate (which is why they are ex-police detectives), hopelessly upright.  From there, it's a cat and mouse game between the two sides to see if Seawitch gets destroyed.  There's a lot of sneaking around, some violence, and a satisfying climax.<br />Still, by 1977, when he wrote \\"Seawitch,\\" MacLean was starting to lose his talent, and after this, his books range from mediocre (\\"Athabasca\\") to dreadful (\\"River of Death\\", \\"Partisans\\").  You would do yourself a favor to go back to read books MacLean wrote between 1959 and 1971, when he kicked out an amazing string of mostly Cold War thrillers, the best of which are \\"Ice Station Zebra,\\" \\"The Golden Rendezvous,\\" \\"The Black Shrike,\\" \\"The Satan Bug,\\" \\"Bear Island,\\" \\"Puppet on a Chain,\\" \\"Where Eagles Dare,\\" and \\"Night Without End.\\"  Those books -- many of which were made into movies -- are tight, tension-filled, unpredictable reads.	2002-12-23
US	52723388	R24EF08YMMAUST	0151008116	843703088	Life of Pi	Books	5	8	10	N	Y	Delightful adventure!!	Novels about animals run the risk of over-anthromorphizing the creatures, which can make the book sappy or manipulative (emotionally speaking).  Yann Martel's \\"Life of Pi\\" manages to craft a story built largely around a 16-year-old boy and a Bengal tiger.  Not a fluffy, Tigger-like companion, but a real-life 500 pound, hungry tiger.  You're stuck with it on a 23 foot long raft in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.  What do you do?<br />Martel packs quite a bit into the book: Are zoos awful places?  How do you tame tigers?  How do you catch fish in the middle of the ocean?  Do animals get seasick?  Can you be a practicing Christian, Hindu, and Muslim at the same time?<br />Not only that, Martel writes with a true wit.  In describing how the main character's dad ended up going from being a hotelkeeper to a zookeeper, Martel writes: \\"In many ways, running a zoo is a hotelkeeper's worst nightmare.  Consider: the guests never leave their rooms; they expect not only lodging but full board. . . .  One has to wait until they saunter to their balconies, so to speak, before one can clean their rooms, and then one has to wait until they tire of the view and return to their rooms before one can clean their balconies; and there is much cleaning to do, for the guests are as unhygienic as alcoholics.\\"<br />The book sparkles with observations like that, making it very difficult to put down.  Once I got into it about a third of the way, I keep reading until I finished it.  And that was while I was on vacation in Las Vegas!	2002-12-05
US	52723388	R2V8WRU6TBX12T	0066214122	245555180	Prey	Books	4	6	9	N	N	Rocking sci-fi/horror, one of his best in a long time	After the dismally pretentious \\"Timeline,\\" Michael Crichton took three years off before coming back with \\"Prey.\\"  And the time off did his writing a lot of good.<br />For the first time since \\"Rising Sun,\\" Crichton writes in the first person, and while his narrator seems little different from, say, the protagonists in \\"Rising Sun\\" or \\"Disclosure\\" (i.e., white male, 35-40, dad), the style works here for a number of reasons.  First, his slowly building suspicions carry you along, propelling you into the narrative.  Second, the reader is not subjected to the pages-long pedantic asides that plagued \\"Timeline\\" (and even \\"Jurassic Park\\").  Of course, there are the techno-touches that make it a Crichton novel, but these are integrated much better into the story.<br />The plot is described well above, and in brief, is as follows: Jack Forman, former Silicon Valley computer programmer, is now a stay-at-home dad while his wife Julia works intense hours at a nanotechnology company.  But Julia is really moody, not to mention, absent much of the time.  She keeps working late, and Jack starts to wonder if she's having an affair.  When she is home, she yells at the kids and at Jack, and then apologizes, only to blow up again later.  Is she cheating on him?  Is she on drugs?  That's only the beginning, as Jack ends up getting called out to the nanotech factory, only to face even worse problems.<br />\\"Prey\\" has something of the feel of a good Dean Koontz novel, like \\"Midnight\\" or \\"Fear Nothing.\\"  In other words, it could be put in the horror section of the bookstore, but isn't really like Stephen King horror.  It's more up the alley of another story about BIG SCIENCE gone bad.	2002-12-05
US	52723388	R2CDX9PUUTTUF8	0802138357	830777031	To the Elephant Graveyard	Books	4	8	9	N	Y	Real life travel/adventure story reads like a novel	As you can tell from my moniker, I am a lover of elephants. So it was with some trepidation that I bought this book (against my wife's advice) to read about a modern version of George Orwell's short story \\"Shooting an Elephant.\\" Here, it seems that a rogue elephant has gone berserk in India and is killing a number of Indians for no apparent reason.<br />The narrator, an AP reporter, catches up with the hunter who has been retained by the local government to kill the elephant. The hunter, Mr. Chowdhury, is, strangely, a lover of animals, especially elephants. There is some nice discussion of why he nevertheless takes tasks like this one.<br />The book takes Hall (the narrator), Chowdhury, and others (mostly elephant riders) on a hunt for the rogue throughout northeastern India. They have a number of interludes, some of which are funny, others tragic, until the final confrontation. Along the way, we learn a bit about why the elephant was going berserk.<br />Hall has a nice, unobtrusive writing style. It's not flashy, and he knows enough to let the narrative momentum carry the book, although he throws in occasional travel- or history-related discussions of the local Indian culture. For example, he recounts the myth of why the Indian god Ganesh has the head of an elephant. (The gods had to replace his head after an accident, and an elephant was the first creature they saw.)<br />I was afraid that I would find this book incredibly sad and painful (see Barbara Gowdy's \\"The White Bone\\"), but instead, it was very saistfying. It's still sad about the rogue elephant, but maybe because it's not as senseless as poaching, the story, while sad, is understandable.	2002-10-30

It's got some annoying typos in the text, but let's face it, you buy books like this one for the pictures. And the pictures are amazing! Some are so up close that a male lion's face fills the entire page. The colors are rich, showing off the lions' fur nicely, or the African landscape.<br />The book is divided into sections on anatomy, social behavior, care of the young, and eating. If you find lion cubs irresistably adorable (as I do), the section on the young will knock you over. I don't know how the authors managed to get so close (even with a telephoto lens) to get some of the shots they did (cub suckling on mom, three cubs climbing up a tree).<br />Typos aside, the text is fine. I learned that lion cubs like to roll around in elephant poop(!).	2002-10-15

In this case, one of the disasters in the past was a comet that struck the Earth about 9000 years ago, causing massive tidal waves and shifting of the continents. Unfortunately for us, the comet had a twin that missed at that time, but that was predicted to come back . . . 9000 years later. Throw in neo-Nazis, nanotechnology, and the remains of an Atlantis-like civilization, and you have the latest Pitt adventure.<br />Prior to \\"Deep Six,\\" Cussler wrote fairly realistic adventure novels -- \\"Raise the Titanic!\\" was as much about the engineering feat of lifting the Titanic from its resting place as it was about an adventure to find an incredibly rare and potent crystal. But starting with \\"Deep Six,\\" Cussler began weaving more and more science fiction/science fantasy into his book: mind control, lunar colonies, artificial intelligence, and so on. \\"Atlantis Found\\" is probably an extreme even for Cussler, and as it turns out the science/fantasy part is the weakest element. To begin with, the comet strike in 7000 BC just is too hard to swallow. Supposedly it wipes out 99 percent of animals and humans through floods and climate changes. But nothing like that remotely happened in real life -- sure, woolly mammoths and sabre-tooth tigers died out, but there's no mass extinction as one would expect.<br />Besides the influx of science fiction, \\"Atlantis Found\\" continues other trends of Cussler's more recent novels: the appearance of numerous recurring characters (Perlmutter, the maritime history expert/gourmand; Congresswoman Smith, Pitt's on-off love interest; more abuse heaped on Rudi Gunn, the second in command of the fictional Nat'l Underwater and Maritime Agency; Yaeger, the computer expert), as well as yet another deus ex machina by the author himself, who has appeared in a number of adventures as an \\"old\\" and \\"grizzled\\" character, sometimes a prospector, sometimes a bartender, etc. It's actually quite bizarre and I'm not sure what to make of it.<br />In the end, this is more of what you can expect from Cussler. I stayed up until 2 in the morning to finish it.	2002-06-08

Rather than proceed chronologically, Professor Simon organizes his discussion thematically.  He covers employment discrimination, abortion, federal habeas corpus, and the First Amendment (flag burning, church and state separation) in different chapters.  In some ways, this makes a lot of sense, because you get to see the development of controversy over a particular area of law, such as the Reagan administration's repeated efforts to overturn Roe v. Wade.  These efforts included attempting to pack the Court with anti-Roe Justices such as Robert Bork (who was not confirmed), and ultimately culminated in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a case that reaffirmed Roe's central holding (the constitutional right to abortion) but weakened its application.<br />Like most of what is written about the Supreme Court, there is a slight to moderate liberal tilt to &quot;The Center Holds.&quot;  What is written is accurate and probably does not paint an unfair picture of anyone, but you also get a clear sense of what Professor Simon thinks of the Court's rightward swing.<br />In summary, this is a good introduction to the Rehnquist Court, and in some ways, is a good companion piece to &quot;The Brethren.&quot;  Interestingly, both books end on the same tone: the &quot;moderates&quot; are in control of the Court.	2002-04-10
US	52723388	RUBCQQ1UEV50H	068815333X	240949428	Prayers for Rain	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Pretty good but the male-female interaction gets corny	Among the trio of hardboiled male mystery writers who rose in 1990s -- Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, and Dennis Lehane -- you can sort them along a continuum: Connelly is the edgiest and grimmest, while Crais is the one with the most wisecracks.  Lehane falls in between, but leans more toward Crais despite some pretty dark works (&quot;Darkness, Take My Hand&quot; and &quot;Sacred&quot;).<br />&quot;Prayers for Rain&quot; is the most recent of the series (start with &quot;A Drink Before the War&quot;) and as it opens, the narrator (Patrick Kenzie) is operating his P.I. agency alone.  He used to have a partner (Angela Gennaro), but they split over events depicted in &quot;Gone Baby Gone.&quot;<br />Kenzie takes care of a stalking matter for a female client with little problem.  Four months later, she leaves him a message asking him to call, but he blows her off.  Two months after that, she commits suicide.  Feeling guilty, Kenzie delves into the mess to find out why she would kill herself.<br />Doing so draws into a confrontation with a psychopath who gets his kicks from making people's lives so miserable they wish they were dead.  The psychopath turns his attention to Kenzie, and a war of misery ensues.<br />There's no denying that Lehane is a talented writer, and that his books draw you into the dark streets of Boston.  The interaction between Kenzie and Gennaro is fun, but at times the dialogue is downright corny, like something you'd expect from children.  Of course, the reality is that in real life, people who are in love will talk like that to each other, but still, reading it in a book, it seems silly.<br />So, the question is, what are you looking for in a mystery?  Crais' books are fluffier (though still violent), Connelly's much darker and edgier, and Lehane's a compromise.  Pick your poison.	2001-08-05

Although the book occasionally gets into some relatively rigorous economics, it should be accessible to the determined lay reader.<br />Professor Galbraith's central thesis is that the amount of wage inequality (the difference between what the wealthiest make and what the poorest make) is tied directly to a number of key factors: the unemployment rate, the interest rate, the strength of the dollar, and so on.  Essentially, the lower the unemployment rate, the less the degree of wage inequality.  I am simplifying his thesis considerably here, but this is the essence of it.  There is a considerable amount of technical research presented that supports the thesis and demonstrating a strong correlation between wage inequality and unemployment.<br />So, Professor Galbraith makes a persuasive case that the government can affect wage inequality by making certain policy decisions, such as lowering unemployment, raising the minimum wage, weakening the dollar against international currencies, and so on.<br />But, what is missing from the book is a serious justification of why the free market should not dictate the value of labor.  In other words, from a normative standpoint, why should workers be paid two or three or more times the value of their labor?  There are egalitarian arguments to be made, of course, but at the same time, if the value of Bill Gates' labor is, say, 100 times more valuable than the work of a custodian, why should Gates' wages be limited to, say, 30 times that of custodian?  (At one point, Professor Galbraith suggests a 30-1 limitation.)<br />In the end, this is an impressive and valuable work.  You may or may not agree with the policy decisions that Professor Galbraith supports, but his analysis must be reckoned with.	2001-02-23
US	52723388	R2S4SWUF3KY6LD	0316154075	347427189	A Darkness More Than Night	Books	4	106	110	N	N	Dark and edgy, but the mystery isn't too hard to figure out	&quot;A Darkness More Than Night&quot; (the title comes from a line in a novel by Raymond Chandler, who was Connelly's inspiration for becoming a writer) is Michael Connelly's 10th novel.  Six of the first nine star LAPD detective Harry Bosch; one of the other three (&quot;Blood Work&quot;) stars Terry McCaleb, a former FBI agent forced into retirement by heart disease necessitating a transplant.<br />Although Bosch and McCaleb had worked together before, offscreen so to speak, &quot;Darkness&quot; brings them together in the same novel.  McCaleb is happily retired from the serial killer profiling business, making a living from chartering fishing trips around Catalina Island in Southern California, when an LA Sheriff's Dept. deputy friend of his comes to him for his help on a strange murder.  (In case you are wondering, the Sheriff's Department is a county agency; it polices the unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County.  Crimes within L.A. city limits fall within the jurisdiction of the LAPD.)  Against his wife's wishes, McCaleb agrees to take a look.  He comes across a clue that the sheriff's deputies missed the first time, and that clue leads him into a whole new area of investigation that eventually points at . . . Harry Bosch.<br />Some of Connelly's mysteries contain what for me were stunning twists -- &quot;The Concrete Blonde&quot; and &quot;Trunk Music&quot; come to mind.  &quot;Darkness,&quot; on the other hand, proved to be relatively easy to figure out about 100 pages before the end of the novel.  Nevertheless, it's still a gripping read.  Most of Connelly's books are dark and edgy, but the darkness and edginess are even more palpable in this book.  McCaleb's investigation takes him (and the reader) into a very grim Renaissance age painter, the owl as a symbol of evil, and an unnervingly cocky defendant in a media circus trial.<br />One of the most interesting things about &quot;Darkness&quot; for readers who've read the Bosch novels is the glimpse of what Bosch comes across like to someone else.  The encounters between McCaleb and Bosch -- not the first one, but the ones after that -- are fascinating and point to the difference between the two men: especially Bosch's &quot;avenging angel&quot; nature.<br />Another interesting thing about this book (and many of Connelly's others) is the way that he weaves in facts and characters from earlier books.  Readers of &quot;Void Moon&quot; who wonder what happened to Cassie Black's parole officer (Thelma) find out here.  It's just a throwaway paragraph, but it's a nice touch.<br />In summary, Connelly is a consistently good writer, and &quot;Darkness&quot; doesn't disappoint, even if it telegraphs the solution to the mystery a little too early.  It's still satisfying to the end.	2001-01-30
US	52723388	REQRYLCX00BYA	0316154067	559013514	Void Moon	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Pretty good until the end	&quot;Void Moon&quot; is the third non-Harry Bosch book written by Michael Connelly, and the first book in which the main character is not a law enforcement (or ex-law enforcement) investigator.  In fact, no character in the book is in law enforcement, well, except for one minor character who is a parole officer.  Nope, this book is populated by burglars, fences, mobsters, and a murderer/amateur magician.<br />The main character, Cassie Black, served five years on a manslaughter charge when a burglary she was involved in went south.  Her lover and accomplice died during the crime, and she was charged under felony-murder.  At the beginning of the novel, she's been out on parole for 10 months, working at a Porsche dealership.  She needs to leave L.A., though, because (the reader infers quickly) her daughter -- given up for adoption -- is about to be moved to Paris, and she wants to be near her.<br />Going legit hasn't paid off, so Cassie decides to get back in the business for one quick score, enough for her to retire on.  Unfortunately, things never turn out like you expect, and the score leads to all sorts of other problems . . . such as Jack Karch, a sometime PI and sometime wet work man for a mobster who just happens to run the casino where Cassie's previous burglary took place.<br />&quot;Void Moon&quot; displays a lot of the usual trademarks of Connelly's writing: sharp dialogue, fluid narration, vivid characters.  Cassie is generally likeable, even though she's an unredeemed criminal.  Karch is pretty interesting too, even if he is quite ruthless.<br />The only problem with &quot;Void Moon&quot; is the ending, which just doesn't really hang together with the rest of the book.<br />If you like this book, you might take a look at Philip Kerr's &quot;A Five Year Plan.&quot;  Not to mention the other Connelly books.

Recently, I've been re-reading all of them, and I've come to the conclusion that &quot;Fear&quot; is vastly underrated.<br />This is basically a revenge story: the narrator's wife and child are flying in a plane that gets shot down at the beginning of the novel.  Two years later, the narrator has apparently been unhinged enough to have turned to a life of crime, for which he is now being prosecuted.  Only he escapes from the courtroom, taking a young woman hostage.  A reward is put out on his head, and he is captured by a thug who turns him in to the hostage's father.  Instead of turning him over to the police, however, the father hires him for some not entirely legitimate tasks.  The father, it turns out, has been consorting with some shady characters, who may or may not have been responsible for killing the narrator's family.<br />The reviewer below has hit it on the head when he states that the first-person narrated novels by MacLean are the best (and this is one of those).  In case you are wondering, the other first-person narrated MacLean novels are: &quot;Night Without End,&quot; &quot;The Black Shrike,&quot; &quot;The Satan Bug,&quot; &quot;The Golden Rendezvous,&quot; &quot;Ice Station Zebra,&quot; &quot;When Eight Bells Toll,&quot; &quot;Puppet on a Chain,&quot; and &quot;Bear Island.&quot;  Not coincidentally, those are the best MacLean novels; the only others that merit being put in the same category are &quot;The Guns of Navarone,&quot; &quot;Where Eagles Dare,&quot; &quot;The Golden Gate,&quot; and maybe &quot;The Secret Ways.&quot;	2001-01-06

Thomas' novels aren't so much gritty as they are witty, and less about openly violent crimes as about deep corruption beneath the veneer of civilization.<br />\\"The Fools in Town Are On Our Side\\" is one of the best Thomas novels. It's really about three or four stories all wrapped together. The stories all happen to be about the narrator, Lucifer C. Dye. Dye was born in Montana, but spent his childhood in Shanghai, China, before and during World War II. Story No. 1 is about how he came to be raised by a Russian-born madam running Shanghai's top brothel. Story No. 2 is about how Dye came to be the youngest Sergeant Major in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, largely on the strength of his perfectly fluent Mandarin (Chinese), and his subsequent recruitment into a government intelligence program. Story No. 3 is about how he got booted out of the program. And Story No. 4 is the main story, wherein he is offered $50,000 (it was worth a lot more back in 1970 when the book was written) to help \\"corrupt\\" a town, the idea being that in order to get the townspeople to vote for a reform slate, they have to be really fed up with corruption. That requires making things far worse so people see how bad the corruption is.<br />Of course, Thomas does not tell the stories in that sequence. Instead, they're all mixed together, which ordinarily I find annoying, but each story is so interesting that the technique works here.<br />There's a little bit of violence, but for the most part, the book is really about intrigue, double-dealings, and so forth. If you've never read anything by Ross Thomas, this is a great introduction.	2001-01-05

Even sadder, its author, Alistair MacLean, really was quite a talented writer when he was at his peak.<br />The premise of &quot;Goodbye California&quot; is something like Lux Luthor's mastermind plot in the &quot;Superman&quot; movie: using nuclear weapons in fault zones to cause earthquakes.  The heroes are a police detective and his son, a patrol officer; their wife/mother has been kidnapped by the bad guys for an added measure of terror.<br />Unfortunately, the book is largely static, without much action, and curiously without much suspense.<br />As I indicate in the title of this review, &quot;Goodbye California&quot; is the beginning of the end of MacLean's once great talent.  None of the books written after it approaches his terrific earlier works.  &quot;River of Death,&quot; &quot;Partisans,&quot; and &quot;San Andreas&quot; are deadly dull; &quot;Athabasca,&quot; &quot;Floodgate,&quot; and &quot;Santorini&quot; are tolerable.  But none would make you pick up another book by the author.<br />That's too bad because in the 1960s, MacLean hit his stride with a number of terrific works: &quot;Fear is the Key,&quot; &quot;The Black Shrike,&quot; &quot;The Golden Rendezvous,&quot; &quot;The Satan Bug,&quot; &quot;Ice Station Zebra,&quot; &quot;Where Eagles Dare,&quot; and &quot;Puppet on a Chain.&quot;  All of these are first rate thrillers.  The weaker entries in the 1960s, &quot;Force 10 From Navarone&quot; and &quot;When Eight Bells Toll&quot; are still decent -- and much better than &quot;Goodbye California.&quot;	2001-01-04

Simply put, this is the best guidebook there is for Maui.  My wife and I spent a week in Maui a few months ago, and in preparation for the trip, she bought a number of travel books about Maui/Hawaii.  The difference between the other travel books and this one is that the authors of &quot;Maui Revealed&quot; actually present opinions -- positive AND negative -- with explanations of their opinions.  If a place has bad service, the authors say so.  If a place is bad for lunch but good for dinner, they say so.  You may not end up agreeing with all of their opinions, but at least they attempt to help guide you throughout the island.  Not only that, it comes across that the authors had fun writing the book, and there are parts that are pretty funny.<br />The book also tells you a lot about parts of Maui that you wouldn't get from other travel books or from airport leaflets -- for example, on the famous road to Hana, there are a number of waterfalls.  You can see many of them from the road, and people stop to take pictures.  But the book also tells you about a number of hidden waterfalls -- including one underneath a bridge that makes for a fantastic picture of the top of a waterfall.<br />I have to disagree with the reviewer below who felt that this book offered nothing more than what was contained in the airport hand-outs.	2000-12-30

It was made into a very successful movie with Gregory Peck, Anthony Quinn, and David Niven in the starring roles.  The idea of the secret commando team consisting of a number of specialized operatives (Cpt. Mallory -- rock climber extraordinaire; Andrea -- incredibly strong, lethal fighter; Cpl. Miller -- explosives expert; Petty Ofc. Brown -- engineer and radio expert; Lt. Stevens -- rock climber) with a suicidal mission was duplicated in numerous incarnations ranging from &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; to &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; (the TV series).<br />&quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; is a fantastic adventure/war novel.  It's tight and tense throughout, and there's an edge to it that is missing from a number of MacLean's later works.  It comes across as more realistic than the fun to read &quot;Where Eagles Dare.&quot;<br />The basic plot of &quot;Guns&quot; is that the, during World War II, the Germans have recaptured from the Allies a number of Greek islands; the last one left will be taken over soon, dooming over 1000 Allied soldiers.  The British would evacuate the soliders, except they can't get through a channel covered by the Guns of Navarone.  All previous aerial attacks on the guns have failed.  So Mallory and company are sent on a mission to approach the island of Navarone by boat, climb a sheer wall face, infiltrate the German fortress, and blow up the guns.<br />&quot;Force 10&quot; is the sequel to &quot;Guns,&quot; written eleven years later.  It picks up from the ending of the movie, not the novel, so characters who were in the book but not the movie disappear.  This time, there's another mission, and Mallory, Andrea, and Miller are paired with three young soldiers who are more eager and less experienced.  It too has an edginess to it, but it's not as thrilling as &quot;Guns.&quot;<br />Note that the movie version of &quot;Force 10&quot; starring Harrison Ford, Robert Shaw, and Edward Fox is based on the book in name only (well, except for one fight scene, sort of).  Andrea isn't even in the movie.  So don't expect the book to be anything like the movie.  (Which may be good or bad depending on what you thought of the movie.)<br />In sum, these are prime examples of MacLean working at his peak.  You can't go wrong here.	2000-12-21
US	52723388	R3H6QTN24PPWO8	0446602620	435728437	Blood Work	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Pretty good but not Connelly's best	&quot;Blood Work&quot; is the second of Michael Connelly's novels that do not involve his usual protagonist, Harry Bosch.  This time, the main character is Terry McCaleb, a former FBI agent forced to retire because of a heart disease that almost killed him and necessitated a heart transplant.<br />After the L.A. Times prints a &quot;Where are they now?&quot; column about him, McCaleb gets deluged with requests from the public to solve individual tragic mysteries.  He turns all of them down except one: the sister of the person whose heart he received.  A person who was murdered in what appears to be a random crime.  Only as McCaleb investigates more, he finds that the profile of the killer fits . . . himself.<br />Like all of Connelly's works, &quot;Blood Work&quot; has a number of surprising twists that kept me guessing.  In that regard, it's one of his more successful works.  (&quot;The Concrete Blonde&quot; ranks as his best, in my opinion, though I haven't read &quot;Void Moon,&quot; &quot;Trunk Music,&quot; or the new McCaleb-Bosch crossover &quot;A Darkness More than Night&quot; yet.)<br />But what I found ultimately a little disappointing about &quot;Blood Work&quot; was that there didn't seem to be much difference between McCaleb and Bosch.  McCaleb has Bosch's tough, sarcastic sense of humor and even uses some of Bosch's tricks for dealing with bureaucracies.	2000-12-14

Unfortunately, it, like most of the other books he wrote near the end of his career, is not a very good book.<br />The central plot is decent enough: Hamilton, a jungle expert, shows up in Brazil having apparently found a lost Indian city in the jungle.  This attracts the attention of Smith, a man who appeared out of nowhere in the late 1940s with a small fortune that he built up into a large financial empire.  Smith hires Hamilton into taking him to see the lost city, and soon Hamilton, his two trusty companions, and Smith and his entourage are off to the jungle, facing Anaconda snakes, giant spiders, cannibalistic natives, dizzying heights, and so on.  But Hamilton has his own personal agenda . . . .<br />Unlike his earlier works, &quot;River of Death&quot; just isn't well-narrated.  The descriptions are tired, the characters are even more flat than usual, and the story just isn't very compelling.<br />If you are a devoted fan of MacLean (as I am), you will probably make your way through this poor entry eventually, but if you are new to MacLean, look elsewhere first, or else you may not give him a second chance, and that would be a shame.  Instead, start with any of the following: &quot;The Guns of Navarone,&quot; &quot;Where Eagles Dare,&quot; &quot;The Golden Rendezvous,&quot; &quot;The Golden Gate,&quot; or &quot;Ice Station Zebra.&quot;	2000-11-28

The protagonist, Johnny Harlan, is a gifted race car driver who appears to have fallen under the spell of alcohol after a devastating wreck that kills his best friend and fellow driver, along with maiming his girlfriend.  But in actuality, Harlan's alcoholism is a facade to allow him to investigate the circumstances behind the accident.<br />There's plenty of car chases, sneaking around, and other staples of the adventure novel.  Still, the book gets only three stars because it's curiously unthrilling compared to other books by Alistair MacLean.  While this one is okay, you would do better to look for any of the following:<br />&quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; &quot;The Golden Gate&quot; &quot;The Black Shrike&quot; &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;	2000-11-07

MacLean originally wrote this novel (and &quot;The Satan Bug&quot;) under a pseudonym, so he may have been experimenting a bit with his formula.<br />Anyway, like most MacLean books, the plot is the most important element.  The hero is typical MacLean: tough, resourceful, but possessed of emotions such as fear, and gifted with a self-deprecating sense of humor.  A number of top nuclear physicists have disappeared, so Benton is set up with a cover guaranteed to attract attention from the wrong elements.  Sure enough, he and Marie, another agent posing as his wife, are kidnapped and brought to a seemingly deserted isle.  He is forced to work on a secret missile -- the Black Shrike.  Can Benton save the day?<br />The one thing I could never figure out about this novel was, how much physics did Benton know?  Was he a physicist who went to work as a secret agent?  Or was he a secret agent who was given a crash course in physics?<br />Not that you'll be thinking about that question as you're reading; the book is thrilling.<br />Along with &quot;The Guns of Navarone,&quot; &quot;Where Eagles Dare,&quot; &quot;The Golden Rendezvous,&quot; and &quot;The Golden Gate,&quot; this is one of the best MacLean novels.	2000-11-02

Mostly, he is known for his research on the Supreme Court, and he has produced a nice history of the Court.<br />This volume is a bit more lighthearted than the usual sort of fare that law professors put out.  Basically, Schwartz has identified what in his view are the ten best Supreme Court decisions, the ten worst Supreme Court decisions, the ten best Supreme Court Justices, the ten worst Supreme Court Justices, and so on.  For each entry, he has a short description of that case/justice/etc., along with explanations of why it/he made the list.<br />The cases will be familiar to any law student, and many of the cases will be familiar to non-lawyers -- i.e., Brown v. Board of Education, Dred Scott, and so on.<br />At a certain level, however, non-lawyers may find that much of the book is too arcane; Justice Cardozo, for example, is well-known to non-lawyers as having authored the definitive opinion in a bizarre case known as Palsgraf, but to non-lawyers, the reference will be missed.	2000-10-31

When Garrison insists on repaying the debt he feels he owes to the doctor, the doctor refers him to an older relative who happens to need something accomplished for which Garrison has the right skills.<br />The deed?  Bring the relative's granddaughter out of Russia (this is during the height of the Cold War) to the United States.  To accomplish this, Garrison forms a team of his military buddies, all with different but necessary skills, and then he comes up with his plan: kidnap a high-ranking Russian official, and then &quot;swap&quot; the official for the girl.  The game's afoot!<br />While Wager's writing style is not literary, it is good enough to lift his books above the vast collection of dredge that one often finds in the thriller market.  A number of Wager's books (though not this one) have been made into decent movies: &quot;Viper Three&quot; (as &quot;Twilight's Last Gleaming&quot;), &quot;Telefon,&quot; and &quot;58 Minutes&quot; (as &quot;Die Hard 2,&quot; with significant modifications, of course).  At his best, which I think &quot;Swap&quot; represents, Wager is pretty close to Alistair MacLean -- and for a thriller writer, that's pretty good.	2000-10-28

MacDonald; all of the &quot;Fletch&quot; novels (including the two &quot;Son of&quot; books) by Gregory McDonald; every Raymond Chandler piece of fiction; most of Dashiell Hammett; some Ed McBain; many Carl Hiassen books; a few Agatha Christies.<br />Michael Connelly ranks up there with all of those distinguished writers.  He has a fluid, detailed writing style that conveys the scene without bogging down in such intricacies that the reader gets lost.  The dialogue is snappy and hard-boiled but will probably age well (unlike, say, some of Chandler's).<br />&quot;The Concrete Blonde&quot; is the third novel starring LAPD detective Harry Bosch.  (The order goes &quot;The Black Echo,&quot; &quot;The Black Ice,&quot; &quot;The Concrete Blonde,&quot; &quot;The Last Coyote,&quot; &quot;Trunk Music,&quot; and &quot;Angel's Flight.&quot;  The new novel coming out in early 2001 involves Bosch as well, but it's not clear if Bosch is the main character or a secondary character.)  I've read the first three and the last (&quot;AF&quot;), and, while they are all good, &quot;The Concrete Blonde&quot; is the best thus far.<br />Earlier in his career, an incident that is described or alluded to in virtually every novel, Bosch gained some notoriety and fame for taking down a serial killer known as &quot;The Dollmaker.&quot;  He was so called because he would use makeup and polish to paint up his victims.  The killer sent bad poems to Bosch, taunting him with descriptions of the victims.  Eventually, Bosch tracked down the killer and shot him to death when the man reached toward his pillow . . . for a hairpiece, as it turned out.  Bosch was cleared of wrongfulness in the shooting, though he was disciplined for not calling for backup.<br />Fast forward four years.  The dead man's widow is now suing the LAPD and Bosch for violating her husband's civil rights, and the case is going to trial.  All of a sudden, a letter is dropped off for Bosch at the police department: it contains a poem, just like the ones the Dollmaker sent, and it leads the LAPD to another body . . . which is painted up just like the Dollmaker's victims.  Could Bosch have killed the wrong man?<br />&quot;The Concrete Blonde&quot; alternates between the court scenes and the investigation of the new murder, and the transitions are deftly handled.  While the court scenes are not perfectly accurate (I am, unfortunately, a lawyer by trade), they are much better than in most novels.<br />The mystery is tight and compelling.  Having read lots of mysteries, I often am able to guess at the outcome simply because the set-up reminds me of another book I've read.  In fact, that happened with &quot;The Black Ice.&quot;  Not so with &quot;The Concrete Blonde.&quot;  About 180 pages into it, I thought I had it figured out.  With about 50 pages to go, I thought my instinct had been confirmed.  Oops.  I was wrong, and about as shocked as Bosch!<br />In addition to weaving a great mystery, Connelly paints a reasonably deep picture of his main character, Bosch, a Vietnam veteran (he cleared out enemy tunnels) who is simultaneously cultured but also emotionally damaged.<br />To sum it up, let me put it this way: I started with &quot;Angel's Flight,&quot; and when I was finished, I ordered all of the Harry Bosch novels immediately.	2000-10-25

Dick novel I read (having read just about all of them now, it's hard to remember which was first, but I think it was &quot;Martian Time-Slip&quot;), I would recommend it as the best starting point for someone trying to decide if PKD is your cup of tea.  &quot;Ubik&quot; has all of the major elements of the typical PKD novel (to the extent there is any typicality): (1) questioning of the meaning of reality; (2) an almost pathetic sense of humor in the face of the unraveling of reality; (3) an everyman protagonist; and (4) extreme readability despite a somewhat pedestrian writing style.<br />The plot can be summed up like this: some humans have psychic powers, but rather than being seen as heroes (as is the case in most sci-fi), they're possible sources of invasions of your privacy.  Never fear, however, because some humans have developed anti-psychic powers -- they block the powers of the others.  A bunch of anti-psychics go on a mission, but something goes wrong and they barely get away with their lives.  Almost immediately, they notice that something is not right.  Phone directories are out of date, coffee is disgustingly stale, and so on.  Time, it seems, is flowing backwards!<br />For readers who aren't aware, PKD was one of the most influential sci-fi writers, with his reality-warping stories.  His interest in this topic can be traced, no doubt, to his youthful experimentation with narcotics -- an experience recounted largely in &quot;A Scanner Darkly.&quot;<br />PKD was an incredibly prolific writer; he wrote something like 16 novels in a five year stretch in the late-1960s, including &quot;Ubik.&quot;  Many of his best novels were written during that stretch.  If you like &quot;Ubik,&quot; I would suggest in no particular order: &quot;The Gameplayers of Titan,&quot; &quot;The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch,&quot; &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; (made into the movie &quot;Bladerunner&quot;), &quot;Dr. Bloodmoney,&quot; and &quot;The Man in the High Castle.&quot;  By the 1970's, PKD stopped writing as many novels, and they became more thematically complex, with increasing emphasis on religious spirituality.	2000-10-08
US	52723388	R29P26TQS6BDXP	055310666X	284106836	False Memory	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Decent, but Koontz can and has done much better	I am a Dean Koontz fan and have turned a number of friends onto his books.  This is true even though I'm not a fan of horror novels.<br />At his best, Koontz offers terrific writing: crisp, energetic, and stylish.  The first chapter of &quot;Dark Rivers of the Heart&quot; is fantastic in its ability to evoke the pain and desperate hope that the main character feels.<br />However, when he's not at his best, Koontz has passages that are embarassingly juvenile -- there's a running joke about the title of a science-fiction novel in &quot;Mr. Murder&quot; that goes on way too long.  The recent novels &quot;Fear Nothing&quot; and &quot;Seize the Night&quot; -- and especially &quot;False Memory&quot; -- suffer from dialogue that would be hard to believe from teenagers, much less adults.  While not a fatal flaw, this does detract from the otherwise gripping story.<br />The other problem with &quot;False Memory&quot; is to some extent endemic to the thriler/mystery genre, and that is that it's really hard to come up with new ideas.  &quot;Fear Nothing,&quot; for example, recycles heavily from Koontz's own &quot;Midnight&quot;; and &quot;Ticktock&quot; is largely a rehash of &quot;Dragon Tears.&quot;  Plots don't even have to be similar to pick up on this; Greg McDonald's &quot;Fletch&quot; and John MacDonald's &quot;Dress Her in Indigo&quot; are nothing alike in plot, but if you read one, you can figure the other one out in a second.<br />If you've read Koontz's &quot;Strangers&quot; (a terrific book), you'll find yourself ahead of the curve on &quot;False Memory.&quot;  To Koontz's credit, he doesn't hide the identity of the evil mastermind for long, so guessing his identity early doesn't ruin the book.<br />In summary, despite the flaws I've identified, I think &quot;False Memory&quot; is still a good book.  Just not up to par with Koontz's best: &quot;Watchers,&quot; &quot;Strangers,&quot; &quot;Lightning,&quot; and &quot;Dark Rivers of the Heart.&quot;	2000-09-25

Rather, Carter is interested in analyzing what has gone wrong with the  nomination/confirmation process.  His primary case studies include the  rejection of Robert Bork for the Supreme Court and Lani Guinier for Deputy  Attorney General (head of the Civil Rights Division), as well as the  successful confirmations of Justice Thomas and Justice Thurgood Marshall  (who Carter believes should have been confirmed easily, rather than  subjected to ridiculous attacks by Southern senators).<br />In Carter's view,  the central problem with the process is that candidates are presumed to be  qualified, with the search on to root out disqualifying pasts.  Thus, Zoe  Baird, nominated for the Attorney General, was withdrawn when it turned out  that she had a &quot;nanny problem.&quot;  Should she have been  disqualified for that?  According to Carter, maybe, maybe not.  But the  sequence and emphasis of questions is all wrong.<br />The process, he argues,  should work something like this: (1) do not presume that the candidate is  qualified; (2) if a potential disqualifying factor arises, determine how  serious it is -- unqualified is uncurable, minor ethical lapse may be  easily curable, and other matters in between.<br />Moreover, Carter's analysis  is non-partisan.  He aptly demonstrates that Guinier's candidacy went down  in flames because her academic writing was grossly distorted (if even read)  -- as was Bork's.<br />Finally, Carter is a clear and direct writer, and lay  persons as well as those involved in law will find this a fascinating  analysis of the nomination/confirmation process.	2000-09-06

Mad because the judicial system is  painted as so-out-of-control, or mad because you think Boot is a  conservative hack (who writes for the Wall Street Journal's editorial  pages).<br />What Boot has done, and done effectively, is gather horrible  anecdote after horrible anecdote, organize them in general categories like  corrupt judges, incompetent judges, and so on.  The picture that he paints  is pretty grim: if a judge isn't on the take, he or she might be plain  weak, stupid, arrogant, or deluded.<br />But how seriously are we to take  Boot's thesis?  While the individual cases that he discusses are (to  varying degrees) disturbing, the central problem with this book lies in the  fact that the reader is supposed to evaluate a judge based on one case, out  of thousands or more that the judge might see in his or her career.<br />At  the same time, Boot strangely ignores some obvious targets for those who  would like to criticize the judiciary.  For example, Judge Stephen  Reinhardt (a federal appeals judge in California) is usually the  posterchild for judicial activism: he is one of the judges most-often  reversed by the Supreme Court.  Yet, Judge Reinhardt rates only one  mention, and it is actually praise from Boot.  Now, I'm not suggesting  necessarily that Boot would think that Reinhardt is worthy of criticism  (though I think it fairly obvious, given their respective ideologies), but  there is a history and pattern of judicial opinions from which one could  draw definite conclusions.<br />As other reviewers have noted, this is a  critical weakness of &quot;Out of Order.&quot;  It's a collection of  anecdotes, almost a survey of judges across the country, but not very deep  in its scope.	2000-08-31

There's some science of meteorites, a naval skirmish,  something of a love affair, and a lot about engineering.  The gore level is  relatively low, although there are a number of deaths.  Like  &quot;Riptide,&quot; there is a mystery buried within the adventure story,  and the reader is kept guessing to the last page.<br />Among their books, I  would rate &quot;The Ice Limit&quot; on a par with &quot;Riptide,&quot;  just below &quot;Mount Dragon,&quot; and above &quot;Thunderhead&quot; and  &quot;Reliquary.&quot;	2000-07-28

After that, it kicks into high gear and never lets up.<br />Set in 2005, the plot is  kind of a funny version of Neal Stephenson's &quot;Snow Crash&quot;  (without the Sumerian mythology) crossed with Jay McInerney's &quot;Bright  Lights, Big City,&quot; with some doses of William Gibson's  &quot;Neuromancer.&quot;  The narrator works as a tech-nerd at a huge  corporate conglomerate, with a horrible boss, gets fired, and is approached  to cause some havoc at his former employer's information database.<br />Much  of the novel is set in a virtually real Internet -- and for once, an author  writing about virtual reality does NOT resort to the &quot;if you die in  here, you die in reality&quot; trick.<br />Bethke pays homage along the way to  an impressive collection of pop culture: &quot;The Godfather,&quot;  &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail,&quot; &quot;Sesame Street,&quot;  &quot;Brave New World,&quot; and &quot;Doom&quot; and other first person  shooter games among others.

There are 100 hikes covering everywhere from San Diego to central California, with  regional maps to show roughly where the hikes are.<br />Each hike contains  pretty much all of the information that you would want: how long is the  hike (in distance and in time), how do you get there, how difficult is the  hike, how much does it cost to enter (a few of the prices may be a little  outdated), what do you get to see on it, and when is the best time to go on  the hike (i.e., when are flowers most likely to bloom).  Many of the hikes  have black and white pictures, although the written descriptions tend to be  more helpful in assessing the desirability of the hike.<br />Moreover, an  outstanding feature of this book is that for many of the hikes, the author  includes a short section on how to make the hike more (or less in some  cases) challenging.  Thus, hikers of different experience and physical  condition can tailor the hikes to their own desires.<br />My wife and I like  this book so much that we're thinking of getting the author's book on easy  hikes in Northern California, just for future visits.	2000-07-16
US	52723388	R2X1KDM68YY766	0553580167	34846573	Gemini Man	Books	4	7	7	N	N	More of a psychological thriller than an action one	The central plot of &quot;The Gemini Man&quot; can be summed up like this: a U.S. covert operative (i.e., a spy/saboteur) with an IQ of 186 and no apparent moral conscience to speak of has just spent six and a half years  in a horrible Russian prison.  He had been caught after sabotaging a  Russian nuclear power plant, causing it to explode and killing thousands of  people.  Now he is being released to the United States.  But the U.S. wants  to see if he belongs in society, so it puts in (involuntarily) into a  psychiatric ward in Europe, where he is observed by a group of  psychologists.  He, of course, wants out; after all, he escaped twice from  the Russian prison before being recaptured.<br />You might expect that with  this set-up, the novel would be a slam-bang action thriller about his  escape and revenge against those he perceives as having wronged him.  And  yet, that isn't really the direction that Richard Steinberg seemed  interested in writing about.  Instead, much of the novel covers a sort of a  psychological chess match between the operative (Newman) and his  captors/observers.<br />Along the way, the psychologists tasked with figuring  Newman out come up with different theories to explain his seemingly lack of  moral empathy, a condition generally described as sociopathic -- which  doesn't apply to him because he doesn't have sociopathic tendencies.  One  psychologist in particular believes that Newman is the next evolutionary  step -- a human who is able to act and think without the hinderance of  morality, excessive emotionalism, and so on.  A sort of Mr. Spock.  Or, as  you can see from the name, a &quot;New man.&quot;<br />Curiously, Newman is  not a particularly interesting character, although the psychologists are.   One reason for this is that Steinberg writes in a third person omniscient  narration, so that the reader is privy to the thoughts of the characters,  but he hides much more of Newman's thoughts from us than those of other  characters.  Thus, we get less of a sense of what Newman is thinking, and  hence understand him less.<br />The psychological aspect of this novel  reminded me somewhat of Philip Kerr's excellent &quot;A Philosophical  Investigation,&quot; while the evolutionary debate was reminiscent of Frank  Robinson's &quot;Waiting.&quot;	2000-07-16

Each chapter looks at the  subject as depicted in the various movies, and then speculates on how  likely the subject is scientifically.  She has an open-mind; even when the  subject seems to be scientifically inaccurate, she writes diplomatically  that it seems unexplained, or needs some explanation beyond our  understanding.<br />For the most part, she is a good writer.  However, the  book is sprinkled with repeated lame jokes about wishing bad things unto  Imperial stormtroopers.  It's kind of funny the first time, but after that,  it becomes silly.<br />Also, the section discussing the Force delves into a  heavy dose of quantum mechanics.  There are no equations or diagrams, but  it is an extended discussion, albeit at a layperson's level.<br />Finally, the  paperback version contains an update based on &quot;The Phantom  Menace.&quot;	2000-07-09

Books	4	4	6	N	Y	Kind of a precursor to &quot;The Matrix&quot; minus special effects	Can you live forever by electronically replicating your brain in the form of a computer program?  &quot;Uploading,&quot; as the concept is sometimes referred to, has been around in science fiction for a long time: variations  of it were kicked around in episodes of the old Star Trek (&quot;What Are  Little Girls Made Of?&quot;, &quot;I, Mudd&quot; and &quot;Return to  Tomorrow&quot;, among others), The X-Files (&quot;Kill Switch&quot;), and  so on.<br />In &quot;The Silicon Man,&quot; Charles Platt aims at providing a  technically plausible approach to uploading.  The plot, such as it is,  involves an FBI agent who, while investigating illegal trafficking in a  special kind of gun, stumbles upon a group of scientists working on a  publicly-funded project thought to have been a money sink, but which has  actually succeeded beyond the wildest dreams.  The scientists have to get  rid of the FBI agent, but they can't quite bring themselves to kill him, so  they copy his mind and put him in their electronic universe -- which is  kind of like the Matrix (from the movie), though without any of the bells  and whistles.  Instead of Agents (the computer programs in &quot;The  Matrix&quot;) to torment our hero, however, there's the main computer  scientists, who is a megalomaniac with the power to alter the computer  environment as he sees fit.  Yikes! <br />Platt pushes the science and  technology reasonably far, but the concept still seems a little  unbelievable.  Happily, that doesn't detract from the novel, which I  finished in basically one sitting.	2000-07-02

As you read the books, you get  the sense that he is so attuned to the people who populate his world that  he could write novels centered on any of them.<br />Now, you are probably  aware that the book is somewhat about abortion.  Indeed, Irving clearly has  a point to make about the pro-choice vs. pro-life debate, and it's pretty  clear which side he's on.  But at the same time, to say that the book is  &quot;about&quot; abortion is like saying that &quot;Casablanca&quot; is  about World War 2.  Clearly, abortion is inextricably intertwined with the  plot and the characters, but the novel is not about abortion; rather, it's  about characters who have to make life decisions, including about  abortion.<br />One final note: for better or worse, I tend not to have much  patience for &quot;literature.&quot;  I've read some Dickens, but would  never do so for fun.  My idea of great literature is  &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; by Neal Stephenson.  But . . . I absolutely loved  reading &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; and I was never bored.	2000-06-28

The great thing about Paul Hoffman's &quot;Archimedes' Revenge&quot; is that he shows you the beauty and  perfection without your having to be a math major to  understand.<br />Moreover, for anyone who's wondered what use math is, Hoffman  can answer that as well.  Among the subjects covered are: cryptology (code  making and code breaking), architecture, computer science, and political  science.<br />The book is divided into a number of sections, ranging from  number theory to topology to game theory.  While these may sound like  esoteric (and useless) concepts, Hoffman masterfully weaves in stories,  such as the (in)famous Beale cipher, a secretly coded treasure map that has  resisted all attempts to crack it for over 100 years.<br />I recommended to a  colleague of mine that she buy this book for her teenage son, who is bright  but a slacker.  She reported that he raved about the book and was so eager  to discuss it with her!<br />As an example of the sort of thing covered in  this book, Hoffman describes a game where A, B, and C all have balloons and  darts.  A hits his target 80% of the time; B hits his target 60% of the  time; and C hits his target 40% of the time.  If each person attacks his  strongest opponent, who wins most often?  Surprisingly, the answer is C,  because A and B concentrate their attacks on each other.<br />In summary, if  you have math-phobia but would like to conquer it, this is a great place to  start.  There are no equations to speak of, just concepts explained in  (relatively) plain English.  It may take a couple of readings to understand  it all, but it's definitely within grasp for those who progressed no  farther than Algebra 2 in high school.	2000-06-20

Would the public think that this plan was criminal,  or brilliant?<br />Kyle Mills presents both sides of the debate well in this  fast-paced novel; the FBI agents assigned to catch the poisoner fell  ambivalence about the &quot;victims.&quot;<br />But where the novel really  shines is following John Hobart, the ex-DEA agent who implements the plan.   Nominally the &quot;bad guy,&quot; Hobart is quite cunning, and up until  near the end, you can actually understand his thinking.  (Namely, that the  way to stop the drug trade is to reduce demand, not to restrict supply.)   Many antagonists in novels are evil but stupid; Hobart is neither, at least  through most of the novel.<br />This novel is never boring, and it displays a  sharp, cynical view of politics without ever getting too cute.	2000-06-13

Branson and his men block off both ends of the bridge, wire it with  explosives, and demand millions of dollars . . . plus a pardon.  Any rescue  attempts will result in the detonation of the explosives, killing the  President and destroying the Golden Gate Bridge.<br />But Branson is an  ego-maniac, and he can't resist attention from the media.  So he not only  lets, but actually invites, the press to stay on the bridge and cover the  story.  Too bad for Branson that one of the journalists is actually FBI  Special Agent Paul Revson.<br />The game is underway: Can Revson disable the  explosives and stop the plot?  Will Branson discover that Revson is really  an agent?<br />There's no characterization to speak of, and as a writer,  MacLean is passable but nothing special.  Still, read solely for its plot,  &quot;The Golden Gate&quot; is fun and diverting.	2000-06-08

(The only other that comes to mind right now is &quot;The Federalist  Papers.&quot;)<br />&quot;Simple Justice&quot; is really two books in one: the  first deals with the horrific institution of slavery in the United States  and the post-Civil War oppression of blacks in the form of Jim Crow laws;  the second deals with the strategy that desegregationists (principally the  NAACP) used to dismantle the formal apartheid of the South.<br />Evaluated  solely on its subject matter, this book would merit the requirement of  being read.  The story of how Thurgood Marshall (then a top NAACP attorney,  later U.S. Solicitor General, then U.S. Supreme Court Justice) chipped away  at the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine in small steps gives the  reader an appreciation of how entrenched institutional racism was as  recently as the mid-20th Century.  In addition, the reader will gain an  understanding of how what is arguably the most important decision of the  Supreme Court of the 1900s came about.<br />But there's another reason to read  &quot;Simple Justice.&quot;  Richard Kluger is an amazingly gifted writer  (for proof, try reading the first chapter of &quot;Ashes to Ashes,&quot;  his monumental work on the tobacco industry; even if you don't smoke, his  description of smoking in the first chapter will have you feeling the smoke  go down your throat), and his powerful prose makes you feel the pain that  his characters endured as a result of slavery and Jim Crow laws.<br />By no  means is this is a &quot;fun&quot; book to read; indeed, parts of it are  incredibly unpleasant to read and will make you ashamed to be an American  (unless, of course, you're John Rocker).  But it's precisely because Kluger  is able to evoke such shame that makes this book so important.	2000-06-07

That is, until he learns that President-elect Kennedy slept  with his wife.  All of a sudden, Jefferson is off to kill Kennedy, and the  Mob is in the strange position of having to work to protect Kennedy, whom  they helped to elect by rigging the election in exchange for calling off  the government dogs.<br />The fact that we know that Kennedy wasn't  assassinated in 1960 actually doesn't affect one's enjoyment of the book,  because Kerr does a good job of moving the plot along, and because his (for  the most part) meticulous research about events in 1960 creates a feeling  of verisimilitude.  [Someone should tell Kerr that it's the Second  Amendment, not the First Amendment, that allegedly guarantees the right to  bear arms.]<br />One gets the feeling that Kerr's spark for writing his novels  is something along the lines of &quot;What if . . .&quot;  So, we have: (1)  What if we could identify a physical characteristic linked to serial  killers (&quot;A Philosophical Investigation&quot;); (2) What if there was  a building run by a psychopathic supercomputer (&quot;The Grid&quot;); (3)  What if there was a supercontagious blood-borne virus for which there was a  cure, but the rich purposefully rationed the cure (&quot;The Second  Angel&quot;); (4) What if I [Philip Kerr] tried to write a novel likeElmore Leonard (&quot;A Five-Year Plan&quot;); and (5) What if I [Kerr]  tried to write a novel like Michael Crichton (&quot;Esau&quot;)?<br />Along  those lines, &quot;The Shot&quot; seems to have been inspired by two  separate lines of thought: What if I [Kerr] tried to write a novel about an  anti-hero like Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley; and what if I [Kerr] tried  to write a Kennedy conspiracy novel?<br />&quot;The Shot&quot; was compelling  enough that I read the last 150 pages in a single sitting.  But if you  haven't read Kerr before, I would suggest starting with &quot;A  Philosophical Investigation&quot; or &quot;The Grid,&quot; depending on  your sensibilities.	2000-06-06

That work showed a terrific sense of style and mood, and marked Ferrigno as a great writer to watch.   Unfortunately, his next few works fell short of the promise he displayed in  &quot;THL.&quot;  It wasn't that his books were dull; they just were  missing the ingredients that made &quot;THL&quot; so readable: noirish  atmosphere, sharp characterization and dialogue, and brief but explosive  bits of violence and action.<br />In &quot;Heartbreaker,&quot; Ferrigno  rediscovers his touch.  In plot, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; is basically a  revenge and chase novel: the main character is an undercover cop (sort of),  whose partner gets murdered and his cover gets blown.  So he runs from the  bad guy, and along the way, falls in with a beautiful biologist with a  quirky family.  Brother is a loser sociopath who is hooked up with an even  more sociopathic knockout redhead with murderous thoughts.  The main  character gets drawn into the looney family, at the same time, taunting yet  trying to evade the bad guy who killed his partner.<br />But it isn't the plot  that makes this so readable.  Ferrigno captures a certain almost romantic  sense of adventure, akin to Raymond Chandler's novels, but with a modern  feel.<br />The ending is a little maudlin, but generally works.	2000-06-01

But like many of his works, the main character is an  emotionally tortured male who encounters something unusual -- in this case,  although his wife and two daughters died in a plane crash, a woman on that  same flight seems to have survived, and with one of his daughters to boot.   Thus begins a chase within a chase, where Joe Carpenter desperately seeks  the woman and child, thereby leading to being chased by those who do not  want him to succeed.<br />Along with the way, Koontz's fertile imagination  spins a horrifying (though not in a repulsively gross way) scenario of  Science Gone Wrong, involving genetic experimentation.<br />&quot;Sole  Survivor&quot; gets by on a pretty compelling plot, but it doesn't have the  depth of characterization and emotional resonance of his best works  (&quot;Dark Rivers of the Heart,&quot; &quot;Watchers,&quot; or  &quot;Lightning&quot;).	2000-05-24

Starting around the time of &quot;Get Shorty,&quot; he seemed to lose some  of the grit, replacing it with sharp humor, while retaining the street  smart view.  It was as if he were writing with a slight tinge of Carl  Hiaasen.<br />&quot;Freaky Deaky&quot; straddles those two eras.  It's got the  humor but also the grittiness.  The plot revolves around four characters,  two &quot;good guys&quot; and two &quot;bad guys.&quot;  (Actually, a bad  guy and a bad woman.)  The two good guys are police detectives formerly on  the bomb squad, and the others are 60s radicals who never grew up.  As in  any Leonard novel, the two pairs are in a collision course toward each  other, with a slam-bang climax.  The dialogue crackles (Leonard has a  terrific ear for dialogue), and the characters are sharply drawn.	2000-05-22

Looking back on it now, it seems unfair to put David Foster Wallace in the same category as  those writers, as he is far more talented and imaginative.<br />&quot;The  Broom of the System&quot; is Wallace's debut, and like most first-borns, it  received the most love and attention.  It's more accessible than  &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; and can be read more easily in smaller chunks  without having to figure out, for example, when the events being narrated  actually took place.<br />There isn't much of a plot in &quot;Broom,&quot;  which is remarkable when one considers that the novel runs over 500 pages.   Loosely speaking, it's about the travails of Lenore Stonecipher Beadsman, a  24 year old woman who works as a telephone switch operator for a magazine  edited by her lover, Rick Vigorous, who is anything but.  Her grandmother  (also named Lenore) has disappeared from her nursing home, and Lenore is  the only one who seems worried.  But that's only a fraction of what the  book is about.<br />It's full of stories within stories, some the sad  submissions that Vigorous derides (but that are far better than his limp  and self-indulgent attempts at writing), others little asides that seem  irrelevant but aren't.  Mostly, &quot;Broom&quot; is an exploration of  language and ideas -- some chapters involve highly detailed descriptions  of, for example, the Goldberg-like trail of a pebble; other chapters are  entirely dialogue, with no description of who is speaking (but which is  clear from context).<br />In other words, this is not a novel about sex and  drugs (although there are sex and drugs), and it's not a shallow, Gen-Ex  picture of excess.  The nearest comparison I can think of, in a loose way,  is Neal Stephenson's &quot;Cryptonomicon.&quot;	2000-05-22

Quite ironic, considering that I almost didn't read it because the Julia Ormond-movie almost turned me away from it completely.<br />The  narrator, Smilla, is, to be blunt, obnoxious, arrogant, mean-spirited, and  emotionally damaged.  But she also makes for an intriguing guide through  the novel.  She's very interesting, the way Holden Caulfield is  interesting.<br />The plot of the novel begins with Smilla's attempts to  unravel the mysterious death of a young boy who lived in the same apartment  building.  The boy supposedly fell off the roof to his death, but by  examining the snow tracks -- Smilla's sense of snow -- she determines that  he didn't fall.<br />Long before Neal Stephenson's &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;  came around, &quot;Smilla's Sense of Snow&quot; presented a  scientifically-nerdy view of the thriller, packed with all kinds of trivia  and even a math equation relating to the density of snow.<br />I recommended  this book to three of my co-workers, all of whom raved about it as much as  I did.  Unfortunately, I didn't find &quot;Borderliners&quot; to be  anywhere near the same level.  Hoeg may be a one-hit wonder, but that hit  is a bull's eye.	2000-05-19
US	52723388	R2HJA5E8YFRPZZ	0452277051	203341062	The People's Choice: A Novel	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Some people write academic articles, he wrote a novel	The U.S. Constitution is full of quirks and oddities.  (To see what law professors have to say, take a look at &quot;Constitutional Stupidities, Constitutional Tragedies,&quot; a collection of essays about what they  think are the dumbest provisions of the Constitution.)<br />One of those is  the Electoral College.  You probably remember from high school  government/civics classes about this bizarre process where your votes in  November every four years for President don't really get counted directly,  but instead determine how many &quot;electoral votes&quot; the candidate  gets.  That's why candidates consider the big states, California, Texas,  etc. so important -- you need 270 electoral votes to win the presidency,  and California delivers over 50 by itself in a winner-take-all vote.  So  whoever gets the most votes in California, even by one vote, gets ALL of  California's electoral votes.<br />Anyway, Jeff Greenfield obviously thinks  the Electoral College is ridiculous and stupid, and he sat around and  thought up of a scenario to prove it.  Others would have written a law  review article or an editorial in the Wall Street Journal; Greenfield came  up with a novel.<br />The plot, such as it is, is really a gimmick to  highlight the constitutional crisis that the Electoral College could give  rise to.  What if a conservative presidential candidate picks a moderate  but stupid vice-presidential candidate (think Dan Quayle with Rockefeller  politics), and wins in the election, but before the Electoral College meets  to vote, the president-elect dies?  If the electoral voters find the  vice-president-elect anathema, can they vote for someone else?  Who should  become president if the candidate who lost would thrash the  vice-president-elect in a direct vote against each other?<br />As a polemic  against the Electoral College, this is a very successful work, much more  readable than an academic article would be.  As a novel, it's okay.  It's  not laugh out loud funny the way some of the published reviews suggest, and  the characters are largely there to advance political arguments.<br />But as a  whole, this is a worthwhile read for those interested in politics.	2000-05-13

Those qualities make  &quot;Shadow&quot; fascinating reading, particularly with respect to  Woodward's take on the various scandals that have swirled around the  Clinton Presidency (i.e., Whitewater, Filegate, Travelgate, and Monica  Lewinsky).  This is a compulsively readable work.<br />At the same time, there  is an air of suspicion about Woodward's sourcing.  Who did he talk to to  get the quotes he got?  For example, on page 360, he recounts a  conversation among President Clinton, Bruce Lindsey, and Bob Bennett about  an evidentiary ruling by Judge Wright in the Paula Jones matter.  Bennett  supposedly says, &quot;The key thing is, don't go in and perjure  yourself.&quot;<br />Who is Woodward's source for this reporting?  The  endnotes state &quot;Author's interviews with knowledgeable sources.&quot;   Other than Clinton, Bennett, and Lindsey, who could be knowledgeable about  the conversation?  It is highly unlikely that Clinton was the source, and  Lindsey and Bennett are both attorneys; for them to disclose the contents  of the conversation would breach the attorney-client privilege and would  constitute a great ethical lapse.<br />Yet, the conversation has an authentic  feel to it.  It sounds right.  But Woodward's questionable sourcing, which  dates back to &quot;The Final Days,&quot; rears its ugly head here.   Throughout entire passages that sound like they really happened, the reader  is left wondering, How does Woodward know this?<br />In summary, I wouldn't  pay full price for this book, but it is worth a few dollars if you can find  it in a remaindered pile or a bargain section.	2000-05-07

He does it all on the strength of plot; style and characterization are nearly non-existent, but they aren't the reason you read MacLean books.  I dare  say that virtually every major adventure plot is covered in one of his  novels, and his influence is such that subsequent authors have paid homage  to scenes of his.  (For example, there's a scene in Clive Cussler's  &quot;The Mediterranean Caper&quot; that's a virtual reprise of a scene  from &quot;The Secret Ways.&quot;)<br />&quot;The Golden Rendezvous&quot; is a  classic ocean hijacking story, where the hero is the ship's First Officer  (John Carter).  The ship is a converted ocean liner, full of guests, some  mysterious, and carrying some secret cargo.  During the cruise, the ship  gets hijacked by some violent but devious criminals.  Some of the ship's  officers are killed, and others, including Carter, are wounded.  Still,  Carter attempts to stop the hijackers. . . .<br />This is one of the best  MacLean novels, written in the 1960s along with a stellar run that includes  &quot;The Satan Bug,&quot; &quot;Where Eagles Dare,&quot; &quot;Puppet on a  Chain,&quot; and &quot;The Guns of Navarone.&quot;  Most of those were  turned into movies, and in the 1970s, Hollywood adapted &quot;The Golden  Rendezvous&quot; into a so-so Richard Harris movie titled &quot;Nuclear  Terror.&quot;	2000-05-07

At his best -- his non-fiction work, &quot;The Hacker Crackdown&quot; -- he is a fabulous, witty, fascinating writer.  But his  fiction, particularly his novels (I refer here to &quot;Islands in the  Net,&quot; &quot;Holy Fire&quot; and &quot;Distraction,&quot; plus  &quot;Heavy Weather,&quot; which I started but never finished), tends to  fall short of his aim.<br />His short stories tend to fare better.  They are  less ambitious but also tighter, and hence less distracting.  &quot;A Good  Old-Fashioned Future&quot; represents his latest collection of stories; the  earlier works are &quot;Globalhead&quot; and &quot;Crystal Express,&quot;  which contains one absolute knock-out story called  &quot;Swarm.&quot;<br />These stories are less experimental than  &quot;Globalhead&quot; and more successful.  Most of them are set in the  near future and focus on collapsing societies.  The last three are set in  the same world and form a loose novella; Sterling seems to like this  setting.<br />None of the stories in here drags unacceptably, and some are  quite good.  It may be that Sterling has settled down to writing clean  readable stories, rather than trying to write &quot;outside the box.&quot;	2000-05-02

For example, under  the Exclusionary Rule, courts must suppress evidence that is obtained  unlawfully, even if the suppression results in letting criminals free.   (Studies show that in reality, the percentage of cases in which criminals  escape prosecution on technicalities is quite low.)  Notwithstanding the  cries of the ACLU and other defenders of criminal rights (such as Alan  Dershowitz), most people probably think this system is crazy.<br />Professor  Amar explains why a common sense approach is in fact the best way to  interpret these constitutional rights.  His analysis involves both a plain  reading of the language of the Amendments (a textual approach) as well as  the historical understanding of these rights (a Framers' intent approach).   Both ways of looking at the issue confirm his belief that the Supreme Court  has made a number of wrong turns throughout the years.<br />Lay persons will  not find this book too difficult or theoretical.	2000-04-26

The novel is set in a  small town in Northern California, where an experiment has been  transforming humans into &quot;something else.&quot;  An FBI agent and a  ragtag group of survivors bands together to respond to the horror.<br />As  with most of Koontz's books, there is a palpable sense of eerieness that  pervades the novel.  Although the book is not without its violent and  occasionally gory moments, it is not stomach-churning; Koontz generates  suspense and terror more through implication than explicit  description.<br />Interestingly, Koontz recycled the central plotline here in  the recent &quot;Fear Nothing.&quot;  (The setting changed from Moonlight  Bay to Moonlight Cove.)  The character in &quot;Fear Nothing&quot; is quite  different, however, so you can't entirely predict the outcome from  &quot;Midnight.&quot;  Still, if you like &quot;Midnight,&quot; you should  like &quot;Fear Nothing,&quot; and vice versa.

B poisons the water in A's canteen.  C, not knowing what B has  done, drills a tiny hole in the canteen.  A goes off to the desert and dies  of thirst.  Who killed A?  After all, if C had not drilled the hole, A  would have been poisoned to death.<br />Katz explores these and other issues  with a very readable and witty style.  One of the famous cases he discusses  is Regina v. Dudley and Stephens, a famous (or infamous) case to all law  students.  Dudley, Stephens, and two others set off in a boat.  Disaster  struck, and they barely managed to get to a lifeboat; however, they had  little food and no water.  Days passed, and as they wondered if they could  survive long enough to be rescued, Dudley suggested to Stephens that they  kill the cabin boy, who was the weakest of the four, and eat him.  The  third person (Brooks) protested, but did take part in the eating when  Dudley and Stephens did the killing.  A couple of days later, they were  rescued.  Dudley and Stephens were prosecuted for murder and convicted.   Should they have been?  Did the desperation of their circumstances make it  &quot;necessary&quot; for them to kill the cabin boy to survive?<br />These  are very difficult questions and are largely unanswered, even in modern  law, but Katz makes them worth thinking about, and he's very entertaining.   Lawyers and non-lawyers should enjoy this book.	2000-04-19

Federal courts exist to adjudicate federal rights (with a  significant exception for so-called &quot;diversity of citizenship&quot;  cases -- those between citizens of different states), and the perception  among liberals is that federal courts are more receptive to federal rights.   One reason for that has been described as the &quot;parity&quot; debate:  are state court judges as competent as federal judges in interpreting the  U.S. Constitution?  Professor Yackle believes the answer is clearly  &quot;no,&quot; and therefore, he would like to see the reach of federal  courts expanded as much as possible to protect those rights.<br />You may not  agree with his ideology, but this is a very important work, for those who  favor a more conservative (and therefore restrictive) role for federal  courts must grapple with and respond to the arguments presented herein.	2000-04-10

In 1995, the law review published responses from leading  constitutional scholars about what they thought was the stupidest provision  in the Constitution.  Most of those responses are reprinted here, either in  the original form, or edited if the author chose to do so.  In addition,  other scholars write here on what they thought were the greatest  &quot;tragedies&quot; of the Constitution (with, one should note, numerous  introductory dissertations on what constitutes a tragedy).<br />Among the  stupidities: (1) if Al Gore (as the vice-president) were impeached, say for  fundraising scandals, he would be entitled to preside over his own Senate  trial!; (2) California, which has about 65 times the population of Wyoming,  has the same number of Senators -- a result that cannot be amended; and (3)  because it is the Electoral College -- and not the voters -- who actually  elect the president, it is theoretically possible that a person will be  elected president who receives fewer popular votes than his/her  opponent.<br />I personally found Georgetown law professor Mark Tushnet's  response to the be the most amusing: &quot;The Whole Thing.&quot;<br />This is  an easily accessible book, and despite the seemingly frivolous nature of  the topic, it actually provides very serious commentary on the U.S.  Constitution.	2000-04-09

While the nature of the  legal disputes in employment cases is not on an intellectual par with, say  constitutional disputes, it is nevertheless complex and at times  fascinating.  The nation's continuing grapples with affirmative action, for  example, demonstrate that there are serious issues that underlie what may  seem to be the simple situation of a fired employee.<br />This book is a  compilation of excerpts from law review articles or books authored by  prominent scholars in the area.  The main focus is on race-based and  sex-based discrimination, and a variety of viewpoints (i.e.,  &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;conservative&quot;) is presented.<br />Note that  this book will NOT teach you how to present (or defend) your own employment  discrimination lawsuit.  It is not intended to be a practical guide to  litigation.  Rather, it is an introduction to the theoretical aspects of  employment law.  If that is what you are interested in, this is a good  place to start.	2000-04-09

Simpson's double homicide trial acquainted everyonewith the concepts of RFLP and PCR testing for DNA, the issue ofscience in courtroom has been on the frontburner.  As Foster and Huber demonstrate, however, this issue has had a long and controversial history.<br />Using the mass tort litigation involving the drug Bendectin, which was used to treat morning sickness but became suspected of causing birth defects, the authors make a key point: the scientific method is not entirely compatible with the legal method.<br />The scientific process consists of formulating a hypothesis, testing the hypothesis to see if it can be disproven, and repeating the testing process until one becomes convinced that the hypothesis must be true.  (Or realizing that it is false, if a test disproves it.)<br />This means, however, that a scientific witness can be neutralized somewhat through clever (but artful) questioning of the sort, &quot;Isn't it possible that . . . .&quot;<br />There are no equations in this book, but there is some discussion of statistics, particularly as used in epidemiology.  The mathematical concepts are not at all difficult, and well worth thinking about.	2000-04-03

In the case of Bendectin, there was no conclusive  medical evidence proving that the drug caused birth defects.  Rather, there  was a statistical association between the use of the drug and birth  defects.  Does this prove that Bendectin causes birth defects?  <br />It might  or it might not.  The field of epidemiology attempts to answer the question  by eliminating other possible explanations for the association.  Various  techniques of epidemiology include blind (or double-blind) testing, data  analysis, and so on.<br />Foster and Huber demonstrate that the scientific  techniques are not entirely conducive with the standards of modern  litigation.  For example, scientists generally do not speak of  &quot;proving&quot; an assertion; rather, they &quot;falsify&quot; it.   That is, they attempt to disprove it -- it is usually easier to show that  something is not true, since you only need to find one example.  When an  assertion has withstood repeated attempts to falsify it, it becomes  generally accepted.<br />This has important ramifications for litigation,  however.  Litigation -- particularly mass torts -- requires a  &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer: in the scientific opinion of the  expert witness, does Bendectin cause birth defects?  The expert will of  course have explained his or her analysis, but in the end, that analysis  must be boiled down into a yes or no answer, regardless of the suitability  of such an intellectual liposuction.<br />In summary, this is a fascinating  book if you are interested in these sorts of issues.  Although the book  covers science and scientific inquiry, it does not require a significant  amount of scientific knowledge.	2000-03-27

One problem that I had, but that you may or may not, is that computer  architecture just is not very interesting.  Thus, learning that parts of  the Enterprise's computer system are useless is just not the same as  learning, for example, that it would take more energy than exists in the  universe to warp space enough to make the Enterprise transverse the  distances described in the shows.	2000-03-16

Although there are some nerdy characters -- a  Stephenson staple -- there is much less emphasis on science than in his own  works, or even &quot;Interface.&quot;  That is, unless you count political  science.<br />In that regard, &quot;The Cobweb&quot; seems more like the  fiction of Ross Thomas and his political thrillers than Neal Stephenson's  works.<br />On its own, &quot;The Cobweb&quot; is a fine read.  It is  essentially a revisionist tale of the Gulf War.  While the book begins in  early 1990 before the war, and ends in February 1991, before the end of the  war, the war takes on tremendous significance.  What if Iraqi terrorists  were creating biological weapons at U.S. universities?

He has a sense of humor that can only be roughly categorized as irreverant, dark, wicked, witty, and &quot;outside the box.&quot;<br />He may be an acquired taste, but I doubt it.   I think either you click with him or you don't.  Because that's the case,  the best thing to do is to read a bit from one of his books before you  decide to buy it.  <br />With that out of the way,  &quot;Practical Demonkeeping&quot; is probably the best of his books.  It's  much tighter in plot than its very loose sequel, &quot;Lust Lizard.&quot;   But there's not a big difference between his best and his worst; while  they're all in different settings (demons, vampires, American Indian gods,  Pacific islanders, or monsters), they are all basically vehicles for his  bizarre humor.	2000-02-05

While I can tolerate blood and gore quite well, religious horror seems to strike a primal fear in me.  Ten  seconds of the head turning scene from &quot;The Exorcist&quot; was too  much for me to stomach.  Although I love Ah-nold movies, I passed on  &quot;End of Days.&quot;<br />So you can understand why I approached  &quot;Millennium Rising&quot; with some trepidation.  I bought it because  it had been described as &quot;The X-Files&quot; crossed with  &quot;Millennium.&quot;<br />I'm happy to report that Jane Jensen did a  fabulous job of bringing me to brink of that primal fear without crossing  the line.  That's not to say that the book is not terrifying at times,  because it is, and there are sequences that really do evoke the feeling of  the end of the world.<br />As other reviewers have noted, there is a key  revelation (so to speak) about halfway through the novel, but that hardly  means you understand everything.  Rather, the puzzlement shifts to a  different level.<br />The only negative I have to say is that the ending  seemed a little forced.  Not unbelievable; it works within the framework of  the book.  But it felt truncated.  Another short chapter would have been  good.  (I think this is because when you have been writing about the  Apocalypse, you need more than a few pages to end your story.)	2000-01-12

The central question for anyone contemplating purchasing this novel is: is it Neal Stephenson, or is it the co-author who's the intellectual engine?<br />It reads like Stephenson -- curiously, more like  &quot;Zodiac&quot; and &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; than like the middle  works, &quot;Snow Crash&quot; and &quot;The Diamond Age.&quot;  &quot;Snow  Crash&quot; is a dazzling portrait of the William Gibson's cyberspace taken  to a higher level: the Metaverse.  It's fascinating, but true science  FICTION.  The same is true of &quot;The Diamond Age,&quot; which, while  Stephenson's most intellectually thought-provoking work, is the least  accessible.<br />&quot;Zodiac&quot; and &quot;Cryptonomicon,&quot; and  &quot;Interface,&quot; on the other hand, are SCIENCE fiction.   &quot;Zodiac&quot; is chock full of information about environmentalism and  industrial pollution; &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; is a cornucopia of  mathematics and cryptology.  The science in those novels is basically  present day, without the need for more than minimal extrapolation.  The  same is true of &quot;Interface.&quot;<br />Other Stephenson touches: a fine  eye toward non-tedious detail.  One thing I found amazing about  &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; was that Stephenson could describe eating cereal  in four pages without making it boring, something that neither Herman  Melville nor Charles Dickens would have been able to accomplish (for me).   &quot;Interface&quot; has that same quality of nerdy fascination in the  seemingly trivial.<br />In summary: if you liked &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;  and/or &quot;Zodiac,&quot; you'll probably like &quot;Interface&quot; as  well.	1999-12-31
US	52723388	R3SB5459BJBGAJ	0688157572	852311879	A Fold in the Tent of the Sky: A Novel	Books	4	6	6	N	N	An excellent, contemplate time travel/psychic thriller	It's odd that this little gem hasn't received more attention, or that I'm the first one to review it, considering that it's more than a year old.<br />As the published reviews indicate, this is a novel about a group of  psychics who work for an organization that uses their talents to assist law  enforcement groups or search and rescue missions.  One of the psychics is  able to go back in time and affect events: for example, he convinces one of  Charles Manson's cult members to leave the cult, which changes the past  because that cult member originally killed actress Sharon Tate.  Tate now  (from our standpoint) ends up in a number of B-movies.  Only the psychic  remembers the world in which Tate dies.  The psychic, who is a bit of a  psychotic and paranoid to boot, starts eliminating his fellow psychics by  preventing their conceptions.  The race is then to stop him before he can  wipe them all out.<br />This is a literary thriller.  Hale is not particularly  interested in developing the commercial side of the psychics' talents;  thus, very little of the novel is devoted to the missions.  Rather, he  focuses on two aspects of the psychic talent: (1) what would it be like to  have such a power?; and (2) what happens if you change the past?<br />The  psychics are not a group of people who are enamored with their talent.  For  some, it's a curse that they can pick up so much of other people's miseries  through a casual touch.  None of them, prior to being recruited by the  organization, has found the talent to be particularly useful.  (One uses  her power to select lottery tickets that pay $5, $10, or $20, but that's  it.)<br />The second focus is clearly what Hale found fun to write.  As the  psycho psychic starts popping back in time and messing with the past,  McDonald's becomes spelled MacDonald's, the Watergate scandal never  occurred, and stock market tanks, and &quot;some dork&quot; is in the White  House.  The psycho remembers both versions of the past: the original one,  and the one incorporating his changes.<br />As thrillers go, this is not a  fast-moving or especially chilling novel.  It is, however, an involving  book with a satisfying resolution.  As time travel novels go, this is far  more satisfying than, say, Crichton's &quot;Timeline,&quot; in that much  more thought went into the time travel paradoxes here.<br />[The time travel  aspect here was also featured in an episode of &quot;The Outer  Limits,&quot; where a scientist who discovered the power to time travel  took it upon herself to kill murderers before they committed their  murders.]	1999-12-29
US	52723388	R1X181MZJHTZZU	0805060367	843523115	The White Bone: A Novel	Books	4	11	13	N	N	Well-written but painful and unpleasant	&quot;The White Bone&quot; is a prime example of a book that is extremely well-written, but nevertheless unsatisfying.<br />There is no denying Barbara Gowdy's talent in evoking the world of elephants, their mythology, and  their emotions.<br />At the same time, the book is less of a quest-based plot  than a series of episodes, with mixed in flashbacks.  As a result, there  isn't a feeling of build-up toward a natural climax.  Instead, there is a  gradual erosion of the herd through death, disease, and separation.<br />This  book has been often compared to &quot;Watership Down.&quot;  It's not a  particularly apt comparison.  &quot;Watership Down&quot; is more of a  classic adventure story, with more anthromorphized animal characters.   &quot;The White Bone,&quot; on the other hand, is probably a more realistic  description of elephants as they think, and not as they would think if they  were humans.  Perhaps it's characteristic of my taste in books, but while  I've read &quot;Watership Down&quot; numerous times, I don't see myself  rereading &quot;The White Bone.&quot;  That's not to say it's not a good  book, but it's certainly not pleasant.	1999-12-25
US	52723388	R3EIFV8EFMQWP9	0553576399	15854629	Distraction	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Should have been a better read than it was	Bruce Sterling is a puzzling writer.  He obviously possesses talent and deep thoughts, but the sum of the parts rarely adds up.  I found his non-fiction work, &quot;The Hacker Crackdown,&quot; to be quite  well-written and readable.  And the first short-story in &quot;Crystal  Express&quot; was very entertaining.<br />Too often, however, his books, like  &quot;Holy Fire,&quot; are too byzantine to be truly enjoyable.  It's not a  question of having too much detail, or too many ideas -- qualities present  in Neal Stephenson's more readable work -- there's something inexplicably  inaccessible about some of Sterling's books.<br />&quot;Distraction&quot;  falls somewhere in between.  It never plods, and there are parts where  Sterling's ideas and writing merge into a clarity and power that are  remarkable.  Yet, as a whole, the book never seems to rise above the level  of a mere political thriller, which it clearly does not intend to settle  as.	1999-12-22
US	52723388	R2HOCZFQOZ1YMB	034539657X	855932928	Dark Rivers of the Heart	Books	5	88	93	N	N	The Koontz formula at its best	Here's the typical Dean Koontz novel*: (1) an emotionally tortured, often widowed ex-military or ex-law enforcement guy (2) meets an equally emotionally damaged, often divorced or widowed woman (3) who together  encounter Something Unusual (could be teleportation, alien encounters, time  travel, or genetically engineered animals), and (4) in the course of  understanding/unraveling the Something Unusual, heal each other.<br />The two  best variations on this formula are &quot;Watchers&quot; and &quot;Dark  Rivers of the Heart.&quot;  To give away the Something Unusual here would  take away too much fun, but suffice it to say that there's a psychotic  government (?) assassin running loose with a license to kill, more or  less.<br />What distinguishes &quot;Dark Rivers&quot; is that the paranoid  atmosphere Koontz generates is palpable, and exists even when you are  reading chapters devoted to the assassin.  Second, Koontz's writing really  shines at parts; the first chapter -- go ahead, read it -- resonates with  emotional depth; you really feel the loneliness and desperate hope of the  hero.  The sequence set in Utah with the assassin's ruminations on how to  fit in with the Mormon police officers is unexpectedly (but no doubt  intentionally) funny.<br />While the book is not as explicitly violent as some  of his other works (&quot;Phantoms&quot; and &quot;Hideaway&quot; come to  mind), there are some disturbingly nasty scenes, particularly near the  conclusion, so readers with weak stomachs should proceed cautiously.<br />*  Admittedly, the Moonlight Bay novels (&quot;Fear Nothing&quot; and  &quot;Seize the Night&quot;) have diverged a bit from this.	1999-12-03
US	52723388	RUL81ZRPJTHXM	0385477058	790441627	Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey Through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the 10th Dimension	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Interesting but needed a better chronological approach	&quot;Hyperspace&quot; is a good introduction to superstring theory and its potential implications, such as time machines and parallel universes.  (I was probably drawn to this book because I just finished reading  Crichton's &quot;Timeline.&quot;)<br />Indeed, although much of what  &quot;Hyperspace&quot; covers can be found in other books, the cosmology  section of the book is well-written.<br />Unfortunately, the section  discussing the background and development of superstring theory suffers  from a failure to set forth a clear chronology.  Instead, the author jumps  back and forth among different theories that flourished and then died.  It  was impossible to keep in mind where string theory was, relative to quantum  theory, in say the 1950s.	1999-12-01
US	52723388	R1OH1PT5R0LRL	0385421982	859359548	The Pelican Brief	Books	2	19	27	N	N	A lamer version of &quot;The Firm&quot;	Let me say upfront that I don't think John Grisham is a good writer.  That being said, I thought &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; was a very good book -- not quite at the level of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot; but still  well-written.  I wouldn't call &quot;The Firm&quot; a good book by any  means, but it created an atmosphere of paranoia effectively.<br />&quot;The  Pelican Brief,&quot; however, began a downward slide for Grisham, the  depths of which I stopped monitoring after &quot;The Client.&quot;<br />First,  &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot; is just too much to swallow.  In &quot;The  Firm,&quot; Mitch had the FBI helping him -- sort of -- so you can suspend  some disbelief and think that he might survive his employment with the mob.   But in &quot;The Pelican Brief,&quot; Darby is a second year law student  with no help at all.  It just strains credulity to believe that she could  survive.<br />But that's hardly the worst flaw in the book.  The worst sin  committed herein is that Grisham CHEATS.  In an effort to generate  suspense, he withholds from the reader the information that would explain  why everyone wants to kill Darby Shaw.  Why?  Because of the contents of  the Pelican Brief, which she wrote.  So while Darby knows why everyone is  after her, the reader doesn't find out until two thirds of the way in, when  Grisham finally deigns to share the brief with us.  This is a mark of a  lazy or untalented writer.	1999-11-30
US	52723388	R1C74N7FOFS1ZA	0679444815	786105285	Timeline	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Like dessert, enjoyable at the time, but unfulfilling	It's become common to criticize Crichton's characterization as flat and his writing style as turgid; Ian Malcolm's interminably pedantic lectures in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; come to mind as an example of the  latter.<br />Curiously, &quot;Timeline&quot; suffers from that problem less  than many of its predecessors; yet, it's a less successful work.<br />The  single biggest problem with &quot;Timeline&quot; is that Crichton, though  having obviously spent his time researching quantum mechanics and medieval  history, neglected to put equal thought into his story.<br />**SPOILERS  BELOW**<br />Other reviewers have noted that the entire fulcrum of the plot --  the discovery of a message in 1357 by a present day professor -- is simply  incompatible with the scientific explanation Crichton gives.  As he notes,  time travel is not possible; the &quot;machine&quot; opens a gateway to a  parallel universe.  So how does the professor leave a message in THIS  world?<br />That is the biggest flaw, but not the only one.  Other errors  abound, such as the duel that Hughes inadvertently accepts; Marek then  challenges the person who offered the duel; that person insists that Marek  fight his protector first, and if Marek survives, he can continue; Marek  accepts.  All of a sudden, Marek is fighting the protector, and Hughes is  fighting his original antagonist.  What gives?<br />That being said, I read  &quot;Timeline&quot; in a little over a day over Thanksgiving break.  It's  definitely readable; it's just too bad that Crichton fails to follow his  own pseudo-science.	1999-11-29
US	52723388	R1G858GDNVLB8F	0380973464	555229230	Cryptonomicon	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Outstanding, resonates with math-nerds and non-nerds alike	I felt that with &quot;Cryptonomicon,&quot; Stephenson took a quantum leap forward in the quality of his writing.  In terms of quality of ideas,  &quot;The Diamond Age&quot; was quite good, but in terms of readibility, it  tended to bog down.  &quot;Zodiac&quot; was extremely well-written and had  a puckish quality, but it was not as intricate as the other works.   &quot;Snow Crash&quot; comes the closest to &quot;Cryptonomicon,&quot; but  I personally found the math-encryption angle of &quot;Crypotonomicon&quot;  more compelling than the Sumerian mythology of &quot;Snow  Crash.&quot;<br />The amazing thing about &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; is how  much of a rewrite of U.S. history from pre-World World Two through the  present Stephenson has managed to do.<br />Stephenson's attention to detail  pays off here; terms such as &quot;fractally weird&quot; are inspired  brilliance and stay in the mind long after reading them.	1999-11-25

Although I'm not a big fan of horror novels (with the exception  of Dean Koontz and the occasional Stephen King), I was drawn to the front  cover description (original release) as crossing Raymond Chandler with  &quot;The Exorcist.&quot;  It was a pretty chilling read, but I forgot  about after a while.<br />Then some friends and I rented &quot;Angel  Heart.&quot;  I didn't realize that the movie was based on the novel, but I  had enough subconscious recall of the novel that I found the movie eeriely  predictable.<br />The movie was so-so, the novel rocks.	1999-10-28
