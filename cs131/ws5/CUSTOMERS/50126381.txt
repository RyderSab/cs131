Like many of the other reviewers I was probably about 11/12 when I got hooked on the BSC and I *loved* the early books, especially The Truth About Stacey, and many others.<br />However, I'm not sure I liked the direction that the newer books have taken.<br />Okay, sure every book series updated for the nineties/noughties and different issues were brought into books in order to deal with the changes in society, etc. After all, the books weren't just about the hilarious escapades of the kids they were sitting for but, I just don't think that the BSC series adapted well.<br />I admit that this book is the first BSC book I have read in a long time so, I've probably jumped from reading number 30/40 to 87!<br />Anyways, to get to the point, Stacey didn't seem like that same Stacey in the earlier books, I didn't like her as much in this one. Also, Dawn seemed quite nasty (from what Stacey wrote about her) and at times the characters seemed one-dimensional.<br />I agree that people change - sometimes not for the better but - one great thing was that Stacey joined the BSC again at the end.<br />It's a shame she didn't get a chance to tell her loser ex-friends (the ones who used her) exactly what she thought of them!	2003-10-04

I'd have to say that I personally think that the early SVH books were very well written; focusing on other characters rather than just the Wakefields and their close friends.<BR>Anyway onto the plot. Johanna Porter is a high school drop-out who has spent her time working various jobs including waitressing. However, after the death of her mother, she one day comes across her mother's journal in the attic and is devastated to read about her mother's views on her dropping out of school. She there and then vows to re-enrol at school and succeed in order to fulfil her mother's wishes. <BR>Johanna knows that it will be difficult what with all the students gossiping about her return and her long-time crush Peter DeHaven a brilliant science student who is considered to be one of the brainiest guys in school, dating superficial cheerleader Amy Sutton. Johanna finds it increasingly difficult to become accepted by everyone. She finds solace in Elizabeth Wakefield and confides in her that she and Peter are secretly seeing each other but, is hurt when she thinks that Liz has betrayed her after Amy finds out. <BR>Angry and disappointed when Peter scrawls a note stating that they shouldn't see each other anymore, Johanna finds that this is the final straw and drops out of school for good. Elizabeth tells Peter what has happened and he is torn about what to do, on the one hand he deeply cares for Johanna yet, on the other, he is too scared to let these feelings show. <BR>Will Peter be able to persuade Johanna to return or is she destined to feel like a failure forever?<br />This book dealt with its issues such as insecurity and loneliness incredibly well. I felt that I could really relate to Johanna as she found it difficult to be accepted by her father because, she didn't believe that she was 'special' enough unlike her sister Julie who shared the same interest in music as her father. I was also quite surprised at the ending which wasn't a typical 'girl gets her guy after pining for him a long time'. I personally would have loved to have seen Peter and Johanna get it together but, I think that Johanna needed to deal with her own issues first before getting herself into a relationship. Besides, Peter was a fool for not standing up to Amy and showing his true feelings to Johanna.<BR>All in all, it was a great book and I'd highly recommend it to any SVH fan.	2003-05-24

Jessica Wakefield manages to snag a leading role as Lady M in the school's production of Macbeth.<br />At the same time, a new girl Paula, begins at SVH and quickly becomes Jessica's number 1 fan. Paula manages to infiltrate Jess's snobby clique and also become her understudy.<br />Jessica is more than happy to have someone at her beck and call and Paula seems more than happy to be this.<br />However, underneath Paula's meek and mild mask is a character who is just as devious as Jessica, in fact even more so, as she is planning on sabotaging Jessica's role and grabbing the lead for herself. <br />This book is strongly influenced by \\"All About Eve\\" but, is well worth a read and contains all the typical SV elements that makes the series so well worth reading, even if the books are pretty hard to get ahold of now.	2003-05-18

I have no idea what has happened to the SVU series and I don't know whether this pale imitation of what once used to be a great and interesting series is a joke or whether Francine and Laurie John (if that is a real person and not just a group of really bad writers who once used to be good) are torturing us by attempting to make the series 'hip'.<br />I mean, what is with the popular culture references every five seconds?? I knew I was going to hate the book just from looking at its front cover - that model looks like she belongs in a circus - that awful make-up makes her look like a clown. <br />Anyway, I decided to give the book a chance but, just from reading the opening page in which it was filled with dreadful pop culture references to 'cool' and 'It-girl' actresses such as Neve Campbell, Angelina Jolie and some others - I knew this book was going downhill.<br />Okay, I understand Francine wants to update all the series for the 21st Century but, that doesn't mean that she needs to turn each book into a 200-300 page advertisement for hair products, movie magazines, clothes stores, etc. <br />Also, what has happened to the characters - Denise, Winston, Isabella (bring her back!), Lila, Bruce, Nick (Jess + Nick = perfect couple) and many others. I'd rather Francine develop the old characters rather than introducing new ones just because she cannot be bothered to create more storylines for the old and more INTERESTING characters. <br />The new characters are one-dimensional and simply pale imitations of previous ones. Chloe = Lila, Val = Denise, Martin = Winston and so on. <br />[...]<br />Let's hope she takes notice of what fans have to say.<br />Avoid this stinker at all costs - it's not even a proper SVU book - just a poor man's version.	2001-09-03

It really annoyed me the way he kept referring to Elizabeth as 'that other girl' and how he kept assuming that the only reason why she told him that George had come onto her was because she was jealous.<br />How pathetic - why would Elizabeth be jealous of the relationship Tom had with his father? After all, she was the one that had gone to the effort of reuniting them. Tom is just so ungrateful - if it wasn't for Liz he'd still be stuffing his face at burger joints and wearing jogging bottoms rather than wining and dining at fancy restaurants with that airhead Dana and being able to afford designer clothes now that his father is plying him with money.<br />I'm so glad that Tom's little world is going to come crashing down around him - he deserves it after that way he's been acting towards Liz. <br />Meanwhile, Liz is about to become broken-hearted yet again, due to the fact that Gin-Yung has returned from London with devastating news. It is nice to see Liz and Todd back together but, somehow it just doesn't seem the same. I think Liz should keep looking for Mr. Right.<br />Jessica provides the comedy element to this otherwise depressing storyline with her attempt to be a part of a sexy calender featuring bikini clad girls surrounding Bobby Hornet a sexy singer who just happens to be the judge of the competition. Unfortunately, Jessica who has received blessings from Nick to participate in the calender forget to mention the rather small fact that Bobby is a major part of this shoot.<br />Will Jessica be able to get away without telling Nick the truth? Will Tom wake up and smell/taste the strong and bitter coffee that seems to be heading in his direction? And more importantly, who will Todd choose - Elizabeth or Gin-Yung?	2001-08-15

Let's face it - it was a really good concept but, the book was just so badly written with cliche after cliche being drawn out. I mean, the whole mess was kinda obvious from the start especially after Bruce said he couldn't make it. I mean, this guy supposedly owns half of the US according to the SV books (with the Fowlers owning the other half) I'm sure he wouldn't let something like a plane journey stop him from seeing his beloved Princess Lila.<br />I was hoping that the creepy phone calls would lead onto something interesting but again that was such a letdown. I mean, that 'excuse' was just so lame - it was embarassing. Also, if I was Lila I certainly would NOT be in the mood to forgive - her party was ruined, the electricity went out - ruining the expensive champagne, the phone line was cut (what if there had been a real emergency?!) and she ended up wasting all that money.  Her party was hardly the highlight of the night was it?<br />One thing I really did enjoy was Chloe getting what she deserved (although a very tiny part of me felt sorry for her).

Unlike her sister Janine, Claudia isn't a superbrain she doesn't have the ability to solve Math problems straightaway. She's just a regular teen girl who has problems at school and prefers to veg out and do her own thing. <br />Unfortunately, Claudia encounters some problems and having asked her sister superbrain Janine for help, she still doesn't understand the problem. Jnaine basically gives her the answers - but, that's not what teaching and learning is about. Claudia NEEDS to understand the whole process of solving the Math problems.<br />Anyways, her best friend Stacey decides to help her out but, Stacey starts to patronise Claudia like she's some kind of idiot. To add to this, Claudia starts writing two diaries - one is her own personal diary and the other is about her Math problems and her progress. Stacey asks to look at the Math diary and Claudia gives her the wrong one by mistake. Stacey finds out that Claudia is less than appreciative of her help (Claudia writes that Stacey is acting like a 'pill')<br />Claudia feels that she is alone with her problems - she thinks that no-one else understand how much difficulty she has with school work. Luckily, Claudia is not alone - Shea Rodowsky; one of the sitting charges is also having difficulty at school. He has dyslexia and encounters the same problems as Claudia has. Between them, they both help each other out, and as a result they form a close friendship.<br />A touching BSC book - two thumbs up!	2000-12-15

He's such a hypocrite - he goes around preaching about morals and ethics ('Cruise' trilogy) and yet, here he is - not even visiting his own girlfriend in hospital! Basically, Izzy gets sick and tired of being treated like a kid by Danny (who can blame her) so she decides to let loose at a Sigma party. Unfortunately, she picks the wrong guy to hang out with and ends up smoking a cigarette laced with PCP (a drug which makes you freak out). This drives her to jump off the balcony of the house and poor Izzy ends up with a broken arm and is in danger of ending up in a coma or even worse - having permanent brain damage. Meanwhile, Jess is getting tired of Nick - instead of the thrills and spills she experienced with him when she first met him - he's committed the ultimate sin (in Jess's eyes) and has decided to get a degree in Law. This means a lot of trips to the library for Jessie. Unfortunately, Jess being Jess uses her guy-radar to hunt for more hunks and immediately spots a greasy (my opinion) loser called Clay DiPalma (who looks like Adonis in Jess's eyes). Little does Jess know that Clay is a drug dealer but, luckily before she can get to 'know him better' Nick shows up and knocks the guy out (three cheers for Nick). The biggest surprise of this book is the fact that Tom has done the dirty with dastardly Dana. Unfortunately, Liz being the snoop that she is, finds a box of condoms under Tom's bed and realises that there are seven(!) missing - presumably used. Not only does this tell us that Tommy-boy sure had a wild time with Dana it also tells us that he's not as trustworthy as we all thought so. Liz confronts him after many pages of deliberation and fretting - only for Tom to laugh in her face and deny it all. Poor Liz - little does she know is that Tom is actually LYING to her - the little rat! Watch out for the next couple of books in this series!	2000-11-16

Realising the mix-up, their friends decide to turn the tables and throw a huge surprise party for the both of them. <br />Meanwhile, Olivia decides to surprise her boyfriend Ken Matthews with a portrait of him. Unfortunately, the portrait paints a part of Ken that most pictures don't reach. Objecting to the portrait, Ken and Olivia break-up after he gives her an ultimatum: Their relationship or the portrait.<br />Since all these surprises are being sprung, everyone disregards what will be the biggest surprise of all: The Earthquake.

Thinking that she was going to have a nice but dull summer Elizabeth's surprised to hear that she has won a scholarship to produce and direct her own play in New York. Overjoyed, she rushes to tell Tom, only to realise that she'll have to sacrifice her summer of spending quality time with him.<br />Tom realises her dilemma and after chastising himself for pressuring Elizabeth to give up the chance, he decides to sacrifice his own internship to be with his girlfriend. Unfortunately, things don't turn out the way they planned; Elizabeth feels lost in the big city and intimidated by her fellow playwrights (who are pretentious snobs). She also feels that her relationship with Tom is moving way too fast. <br />Tom, on the other hand, is acting like a BMOC (Big Man In The City) as he keeps reminding Liz that she 'owes' it to him to lose her virginity. His failure to find another internship seems to be preventing him from proving himself as an independent and mature 'man'.<br />Meanwhile, Jessica deluded with visions of grandeur by the fact that she's enrolling into the FSSA (a program which trains people to be bodyguards, etc) is under the impression that she's going to be the next Lara Croft. <br />Unfortunately, she seems to have met her match in Sgt. Vanessa T. Pruitt a drill sargeant who seems to think that she IS Lara Croft. <br />The book definitely has its amusing moments (especially when it focuses on Jessica) but tends to drift mainly between Liz and Tom's trains of thought. This is where it gets slightly tedious, not that I blame Liz for being stressed - I don't think I could handle it if my boyfriend kept pressuring me into something that I wasn't ready for (good for Liz!)<br />Other than that, it's definitely a well-written book. Can't wait to read the next one: Private Jessica - she rocks!	2000-10-27

Todd's supposed to be her 'soulmate' yet, she's going around attracting the attentions of Devon Whitelaw (an arrogant fool who thinks he's too good for Jess).<br />One thing I did love about this book was the fact that Jessica was back to her old scheming witch ways.

Well, as innocent as they can be when you are caught kissing your twin sister's boyfriend. I guess that she felt that she had no other way of convincing Tom that Liz still loves him. I cannot believe that Liz has still not seen through Scott's slimey little act and Tom is just blind to Dana's manipulations (after all he is a guy ;-). I especially felt sympathy for Denise, after all, having had personal experience with the whole credit card sham - Denise isn't really to blame. I guess she was under the illusion that she could spend, spend, spend and not have to worry about the repayments and the interest charged on top of it. I do think that she was acting pretty immaturely especially when she went out to dinner with Winston (SVU # 36) and practically ordered everything on the dessert menu. She was acting like she hadn't seen food before! A definite must-read, this whole Liz-Scott-Tom-Dana love quadratic(?) is really coming to a head! Watch out for Goodbye Elizabeth SVU # 38!	2000-10-24

If he was seriously disturbed (which, he was - believe me, read the book) then I think that from the moment that everyone found out that he had attempted to rape Lila and the other girl Susan Lewis(?) then he should have either have been prosecuted or have been given counselling.  Obviously, since there was no evidence I think that someone like Mr. Collins or even Liz Wakefield (since she's always sticking her nose into everything) should have made him seek help. He obviously had a serious problem, yet no-one even bothered to help him, and I distinctly remember book number #40 Outcast in which Molly Hecht (the girl who hosted the party in which Regina Morrow tragically died after taking cocaine) was planning on running away with some drug dealer because she felt that she had no life in Sweet Valley (especially after everyone was blaming her for Regina's death) Liz went out of her way to prevent her from leaving.  Yet, no-one even bothered to help John, which is especially strange as Amy Sutton works as a telephone counsellor at Project Youth, so you'd think that she might have reccommended it to John at some point or other. Especially since she was practically psychoanalysing Jessica's every move after Sam's death. Other than that, the book was okay but not fantastic - all that stuff that John was doing freaked me out. It's not the type of stuff that you normally read in an SVH book! It reminded me of the 'evil twin' books; creepy and depressing. I did think Steven's 'engagement' to Lila was amusing, I would have loved to have seen the looks on Jess and Liz's faces!	2000-10-24

In an attempt to impress Jessica and to fit in with her snobby clique, Caroline invents a boyfriend.

Also, I can't believe that someone supposedly 'dependable'  and 'caring' as Liz is would just get over Tom so quickly. It doesn't add up with the character that the writers have created. <br />The new books seem to lack the excitement and suspense as well as humour (Winston being 'Winnie') in the books written about their freshman year. I think this lacks the many plotlines created in College Girls #1.<br />Living Together also tended to focus far too much on the twins rather than other characters. Also, the arrival of Chloe bored me, I'd much rather read about Izzy, Denise and even Alison Quinn!<br />The bickering between Sam and Liz was irritating and predictable and Chloe's lying about her relationship with Tom was an old cliche.<br />Predictable and cliched, although some parts were slightly amusing.	2000-10-13

Jessica being the manipulative witch that she is, manages to dupe her dopey twin Elizabeth into going to an audition with her. Once, Elizabeth finally realises what's  going on (about 2 hours later) she makes a scene and storms out. The  Unicorn-headed woman (read the book) nods her approval and assigns Jessica  and Elizabeth the parts of Tiffany and Tammy (or whatever their names  were). Ironically, Jessica is given the part of the sweet and caring twin  (being that she is anything but) and Elizabeth is finally given the chance  to express herself as the nasty and manipulative twin. Soon, Jessica is  parading around Sweet Valley like she owns the place and ends up falling  for the charms of slimey Brandon Hunter, the gorgeous star of the TV  series. Since it is so obvious that Brandon is milking his so-called  romance with Jessica for all its worth, the same cannot be said of  'innocent' Jessie (yeah, right).  Jessica is convinced that she is in love  with Brandon and dumps the ever-dependable Sam Woodruff for a guy who  spends more time looking the mirror than she does. Fortunately, thanks to  her helpful twin, Jessica soon realises that she has been used (yeah right,  like she's never done it to anyone else before) and vows revenge upon poor  ol' Brandon. She exacts her revenge by humiliating Brandon on live  television and at the same time making amends with Sam by declaring her  love for him. Unfortunately, there is no one around to give Jessica a good  dose of reality by slapping her around her smug face and making her realise  what a self-centered jerk she has been. Fortunately, they all live happily  ever after until the next earthquake/death/kidnapping, etc. So, we are  still left with a nice warm fuzzy feeling inside.	2000-06-14

It was amusing to read about the two different sides presented in the on-going debate about beauty pageants. In the blue corner, there's Elizabeth Wakefield; reliable, dependable and downright dull. Obviously,  Liz's morals don't need to be discussed, it's obvious that when it comes to  pageants, Lizzie is no way o-kay! In contrast, the lovely and beautiful and  um...beautiful Jessica Wakefield stands in the red corner. it's obvious  from her blinding talent of um...being beautiful, she's more than o-kay  with beauty pageants (just so long as she can win). Other entrants into  this pageants such as Amy Sutton are not really worth considering since  it's obvious from the outset that no-one in Sweet Valley can come close to  Jessica's blinding beauty - not even her twin (who looks just like her!)  After a few tense arguments around the dinner table, Jessica and Elizabeth  agree to disagree which means that both will continue to irritate and annoy  each other throughout the whole of this book (well, just until the  pageant). An amusing read.	2000-06-14

The main reason why I enjoy the University series so much, is because it seems to allow the development of serious issues such as racism, date rape, sex, and so on. This particular book explores the notion of date rape and  is developed particularly well with Jessica falling for handsome and  athletic James Montegomery, a guy who seems too good to be true.  Unfortunately, it seems that James is a guy with a few skeletons in his  closet and it's up to Elizabeth to reveal the truth to Jessica before it's  too late.	2000-06-12

When Tom Devlin an old college friend of Ned Wakefield gives one of the twins an opportunity to spend some time in New York, the twins jump at the chance. Unfortunately for Elizabeth, she allows herself to be cajoled into  giving up her chance to allow Jessica the opportunity to go and live the  high life. Whilst Jessica spends time in New York, the Devlins' daughter  Suzanne, will spend time with the Wakefields. Elizabeth is delighted at the  prospect of meeting Suzanne and is not disappointed with her arrival.  Suzanne on the surface seems a beautiful and sweet person but, deep down  she proves herself to be a manipulative witch. Soon, she has almost the  whole of SVH under her spell apart from the one person that she seems to  want most - the handsome faculty advisor Roger Collins. Suzanne manipulates  the situation so that she ends up babysitting for Mr. Collins' son Teddy.  When Mr. Collins arrives home, Suzanne tries to seduce him but he rejects  her advances. Suzanne swears revenge and runs home to Elizabeth where she  tells her that Mr. Collins attacked her. Elizabeth is heart-broken at the  thought of her favourite teacher being accused of such a crime and sets out  to find out the truth. She soon discovers that there's more to Suzanne then  it seems. Will Elizabeth be able to clear Mr. Collins name in time? Or will  Suzanne have her wicked ways? Meanwhile, Jessica realises that New York is  the perfect opportunity to convey her new sophisticated image and attempts  to impress Suzanne's friends with her looks. Unfortunately, Jessica ends up  making a fool of herself by drinking far too much and passing out. She also  tries to seduce Suzanne's boyfriend but he seems far more interested in the  paint on the walls. Will Jessica be able to pull off her sophisticated  image or will she get in over head? Reccommended - even if it is slightly  melodramatic.	2000-06-12

Much as I love Liz and Tom, I just wish that they would use their B-R-A-I-N-S and T-A-L-K with each other. It's so annoying that they cannot have an adult conversation without resorting to silly insults. And what is it with Dana and Scott? Can't Liz and Tom (two intelligent beings -  supposedly) see what manipulative creeps they are? Especially Dana, I mean,  if she loves Tom so much - why is she hiding things from him?  Scott is  just a jerk, it's so obvious that he's just using Liz as a trophy rather  than a girlfriend. Jessica should just wake up from La-La land, I mean,  what is she on? Police work is certainly not fun - not if someone has a gun  to your head. But, I do think that Nick is good for her maybe he'll calm  her down a bit.

It was interesting to read a book about teens that doesn't conform to the usual stereotypes of boy meets girl, etc. Not only that, it was also very powerful in terms of expressing the emotions  that the characters felt.

I thought it was pretty amusing that Robin managed to lose allthat weight in the space of about 2 or 3 chapters. Other than that,the book was well written in terms of conveying Jessica and the other Pi Beta's two-faced snobbishness. Although I do think that Robin was partly to blame, due to the fact that she wouldn't tell Jessica and the Pi Betas where to get off.  I mean, they completely humiliate her, yet she still kept after them. I also didn't like the way Robin reacted to Liz, I mean, yeah, Jessica treated her like dirt but, I don't know how Robin had the nerve to accuse Liz as well. It was Liz who was trying to stop her from making a fool of herself.  END	2000-05-19

I think there's more to this book (and the rest of the SV books) than most people think. Yes, the twins are perfectly formed and have amazing lives, friends and so on but, this book seems to convey the double standards that  some of the characters (mainly Jessica Wakefield) live by. It seems that  Annie is labelled as 'Easy' because she tends to have a casual 'date' every  night of the week, but Jessica herself claims (in almost every book) that  she's bored with the 'guys' in Sweet Valley because she's dated most of  them. Therefore, rather than being a 'perfect' creation of Francine  Pascal's imagination, Jessica is anything but. She's hypocritical,  superficial, nasty - yet, she's a cheerleader and one of the most popular  girls in the school.  It seems to suggest that maybe being 'perfect' isn't  as great as it seems.	2000-05-10

I liked the way the book conveyed Enid's jealousy of Amy but, also at the same time, she was portrayed as being insecure and threatened by the return  of Liz's 'best friend'. I liked the 'showdown' at the party when Amy keeps  hassling poor old Christopher for a ride, when he just wants to be with  Enid. I did feel a bit sorry for Liz, especially since she was caught  between them.	2000-05-08

I  am so glad he's left SV in fact, I have no idea why he was introduced in  the first place.  The ending was kind of sad, especially now that there are  going to be no more SVH books being written but, I have heard that SVH  Senior Year is actually pretty good.  Oh well...sob, sniff....R.I.P.

I definitely agree with the other readers, this book is great for those cold nights ;-) I thought the dreams that the twins and their cousin Robin  had from wearing the necklace were pretty creepy. I also liked the blend of  humour and horror from the writers. Like when Jess is trying to tell the  Unicorns that she's gotten a part in a movie and Lila's too busy screeching  about Jess and Ellen using her hairspray. Also, that annoying brat that was  the 'star' of the film, she was so funny. Especially when Jess threw that  cake at her, and everyone else joined in.  I also thought it was quite sad  too, especially when the ghost and her sister got together after all that  time. A good read for any SV fan, you won't be disappointed.	2000-04-12

It seems to me that Liz is pretty sure of herself, I mean, why is her way always seen as the 'right' way? I don't think it was, and I think that what Jess did was pretty brave. Lois was pretty brave too, especially when she stood up to Janet's snobbiness in the restaurant and also at the night of the party.

I thought that everyone's reaction to Lila's story was particularly truthful. Especially since some of her closest friends refused to believe that it really happened. It seems such a shame that Lila had to get another girl as evidence. I mean, if these so-called friends of hers had believed her in the first place, then she wouldn't have had to suffer. I definitely recommend this book to others. It also questions the notion of friendship as well as date rape.	2000-04-07

I found the beginning of the 'Cruise' trilogy absolutely hilarious. I couldn't believe what Tom did. It does seem a little strange that he would just go for another girl, especially since he is supposed to be so in  &quot;love&quot; with Liz. Nina and Bryan are particularly irritating in  this series, it annoys me that Bryan is portrayed as this control freak.   Anyway, Danny and Isabella are having problems, especially since Isabella  insists on sticking up for Tom Watts (guess she still hasn't gotten over  her crush on him). Personally, I'd like to see Isabella and Tom get  together, they'd make such a cute couple. Also, Elizabeth's tendency to be  'perfect' can get a tad annoying, I wish she would just relax and take it  easy. I don't know why she's going for Todd, he's a complete loser, and not  to mention the fact that he dumped Liz at the beginning of college for the  same reason that Liz is annoyed at Tom.

I really liked the way the book managed to convey Liz's feelings about moving away and starting over at University.  I didn't like the fact that Jessica was acting inconsiderate, I mean I know she can be a bit rude but, it was nasty of her to move in with Isabella rather than stay with her own  sister. It also annoyed me that Enid felt the need to change her name just  so that she could be 'cool'. I think she was pretty ungrateful to Liz after  all Liz had done for her during her time at SVH. If you ask me, Liz is  better off without her anyway. Todd just irritated me, and I was so glad to  see the arrival of sexy Tom Watts. I loved the chemistry between him and  Liz - they definitely make a great team. Todd deserves airhead Lauren.  Liz's roommate Celine is so funny, I loved her 'drama queen' persona. But,  I have to admit that if I lived with her, I probably would have strangled  her. Alison Quinn is also irritating as well - snobby witch. You just know  that she's out to make trouble for the Wakefields - especially Jess. I was  disappointed to see that some of my favourite characters were missing but,  I'm sure they'll soon turn up at some point or other in the series. I  highly reccommend this series.

If I was Liz I would have made Enid grovel for my forgiveness. Liz is too soft. She's also too dumb - I mean,  it was sooo obvious that Jess wanted to be voted Prom Queen.

Liz, on the other hand, tries a new  'image' and ends up improving herself but only for her ambitions to be shot  down by Leona.

SVH definitely took a new turn when Francine introduced Margo Black as a character. It made this 'series' a lot darker. I found Margo incredibly disturbing with the way, she would dispose of the children/people with such  ease. I also found the 'voices' that she heard to be pretty creepy as well.  I assume that she was supposed to be a schizophrenic. I think Francine did  well with this new character but, at the same time, I don't think she  should have turned SVH into something serious. I've always found the series  lighthearted and amusing, sometimes thrilling. Yet, this 'series' of Margo  stories were creepy and disturbing. I mean, this character was pretty  violent, yet at the same time she looked like Liz and Jess. I found that,  that just made it kinda dumb. I think that she should have wanted to take  over their lives without looking like them. It would have made it a lot  creepier..	2000-02-07

I know a lot of people criticise the Sweet Valley books for being 'unrealistic', etc. That's just what they're supposed to be - pure escapism. I love this book and all the other early books - they're  fantastically politically In-correct. I mean, Jessica is such a complete  witch but, you can't help rooting for her. Liz is also a great sympathetic  character but, at the same time, you can't help wanting to give her a slap.  I agree with the previous reviewer about the SV series becoming 'hip'. It's  a shame.

I'd definitely reccommend reading this  SV book - and any other early books you can get hold of.	2000-02-02
