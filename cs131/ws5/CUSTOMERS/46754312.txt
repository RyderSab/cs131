US	46754312	R1V5OE2GXW7FCE	1883285240	590414129	Virginia Lovers	Books	2	5	9	N	N	Sorry that I can't rave about it	While it seems unlikely and isn't popular to berate a praised literary writer, I thought this book missed its mark.<br /><br />The story of a family in the 1970s dealing with a murder, the book perhaps best captures a frustrated father's life as a small-town newspaper editor. His relationship with his wife, though she is peripheral as a character, is interestingly drawn. They have 2 sons, Danny, who we figure and later discover is gay and who is the \\"good son,\\" and Pete, the wild one. That easy stereotype bothered me.<br /><br />A good re-thinking and re-doing of this story could have made it great. The quiet desperation throughout the novel is not particularly unique, especially for literary fiction. It is only a \\"gay\\" novel because the murder victim is an effeminate gay teen and Danny is gay. That theme simply feels applied artifically to the story. This is actually a novel about the father.<br /><br />Also, why the 1970s? There were a few weak references to the times, and the murder of a tormented gay teen could easily still happen these days. To me, if an author picks an era to portray, there had better be a good reason.<br /><br />The story is not 100 percent dull, but the characters of the two sons and their eventual closeness is by far the most interesting aspect of the story. The murder aspects felt like an editor or someone suggested to \\"beef up\\" the story. The father going into the police station to find out more details now & again almost felt like a cookie-cutter mystery that had been cut-and-pasted into a literary read. And the endless details of who was where, and who really did it, and not rendered as a surprise, and you will probably find you don't care much.<br /><br />The climax? A disappointment. While Danny's thoughts at the story's resolution are rich and good, the ending \\"incident\\" feels like someone rubber-stamped the manuscript, \\"Put climax to the story here and make it dramatic.\\"<br /><br />There are many other better books out there. Don't get this if you're looking for a gay-themed novel, because you'll be disappointed. But if you like literary novels about family life, this might suit you.here.

Far away from the typical gay fare involving Hollywood dreams, turning tricks, and frequenting the gym, this is the gripping tale of timid, obedient 16-year-old Bilal Abu.<br /><br />An Iraqi-American living in the heartland, he lives an insulated life with his family. They struggle to get by, Bilal selling his mother's popular home-baked bread at local stores, and his older brothers Salim and Hakim holding down blue-collar jobs.<br /><br />Salim, at 26, has been the head of the family since their father's death in Iraq at the hands of Saddam Hussein's forces. But they don't find much sympathy in Kansas City, with suspicious eyes watching their brown skin and suspicious minds knowing only all Iraqis as the enemy--not understanding or caring to know the difference between a Kurd, a Sunni, and a Shiite.<br /><br />Bilal is of sexual service to Salim, who treats his abuse of Bilal as a secret cultural ritual.  Bilal's feelings are unflinchingly honest. He struggles to understand his intuition that servicing his brother is wrong, while perceiving that there is something he deeply enjoys about a sexual relationship his domineering, muscular older brother. When Bilal meets a classmate, Muhammad, and learns of the beauty of sex plus love, his future becomes clearer...though certainly not easier.<br /><br />Fatima, Bilal's wise older sister, helps Bilal as best she can, while struggling with her own desire to rid herself of the veil, and some Iraqi ways, to be the strong American woman she sees herself becoming.<br /><br />The story intertwines cleverly. Salim becomes more violent toward his family members, especially Bilal. Family secrets from past days in Iraq spill, clarifying Salim's deeper, darker role in the changes wrenching their lives. In contrast to Bilal's tenderness with Muhammad is the fracturing of Bilal's family and the necessary intervention of a local Islamic leader.<br /><br />Rarely do we get a gem like this that blends a strikingly memorable story with a great cultural learning experience. No review can really do it justice. Captivating in its style, and daring in its content, it will surely become a classic of gay lit and perhaps a landmark young-adult book, too.d the necessary intervention of a local Islamic leader. <br /> <br />Rarely do we get a gem like this that blends a strikingly memorable story with a great cultural learning experience.

On the scene is Iggy, an outwardly gay youth who is tormented at school.<br /><br />While it might sound like a typical young-adult novel, it certainly is not. Author Alex Sanchez thought this through throughly before writing. The evolution of emotions blossoms perfectly, revealing growth and its counterbalancing immaturity at the same time. Most writers wouldn't take on the story of such a young teen's coming out. But Sanchez does it with incredible skill and inimitable grace.	2005-09-10

Michael Van Allen is a young man who is awash in successful relatives-his father is a famous composer, his mother a well-known painter, and his siblings Karl and Sara are, respectively, an attorney and columnist. It's not for not trying-Michael has taken several paths in the arts to try for success, and now works as a file clerk.<br /><br />Michael wakes up in a mental hospital, where he's received treatment supposedly after screaming through one of his father's concerts. But he can't remember anything-nothing about his past, nor why he has a partner, Paul. It's like being in a world of strangers-only they know all about you! This imaginative concept provides a gripping read. It's especially captivating when Michael discovers his old journal and begins reading the entries. Somehow, reading his own words about his past rekindle dark emotions.<br /><br />This had to be a challenging story to write, and, fortunately for us, was brilliantly done.	2005-03-30

Don't expect tremendous depth, but it is a good \\"beach read.\\" Or, if you are the soap opera type, you'd like this, because it has varying storylines and reaches dramatic highs and lows.<br /><br />Mike, the bartender, finds his path crosses with a priest, Thomas, who is just discovering his true nature. Both are looking for love. Stephen, a shy accountant who is too close to his parents (emotionally and geographically), is nearing a point in his life where everyone must know the truth. John and Russell are a committed couple finding their relationship is stale, and maybe not permanent. Simon is the wise \\"old queen\\" that younger gays run to for advice. In his 60s, he misses his longtime companion and believes that love is in his past because of his age. Pete Thayer is one of most interesting characters, bringing a dark and dangerous element to the story. He seems to be bi, but has a hatred for gays, especially after he rapes them.<br /><br />If you like the humor, hunt, and cattiness of bars, this will appeal to you, because a healthy chunk of the book takes place in the bar where Mike works, and has many scenes of the characters sitting, drinking and talking. The storyline with Simon was brave and rare, covering what seems like a very realistic life of a gay senior. I think the John and Russell portion could have been  completely left out of the book, but the good thing is you can fast-read through the slower portions and get to the parts you like. And I don't just mean the love scenes. While those scenes seem inserted rather than a natural outflow of the story, they will surely please the readers who like red-hot juiciness in their storyline. Just be aware that some of those scenes are graphically straight/bi (Pete's situation) and horrifyingly violent (again, Pete).	2005-03-30

This fetching coming-of-age novel is set in Boulder, Colorado in the early 1970s. The actions and beliefs of the times (actually, the whole environment) is very well-done and feels authentic. You feel like you're going back to that time. King is trying to become a successful writer (a too-common element of any novel, but we can overlook that) and becomes acquainted with a gay activist, Theo. King's new place in Theo's apartment building opens up the story to show us King's good friend Jen, King's mother (a typical chain-smoking mom of the era), and others. While there are trysts and tears, the story is peppered with the growing gay-rights movement activism. King discovers a surprising truth about his father that heightens the story.<br /><br />The characters are well-drawn, and the story is as well-hewn as a magnificently carved statue. I could actually read a series of books about this character throughout his adult life, which is something I can't say about everything I read.	2005-03-30

This one is about both growing up and coming out, but has a universal appeal beyond the typical coming-out story. Mason, from a small Mississippi town, is a shy teen with feelings for his best friend, Billy. Billy is a bold, clever guy that perhaps Mason would like to be-or just wants, period.<br /><br />Mason's boring summer changes when his Aunt Savannah suggests he come to New Orleans to visit for the summer.

But that's only the backdrop: it's really more the story of how lives can change suddenly and dramatically. The setting, mostly, is the upscale world of New York diners, who treat the gay waiters like their servants. The guys cope with the advent of this strange new disease and the new out-there protest group (ACT-UP) that appears.<br /><br />The main character, Lee, is attracted to this vocal, policy-changing mob, and feels like with social activism, he might have found his passion in life. Other characters are equally colorful: Brian, who tries life as a hustler; a club-hopper boy, a bi-curious sculptor, and more.<br /><br />It's a colorful, detailed look at a moment in time in our history--with all the laughs, tears and drama you'd expect.	2005-03-25

This is the third book about Taylor and Tom, starting with \\"Finding Faith\\"  and then \\"Finding Peace.\\" It's been about five years since the beginning of the first book. It's not a requirement to have read the first book (I didn't realize this was a series till I'd already bought it), since there is a synopsis about what has happened.<br /><br />Tom McEwan is a professor, and Taylor Connolly is a successful lawyer in the town of Pine Creek. It's not a typical anti-gay small town. There is now some warmth and acceptance, which apparently was not true at the beginning of their time in the town. But the town is threatened by an aggressive real estate developer who also plans to oust the Mayor, Gen, a friend of Tom and Taylor's.<br /><br />A subplot is that of Wayne, a teen Tom and Taylor took in earlier, and Wayne's lover, Eric, who has been away at Ohio State.<br /><br />It's an engrossing story about the goings-on within a family and with their friends and neighbors in small-town America. Ironically, it has a sort of \\"Ozzie and Harriett\\" feel, with the twist that this is about a gay couple with kids who live in that small town.	2005-03-25

Cole Seavey is viciously attacked by what we later find is a wendigo, a beast some previously thought was mythical.<br /><br />Cole is strongly attracted to Pakim, the young Indian who saves him and takes him to the house of John Chapman (from the author's previous gay western novel). The love scenes in the story aren't gratuitous or poorly-inserted porn scenes; they're the result of a natural progression of the characters. While I somewhat felt we were told, more than shown, that Cole was \\"cold-hearted Cole\\" at least we fully see his gradual change.<br /><br />This is a page-turner that has strong elements of horror and mystery. The town of Hugh's Lick is downright creepy, and the who-is-next factor with the wendigo is chilling. It's an absorbing, engaging read. And kudos to the author for successfully blending genres and providing a fresh environment for a gay story.	2005-03-22

It's the story of Pyrrhus, son of Achilles, in a story set during the Trojan War-yet with modern sensibilities. Pyrrhus might put on his khaki pants or use a credit card, but they are, indeed, in ancient Greece.<br /><br />The story is well-woven and keeps your interest. Unless you are used to high-concept novels, it will take a few pages to meld the new and the old as the author intended. But it comes across well. Pyrrhus becomes disillusioned with the constant stream of one-nighters, and when called upon (as prophesied) to conquer Troy, he gets involved in battle. Even if you know ancient Greek history, the outcome of the war in this book will surprise you. Of course, there's still the hot love scenes one would expect.<br /><br />A great read, especially if you're looking for gay fiction that's different from the usual.	2005-03-22

Obviously, Hensley has distilled the most brilliant and effervescent remarks from his real-life screening parties for this story. These funny characters do more than just crack Sedarisque lines about movies; you see the changes in their lives as the story progresses.<br /><br />This is a calculated mix of movie commentary and storyline, though more oriented for those who want the cultural analysis rather than the story. It's an especially vivid snapshot of mid-70s to early 80s pop culture. Even movies you thought were great get roasted via the sass-spatula from these wacky grillers.	2005-03-22

I was uncertain I'd like this book because I like the unusual, and a story about a \\"player\\" gay man didn't sound unique. However, I was surprised. It is a strong story with interesting twists and well-hewn character progession.<br /><br />We see Tony Romero's life, that of a casanova who hunts for an O.O.D. (object of desire), bags him, then tires of him once he's feasted enough. His modus operandi is particularly sharp--using artistic ability, flirting, and a carefully calculated system that lands `em every time. But Tony is changing, slowly. He begins to see what it's doing to other people, his wacky family, and himself.<br /><br />It almost seems like a contrivance that Tony has a Mexican grandmother, Danish mother (who got stranded with her mother-in-law), a black brother, Cleve, and Peter, the \\"stepfather.\\" Their house is a mixture of languages, changes, and racing dogs (I can't explain it, you'll just have to read about it!) that's both endearing and funny.<br /><br />Each of Tony's ex's are colorful and different and shed light on how Tony operates and the often-messy results. Particularly interesting is Tom, the bike messenger who rides on the edge of his very raw emotions and has clever methods of revenge. Tom's toothbrush trick is just one of the many inventive, funny surprises that fill this book.<br /><br />While there is the plot of who-shot-Tony, I was only mildly worried about that while I immersed myself in Tony's activities and reflections on his past. This novel is at a higher level of writing than most gay novels today; it's even sort of a shame that the publisher promotes it as a gay romance novel. It's much more than that.	2005-03-13

I read and read and read this book, waiting to feel that Mike Albo had \\"talent to burn,\\" like another reviewer said. This is a story about growing up gay, which might seem well-trod but which is always interesting and can be clever.<br /><br />However, I struggled mightily to follow this book. To me it read like a first draft. There are numerous ill-placed flashbacks that drag an already-thick narrative even further down so that it's very hard to follow. Sure, there are mentions of things that will remind you of the times, but it's not enough. You have to care about the narrator and care where he goes in life.<br /><br />The humor here is somewhat subtle and dry, but nowhere near David Sedaris' level. When the attempt at a writing style gets in the way of the writing, it doesn't work.	2005-03-13

It's not easy, and Craig's domineering mother definitely tries to stand in the way. When he finds Craig, whom we already know has a long-time lover named Clayton, he has a big decision. Should he steal his long-ago love (who is still cute and now is very successful) or respect Craig's relationship?<br /><br />There are some great surprises. One is when Travis finds someone significant connected to Craig first, and what happens. Another is the end. I predicted a couple of different outcomes, neither of which happened!<br /><br />This is not populated with the typical gay characters. Gordo, A.J., a runaway child, a baseball player named Jody, and other characters show the inventiveness behind this story.<br /><br />Kluger is the author of a baseball-themed novel, and there's a light baseball theme in this book.

I also liked the well-drawn setting, California's high desert. The novel progresses well and keeps the reader interested. Ryan's grandmother dies, adding a twist to the story and giving him a challenge to deal with.<br /><br />These characters seem very real, the dialogue is crisp, and the events are believable.

This book is a snappy series of short chapters that give an interesting, multi-layered look at a young man growing up in Virginia in the 1980s. The many references in the book to that era will really resonate with those who grew up with them, and for those who didn't, there are many universal themes you'll recognize.<br /><br />The chronological thing didn't bother me: he seemed to arrange the events in a way that is intelligent. I do see a bit of David Sedaris in this writing, but this is entirely different than Sedaris' stuff.<br /><br />I thought Kirk's refreshing, positive handling of circumstances was nice `n' different.

It's not about stats, nor does it have the boringly-detailed replays of long-ago games that die-hard fans like. It's about Jose Canseco's years in baseball, and the use of steroids during that time.<br /><br />It is particularly juicy that he mentions so many other players--people like Mark McGwire, Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, and Jason Giambi certainly go under the microscope here--but the more interesting part is his own choice to use steroids and how it helped his career. The drawback is that something is obviously missing, especially in the parts about his dislike of Cal Ripkin. Perhaps the publisher's lawyers bleached out some of the wilder details. Of course, some things were a disappointment. He didn't really have an affair with Madonna. He is bold to say he was the \\"best\\" player in baseball; people who really are don't have to say it. There is a tone of bitterness and whining in many parts of this book.<br /><br />There seems to be heavy criticism of Canseco for: (a) naming others and possibly slashing their reputations; and (b) his bad influence in talking about steroids in a positive way. But face it, every autobiography is subjective, and his stance on steroids seems believable. It would be hypocritical for him to preach that they're bad just for the sake of political correctness when he doesn't feel that way! Do you prefer censorship?<br /><br />The best parts of the book were the more emotion-tugging parts about his family. His father was rough on him, and his mother died when he was a teenager. He probably did experience prejudice in baseball then--it's hard for us to believe now, but that was years ago. And though he had repeated marriages, it's clear that there were very real hurts at times (like when his 2nd wife left him) and there is his near-suicide.<br /><br />Call it what you will, but at least it's fascinating to read.e is his near-suicide.

He emerges as a likable, growing man who transcends his upbringing and faces the future on his own.	2005-01-31

Jack Barillo finds that men from his past are getting killed one by one (warning to the squeamish: this ain't Agatha Christie's type of killings--these are startlingly detailed). The killer, Lucifer, seems to be the type who can't be escaped.<br /><br />I was interested in the Chicago settings, since I'm from there, but the environment in Amsterdam and Italy are also very well-done. Jack thinks he can get away from Lucifer by hiding out in Europe, then finds out that even his best-laid plans are laid open for exploitation. I look forward to more thrillers from this author!	2005-01-31

The excitement of eroticism is there, but more important, this is more a book of lonely hearts. The characters you will meet in these stories, a dog-walker, teenager at camp, volunteer to the nursing-home set, prisoner on death row, and more, all in one way or another are dealing with unrequited love.<br /><br />Some scenes are sad, some are funny, and some just plain sizzle. Don't consider this as \\"porn\\"--it's a collection of stories about the surprising twists and turns that life takes, and how various people deal with them. I would have enjoyed even more of these stories in this gem of a volume.	2005-01-31

This has all the spice of Tex-Mex, the pathos of going home to Mom, and small-town hickness that will have you rollicking with laughter--and empathy! It's the story of Clu, a somewhat successful 30-something New Yorker, who returns to his small hometown in Texas (called \\"Grit\\" of all things). His mother has cancer, but that doesn't stop the announcement of an impending marriage to a minister. Clu has to overcome small-mindedness, getting the hometown to accept Chris, his lover (who happens to be psychic) and has to deal with his redneck brother and ever-pregnant sister.

It's the story of 18-year-old Adam, on the verge of graduation, his best friend, Dart, and how transitions in life can occur suddenly and dramatically--though all can turn out for the best more easily than you might think.<br /><br />Part of the plot is Adam meeting Jeff, a 38-year-old police officer, and their tentative, even burgeoning, romance. While they carefully explore the possibility of getting together, despite high obstacles, Adam's friend Dart looks for love of his own.<br /><br />The teenage dialogue is right on the mark and the love scenes sizzle. This isn't a light-fluff gay romance novel, but a meaningful, thoughtful story of lives that intersect.	2005-01-31

How about a killer who sends a body part from each victim in the mail? That's what happens to Dan Caruso, a newspaper columnist who is married and closeted. He tricks with ferocity, his unrequited lust burning within him and driving him to risky choices. He finds that men he has slept with are getting murdered--and the body parts he receives are the gruesome bonus.<br /><br />He goes to a police detective for help--of course, it's a guy he has tricked with. The investigation delves into a seamy world of dark bathhouses and S&M bars. Why the killer is tormenting Dan is central to this suspenseful story. The writing is lean and keeps pulling you through page after page. You'll find yourself drawn to this creepy, unusual story and maybe even breathless by the end.	2005-01-31

But what's going on under the sheets--uh, I mean, between the covers of the book--is a fun, juicy romp. It's the story of Blake Jackson, who becomes a male model at the behest of Cameron Fuller, a Ralph Lauren-type. Cameron has more on his mind than advancing Blake's career. He wants to jump into his pants. Their torrid love affair is complicated by the fact that Cameron is in the closet and is married to money. His father-in-law's money, in fact, helped get him where he is.<br /><br />As things progress, they get more complicated, and the reader wonders what decisions Blake will make. Life as a male model is not all easy-breezy and easy money, as you'll find here.  Blake has something to help him get by, though: the sex scenes crackle with white-hot electricity. This entertaining, fast-moving story will keep you enthralled...and wanting more.	2005-01-31

If you've been reading these books, you'll find the character doing some self-reflection that is different than the previous books. If you haven't read the other books, you will enjoy this twisty mystery.<br /><br />Mark Manning, a journalist, sits on the board of a local company whose CEO, Gillian Reece, is definitely not the winner of the Miss Congeniality award. That's only one of the reasons she gets a bitch slap from character Glee Savage. Later, though, Reece is found murdered. Further complicating the stew is the fact that Mark's lover, Neil, is designing a house for Reece.<br /><br />Didn't Glee kill Reece? You won't have a clue--and you won't guess how this turns out till you read it. The outcome is definitely a shocker, and will have you pondering the meaning of justice. Definitely a captivating, exciting mystery.	2005-01-31

It could be called a coming-out story, but it's much more than that. Not only is Neill dealing with the unraveling of his suburban family, he is still in the shadow of his golden-boy brother, Peter, who has multiple surgeries due to cancer. Neill's only release seems to be Vince, a druggie character who lives on the edge. These trysts seem to be his only relief in his world, which is chaos.<br /><br />Eventually, Neill has to make a choice to allow his definition of himself to be known to all, regardless of the outcome. The fact that one can take the high road (which is hard) or the low road, which is the easy way out, is at the crux of this touching, interesting book.	2005-01-31

The first part is about the history of Buddhism, which isn't the most interesting thing I ever read, but was informative. Part 2 is about basic Buddhist themes, such as the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. Part 3 is about putting Buddhism into practice in one's daily life and is very practical and patient.<br /><br />If you're already at the intermediate level with Buddhism, this will be too simple for you. But if you've only learned meditation or had a general idea about Buddhism, this is very enlightening and concise.	2005-01-21

He deeply loves his mother, who is rather unattached to everything, it seems, and they both blame themselves for the death. Matthew also finds facts about his mother's past that make him suspicious of her ability to tell the truth.<br /><br />Matthew has an addiction to a phone sex line to meet anonymous lovers. Later he meets a nice guy, Henry, and almost sabotages it with his distrust. I had to pull myself through the book. The emotions seem a bit muted, the characters somewhat colorless (though not entirely), and there is certainly no uniqueness to the plot or environment. Also, Matthew's references to name-brand this and that is a very tired gay novel cliche.<br /><br />I dislike being negative about a first-time fiction author, but this falls short of the mark for me. A book can be \\"quiet\\" and still be great (witness \\"Cold Mountain\\" by Charles Frazier) and gay novels don't all have to be a wild sex romp or have a crazy plot. But this book was neither.<br /><br />Surprising here are the remarks that it's a \\"great beach read\\" or \\"light, easy reading.\\" It's not. Nor is it a highly literary read: often the dialogue falls into the trite. The author needs to focus on which scenes need to be condensed and how to drive a sharper plot, even in a book primarily about quiet emotions.	2005-01-21

It truly is pretty funny. It's a series of essays about his wacky family, living in France, and being on the subversive side of a very straight-laced U.S.<br /><br />The book cover blurbs oversold it. I read reviewers say they \\"screamed with laughter\\" or found it \\"sidesplitting\\" or \\"wildly entertaining.\\" It's mildly entertaining. Don't expect to scream with laughter.<br /><br />You also have to suspend your belief to some degree. Exaggeration is okay but it's probably a major part of this autobiographical book. The first half is about growing up and adult life, and the second half is about life in France. There's not a lot of continuity here: it's truly a random collection of essays.<br /><br />I don't want to leave a totally negative impression. Let me tell you two of my favorite lines from the book:<br /><br />\\"...my childhood was unspeakably dull. When I was seven years old, my family moved to North Carolina. When he was seven years old, Hugh's family moved to the Congo. We had a collie and a house cat. They had a monkey and two horses named Charlie Brown and Satan.\\"<br /><br />Another, about a speech therapy class for boys with lisps: \\"When asked what we wanted to be when we grew up, we hid the truth and listed who we wanted to sleep with when we grew up: `A policeman or a fireman or one of those guys who works with high-tension wires.'\\"	2005-01-21

This book is about the themes of having hope (and maintaining it), creating happiness and forgiving the hurts of the past. Of course, these are not new themes, especially from Marianne Williamson, but it's always so soothing and renewing to read her words.<br /><br />Lightly touching on \\"A Course in Miracles,\\" Williamson shows how we can reframe our view of the universe and how we fit in it. She's right on about how many of us start our day--getting wrapped up in hectic news and things outside of us. A good day, and a good life, starts from within.<br /><br />I always appreciate references to spiritual texts of all faiths, but this book also used Cinderella and Snow White as metaphors, which I found elementary and perhaps even forced. Also, the use of techniques being called \\"wands\\" (as in magic wands) was strange and not really necessary.	2005-01-12

It's about a gay man who has \\"father hunger\\" and decides to adopt a child. As it turns out, he has to get a special-needs kid (perhaps better classified as SUPER special-needs), an 8-year-old boy who truly thinks he's from Mars.<br /><br />Does that mean you need to be a sci-fi fan to read this book? I don't think so at all. Sci-fi fans will like it, I think, but parents will especially love it. However, anyone who has ever fallen in love will find it resonates with them too--even if they don't have children in their lives.<br /><br />\\"The Martian Child\\" is chock full of surprises. I can easily predict a storyline (since I'm a writer) but this one constantly took me in all different directions. I expected the boy, once he got home, to tear the house apart and create a living hell. Instead, he created a living heaven. But it doesn't stop there--most twists and turns happen, and even the fact that the kid thinks he's a Martian, and the result, turns out to be a refreshing, intelligent surprise.<br /><br />Apparently this is based on the author's own true story. It's a gripping book I certainly recommend.	2005-01-12

This met my needs--a thrilling page-turner that's a fine blend of sci-fi (without too much science) and suspense. I heard about this after finding it was a Lambda award winner in 1991. After reading it, I'm surprised it won a \\"gay\\" award--though that occurs in the book, it's in the context of how all of society feels. I wouldn't call it a \\"gay\\" novel.<br /><br />The story is of 17-year-old Sparrow, who, after an accident, has no memories. He's on a ship called the Astron, which has been in space for centuries looking for other life. As others and events begin to seem vaguely familiar, he discovers a secret movement aboard--some want to go back to earth. They've been to hundreds of planets and found nothing and believe earth truly is the only source of life.<br /><br />Things are at a crisis point now. They must enter the \\"dark,\\" a part of space where there are no planets to explore. After they will pass through it (which will take a whopping 100 generations), they will enter an area of more planets to explore.<br /><br />This story kept me gripped, and the main character and other characters were well-drawn. I was surprised at the level of sophistication in the characterization. Fine points usually found only in literary novels make the characters a rich tapestry. The spaceship environment seems likely and real. Apparently Frank M. Robinson has not written a lot of sci-fi, but I am sure to read the rest of his books.	2005-01-12
US	46754312	R3GXQ51GXDUC0P	0156013282	846440270	Cinnamon Gardens: A Novel	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Exquisite	After reading this author's first book, \\"Funny Boy,\\" I went right to this. Like \\"Funny Boy,\\" it is rich with culture, history and politics, all wrapped up in a fulfilling, captivating story. This book, set in the 1920s, has two parallel narratives.<br /><br />The first is of Annalukshmi, a young, independent woman from Ceylon who struggles with her family's (and society's) insistence on an arranged marriage. The other narrative is about her uncle Balendran, a businessman who has obeyed familial restrictions and expectations, at great emotional sacrifice. Both of their worlds get turned upside down--by the actions of others, and how they choose to react to others in light of their own internal changes.<br /><br />The many other characters are well-drawn, and it's a gripping story you don't want to end. When all the plot lines are tied up, though, it leaves you with a feeling of deep satisfaction and of having seen, and learned from, important lives of an earlier time. Quality writing, superb story-telling and peerless creation of a environment little known to most Westerners.	2005-01-02

It might not be something we like to hear, but it's true.<br /><br />This generous, warm book has all the impact and momentum of \\"A Return to Love.\\" It highlights the ongoing effort we must all make to realize our highest and best self. There are so many turns we take in life that make us feel regret, guilt, sorrow, or pain, but this book has specific ways to learn to push past it. I was especially reminded of what in me is ego-driven and how to convert that so that I can live in my true self.<br /><br />In this book, Marianne Williamson reminds us of a new way to live: we are not separated from God; there's no honor in being \\"small\\"; and any great thing that will happen to us collectively will start with each of us individually.<br /><br />It's not all feel-good psychology, some of it comes from lessons to be learned. The idea of \\"atonement\\" may not be popular with some. But this isn't the atonement of your grandmother's fundamentalist church. It's a surrender that brings empowerment. It helps you take a whole new direction in life on a better path.  Like \\"A Return to Love,\\" I will probably re-read this a few times.	2004-11-11

But a good co-writer would have made a world of difference. Mark Bego is mentioned in one of Mary Wilson's books and has also written about Aretha Franklin. But what did he do on this book? The entire manuscript needed to be tightened. There are places when the story drifts on and on. Also, some terrible errors. For example, on page 176, one paragraph ends with the line, \\"Somehow I felt lost in the shuffle.\\" The end of next paragraph: \\"I felt lost in the shuffle\\"! Did anyone read this before publication?<br /><br />There are phrases in the book like, \\"came back for more, time and time again.\\" Yikes.<br /><br />On the good side, Martha's story is fascinating, and seemingly complete about the earlier years. The parts about her \\"instant\\" job at Motown as a secretary were funny. It shows very well the \\"inside scene\\" of early Motown and how she eventually was with a group and began recording with Motown.<br /><br />The most exciting chapter is chapter 3, the Motown Revue, when in Fall 1962, numerous Motown groups went on the road for the first time in a major tour. Diana Ross' total ambition to herself and nobody but herself is shocking--but does agree with everyone else's accounts of this time.<br /><br />After the excitement of hits, \\"Dancing in the Street\\" (7/64) and \\"Nowhere to Run\\" (2/65), the story is kind of sad. You probably have to be a fan or deeply love Motown to get through the rest of the story. We know it's going to be a decline from there in fame.<br /><br />The incidents with drugs (except for an admission of being dependent on uppers and downers at one time) are in a sort of whoops-I-did-it-again fashion, as if the issue was being skirted. One wants to know more about how prevalent drugs were in her circle, and if this was an ongoing thing to try hard drugs, or just a party thing. This could have lifted the last third of the book to a more interesting read.ing read.	2004-11-04

I was concerned at first that the tape is a \\"book on tape,\\" which it's not. The book has the same theme, the ways we need to heal ourselves of work troubles before we decide to stay in a current job or move on. It's also about finding career direction and one's true nature.<br /><br />One great aspect of the book is that it not only has affirmative thoughts to help you change your thinking to the more positive (in a very real, useful way--not just the usual). It has readings targeting for very specific situations, like, \\"To help you balance work and home,\\" \\"When conflict at work is stressing you,\\" and \\"When money seems tight.\\" The book is filled with these, and each one is tremendously helpful.	2004-11-04

It did come out several years ago. But it's a fascinating look at the early years of the Supremes: how the girls met, their lives in the projects, how they were discovered, and their rise to fame. Most startling is the way Diana Ross acted: grabbing the spotlight, working covertly behind the scenes to advance her own career at the expense of others, and turning a blind eye to the terrible treatment of Florence Ballard by Motown Records. While writer Mary Wilson is, for the most part, even-handed, and the anecdotes she tells ring true, one longs for that autobiography Florence Ballard never wrote. It seemed she should have been the lead singer of the Supremes. Listening to their music (not just the popular hits), one can see that she had a voice superior to Diana Ross's.<br /><br />The most interesting part of the book was the Motown tour in the early 1960s, the fun and innocence of the singers and musicians involved. Many would become very famous later. A sad element is how Motown seemed to really rake in the profits and keep their artists in the dark. Yet Mary Wilson talks glowingly of Berry Gordy.<br /><br />Nice photos and a juicy slice of early 1960s rock music!	2004-11-04

His writing and speaking style remind me of Marianne Williamson. The Four Elements that make up all of work--time, people, tasks and substance--is a very good idea. It really helps you make sense of problems at work and pinpointing what you can solve and what you can't, rather than just hating your job in general. This tape helps if you're looking for career direction, too (much more so than \\"Do What You Love, the Money Will Follow,\\" which isn't always true).

The book attempts to delve deeply into their lives, what went right and what went very, very wrong.<br /><br />As most fans know, the Carpenters had overbearing parents who were attempting to make Richard famous when Karen ended up (reluctantly) in the front. While fans enjoyed their sweet hits, \\"Close to You,\\" \\"We've Only Just Begun\\" and many others, their lives descended into Richard's pill-popping and Karen's tragic anorexia.<br /><br />As one who owns extensive printed materials on the Carpenters, including all their fan club newsletters, it is interesting to see a slight subjective emphasis in this book. Yes, some bios will laud the subjects at hand, while still telling the down side of the story, and this does that to some degree. But oddly, there is too much high stature given to Richard. Though he and Karen were close, it does seem that his control over their career put an extreme amount of pressure on her that helped contribute to her anorexia. Actually, this book has more of an insider picture on her anorexia than anything else ever published. Believe me, it was bad, and you find out just how bad here. I simply wished more information had been developed about when Karen wanted to release her solo album and the family basically talked her out of it. Also, couldn't the author had found more people to talk about the parents' behavior toward Karen and Richard? There's something more there.<br /><br />Other reviewers have suggested this book is somewhat sanitized. While I don't fully agree, I do think there is a tendency to blame everything/everyone else for the decline in the Carpenters' popularity. They were stuck in a groove. Richard wouldn't change his sound and wouldn't let Karen change hers. All groups must change to stay popular. Plus, no record company is going to fully support a band whose leader is sick with they don't know what (they knew little about anorexia then) and looks like a skeleton.<br /><br />It has also been said in other reviews that the book had a terrible writing style. I didn't see that. I thought it was perfectly readable. My only comment is that the book has way too much detail. The editors could have cut 75 pages at least and given it a better pace.<br /><br />That said, it's a pretty decent book. True Carpenters' fans will always take a side or find a fault. But there are no other books on them that are this in-depth, and as time goes on, there probably won't be. Surely Richard won't write his life story, and if so, who cares--it was Karen everyone wanted to know about.y support a band whose leader is sick with they don't know what (they knew little about anorexia then) and looks like a skeleton. <br /> <br />It has also been said in other reviews that the book had a terrible writing style.

It is an amusing romp that attempts to be a deeper story. Relationships are at the core of the plot, and Carson's affair with a married man is probably the best element of suspense.<br /><br />I just wish there had been a little more depth. These characters were a little lightweight, with a seemingly-obligatory mix of races and gay-stereotyped personalities. However, don't let this stop you if you want a fun read, as they say, for the \\"beach or plane.\\" It certainly is escapist and fills the bill that way. But I wouldn't buy a sequel.<br /><br />By the way, the main character Carson's experiences working for a magazine are right out of dreamland. He seems to be able to do anything he wants whenever he wants with however much money he wants. It's all fun, powerful and enriching in this book. Don't be fooled. I've worked on major NY magazines--there are no Helen Gurley Brown's anymore! Magazine editors are idealistic, underpaid and overworked people.	2004-10-20

There are many guys who do serious crunches every day and don't lose their middle.<br /><br />To really get lean abs, you have to know a variety of facts, and Vedral has included all of them in this book without going on in useless detail. It's sort of a little book, which makes it easy to read and later refer to. Absolutely crucial information is here: why a low-fat diet will help, how the number of repetitions vs. the form you use affects your progress, and the many varieties of exercises you need to do. Most people don't know that simply doing basic crunches won't make your stomach lean. That only works one part of your ab muscle structure.<br /><br />There are other ab books out there, but if you don't care to read 250 pages about abs, and need a get-to-the-point guide, here it is.	2004-10-20

I was only a child in that era but of course knew of the stars like Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix who died of drug overdoses. I actually came across this book while looking for another and decided to give it a whirl.<br /><br />This held my interest so well I had trouble getting other things done for a few days while I was reading it. It reads like a good novel. Chuck Negron tells the story of his shockingly bad childhood and years in the music business. While many autobiographies are self-serving and highly slanted, I did not get that impression here. Negron is very even-handed with all of the material, careful not to unduly blame others but also revealing the truth when it's right there.<br /><br />He started in the early 1960s in the music business, but of course, did not have success till the late 1960s. It was interesting to see the many slips and falls of getting to the top. Many rock books skip over that long climb, always making it seem like overnight success. Then the famous years were shocking. Just when I think, \\"Okay, this is the point where he gives up drugs because he's at his lowest,\\" he reaches yet another low. It truly is remarkable, as others have said here, that he lived through it to tell this story.<br /><br />He does mention the many battles with other former band members Cory and Danny over the right to use the band's name, etc. It's ironic, but it seems they used him. Almost everyone recognizes Chuck Negron as the lead singer of Three Dog Night and wouldn't even know Cory and Danny if they saw their photos. In fact, many people think Negron sang the lead on all the songs. I did until I read this book!<br /><br />Sharing rusty needles, staggering around doped-up and filthy, driving his car into light poles--it's all so juicy that if someone wrote this stuff as a fiction book, it would be said that the story \\"went overboard\\" or that it's \\"too much.\\" Negron almost ruined the lives of his ex-wives and children, spent millions upon millions of dollars over the years in heroin, and to see his recovery his both astonishing and heroic.<br /><br />I recommended this book to a friend who never cared about Three Dog Night but who wanted something captivating to read, and he liked it.children, spent millions upon millions of dollars over the years in heroin, and to see his recovery his both astonishing and heroic. <br /> <br />I recommended this book to a friend who never cared about Three Dog Night but who wanted something captivating to read, and he liked it.	2004-10-20

Books	5	4	4	N	N	One of the best exercise books ever, and I should know	As an editor and writer for major men's fitness magazines, I have seen it all in exercise books. I don't write many reviews here on Amazon.com of these books. There are just too many that are the same.<br /><br />This one is truly different. A concise guide that is well-designed, it lists a series of tips under various categories, such as cardio exercise, back pain, home fitness equipment, fat, fitness after 50, etc. I still refer to it from time to time.<br /><br />It is a no-nonsense, no-fluff guide with no particular angle to push. Just good, real-world information from a pro who knows what he's talking about. I don't like books with lots of photos on how to do the exercise, because I've been to the gym for years and know how to do them all. But if I want to remember how many calories are burned per hour playing racquetball, or specifically how to distinguish muscle pain from soreness, it's here. The book is good to read through when you get it, then keep handy as a reference book when you need it.<br /><br />This is a timeless book for both men and women, at any level of exercise experience.	2004-10-20
US	46754312	R9O3C8WJLKLBM	1575666618	254951238	The World Of Normal Boys	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Amazing, in-depth and readable	This story rings so true that it must be the real growing-up tale of the author, K.M. Soehnlein, or at least parts are true. It's the story of a 14-year-old boy growing up in the suburbs of New Jersey in what seems like a very normal family. Robin just wants to fit in.<br /><br />Soon he finds a new world when he experiments sexually with one male friend, then a neighbor guy. New feelings emerge just when other things are coming out about his family--his mother's heavy wine drinking, his brother's seemingly favored status. He grows up fast. He finds out his friend is being abused.  Then his brother is in a frightening accident that tilts the whole story in yet another direction.<br /><br />I appreciated the gradual change of Robin from a meek, sissified 14-year-old to a boy with raging hormones and rages as well. As he begins to understand what he is, he gets the courage and drive to take on all that challenges him. The story isn't bleak, but it's not easy. It's got action, but much thoughtfulness. It's certainly not predictable. A captivating, highly-readable book.	2004-10-20

Firoozeh Dumas takes us on a funny, captivating adventure in this true story of her family's \\"temporary\\" stay in southern California in the early 1970s. The family's raucous time--her father competing in \\"Bowling for Dollars,\\" numerous trips to Disneyland, and even daily school life--truly makes a laugh-out-loud funny story. I seldom laugh out loud at a book, but this one does have that magic.<br /><br />This is very insightful about the experience of an Iranian-American who dealt with prejudice mostly in a humorous way. There is a sort of pause about midway through the book, when there are a couple of chapters that get slightly more serious--but never heavy. The latter part of the book deals more with her adult life, which also has its funny times. The chronology might be hazy: the family returns to Iran for awhile, and is back in the U.S. (and, unfortunately, suffers) during the Iranian hostage crisis. But not being able to track all the specifics doesn't detract from the book. I didn't want something heavy, just a new perspective on life in America, and got this revealing, surprising gem of a story.	2004-09-22

This is a collection of engaging first-person nonfiction stories by Asian-American writers. Anyone of western culture would be fascinated by these stories. I turned to Amy Tan's first, since she is a famous writer. But all of the stories are good (you can skip the introduction). They cover experiences of Americans whose ancestry is Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and more. A painful, though subtle, element to the book is understanding how a \\"caucasianing\\" process has happened to most of these people.<br /><br />They are personal stories. If you like family drama, laugh-out-loud humor, and a good tearjerker, it is found in here. If you have thought of \\"Asian-Americans\\" as a single group of people, you will not after reading this.	2004-09-16

Her book is about the Afghan-American experience. Ironically, I picked up this book looking for experiences of Pakistani-Americans for a research project. I could not find one, but decided to start with this book.<br /><br />The author relates her experiences growing up in the U.S., visiting Afghanistan, and trying to hold Afghan traditions in a western culture. Being part of both is not an easy thing to do. This even-handed, well-written book clearly explains historical, cultural and present-day aspects of Afghanistan life and of being Afghan-American. I normally read fiction, and skim some nonfiction, but did not with this book. I was pleasantly surprised at her engaging, colorful writing.<br /><br />I half-expected some propaganda. However, I can honestly say the book seems highly objective. Maryam understands both the U.S. and Afghan side of the issues with an intelligent balance. While I had known some about the Islam faith, I learned a lot more. I also have a much better understanding of the role of women in Middle Eastern culture, the difference between Middle Eastern culture and Muslim beliefs, and the true relationship of the Taliban to the Afghan people.	2004-09-16

The story is extremely well constructed and the voice of the narrator is sheer perfection. I think this is better than Edmund White and even on a level of the breathtaking writing of Charles Frazier (\\"Cold Mountain\\"). The voice, the narrator of the novel, comes through crystal-clear.<br />Case in point: the main character does not describe his looks until page 78. He doesn't reveal he's gay until several dozen pages in the book. The characters unfold so organically to the story that it all meshes beautifully. It's engrossing, involving, and poignant. Bart Yates is the type of writer whom I will follow--I will watch for his name and look for his books for years to come. His talent shines through and makes a premium novel.	2004-01-14

Rylant is obviously great, but why couldn't she cut it here? Laura's character is clearly changed, obviously having a \\"modern\\" sensibility not in the other books. For instance, in this book the character of Laura refers to her family as \\"pioneers\\"--something not done in the original books. The character of Ma is very different in tone, too. Rylant just slapped on the characteristics--such as Pa calling Laura \\"flutterbudget.\\" Rylant must have chosen to write this book for the money, because it clearly is the worst thing she's ever written.<br />The original series had a particular, exact style. Putting this book in between \\"Plum Creek\\" and \\"Silver Lake\\" doesn't \\"fill in\\" anything--the books were originally written to bridge the gap. Now, with the \\"Martha\\" and \\"Charlotte\\" books and the new series about everyone who ever approached the Little House, the magic of the original books is getting diluted. In the future no one will probably know which are the \\"real\\" books by Laura and which are the books about Ma as a girl, grandma as a girl, Rose as a girl, etc. etc. . How sad.<br />The publisher, HarperCollins, is killing the goose that laid the golden egg.	2002-10-12
