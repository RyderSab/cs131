The reviewer was right, and this book is no exception, but the situations that cause  this damage are where this book stands apart.<br />Angela, our heroine, has  diabetes and it is in control of her life.  There is no way around it and  that knowledge has made her a vulnerable, walled-in woman.  She is not  given to trusting people and believes she has no right ask someone to share  her life.  Rafe, our hero, is in the middle of a life crisis.  He has a  brand-new baby and a lifestyle that does not support families. <br />The two  wind up together in Conard County and their acquaintanceship grows into  understanding, followed by friendship, trust and love.  This is a  delicately rendered story, a lot of emotions are juggled between the couple  and they have a lot to learn about themselves before they're ready to trust  themselves to each other.  The dance is fascinating to  follow.<br />Involuntary Daddy is a departure from the usual romance fare, but  not so much that the reader is left unsatisfied.  I recommend this book to  those that are looking for something a little different but don't want to  sacrifice quality for a new plot.	2000-06-08
US	52044557	R2F5IO5QCZ39CF	0380800381	340058187	Sleepless in Montana	Books	2	4	6	N	Y	I really did not enjoy this book.	Ms. London told the story of 4 romances in these 375 pages.  She chose one of the weaker and more annoying ones as her main focus.  This was the story of Jemma and Hogan, two misfits in their own families.  They spend their  lives in a snit at each other, deliberately rubbing each other the wrong  way until the book starts and it's time for them to fall in love.<br />In my  opinion the real story, the one with the most emotional impact, was Carley  and Mitch's story.  But it was underplayed for a manic heroine and a  repressed hero.  Now, when the lovescenes came, they were hot... but one  shouldn't have to suffer through stilted dialogue, extraordinarily badly  crafted scene changes and thinly drawn characters to read a few pages of  good sex.  <br />The first 150 pages of the book were crammed with too much  information.  We got to know the likes and habits of eight main characters,  some of them not very likeable.  There were three secondary characters in  the entire book, they were all evil (presumably anyone who wasn't a main  character was evil).  <br />I've read other Cait London books and they were  all right.  Unless she changes her style, I won't be reading many more.	2000-05-30

The main suspect is our heroine, Alicia.  As any reader of romance knows, the heroine is never guilty of cold-blooded murder.  And there ends the  dramatic tension.  The reader knows she didn't do it, all that's left is  for the author to prove how.  It's anti-climactic.  The actual murderer is  someone the reader can figure out from page 2.  It was so obvious that I  was betting against myself for it not to be the person I anticipated and I  actually groaned aloud when it was revealed.  I'm not going to discuss just  how many plot holes and inconsistencies their were throughout the novel,  but it's more than I can count on one hand.<br />Then there's our heroine, the  consummate lady.  She spends the majority of the book either crying or  being sarcastic.  Sometimes both at the same time.  Our hero, Lafferty (aka  Mike) has to overcome his ethics in order to help Alicia.  I'm still not  convinced it was a necessary step, but I guess it advanced the plot.<br />Full  points to Ms. Malek for continuing the story after the murder was wrapped  up.  And points for the children being more realistic than most we see in  romances.  Alicia and Mike's story didn't work for me, I just couldn't  relate.  Maybe someone in circumstances similar to the hero or heroine's  would have more appreciation for this book.	2000-05-25

Our heroine, Erin gets a phone call one night from a man she thinks is her brother.  Our hero has a cold and they are joking just like old times before they realize who is really on  the other end.  <br />When they make the discovery they decide to run with it  a bit.  There is safety in both strangers and distance and these two need a  bit of string-free affection in their lives.  Of course, romance being what  it is... things stay neither simple, nor distant for long and it's  interesting to see how these two deal with their insecurities.  They are  both defensive, but a willingness to work on their problems isn't enough to  solve them.  They had to grow, change and trust again and it's the work  they put into this process that makes this book a keeper.	2000-05-21

That's my first and major problem with this book.  Another issue was that Ms. Palmer spent the first 3 chapters explaining the characters and their circumstances over and over.   The next was that our hero, Tate, went through much of the book as an  angry man.  That gets very old.  Further, for characters who place so much  value on honesty, they certainly spent enough time lying.<br />This book is  standard Palmer fare.  The heroine is virginal and scared of sex, the hero  is forceful and dark-complexioned.  There were some plot holes and odd  decisions that further weakened this book, yet, I can't pan it entirely  because it was an all right read.  The hero even explains his decision to  make racist decisions, but it was too little and too late for me to believe  it.<br />There are some old Palmer books where her formula works very well.   This isn't one of them.  I won't be reading the next one in the series.	2000-05-21

This one featured the town doctor, Kane and a his long lost love, Moriah with whom he had a brief affair in their late teens.  They have both been feeling the pangs of  betrayal ever since.  <br />The plot is quite similar to Ms. Paige's previous  contribution to the series, but much better executed.  Kane is a man who is  ready to settle down, ready to move into a settled stage of life.  Moraih  is in denial, she has built a life for herself and wants it to be full -  but instead it's lacking satisfaction.  When her father disappears, she is  thrown back into contact with the father of her child and now has to decide  whether to accept the consequences of her past or keep on running.   <br />There was a bit more hand-wringing, self-pity and evasion of truth than  I like in a book, but the story moved well enough to make it bearable, and  the motivations behind their actions was understandable.  More than that, I  liked Kane.  He was a good man torn between his beliefs and his desires.   Moriah wasn't as likeable - but she was still a sympathetic character.   Melanie, their daughter, came from the casting couch of Children Too  Adorable To Be Real.  Somehow though, her effect was balanced by her  mother's generally irascible attitude.     I'm not sure how well Father  Found would stand up on its own, but as a part of this series, it's among  the better of the selections.	2000-05-13

Blaic and Felicia were nice together - they had a lot of chemistry, but spent too little time together for me to enjoy their  romance.<br />Kissed By Starlight felt like it was Felicia's story. We were  supposed to learn and understand all about this woman who was born on the  wrong side of the proverbial tracks and has grown up to be pure, strong and  honourable anyway. Along the way she happens to meet a faery prince and  fall in love with him, but that's not the meat of the story. The meat of  the story is Felicia's relationship with all of those around her, including  but not limited to: the doctor, the constable, her stepmother, her sister,  the orphanage children, her maid and other town and country inhabitants.  <br />The Faery world was interesting, Blaic wasn't the best hero I've ever  read, but he was a good mate for Felicia. I was also confused by the  relationship between Blaic and the people who were responsible for his  punishment. Undoubtedly this  was all explained in the previous book or  books in the series, but a few words of explanation or a Prologue wouldn't  have gone amiss. More disturbing than that, there were more than a few  instances of sloppy writing where the scene or time was changed without  acknowlegement by the author, leaving me scrambling to figure out when the  transition happened. <br />Through all this Ms. Bailey told an interesting  story. Had I known what I was getting into, I probably wouldn't have  purchased this book, but, once it was in my hands I didn't have a bad time  reading it.	2000-05-13

Sarah had to work against her fear and instincts, but  she knew that Connor was the best thing for her.  The plot device used to  build a good part of this story is overdone in recent romance literature,  but Ms. Sterling made it intriguing all over again.  <br />I was struck by the  incredible intimacy of the first love scene.  It was so well written that I  was reminded once again of why sex and sharing is a vulnerable experience  and why it must be treated with such care by both parties.  It's not often  a book can pull off that message without preaching or falling into  melodrama.    I'll definitely buy Ms. Sterling's next book right off the  shelf.	2000-05-06

Just wonderful.   <br />Miss Emmaline and the Archangel started off with a bang.  5 stars all the way.  Ms. Lee created two deeply  sympathic characters in Gage and Emmaline.  A couple who, on the outside,  don't seem to belong together, but their hearts understood each other's  pain long before they recognized it for themselves.  I couldn't put this  story down, I wanted to know if Ms. Lee would settle for the same old  ending and the same old resolution.  She didn't.  I was entranced.<br />The  second story, Ironheart, took longer to get into.  It was a four and a half  star story because  the development of the relationship between beautiful  Mouse and fantastic Gideon took a while before I felt a real connection.   Once there though, Gideon proved himself to be a true ero; not by solving  Sara's problems or killing the bad guy, but by understanding her and  bettering himself for her.  The dramatic tension in this one wasn't as  high, but the intimacy Ms. Lee used to build the emotional tension was  compelling. Ironheart was a very satisfying read.	2000-04-21
US	52044557	R2DZTZGUZMNCUU	0449148610	123261484	Heaven Knows	Books	3	16	17	N	Y	Not my style	I have a feeling other people will enjoy this book more than I, which is why I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 2.  I read ANGEL IN MARBLE and was really impressed by it, couldn't wait to read Tavis' story.  I should have  just been satisfied with what I got and not asked for more.<br />I never  cared for these characters.  Lizzie was madly in love with Tavis, for no  good reason other than a childhood fantasy. He spends a good deal of the  book disliking her. We never see a side of Tavis that makes him worthy of  this devotion.  He's pig-headed, none too kind, lacking in compassion and  generally undeserving of her obsession.  The most well-rounded character in  the novel was Lizzie's grandfather.<br />Another thing I did not appreciate  about this book was the vast amounts of time the h &amp; h spent apart.  In  my opinion, a romance should be centered around the development of the  relationship between the hero and heroine, not all the things they're  thinking of each other or doing while they're apart.  It detracts from  romantic and sexual tension.  There was also a very heavy reliance by Ms.  Coffman on quotes, homilies and bits of wisdom.  So much so that it became  a distraction, some of them didn't even feel appropriate to the scene.<br />I can't recommend his book because I did not enjoy it, but I have a  feeling this style of writing might appeal to the reader who likes sweet  books that are light on motivation or appreciable conflict.  I will choose  to believe that Ms. Coffman just ran out of steam on this 5th book of the  series and give her another shot.	2000-04-16

I did not want to put this book down and it's earned a  prime spot on my keeper shelf.  Rorie, our (well padded) heroine, is smart,  stubborn and determined to have her own way - even when she she doesn't  quite understand all that's going on around her.  Gabriel is equally  intelligent and determined but he knows exactly what he's facing.  He also  knows it's not good.  <br />When I first started this book I was worried it  was going to fall right into a typical slot.  But within 40 pages I was  entranced.  These two lit sparks off each other and balanced it with a  tenderness that kept me wanting more.   Brava, Ms Barton.  This is one  great book.	2000-04-12

Everyone was wonderful, the heroine was a paragon of virtue, confidence and caring.  The hero was true to his ideals, his parents and the memory of his dead wife.  <br />All of the secondary characters were fine, upstanding,  independent people, and there's not a darn thing wrong with that.  The one  exception is the heroine's mother, but that's ok, because her mother helped  shape who she is now, and now she's wonderful.   I felt like I was reading  a fairy-tale written for  a blue-haired ladies reading circle... not  there's anything wrong with that.  The emphasis was on living for today.   The secondary storyline revolved around the vicissitudes of life that can  take a strong marriage and make it shake.  I'm sure some people will  totally love this story, but I like my romance a bit more realistic, and a  bit more focussed on the main couple.	2000-04-08

Eventually BLAZE setled down into a good read with a  sensible plot, villainous villain, heroic hero and a really enjoyable  romance.   Ms. Johnson has the ability to write sizzling sex, but oddly the  most passionate scenes in this book happened when the h &amp; h were angry  with each other or when there was very little emotional commitment.  <br />If  I was recommending this book to a friend I'd say skim the first 75 pages  until Blaze agrees to negotiate with Hazard and then settle in for the  read.  It's worth it.	2000-04-02

Good sexy hero, interesting strong heroine and a background that had potential.  <br />Unfortunately though, there was nothing too special about this book.  Despite the potential for all kinds  of interesting developments, Ms. Barton didn't take advantage of them.   Caleb had a debilitating injury and a lot of guilt to work through.  Sheila  had a secret and a mother's protective instincts.  And they had a history.   An eleven year old history.<br />As a result, this became a romance between 3  people.  The sexual tension and emotional turmoil that can really be  explosive when stretched between a couple was diluted to include the needs  and desires of the child.  <br />After this series I think I'll stick to Ms.  Barton's longer titles where she has room to really show her talents.	2000-04-02

When we get to the real story, both the h &amp; h  lack the courage to go after what they really want - each other.  Instead  of being honest and talking with each other, they allowed themselves to be  dictated by other people's opinions of how they should live their lives.

They have to make a  conscious decision that they're going to live beyond their pasts and find  the courage to be together.  That's what I liked about this book, both the  hero and the heroine had to work at the relationship.  It didn't just work  itself out because they fell in lust.  It's not the best book ever - the  dialogue with the secondary characters felt stilted and unrealistic, the  plot was too convenient.  But I liked and could understand the main couple.

It didn't work.  The  sex scenes were rather hot - quite nice in fact, but not enough emotion in  them to convince me that these two should be in love by the end of it.      Mr Forster gets a star for realism, not having a virginal heroine, and  incorporating child who isn't a vision of sweetness and light.

My second biggest issue was the author's tongue-in-cheek allusions to romance writers' attributes.<br />If you're going to make an argument that romance  writers are real people too, why make the hero tall, dark, dimpled,  handsome and strapping and the make the heroine slight, elegant, with a  body that won't quit and long blonde hair?  <br />The characters made some  stupid and annoying decisions that were based on game-playing and  one-upsmanship.  The one thing I really can't get over though is that the  hero bought the heroine's daughter a dog, without any prior warning and  without permission (obviously).  You don't do that to someone, you don't do  that to an animal and you do not do that to a single mother.     Ms.  Thompson had many false starts that she didn't develop as well as she could  have.  It's a pity because those resolutions could have really worked to  bring the couple together, but they kind of faded away.  Otherwise, it was  a mostly pleasant read.  I did have one laugh-out-loud moment.  And when  they finally 'did the deed' I was impressed with our hero's sensitivity.  I  like what Ms. Thompson did with the relationship between the mother and the  daughter - that development was one of the more interesting rel.s I've read  in a while.  Good Cover.

This one was nice, but I was looking forward to reaching the end.  The plot was predictable, but then they give it away on the back blurb anyway.  That which wasn't given away  was fairly easy to figure out (given there's one evil guy, one bad guy and  it's a romance) but I was all right with that.  Don't go into this book  expecting surprises.<br />The writing style was difficult to get into.  1st  person for the heroine, 3rd person for everyone else.  It was jarring.   Cool ending though.  It almost alleviated the depressing tone that weighed  over the rest of the book.	2000-03-21

There's this bridesmaid, and a guy (who becomes her bodyguard) sees her across a room, talks to her and is in love.  Why? He's so in love that he'll aggravate his family, lie to them, suspect them and use them.  But  why? She's cool and uninterested in him, and it seems an over-reaction when  we finally (far too late) find out why. He's given her a nickname.  What  has she done to deserve it?  There are too many emotions built on a hint,  without susbstance backing it up. Despite all of this, I got through the  book.  I just really had to be willing to suspend my disbelief and accept  that these characters have something special for each other.  Ms. Hingle  gets the 3 stars for building suspense, (though I knew who the bad guy was  as soon as he was introduced), creating a hero who knows how to care for  his woman, and for nice love scenes.	2000-02-04

I'm generally not a fan of anthologies, I feel they usually sell the stories short and only gloss over the character and plot depth for want of space.  I'm pleased to say this book didn't feel like that at all.   4  story submissions and only one didn't grab me by the heart.  They were all  sweet, and hot.  The heros were adorable and the situations ... well, I  wouldn't go so far as to say they were realistic, but I happily suspended  my disbelief for 80 pages.    I'd definitely recommend this for light,  happy reading.	2000-01-22

And I had to finish this book, it was like watching a train wreck - you know what's going to happen, exactly what's going to happen, and still, you can't look away.   Shall we start with  Melissa?  The heroine who is so hurt, and angry after six years that she  won't calm down long enough to simply ask 'why?' of the man she supposedly  loved?  I really felt sympathy for her at the beginning of the book - by  the middle I just wanted to lock her in a closet.  By the end, I was almost  tempted to smack her around some.   Then, there's the Wyatt who has serious  problems comprehending the word, &quot;no&quot;.  He had sounded like a  great guy - and Wyatt had his moments of studliness too, but they were not  impressive enough to outweigh his rape.   The plot?  If you've read romance  books for more than a year, you've read this plot at least 10 times  already.   And finally, the villain.  One dimensional.   If you can find a  copy of this book anywhere, pass it by and pick up the next one on the  shelf.	2000-01-20

This book was awesome.  I enjoyed it quite a bit more than the first one, Private Pleasures.<br />This was a fully character driven romance with a hero and heroine who had both  suffered their fair share of angst and came through the other end more  vulnerable, scarred and unwilling to trust.   The hero was fantastic, we  should all be so lucky to get a man like him.  The heroine had issues that  were easy to relate to, yet you could understand just how debilitating they  were.     I savoured this book.  Can't wait to pick up the next one.	2000-01-10

I finished it months ago and still haven't put it away because I always want to pick it up and read it again.  <br />Ms. Phillips created  wonderfully distinct engaging characters who are easy to identify with.   Mac and Samantha created a bond with their hearts, bodies and souls.  Even  when things were at their lowest, deep down, they didn't lose faith in one  another and that was the most special part.  I can't wait to read the other  book written under her pseudonym.	2000-01-08

It felt formula. One woman, add man and baby at approximately the same time - stir. Instant Love.<br />I'm not saying that the characters didn't  have some endearing quirks, or face any obstacles on the road to Happily  Ever After.  It's just that these things didn't feel like enough to bring  the story to life.	2000-01-07

I wavered on whether to give this book a 3 or a 4, but by the end of the read, I was satisfied, so I upped it a star.   The writing felt very disjointed for the first 100 pages or so, I didn't understand why the  characters were acting as they were; I was frustrated by Marc's  unwillingness to be honest with Melanie.  I felt like I was missing the  backstory tht made these two decide they wanted to start a romance in the  first place.   But, by the second half I felt like the book had settled  into the saddle and I was in for a good ride (read).  The second half  wasn't good enough to forgive the first half, but the motivations became  more clear and the characters felt more realistic.   I'll try the next book  in the series, but I'm not dedicated to Ms. Carrington's work just yet.	2000-01-05

Nick does something so out of character I'm still wondering if Elaine Coffman wrote it, or if some editor didn't feel the need to punch it up herself.    <br />Aside from that  though I give this book the highest marks.  A fully character driven  historical that pulled me in from the first page and kept me in its tight  grip til the end.  I generally don't enjoy historicals because the authors  seem so insistent on making sure that you _know_ he/she has done the  research by describing so much inconsequential scenery, that if you cut it  out you'd save 100 pages.  I'm pleased to say Ms. Coffman doesn't do this.   Just as a modern author wouldn't take 4 paragraphs to describe a television  set, Ms. Coffman treats the world of Nick and Tibbie as if it deserves no  special attention except for the fact that they are in it.              Angel In Marble was a wonderful read - Ms. Coffman took what could have  been hackneyed elements and breathed fresh life into an entirely  captivating story.  I really cared about the characters - even the  secondary ones seemed to light up the page.  I was only 50 pages into the  book when I knew wanted to read the sequel.  I've already ordered it.   I  highly recommend this one.	2000-01-03

But the tenderness and fireworks that marked the pair in the beginning of the book, the sparks that made the couple so special seemed to fade as the necessity to wrap up the mystery moved to the forefront. Our hero and  heroine were simply on a collision course of love, and I never believed  that anything would keep them from it. Once the mystery was inevitably  resolved, all that was left was for them to fall into each others arms.  <br />&quot;If A Man Answers&quot; was obviously well researched, and I give  Ms. Lovelace full points for setting the scene. There were some good  moments, no doubt about it - but ultimately this book isn't going to be a  keeper.	2000-01-03
US	52044557	R22TN95Z31OOZJ	0373440561	243168128	Monday Man	Books	3	5	6	N	Y	I liked it.	Based on the Amazon system, 5 stars for &quot;Love&quot;, 4 stars for &quot;Great&quot; and 3 for &quot;Like&quot;, I liked this book.   <br />It  was just a bit too fluffy for me.  Our hero and heroine had a great set-up,  a good chance to get to know each other and it felt wasted in the need to  wrap up the mystery.  The time that Nick and Lucy spent together was mostly  concentrated on the dilemma that originally brought them together, not on  getting to know each other.  Thus, by the time I reached the end of the  book, Nick and Lucy were together forever and I was left wondering why.   They never had &quot;The Sex&quot;, they barely had the intimate talks.   The bachelor auction that is emblazed on the cover seems like it was  slipped in there as a hook, not as a necessary part of the story.   <br />But,  there are good things about this book.  I enjoyed Ms. Gabriel's  characterization.  Love the fact that our hero has something interesting in  his past, and Ms. Gabriel handled it well.  I enjoyed the humor throughout  the book, some situational, some laced in the secondary characters.    <br />This book won't make my keeper pile, but I'll give it away so others can  enjoy it.	2000-01-02

Aside from that, it was a rip-roaring read.  I literally could not put it down - I was reading while I got dressed in the morning.  <br />My problems with this book were that it took so very long to get started, in fact I was  100pp in before I felt the hero and heroine made any real connection.  (It  was at least 45 pages before they even met) Once they did though, things  didn't slow down until I turned the last page.  <br />Ms. Wilson created very  real characters in the midst of out-of-this-world drama.  She got into the  head of a single mother with all of her contradictions and worries  admirably.  The kids were great (and I don't even really like kids in  romances).  Our hero was wonderful in how he related to women.  <br />I just  wish the book hadn't taken so long to get into the meat of the story.	1999-12-29

Not to detract from the talent of the authors, but the format of the 2 books crammed into the 215 +/- pages didn't suit me.  I'm used to a more  involved story and these two were so compact that they didn't quite do it  for me.  They didn't have much in the way of secondary characters to flush  out the quirks, foibles and tolerances of the main characters. Also, they  seemed rushed - like the authors didn't  have room to add in a moment when  all seems lost and the two (four) main characters have to decide to change  themselves in the name of love.<br />I would have preferred to see the stories  as full length, because they were good stories.  But the format  shortchanged the works and left me wanting.	1999-12-22

Ms. Wilson made sure there were no holes in her plot, I appreciate that respect for the reader.  The hero and heroine came just shy of touching my heart though.

In true romantic form we have a feisty virginal heroine and a war-damaged hero.  It lost a star for unoriginality and a bit of uncalled for grabbing, but I got a kick out of it anyway.

There was this whole great set-up in the things a woman has to go through according to how she looks... but she never really followed through with how a woman's perpective changes  according to how the world treats her when she's 'ugly' as opposed to  'model looking'.   The mystery was ok.  Kept me guessing well enough - but  when I closed the book I didn't feel as if our hero and heroine knew each  other well enough to fall in love.	1999-12-14

Of course,when you do that, you lose  your books.  It took me 10 years to get another copy, but I never forgot  the characters - the surprising sassiness of our heroine in the face of  arrogance and blind stubbornness from our hero.  The surprising tenderness  of our hero when confronted with our slightly befuddled and alarmingly  old-fashioned heroine.

I loved this book.  <br />Unlike most of the other readers, I didn't expect  the same book as Like Water For Chocolate (which I liked, but not as much  as this book).  I paid for a new story and that's what I got.  <br />The plot  was great.  Just great.  It takes a lot of skill to work with what are  supposed to be just 4 or five main characters but put them in a revolving  wheel of time and gender and bodies.  Every new twist had me stretching my  mind a little bit more to follow Esquivel.<br />I laughed out loud at some of  the poems - and at the characterization of some of the less than heroic  characters.<br />Admittedly, the first chapter or so was jarring and brutal.   But it was so, SO worth sticking with the story.<br />If you want a carbon  copy of Like Water For Chocolate - read it again.  If you want a new,  interesting, innovative, funny, inspiring book - read The Law of Love.  I'm  still singing its praises over a year later.	1998-10-15

And I wanted more  character from the main character.  It was a good read, but hardly a  masterful novel. It's been a year since I read the book, the details have  faded.  However I remember enjoying the picture he painted of a country  most people in the world don't know about.  I know it was a novel though,  so I didn't expect fact.   By the end I was drawn into his mystery,  cheering for his character and hoping that everything would turn out right  in the end.  I still contend that the secondary characters needed to be  more robust, and the mystery needed to be less subtle.	1998-08-26
