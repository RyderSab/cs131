The book is not an incomplete novel, although there are some pieces of novels within it.  Rather, the majority of the book is a collection of articles, speeches and other musings from Adams.  While these are interesting they are not consistent with the &quot;advertising&quot;<br />If you are a big Douglas Adams fan and are really interested in his ideas, thoughts and views, then buy the book and you will enjoy it.  If you are a casual fan, or a fan of the HHGTG or Dirk Gently, then skip this work or wait for it on paperback.<br />As you probably know, Douglas Adams died suddenly and certainly too early for someone of his character.  This book is more of a memorial than an unfinished novel that will only appeal to people who are deeply interested in getting to know him better.	2002-07-17

The concepts in the book can fundamentally change the way you communicate and think through issues and present ideas.  This book and its concepts literaly turns everything you know about writing upside down.<br />Interestingly enough, the book is not particularly well written and can be difficult to grasp. <br />I strongly advise that, if possible, you find someone who practices Minto as a mentor to help you apply the content and concepts in the book.  You will learn it better when you have someone tear down your work (using minto principles) in order to build a stronger communication.<br />Here are some of the key ideas in the book to help you structure your thinking and communications.<br />1)What is the situation ?  A statement that the audience agrees exists and will immediately recognize.<br />2) What is the complication?  The event or condition that renders the situation no longer tenable or in other words &quot;why the status quo will no longer stand&quot;<br />3) The R1 describes what we have now.  This helps set the scope of the arguement<br />4) The R2 descibes the world as it should be.  This sets the scope of the solution.<br />Good luck with the ideas in the book.	2002-01-07

Unfortunately few people who invoke Talyor's name have ever read his origional work on sought to understand his ideas.  Most authors latch on to the essense of his ideas -- to look at the work, organize it as best as possible, measure it and improve it.<br />While these are important aspects of modern management, most people fail to understand the issues Taylor is trying to address. He must be read in the context of his times -- the late 19th and early 20th century when work was moving out of being a craft and into scientific-mass produced factory labor.  When you consider the context-Taylors work is really about removing &quot;slack&quot; from work practices and standardization more than anything else.<br />Given that people are now talking about &quot;knowlege work and empowerment&quot; references to Taylor fall somewhat flat.  The economy is moving back from factory to craft work based on knowledge. <br />The pamphlet is a good read for someone who wants to understand the intellecutal underpinnings of a process/workflow approach to management.  In that regard it is higly recommended even it it takes some time to get through and you have to remember that this is a man of the 1870's and 1900's else you will get hung up on his ethinically insensitive comments -- particularly if you are Irish and other ideas.	2002-01-02

The book is loosely written and not as tight as Card's other works.  You can skip the first 200 pages which is repetitive, predictable and simply not up to his standards.  The remainder of the book is fine but it comes to a rapid conclusion with a number of sweeping paragraphs that wrap everything up with little imagination.  The book reads more like a play-by-play account of the game RISK, something that the author points out in his epiloge -- it should have been the prologe. <br />The characters are particularly flat and one dimensional -- a real disappointment given the earlier Ender books.  Achillies is bent on taking over the world and killing Bean, Bean is bend on killing Achillies and the other characters fall on either side of this fence. Peter Wiggen while present in the book is really dealt with in a superficial way with a minor role.<br />I know that Card returned to the Ender series after a long hiatus and Ender's Shadow is as good as Ender's Game. Unfourtunately this work reads like it was written as part of a multi-book publishing contract -- something he had to do but didn't have enough material for it. <br />It could have been a terrific Novella or short story but it goes thin very fast when streatched into a novel.<br />Overall a poor showing.  I almost bought this book in hardcover after reading Enders's Shadow -- a very good book and highly recommended.  But I am glad I only invested a few dollars in the paperback edition.	2002-01-02

In this regard, it is the first major business book for the post internet boom era as it goes back to what is the core of successful companies. <br />Collins book is not revolutionary and I can boil the whole book down to one idea. PEOPLE PEOPLE PEOPLE.  Good leaders who hire good people and have the discipline to stick to the core of their business.  All of Collins conclusions draw back to this simple truth -- you have a chance when you have the right people.<br />In some ways PEOPLE are so simple, but so difficult to achieve. Collins other points are also straightforward such as having a Level 5 Leader (the humble brilliant leader who places the company ahead of himself), Being a Hedgehog (dogged focus on the simple core issue), the Stockdale principle (having an unswaying belief that you will reach your destination -- even if you don't know how you will get there) and finally having the discipline to make this happen throughout the organization.<br />Read the book if you are looking to refresh your thinking about business.  <br />On the down side, the book does repeat itself and certain catch phrases which adds a touch of tedium to the work.  This undermines some of the power of the advice.<br />On the plus side, the writing is very strong and highly readable making you feel as if you are part of Collins' research team.  Overall, this is a work is worth the time and investment in thinking through what it means to your company.  Particularly if you are looking to come out of the Internet hype.	2001-11-21

This approach is behind works such as &quot;Pursuit of Excellence&quot; and &quot;Built to Last&quot;.  Unfortunately for Wiersema he conducted his research at the peak of the economic boom of the 1990's.  This makes many of Wiesema's conclusions ring hollow in the face of weak customer demand, increasing competition and an uncertain future.<br />Wiersema's earlier book on Value Disciplines contributed early on to a move to core competency.  This book represents an interesting academic exercise as to what was market leading in the 90's and less so on how to address current market realities and challenges.	2001-11-21

The book's central premise is on the need and how-to necessary to continuously evolve a company's capabilities.  <br />The book breaks itself down into two parts and nine chapters that provide a pragmatic approach to understanding what is required and then how to make it happen. <br />The Blueprint section of the book discusses the requirements and strategies for an innovative organization.  It faces up to the hard issues of business processes, strategies, customers and technology.  It also covers one of the most overlooked aspects of innovation &quot;measurement.&quot;  Yes, you need measurement in order to innovation continuously and successfully.<br />The next section &quot;Making it happen&quot; talks about how a company targets its efforts -- gaining focus and an ability to act.  It also discusses business simulation -- a technique that helps manage the risk and uncertainty when innovating.<br />The best part of these sections is the commentary and examples that ripple throughout the book.  These are not the overused stories of 3M, GE and others, rather they include a number of companies you may not have heard of but who are winning the innovation-competition race.  It is a welcome experience to hear from new companies as well as a significant number of European companies to give you fresh perspective and insight.<br />Steve Shapiro, the author, is an experienced consultant, which shows to some degree in the book, and people who want to bash consultants will be unable to get past this point to their loss.  However, for the business leader who is looking to gain real insight and pick up some new techniques 24/7 Innovation is one of the few books that is worth the read.<br />If you have read some of my other reviews, (click on the link above) you will find that I am critical with business books.  My time is limited, as is yours, and this book is one that warrants the investment in reading and taking the time to understand its premise and information.  You will walk away with some new ideas.<br />Other books to consider in this area include Michael Schrage's &quot;Serious Play&quot; a book on simulation and Dietrich Dorner's &quot;The Logic of Failure&quot;.	2001-10-31

Recent economic challenges and the hangover from eCommerce clearly have shifted the focus of executives toward cost management and customer service.  In this regard, process issues are highly relevant and offer strong value potential.  <br />Many things have changed since Dr. Hammer's seminal work &quot;Reengineering the Corporation&quot; came out roughly a decade ago.  Most companies now routinely &quot;re-engineer&quot; with the term being a euphemism for layoffs and spending cutbacks.  This was never the original promise of re-engineering and The Agenda does little to re-capture the radical reinvention aspects of BPRE.  This is a shame as new technologies and the lessons learned from the early 1990's have proven the potential of companies to take a fresh look at what they do and how it creates value.<br />The Agenda is a good book for people who are new to the issues of process and the topic of re-engineering.  It covers the basics and provides a fresh look at the technique.  For people who have read Hammer's prior re-engineering books and articles the book offers a few tid-bits regarding the role of process owners and the challenges concerning how to deploy a new business process focused strategy.<br />As it has been little more than a decade since the introduction of BPRE, many executives are coming to this material with prior experience.  It would have been great if the book contained a serious critique of the first wave of reengineering and how a current approach would be better or different.  Unfortunately this was not to be found.<br />This is not to say that the Agenda is a bad book.  In fact some pages are quite insightful.  It ranks up there, just behind Re-engineering the Corporation, as Hammer's best work.  Unfortunately it does seem to recognize how the world has moved on over the last 10 years.	2001-10-16

First it was the Internet and eCommerce.  Then it was Six Sigma.  Now I have had a chance to read this book and regret my delay.  This book is a gem of factual, example filled, and focused insight and understanding.  This is a true manual for changing processes and <br />First the book provides a clear roadmap for process change.  It defines the individual steps necessary as well as the interconnection points between the organization, its processes, measurements and other elements.  While you may not agree with all of the points -- the completeness will give you more than enough ideas to be of value.  <br />Second, the book is well populated with detailed graphical examples that illustrate the concepts and thier intent.  The level of detail, the practicality and the realism of the examples allows you to study the issue, understand it and find parallels in your own business.<br />Lastly, the book is complete it covers issues related to process design, implementation, process owners, measurement and management.  Many people write whole books on one of these aspects however Rummler and Brache have covered them all in a focused and informative text.<br />I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to implement process management, six sigma, or other related changes.  The book provides the details often left out of texts associated with six sigma.  It provides a completeness often missing from process management and design texts. <br />The only drawback to the book is that its writing style is a bit dry and the book, written in 1995 does not cover many of the process innovations enabled through the Internet.  Otherwise this book is a real winner and well worth your attention.	2001-09-12

I agree that &quot;Peopleware&quot; is one of the central books every technology professional should read and apply. However, Slack does not deliver the same level of effectivness and impact.<BR>The first part of the book is ok as it discusses the need for &quot;slack&quot; and the negative effects of having all resources fully optimized on productivity and sustainability. However the second part of the book looses steam rapidly and seems to be just criticism of current conditions rather than helping people make the justification and incorporate slack into their business practices.<br />DeMarco is a giant in the software industry that many of the new technology professionals should get to know and recognize. I would strongly recommend that they meet DeMarco through his other works -- Peopleware in particular rather than this work.	2001-09-06

So I tried another one of his works.  Carrion Comfort was supposed to be a magnum opus and at over 800 pages it was certainly an opus.  Unfortunately the book, while having a great premise devolves into predictable and repeated acts involving knives, guns, and body parts to the point of nausia.  The first use of each of these devices is clever and interesting however repeated use dulls the effect and drags the story out too long.  This would have been a superior 300 page book if only the author and the editor could control themselves.  While not the Heavens Gate of books, a very weak, predictable ending and too much racist overtones -- yes racist -- makes this book one to pass on. <br />I am finished reading Simmons, now and for a long time.  If this is what passes for the genre, then you can keep it.  Sorry to be harsh but I would not waste your time here.	2001-08-09

Skip it, this is Lewis's &quot;mulligan&quot;	Michael Lewis is a gifted story teller when he is talking about a single subject, most often a person.  I read his book on Jim Clark &quot;The New New Thing&quot; with great interest.  However, Lewis does not live up to his talent.  In golf when you make a bad shot its called a &quot;mulligan&quot; or do over.  This is Lewis's mulligan, in my humble opinion.<br />This book reads like his left over notes from talking to people about the internet.  His central premise, that the internet lets you go beyond your normal persona, is a topic better suited for pulp magazines and newspaper &quot;Lifestyle&quot; sections.  The stories he tells of teenage lawyers and stock traders was old news in over a year ago!  <br />In addition the stories have no life in them they are mearly repeating what has been said before.  Case in point is the three pages of Court Testimony Lewis copies into his book when discussing a 14 year old day trader.  This isn't writing its reporting.  <br />I get the distinct feeling that Lewis had some leftover notes from his work on &quot;new new thing&quot; and that he rounded them up with some money from the BBC to write this book.<br />If your still reading this review, I would skip this one entirely as there is little here in terms of insight or fresh material.  If you have not read the New New Thing, pick it up as it is great.   I would skip this one.	2001-08-09

Unfortunately this book is more of a commercial for the authors services than a discussion of the approach, where it can be applied and how to be successful with it.<br />The book first part of the book is filled with hyperbole and leans heavily on the idea that if it worked for GE and Motorola then it will work for you.  It is important to recognize that the average six sigma project generates less than $100,000 in value.  So the value of the technique is in spreading it out wide and far in your organization and letting the people doing the work improve what they do. <br />This is not an approach for people looking to do transformational change or to address signficiant structural issues.<br />To the authors credit they do describe the six sigma processes and steps at a level that you can understand it and have a conversation about six sigma at a dinner party.  They achieve this result.<br />However, the book does not go much beyond this.  It is very light on the applicaiton of this to services -- a real issue given that most people are employed in service related activities.  It directs people to invest heavily in training black belts in the techniques whcih is the service provided by the authors.<br />For people who have an understanding of TQM techniques much of this is a reconfiguraiton of the techniques not the breakthrough revolution that the book describes.<br />Although this has more detail than Hammer's Rengineering the Corporation, this book is too heavy on the advertising messages to help people understand the technique and its applicability to their business.	2001-07-20

Could your company or customers be described by a metaphor such as &quot;rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic?&quot;  If so then, you have an attention problem.<br />Attention is a scarce commodity that is often misunderstood and mismanaged.  Davenport and Beck bring a unique perspective on the topic that crosses many dimensions of strategic and tactical business.  Attention issues exist within the marketplace, company, business unit, product, team, and individual.  The book breaks this issue down and answers the following fundamental questions about attention:<br />What is attention and how is it different from time management, prioritization and other ideas?<br />What are the different types of attention, how do you recognize them?  How do you act when you or your team is dominated by a particular type?<br />How do you measure attention? <br />How do you manage it?<br />These questions are all incredibly topical in the world of information overload, emails, voicemails, conference calls and meetings.  Given all of the data/information/knowledge raining down on people today it is little wonder that attention is becoming a serious topic.<br />Consider this as the single biggest reason to read this book &quot;One reason that consumer products executives have been able to move into other industries is that they understand how to capture consumer attention&quot; p.93. Attention should be a hallmark of any good executive as clearly those who are able to command attention have a significant advantage in creating wealth for their companies and themselves.<br />The book goes beyond describing the problem to providing tools such as Attentionscape, and techniques to help managers understand where the attention issues lie and how to address them.  These tools give the book a practical basis that is of real value to the reader.  <br />Read this book if you are:<br />-An executive responsible for charting your company's strategy and its implementation<br />- A change agent/leader looking to get their message across and deliver results<br />- A manager responsible for a team of people and the need to produce results<br />- A customer facing professional who has to address customer sales, service, and relationship needs<br />- A marketing executive who needs to understand how to get an inside edge on the competition and gain greater insight about current and potential customers<br />Davenport and Beck present the topic in an informative and open style making the topic of attention something tangible and actionable.  This is not a self help book, pop psychology, or personal management guide.  Rather it is a serious treatment of a subject, attention that is often overlooked and under appreciated in business, customer relationships, leadership, and management.  <br />If you choose to ignore this book, then good luck in gaining the interest, understanding, and cooperation of others that we all need to be successful.	2001-05-14

It is a tough read for people used to the normal business fare.<br />This book is a little like THE NEW NEW THING except that it talks about dozens of people, rather than just one.  And it is written by someone who knows about technology -- really knows.<br />Telecommunications is going through a series of religious wars right now and Gilder clearly chooses sides.  It is important for the reader to understand that most of what he writes in the book is good and relatively neutral.  At times, however, he does show a strong point of view that must be taken into account by the reader.	2001-01-18

Business kiss-n-tell books are a sure sign that a business trend is  working its way into the popular culture and is about to run its course.   Like other business bravado books this book is filled with images of men as  giants of business, prescient in their decisions, and posessing the casual  wisdom that deserves our envy and worship.<br />Do not read this book if you  think it will help tell you what life is like in the valley.  Don't read  this book as a budding entreprenuer looking for an inside track on getting  your business plan funded.<br />Do read the book if you looking for a piece of  quasi-fiction.  Its a real story and I know some of the players  professionaly and there the book is somewhat accurate.  But this is not a  documentary of the life of Benchmark, rather it is more like a  made for TV  movie (I am sure that Stross has sold the rights). Entertaining but only as  entertainment.<br />The Monk and the Riddle is a better book for addressing  the meta-physical decisions required to make the leap and launch a  business.	2000-09-08

Rather it is a good look  at how to think about the relationship between life and work, passion and  profits. <br />Definately worth the time, gives you pause to think, and has a  message without being preachy or egotistical.	2000-08-24

I like many of you previous readers bought the book thinking that it would  tell me about B2B exchanges, something that is red hot.  Unfortunately this  book is in the worst tradition of writing about hot topics.  There is  little here in terms of content, insight, or useful information.  The  authors repeatedly refer to the works of others rather than stating their  own opinions or ideas.  In addition their information is dated in many  circumstances.<br />People looking for useful information should consult the  many fine eCommerce business magazines such as Business 2.0, Fast Company,  Industry Standard, Red Herring, etc.  They have significantly better  information, greater accuracy, and a presentation that provides you with  knowledge you can use.<br />B2B Exchanges has a great title -- one that I am  sure is driving sales by itself.  Unfortunately it really fails to deliver.  There is little of value here. <br />My suggestion, if you haven't done it yet  read Kevin Kelly's New rules for the new econonmy (frequently cited by the  authors) and then read the business magazines mentioned above.  You will  save yourself alot of hassle and the disappointment of spending good money  and time on a book that really doesn't deliver.<br />I am being so harsh with  this review because this book really wasted my time and I felt duped by the  title. Hopefully my loss will be your benefit.	2000-08-21

The book is largely a rehash of the earlier works - a fact that is touted in a Fast Company article on Moore.   <br />Well, the book could be a good synopsis of his other work, bringing  newcommers up to speed fast. It isn't.  Large blocks of text from his  earlier work seem to be copied into this one (sorry to be harsh)with  limited positioning or arguement.  The book does not flow.<br />Moore's  earlier books are terriffic, and explain how things work.  People wanting  to understand this body of work would be better off buying and reading the  other books rather than going through this one.  Even through that takes  more time and costs more money.<br />His inclusion of the value disciplines at  the end of the work appears more like a bolt-on that adds little  value.<br />In short, skip this one -- no new ground broken here.  Read the  other books Crossing the Chasm and then Gorilla Game.  This will give you a  better understanding of the ideas and implications.  <br />Fault line  unfortunately does not deliver.	2000-07-27

Its a text book in terms of the style its written in, tone, and level of insight.  If you are looking for a broad based reference book then its OK.

However the book treats the subject too lightly, I get the impression that all business will soon be DisneyWorld. <br />The book's examples -- most focused  on entertainment -- makes the concept appear trite and limited.  Needed  more real business issues and examples for my taste.<br />I agree that  experience is important, perhaps critical to the future--but this book does  not give me much to go on.	2000-07-19

The book is filled with bland examples, limited detail, and few conclusions.  If you  are looking to actually crack the value code and make the tough decisions  necessary to compete in the digital economy.  This one is not it.  Save  your money and save your time.<br />Sorry to be so harsh, but the book doesn't  live up to the repuation of a big company like AA !	2000-07-18

The cluetrain manefasto is a great wedge book to open up your eyes and think about the new econmy.  The 95 theses are terrific, I only wish that the text dealt more with the  implications of these theses.  <br />Instead the text rages on about how the  status quo is going to be overwhelmed by the new economy.  It is fine to  rant, however, there is little value add after you have vented your  frustration.  You will feel better after reading Cluetrain but you will  still not have a clue.<br />If you want to do something in the new economy, go  to the website and print out the theses.  Use the time you would spend  reading the book addressing the issues raised by the theses.	2000-07-18

Unfortunately the book reads like an extended IBM consulting sales pitch.  The central case study (Westpac) is over 10 years old. Surly  if this was a break through the book would talk about long term results and  how they were able to take over their market by being adaptive. There is  little evidence of this.   Other examples are internally focused about how  IBM's training and education have become more adaptive.<br />Not enough detail  to warrant the read or to get a real idea of how you would implement the  concepts. <br />If you are looking for guidance on eCommerce and competing in  hyper competition. It is not here.	2000-06-27

The first 100 or so pages are a good review of the need for prototyping and its  application.  The real jewels of the book are past the first 100 pages  where he talks about the application, measurement, and culture aspects of  prototyping.	2000-05-15

This book provides an interested,if sometimes disturbing, view of the future.  Stephanson's prose are gritty, clean, and  surprisingly smart.  He knows how to write a fast paced and sophisticated  book. If you like irony and juxtaposition this is a great book.  Not  traditional science fiction but a cross between SCI-FI and Techno-thriller.	1999-12-17

The premise, that you compete on reach or richeness, provides a way of distinguishing the  various paths through eC as well as the impact of eCommerce on business  models and market structures.  Overall, the book is worth the read,  however, the authors rely too heavily on the richness/reach framework so it  shows some wear-n-tear latter on in the book.  This is a strategy/economics  type work, so if you are looking for implementation guidance this is not  the book for you.  If you are looking for something that will help explain  what eCommerce may be doing to your company and markets its as good as  anything out there and better than most.	1999-12-15

What is surprising about the book is that it is very non-consulting-ease even through the author is  a former Managing Partner from McKinsey &amp; Co. The first person account  and stories contain mulitple nuggets of what it takes to be a real leader.   You may have to wade through a few stories that seem a bit self serving of  the author.  However, these are only the recollections of a lifetime of  leadership so they are certainly allowable.  Other books on leadership  (Kotter et al) provide a more scientific view, however Bower's been there  and this is what its like approach gives the book credibility and value	1999-12-15

This is more the story of corporate change than it is a tale of eBusiness.  Readers  looking for insights into how to succeed in eBusiness will gain limited  insight from this book.  As an eBusiness book its 3 stars. <br />The book is a  good read about how one company wrenched and fretted over changing itself  from the inside out.<br />If you like'd Goldratt's THE GOAL,an allegory that  covers the same space, then you will like this real life story that  continues to unfold.	1999-05-04

The premise of the book is largely based around a cute concept &quot;clockspeed&quot; with a call to concurrently engineer process,  product, and supply chains.  All good premises, however, the author does  little to tell you how those should fit together in pragmatic terms.  The  book is most helpful for people in manufacturing where all of the examples  are from and not people working in the services markets, where clockspeed  has some real meaning.  A visit to the authors web site is futher  demoralizing as Fine has decided to set up a consulting practice around the  concept and book. Overall this is not the best book I've read on working in  the electronic economy.	1998-12-07

The book is poorly structured with examples repeating each other to the point that it looked like the authors were tyring to fill up  the pages rather than write a cogent arguement.  In addition, Bennis goes  for the cheap when he repeatedly discusses the &quot;sexual:&quot; tensions  that existed on these teams.  I'd rather he focused on their dynanmics and  how they were maintained than people's personal lives. If that doesn't  discourage you from the book, this will,  most of these teams were formed  over 30 years ago. This offers little advice or guidance on dealing with  building teams of gen-Xers ect.  That was my reason for reading the work.	1998-10-27

The work is  largely a compilation of ideas, stories, and other items generated by  others over the last 20 years. People looking for the same degree of  clarity found in Martin's groundbreaking Information Engineering series  will be sorely disappointed. There are many better works on this subject  than this.

The book really focuses on competency and not capability.  This makes the  title a misnomer.  However it is a worthwhile read for anyone contemplating  or leading broad scale change.<br />The book is definately not for people from  Human Resources as between the lines there are some fairly cogent  criticisms of traditional HR Departments and their operations.<br />The only  drawbacks to the book are its week testimonials.  Frequent references to  Apple Computer, GE and others appear weak and less than anecdotal.  A few  strong case studies would have raised the value of the book dramatically.  While this shouldn't keep you from reading it, it does cause you to wade  through &quot;fluff&quot; from time to time.	1998-09-24

However his attempt at a conversational style for the book  leaves it very stilted and east coast blue blood.  This detracts from the  power of his messages.  The first 1/3 of the book is great with clear  definitions and descriptions.  The middle third drones a bit rehashing the  first 1/3rd.  The final 3rd doesn't deliver enough conclusions and items  for the reader to take action against.  Overall it is a worthwhile piece,  however I've found Davenport &amp; Prusak's &quot;Working Knowlege&quot; to  have more practicable advice and infomration.	1998-09-21

Buffett's previous works have been great at balancing a fun story with some deeper meaning.  This book can be summed up in a few sentences.  Got allot of money, love to fly, love to fish, go ahead and live vicariously through me.  This is not what Buffett's music has been about, although if you listen to Banana Wind, you knew a book like this was coming.  Spend you money on his other books, well worth it, and skip this one.	1998-07-20

The author does not provide any rational, framework or theory for why these things can be fortold other than some vauge references to chaos and some politically correct references to the Santa Fe Institute.  A real disappointment; it is written more like a newpaper narrative of what is rather than an analysis of why it is or what it should be.

Not full of platitudes like the pop-reengineering guru's just real hard looks at how re-engineering affects specific aspects of your operation.  I found the piece on reengineering and IT strategy particularly enligntening give the excessive hype over technology.
