In this book you will love some of the characters and hate many of them. You will be surprised often. You will turn pages long after you should have gone to bed. You will run right out and get the next book in the series when you have finished the Game of Thrones. This book has a complex plot and story line that is approached from several points of view. Every character has issues and you find that their issues are what really make the story come to life. The children really make this book wonderful. The children are all unique and it is through them that this story takes shape. If you love fantasy you love this book, if you don't love fantasy, this book might make you think again.	2003-08-12

I am an avid fan of Stevens and Crummel and this book is by far my favorite of the books they have done. The pictures are outstanding. The way the old nursury rhymes are interpreted is wonderful, the interactions of the characters are funny (even for adults, maybe even more so.) If you like good picturebooks, this one will not disappoint. I highly recommend this book. I do read-alouds with my students (middle school) every year, and every year when I read this book, by the end of the year I have had 15 to 20 requests to see and hear it again. The great thing is that when I do read this one aloud, they are all listening and enjoying the story. Buy it!	2003-08-12

I am happy that I bought this book because it is clear in it's instructions for building a strip canoe, but unfortunately it is not also a motivational book. I started my canoe 6 months ago and I poke around at it from time to time, I figure I might have it done by the time I retire (and that's a few years off still). I must say that this book is easy to use, easy to understand and has been helpful when I have felt stuck. The fact that I procrastinate is not a fault of this book. If you want to build a strip canoe, this book is a great place to start.	2003-08-12

The book is not only a great way to get you creative juices lowing, but it is an inspiring read. Many of my students enjoy the interludes between activities as much as the activities themselves. <BR>I would encourage any teacher to make this a part of your poetry toolbox.	2002-05-14

If you are looking for a fun and interesting commentary on the &quot;evolution&quot; of our current educational system, you will enjoy this book. It is tongue in cheek while hitting the mark about trends in the educational system. This book comments on everything from religion to marriage to economics to afterschool programs. <br />The characters Wayne and Peddiwell are wonderful, especially after they down several tequila daisies.	2002-05-14

It has all the information that you could possibly need to get to, and successfully fish almost any public and many private bodies of water. <br />I would also recommend that you carry a copy of the State fishing regs. Some of the things the author says about open season and where you can fish on some river systems has changed.<br />All in all, this is the second best investment I have made in my fishing hobby. (The first being my license.)	2001-12-04

This book needs to be read and relished and understood from the outset or it probably will offend some Christian folks. If you take the time to understand that this book is not really even about our world, but a world like ours, the offense should be put to bed. <br />I thought the story to be so well crafted that I have recommended it to many adults. The great thing is that many of my students have read and enjoyed all of the books in the trilogy. They often tell me that they enjoyed Golden Compass the most of the three. <br />Once I began to read I could not put the book down. It is not for the constant action, but for the story. The characters are dynamic and demand the attention of the reader. You will like Lyra and Pantalaimon, not because they have special powers, but because they are charming and clever.<br />Golden Compass has a lot going for it. A unique and powerful storyline, well developed characters, a wonderful setting and although it is a little slow at times it has a magnetism that will draw you back to it each time you put it down.<br />This is quite possibly the most interesting young adult fantasy novel I have encountered.	2001-12-04

This book seems to me to have little new information in it. I enjoyed reading it because it got me thinking about possibilities and I am now researching those possibilities in depth. It seems that most people will come away from this book thinking that you can go buy a bunch of property and get rich. It's actually a little more tricky than that. <br />This book speaks in generalities. If you want an in-depth, how-to book on becoming wealthy this is not it. It is a jumping off point for me. It made me think about my million-dollar idea and how to make it a million dollar reality. I am now looking at authors like John Maxwell, Zig Ziglar, Dale Carnegie, Napoleon Hill and others to build my skills. <br />This book is good, in that it may inspire you to look at possibilities. If you just need a start, check out Rich Dad, Poor Dad.	2001-12-04

If you want to learn the basics of fly fishing there are other books that will teach you more. If you want to catch the allure of flyfishing this is a pretty good book.<br />The information that you will recieve in the &quot;instruction&quot; parts of the book are standard and can be found in any how-to book. The thing that I liked so much more about Shadowcasting are the Sidebars. <br />The Sidebars are essays about flyfishing and what it is about on a more personal or perhaps even spiritual level. I appreciated the insights offered in the sidebars.<br />For the absolute beginner, stick to the Curtis Creek Manifesto, for someone who has experienced flyfishing and has not given up, this is a book you should read. It looks good on a coffee table and has helped begin several conversations on the art of flyfishing. <br />Don't buy this to learn how to flyfish, buy it to learn why we flyfish.	2001-12-04

Sometimes finding books that 7th and 8th graders will enjoy is a daunting task, but here you have a book and a series that these kids love.<br />I am impressed by the quality of the characters and the plot. I am impressed with the detailed descriptions of the settings in and around Redwall Abbey. I am impressed by the page turning qualities of the plot. I am impressed that even my most reluctant readers are able to get into the story of Redwall and the creatures that abide there. Matthias is a wonderful hero, and Cluny the Scourge is a dastardly villlian, you will love and hate them respectively. All of the supporting characters add to the story and move it along nicely. You'll love the twists and turns of the story of Matthias finding his place in life, his destiny.<br />Brian Jacques is a wonderful story teller and has mastered the art of writing for the imagination.<br />I recommend this book highly. I enjoyed it, my students enjoyed it, you will enjoy it.	2001-06-21

With a very basic understanding of latin, this book is a useful tool for building skill. It helps to understand fully the grammar of latin or at least grammar in general. I would not give this book to someone with only a marginal understanding of grammar and expect them to teach themself latin.<br />This is however a great book as latin texts go. I recommend its use by anyone who wants to hone their language skills.	2001-06-21

If you take this book for more than entertainment you will probably be a little disappointed. If you want to laugh and groan, then this is a book you should read. O'Reily is pompous, arrogant, opinionated, brash, egotistical, sarcastic, blunt and harsh at times, but he is entertaining. <br />This is better than anything Rush Limbaugh put out. It's entertaining. <br />O'Reilly doesn't pull punches with anyone. He's entertaining. <br />If you are looking for deep political or moral insight, look elsewhere. If you want to be entertained, this is a book you ought to read.	2001-06-21

It is great for planning, but I was left thinking, &quot;now what?&quot; I figured it out, but it took a little doing on my part.

In the spirit of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn, Bud, Not Buddy is a great adventure story of a boy looking for family. Bud is intelligent, resourceful and interesting. A character brought to life by Curtis and his wonderful sense of detail. My reluctant readers have all enjoyed this book. <br />Set in Flint, MI during the depression, this book has a great historical basis. This gives kids an idea of what life might have been like for youngsters in the late 30's. Curtis communicates a sense of hope and determination that moves the book along until the moving ending. <br />Good for read aloud in the middle school.	2001-05-09

Stargirl is about individuality, peer pressure, love, cruelty, disappointment and loss. It is thoughtful and mystical. Spinelli spins a wonderful yarn through the eyes of Leo Burlock. The story is about the stange new girl, Stargirl Caraway. Stargirl dresses different, she acts different, she is different than anyone the students at Mica High have ever encountered, and they clamor to her for awhile. Then things change because Stargirl won't. Despite pressures from Mica High students and Leo, Stargirl must be who she is. She is comfortable with that even if those around her are not. Leo must make a choice, does he value acceptance from his peers or Stargirl's affection more? What will he choose? How will he choose? Why must he choose? Leo is faced with all of these questions and more.<br />Stargirl is masterfully written. The characters are alive and you can almost see and smell the desert. You will find that you are drawn into this book and that you will want to read it a second time if only to savor the story once again. Spinelli has crafted a splendid book that is worth your consideration.	2000-12-28

Seedfolks is an interesting book in that it brings together so many diverse perspectives to tell a very simple yet powerful story.<br />The idea of an intercity garden is wonderful. Especially on that is started by a little girl working to honor her father's memory. The garden becomes not only a memorial to him, but to humanity and the potential that lies therein.<br />The Gibb Street garden is a picture of what our nation is and how it could be. People working side by side being productive, taking pride in their work, working hard to make their lives better; relying on their own skill and the help of neighbors to create something truly worhtwhile.<br />Seedfolks appears to be a simple book, but it goes deep. It touches on very basic human needs and desires and how easily they are left unmet and unfulfilled and yet how easily that can all be changed. It is about unity. It is about community. It is about all of us.<br />I use Seedfolks to teach perspective in writing to middle school students, and they take away more than that. They begin to see how important community is and how even they can be a part of a community. This is a powerful little book.	2000-12-28

I started to read Left Behind several months ago, and unlike most reviewers, I didn't like it. I kept picking it up and putting it down nut it just didn't appeal to me.<br />I picked up The Mark and I was pleasantly surprised. It's much better than I had hoped. It is interesting. It is a quick paced book. It has elements of a good spy novel, and it kept me turning the pages. I read the book in two days. (My family shared in the reading as it was easy to read aloud.) <br />I approached reading The Mark as a &quot;last ditch&quot; attempt to get into the Left Behind series. I must admit, I think I might go back and read some of the other books. If they are as good as The Mark I will be pleased. <br />The Mark is highly enjoyable reading.	2000-12-08

After turning the Invention Convention into a teachers worst nightmare they end up in detention and that's where the fun really starts.<br />This book is full of the same &quot;poo poo humor&quot; of the first book, but I enjoyed it more.

Peter Lynch is as down to earth as can be in his book &quot;One Up On Wall Street&quot;. He talks about the fears and delusions that we all work under as individual investors. In drawing from his own experiences as Fidelity's  Magellan fund manager he shows his readers both his successes and his  blunders. <br />This is a great book for anyone who wants a primer on picking  winning stocks. It would also be a good discussion piece for an investment  club. <br />It's writing in good plain language with quite a bit of tongue in  cheek humor about the Wall Street gurus. <br />Highly enjoyable in a world of  bland investment books.	2000-06-20

In signing agreements and feeling as though you are going to be bound to a group for a long term endeavour,  this book helps to ease the anxiety that goes along with the club forming  experience. <br />As with any other Motley Fool book this one has a reasonable  balance of good, clear concise information, and foolish humor. <br />As a  primer for beginners, this book is the best I've seen. It has lots of  samples of forms and the agreements and by-laws. It is written at a level  that any investor should understand what is going on.<br />I highly recommend  this book to anyone interested in starting an investment club.	2000-06-20

After reading several &quot;Investment guides&quot; I was beginning to think that you either have to be exceptionally boring, or overly technical to write anything about investing.

With pencil and calculator in hand, I  went through the entire workbook and now really have a clear picture of my  own financial situation and how &quot;foolish&quot; investing will work for  me.  This book helps to clear up some of the hazy concepts that you might  read about in other Motley Fool publications (ie. Foolish 4 and other Dow  techniques). I say this is a great book to go through after reading the  Motley Fool Investors Guide. It contains the same irreverent humor and  lively writng and really reinforces everything the Gardners teach.	2000-06-11

It's probably not going to change your life but it should get you to think at least a little. I enjoyed it and recommend it to others, not as a doctrine  to live by, but rather an interesting story to stimulate deeper discussion  about the problem of &quot;fear paralysis&quot;. Having read in other  reviews that this story is &quot;just a parable&quot; I must point out that  all major religions rely on parables to reinforce and teach their beliefs.  There is nothing wrong with a modern parable. This one is pretty good.	2000-01-09
