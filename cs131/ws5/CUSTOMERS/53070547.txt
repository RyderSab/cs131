US	53070547	R1S62WM52R7AHZ	0375406778	246289375	No Country for Old Men	Books	4	2	4	N	Y	Some of this novel is so riveting	that it catches your breath.  As an inveterate McCarthy reader, I was surprised at how spare this novel is.  The first hundred pages or so are unsettling but compelling.  At least he doesn't explain why Moss steals the money and allows us to come to this understanding.  It's a delight to have a writer treat readers respectfully.  When asked if he was sorry to have become a criminal, Moss' response was that he was sorry he hadn't started earlier.<br /><br />Two sections...Chigurh and Wells and later with Chigurh and Carla Jean run on too long and tend to meander and that is my only criticism.<br /><br />Sheriff Bell's story and comments especially his WWII guilt morally anchor the novel and provide juxtaposition for Wells, Chigurh and Moss.	2005-07-21

If you enjoy the genre, this has the trappings for a good trilogy.  I do not fault the author as much as I do the copy editor.  Too many repetitions using the same language.  How many times do we have to endure Maya's dilemma as a Harlequin?  The characters are resoundingly flat and this should have been addressed.  During some conversations everyone has the same voice.  Boone could have been a delectable character but switches over to bad guy cliche.  The trilogy can be salvaged with some better writing and editing.	2005-07-14

I read Crais when he first published The Monkey's Raincoat and have been a fan of the series.  However, with this outing I think Crais uses broad character brushstrokes and largely relies on his plot and there are plot gaps with this book's nemesis.<br /><br />This is a morose Cole given to mooning over his love and wearing his heart on his sleeve.  Nothing in here helps us understand this any better.  A big problem is in seeing in Cole what inspires Joe Pike's loyalty...it's not in this one.  Sure, those who have read the series can backload that relationship but careful writers find ways of connecting this with the reader.  The Starkey stuff is so broad it is almost farcical.  I hate to say this but Crais is reminding me of Robert Parker with this book and relying solely on a fan base without having to do any real writing.  Parker's last severl books are strictly formula and the relationships simply props for the plot. Those who haven't fallen into that trap who come to mind are George Pelacanos who shifts his characters all around and finds interesting new ones and Lawrence Block who keeps inventing new ways of making Matt Scudder fresh and his relationships believable.	2005-02-28

These are stories of people who step-up and become a little bit better than they were.  The characters in these stories, no matter what has happened in thier lives, get the opportunity to be better than they were whether it be to love more deeply, commit when commitment isn't possible, or be brave even if you are the only one who knows of your bravery.  It is nice to read redemptive stories.  This book reminds me of how unfulfilled I have been for such stories.

I was young enough to be influenced by Namath and saw him as one of us who made good.  However, the main reason I wanted to read this biography was because I was interested in how place affected the personality.  It is rare that Namath is ever mentioned without mentioning his roots.  He is one athlete we strongly associate with backround.  The author does attend to this theme by speculating how Namath's background influenced decisons he made focusing especially on his confidence as an athlete.  I gave this book a four because I think the author fails us at the end.  The last twenty years of Namath's life are covered in just a few pages.  I would like to have seen more interviews with people who might have had some insight other than a few former teammates and various hangers-on. The author does do a creditable job of pieceing together a highly unusual and ultimately sad life.<br /><br />Namath was very typical of a number of guys I grew up with who hung around the Blue Room and played sports.  Namath's swagger came from BF, as well as his \\"you need me, I don't need you\\" attitude.  Beaver Falls produced a lot of Namaths.  Not necessarily Namath wannabees but actual Namaths.  I see them around and at class reunions.<br /><br />Ultimately, when Joe entered the world of adult responsibility, it was way too late and he had no tools or blueprints as to how adults behave. I am struck by the number of people who devoted themselves to Joe for so very long, and ultimately were cast aside without a word or any conscience on Joe's part.<br /><br />But then again, he was cool for a long time.	2004-09-13

You'll decide if the author was successful or not as you wait at one pont for the other shoe to drop (speaking of cliches).  I have yet to decide if the unnamed narrator and the restricted aspect of this personal point of view works as well as an alternative point of view might have worked.  I've been reading this author since he first published and greatly admire his short fiction.  I had read three of these chapters as exerpts in magazines and found them powerful by themselves.  This novel has that quality of an episodic collection of stories for at least the the first three or four chapters.	2004-04-06

This book should be read after Man With an Ax because they are so tied toether and more fun for the reader.  I think Jackson ranks up near the top with George Pelacanos.  His writing and characters stay fresh and interesting.  I've been reading this author since his first book and my sense is that he is still having fun doing this.  Some comments refer to the fact that there is less Mulheisen than expected...but this is what makes Jackson fresh...some new riffs on old characters.	2004-03-24

The author writes a 19th century novel the way it might have been written 150 years ago.  In terms of scope, I think this novel closely resembles A.B. Guthrie's, The Big Sky, more than anything else.  It takes time to tackle these Post Modern pieces and it takes a while to care about anyone in here but gradually the reader begins to understand the relationships.  A lot of stuff goes unsaid which I think speaks well for any writer.  We know that Aloysius is a devoted friend to Custis and we figure it out without being clubbed with it.  The relationship between Jerry Potts and Custis also figures in this vein.  I would like to have read more of Potts' story.  My only criticism and it is mild is that Charles narrates a bit too long.<br />If you want to read something ultimately satisfying in non traditional ways, this might be your ticket.	2004-03-08

I started reading Jackson when he first started and would catch back up to him every four or five years.  So I am catching back up.  It was great to see Grootka resurrected and so in character.  This novel is a lot of fun with all the Jackson trademarks of character, Detroit life, music, etc.  The only other writer in this genre who I think is as good as Jackson in similar ways (DC life and popular culture) is George Pelacanos.  If you are new to this author don't start here.  It pays to start at the beginning simply because it is more fun that way.	2004-03-08

The man is a great story teller and the characters always seem like people I've met.  In this story the world of the late sixties is vividly recreated as a world stage.  The friendship lies at the core of this novel and how it starts and then develops occupies a nice portion of this book.  Mundy's early life also is a neat story within a story.  All aspects of this friendship rang true to me.  I have and had friends like Sasha.  The anti American plot element is deserved but certainly not vitriolic by any means.  If this is the first time reading this author, I would not recommend starting with this one.  I'd say start with the Constant Gardener, then the Smiley novels and that will give you a great sense of how this author peoples his world.	2004-02-26

The theme is one that should interest most.  However, the editing is poor and distracting.  The author spends the first twenty or so pages convincing us that he is a witty guy.  Once the author commits to the story, the writing improves.  I couldn't help but think that in the hands of a good editor that this book had great possibilities, especially if the characters were more memorable and life on the Island was more fully realized.	2004-01-26

I was dusappointed to note that these &quot;fictions&quot; were recycled and juxtaposed with different contexts.

He is terse and his harbitten style underscores the rough Louisianna setting.  However, at first, EVERYBODY says clever stuff all the time, but then the story started to take over and the author had the sense to minimize the cleverness and let the story tell itself. Everybody still says clever stuff but this is an interesting story and slowly the secondary characters are also drawn into it and the book becomes a decent read.<br />The author's style and character development reminded me of Pete Dexter especially in Paris Trout and the Paperboy, but unlike Dexter's novels where the reader is constantly cringing at what might happen, The Clearing, is an honest attempt at story telling during a time and era when there were really legends.	2003-07-15

To me, this is why I found the voices so authentic.  I am Vince's age and shared his attitude toward those of his father's generation.  There is little narration and much stream of conscious thinking which makes the book, at times, hard to follow.  Develop a score card of characters and relationships early since it does get confusing.  Ultimately the four stars are for the implicit language which limits the scope of the book somewhat.  Although the dialog is onviously authentic, I know that I missed some things since I am not from the neighborhood and the dialog almost assumes that a reader must be from nearby.	2003-05-20

Look at Parker and Crais and sometimes Connelly, certainly Sandford. But not Pelacanos.  I saw another review that chastised the author for his DC wanderings and his sidetrips into music and westerns.  I always check out what the characters are listening to, reading or watching...it's half the fun of a Pelacanos novel.  The other thing is the DC as small town theme.  Any of Pelacanos characters are likely to show up in any series.  I like this post modern aspect to the noirish crime novel.  The bad guys are never boring; The good guys never too smart for their own good.  I'd be hard pressed to tell any newcomer where to start with this writer.  Just start somewhere and then figure it out for yourself.	2003-03-13

Coetzee or Pat Barker, but I can't exactly dismiss it either.  Pi's religious issues, his binary issues, and his species issues are all entertaining.  I half heartedly looked for representations but can't say I was interested enough in Pi to go on.  Compared to Coetzee and the characters from Disgrace or Barker's the Ghost Road (Mann-Booker winners), Pi doesn't stay with a reader long enough for deeper introspection. I thought the algae island and the two boat dialogs the highlight of the book.	2003-02-11

I even liked the early books he doesn't.  I read his poetry and kept track of his work up through Off to the Side.  I subscribe to Esquire and Men's Journal so I read many of the \\"Raw and the Cooked\\" pieces and saw early printings of various novellas. (I read \\"Legends\\" in Esquire in one sitting at my kitchen table.  Hey, I was born poor too) This is some context for my remarks. Who does one write a memoir for?  I guess my hope is that a memoir by an author is for his readers.  If you are hoping for this, you'll be disappointed.  It seems this memoir was for Harrison and probably his family and a few close friends listed toward the end.  As for people who have been reading his work, maybe we're just better off reading his work.  When a writer writes a memoir, I am interested in understanding what he/she reads and how he/she reads.  Harrison mentions a number of writers but he doesn't say much about what he got from them (except near the end when he reveals a bit of what Notes From the Underground meant for him).  I am interested in how events shaped writing and thinking.  What we get are anecdotes.  Harrison knew many writers who I like to read but we learn nothing of interest through his encounters.  Ultimately, this memoir seems to me self absorbed.  As if it were time to do the \\"memoir\\" thing.  I guess I was naïve enough to think that writers consider their readers, but I don't think Harrison knows anything about his readers except as schmucks who go to his book signings that he was trying mightily to get out of. (I've never been to a book signing.)  Is Off to the Side entertaining?  Yes.  Is it well written in Harrison's distinctive voice? Yes.  Did Harrison have a life interesting enough to write about?  Yes.  Do we learn anything about his writing or reading or his take on other writers and their ideas?  No.  The rating is higher than it probably should be, but like Harrison, I hate to admit that something I spent time on reading wasn't worth my time.pent time on reading wasn't worth my time.	2002-11-18

July, July is much better than Tomcat...but it does not come up to In the Lake of the Woods.  I had read many of the tales in July in NYer or Esquire and I really believe that these tales worked better as short stories than as tied together class reunion tales. Everyone in July has these 2-5 word pithy comebacks.  Voices aren't distinct as they were in Things They Carried and Casciato.  It was hard keeping everyone straight for the first half of the book because they all had the same voice when he writes reunion dialog.  The novel reads quickly but nothing stays.  When I read several of the stories earlier, I thought their impact was far more lasting.  There's no doubt he's a clever writer.  However, people of our generation with our experiences need far less clever and much more depth in understanding these experiences.	2002-09-24

The publisher was really pushing it, and I bought a copy because of the nature of the &quot;Canon Wars&quot; that currently rage across  English Departments in the US.  I knew of Carol's other book about the  poems of Nikki Giovanni and liked her approach.  I was interested in how  she planned to tell us about teaching the classics to all our students not  just the select.  Carol thinks the classics are for everyone.  She feels  that what we call &quot;Great Literature&quot; is great for good reason,  but she fears that more and more the classics are the domain of our honors  groups, our advanced college prep kids or for our gifted classes.  Carol  fears that high interest, easy reads may become the mainstay for many  teachers and with good reason.  Carol purports that teaching the classics  is not an assignment from hell where bored kids are turned away from  literature forever.  Carol sees the teaching of the classics as a model for  the way we teach thinking.  She feels that kids learn content from the  classics, yes,  but they learn far more.  Kids learn how to think about the  great ideas that come from great books.  She says the way we do this is by  making the classics relative.  The great themes of love, war, inhumanity,  humanity are still the themes we all know and relate to.  By making the  classics relative to our kids, we examine again the questions and problems  we all have been wrestling with.  Carol suggests that the way to teach the  classics is not in isolation.  Carol believes that classics must be taught  by using all sorts of other &quot;texts&quot;. A text to Carol may be the  L.A. Times if it helps her make a point. It's teachers, ultimately, who  make the difference.  It is how teachers themselves read and relate to what  they read and then how teachers reconceptualize a content and deliver it to  students.  What I like about Carol's approach is that it is not about  power, but about sharing and exchanging. The English teacher who knows all  the answers and interpretations is not Carol Jago.  Carol's reading of  literature impacts her own life and her book is about how other  readers...teachers as well as students...share the impact of literature on  their lives.  Carol does this by dealing with important issues for teachers  like...what is appropriate and what isn't; whether or not to use film;  assessing your teaching of the classics and assessing their reading of the  classics; and how we as teachers reflect upon our own practice.  Carol is  obviously a real reader as suggested by her book lists at the end.  There  is a list for everyone.  Finally, Carol talks about what the Classics are,  whose notion of what is classic literature and how these works have  withstood the effects of time and countless teachings.  I think this book  is essential reading for any high school English teacher and I challenge  high school English department chairs to buy the book for their teachers,  form literature circles, and continue the discussion.about  power, but about sharing and exchanging.

Good literature has the power to transform readers, and Coetzee's novel has that power.  Disgrace is a reflection on both man's  inhumanity and his capacity for change.

Only a few things surprised me.  Then, the appendix I found so much more interesting.  I liked the case study with just the initials and the 'Sergeant Friday&quot; narrator.  The case study was like watching a really good stripper who reveals nothing.  The story from the case study did not put life where it was intended.  If you are going to take us on this ride, give us an interesting narrator.	1998-03-03
