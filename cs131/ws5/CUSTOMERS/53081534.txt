This isn't a classic.  Somehow it isn't as rich in details.  The original was very complicated.  This is thin, flat and unsatisfying.  Somehow Fry's story has more white space in the text, you just feel you are missing out on the beautiful details and plot twists and complexity of characters. <br /> <br />Dumas made each act of revenge seem fitting.  Fry makes it seems just dirty and petty.  Dumas had characters with doubt, Fry has characters too flat to doubt. <br /> <br />Go read Dumas, the (original) book was better.	2005-04-30

It just isn't the Mycroft Holmes from Conan-Doyle (which is kind of distracting).  There is no Holmesian deduction, Mycroft isn't Mycroft, I don't know why this wasted Mycroft's name on this.

And he proves it by timing how long it takes to recite his first chapter and coming in at 6 minutes and a couple of seconds, while clearly making his point. <br /> <br />If you can get your point across, clearly and forcefully, succinctly then you should.  The amount of time wasted in excessive verbiage is staggering. <br /> <br />Step one to improving productivity by saving time in meetings and presentations is realizing there's a problem.  Step two is figuring out how to shorten a presentation to make it more effect (not just shorter). Step three is motivating people to apply step 2. <br /> <br />This is a concise book on how to give a concise, effective, presentation. <br />	2004-08-13

It has a raised metallic inking of a dragon on the cover (you can't tell in the picture that it is metallic ink or that it is raised).  There are 3 'marbles' embedded into the think cover.  The pages are very thick, card-stock like, paper.  There are lots of little folding pieces and little things with metallic foil glued on.  It's amazing they can offer this for about $13. <br /> <br />It's only 32 pages long because each page is think material.  Lots of color and illustration (but the color isn't garish or overdone, more pastels and ink drawings; the pages are tinted.) <br /> <br />The writing is nice.  The humor is kept subtle (like saying if one is going to be a dragonologist then one of the things you need is a field notebook...which should be heat resistant). <br /> <br />Have fun looking at dragon information in a book that is a work of bookmaking art.	2004-08-10

Now it is weak, boring and dull.<br />My interpretation of the series was that when you have a group of unusual people and a problem you should find an unusual solution.  And I think part of the fun was watching Phule find the unusual solution.  So how come Phule hardly shows up at all?<br />The writing is confusing.  They introduced a 'Lepoid', a new alien.  But what does it look like?  How does it act?  Took me until near the end of the book to put the poor descriptions together.  Things come out of no where; it looks like this is an attempt to surprise us, I'd rather have a solid setup and then a surprise!<br />Shoot the editor!  There are words missing in the middle of the text.  Didn't anyone bother to proof read this?  (Shoot whoever 'set' the type or however they do it these days, too).<br />If you haven't read this series before then don't start with this one, go back and read the first in the series, Phule's Company, it's much better.  You might read this if you've already read the rest of the series, but remember: I warned you, you'll be disappointed.	2004-05-08

I was kind of disappointed on page 2 when that illusion was shattered.  Then things got really confusing.  <br />I've got a friend who has studied writing and whenever we discuss books she points out something she learned that people can't read a story with more than 6 active characters without getting confused.  This has way more than the maximum number of characters.<br />This is actually three parallel stories, which may or may not be co-temporaneous (who knows?  I've read it and I'm still not sure what is going on.)  Any one of the three plots would be an interesting story, and the individual plots are very well written, but when you have them in parallel it is absolutely confusing!<br />I'm so confused that I'm not even willing to tackle the sequel that may bring everything together and explain it.	2003-12-25

The production values are excellent with great color reproduction.  The art is beautiful, the beautiful women are gorgeous, the monsters are truely monstrous.<br />The plot for this arc revolves around the guild masters who have lost their sign of legitimacy, the ancient guild spirits, and are desperate to not lose political power.  Nearly maddened by the fear they hatch a plot to release the most horrible threat the planet of Ciress has ever faced and then betrayer her again.  It's a plan of absolute madness...obviously there are going to be problems.  (In fact they will still be trying to clean them up in volume 3; but this is still a nicely selfcontained story arc.)<br />A 5-star book with a place of honor on my shelves.	2003-12-25

They actually figured out mass production without knowing what they were doing, they figured out marketing from scratch, they encountered financing and survived.<BR>2)They had a near masochistic willingness to work.  Boy did these guys work hard (it would kill me to do what they did, even if I had the will to do it).<BR>3)They could adapt incredibly.<br />4) and finally:  There are pitfalls and prices to trying to make social profits and business profits at the same time and to not planning your company to be as big as it already is.<br />You can learn about businesses in their growth phase from this book.  You can learn about making sure a company has sufficient controls in place for its size.  You may be able to learn whether you have what it takes to be an entrepeneur.<br />The first 3/4th of the book were fun to read but for some reason the last couple of chapters, when Ben and Jerry were playing less of a part in the business, were slow and boring (I don't exactly know why but I know they dragged).	2003-10-12

This doesn't even seem like a Tom Clancy Novel.  <br />There's not enough action, and considering one of the characters is supposed to be an intelligence analyst I was looking forward to clever deduction and analysis, which for me would count as action.  There wasn't enough of it.<br />The characters are too 'chatty'.  People just don't talk like that, the only reason for saying things like they do is that there is an invisible observer (the reader) watching at the moment.  A lot of material is about updating us to Tom Clancy's alternate history of the United States, but people don't talk about basic details of modern history, they already know it. It was nice of him to try to work the history in but there's too much of it; there should just be a nice history essay explaining it (maybe by character Jack Ryan).<br />Supposed spies do not discuss their mission in unsecured areas, like discussing a 'hit' while walking down the street.<br />And there is an excess of coincidence.  You get one per book and that got used up halfway through this book.  Beyond that it is hard to sustain belief.<br />Did he really write this?	2003-09-04

The setting, the SCA's Pennsic War, is interesting for outsiders, but note below.<br />There are problems with this book.  People don't talk like this, the only explanation is that they are saying it for our benefit, but we (the readers) aren't supposed to be there.<br />This doesn't work as any genre I can think of.  It isn't a police procedural, inspite of a police officer as a main character, because the procedure is wrong.  It isn't a good mystery because it handles clues and red herrings poorly (Agatha Christie would throw the author out for some of the blatant red herrings, they are too bluntly used and too unbelievable).<br />I showed it to two former SCA members who have read the first chapter so far:  One (a writer) pointed out serious point of view problems.  Quote: &quot;the author obviously never took a writing class&quot;.  That could mean it's fresh and new, but in this case it is not intended as a compliment, the author blew basic writing skills.<br />The other former SCA member's comment was that there were 3 major (to an SCA member) errors of fact (just in chapter 1).  So while you may find out something about the SCA, it may not be accurate.<br />Much of the last third of the book consists of one character interviewing other characters (boring).  There is one of those trite mystery story denouments where the detective accuses people until the guilty party foolishly confesses.<br />I think it's actually 1 star writing but I gave it an extra for an interesting setting.	2003-09-04

Possibly my expectactions were inappropriate, from the cover blurb I expect the hero to be a man suicidal with survivor's guilt who would be recklessly successful in his search for an honorable way to throw his life away.  I was hoping for some deep soul searching and psychological insight.<br />Instead I got a basic story about someone becoming a hero against long odds because of great internal resourcfulness.  Nothing wrong with that, it's often done, but it's often done. So it seems a little flat.  There's some interesting insight into the nature of free will and psychology courtesy of the geas, but that was the main differentness of this book.<br />To me it was just same old-same old.	2003-05-10

If you can get past the terrible editing in chapter 1 it might be an OK reprint of articles on software engineering.<br />Chapter 1 was very frustrating because of the blatant bad editing.  If they were errors in content then they might be due to my misunderstanding, but these are blatant errors and are definitely the fault of bad proofreading/editing.  Example: When someone enumerates 4 points as (1),(2),(2) and (4) it is not my imagination.<br />Chapter 1 is intended for a software engineering manager.  Chapter 2 is the obvious part of engineering ethics, concluding with a reprint of the IEEE code of ethics.  Chapter 3 defines the system engineering level, at length.  Chapter 4 is the importance of requirements engineering.  Chapter 5 is Software design, 6 is overviews of development strategies, 7 is coding and unit testing, Chapter 8 is testing and integration, 9 is on maintenance.<br />Most of the articles are reprints of previously published articles (I even recognize the badly reprinted werewolf pictures from \\"No Silver Bullet\\" in Chapter 2 that were previously printed in an IEEE magazine I used to have).<br />Production values are unacceptable!  The digital, on demand printing method used results in inferior print quality.  Some pages look like they were running a little low on ink, some seem to have a little too much ink, some graphics with thin lines have breaks in them due to rasterization.  Some gray scale to hatching results in a cheap appearance.  Did I make it clear enough that Chapter 1 has blatant editing errors that make me distrust the content?<br />Given the above problems it is also overpriced in my opinion.<br />This refers to 2nd edition.<br />OK, this was published by the IEEE.  We're Engineers, I don't expect us to be best-selling writers; I do expect us to be able to hire a proofreader and a printer.	2003-04-19

The art is excellent and the story good but I rated it only 4 stars because the combination of issues in this volume don't quite hang together.<br />#21 is the defeat of the demon queen left over from the previous TPB, which has some repercussions covered in 22-23, 24 involves a fight with a very powerful Ingra.  #25 and 26 are the beginning of an arc where main protagonist, Giselle, must prove herself to the 7 guilds and truly learn her craft.  This is a great seperate arc which will unfortunately now be split between 2 TPBs (this one and the successor).  I really like the arc that begins in #25 and should continue through #31 (7 issues, one for each guild, or style of magic); this arc is going to be a really well done and I'm looking forward to it.<br />The art is excellent (the beautiful women are beautiful, the monsters are monstrous).  Good productions values - the colors are really vibrant.  Good story except for the arc problem described above.  A fun read.  I bought this TPB even though I own the original comics for the convenience of having them bound together.	2003-04-19

It can be confusing with it's bad cohesion and tendancy to wander off track.<br />I knew I was in trouble on page one when I couldn't figure out what year it was talking about.  Paragraph one talks about the great news of the the 13th amendment ending slavery in 1865. Paragraph 2 and 3 talk about Dr. Carver being born in 1860 or '61, but it isn't clear that the narration has jump anti-chronologically here.<br />I don't know what the target age is for this book.  I think a High School Freshman could handle most of it.  But I had to go to a dictionary to look up the word self-abnegation.<br />My advice?

While it's important to remember the horror of war that is for a different book, even if the horrors are displayed in the form of personal recollections.  I accept the set up where the nature of the soldiers in this special unit was explained, but towards the end it really dragged as it carried on long after the end of the units active participation in the war.<br />Needed more focus on the use and effectiveness of deception at war and less on inidividual's recollections of unrelated events.	2002-09-20

Building the examples is of little value because they've already been done.  Building your own dreams with ideas from the book is the point.<br />The book is expensive,... for the size.

There are too many characters packed in, and a lot of times I'm left wondering &quot;why are they in there?&quot; The part about Faith in prison is interesting, but it seems to me she was added to the plot just so they could use those scenes. Willow dies on one page (relax, she's a major character, we know they'll bring her back, just after a lot of work) forget the lot of work: the next thing we know she's just up and now the phone is dead. (Looks like they cut something there and forgot to clean up). <br />The back cover says that the door is closed when one of the people they are trying to rescue is klilled: doesn't happen. There's supposed to be some temptation about finding a pleasant alternity - tacked on in one paragraph, not really there. <br />Spike get's in, but doesn't go anywhere. Other characters have cameos. Needs fewer cameos and more continuity.<br />If you are a big time Buffy or Angel fan, or if you've already read the preceding parts and just need an ending, then read it. Otherwise, give this one a pass.	2001-12-08

A supposed model of a mythic story that contains certain elements and has been replicated for centuries and across many societies because it is basic to humanity.<br />While the idea of extracting a universal pattern from great literature is intriguing the result is not necessarily useful. The book consists largely of a long laundry list of elements that may or may not be found in a particular story. Included are a large number of self serving references of the form 'as I said in my other book...' which I found irritating since I bought this book not another. <br />The author has attempted to support the idea of a great model by including an example based on using the techniques described. You would think that if you were writing a book on how to write, and demonstrating a great technique, that you would make sure your example was a wonderfully written piece. It isn't. The author's excuse it by adding at the end that it is 'Only a draft'. I'm unimpressed by the example and the technique.	2001-11-30

Roddy Doyle is a best selling author and thoroughly Irish, writing about the Irish.  When you look at the details that make up his characters there is something wonderful about them, little touchs that make them intricate and interesting.  But when you get to the end of the story you're back at the beginning: the characters have been through the story but they haven't gotten anywhere.<br />Perhaps this is the pessimistic Irish view.  Maybe Mr. Doyle really thinks things never change and that a work of literature should reflect that.  But I happen to think that at the end of a story the characters should have changed or been changed.<br />The plot of all three novels can be summarized as: things happen and then the rug gets pulled out from under the characters.  And Mr. Doyle is so inventive in how he pulls the rug out!  I just wish he'd find something else to do.<br />I found _The Van_ to be my favorite.  There something of the classic tragic-comedy.  Like all classic tragedies the failure is inherent in the characters.  But unlike classic tragedy the characters who have the fatal flaw are normal people riddled with other flaws.  And there is something almost funny (the comedic part) about the classic rules of tragedy applied to characters who do not fit the classic discription of the tragic hero.  But at the end the characters are still just who, and where, they were when they started; and that depresses me.	2001-10-17

Rather it is the first quarter and the remainder of the novel will be serialized in the up coming books.  About the time this book gets to the really exciting part it stops and you have to wait for the next book (and it's a long pause waiting for the next book, it wasn't out yet when I read this one).<br />It's hard to evaluate a novel when all you have is the beginning.  As I was reading it I thought the characters were a little flat and the pacing a little slow, but I thought I was coming up on the end of the story, not just the end of the first piece.	2001-09-10

It isn't until you feel tension in unused chest muscles or your calves start to tense after what looks like trivial exercises that you realize that this is a significant exercise program even at the beginning and that the advice about starting easy is important.<br />Easy to do, fast, simple, no equipment, scalable (gets harder as you do).

A fantastic machine, yes, but still just a machine.  And the people who surround the machine are merely props in the story.<br />I found the recounting of the engineering challenges interesting, but I'm an engineer.  Rarely is engineering portrayed as an adventure.  The recounts of the management challenges would probably be educational to someone in management.  The author was head of design and then head of test.  The actual flying of the LM occurred at a great distance.  For a history of technical difficulties and solutions this is a good example.<br />Warning:  There is something about the font used to print the copy I have that I do not like.

In this book he gives practical advice on improving the efficiency (optimizing) and the limits there of.  While showing how to trade off speed for space or vice-versa, he points out the limits that can be expected to gain.  His list of techniques is a collection of practical approaches rather than theoretical possibilities.<br />At 158 pages (not counting index) this book is eminently readable, accessable and useful.  Clearly written and well organized this is a book to keep on your shelf for when a program needs improving.  It is also a book to read before a program as a reminder not to make things complicated with optimization that aren't needed.	2001-08-08

This is contrary to the normal method which would give general rules for optimizing, possibly with examples of specific techniques and let the reader find the uses.  This book really consists of about six specific techniques which are good if they are applicable to your project but otherwise too narrow.  Most of the space is one long technique (in excruciating detail) that Mr. Heller is particularly proud of.<br />Steve Heller is noted for a clear and simple style (but be aware that one of ways he attains that is by belaboring simple points).  His section pointing out the importance of measurement to optimizing (necessary to validate that an optimization that should speed up a program actually does result in improvement, rather than unexpectedly causing the reverse) is excellent and crucial.<br />This is not an advanced book on optimization and is firmly grounded in a few specific techniques.  This book can be of use to practical beginners but is of less value to experienced programmers.	2001-08-06

The latter is nonsense. It may work for a college course where a skilled instructor is adding material but it is far too cursory to apply. The first 6 chapters are basic material for any curriculum on programming. The chapters that follow mention difficulties but give no techniques that can be applied. Nothing in this would enable a person, previous unprepared to do so, to write a real time system.<br />This book says it eschews mathematical formalism for practical utility. What it lacks is both a formal foundation and practical utility. The exercises (completely without sample answers) are terribly thought out. The description of difficulties of real time job scheduling are a list of known problems and some references to other papers. Sample code included is too specific to be general, and too general to be directly applicable.	2001-07-31

But most of the story is about trying to avoid German patrols.  It isn't an exciting adventure, it's more like a story about a game of hide and seek than a war story or history.<br />This book is highly focused on one operation without reference to anything else in the war.  There's nothing telling if something significant was learned by debriefing the general.  What we do learn about is the author's view of the residents of Crete (but we can't be sure whether it's accurate or prejudiced).<br />It's reasonably well written but not engrossing.	2001-07-29

This book documents the middle of the MIR/NASA joint program. Lots of detail. Highly critical of NASA politics and management.  The author has interviewed many of the people involved and gained access to a great many documents.  The non-chronological ordering makes the reading unnecessarily difficult.<br />The picture provided is of a joint venture that was primarily politically motivated with scientific research, and even crew, as after thoughts.  It is implied that NASA learned little from the experience because they weren't watching closely.  Which is too bad if true because what can be learned is the importance of attention to minute detail and extensive planning.<br />The dramatic discription of the various accidents on MIR makes exciting reading.  The view given of political manipulation in NASA's management and the bitter and acrimonious personal conflicts are disturbing (but interesting to read).<br />The insight into political chicanery in NASA management is alarming for the space program if accurately portrayed.	2001-07-25

The author opens by claiming to have grown up in the most corrupt city in America.  The politicians were corrupt.  The police were corrupt.  The bosses were corrupt.  The workers were corrupt.  Everyone was corrupt.  Apparently it's some kind of excuse for being corrupt if everyone else is too.  Others dispute the characterization of Jersey City as flagrantly corrupt (but I notice no one is jumping to the defense of the politicians).<br />After the history of how the environment corrupts everyone is the part where the author claims to be almost the only one not infected.  Actually the part about fighting toxic chromium pollution and coverups might make an interesting book, but there isn't that much about it here.  Then there's the running away from her roots part.  Then the coming near home but not quite back home part.  Finally there's the ethical summing up part about how we're shaped by our environment part, but by then I just wanted the book to end and be over because I was bored.<br />I'm not sure there's a point to this book anywhere in it.  I've noticed most biographies have a sort of theme of this is a paradigm so live this way (or occasionally, learn from and avoid this way).  I just didn't feel that here.  All this has is some unpleasant anecdotes about growing up in tough situations.	2001-07-14

More generally a person writing implementations for multi-processors could learn something. The measurements of how to estimate and minimize cost of interprocess communications could be singnificant.<br />However, it is of little use to a person concerned with optimizing SQL queries for general implementations (much of Hasan's work was at very low level, such as bypassing SQL's built in optimizing and at the implementation level below that normally available to SQL users).<br />So if you need the specific area of interest then it's excellent but otherwise it's too limited in scope.	2001-06-17

At least we're told he's twelve, I'd have forgotten if we weren't reminded because there is nothing in the writing to give the feel of youth.<br />Instead of a classic battle between modern human technology and ancient faery magic we have faeries with even more advanced technology (but with magic too to make them so powerful we're supposed to forgive the villain his villainy).<br />The villain is villainous but not interesting.  The faeries aren't faery like (they've got a centaur for a Mr. Scott, but without the brogue).	2001-05-09

This is the definitive answer to what happened on Apollo 13.  The result, in readable form, of NASA's investigation and review of the entire flight.<br />Detailed analysis of what chain of little mistakes culminated in the explosion.  Details of the recovery plan.  And even some insight into the astronauts like part of the debriefing where they tell what they thought of the razors supplied by NASA.<br />Technical details and analysis into an exciting episode of the manned space program.	2001-04-20

After listing a topic there is no depth showing how it relates to other topics, impacts our life, is useful or beautiful.<br />After showing a topic of mathematics I'm left wonder why I might conceivably care.	2001-03-17

And here we get a glimpse of the personalities and politics that really allowed a man to walk on the moon and return.	2001-03-17

If you are involved in any field in which plans are made and then implemented, be they in any of the engineering disciplines or in any field of human activity, then there is something to be learned from this book.<br />But the writing is such that you will have to expend energy to extract the message from the text.  The author apparently wanted to show off his vocabulary and 'erudition', so it is not an easy read.<br />Educational but not suited for light or relaxed reading.	2001-01-14

While the first volume was both wonderful fiction and good advice on managing people, the latest fell flat.<br />The structure of the book is lacking.  The taut tension absent.  The humor banal.  And the insight into human nature to be expected by this writer gone.<br />Regrettably not worth keeping now that I have it.	2000-12-05

Absolutely engrossing insight into what really happened in the secret reachs of spy (cryptographers at least) work during WWII.	2000-11-10

The chapter on what not to order at a restaurant alone is worth the price of the book.<br />To bad there isn't a glossary for those of us who don't speak fluent food and french.<br />A lot  of fun.	2000-06-06

Unfortunately, although Hamilton has aquired Harvic's interesting  character Miss Seeton, he has lost a good deal of the former's charm.   Carvic's books had an amazing way of having logical actions result in  illogicaland  humorous consequences. I find Hamilton starting from  illogical actions AND situations.  I much prefer the original work by  Carvic.	1998-08-23
