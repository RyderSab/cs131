Playful, colorfull illustrations complement a well-paced text (this is a great read-aloud) that delivers a history of the first girl's professional baseball league (see the movie A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN).  <BR>Corey's author's note makes this picture book that much more valuable and will allow elementary school teachers to more readily use it with upper grades.<BR>I read it to my 22 6th graders and they loved it!!!  The amazing fact that the first line of \\"Take Me Out To The Ball Game\\" includes the name of a GIRL will surely amaze all readers.  <BR>Corey's knack for effectively and poetically crafting text in a picture book is something that older (and younger) elementary-aged students can study for their own ventures into writing.  <BR>She provides excellent models (with these historical fiction picture books) for taking history and reshaping it with a fictional slant while preserving the integrity of the historical events.<BR>Wow!!!  Buy it and read it to a kid!!!!!	2003-02-27

Jerry Spinelli's books should not be limited to young adult/children's.  Stargirl, like others, is a wonderful story for ages far above teens. Spinelli is a master at drawing you into a story with vivid, real, and impressive characters.  Then he proceeds to develop them through fascinating interrelationships with other characters, real dialogue, and masterfully magnifying them with his settings.   The rich details of Arizona that Spinelli describes help to magnify Stargirl and Starboy.  From a saguaro to a moa, these details are not there by accident.  Anyone who wants to learn the craft of writing from a master ought to pick Spinelli.  Stargirl is perfect and wonderful and inspiring and thought-provoking and will get inside of your heart and grow.  I plan to reread it again and again.   Buy it for a  friend today!!	2000-12-11
