It is a great little book for making your own Valentine cards but it has nothing to do with Mary-Kate and Ashley. I thought there would pictures of them on the cards themselves and a little saying that has to do with Valentine and/or twins. Its great but it kind of leaves the twins out of the book except the cover. It comes with great art materials. If it had the twins in it more than this would be worth 5 stars.	2001-12-26
