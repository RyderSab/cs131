It's also about Adam's idea to get his moms llamas to the towns library remodel celebration.  The focus seemed to much on  Adams feelings for a girl and not enough about the llamas in the title.  I  felt that it's not appropriate for kids in the 4th grade and under, but to  young for older kids.  The title will attract kids to read it, but once I  read the book I felt it was deceiving. It contains black and white  illustrations, and would be 5th grade level reading.	2000-01-12

I didn't care for narrative as much - choppy, preschoolish sounding.  Keeps you standing on the outside watching, rather than becoming part of the story.

This book was about rushing to judgement based on looks, and intolerance for someone who is different.  It reminds me of what came out of Columbine.  Bran is different and people don't want to accept him.  Then they find out  an awful truth about his father and in a rush to judgement decide he must  be just like his father.  This one I recommend to students from the 7th  grade level up, as well as all teachers and parents.	2000-01-11
