US	53001689	R1BW0WLE3KMR6L	1400062659	627904149	The Orientalist: Solving the Mystery of a Strange and Dangerous Life	Books	5	8	9	N	Y	...I liked it anyway	The Orientalist takes the reader through some of the great upheavals of the last 150 years, including the demise of the Russian Empire Bolshevik Revolution, the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, both World Wars, the fate of the Russian Emigrees, the upheaval in Germany that led to the rise of Adolf Hitler.  Reiss looks at these events through the eyes of young Lev Nussimbaum, and the story is remarkably fresh with a unique point of view.  There are many side adventures in the Orientalist which I found fascinating and informative (the German enclave in Azerbaijan; the \\"Mountain Jews\\" of Azerbaijan, the society of Constantinople in the final days of the empire).  All fascinating and fun reading. <br /> <br />But I had to let the fun of reading this type of book override the frustration I felt from the almost total absence of any source reference.  Basically, the author is saying \\"trust me, the story I am weaving is not completely made up.\\"  And if it had not been for the fact that it is very well written and that the numerous subjects in the book are fascinating, I could not have stood it.  At one point on P.186, there is a lengthy passage by D.H. Lawrence, but no attempt to advise the hapless reader where it came from.  There are numerous references to individuals without assigning a name to them (the driver of the car responsible for the murder of Rathenau).  There is an abundance of footnotes throughout the book, but the footnotes are equally free of any source reference or citation.  I was not sure why they were there instead of in the main body of the text. <br /> <br />You might get the idea that I did not enjoy reading the Orientalist, or that I would not recommend it.  But you would be wrong.  I am just grumbling about the nature of this kind of writing, and it is a big risk for the author.  It is more essay than anything else.  There are other books out there like it, but not many.  It is a distinctly journalistic style of telling a story, but it requires a great deal of faith from the reader.  One such book is \\"The Africans\\" by David Lamb, also a journalist, written as a story, without facts to clutter things up.  I liked that book too. <br /> <br /> <br />Another aspect of the book which I found frought with peril was the political one.  The book is told from the perspective of the wealthy son of an Azeri oil magnate who longs for the days of Empire.  The Bolshevik revolution is exploding around him as he and his father escape to Georgia, Constantinople, Paris, Berlin.  The Bolsheviks are portrayed as mirror images of the Nazis, as the model used by Hitler for the entire Nazi movement.  Many volumes have been devoted to this subject and will be in the future.  I though it was one of the weaknesses of the book and too important a subject to be left as one of the side stories.  Were the Communists the same as the Nazis?  Did they really have the same agenda or point of origin?  Was one the originator of the other?  Did they both represent the same kind of evil?  Was Stalin the same as Hitler?  Was he worse?  I found it unfortunate that the book answered these questions in the affirmative without reservation.  For me, the answers to these big questions deserve their own library. <br /> <br />That's all.  I still liked the book enough to give it 5 stars.  Go read it and decide for yourself.	2005-10-11

It is a blend of richly beautiful photogrophy with insightful and haunting narrative.  The trees themselves come alive, sometimes as dieties.  The stories behind these particular trees left me with a sense of affection for these remarkable beings. <br /> <br />I remember reading a review and wondering what the fuss was all about.  But there is much to fuss about.  I know we are not to comment on other reviewers, but I must break the rules here.  The reviews of this book are by far the most eloquent and beautiful I have come across.  Usually there is some crank in the bunch who has awful things to say about a really good book.  Not so here.  It is as thought the sublime spiritual nature of the subject and the presentation brought out the best in everyone.	2005-10-03

I was not planning on sumbitting a review of this book until I read with alarm the undeserved slammings from the majority of the other reviewers.  I was genuinely stunned to find the overwhelmingly negative response, or, at best, lukewarm reactions or damning with faint praise.  This is especially true since my own experience of Headlong was extremely positive.  I found the story to be engaging and funny and also well written.  I found the characters believable and fully formed and did not mind at all the sidebar lecture on the Dutch Masters.  In short, I LIKED it from start to finish, and found it to be one of the most entertaining novels I had read in a long time.    Considering the garbage that is being fobbed off on the unsuspecting public in the past few years, Headlong seemed like a breath of fresh air.  I mean, there are some books that make it to the best seller list that make me wonder if the lost art of book-burning should be revived.  But this was not one of them.  Why not save the one-star reviews for books like the Historian and its idiotic and overpaid ilk?	2005-09-24

Set in the early Sixth century (can you name one thing that happened in the Sixth Century?) with the cataclysmic eruption of Krakatoa, blotting out the sun for nearly two years.  The effects on the entire world were profound, since nothing was able to grow.  Like other books by Yarbro, I feel as though I had slipped through a small window into this world and could experience what was actually happening.  Also, this was historically I period I had no knowledge of whatsoever, which added to the mysterious quality of the novel.<br /><br />For me, the St. Germain series has always been a guilty pleasure, with an emphasis on the pleasure.  There is something slightly old fashioned about the writing, but not stilted.  It is true that much of the book is dialogue between St. Germain and his (eternal) companion.  But I did not find that to be a problem.  All in all, Dar of the Sun is a far better book than some of the other \\"historical\\" novels coming off the factory lines recently (you know what I mean).	2005-09-21

I might as well have been reading the unabridged history of the Byzantine Empire, or even Moby Dick!  And no one was more sorry than me, after all the good things I heard and read about this masterpiece.  Maybe if it hadn't been hyped so much... or maybe if it wasn't so self conscious... or maybe if I never heard of it...  The fact that I could not even finish a this short novel says it all, I think.

This book is far and away one of the most comprehensive and intriguing descriptions of downtown Manhattan that has ever been put together.  It is a complete mystery to me why there has never been a reissue of As You Pass By, even without the color (Courrier & Ives) plates.  It would sell like hotcakes.  I am constantly referring back to it.  And since it was published originally in 1952, there has been considerable change in the \\"modern\\" city. <br /> <br />If you know someone with even a fleeting interest in early New York (a fanatical crew), you have come upon the perfect gift for that individual.  But if you do give it as a gift, do not expect much conversation from the receipient for a considerable length of time.	2005-08-26

But the rest is a sheer delight for the eyes and compiles enough information to make it more than just a collection of pictures.

Nearly impossible to penetrate and with little credible information getting out (except for high level intelligence), Bradley Martin tells an amazing story of a very important and dangerous place.  To make things worse for a serious investigative writer, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il have created a high octane, no holds barred cult of personality for both father and son which make it extremely difficult to separate out the real story.  He deserves a creat deal of credit for this undertaking and it is far and away the best and most informative work on the DPRK to be found in English. <br /> <br />What I also admired about this book was Martin's restraint and his willingness to portray the actual facts, including positive ones.  Granted, there is not a great deal of good news coming out of Pyongyang in the last few decades.  And it would be tempting to paint both Kims as evil incarnate.  Indeed, our own government has presented a two-dimensional cartoon like vision of a planetary bad guy.  More of such counter-mythology is not helpful in understanding this complex and dangerous society.  I was amazed at the amount of information Martin was able to pull together and the complex portrait he was able to present. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the people who could most benefit from reading this book will probably never go near it.  One aspect of the book I appreciated was the comparison between today's ultra-marxist state and the early Choson dynasty which governed Korea for nearly 600 year until the Japanese invasion in the 1890s.  North Korea has almost completely replicated the Ancient \\"Hermit Kingdom\\" that remained closed to outsiders for centuries.  The Kims have replicated the nepotism that so dominated ancient Korea, along with the vast array of palaces and the complete deification of the leadership by the peasantry. <br /> <br />I highly recommend Mr. Martin's book.  And like it or not, North Korea is in our future.	2005-08-19

Not just the length but also the subject matter:  magicians in England.  How could that be anything other than done to death?  Much later, I actually started reading the book and was very surprised by what I found.    First of all, the writing style is amazing.  The novel has a sense of being effortless in the writing.  This, I have learned from my own unfortunate experiences, is very hard to do.  I have a sense from the narrative that it was more discovered in its completed form than painstakingly crafted.  This is the rare mark of a great writer.  The author's style is clear and crisp and because of this, the pace of the novel is brisk and the pages fly by.    Second, the characters came alive quickly after being introduced.  I found them all to be fully fleshed out and believable and I have a strong mental image of what each one looks like.  I cared about them also, as the author infused each with a degree of humanity and complexity that made me want to explore further as they grew into the story.    I'm afraid I don't have much in the way of negative criticism, other than the footnotes, which I realize were there for some comic effect (as was much of the novel).  But I have always had an attention span problem with footnotes, and they are also harder for me to read so I had to hike the heavy volume on a different angle so my bleary eyes could focus.  Quite hard on the thumbs, actually.    Finally, I was in awe of the satirical aspect of the novel.  The portrayal of London society in the 1810s was hysterical.  For me, the novel was very much of a social commentary, but not in the style of Dickens (as many have compared it to because, I think, of the size).  I thought it had qualities of Dickens, especially with some of the more fantastic passages.  But the insightful dialogue and portrayals of social interactions of the  characters reminded me more of Jane Austen.  I have always found something cartoon-like about Dickens (sorry!), which is exactly what I did not find in this novel.  Instead, the characters here seemed engaged in highly probable conversations, have highly probable human reactions.      Do yourself a favor, have a look.  As a converted skeptic, I think you will be pleased.  And soon you can get the hopefully lighter version in paperback!	2005-07-27
US	53001689	RIZIQBFA4OWW9	0316011770	454028739	The Historian	Books	2	17	21	N	Y	A Mediocre Slog	Like many other reviewers, I read the positive anticipatory reviews of the Historian, comparing it to other recent historical best sellers, the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" for one, promising better writing, more substance, more accurate and engaging history.  What a mistake!<br /><br />The writing is plodding and dull.  There is no other way to describe it.  Cliche-filled, travel-brochure descriptions of some of the most fascinating cities in the world.  I did not feel like I was there, in fact I did not feel like the characters were there either.  Several times while reading this far too long comic book, I felt as if I was watching a bad remake of \\"Mask of Dimitrios\\" replete with Peter Lorre, Sidney Greenstreet and Colonel Haki type characters who utter the most ludicrous dialogue.  There was also way to much hair standing up all over these characters' various body parts for my taste:  neck, back, head, you name it.  Ditto with eyes bulging out in surprise, gasping, uttering \\"Good God, Man!\\" and other such substitutes for emotions I was NOT feeling.  Gadzooks!<br /><br />Having just completed a round trip flight to Asia, I thought this would be the perfect companion, the enormous bulk notwithstanding.  But alas, watching the Aleutian Islands slowly glide by was more of an attention getter.  And am I the only one who kept wondering if the main character (whose name is frustratingly hidden from view) does not have very many \\"male\\" characteristics?  Is this an instance of a female author who wants to imbue the main character with a sensitive and not stereopyped side, or one who simply can't create a credible male character.  Come on, Kostova, let's inject a little testosterone into this dead fish.  I mean, the guy is bouncing all over the Balkans with this gal, what's the problem?  He does more gasping than a beached flounder.  Please let him exhale!  Then there are the lesser characters, such as the indomitable and all knowing Aunt Eva, the ingratiating Turgut, the sad clown Hugh James, Helen's pitiful mother, the room full of hapless professors not one of whom is even faintly skeptical of the insane speech fobbed off as a scholarly effort, and on and on.  Wwas this a conference of third-grade homeroom teachers?  Give me a break.<br /><br />To be fair, there were some moments I felt engaged in attempt to track down the elusive history surrounding You-Know-Who.  Some of the details of the Ottoman incursions into Europe were intriguing.  But there was too much pouring over ancient dusty documents and ancient dusty libraries, which someone miraculously recalled having seen just the right piece to this part of the puzzle, then spoon fed to the imbecilic audience.  Mostly, I am annoyed at all the hype this mediocre slog through medieval Wallachia has received.  It is not a good book, surely not worthy of the praise heaped on it by the reviewers.  Formulaic romance novels with the pink covers, aisle 22.	2005-07-20

This is not a scientific treatise or a technical analysis of the subjects raised in the book.  Instead, it is a moral tale, not unlike a sermon, and it does not pretend to be something other than that.  I found it to be extremely engaging, frightening too.  Why not?  Not everyone will agree with the points made by Bill McKibben, which is fine.  But he deserves much credit for presenting cogently a looming possibility for humanity and discussing it honestly and with foresight.  I was fascinated. <br /> <br />Is is \\"luddite\\" (if anyone really knows the meaning of that word) to question what the outcome might be of letting the genie out of the bottle?  Is it alarmist to suggest that we might need to reconsider the consequences of progress?  For most Americans, it seems almost sacriligious to question the infallibility of technology, to say nothing of its ability to constantly improve our lives.  But is that necessarily so?  Can anyone really say that unleashing the power of the Atom was unequivocally good?  Do we really have better lives with nuclear weapons blossoming all over the planet like morning glories?  For me, the answer is no, and I applaud the attempt by Bill McKibbon to state his case.  Is he absolutely correct, maybe not.  Only time will tell.  But this is an important book because it poses questions and challenges our thinking on the subject of genertic engineering, nanotechnology and the kind of future we are heading toward.  The intensity of the reviews is a testament to that.   <br /> <br />There are only a few voices out there discussing the possibilities awaiting us down the road.  Enough is well worth reading, it may shake you up, and it will provoke some much needed discussion on these subjects.   <br />	2005-03-15
US	53001689	R7JFQJP3KMOLD	0684849275	203897764	Grant	Books	5	119	128	N	N	Superb	This biography of Ulysses S. Grant is a fine book indeed and I highly recommed it for a number of reasons.  First, it is an enjoyable and easy book to read.  For most of the biography, Jean Edward Smith was able to forge a story that was both appealing and novel-like in its ability to engage.  I was surprised by this, as I have found that one of the most difficult tasks for any writer is to describe adequately a battle scene.  This is a trap where many writers succumb, but Smith was able to deftly balance giving the reader quantities of facts while at the same time keeping the reader interested.  I believe \\"Grant\\" could have easily been two or three times longer, giving greater detail about any number of aspects of the Civil War, Reconstruction, or the vagaries of the Grant Administration.  But it is my opinion that to do so would have been to sacrifice one of the most engaging and masterful aspects of this biography, which is the novel like quality of the work. <br /> <br />Second, felt that the subject matter was presented in a refreshing and exciting way, assessing Grants life and achievements with a different lens.  I remember long ago reading the McFeely biography and coming away wondering how Grant could have possibly become a general, a president, or much of anything.  The Grant of this earlier biography was practically a nonentity, depressed, alcoholic, bad at just about everything except killing great quantities of Confederates.  Smith has painted a portrait of a much greater man.  I believe this book would have won the Pulitzer Prize had it been written before McFeely's (which did win the Pulitzer).  But I think two Grant Pulitzers would have been unlikely. <br /> <br />If anything, \\"Grant\\" may tend to gush a little too much about its subject.  Smith lets Grant off the hook a number of times, especially with regard to his White House years.  Grant exhibited spectacularly bad judgment on a number of issues, not the least of which was his penchant for accepting gifts from wealthy con men.  On the other hand, it was Grant who almost single handedly won the Civil War.  I guess he's entitled to a little extra slack for that one.	2005-03-01

I believe it is the first time any of his poetry has been transalted for a single volume.  So it is a great thing that such a literary light as Lezama should finally appear in English.  But did we have to wait so long.<br /><br />The poems are magnificent and lyrical, dense just as his other writing is, like creeping along in an imaginary jungle.  I was also very pleasantly surprised to see the essay by Julio Cortazar, the Argentinian writer, himself a bright star.  It appeared in the 1970s in a book entitled \\"Around the day in 80 Worlds\\" which translated into English but quickly vanished.  It was a rare treat to see it included in the volume.<br /><br />If you are even remotely interested in the materpieces that have come out of Latin America in the last generation, please have a look a Lezama Lima.

It is very hard to put down and Boyle brings the reader into the front row of the action.    But this book is also a distressing and honest look at American society in the 1920s and the rampant racism infecting northern cities for the first time, as blacks began to migrate north.  None of the other reviewers even mention this aspect of the book and I think it the most powerful.  This is not merely a crime drama, although it is that too.  It is a vivid depiction of the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in the north, the mob rule that spread like wildfire through Detroit, Gary, Washington, Springfield, Tulsa, and many other cities, and the terror that was inflicted daily on people who had allegedly been set free 60 years earlier.  I do not know  much about the history of black America during the 1920s, and it was a series of horrifying revelations.  I am surprised that none of the reviewers has come away from reading this book with the same sense of dreary remorse as I felt.	2005-01-28

I'm no poetry \\"expert,\\" though I do know what I like, and I like this guy.  But where is everybody?  I thought this volume, as well as others in the American Poets Project, would have received more attention.  Especially William Carlos Williams, a voice like no other, intoxicating in a way that Whitman is, but a more modern voice, more syncopated.  And there is the same love of the world around him, mostly simple, sometimes broken things.  No doubt, he is one of the main voices of the 20th century and he well deserves his place in the pantheon. <br /> <br />If you have never read W.C. Williams, this is a great place to start.

You are right there in the blood and mud and nightmare with the soldier who wrote this book.  He writes straight from his gut in a way most writers cannot accomplish after a lifetime of writing.  This is not for the squeamish or romantic.  It is war at its most brutal and it is very up close.<br /><br />I came away from this book profoundly moved by the willingness of the author to tell his story in such a plain, unvarnished way and for his sacrifice and for all the soldiers who were not able to speak.  Historically, it is a fasinating look at the ground war in the Pacific, fought by the Marines.  Sledge deals in the day to day life of the soldier on the ground, how he had to fight, what kind of rifle he had, what his foxhole felt like, what it sounded like at night.  The devil's in these details.  We don't hear much about Peleliu any more (can you find it on a map without checking with encarta?)  We don't even hear much about the battle of Okinawa.  The European theater has gotten much of the attention lately.  I don't know why that is, maybe because it's easier to imagine Belgium or France, rather than Guadalcanal or the Solomon Islands.<br /><br />If you have a relative who served in any war, if your father or grandfather was in WW II, read this book for them, and think about what they did.	2005-01-25

This is a review of Labyrinth, by Taylor Branch.  I guess the wires somewhere got switched around.  Sorry folks... <br /> <br />In any event, Labyrinth is the story of the assassination in Washington, DC, of Orlando Letelier by agents of the Chilean Government.  It took place in the mid seventies in broad daylight by car bomb.  This is a fascinating piece of writing, made all the more harrowing by the fact that it is true.  The cast of characters includes the radical anti-Castro Omega 9, the Chilean secret police, known as Dina, the CIA, and the head of the DINA, Manual Contreras.   <br /> <br />Labyrinth is one of the most rivetting books I have ever read.  It may be hard to find, but it is well worth the effort.  I was up very late with this one.  Do yourself a favor.	2005-01-24
US	53001689	R3UO8P0XG6CTWK	0143034812	803586072	The Cross and The Crescent: The Dramatic Story of the Earliest Encounters Between Christians and Muslims	Books	5	10	12	N	N	Informative, Well Written, Insightful	I became with Richard Fletcher's book as a result of a very favorable book review, and quickly realized why the review was so positive.  When I finally located it, I was surprised how small it was.  Nevertheless, Fletcher presents a concise and highly readable analysis of Islamic-Christian relations since the founding of Islam. <br /> <br />One aspect of the book I found especially fasinating was the relationship between \\"Eastern\\" christian churches and the Roman Catholic Church.  Often, the Eastern churches (i.e., Armenian, Coptic, Greek Orthodox, Syrian, to name a few) were treated with as much suspicion by the west as Islam.  Fletcher's discussion of the crusades was also fascinating. <br /> <br />To say that the subject of this book is timely and historically important is, of course, an understatement.  Probably most Americans would learn something important about our Islamic neighbors at this time of war, hatred, bloodshed and misunderstanding.  As we begin nation building in Iraq, or Iran or eslewhere in the middle east, as we watch the death toll mounting from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, we will need as much information as we can gather to promote peace.  This book is a great place to start.	2005-01-21

And that would be a mistake.  This novel is fundamentally about itself, making constant references to the writing of it, other writings, other authors, the process of writing, and other writings of this author.  I found the transitions out of context and jarring, as though I was being suddenly reminded that I was reading a book.    After a while, I found the de-constructing of Evita to be tiresome and not very original.  The subject of Evita Peron's life is an extremely colorful, bizarre and fascinating story in and of itself.  Somehow, I felt that the author had utilized this famous and powerful legend to manipulate the reader.  The segments of the narrative which are more \\"straight\\" and not self referential, are extremely compelling.  Then suddenly, I felt I had been caught in a mouse trap of deconstructionist trickery, and that Martinez had \\"used\\" his purported subject as a piece of cheese to lure me in.  Not nice.	2005-01-19

It is a wild, untamed, explosive piece of writing, hard to compare with anything else, as it springs from the soil of the northeast, where things are different.  This work is very much a creature of its environment.  I especially remember being transfixed by one of the characters, Diadorim, an amazing creation of the life force which Guimaraes brings to life with mercurial power.    When I was younger and had more brain cells, I read parts of the Spanish translation, never the original Portuguese.  Unfortunately, the English translation leaves a lot to be desired.  Even the title itslef \\"the Devil to pay\\" instead of \\"Hell to pay\\" is a big mistake. The rest is equally archaic and stiff, as though it had been translated by an aging high school english teacher.  The translator also fails to capture to local dialects or slang and opts instead for British sounding idioms.  Gadzooks!  And what a sadly missed opportunity.  The Spanish version captures some of the electricity of the original Brazilian-Portugueseas.    The translation is like looking at the Bayeux Tapestries from behind, a vague outline being all that is visible.  Still, it is better than nothing.  This work is a genuine masterpiece and is still a powerful and valuable experience.	2005-01-12

It is a mystery, but not exactly, its scope is larger.  I had a hard time breaking away the few times I did.  Some of the scenes are very wrenching, and the theme of the death of a child is portrayed with an emotional intensity that is sustained throughout the novel and which I felt weighing heavily.  I say this not as a criticism of the writing, but quite the opposite.  I would enthusiastically recommend this novel and I hope it receives the attention it deserves	2005-01-09

I saw one of her books and was attracted by the title, enough to open the cover and read more.  I was intrugued by the main character, le Comte de St. Germain, as he is sometimes known.  A mercurial figure indeed.  I was also familiar with a certain sect devoted to St. Germain who believe he has lived in many different eras.  This is not something Ms. Yarbro made up.  The books can be still found in \\"esoteric\\" book stores (as few as there are) and are usually green paperbacks with purple ink and the text is, well, boring.   <br /> <br />Not so Ms. Yarbro.  This novel, and I have not read very many, set in 17th Century Peru during the conquista, is alive and fresh.  The historical perspective she gives is fantastic and I feel myself transported back in time.  Yje characters are unique and develop well with the story, even the Conte de St. Germain, who even though endowed with some awesome supernatural powers, does not serve as an excute to cop out on the plot.  It was a satisfying experience for me.	2004-12-20

The Wind-Up Burd Chronicle was apparently much longer in the original Japanese version, and I wish the entire thing had been translated.    After several pages of this novel, I wondered why I was reading it.  I was not engaged and it seemed like the heavy book, paperback though it was, might fall from my hands.  But then something happened:  I entered Mr. Murakami's world and had a hard time comimg back out.  It is difficult (impossible) to categorize this novel.  Murakami can write about simple events in an intoxicating way.  It is too earthbound to be a fantasy, and yet it is a fantastic, surreal journey.  Some of the scenes in Mongolia during the war were among the best historical writing I have ever read.  And there are some very powerful erotic passages also.  Try fantasy, science fiction, mystery, add irony, add water and shake well.  There is also something very musical about the Wind-up Bird Chronicle.  Read it and you will probably agree with me.  It is very powerful and evocative work and I regretted that it came to an end.  Maybe I should learn Japanese...	2004-12-11

I was also surprised by some of the positive ones, seeking to make comparisons with other authors.  My question is: why?  Is it really important that a work remind us of Garcia Marquez or Carlos Fuentes or Juan Goytisolo or Ernest Hemingway or anyone else?  I think the Shadow of the Wind stands well by itself and does not need to be similar to anything else.  It is a unique double-story, folding in upon itself, with great characters and development.  To me, the Shadow of the Wind was very much alive.  I felt the ambience of the city and of the vivid characters, even as some of them seemed trapped in a dream.<br /><br />The reviews of the Spanish edition of the Shadow of the Wind are far more positive than for the English version.  This makes me wonder about the translation.  I believe it may not have been an easy novel to translate, and often some of the idiomatic dialogue sounded awkward and off the mark.  Let's not forget that Barcelona is a city in which Catalan is spoken.  From there to Spanish to English, I have no doubt some of the freshness may have been dissipated.  It's hard to translate.<br /><br />NOTE:  (added later)  who keeps pushing all those \\"unhelpful\\" buttons for ALL the positive reviews?  I hope you are having fun wasting your seeimingly abundant time with this idiotic behavior.  Please seek immediate professional help for your peculiar little complex.	2004-12-11

I was very moved by this biography, especially in the way in which de Kooning and his world come alive.  The writing contains enough analysis to help connect the dots of the artist's life.  And the book is rich in detail, especially about the art world in downtown New York from the 1930s on.  I enjoyed reading some of the detailed descriptions of various New York venues.    One thing that struck me was how uniformly negative most of the reviews of de Kooning were.  It seems as though he enjoyed a brief romance period with the critics early on, when his work was still entirely abstract.  That was in 1950, after his work \\"Excavation.\\"  After that, the critics basically wrote him off, declaring that he was past his prime.  There were, of course, some exceptions to this, including de Kooning himself.    It was also distressing to read in detail the gradual deterioration of the artist by alcohol and his destructive personal behavior.  This was the only aspect of the book I had difficulty with, as at times I felt like a peeping tom, peering in on the lurid goings on in the de Kooning household.  But I don't suppose there is any way to tell the story without telling that part of it.  It is no big secret that many great artists, performers, poets, writers, etc., have had more than their fair share of demons to contend with, and this biography illuminates that point vividly.        The biography is extremely well written and the pages fall away with novelistic abandon.  I did not feel weighed down by an over abundance of detail, but I also came away feeling very \\"satisfied\\" as a reader.  Please go ahead and treat yourself to a powerful experience.  I would strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in artistic expression, in the process of creative expression and where it comes from, in the craftmanship and hard work that goes into his art, and in a fascinating period in history.  The authors have captured a dynamic view into the soul of a master.	2004-12-10

It is a dense, jungle of images, language, against an elegant background.  I can not think of another work to compare Paradiso to, as it stands alone.  Once upon a time, I attempted to read it in Spanish, but was overcome by a tidal wave of intricate vocabulary.   <br /> <br />It is unfortunate Lezama Lima has been largely forgotton in the US except for a few ardent readers.  It is impossible to find any of his poems in translation.  Maybe they are not so readily translatable.  In any event, the translation of Paradiso is in itself an amazing achievement, as Paradiso explodes in volcanic beauty.	2004-12-10

Partly because of the cover, partly because the bookseller had turned it out on the shelf.  Partly because I had watched up close the terrible events of that terrible day.  But I was not disappointed by this taut and at times poetic tale of the condo dwellers, each with their peculiar fates.  The novel is not about 9/11, and it is not mawkish or sentimental.  Nor is there anything exploitive about the treatment of the World Trade Center tragedy.  Instead, I found it very life affirming.  The characters were vivid and powerful and easily formed themselves in my imagination. The writing is elegant and simple, and reading the book took no effort at all.  I wondered where Rinaldi had come up with the names of some (all?) of the characters, which sounded improbable to me and a little distracting.  But that's just me.  All in all, I would highly recommend this as a rewarding read.	2004-12-10

I was attracted to the book originally because my father was involved in the Japanese war crimes trials.  But my expectations were far exceeded by what I believe to be one of the finest books I have ever read.  Do yourself a favor.    I read the book in 2000, before the Iraq War, but think about it often lately. While the occupation of Japan was far different in many ways from the mess in Iraq, it is highly poignant to compare the differences between the two.  Dower's book forces a comparison between two occupations, with dreary conclusions to be made about Iraq.  It is tempting to imagine the generation of our fathers and grandfathers being allowed to rebuild Iraq in the same way Japan was rebuilt into the economic giant it is today.	2004-10-07
