I found out about this book when I heard Joe Meno on NPR. I was excited that there was a book about a punk rocker at Chicago's Brother Rice High School since I also graduated from Brother Rice and was a punk rocker, so I ordered it immediately. (Of course there are differences: the people in the book graduated around 1991 and I graduated in 1977.)    First of all, as some of the other reviewers point out, this book's setting, Chicago's Southwest side, seems to be one of the main characters in the book. I grew up there and for that reason reading the book was a nostalgic experience. It is fun reading a book set exclusively in places you've been. Also, Meno inserts a lot of music into the book, much of which I am familiar with, so that was enjoyable.    When I heard Joe's interview with Scott Simon my impression was that he was an articulate, intelligent, sensitive individual. When I began reading the book I wondered if that was the same guy - I was frustrated because the first person narrative was in a loose, conversational tone. It was like totally in the teen vernacular, I guess. Okay - that last sentence was an imitation of the style. At first it drove me crazy but eventually I realized he was using the language style to capture the world of his subjects similar to Jay McInerny's Story of My Life.      The main character and narrator, Brian Oswald, is pretty inconsistent. At times he seemed like a decent guy, at other times he seemed despicable. At times he was a wimp, at other times he was a tough guy. He runs a gamut from confused and disenfranchised to insightful and self-confident. This is a portrait of the typical teen-ager as a confused young punk rocker. (Actually Brian Oswald makes a gradual transformation in the book from a heavy metal dude to punk rocker.)    Another frustrating detail: after thirty-five chapters he starts again at chapter one, and one the main characters (Gretchen) is absent. Then twenty-three chapters later we get another chapter one,so the book seems to start three times.    I started to think, \\"What is this? Just a bunch of half finished junk from his notebooks?\\" But I also found myself thinking about the book and the characters while I wasn't reading it, and looking forward to reading it each night. In other words the book grew on me and I will tell you all that despite the books apparent sloppy style it is a coherent work with a beginning, middle, an end - and a point. All the loose ends, including the Gretchen situation, were resolved. This book's disorganized structure and narrative is part of the presentation of the world as seen by a high school student - and I found it to be an interesting world. I recommend this book with the warning that although it is a good book it will drive you crazy.    One last point: I can't help comparing this book to the other popular book written about going to Brother Rice High School: Do Black Patent Leather Shoes Really Reflect Up? That book came out while I was still at Brother Rice and was locally admired. There was even a musical written based on the book that must have ran for ten years at a local theater. It's still running for all I know. The books are much different, however. The main difference is that Meno's book is much less sentimental. He doesn't seem to be as syrupy about Brother Rice as Powers was. I liked Joe Meno's book. I think I can relate to it, maybe, a little better than I can to John Powers.	2005-06-27

When I started *Home Land* I thought for a bit that it would join the list, but about one fourth way through I could see that this book probably wasn't going to make the \\"all time funniest\\" list, although the book is hilarious and worth reading. <br /> <br />Lipsyte's ranting narrator, Lewis Miner, is one funny guy:  <br /> <br />\\"Each of us walks to the beat of a different drummer. It's just that some of these drummers suck\\" <br /> <br />The characters in this book, some of whom, it seems, have written reviews of this book here on Amazon.com (including Dr. Stacy Ryson) are a lot of fun. Miner's fixations are hilarious - he calls one of the characters Jazz Loretta because she was in the Jazz Dancing Club. He describes his ex-wife Gwendolyn as \\"that doe-eyed, elklike beauty.\\" I'm still trying to imagine that. Lewis Miner, a.k.a. \\"Teabag,\\" was pretty unsuccessful in high school, just about the lowest in the social hierarchy, so now he's stuck there writing obsessive, ranting contributions to the alumni newsletter, \\"Catamount Notes,\\" and he can't even get them to print any of them.  <br /> <br />About half way through I became discouraged and almost quit because the book just sort of floundered. Even the author is aware of this, he becomes discouraged and writes of his so-called updates, \\"There are no themes, no leitmotifs. There is no story.\\" <br /> <br />I'm glad I stuck with it, though, because the book just keeps getting funnier even as the plot becomes sillier. Just look at the picture of the author on the back cover. I can imagine the photographer saying, \\"Okay, c'mon! Quit screwing around! Let's take the picture already!\\" <br /> <br />Highly recommended not for classic novel form but for intelligent humor.	2005-03-23

He is showing us his admirable skills as a writer without getting too serious - experimenting with form, flexing his writing muscles. This book is a succinct party piece compared to his other symphonies.<br /><br />This story is, of course, about Sherlock Holmes in his final years (the title implies this is his last case), although I don't think he ever identifies his main character. The mystery is intriguing (I won't give anything away - but I would recommend looking at the book's jacket for clues), the style is brilliant, and the characters are genuine.<br /><br />I have read a number of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories even though I wouldn't necessarily say that I'm a huge fan of the series. As a matter of fact I'd say this story, if compared to the originals, stands up in terms of the mystery aspect, and might even exceed the originals in terms of style. A nice little book.	2005-03-23

I guess that's the point of a thriller - but this one is different. <br /> <br />First of all it isn't about spies or killers - it is about people working in cubicles, making PowerPoint presentations, \\"brainstorming,\\" and figuring out how to sell PDA type devices among other things - and it is extraordinarily interesting. <br /> <br />Secondly the characters seemed real in a way that I did not expect to find in a thriller, especially Adam Cassidy, the main character. I am only an occasional reader in this genre and my impression is that most thrillers are more plot driven (like the curiously popular but abysmal Da Vinci Code) and the characters tend to be stock characters written with perhaps a certain actor in mind. Paranoia's plot moves right along, but the character Adam is expertly and compassionately developed, and I felt empathetic with his plight. His father and his father's caretaker were interesting, as was his good-time buddy Seth (\\"Dude, it's never too late to have a happy childhood.\\") Alana, I guess, was a little more prefab than the other characters. For some reason, no fault of the author's, I got it in my head that the character Jock Goddard was a replica of \\"Mr. Peterman,\\" Elaine's boss from the television show Seinfeld. <br /> <br />Finally the plot resolution was, for me, surprising. Because of the genre I fully expected a formulaic ending along the lines of *The Firm*, or *Wall Street* - but that wasn't the case. <br /> <br />Sidenote: I ended up getting the Wings song *Band on the Run* stuck in my head because of one scene where Adam had that song as an earworm - but I cured that by wearing my iPod as often as possible. That is one insidious earworm - don't let it hhappen to you. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to anybody looking for an engaging, intelligent thriller.	2005-03-23
US	53026841	R10NMJM6W43ULZ	0679727256	952258128	The Gift	Books	5	7	8	N	Y	A imposing, but ultimately extraordinary novel	This is another of those daunting books that I only completed after my third try. I'm glad I stuck with it - difficult but worthwhile. It begins with a portrait of the artist, Fyodor Godunov-Cherdyntsev, as a young man, trying to become a published author, scraping out a nearly destitute existence in Berlin. Like Nabokov, Fyodor's family had formerly been titled landowners in pre-Bolshevik Russia and are now living in exile in Berlin.<br /><br />This book consists of five long chapters - the first describes Fyodor's literary quest, his surroundings, his lifestyle, and some of his poems, published by a small emigre press, as he reminisces over them. The best part of the book is the second chapter where we are taken back to Fyodor's childhood in Russia. There is an amazing description of his father's butterfly collecting expeditions and mysterious death in Central Asia. This section is absolutely fascinating and is among my favorite writings by Nabokov (or anybody else).<br /><br />In chapters three and four the book becomes increasingly confusing. I think Nabokov is trying to challenge the readers to the point where most will just quit right here. Why? I have no idea. For example, on page 154 of the Vintage International edition he changes narrator and point of view - right in the middle of a paragraph! Then twenty pages later he switches back, again mid-paragraph. Our hero, Fyodor Godunov-Cherdyntsev, has a friend and rival named Chernyshevski. In chapter three Fyodor begins to write a book about another Chernyshevski who was an actual historic figure (?) in Russia; then in chapter four we get to read Fyodor's book about the historic Chernyshevski, which according to some of the other reviews is tremendously funny - I guess I didn't get the joke. Sounds like a pitch for a David Lynch movie.<br /><br />Finally, in the last chapter, we are back to Fyodor in Berlin, and this section I did find hilarious - plus Nabokov more or less resolves all the plot elements and wraps up what ends up being a coherent story.<br /><br />Admittedly my lack of knowledge of Russian history (Chernyshevski who?) and ignorance to most of Nabokov's inside jokes and Russian literary illusions prevented me from fully devouring and appreciating this novel - but in spite of that I was impressed and moved. This is the seventh Nabokov novel that I've read and my third favorite (after Pale Fire and Lolita). Well worth the frustration.	2005-01-30

When the story begins he is a person who has for the most part stopped participating in life - fat, alcoholic, heavy smoker, and no self-esteem (but oddly not at all bitter). After both of his parents die on a motor vehicle accident he is trying to settle their affairs. One night, while tremendously drunk, he finds his old Raleigh bicycle in his parent's garage and by accident he rolls of on a journey that will take him across the entire United States.    Every other chapter is a flashback where we learn about Smithy's difficult past, including caring for his nearly always heart-breaking schizophrenic sister (who had a habit of running off and getting in trouble) and his being severely wounded in the Viet Nam War. During the present tense chapters we follow Smithy as he pedals cross country, eats fruit, drops his bad habits, his job, and ultimately his alienation. His redemption comes to fruition in a number of ways: his examination of why he went from being a thin \\"runner\\" (as a child he ran, never walked, everywhere he went) who was an active participant in life to an obese, unhealthy, self-loathing drunk; his cross country healing journey; his reading of a couple of cheesy but inspiring paperbacks; his encounters with various characters along the way - all of whom Smithy helps (and in turn they help Smithy); his \\"closure\\" regarding his sister; and his ultimately finding love that was there all along. Sound corny? Well, in a sense it is - but this is an affecting and fortifying story.    Smithy is a simple person who seems to be nearly empty. He reminds me a bit of \\"Chance\\" from Jerzy Kosinski's Being There - although Smithy is a more intelligent than Chance. All the characters he meets just open up to him. As he sheds pounds and bad habits he seems to shed the weight of his past.    I would suggest that the bike riding readers that enjoyed *The Memory of Running* also read*Heft On Wheels* by Mike Magnuson. This is a non-fiction account of a forty-ish, overweight, drinking, smoking individual who starts taking his cycling seriously and changes his life. It is, however, a much different story - Mike's change is an active process on his part whereas Smithy's change just sort of fortuitously rolls over him. Never the less the two books go together nicely.    This is one of those books that you look forward to reading. Last weekend while I was reading it with the radio on (NPR's West Coast Live) I heard the author being interviewed - talk about serendipity. The author's story of how the book came to be published is in itself fascinating, and I imagine that this book will become inconceivably successful and will be made into a popular movie.	2005-01-29

Mike Magnuson decided to start taking his cycling seriously when he finally grew tired of being dropped on club rides. He had been cycling for some time but at one point he decided to quit drinking, smoking, and to lose weight - and he ultimately ends up completing some truly challenging rides like the \\"Bridge to Bridge Incredible Cycling Challenge\\" (100 miles of steep mountain ascents).    I read this book last summer and found it to be inspirational. Like Mike, I am a large middle-aged athlete, and I lost sixty pounds via cycling (and running, mostly) and various lifestyle changes. Right now I'm training for my eighth full (running) marathon in five years. Although I wasn't inspired by Mike to make the change, having done that five years ago, I found this book helpful as ongoing encouragement for me to continue my newfound habits. Unlike Mike, I still get dropped during hilly club rides, and I'm not as competitive as Mike, but I'm going to guess that he is a sort of hero to lots of people like me.    I am reviewing this book now because I just finished reading a novel, *The Memory of Running,* which has some similarities to this book. The narrator of that novel quit drinking, smoking, and overeating and rode his bike across the United States to ultimately find love, and to become an active member of the human race again. Mike Magnuson's story is much different. Unlike the passive, nearly \\"empty\\" character in *The Memory of Running,* Mike is aggressive and goal oriented. I like the way he made a plan and stuck to it instead of just letting success accidentally roll over him like Smithy did in *The Memory of Running*. Mike chose his change.     Some people have criticized Mike for still being a jerk, or for just replacing one group of obsessions with another. So what? Like Mike says on his website (lummox.org) -  \\"(Do people expect) that everything in life is going to be perfect just because somebody quitssmoking?\\" Of course not.    I enjoyed not only Mike's story but also his writing and I look forward to finding his other books and to future books as well.	2005-01-28

Although I knew who would prevail, the book remained suspenseful. All three had several heartbreaking close calls until one of them (I won't say who in case some readers don't already know) finally broke the four-minute barrier. The three subsequently raced each other (it turned out that only two of the three could participate in the race) and that was suspenseful provided you don't look at the photo section in the middle of the book that shows one of the runners decisively winning. <br /> <br />Evidently the author didn't have enough material for an entire volume, so the book is filled out with thirty pages of skipable footnotes and an over-stuffed fifteen page index (with entries like: \\"Empire Games - Bannister's mood before mile race at\\"), but that's okay - the book's length is just right and it is elegantly written.  <br /> <br />Although I still think *Once a Runner* is the greatest running book of all time, *The Perfect Mile* wins the non-fiction category. Obviously this book will be more interesting to runners, but I think it might have a broad appeal - it is inspirational and entertaining.	2005-01-24

It is not a coherent essay that moves logically from point to point - it is a jarring, manic kaleidoscope.  <br /> <br />Since I am a typical American and only understand one language (English, modern) some of this volume was lost to me - but this book is well worth the time you will spend reading it.

This one is my favorite. It is a portrait of the education of an insecure artist as a young man - struggling in most respects and ultimately becoming a published author. This book is simply beautiful.    This book clearly affected Bukowski and helped him find *his* own style.    A side note - I have selected books randomly from library shelves and read them and have myself found two amazing books (in a sea of uninteresting junk) that I would have otherwise never encountered. I guess that in the era of Amazon.com, where you can read all about the book (from professional reviews to amateur ravings to Amazon.com's AI recommending books based on your browsing patterns), before even seeing the book - the serendipitous approach is less common.     Try this novel and also *Wait Until Spring, Bandini,* and *Road to Los Angeles.* Enchanting books.	2005-01-21

I honestly don't know what to make of this novel.  <br /> <br />Quite a while ago I was watching \\"Book TV\\" on CSPAN2 (I admit it, I'm a nerd - I should have been watching a basketball game like everybody else) and saw a group of book critics discussing contemporary literature. One of the critics was complaining about the poor quality of the reviews on Amazon.com - and I'm certain this review will be a perfect example of that claim. Then he was asked what novelists, writing today, will people be reading 100 years from now. He said Richard Powers. I was embarrassed because I wasn't even familiar with this writer but I wanted to get with the program and read some of his books. I think I bought four of his books, started them all, and this is the only one I finished. <br /> <br />Okay - this book is both amazing and as boring as hell. I am fortunate to have a background in molecular biology so that part wasn't too confusing. It was remarkable how the writer blended all the components of music, biology, painting, librarianship, cryptography, and romance. That part was great. The bad part is that the characters weren't really what I called likeable. The only one I cared about was Ressler as a young man. The one that narrated the most, the librarian - I can't even remember her name - was annoying! I cannot imagine what those two saw in each other, or why they gave a rat's %&# about Ressler's life story. The librarian was so obsessed with the Ressler story and her humdrum love affair that she quit her job! <br /> <br />Yes, this novel was chore (like doing sit-ups) but I guess it was worth it. I often listened to *The Goldberg Variations* while I read it hoping that that would somehow unleash some sort of passion in me that would help me enjoy the final four hundred pages. No dice. Reading Richard Powers is like reading Nabokov where Nabokov is really trying to show off and drop the readers \\"who move their lips while they read\\" by the wayside, but I have to say Nabokov is more fulfilling - he has genuine passion and humor in his novels. <br /> <br />I'd like to give Powers another chance. Two questions for readers of this (hopefully not too dreadful) Amazon review: which Powers novel should I read next, and do you think readers and students will really be reading *The Gold Bug Variations* in 100 years? Email me.	2005-01-14

I started one of the Myron Bolitar stories years ago but never really became engrossed. We have never actually met in person, but now when I go to the bookstore I see a whole section of his books and see that he has become a successful author (congrats!) Since he's a \\"buddy\\" I just have to give this book five well deserved stars.    I  enjoyed the book from start to finish. Some of the plot twists seemed a little absurd but I guess that people read thrillers for plot twists and people read Thomas Mann novels for something else. I just read *The Magic Mountain* and it didn't have much in terms of plot twists. Too bad we couldn't get Mann (R.I.P.) and Coben together to write a novel . . . I bet we'd end up with something along the lines of *The Name of the Rose.*    I have two minor complaints about the novel. The first is my fault: every time the character referred to as \\"the Ghost\\" was in a scene I visualized this crazy large white head - something like the appearance of Jim Carrey in *The Mask,* but white instead of green; or else an appearance like the guy in the Jack in the Box commercials. That was awfully distracting, but then again the character was first described as having \\"skin like cataracts, milky and marshlike  . . . head shaped like a lightbulb . . . nightmare version of a Dresden doll.\\" Yikes!    The other complaint is about the character \\"Squares,\\" who is the second most important character and probably the most interesting character. Why, though, did he have to be a famous yoga guru? The character was strong enough as a street-wise dude who has a somewhat evil past and now drives around in a van trying to help street kids change their lives. The yoga guru component added nothing to the story and wasn't even believable because he hardly ever even went to that job. What gives?    Unlike *The Magic Mountain* this book moved along quickly because it kept me wondering what was going to happen next. The characters, except \\"the Ghost,\\" were well drawn, likeable, and genuine; and the main character's witty quips made the book interesting. I laughed out loud a couple of times. The main character, Will, and the female characters were particularly well done. Hooray for Harlan Coben! I hope you get a big movie deal out of one of these books.	2005-01-14

I used to read and reread the Henry Reed stories by the same author -  but this one was different because it didn't have any pictures, not even on the cover (the Henry Reed series had three or four pictures per volume) and the characters were older (high school age). I recall thinking it was a \\"big\\" book, but this volume I just read is only 186 pages. It's all relative. <br /> <br />I loved this book when I first read it as a nine or ten year old - so 25 years later I decided to reread it and see what my impressions are now. I was amazed that I actually remembered every single scene, character, and plot element. It was like I just read it. <br /> <br />The two main characters - Cloud and Wong - are interesting viewed from today's world. In the book Wong is 100% Cloud's sidekick. He  is his Tonto! There is no evidence that Wong cares about anything except meeting Cloud's needs; and this after Cloud treats him so poorly when they first meet (unabashedly racist) and throughout the book Cloud never really does anything to benefit Wong. It makes me wonder what Wong is getting out of the relationship (besides the joy and pride of seeing Cloud get his Jeep! <br /> <br />Another oddity is that the character Cloud is supposed to be a teenager - but he has a vibe more like a middle aged miltary or ex-military adult. I assume that the character Cloud was based on the author as an adult and not on a teenager. <br /> <br />That having been said I had a blast taking a Jeep drive down memory lane. I would advise anybody who is actually reading this review to go back and reread one of the first novels they ever read. You won't be disappointed.	2005-01-12

Well, I decided to reread Ape and Essence (one of my all time favorite titles for a book, incidentally). The bizarre parts of the book are still great fun (Give me detumescence / that means you), but the story is a little weak as it is more concerned with being shocking, I think, than being a good story. I would recommend Island (a utopian novel) instead. In Ape and Essence the fact that the humor is so dated is interesting.	2005-01-03

I read it as somebody to whom this particular music scene was inexpressably important. Before my crappy former ISP ate and digested my website (some of you may remember evol.org), and I subsequently developed other interests, I used to run a well known website about Sonic Youth and The Minutemen; and it has always been one of my dreams to publish a book about my favorite band: The Minutemen.  <br /> <br />I still might do that!  <br /> <br />This book was a lot of fun to read - I recommend it to anybody who is interested in this era. I give this book a strong five stars even though I agree with a lot of the criticisms that were outlined in the review dated July 4, 2003. But in spite of these problems I ask: where else are you going to find a book like this? It is unreal to expect the book to be a fat encyclopedia - punk rockers just don't have that type of attention span - although I admit sections on the Meat Puppets and the DKs would have been nice. Or X, for that matter. But then again there were sections on bands I had hardly ever heard of like Beat Happening - that was refreshing. And also - it is obvious Azerrad loves and respects these bands as much as I do - but that doesn't mean he has to completely put them on a pedestal. <br /> <br />Azerrad, it appears, sees 1984 as a pinnacle of punk/post punk music. Well, so do I. If you were listening to this music in 1984, or if you are just now discovering it - buy the book. You'll be glad you did.	2004-12-12

If you are lucky enough to have read Bob's first book that came in and out of print about fifteen years ago, or to have followed along with all his columns over the years in Velo News or wherever, then maybe this book isn't for you. You can try to buy his original book on ebay for a hundred and fifty bucks if you are a purist. If you want to jam econo then just get this book. It is great. Thanks Bob!	2004-12-12

Also, it is set in my home town (Chicago), and a quick scan promised something along the lines of James Ellroy's *The Big Nowhere.* After I read the first chapter my hopes were high -  but then the book disintegrated into about six different stories that I thought were inelegantly linked. It seemed like Branton had several projects that he thought were good and stirred them together to make a novel. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out which story I was reading.	2004-12-09

As a whole, though, it lacks quality: great writer - weak book. As I worked through it I thought, \\"I can't wait for his next book - it should be better.\\" (It is out now, I see, but I will wait for the paperback version.) One more thing - the characters were interesting and well drawn - but none of them were likeable.	2004-12-09

I enjoyed the book a great deal and stayed up later than normal each night reading it.  <br /> <br />I thought it was curious that the author is a writing teacher yet a lot of the story telling was, well, less succinct than a writing teacher would let a writing student get away with. Also, the writer, when he really gets in his element, has a peculiar way of using a lot of commas, which for me is distracting and decelerating - but I think this is his personal style and ultimately it works. <br /> <br /> Whenever I read a book like this my impression is that the writer isn't writing a book but is writing something they hope will be made into a movie. I don't know if this one will be filmed - I hope it will.	2004-11-12

After looking at the cover and reading the blurbs I was hesitant to even begin reading it. It seemed like it might be sort of &quot;corny.&quot; Well it wasn't. The ending of this book - to use an old fashioned phrase - blew my mind. Highly recommended.	2004-08-05

When I saw it at the library I thought, \\"Oh, Okay . . . another book about some writer's childhood.\\" But I grabbed it anyway thinking that it might be fun reading a sort of autobiography of a person with whom I an totally  unfamiliar. I ended up enjoying it. Doty is only a little older than me -  but his childhood was amazingly different than mine. Sometimes it was  hilarious - like the description of his mild contempt for his fellow dance  school student. Or his getting caught dressed in drag practicing show tunes  in his room. At other times it was terribly sad and pathetic - his mother's  end, for example. Parts of it left me a little astonished - \\"Huh? His  parents dropped him of on the highway so he could hitch to San Francisco at  age fourteen?\\"  After reading his intriguing childhood memoir I will  certainly be reading some of Doty's poetry.	2000-04-30

What a tremendous book. A fascinating and erudite study of horror films. Thirty years ago I was a child with dozens of pictures from  the magazine *Famous Monsters of Filmland* plastered all over my bedroom  wall. This book has given me a great deal of insight into the genre with  which I was once obsessed. The book is fun and the pictures are a hoot as  well.	2000-04-05

When I told a friend of mine (who is a librarian at our local library) that C. P. had published two other books after Fight Club, she immediately went ahead and oredered both of them. Now I'm sort of embarrassed that I  even brought it up. Palahniuk has a distinct voice and this book has a  &quot;hip&quot; feel to it - but other than that this book is just . . .  well . . . sort of *dumb.* I think Palahniuk has been spending a litle too  much time watching Fashion Emergency on E.<br />I thought it was signifying  that in the dedication to Invisible Monsters one of the three people he  dedicated was his editor who apparently said something like, &quot;THIS is  not good enough.&quot;<br />Don't get me wrong, though; I'm still looking  forward to Palahniuk's next novel. He's REAL young and REAL prolific so I  expect more novels . . . hopefully of Fight Club's quality.	2000-01-29

Although Doctor Yu  was in  Venezuela studying the Pume hunter gatherers on a grant from the Leakey  Foundation for research purposes this book is ANYTHING but a dry academic  tome. I'm certain that the rigid data filled, theory drenched, anthropology  journal language encrusted, esoteric conclusion oriented version of this  trip exists somewhere in the halls of academe - but this isn't it.<br /><br />This  is a wonderful working of Pei Lin's journal from a year and a half of  observing the hunter gatherer Pume Indians. Pei Lin not only observes but  becomes emerged in their lives.<br /><br />First a synopsis: Pei Lin is asked by her  long time friend (and lover?) Rusty to accompany him on a one and a half  year project to gather data on a group of hunter gatherers in the remote  Venezuelan grasslands. There are not many people like the Pume left in the  world, and the few that are still living the traditional hunter gatherer  lifestyle, I would imagine, are probably constantly being followed around  by film crews from the National geographic and other similar organizations.  These Pume folk, though, are still pretty original - if you catch my drift.  Pei and Rusty have their daily duties of observing everything these folks  do, cataloging and weighing their daily food intake, taking \\"anthropometric  measurements,\\" and what not.<br /><br />But more than that Pei Lin is a keen  observer of their personal lives, their humor (yes, there is a small  section on stork hunting jokes), their religion and their dance ceremonies.  In addition to that it is Pei's personal story. While they were there Pei  and Rusty \\"went native\\" (my term, not theirs) and lived not only WITH but  AS the Pume. They ate what they ate, (interestingly Pei Lin went from a  nearly lifelong, well fed vegetarian to a half-starved wisp craving a tasty  hunk of crocodile tail or anteater steak), drank what they drank, feared  what they feared, and so on.<br /><br />Pei Lin encounters death and illness in the  Pume and nearly died herself from parasitic infestations. The subtitle of  the book suggests that this book is from a woman's perspective and that it  is. Pei gossips with the women while Rusty hobnobs with the men and  participates in hallucinogenic rituals. When he accompanies the men on  hunting expedition she accompanies the women on root and mango gathering  trips, or stays at camp to help care for the children. She also aids a  battered woman; participates in a tragic birth (wherein one of two twins  dies, but the other survives); and must adhere to some strange menstrual  rituals (no fish may be eaten while she was restricted to the menstrual hut  - even if fish was all there WAS to eat on a given day.) And Pei has a  particular fondness for observing and describing the old women in the  group.<br /><br />The book also includes some fascinating (but too brief)  descriptions of Pei Lin's dreams while she was in Venezuela, and some  descriptions of the day to day frustrations of life that follow one  anywhere.<br /><br />I LOVE THIS BOOK. This book is not only fascinating, it is  tremendously fun and as a bonus he book is peppered with Pei's splendid  illustrations. This book is for everybody, not just academic types, and has  my absolute highest recommendationsank, feared  what they feared, and so on.
