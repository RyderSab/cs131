Its real different. NO ONE ever did a story about two female rappers. I admire the fact that she had an African American female rapper as well as a Hispanic female rapper.  <br /> <br />This story pinpoints alot of things in the music industry such as phony record labels, drugs, violence <br />and money. But at the end there is a huge turn around. Purchase this book so you can also enjoy Sabrina Steelo and Fatal Beauty. <br /> <br />	2004-09-25

This book was crazy. man, Johnny had me up all night trying to finish this book. I kind of don't believe he messed around with all those young ladies while he was in college. But besides all that this book was entertaining. I hope there is a sequel because I am dying to know what happened after he graduated from college.	2004-09-25

But anyhow, I did remember Rashaun and I kinda remember some parts but i say all this to say that this was a good book. It kinda got deep toward the end and thats when I was like so into this book. But you HAVE to read the other two funk novels to understand this book.	2004-08-31

Violet was a strong woman to me because she put up with a lot of mess from her sister and past lovers. Rose betrayed her sister. This book is intense and steamy. I hope there is a sequel to this novel because it was really a good book.	2004-08-31

Mr. Gainer suprised me because I was looking for more of a Dumb As Me story (his previous novel) but instead I got a urban novel that he could of sold to triple crown publications (since thats thier style of writing) but I managed to finish this book in 2 days and this was book was OK you read it once you read them all.

Now I don't like to get into details about the books that I read because I might just ruin it. But I am going to make an exception. At first I put this book on hold for like 2 months. Now I was wrong for that because this book was really good.  <br /> <br /> Jaylin is the type of man your mother warned you about. He is handsome, great career, and definitely a lovemaker. But he has a weakness for women. He dosen't know what he wants but he makes sure he keeps a woman around. Now all the leading ladies in this novel love them some Jaylin. They are all addicted to him. But Jaylin has a problem. He wants evertyone to himself and no one can stop him. Now, I know I really didin't go into details because I don't want to ruin the storyline but GO GET THIS BOOK. You will not be disapointed. I am waiting for MY way or No way (the continuing story to Two's enough) to arrive in the mail any day now.	2004-07-25

This book details everything that goes on behind the music industry. Now I am not in the music industry nor am I behind the scenes. But I have friends who are behind the scenes (they love every minute of it) that said she was &quot;right on point&quot; with this book. The best thing I like about this novel is that it wasn't an &quot;urban&quot; novel. Now isn't this funny it took me about 3 days to read this book (which is about over 500 pages)and the average book with about 200-300 pages it takes me about a week. Now isn't that backwards.      I hope to hear from this author very soon.	2004-07-08

I am also picky with men if they aren't a certain way I will not get involved with them. But kuddos to you Ms. Roylat for creating a story about this. Also, people were relating this book to ON the Down Low by J.L.King . I wouldn't compare these two books , the only similiar thing is when the father in the book was having sex with men but he was only in 4 chapters that was it. But anyway, this book was a really good I am now reading \\"Waiting To Exit Hell\\" by the same author. So far so good. Look out for my review on that novel.	2004-06-04

This book was not good at all and I am glad I rented it from the library instead of purchasing it. I totally agree with one of the reviewers that said she rushed when she was writing the book.

And I sometimes wonder why I( a respectable young lady that has a whole lot of things going for herself and almost a college graduate) prefer thugs instead of gentlemen. And this book reminded me why I exchanged the thugs for the 9 to 5 men.  This book was really crazy and I am glad I am not involved with anyone in the game because the game would shatter you. The ending shocked me, I enjoyed this book and I can't wait for her next book. Also, a lot of grammatical errors (too many to be an author) And I am not talking about the slang words just the basic words. Please proofread for the next novel.	2004-04-14
