I FOUND HIM TO BE FUNNY, CANDID AND INTERESTING. HE USES A LOT OF WORDS AND TERMS THAT MAY NOT BE FOR ANYONE UNDER 18. DAWKINS WAS PURE POWER FOR THE 76ERS DURING HIS CAREER WITH THEM. HE COULD BREAK BACKBOARDS AND SHATTER THE GLASS AROUND THEM. HE WAS STRONG AS A BULL BUT GOT IN FOUL TROUBLE VERY OFTEN. HE CAME TO THE PROS STRAIGHT FROM HIGH SCHOOL. VERY UNUSUAL FOR THE TIMES. HIS LIFE OFF THE COURT IS MORE INTERESTING THAN ON. HIS VARIOUS ADDICTIONS TO ALCOHOL, DRUGS AND SEX HURT HIS PLAY WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE THAN IT WAS. I LIKE THIS BOOK BUT BE AWARE OF THE LANGUAGE AND SEX TERMS.	2004-12-04

SOME HIGHLIGHTS ARE DESCRIBING HOW HE PUTS HIS UNIFORM ON IN A DETAILED ORDER, OLD STORIES ABOUT EDDIE SHORE, AND HIS ACTUAL TIME ON THE ICE PLAYING GOAL DURING A COUPLE OF EXHIBITION GAMES MAKE THIS A GREAT READ.	2004-12-04

OSCAR DOES A GOOD JOB DESCRIBING HIS LIFE ON AND OFF THE COURT. HE GOES INTO DETAIL ABOUT FORMER COACHES, TEAMATES, AND OPPONENTS DESCRIBING HIS RELATIONSHIPS AND FEELINGS. I FOUND OSCAR TO BE VERY HONEST BUT SOMETIMES BITTER AND DEPRESSED. STILL I THINK HE IS A PRETTY GOOD GUY AND HAD A LOT OF CLASS. I REMEMBER HIM AS A COMMENTATOR FOR CBS AND JUST LOVING HIM GETTING EXCITED DURING A GAME BY YELLING \\"OH WHAT MOVE BY KAREEM\\". THIS IS A REALLY GOOD BOOK FOR ALL FANS OF PRO BASKETBALL.

I FOUND BILL TO BE HONEST, REFRESHING AND OPINIONATED. I DON'T AGREE WITH SOME BUT HE MAKES MANY GOOD POINTS. HE DOES NOT GET INTO HIS PRIVATE LIFE TOO MUCH BUT THAT IS WHY IT IS CALLED PRIVATE. I ENJOYED HIS STORIES AND PHILOSOPHIES OF JOHN WOODEN AND THE OTHER COACHES HE PLAYED FOR. WALTON WAS A REBEL IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS BUT HAS CALMED DOWN. HIS FEET INJURIES TOOK AWAY A GREAT CAREER.

IT IS EASY TO READ AND QUITE INTERESTING. THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES IN GREAT DEAL THE ADVERSITY HE FACED DURING THE 1975 SEASON. FROM PLAYER, FAN, AND MEDIA ABUSE FRANK HAD A VERY TURBULENT SEASON. I AM AN INDIAN'S FAN AND REMEMBER HIS TENURE AS MANAGER IN GREAT DETAIL. ALWAYS A FIGHTER, OUTSPOKEN, AND VOLATILE, FRANK WAS NOT A SUCESSFUL MANAGER IN CLEVELAND AS HIS FIRING THE FOLLOWING SEASON INDICATES. HIS LATER TENURES IN BALTIMORE AND SAN FRANCISO WERE BETTER. A VERY NICE READ WITH SOME INTERESTING TALES OF HIS ENCOUNTERS WITH THE MEN IN BLUE.	2004-01-11

SOMETIMES CRUDE, FUNNY, SAD, HONEST, AND GROSS. HE TELLS IT LIKE IT IS DESCRIBING IN DETAIL HIS LIFE AND CAREER. HIS LANGUAGE LEAVES MUCH TO BE DESIRED AT TIMES, BUT OVERALL THIS IS A VERY ENTERTAINING BOOK. HIS INSIGHT AND OPINIONS ARE VERY CANDID AND CONTROVERSIAL. I THINK HE NEEDS TO BE IN REHAB FOR ALCOHOL AND FOOT IN MOUTH ADDICTION. BUT STILL VERY WORTH READING. HE IS NOT A BAD GUY BUT JUST HUMAN AND VERY OUT SPOKEN. TURN IT DOWN A BIT BOOMER.	2003-11-09

IT IS IN THIS DAY BY DAY RERELLING THAT THIS BOOK REALLY STANDS OUT. IT ALSO HAS GREAT PHOTOS THAT REALLY STAND OUT AND HELP BRING THE STORY COME TOGETHER. A MUST READ FOR NOSALGIA AND FANS OF ST LOUIS.	2002-05-25

BUT FOR A TRIVIA AND NOSTALGIC TV WATCHER THIS IS A GOOD BOOK TO HAVE.<BR>VERY RECOMMENDED.	2002-05-12

HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD HAS CARRIED HIM THROUGH MANY TRYING TIMES IN HIS CAREER AND PRIVATE LIFE.

I REMEMBER WHEN TOMMY WAS A ROOKIE WITH INDIANS AND WHAT A MAJOR MISTAKE THE INDIANS MADE IN TRADING HIM. ALSO WOTH MENTIONING  IS HIS COME BACK FROM HIS (BIONIC) LIGAMENT REPLACEMENT AND THE TRAGIC FALL OF HIS INFANT SON AND THE VIGIL AND FAITH HE AND HIS WIFE HAD DURING THESE TRYING TIMES.

(ALTHOUGHT HE PITCHED SOLIDLY FOR THE RED SOX LAST YEAR. HE HAS HAD SOME GREAT SEASONS AND IS ONE OF THE BETTER PITCHERS IN THE 80'S AND 90'S. BUT THIS COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER.  TOO MUCH TIME WASTED ABOUT HIS LAST SEASON. TOO BAD MR. ANGELL DIDN'T SPEND MORE TIME RELIVING HIS DAYS WITH THE METS AND MORE OF HIS GOOD YEARS WITH THE YANKEES.

THE OVER CONFIDENCE, BARREN FARM SYSTEM, BAD TRADES, AND AGE ARE WELL DEFINED BY MR. BASHE. ANOTHER INTERESTING REACTION BY THE YANKEES DURING THE EARLY PART OF THE NOSE DIVE IS BEING IN DENIAL ABOUT THE THING FOR A FEW YEARS. THEY JUST DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO REACT TO BEING AN ALSO RAN. ALSO OF NOTE IS THE COLD HEARTED FRONT OFFICE SELLING THE TEAM TO CBS AND THE BUMBLING YEARS OF OWNERSHIP DURING THE CBS OWNERSHIP. THEN THE RESURGENCE DURING THE STEINBRENNER YEARS AND THE DOWN YEARS DURING HIS DICTATORSHIP. ALL THIS MAKES FOR A VERY INTERESTING AND WELL DONE NOVEL.

HIS DESCRIPTION OF HIS MANY KNEE INJURIES HAD ME WINCING AND MY KNEES WERE HURTING JUST READING ABOUT THE PAIN HE ENDURED THRU OUT HIS CAREER. AN AMAZING MAN WITH SUCH A TOLERANCE FOR PAIN. HIS RETELLING OF EARLY RAIDER DAYS WAS VERY NOSTALGIC. I ENJOYED HIS COMMENTS ABOUT LYNN SWANN AND VARIOUS OTHER FORMER PLAYERS AND OWNERS.

I ALSO DISLIKED A FEW THINGS IN THIS BOOK. IT WAS INTERESTING WHEN IT STAYED FOCUSED ON THE CAREER AND LIFE OF Y.A. HIS EXPERIENCES WITH THE COLTS, 49ERS AND GIANTS IS EXCEPTIONALLY WELL DONE. THE BOOK IS WRITTEN BY HIS DAUGHTER WHO DOES A GOOD JOB OVERALL. BUT SHE RAMBLES ON AND ON ABOUT SOME BORING CHILDHOOD MEMORIES AND NEVER REALLY DOES A GOOD JOB OF TELLING US WHAT KIND OF PERSON AND FATHER TITTLE IS. SHE TRIES TO BE TO TOO DEATILED AND CREATIVE DESCRIBING THINGS OF MINOR IMPORTANCE. BUT SHE IS TALENTED AND VERY SWEET. I DONT WANT TO BE TOO HARD ON THIS BOOK. I RECOMMEND IT FOR ALL GIANT FANS AND FANS WHO WANT TO READ ABOUT A GREAT QUARTERBACK.	2002-01-21

SAMMY HAS MANY VALUES AND BELIEFS THAT ARE TRULY NEEDED BY MOST OF TODAYS ATHLETES. SAMMY IS TRULY A BREATH OF FRESH AIR IN HIS ENTHUSIASM AND LOVE OF THE GAME. THE BOY IN SAMMY IS ALIVE AND KICKING. I ADMIRE SAMMY A LOT MORE NOW THAT I HAVE READ THIS BOOK. A MUST READ FOR ALL BASBALL FANS AND FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED SOME GRATITUDE AND HUMILITY IN THEIR LIFE.	2002-01-19

THE FIRST HALF IS ALL ABOUT KEN HARRELSON TELLING YOU HOW GREAT HE IS A VARIOUS THINGS LIKE POOL, GOLF, AND GAMBLING. HE CERTAINLY IS FULL OF HIMSELF (and some other stuff). THE SECOND HALF DEALS WITH HIS CAREER IN BASEBALL. HE HAS SOME GREAT STORIES LIKE  WHEN HE RODE CHARLEY FINLEY'S MULE CHARLIE O. IT IS VERY HUMOROUS AND WELL TOLD. HAWK HAD A LOT OF PIZAZZ AND WAS VERY COLORFUL. AN UNFORTUNATE ANKLE INJURY FINISHED HIS CAREER. BUT HAWK WAS AND IS A GOOD THING FOR BASEBALL.

I WANTED TO READ ABOUT HIS GREAT CAREER IN BASBALL, BUT WHAT I GOT WAS OVER 200 PAGES OF WHAT A GREAT GUY SPARKY IS AND A LESSON IN HUMILITY, DIGNITY AND HOW TO TREAT PEOPLE IN GENERAL. SPARKY COMES ACROSS AS TRULY BEING A VERY SINCERE AND HONEST MAN. I BELIEVE HE REALLY IS A GOOD PERSON AND AND A GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW TO LIVE YOUR LIFE. HE HAS DONE MUCH CHARITY WORK AND IS A VERY GIVING INDIVIDUAL. TO SPEND MUCH OF THE BOOK TELLING ABOUT THIS WAS NOT WHAT I BOUGHT IT FOR. IF YOU TRULY WANT TO FIND OUT ABOUT SPARKY THE PERSON THEN THIS IS FOR YOU. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WANT A LOT OF BASEBALL STORIES AND NOSTALGIA THEN YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.	2001-12-28

LOPEZ IS PREJUDICE AGAINST BLACKS. GIVE ME A BREAK. HE HAD BLACKS ON EVERY TEAM HE MANAGED. I AM NOT CONCERNED ABOUT PREJUDICE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST AL LOPEZ.
