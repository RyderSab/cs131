Although it was a good book, it wasn't as well written and didn't seem to go as smoothly as some of her other books.  I wouldn't recomend somebody getting this particular book and judging her writing style on it.  Shadow Games or any of her many other Dark books is much better written.  Maybe she is getting tired of the characters? Dayan seemed to just go on and on, he was too one dimensional.  Still, I give it 4 stars because it is a good book, just not up to Feehan's usual standards.	2003-10-31

The story in this book was what caught my attention, but I found the writing hard to swallow.  It was almost like she was writing to a younger audience, with adult themes. The story was great, but I can't give it five stars because to be honest, the book didn't hold my attention like it should. I found myself skimming, instead of reading.	2003-08-08

While she still has some unusual twists in her story, this time I didn't like it as well. <BR>  The heroine, katherine, is an abused, overweight woman who is married to a jerk, and has a father who is insane.  The Hero, Sion, is a man who has tortured himself for years over the death of his first wife.  When Katherine has a wreck in her carriage on the way to London to meet her husband, she ends up at Sions estate in a coma for months.  Sion is still an alcoholic, until his last servant leaves and He is forced to take care of her and himself.  Katherine wakes up, to find her self slim, and Sion ends up getting sober.  They still have their battles with their weaknesses, she is scared she will become overwieght again, and he thinks about going back to the bottle.  Through it all, they start to fall in love. <BR> Katherine decided she doesn't want to go back to her old life, and they decide to make things look like she died in the carriage accident. Her father comes to verify, along with her husband, and everything seems to be fine. Then, they move to london and the whole story seems to fall apart.  Katherine ends up acting like a total jerk, with Sion being drug into the fray. After they went to London, I had a difficult time finding sympathy for Katherine, because she acted like a spoiled brat. If I was Sion I would have tossed her out on her ear. I don't want to spoil the story, just suffice it to say that Katherines charactor didn't act like I would have expected her to at the beginning of the story. I am not sure that I can reccomend the book because of it. But hey, the beginning was good, which is why I rated it at a three and not lower.	2003-03-04

Varek and Christine are great charactors, and kept me interested till the end. I thought the ending was a little abrupt, but at least it was fairly happy. There are some reality problems (6 miscarriages and they don't suspect anything?) but over all I would reccomend this book.  Christine and Varek have been married for 10 years, and when Christine can't produce a child, Varek is forced to set her aside.  Christine, unable to watch her husband marry another, runs away and marries someone else. When they meet again in venice 6 years later, Varek's wife has died in childbirth and Christine is married with a son.  What follows is the struggle Christine has, both against Varek and her desire to be with him. <BR>  I am definitly going to try her next one &quot;While you slept&quot;.	2003-02-25

Elena is not your everyday herione of a book.  she has a lot of issues and deals with things as they come.  Truly a refreshing charactor. Elena was bitten by her fiance who is a werewolf. She has never forgiven him for it, and finds herself the only female werewolf to survive.  She decides that she is going to go to the city and try to have a normal life, such as it is.  She gets engaged to a nice &quot;normal&quot; man, and is living her life, when she is called back to the &quot;pack&quot; to deal with some renegade werewolves, or &quot;mutts&quot;.  When she gets there, she has to deal with her ex, the pack that she belongs too, and some &quot;mutts&quot; that have managed to organize themselves enough to create havoc. This is a strong woman, who makes no apologies for what she is. I am going to get her next book, &quot;Stolen&quot; as soon as it comes out.	2003-02-25

It was, but I had a hard time staying interested in it.  We meet the heroine in a pub, essentially she is a stripper.  She gets kidnapped, and put into a harem.  Now there is a man that is supposed to be a spy, who gets kidnapped and made to be a \\"guest\\" at this same pasha's palace. When they meet, these two seem to be having sex all the time, in the most unusual circumstances. Which would be interesting, but I really didn't get the impression that they liked each other very much.  They just liked having sex.  The Vampire story line really didn't go anywhere either.  It was like the author decided to  just throw that in, for some added story line. I had a hard time finishing this book...	2001-06-08

The leading lady is in her thirties,  and the leading man has been in a fire, with the scars on his face and hands to show for it.  She decides that she is going to get some sexual experiance, and then move on with her life.  She had seen this man 17 years before, but he never saw her, because she was to plain.  When she sees him again, under some unusual circumstances, she doesn't see his scars. She sees him. There is an underlying plot that was somewhat confusing until the end. I like the fact that it had a story line and the characters seemed to love each other.  So often in these types of books, the author gets so involved in making sure there is enough sex, that they forget the story. That is not the case here.  It is graphic, the abuse that he took as a child is told in detail, and is pretty disgusting. But then that is what has shaped him to be the kind of man he is. I can't wait until the book on Gabriel!	2001-06-08

This author has created a whole new world with her novels.  I have read every one, and I am eagerly awaiting more.  This story is about the daughter that was concieved in the first book of this series. I will say that I think that she could have been made to be a stronger person than she is in the book.  She has been given time.  More time than he thought he could give her,and now he must have her, or die. The story starts out with her companion getting killed, after her show.  She is a Magician, and a carpathian.  Gregori needs her, and the trials and tribulations they go through to find a middle ground between his needs and hers will keep you hooked until the end of the book.  I wouldn't say that this is the best book of the series, but it is well worth a read.  If you want to start at the beginning, start with the first one &quot;Dark Prince&quot; and you will be hooked!	2001-06-08

It is about two people who start out in totally different circumstances.  The first time they see each other, she is a half gypsy girl with a deformed hand, that is going home  with the father she had just met. He is a boy that is going to prison, who  had just seen his father brutally murdered.  This was a well written book,  with a few surprises in the story line that keeps you reading.  The  explanation they give for palm reading is very interesting. When they  finally do get together, they have some trials and tribulations that they  must deal with.  I haven't read many of King's books, but I will be looking  for them now. Enjoy!	2000-06-09

It is set in an imperial society.  The two main charactors in the book are from nobility, and are going to be married in an  &quot;arranged marriage&quot;.  As you can guess, having never met each  other, they are not happy about the situation. There is a couple sub-plots  running around in this book, that makes it interesting.  If you like the  historical romances set in medievil times, you will probably like this one.  I have read &quot;Hearts Prey&quot; and it is set in the same world. It is  worth the time.	2000-06-09

I picked it up, because I normally like Amanda Ashley, but I didn't like this book.  I tried to read the whole thing, because I had paid for it, but it was very  difficult to keep my attention on the book. I really had no sympathy for  the  main female character. She acted like a spoiled brat, with no  redeeming qaulities. I couldn't understand the guy's motivation for liking  her. Even in the end, she acts like a pain. It is not the worst book I have  ever read, hence the two stars, but I wouldn't recommend it.	2000-06-01

She knows a lot of the things they do are not quite right, but she follows them anyway.  Once she gets to her homeland, she meets a  man who is very different from her, but seems to know more about her  culture than she does. The romance in this book is almost treated secondary  to the good versus evil story that is threaded throughout the book. While I  liked the book, I thought that it dragged on in spots, and Gar, the man she  falls for, comes out looking a little too simple. It's still a good book,  and worth the time to read.	2000-06-01

It tells you how to see confirmation flaws, what they are, and how they can affect your horse.  It gives common illnesses, what they are, how they are caused,  symptoms, treatment, and sometimes long term care for the particular  problem.  It explains in great detail the structure of the foot, general  guidelines on feeding, and most of the things that new or old horse people  either need to know, or need to remember.  An outstanding choice.  I know  that this book is sometimes offered through mail order tack catologs such  as Jeffers or Stateline. I would never give mine up!	2000-04-28

I was dissapointed.  I didn't think that this one flowed as well as the others in this series.  It is still a pretty good book, but it didn't  hold me like the other ones did. I think that the author had built up  Rothgar so much, that when she did write his story, she didn't quite know  what to do with him. Diana was at one minute a mature person, the next  childish.  That was a little hard to believe, considering how old she was  and the responsiblity she had. I found the bedroom scenes few and far  between, unlike her previous. To me, if they were really that passionate  about each other, they would have been there a whole lot more. This is  still a good book, but not one of her best.	2000-04-11

The biggest thing wrong with it is that I kept thinking there was a book before it I should have read.  It keeps refering to events in the past, like I should already know of it.  I eventually  figured it out, but I think that this one should have been a sequel, not a  first book.  I would recommend it to most people though, it is a good book.  They run a detective agency, and all of them seem to be trying to figure  out why they like Evan. Kevin is struggling to understand his paternal  feelings.  Lily occasionally gets confused by her emotions for Evan.  Even  Evan is trying to figure out why he wants to stay alive.  Meanwhile, you  are trying to figure out why they don't know.

I think it might have  been better if I had read them all at once, instead of having to wait for  the next one to come out. Maybe they would have flowed a little better.

Let me tell you, it didn't matter.  Shea and Jacques were great!  The story line kept you deeply involved and  thinking about what was going to happen the whole time. Even though you  don't hear much about them in the first book, you really get involved with  them in this one. I would like to see Alex's story, But most of all, I want  to see Gregori.

But the author solves this problem by focusing on the other sister.   In a way it was very frustrating, because I wanted to hear more about  Isabeu. I felt that the author turned around and made Isabeu a weaker  character than she was in the first book.  Yes, she went through a lot but  still... It just didn't seem correct. Her sister comes out very well.  I  almost didn't like her in the first book, but changed my mind after the  first two chapters.
