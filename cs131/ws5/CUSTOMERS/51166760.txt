The story has all of the elements of a first-rate novel with high stakes. During World War Two, the allied invasion of Europe will likely fail if the German army is waiting on the French coast, so the allies construct a massive, fake army pointed toward the Pas de Calais. If it misleads the Germans, the allies can invade Normandy with hope for success. But a larger-than-life, German spy, Henry (Heinrich) Faber photographs the fraud and heads toward Scotland to contact a German submarine and carry his photos to Germany. If he succeeds, the invasion will fail. But the British MI5 detects him, and the chase is on, as Faber makes his way north, killing person after person. Can the British stop him? The outcome depends on a professor, a police officer, and a young, British woman. The climax may leave you breathless. It is a tale that you should enjoy immensely.	2005-10-12

At the time, I found it deeply moving because the author had also exhibited great courage - in combat in the south Pacific, in the Senate, and in the White House during the Cuban missile crisis, when he stood toe to toe with the Soviet Union and forced it to back down. Recently, I reread the book, and it resonates as well today as it did fifty years ago. Kennedy was obviously a great admirer of courage, and he gives us eight examples of Americans who stood up against enormous pressure to stick to their principles. John Quincy Adams, Daniel Webster, Thomas Hart Benton, Sam Houston, Edmund G. Ross, Lucius Q. C. Lamar, George W. Norris, and Robert A. Taft were men of courage, and at this time in America's history, it is well to remind ourselves of their gifts to us. This Pulitzer Prize-winning book is well worth reading today.	2005-09-19

During the war in Europe, Sweden remained neutral, and it was an advantage for both sides, since it provided a contact point for diplomats, spies, and all manner of shadowy people. It also was a lifesaver for American, British, and German flyers when their planes were wrecked by enemy action. If you could make it to Sweden, you were interned for the duration of hostilities. You were not a prisoner. You were more like a guest who cannot leave. <br />This happened to me near Berlin on May 29, 1944, when fierce attacks by German fighter planes knocked out two of my B-17 bomber's engines, wrecked the right wing, and caused fuel to pour from a ruptured tank. The bomber could never reach England, so the plane staggered across Germany and the Baltic to skid on its belly across the grass of the Bulltofta airfield outside of Malmo, Sweden. The Swedes were wonderfully kind, and I lived a quiet, civilian life in a lovely valley at Loka Brunn until released from internment. <br />At least 162 American planes landed or crashed in Sweden. In a research effort that must have taken years, Bo Widfeldt and Rolph Wegmann have carefully documented the story of each plane and its crew members. Amazingly, they have photos of many of the wounded planes, and some of the crews, as they came to rest on Swedish soil. This is the definitive book about this aspect of World War Two. Every flyer is listed and a special tribute is made to those flyers who died trying to \\"make it to Sweden.\\"	2005-09-08

The smart-mouthed protagonist is not. Still, the story carries the day. Here we have a crime in which people murder the president's chief of staff, his wife, and secret service guards. When the same group threatens the president, a task force forms to catch the bad guys and protect the president. Sean Drummond, an army JAG major assigned to the CIA is part of the group. He is assigned to work with FBI agent Jennifer Margold. As more bodies accumulate, he finds that she is very bright. Together, they investigate the crimes until the bad guys offer to stop the murders for 50 million in cash. Drummond is to deliver the money. At this point, things get tense, leading to the climax. Take the book with you on your next trip. It will pass the time nicely.	2005-08-29

He extended that experience when he joined Admiral Richard Byrd for exploration of the Antarctic and became the first man to pilot a plane over the South Pole. During World War Two, Balchen joined the US Air Force as a Colonel and flew hazardous missions to help the Norwegian Resistance fight the Nazis. He and a handful of pilots also flew planes between Stockholm, a neutral hotbed of allied and axis spies, and Scotland. They carried a mixed group of spies, secret types, Norwegian resistance fighters, and one night they carried me. I was interned by the Swedish Government when my bomber crash-landed in Sweden. When I was released, a Balchen plane carried me out while it dodged German night-fighter planes over Norway. Balchen's motto was, \\"Vee do it,\\" and he certainly did. The book is a fascinating story by a courageous man.	2005-08-08

It has 79 pieces about cats, written by a variety of people with the common bond of loving cats. It begins with a poem by T.S. Eliot on the three names that each cat has (and you thought that your cat had only one name). Dave Barry contributes his look at cats. Don Knotts tells us how his cat gets stranded while climbing tall, mesh drapes. You may not have a dry eye after you read Gail Brennan's, \\"Ode to Sissy.\\" There is a judge who keeps his cat in his courtroom for its calming effect during trials. There are stories by pro athletes and by people in all walks of life, each sharing a love of cats. We see Socks (President Clinton's cat), Garfield, and Felix. It's an enjoyable book.	2005-08-08

Keller lives quietly in an apartment in New York City. He reads the Times, watches TV, eats in restaurants, and does the things that New Yorkers do. But occasionally, he gets a summons to White Plains, where he drinks lemonade with Dot, a witty, fast-talking woman, and receives an assignment. He then packs a bag, flies to a city across the country, and kills someone. Returning, considerably richer, he resumes his New York life until Dot calls again. Now, Lawrence Block has worked the Playboy pieces into an entertaining, yet thoughtful, story of a man whose profession is killing people. The murders are a tiny part of the story. Far more interesting is Keller's unassuming life and his interactions with a pet dog, a girlfriend, and especially with Dot. Much of the book is downright funny, as it smashes the stereotype of a professional killer. Block has put together a story that is not your run-of-the-mill crime tale. It is original, thoroughly enjoyable, and entertaining.	2005-08-01

They recommend a bewildering variety of diets, megadoses of vitamins and minerals, herbs, extracts, and heaven knows what else, all guaranteed to make us healthy. Some even peddle the nonsense that they can stop, or even reverse, aging. <br />In contrast, Walter Willett's book is based on solid science, obtained by careful research involving, in some cases, more that 100,000 persons. There is no intuition here. The recommendations are based on facts. And mighty interesting facts they are. We see that the famous, heavy-on-carbohydrate  USDA food pyramid has little evidence to support its role in  health. Instead, it appears to support the income of the food industry. He presents his own pyramid, based on daily exercise and weight control. Sitting on this base are whole grain foods, vegetable oils, fruits, vagetables, nuts, legumes, fish, poultry, and eggs. At the top of his pyramid are small amounts of dairy products, and even smaller portions of red meat and carbohydrate. He presents evidence to support his pyramid, and the result is impressive. He leads us through things that we should know about fats, carbohydrates, proteins, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. We even get recipes. For me, a biochemist, the book's strong point is its lack of the unsustantiated claims that I see in so many of the popular books on nutrition. Walter Willett is one the persons best qualified to write an outstanding book on this subject, and the result is excellent.	2005-07-11

His style, words, and plots are top notch. What do you get in this story? You get a grim and gritty New York - home to Matt Scudder, ex-cop and private investigator. You get Scudder's desperate efforts to overcome his addiction to alcohol. And you get the story of Kim, a prostitute, who pays Scudder to tell Chance, her pimp, that she wants to leave the business. Next, she is slashed to death. The obvious suspect is Chance, but Scudder becomes convinced that Chance didn't kill her, and Chance pays Scudder to find the murderer. As Scudder investigates, and more murders occur, it becomes clear that Kim had unknowingly become involved with a group of violent criminals. A nice feature of the story is that Block gives you all of the clues to pretty-much solve the mystery. Otherwise, you must wait until the final pages. It is a great story. Little wonder that Block has won so many awards for his mystery writing.	2005-06-30

But there is no scientific evidence that we currently can stop the aging process in humans. Researchers have slowed aging in laboratory rats and mice by putting them on a near-starvation diet, and they have extended life spectacularly in worms (as much as five-fold) by manipulating certain longevity genes. But we do not have evidence that the vitamins, minerals, or herbs cited in the book can stop human aging. Researchers around the world are working on aging, and I have no doubt that they will be able to stop human aging, possibly by developing a drug that affects longevity genes in humans. If you can maneuver around the claims for stopping aging, there is much, useful information in this book on good nutrition from fruits, vegetables, proper fats, and a healthy lifestyle. These will help you live longer. Live long enough, and scientists will find a way to stop you from aging.	2005-06-23

This latest installment is no exception. I had a difficult time putting the book down. The main difference in 4th of July is that it mostly concerns only one of the club members, Lieutenant Lindsay Boxer of the San Francisco Police Department. She gets into a shoot-out with two, gun-toting  children of a wealthy doctor. Wounded by the kids, she returns fire and kills one. The doctor files a lawsuit against Lindsay and the Police Department. His attorneys paint Lindsay as an irresponsible murderer. To escape a media circus, she retreats to her sister's house in picturesque Half Moon Bay, but immediately runs into a series of brutal murders. As she helps the local police, she becomes a target, leading to a surprising solution of the murders. The book has Patterson's characteristic, short chapters (145 in all) with snappy endings, and I found it to be a thoroughly enjoyable story.	2005-06-13

In this one, she uses Ford's Theatre as her site. Anyone who has visited Ford's Theatre will agree that she picked a place with the right atmosphere for a mystery. Someone murdered Nadia Zarinski in the alley behind Ford's Theatre. She was an intern for Senator Bruce Lerner, and there are rumors of an affair, so he is a suspect. The murder also casts an unwanted spotlight on Clarise Emerson, Lerner's former wife, head of the Ford's Theatre Society, and presidential nominee to chair the National Endowment for the Arts. Aging actor Sydney Bancroft claimed that Jeremiah Lerner, son of the Senator and Clarise, had been dating the victim. A surly brat, he ran when confronted by detectives, and was soon arrested for the murder. Clarise begs law professor Mac Smith to help her son. Mac and wife Annabel, an urbane couple, are in many of Margaret Truman's mysteries. Mac agrees to help, and the real mystery unfolds until it reaches a surprising climax. This is a splendid tale, with real characters (not cardboard) and a nice pace.	2005-05-31

Having said that, I can say that this \\"International Thriller of the Year\\" did not thrill me. It has Patterson's short chapters and nonstop action, but its resemblance to his earlier books stops there. It has a painfully-predictable plot, an unbelievable protagonist, and an ending that deteriorates into political babble. Nora Sinclair is a serial killer and the most interesting thing in the book. John O'Hara is an FBI agent in pursuit of Nora, but he has no resemblance to any FBI agent that I have known. They are smart. He is stupid. The story plods along with him doing one foolish thing after another. Toward the end, I was rooting for Nora to rid the FBI of this embarrassment, but it didn't happen. If you are stuck for hours in an airport, this story might pass the time for you, but I hope that Patterson will fire O'Hara and bring us more of his genuine thrillers.	2005-04-29

John Keller's profession is hit man. His agent, Dot, screens applicants for his services, negotiates the price (always high), and sends him out to do a quick, efficient job. Between jobs, he lives quietly in New York City, where he collects stamps, attends art shows, serves on a jury, and has an occasional love affair. He also talks with Dot frequently, treating us to dialog between two New Yorkers. Reading it, I snicker, chuckle, and sometimes dissolve in laughter. Block is that good. When hints appear that a hit man is stalking Keller, things get tense. This is a thoroughly enjoyable story, told with wit and verve.	2005-04-18

Although the situation is worse for black men, it also happens to white men, and woe to a teacher, black or white, male or female, accused by an unhappy student of sexual impropriety. Even if the accused are miraculously found to be not guilty, their lives are ruined. We must protect victims, but we must also not convict people on unsustantiated accusations.  <br />     In Railroaded, Whitfield Grant brings us this problem in all of its horror. A black man, a professional football player, is accused of rape by the white daughter of the team's owner. Here, we have an extreme case. The accused is a devoted family man. The accuser is a spoiled brat. She manufactures a plot to implicate the black man, and her father uses his millions to support her, legally and illegally. But the black man is popular with football fans, highly intelligent, and has the support of capable friends, so we have a clash of Titans. The story begins with the accusation, proceeds to a trial, and ends as a thriller. <br />     My only criticism is that the writing tends to tell us things, rather than to show them. But the author has picked a powerful subject and given us a powerful story that is well-worth reading.	2005-03-15

It is stored in a secure facility at a small biotech company in Scotland. Terrorists want the virus for mass murder, so they offer big money to three criminals to steal it. The criminals get into the lab by paying the sleazy son of the company's owner, who thinks that they are only going to steal a harmless drug. They steal the virus, but an immense snowstorm buries Scotland, and things get difficult for the thieves, for the police, and for the company owner's family. <br />     If you are looking for a nail-biting, fast-moving story, you will be disappointed. The tale proceeds leisurely, almost as if it is making its way through deep snow. Strangely, I couldn't get all worked up about a virus this deadly. I think it was because I was faced with too many chapters of soap-opera details about the company owner's family. Still, this is a nice story that will keep you reading, even if it is not up to the level of Follett's magnificent Eye of the Needle, or Jackdaws, or Hornet Flight.	2005-03-01

But rumors persist that some people saw a fiery track rise from the ocean and hit the airliner. On July 17, 2001, John Corey and Kate Mayfield, husband and wife, and both members of the FBI's Anti-Terrorist Task Force, attend a memorial sevice for the people that died in the tragedy. They are disturbed by the many reports of a missile, so they launch an off-hours investigation into the reports. This gets strong orders from their bosses to stop, but they continue, and we see them slowly uncover fact after fact, as they move closer to the truth and to mortal danger for themselves. The last quarter of the book becomes very intense, and Demille makes the best choice for a climax, although he passes up a chance to make the ending more exciting. Night Fall is not as exciting as Demille's The Lion's Game, but it is well-worth reading.	2005-02-07

As usual, James Patterson does a splendid job of grabbing you on the first pages and taking off with you at breakneck speed. It has Patterson's short chapters - really scenes - that keep the pace going. Here, we again have Alex Cross, formerly a detective with the DC police and now a member of the FBI. Cross is no cardboard character. We know his strengths and weaknesses from Patterson's careful development in a series of books. We again have the Wolf, an epic criminal and terrorist. The Wolf threatens to destroy major cities, such as New York, London, and Paris, if nations do not pay a huge sum of money to him. To show that he is serious, the Wolf has his minions (He has plenty of those.) destroy a Nevada town after evacuating the inhabitants. He then destroys an English town without evacuating its people. This sets Alex Cross and his fellow agents on a twisting, turning pursuit of the Wolf, in which the Wolf can turn on them at any time, with murderous results. Despite too many twists at the end, I found the story to be entirely enjoyable, as Patterson gives us the old razzle-dazzle throughout the book.	2005-01-12

This one involves Washington's Union Station. We see crowds of famous and not famous moving through the station under the watchful eye of Joe Jenks, bootblack. Louis Russo, a hit man, arrives at Union Station after a flight from Israel, where he has been hidden by the US witness protection program after he testified against his bosses in the Mafia. Waiting for him is Richard Marienthal, a writer, whose forthcoming book is based on Russo's claim that he murdered a foreign leader under orders from the White House. Before Russo can meet Marienthal, Russo is murdered in the station, and his killer is soon murdered also. It looks like a payback from the Mafia for a squealer, but is it? Soon, Marienthal and those around him are in grave danger, and the story proceeds to a surprising and very satisfactory ending. Unlike what we see in many novels, Margaret Truman gives substance to her characters, which adds to a believable plot. I have read several of her novels, and this is the best that has come along.

I spent many weeks reading it because each page had a new wonder that set my imagination churning. Valerie Kirschenbaum's thesis is that books have not changed much since Gutenberg and are presented to us in blocks of black type on a white page. While books have remained this way, technology has taken us into dazzling, computer graphics, video games, multimedia, and much more. Why can't books present their stories with color and graphics to create mood, excite the reader, or bring a surprise with the turning of a page? To try it in a simple form, I had my computer use different colors and styles of print and different-colored backgrounds to express mood and action in a few pages from one of my books. Even without graphics, the result knocked my socks off. Kirschenbaum is certainly onto something here. This may well be the wave of the future. <br />That is the serious part of this book. There is also a fun part, and you see it while you read it. Each new page holds treasures that entertain, educate, and tweak your imagination. The quotations and graphics are superb.

I like most books that I read, so it is a rare experience to find one that seems to have no redeeming value. What will you find if you read this story? First, you will not find a plot. Someone murders an Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court, but nothing much happens until the author gives us a dull, improbable ending. Second, the dialog is unbelievable. Listen to people in conversation around you. Each person's speech has a distinctive voice. Most writers spend huge amounts of time learning to write exciting dialog. Not so with this book. The characters all sound the same. Finally, the author throws in an extra story, a sappy tale about ghosts that appears to have no connection to the main story. This is the first of Coulter's books that I have read. Perhaps her other books are wonderful, but until someone persuades me that they are, this will be the last one that I read.

He works for the government, supposedly testing water samples that he collects from the Everglades, a place that he hates because it is inhabited by animals and insects. His real employer, however, is Red Hammernut, a wealthy farmer who dumps tons of contaminants into the Everglades, slowly killing it. Hammernut gets away with his crime because Chaz falsifies his tests to show that Red is dumping pure water. It works fine until Chaz suspects that his wife, Joey, has seen his fake results. He invites her on a romantic cruise and pushes her overboard. But he forgets that she was a champion swimmer in college. With the help of a floating bale of pot, she survives until she is picked up by Mick Stranahan, a retired police officer.

Afterward, I decided to visit London's Whitechapel district, scene of the murders. Maybe it was the blackout and fog, but the place was creepy. I got the same, creepy feeling from reading Cornwell's book. She is a master  writer, and here she intertwines sinister pictures of nights in Whitechapel with analytical findings from a modern forensics laboratory. The London police in 1888 never caught Jack the Ripper, although he wrote letters taunting them. Many men have been suggested to be the murderer, but the results of Cornwell's study point to Walter Sickert(1860-1942), an artist known for his dark paintings. As a scientist, I found the DNA evidence to be especially noteworthy. It showed that the saliva from the backs of stamps on letters from Walter Sickert was 99% likely to be the same as saliva from stamps on letters posted by Jack the Ripper. Cornwell puts together a good case for a mystery more than 100 years old. The book combines the feeling of the late 1800's with depictions of the murders and with forensic analysis in a very readable book.	2004-08-23

As a scientist, I was aware of nanotechnology, but I thought Crichton was stretching it a bit, until the latest issue of Science landed in my mailbox with a multipage discussion of rapid advances in nanotechnology. Thus, Prey is a great piece of suspense based on a fast-moving area of science. The plot is simple. Jack Forman, an unemployed,  computer expert suspects that his wife, a vice president of a high-tech firm, is having an affair. He gets an urgent call to consult with the same firm, and the suspense begins. The company has developed microscopic particles, half-machine and half-living matter, for covert, military observation. But the nanoparticles have gotten loose, swarmed, and learned to survive by feeding on animals or humans. The company, located in the desert, becomes besieged by the particles. Things get worse in a satisfying manner. My only criticism is that Crichton felt the need to intersperse explanations of nanotechnology throughout the story, interrupting its flow. But that is a small problem in an exciting tale that is well-worth reading.	2004-08-02

Laura Hillenbrand's wonderful story conveys this, as well as the excitement that racing fans feel when horses round the turn and charge into the homestretch. More than that, she describes beautifully the heart and soul of a remarkable horse. Seabiscuit didn't look like a champion, but he had heart, hustle, a perverse sense of humor, and he could run like the wind. His owner, his trainer, and his jockey saw what he had, and he took them to such dazzling heights in 1938 that he became more famous than world leaders. Laura Hillenbrand has done an outstanding job of tracing the career of this magnificent horse. Reading her story is pure enjoyment.	2004-07-13

Hurricanes are deadly, but quiet hurricane seasons in the past decade have given coastal residents a sense that hurricanes won't hit them. But they will. I survived two hurricanes, and they were pure horror. They were Category One hurricanes, the weakest kind, but they tore off roofs and smashed property like gigantic maniacs.<br />Robert Mykle's fine book describes a Category Four hurricane that came ashore near Palm Beach in 1928. A Category One hurricane causes some damage, while a Category Five causes complete destruction, so you can imagine the strength of a Category Four. But destruction didn't stop at the coast. The hurricane moved inland to rip into the farming communities at the south end of Lake Okeechobee, 40-50 miles inland from Palm Beach. Winds of 150 miles-per-hour and more than 12 inches of rain destroyed almost everything in its path, and killed some 2000 people. The real cost of this disaster is the effect on its victims, and Mykle introduces us to many of the doomed families as they go about their business, not knowing that the day after tomorrow will be their last on earth. We come to care about them. We mourn those killed and feel the suffering of survivors in the aftermath. This is a great strength of the book, and Robert Mykle has done a terific job of presenting a harrowing story in human terms. It is well worth reading.	2004-05-31

He gave us a grand picture of an earth-shaking event. In the case of The Tristan Betrayal, we meet Stephen Metcalfe, American secret agent, using the cover of an Argentine playboy to gather intelligence in German-occupied Paris during World War Two. But his cover is blown and his cell members killed. He has to get out of Paris, so he is sent to Moscow to try to use the love of his life, a Russian ballerina, to feed false information to the Germans to influence them to attack the Soviet Union and bring it into the war on the side of the allies. Again, his cover is blown, and he escapes to Berlin. Unfortunately, the story has a continuous set of death-threatening situations that face Metcalfe with monotonous regularity, and a set of improbable escapes each time. It reminds me of a James Bond novel, but Metcalfe is not as clever as Bond. Having said all this, I recommend the book if you are going on a long flight, or other boring activity, because the action never stops, and it will keep your attention.	2004-04-27

Rumors swirl about suicide because of impending disclosure of illegal activity with a billionaire supporter or sexual harrasment charges by a secretary. But the medical examiner finds that it is not suicide. It is murder. As suspects are eliminated, the FBI finds that hired killers, members of the Russian mafia, are loose in Washington. But for whom do they work? When suspicion turns to the man controlling the killers, the story becomes intense, as the suspect uses his hired killers to protect himself. All in all, it is a good story, and you get the usual, wonderful insight into Washington.	2003-10-06

He stood head and shoulders above other reporters in World War Two. He was in the thick of battles, shoulder to shoulder with the troops. More than that, he saw war through the eyes of individual soldiers. He shows us their human side while they do a dirty job, and he gives them dignity that they richly deserve. If you haven't been in combat, you haven't a clue as to what it is like, but Ernie Pyle's words come closer to a realistic picture of the many facets of war than anything else I have read. Here Is Your War begins on a ship carrying inexperienced, American troops to the invasion of North Africa in November, 1942. Through Pyle's eyes, we follow their landing at Oran, their pounding and defeats by the Germans as they struggle eastward, the bitter battles in Tunisia, and final victory in the Spring of 1943. If you are in combat long enough, you will die, and it happened to Ernie Pyle on Okinawa in the Spring of 1945. But he left us memorable words about war, such as those in this book. It is well worth reading.	2003-09-23

Ken Follet is a master of World War Two thrillers. In this tale, the Germans are shooting down British night bombers so readily that it threatens the survival of the British war effort. British intelligence deduces that the Germans have a new way to track British bombers, but they have not been able to identify it. It falls to Harald Olufsen, an eighteen year-old physics student in German-occupied Denmark to stumble across a secret, German installation near his home that looks like a collection of bed springs. He deduces that it is a new sort of antenna system and tells his older brother, Arne, about it. Harald doesn't know that Arne gathers information for the British. Arne suspects that the Germans and Danish police are after him, so he reluctantly asks Harald to slip into the German installation and photograph the antennas. As the Germans learn of the photos and close off all escape routes, it seems impossible to get them to England. The only possiblity is a damaged Hornet Moth biplane belonging to the family of his friend, Karen. As the Germans and Danish police close in, Harald works frantically to get it to fly. The suspense is great throughout the story, the characters are believable, and the plot twists to overcome repeated barriers all make sense. This is another outstanding book by Ken Follet.	2003-09-02

In the summer of 1954, two US Marshalls, Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule, ride the ferry to Shutter Island, off Boston Harbor. The island is the site of a hospital for the most dangerous of the criminally insane. The Marshalls are there to investigate the escape of Rachel Solando, a child murderer. Somehow, she got away through locked doors and past a whole staff of orderlies and guards. This raises Teddy's suspicions about a staff that seems more strange by the hour. Things become intense when an unexpected hurricane isolates the island from the mainland. So there you have it: murderous maniacs, creepy staff, and a howling hurricane. The plot could go in all sorts of directions, but Lehane chooses a startling tack that makes the story well worth reading. As it develops, it is like watching a photo come apart and dissolve in water. Then, Lehane hits you with an astonishing climax, followed by a final twist. It's a different and thoroughly ejoyable tale.	2003-08-08

Instead, the police take him from his hotel to the Louvre, where he finds the curator murdered. He is stunned to find that all evidence points to him as the murderer of a man he had never met. But Sophie Neveu, a police cryptographer and granddaughter of the curator, shocks Langdon further by maneuvering him into escaping from the police. On the run, she explains that she does not believe that he murdered her grandfather. The curator was the head of a secret society that dated back to the time of Christ and protected a great secret. She wants to find the secret. Pursued by police, they soon find that they are also pursued by the murderers. To their astonishment, they find that the secret they seek is nothing less than the Holy Grail. Their breathtaking flight extends from France to London and on to its climax in Scotland. Brown's ending of his story is less than thrilling, but the chase, which occupies most of the book, is well worth reading.	2003-07-14

You put on a uniform, and you are automatically a hero. Here is a thrilling story about a group of genuine heroes. It is April, 1942. In the four months since the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States has suffered a series of stunning defeats and lost many of its Pacific bases. To counter the seeming invincibility of Japan, Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle leads sixteen, twin-engine B-25 bombers from the deck of an aircraft carrier to bomb targets in Japan. They cause consternation in Japan, but a longer flight than planned and bad weather cause the bombers to crash in China. Some flyers are captured and executed by the Japanese, some are killed, and many are injured. Their escape from capture by the Japanese is an epic of courage and amazing help by Chinese peasants. The story is as thrilling today as it was when first published in 1943, and it is well worth reading.	2003-05-08

A constant source of fascination to me was the ingenious route taken by the builders of our nation's first transcontinental railroad. The Union Pacific built westward from Omaha. The Central Pacific built eastward from Sacramento. Since the railroads got money from Congress according to how much track they laid, it was an all-out race. Stephen Ambrose describes how the Union Pacific had an easy time across Nebraska, more difficult across Wyoming, and very difficult through the Wasatch Range in Utah. The Central Pacific performed miracles to build over Donner Pass in the Sierras, but then moved rapidly across Nevada and Utah. They met in Promontory Valley north of Great Salt Lake. Both railroads performed astounding feats of engineering, and Ambrose's story is at its best when describing them. I wish that there were detailed maps of the many regions. The few maps in the book look like they were drawn by a fifth-grader. The story, however, gets bogged down in financial details that detract from the exciting tale of the building and could have been addressed more briefly. This is not as good a book as Band of Brothers or Ambrose's earlier, fine books. I get the feeling that it was put together quickly, but it still has some vintage Ambrose and should keep you interested.	2003-04-28

Your commander can order you to sacrifice your life to achieve an objective. You may be ordered to hold off the enemy so your fellow soldiers can escape, or you may be ordered to dive your bomber into an impossible hail of gunfire, but you are expendable. Such was the case for the six 70-foot speedboats of the US Navy's Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three. They were part of the Navy's tiny Far Eastern Fleet in the Philippines when the Japanese attacked with overwhelming force in 1941. It was soon clear that the Philippines would be lost, and the remains of the fleet went to Australia, leaving MTB Squadron Three to help the doomed soldiers on Bataan hold off the Japanese Army for as long as possible. After losing boat after boat in suicidal attacks on Japanese cruisers and destroyers, the remaining boats carried General MacArthur, his wife, his son, and assorted generals and admirals on a perilous trip to the southern Philippines for escape by air to Australia. MTB Squadron Three lost its remaining boats in further attacks on the Japanese and prepared to fight as infantry against the oncoming juggernaut. But four of the officers were ordered to get out on the last planes to leave the Philippines. William L. White, in a magnificent piece of writing, lets the survivors tell their story. It is certainly one of the best stories ever written of World War Two.	2003-04-16

Each gives us a mystery plus a sense of the White House and popular culture during the Roosevelt administration in the 1930-1940 era. In this story, it is 1943. The allies and the axis powers are fighting desperately around the world. Winston Churchill and his Generals have come to the White House secretly to plan the invasion of France. But upstairs, a policeman finds the body of one of the President's aides, murdered in the Lincoln Bedroom. Realizing that this must be kept secret because of the conference, Eleanor Roosevelt sets out to solve the killing. With the aid of a Secret Service agent and a Washington Police detective, she uncovers and thwarts a plot to assassinate the President.

I thought that Jeff Shaara did a great job in Rise to Rebellion, the first book in this series, that began with the Boston Massacre and ended with the Declaration of Independence. In The Glorious Cause, we see the infant United States facing the might of a furious King George and an aroused British people. The Americans are ill-trained and ill-equipped, but they have two things going for them - their determination and their military leader, George Washington. He is the dominant figure in Shaara's picture of the revolution. I think we sometimes forget how great this man was, but he was every bit as great as most Americans regard him. Shaara protrays Washington's courage, his moral standards, his kindness, his sometime doubts in himself, and above all, his brilliance on the battlefield, where he successively outmaneuvered British Generals Howe, Clinton, and Cornwallis. We also see how the Americans used guerilla tactics to kill British soldiers at every opportunity all over the nation in bitter, little fights. Finally, the French make America's independence possible by supplying powerful aid to bring Cornwallis, and really the British Army, to defeat at Yorktown. In 638 pages, Jeff Shaara tells a fascinating and inspiring story.	2003-02-21

I agree. If a cat resides in your home, you learn quickly that communication with the cat is a two-way street. You communicate with the cat via words that the cat quickly picks up, and the cat communicates with you by sound and body language that sometimes takes a poor human considerable time to understand. That is why we need a book such as this one by Claire Bessant. Usually, while you are trying unsuccessfully to train the cat, that calculating cat is busily training you for maximum cat security and comfort. Bessant explains the basis for cat behavior and shows how body language aids vocal sounds in telling you what the cat wants to tell you. Her background information goes a long way toward helping you communicate with and understand a highly intelligent creature. I found this well-written book to be informative and entertaining.	2003-01-13

I like Alex Cross. Unlike the foul-mouthed, socially-dysfunctional detectives in so many novels, he is a gentle family man, and we hear almost as much about his family life as his detective work. Still, tension is with us throughout the story. In Four Blind Mice, we meet the psychotic killers early in the tale and follow their trail as they kill again and again. Some victims are persons the killers are paid to murder. Some victims just happen to get in the way, and women victims are killed for fun. The killers are three, former Special Forces assassins who get pleasure from killing. It's up to Alex Cross, his partner John Samson, and the FBI to catch these crazies, but it isn't easy because Army officers block the lawmen repeatedly. At the end, we learn the identity of the fourth blind mouse, the highly-placed person who orders the killings. The story proceeds at Patterson's usual breakneck speed and gets more tense as it continues. If you like thrillers, this is for you.	2002-12-16

For centuries, smallpox was the world's leading cause of death, and even survivors were left horribly disfigured. We got rid of it by vaccination, but kept two stocks, one in Russia and one in the United States. Now, most of the world's population is no longer immune to smallpox, and news media are full of worries of some group stealing smallpox and unleashing it upon us. Ludlum and Shelby constructed a scenario in which a combine of high-ranking American and European military, industrial, and government zealots steal smallpox from Russia and develop it into a terible weapon, able to kill in minutes. Russian and American operatives work together to try to track down the culprits and destroy the smallpox before it is too late. You know the identity of the bad guys early on, but that doesn't stop the story from building tension right up to the end.	2002-11-15

They are low-key, have a minimum of gory details, and have twists to keep things interesting. This time, we have the murder of a Canadian diplomat and destruction of three commuter planes in flight, killing passengers and crew. We watch the investigation of the crimes through the eyes of a Washington Post reporter, a CIA operative, and several FBI agents. Simultaneous destruction of three planes points to terrorists, but which terrorists? When the CIA man and the reporter find the answer, the story shifts into high gear during the last 100 pages for a breathtaking ending. All in all, it's an enjoyable book for relaxation.	2002-10-30

It's also shocking, so be prepared. Dr. Catherine Cordell is a trauma surgeon in a Boston Hospital. She is extremely conscious of her security because several years earlier, while she was at Emory University in Georgia, a serial killer was entering womens' bedrooms, tying them, and performing surgery on them without anesthesia. When he had inflicted maximum pain, he killed them. One night, a resident visited her, supposedly to discuss his poor work. Instead, he drugged her with Rohypnol, and she awoke to find herself tied to her bed while he prepared for surgery on her. She got a hand free, grabbed a pistol from under her bed and shot him. Case closed. But now, someone is killing women the same way in Boston, and the killer knows things that were never made public. It soon becomes clear that Catharine Cordell is the fiend's ultimate target. This story has so much suspense that it is hard to put it down. The plot is clever, and the book is thoroughly enjoyable.	2002-10-10

We can laugh at his hilarious descriptions, and we can cry at how close they are to the truth. Remember the election of 2000, and how we came back and messed up again in the primary election of 2002? Typical. In the story, Marlon Conrad is your usual sleazy politician and a shoo-in for election as Governor until he serves with his army reserve unit in the Balkans and learns about people. He starts talking about issues and helping Florida's citizens. That does it. The whole political machine goes after him, with at least five killers trying to assassinate him. The characters are loopy. The situations are bizarre, and the book is downright funny. It's well worth reading.	2002-10-01

You have always stood for high principles, but while you are traveling in Europe, the bloodthirsty dictator of Peru accuses you of violating the international treaty against torture. He demands your arrest and immediate extradition to Peru, where a show trial will result in your execution. By international agreement, all nations must arrest you. You are in the air between Athens and Rome. Thanks to Peru's clever, British attorney, police will be waiting for you at any place that you land. What do you do? That is the problem faced by former Republican president John Harris in this nonstop thriller. While the president's attorney fights desperately against huge odds, the pilot of the airliner on which Harris rides maneuvers equally desperately to try to keep Harris from being arrested, but he can't stay in the air forever.

Long-time Las Vegas resident Jimmy Delaney owns a bar that is a happy hangout for locals. But things aren't running Jimmy's way. His exwife hates him. His brother-in-law, acting as his accountant, runs off with all of Jimmy's money, and the IRS is about sell his bar for taxes that his accountant failed to pay.

Thus, he meets Amaris, the Dice Angel, a weird character even for Las Vegas, and a wild ride begins.

Everyone was curious about the person who had come from nowhere to make, along with Francis Crick, one of the great discoveries of the twentieth century. I found him to be very bright, friendly, and bubbling with ideas. Genes, Girls, and Gamow describes the ferment in biology at that time, and his attempts to apply intuition to the problem of how information in DNA translates into proteins. But much of the book is a candid account of his search for the perfect girl to marry. We go through his attempts to woo a string of CalTech girls - all failures. I once suggested to a pretty, intelligent lab assistant that he would be a good catch, since he was sure to get a Nobel prize. She gave me a look that would have frozen melted steel, so I kept silent after that. The account of his pursuit of undergraduate student Christa Mayr is almost painful to read, since he loves her, but she is only lukewarm. It all comes out well, however, when he finally finds the girl of his deams. The third part of the book's title, the physicist George Gamow, flits in and out of the story in the same way that he would appear at CalTech and then disappear. The book reminds me a bit of The Diary of Samuel Pepys, since we read where Watson went, with whom, and what they discussed. If you would like to read an insider story of the way that much of our current biology developed explosively in the 1950's, this story gives you a month by month diary. Jim Watson's candor makes it fascinating reading.	2002-08-14

Sloane Ryder is a New York financial analyst. She stumbles across dirty financial dealing in a major corporation and is fired and blacklisted for reporting it to the SEC. She despairs of finding a job, but is noticed and hired by a secret division of the General Accounting Office. It has detected some disturbing happenings involving the Chinese and high officials in the US government. Soon, with the help of Secret Servicewomen, Holland Tylo and Hollis Fremont, whom Shelby readers will recognize from previous books, an incredible plot emerges. The Chinese government intends to kill the American president and use the confusion as cover to conquer Taiwan. But as Sloane's unit closes in on the American traitors, the Handyman, a professional assassin hired by the Chinese, murders them. The action moves ever-faster to a breathtaking climax. This is a genuine thriller. I usually can put any book aside, no matter how thrilling, until I have time to read again, but I couldn't stop reading this one. Shelby has given us a first-rate story.	2002-08-01

In Midnight Runner, Kate swears vengance on the President and all who foiled her. In the weakest aspect of the plot, the President, with awesone power at his disposal, instead asks Daniel Quinn, a former American Special Forces sergeant, to investigate and derail the all-powerful Kate Rashid. When I read this in the early chapters, I thought, \\"Oh, no, not another John Wayne type defeating an army of bad guys with one hand. We've seen it in a hundred bad novels and movies.\\" But Higgins is too clever for such banality, and Quinn fizzles into ineffectiveness. It remains for our old friend, Sean Dillon, ex-IRA operative, now with a British spy agency, to go after Kate Rashid and her minions. She plans to bring down the American President by cutting off the major supply of oil to the United States. She also plans to murder everyone, including Sean Dillon, who helped kill her brothers. Dillon, together with his boss, General Ferguson, and other friends, stops her, but it's a big fight. There is plenty of action throughout the book, and the final chapters will keep you turning those pages.	2002-07-08

I hoped that Stephen Ambrose would use his excellent command of prose to describe the horror of those missions, whether in a B-24, B-17, Fifteenth Air Force in Italy, or Eighth Air Force in England. But it didn't happen. His description of combat is like sipping a glass of milk, when actual combat is like choking down a glass of tequila. It is probably asking too much of someone who wasn't there, but I didn't get the feeling of intense cold, frozen oxygen masks, altitude sickness, planes exploding around you, boys losing arms, legs, or heads, and men driven mad by fear. In four months of missions, my ten-man crew had five killed and two, including me, wounded. I lost so many friends that I stopped making friends because it hurt too much when I saw them die.<BR>   The book is mostly a story of former Senator George McGovern, as he trained and flew a B-24 on bombing missions at the end of the war against Germany. He apparently didn't have to face German fighters coming at him, but he flew many times through the awful box barrages of antiaircraft fire above German cities. I still don't know how any of us survived those.<BR>   The book has errors, but what book doesn't? Thus, I'll point out the first one, on the first page of Chapter One and let it go at that. He says, \\"They were all volunteers. The U.S. Army Air Corps - after 1942 the Army Air Forces - did not force anyone to fly.\\" That is nonsense. Four members of my crew were draftees, and many other combat crews contained draftees. I was headed for a nice, safe job as a ground-based officer, when the Air Force sneakily gave me a flight physical.<BR>   Still, it's an enjoyable book. It's low-key and will be welcome if you don't like to read about the blood and gore of combat. I particularly liked learning that, after eating canned Spam for months, a U.S. Senator and candidate for President of the United States grewto hate the stuff as much as I did.	2002-06-21

It is June, 1939. World War Two is only weeks away. During the pomp and ceremony of a visit by the King and Queen of England, a young assistant to Eleanor Roosevelt is found murdered. Investigation reveals that she is not the innocent girl that everyone assumed her to be. She was also seen at the German Embassy, and further tracking leads to the realization that murderous German spies have penetrated the White House. For fans of the series, this is a vintage Elliott Roosevelt mystery, with much fascinating insight into the 1939 White House by someone who was there. There is nothing here for the blood and gore violence fan - just a relaxing mystery peopled by Franklin Roosevelt, J. Edgar Hoover, Ernest Hemingway, and other notable figures of the time.	2002-06-03

I thought it was going to be a straightforward mystery, but that sly devil, Hiaasen, couldn't keep from being funny, and I laughed from beginning to end. The plot is simple. Jack Tagger, an aging, investigative reporter, is banished to writing obits for a south Florida newspaper when he humiliates the smarmy CEO of the newspaper chain. But he runs across the death of Jimmy Stoma, front man for the musical group, Jimmy and the Slut Puppies, under suspicious circumstances, and he romps off to investigate. Emma, his editor, tries to keep him in check, but he burrows into an increasingly smelly coverup of Stoma's death. As Tagger digs, Slut Puppies die like flies until he nails the murderer.

They're a relief from serial killers, blood and gore, and spooky things. In Murder in Havana, we are quite a distance into the story before we have a murder, and you will quickly put your finger on the likely murderer, but that's fine. The fun of this book is in the hazardous trip that ex-CIA agent Max Pauling takes to Havana. His assignment is to find whether an American pharmaceutical company is secretly trying to circumvent American law to make a deal with Fidel Castro for a cancer treatment. Max knows that you can't trust anyone, and he certainly can't in this story. He is soon in great peril and has to run for his life. The tale is more of an adventure than a mystery, but it has a nice feel of life in Castro's Cuba, and it will keep you turning the pages.	2002-04-05

The setting is France, just before D-Day. German communications from France to Germany pass through a huge telephone center in Sainte-Cecile.

The story opens during a failed attempt by British Major Felicity (Flick) Clairet and French Resistance fighters to destroy it. She escapes, but not before German Major Dieter Franck, a man capable of cruel torture, identifies her. As the days count down to D-Day, Flick leads five British women in a daring attempt to destroy the heavily-guarded telephone center, while she plays a desperate cat and mouse game with Franck and hundreds of Gestapo troops.

He made an incredible journey on foot to Los Angeles. Although most of the party died, those that survived until rescued named the place Death Valley. In this volume, Manley tells the story of the trapped party and his struggle to reach Los Angeles to get help. Settle down with the book and a good set of maps, and enjoy the tale told first-hand.	2001-09-26

In 1840, California was there to be settled, but how to cross the deserts and mountains to reach it? Beginning with the Bartelson Party in 1841, pioneers blazed ever-better trails that avoided deserts, followed water, and crossed the mountains, especially the forbidding peaks of the Sierras. But even though trails improved, they were still treacherous, as shown by the doomed Donner Party in 1846. We get a fascinating picture of the West, and Stewart even takes on a trip along the California Trail, from Independence, Missouri to Sacramento via Fort Laramie, Wyoming's South Pass, Nevada's Humboldt River, and over Donner Pass. If you enjoy travel or American history, you can spend many, pleasant hours with this book.	2001-09-25

It begins with a British soldier shivering in the cold outside Boston's Custom House in 1770. Before the night is out, the young soldier is in the midst of the Boston Massacre, and British subjects in the American colonies are on the road to revolution. As we travel the road, Shaara gives us fascinating views of John Adams and his fiery cousin Samuel, Ben Franklin, Joseph Warren, Thomas Jefferson, and finally the imposing figure of George Washington. We see them as humans with personal problems, doubts, and worries as they move down the dangerous path to rebellion. And we see the brutal British treatment that leads the colonies to revolution. The book ends with the Declaration of Independence, and you can almost hear the bells ringing as the colonies celebrate. It's a thoroughly-enjoyable book.	2001-09-24

Jean Shepherd recounts his early years in a steelmill and oil refinery town in northern Indiana. The time is the late 1930's to 1940's. There is a sensible mother, a good-hearted father with an incredible vocabulary of cuss words, and a younger brother with an amazing ability to whine. We begin with the arrival next door of the Bumpus family, slovenly hillbillies with a million dogs that send our hero's father into explosions of outrage. We go through disaster after disaster until we reach the ultimate when our hero takes Wanda Hickey to the high school prom. I laughed so hard that I difficulty reading. Shepherd's mastery of description of small-town America in the 1940's is a pleasure to read, and it never stops being outrageously funny.	2001-09-19

Her enemy is Alfred Vicary, a former history professor and seeming bumbler, but he is brighter than he seems, and he runs counterintelligence operations. Blake seems to have all the smarts to leave Vicary in the dust, but it's like the hare and the tortoise. Suspense builds as the tale progresses and the stakes become ever-higher.

In places, it could pass as a thriller. Little wonder that this book was made into the exciting movie, Gettysburg. Shaara made this important battle come alive. We see the principal characters - Lee, Meade, and Pickett. We feel their doubts and worries. But the hero of Shaara's story is Colonel Joshua Chamberlain, a former college professor from Maine. Soft-spoken and seemingly out of place in the war's carnage, he knows most of the soldiers in his regiment. But when the chips are down, he and his Maine volunteers hold the left flank of the Union line in one of the most thrilling battles of the war. The book is terrific.	2001-09-05

As he did in Jurassic Park, Crichton makes the science upon which he bases the story seem so logical. If you don't look at it too closely, you're hooked. Using quantum technology, a corporation can send people through time, but a history professor who traveled back to fourteenth century France got stuck there. A team travels back to rescue him. Once they are there, the story becomes a rip-roaring adventure in medieval France. It's a tale that will keep you turning the pages.	2001-08-30

It chronicles three generations of the MacIvey family, beginning with Tobias MacIvey's arrival in Florida in 1858 and ending with Solomon MacIvey's realization in 1968 that much of the original Florida is gone. In that time span, the MacIveys suffer through tragedy and bask in success, as the family rises from poverty to great wealth. The book's strongest characteristic is Patrick Smith's ability to describe the Florida that was - the Florida before developers and retirees and rockets and theme parks. I'm not certain that the Florida pictured so well by Patrick Smith exists anywhere in today's Florida, but it makes wonderful reading.	2001-08-29

For many years, Doctor Louis Camuti tended an amazing variety of cats in New York City, owned by a more amazing variety of famous artists, authors, Broadway and motion picture stars, producers, and executives. His insight into the owners is sometimes jucier than his insight into their cats (which is considerable). Along the way, he tells us useful facts. Cats are not fussy eaters, for example. They just try to outfox their owners into paying a fortune for fancy food. It's a thoroughly enjoyable and relaxing book. My cat gave it five sniffs, a high rating indeed.	2001-08-27

There is something of the Titanic in reading of their descent toward death. They could have survived one mistake, but they made many. They started late to cross the country. They moved slowly. Taking bad advice, they had to blaze a new route through the Wasatch Mountains. They came apart trying to cross the desert west of Great Salt Lake. Finally reaching the eastern slope of the Sierra Range, they rested too long and were trapped by deep snows at the crossing we now call Donner Pass. Their subsequent starvation and cannibalism gets most attention when you hear about the Donner party, but the real story is what happens when well-meaning people make mistakes, due to lack of knowledge. There is also tremendous heroism as families try to survive and rescuers from California try to reach the marooned people. Stewart tells a masterful story.	2001-08-24

Cats love security. They love a familiar setting. They like a routine, but they can become bored if we don't play with them regularly. The author has fine suggestions on effective play. She also has excellent thoughts on how cats try to communicate with us. It took me a long time to figure out what my cat was trying to tell me, but you can get it nicely from this book. The volume has useful information on cat health, but its great value is in helping you think like a cat. Every cat owner would be wise to have a copy.	2001-07-31
