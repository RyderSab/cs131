Books	5	18	18	N	N	Guidebook Into the Unknown	Victoria Lynn Weston takes readers into uncharted regions in her innovative guidebook into the unknown.  \\"Akashic Who's Who: of Psychics, Mediums, Healers and More! gives a well-rounded over view of the possibilities in the psychic world.  Weston's presentation is clear and precise.  Being that she is a well-respected psychic in her own right, she knows just the right questions to ask during her interviews--in the process, she reveals well-kept trade secrets to her readers.  She is generous in this book as well, going far beyond interviews, presenting some of the nitty-gritty information we all want to know about readings, psychics, various styles of divination, different approaches, protocol for contacting psychics and as the title suggests, so much more!  I highly recommend this book, giving it two thumbs way up.  Consider it a gift that just keeps giving.  If you are interested in the unknown, run, don't walk--buy a copy of this book and then pass it on to someone still in the dark about these matters!!	2005-09-12

Written in a very concise way, \\"The Way of the Elders\\" contains the wise voice of an African proverb.  The no-nonsense, easy to relate to style the couple uses is inviting and does a great deal to put West African Spiritual tradition in perspective amidst other traditions of indigenous people around the world.  The topic itself, West African Spirituality and Traditions, is immense and only beginning to be told by various authors.  I have a feeling there is a lot more lurking under the surface of this book.  I hope in future books the Doumbia's will be able to share and reveal more about the fascinating Bamana, Fulani,and Wolof cultures.	2005-03-18

As an advanced practitioner I felt a desire for less defined structure and more ideas to incorporate into my magical year.  This is a good book for those who need total structure because there is not a lot of wiggle room for inserting your own ideas or beliefs.  Sandra Kynes is a fine writer with a very concise, somewhat elfish style that is endearing.  At the back of the book there is even a glossary and some pronunciations for elfish words, which is a really nice touch.	2005-03-18

Anyone who studies Pan-African religions, comparative religion, African mythology and folklore or alternative spirituality, as well as those engaged in Caribbean studies will find \\"Creole Religions of the Caribbean\\" of great interest.  There is no need to languish in mystery on these topics with such a solid piece of research as this on hand to resource.

Shafton goes further to create a clear picture of how African and by extension, African American dreams are distinctive from the way other cultures dream.  \\"Dream-singers\\" gives voice to the practices of our ancestors--practices that heretofore have gone largely undocumented.  \\"Dream-singers\\" situates dreams in the real world of our community, showing how they mirror our spiritual world view.  Hats off to Anthony Shafton for \\"Dream-singers: The African American Way with Dreams.\\"  This book enhances the understanding of dreams in general and the spell dreams hold on the African American community in particular. \\"Dream-singers\\" is a useful work of nonfiction for people from a variety of fields and backgrounds; enriching conversation and point of view for all.  Therapists, nurses, doulas and other support personnel will find that this book creates an especially clear window through which they can understand the unique ways dreams shape the perspective, fears, hopes and vision of many people of African descent.  Highly recommended to those who work with dreams.	2005-02-17

As a person of African descent I find it incredibly enriching to read the stories of Yaya Diallo as retold by Mitch Hall regarding his upbringing in the musical culture of the Miniaka (Bamana) people.  We are all lucky that Diallo's words are preserved by Hall in \\"The Healing Drum\\" because a great deal of healing wisdom of Africa is oral, passed through families, thus it remains secretative.  I welcome this open-hearted effort and openminded collaborative work seeking to contribute to international healing through authentic sound, as such I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking knowledge of alternate ways of healing inspired by West African spirituality.	2005-02-17

The book highlights Jamaican healing methods but also discusses its connections to other forms of healing in the African diaspora and elsewhere.  The only thing readers might have to get past is the dry writing style--once you get past the lackluster presentation, there is much to learn.

The book reviews some of the best literature in the field of ethnomedicine of African Americans but then opens the door to new ways of perceiving the research.  The amulet section and healer's interviews are unique--a wonderful contribution to understanding African American magico-spiritual healing techniques as they relate back to West Africa.

Moreover, the calendar is filled with useful information not presented in this manner elsewhere.  The problem with the calendar (quite a huge problem) is the layout.  The calendar is jam packed with information, crammed together in a tiny font, single spaced, with no visual breaks.  Only the most dedicate reader with 20/20 vision will be able and willing to decipher the text of this calendar.  This calendar is all about the text so having a readable layout it critical to it being of any use.  Moreover, the photographs are not in full color but rather one color.  This makes for a bland if not boring presentation of otherwise intriguing imagery.  Based on concept alone I went ahead and bought several of these calendars as gifts but before the year was over I threw mine away since I can't read it.  My advice to the publisher is to realize that calendars are visual and not just informative.  Go ahead and spring for an art director or a freelance graphic designer, then your calendar will be able to reach all of the people it should.	2004-11-17

This is probably why I give this a generous 3 stars instead of the 1 star it deserves.  The concept of a young girl named (of all things) Susie Salmon, writing from her own personal heaven was an immediate draw.  Alice Sebold's approach to the story is creative, usual and quirky.  \\"Lovely Bones\\" starts off well enough, the pace is good; the characters and setting are fleshed out well.  Of course, most any reader would be saddened by the quick death of the protagonist but then again, that is the author's choice.  What bothers me the most about \\"Lovely Bones\\" is that there is never a release from the initial sadness.  The outlook of \\"Lovely Bones\\" goes from bad to worse.  Many of the main characters slowly fall apart--the ones that do okay are minor.  Most disappointing is that even the \\"bad guy\\" just quietly slips away, in terms of the storyline, when at first he and avenging his actions was the major focus. I agree with other reviewers in terms of the ending--it is useless and nonsensical but I won't spoil this for those who want to read the book. I can say that I was left with the impression that Sebold herself just sort of slipped out of the story towards the end into the sunset, along with Mr. Harvey, the murderer, perhaps the story even depressed her.  After such a great premise and beginning, in the end \\"Lovely Bones\\" left me sad, cold and very disappointed.  I didn't see anything much that was lovely about \\"Lovely Bones.\\"	2004-09-03

After reading the few negative reviews I became worried that the large text and rather sad love story would get bogged down, becoming difficult to read.<br /><br /> Instead, I treasured every page, wishing the book would continue on even further than it does. Audrey Niffenegger is a truly inspired author and gifted storyteller with an innovative style and voice. &quot;The Time Traveler's Wife&quot; crosses many genres, sci-fi, romance, adventure, and of course elements of travel. As a long time Chicago resident familiar with the streets, neighborhoods and cultural centers that form the backdrop of the story I can say Niffenegger does a superb job of bringing these places to life within her story. The style is confident, her voice is strong and the story is so peculiar that in parts in comes close to suggesting elements of the horror genre. The lead characters come from different worlds socially as well as the more obvious differences they have with age, values, time and space. Henry is from a family of gifted musicians with a modest income, living in a Chicago two-flat. Whereas the artistic Clare is from a well-to-do family who divides their time between the resort of South Haven, Michigan and Chicago. The diverse texture of Henry and Clare's characters and upbringing adds drama, intrique and an edge to the story. The cover and beginning of the book evokes a sense of pedophilia which I found very disturbing but the story deftly moves the reader from such dark thoughts into the light, through the complex changes Henry (the time traveler) goes through during his life. &quot;The Time Traveler's Wife&quot; has a well composed cast of numerous characters who work well to reinforce the story. Many issues are raised including the juggling of art (or any profession/passion)with motherhood; growing up and growing older along with friends, family and lover; the anguish of infertility; death and mourning; substance abuse; infidelity and the quest for independence. I am an avid reader--this is by far the best book I have read in months. Hats off to Audrey for her brilliant telling of a poignant, complex tale with plausibile realism and a healthy dose of fine artistry.f infertility; death and mourning; substance abuse; infidelity and the quest for independence.

Author Carly Wall, is a certified aromatherapist and long time student of the work of psychic Edgar Cayce; both interests meld beautifully in &quot;Scented Veil.&quot; The distinctive quality of this book that makes it stand out from the rather crowded field of aromatherapy texts is Wall's tight focus on the connection between scent and the psychic realm. Though a slim volume this book contains an impressive amount of specialized information. There are fascinating yet instructive chapters on how astral travel, meditation, out of body experiences, tranquility, lucid dreaming, divination, healing and even the kundalini flow of energy is enhanced by natural scents. A wide range of cultural orientations to the topic is presented from both the east and west--the information on Egyptian use of scent is excellent. The psychic development of the reader is nurtured throughout the book. The ultimate goal of &quot;Scented Veil&quot; seems to be the spiritual growth of the soul and enlightenment of the reader through connection to the psychic aspects of scents. I have done a great deal of research on aromatherapy and its connection to spirituality; &quot;Scented Veil&quot; is one of the best books recently written on this largely untapped topic.	2004-07-16

I was pleasantly surprised by the way Sue Monk Kidd handled both the characters and the topic.  There is no predictability in &quot;The Secret Life of Bees.&quot;  This is a unique picture of an eclectic group of people living in an unusual time of flux and change in America.  Just as there is a beautifully realized, sumptuous painting on the cover of the book, there is a simularly lush story contained within the covers.  Americans, Black, White, Red, Yellow or Tan are individuals first and we don't require cookie-cutter treatment in works of fiction.  I was drawn into the curious world of the Boatwright sisters and like the main character Lily, I didn't want to leave.  I am a specialist in alternative beliefs, woman's spirituality, African traditional beliefs and African diasporic folklore.  While for the most part I was completely unfamiliar with the rites, rituals, ceremonies and observances portrayed in &quot;The Secret Life of Bees,&quot; I applaud Sue Monk Kidd for using her creative gift to make it all plausible. Africans all across the diaspora have creatively blended beliefs from organized religion, be it Islamic, Catholic, Protestant or even Jewish faith into what was retained from their villages in Africa. I found the curious blend of Gnostic Catholicism and Gullah traditions to be as creative and innovative as I know my people have been, all across the globe, throughout history.  Another enjoyable feature of &quot;The Secret Life of Bees&quot; is that it is a book that works well as family reading.  I have heartily recommended &quot;The Secret Life of Bees&quot; to my children, their friends and my husband--there aren't many books that I would feel comfortable recommending in this way.  Sue Monk Kidd is a surprising, creative, gifted writer who brings life in the South, during the 60s into our collective consciousness, regardless of where we currently reside.  I look forward to the film version of the book--it is so richly textured and sensual that it screams--film!e South, during the 60s into our collective consciousness, regardless of where we currently reside.

This approach makes the book inviting to practitioners of various paths and orientations.  The style used by Teish in \\"Jambalaya\\" should be celebrated because African belief systems are as diverse as Africans and African descended people, rather than dubbed \\"New Age.\\"  The author is creative, her experience is rich and her writer's voice resonates.\\"Jambalaya: The Natural Woman's Book of Personal Charms and Practical Rituals\\" is a frequently visited book on my reference shelf, even though the pages are yellowing.  Whatever level or type of practitioner the reader is, no doubt \\"Jambalaya will be a book capable of feeding the soul throughout the years.	2004-03-03

The book is idiosyncratic and contains some flat-out fallacies, still it can be appreciated as a curiousity along with other metaphysical, alchemist and spiritual texts of long ago--nothing more or less.	2004-03-03

I enjoy the inclusion of various goddesses who can assist with magickal house work--especially the Roman goddess Vesta.  The spirit of \\"Simple Spells for Hearth and Home\\" is light and inspirational--the spells are easy to accomplish.  My only quibble with the book is shared with another reviewer--she constantly tries to \\"hard sell\\" the concept of using spells to people faithful to Judeo-Christianity.  There isn't a problem with this, since magickal books need not and indeed should not be exclusive.  I do however suspect that her core audience come from Earth-based paths (Wicca, Witchcraft, Hoodoo, Shamanism, etc) Dolnick's hard-sell routine comes off as a book selling tactic; her otherwise gentle voice becomes brassy.  In the future, if Dolnick let her gentle voice lead the way rather than allowing it to be overpowered by the pursuit of personal abundance, her books would be even stronger.	2004-03-03

I  requested the book as a present, so I was still obligated to read it, regardless of the negative reviews.  I admit, the first 115 pages or so are rough, as described they are filled with a manic, egocentric rant by the vampire Lestat.  Once the rant has time to play itself out a wonderful, curious and intriquing story is revealed--that of the Taltos.  Those of us who are Rice fans will already be familiar with the Taltos, yet this story reveals more details concerning the character of these unique beings.  I give the book five stars because if you survive the hackneyed beginning at the hands of Lestat, a whole new world is revealed.  Rice is not all washed up or rung out from mourning, she still has a trick or two up her sleeve.  If you enjoy having your vision of the world and its wide variety of beings revealed in vivid detail, give &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; a chance.  With patience you will find that the rambling of Lestat is there to create a counterpoint to the languid world of the Taltos.  Moreover, those who shy away from goth, will find that the Taltos offer a sci-fi element that is refreshing.  Rice is a gifted writer, mistress of detail who is so brazen that she even combines several different genres (horror, science fiction, the fantastic and romance)successfully, between the covers of a single book.  You go girl!	2004-01-22

I found that I gained a wider appreciation for traditions that I had never even thought of as having anything in common with my own.  This almanac expanded personal horizons, for the better. I appreciate a book that makes obvious, though not forced, efforts to be inclusive and well-rounded.

This is one of the most indepth, cross-cultural guides to amulets and talisman that I've come across and that includes over 25 years of research in this field.  I have subtracted 1 star because at times the author is a little too much of an erudite for the general reader who may become bogged down with jargon.  Nevertheless the dense text, great illustrations and multicultural analysis make this book wwelcome on the shelf of anyone studying magic, mysticism or esoteric symbolism.  As a paperback it is reasonably priced which is an additional benefit.	2003-07-12

Every dieter can be sure of one thing, each diet book that comes out promises to be THE book, that changes your life for ever. Well, all of those books are gathering dust on my lengthy diet book shelf--THE book that changed my life, forever is &quot;Neanderthin.&quot;<br />The premise is simple, eat like your ancestors, get trim and strong and never go hungry.  By ancestors, I'm speaking way back, about our Paleolithic forebears.  In case you're foggy on this topic, these were the hunter-gatherer people.  The diet is somewhat akin to Dr. Atkins' but you don't go into ketosis.  &quot;Neanderthin&quot; touts natural whole food, preferably organic.  Nuts and seeds; berries and other fruits; veggies, olive &amp; flaxseed oil, plenty of water and a ton of meat round out the offerings.  The author encourages folks to reach out of the ordinary supermarket meats, to try ostrich, buffalo, venison and a variety of eggs.<br />Like one of the other reviewers I lost a lot, quickly--12 pounds in the first week.  Naturally, the weight has slowed yet it continues each week.  I have no intentions of ever going back to a carb-based diet.  I've curbed the sugar demons and wheat bloat that I use to suffer from.  This diet is a sweet ticket to freedom for all of the sugar and carb addicts out there!<br />I took off 1 star because I've been able to work the diet, which is based on a low glycemic index, to include safe grains and a tiny bit of diary without slowing my weight-loss or increasing cravings.  Most people will also probably end up trying to add a smidgen of each but will not suffer ill effects.	2003-07-06

While the miraculously synchronized events that unfold in the book are unlikely to happen to all of us, the author uses events leading to death as tools to teach us how to recognize the language of both fate and coincidence.  Kovacs deals with some of the most difficult topics humans ever encounter, with aplomb and resolve.<br />Dr. Kovacs' interpretations and analysis sometimes are weighed down by New Age jargon that masks underlying emotion, rendering the text difficult to penetrate.  The author is most engaging when she falls back on her background in literature and writing, that is, when she delves into personal narrative.  Kovacs personal accounts propel the reader to turn each page eagerly and as we move through the difficulties with her, respect for her courageous attitude mounts.  Losing a child is something dreadful and unexpected but the author turns this and other equally horrific tragedies in her life into moments of inspiration, clarity, vision and even joy.<br />There is a unique blend of western and nonwestern thought in this book.  Dr. Kovacs often reflects on the work of Carl Jung yet she also utilizes the Native American Medicine Wheel, Celtic Spirituality and Ancient Egyptian belief systems.  Dr. Kovacs creates a fused modality of symbolic analysis, earth celebration and ritual; the outcome inspires personal healing and global transformation.<br />Kovacs work demonstrates that every event however erratic, unplanned or seemingly spontaneous, stems from a divine plan.  The author shows how observations of art, dreams and intuition of all of the people in your circle can lift the shroud from the phenomena called death. Betty Kovacs message is one of hope-thankfully, she has passed the torch on to light the way for the rest of us.unplanned or seemingly spontaneous, stems from a divine plan.

Greene asserts that people are actually capable of full transformations from human to animal and back again. The author doesn't care about winning over her readers who might also be shifters, she dispenses warnings and critiques the shifter community at large. Whether you believe the author can do full transformations or not, her writing is that of real lone wolf. She doesn't seem to have her community behind her, she is sketchy in her case studies, she wants to have no contact with her readers. Rosalyn Greene has thrown out into the wind, some very powerful ideas and tools and then left us as readers to do with them what we will. I applaud her approach that demonstrates elder wisdom and restraint.<br />My major criticisms of the book are that the title suggests that the book will be a broad overview of shifting but the contents are almost completely devoted to werewolves. She would help readers truly interested in the topic if she discussed the various types of shifters in-depth. It would also have been helpful if she could have stepped outside of the White European and North American experience more often, to speak more in depth about weres in Asia (she suggests many types of shifters are of Asian descent)Indigenous Americans and African society as well. Still, I recommend the book and advise readers to keep in mind that &quot;The Magic of Shapeshifting&quot; is an introduction with a memoirist rather than a researcher's approach.	2003-06-29

European fairies and Vodou--am I missing something?<br />The biggest warning and red flag is within the title itself, &quot;voodoo&quot; is a misnomer constructed by commercial interests like Hollywood--the proper name is Vodou or Vodoun.

The first chapter Something Wicked This Way Comes: The Wicked Witch takes it name aptly from a line in a spell from Shakespeare's Macbeth. I was pleased to find this piece as the opening work in \\"Witches' Brew\\" but disappointed that this beautiful piece is abbreviated.<br />Something Wicked This Way Comes also contains W.B. Yeats, \\"The Sorcerer.\\"  Jocks identifies Yeats as a Ceremonial Magician in addition to the revered Irish poet and playwright that most know him to be.  Yeats was a member of the Theosophical Society, Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. H.P. Blavatsky cofounder of this order, is included with a piece titled \\"Can the Double Murder\\"  Cotton Mather, a staunch supporter of the 1692 Salem Witch Trials work provides an account that will chill the bones of most witches.  Mather's short piece \\"Bridget Bishop\\" concerns a witch trial that depends on \\"spectral\\" evidence.  On the lighter side, Benjamin Franklin's (yes, that Benjamin Franklin)short story is a tongue in cheek critique of the \\"scientific\\" approach used in witch trials.  Franklin's contribution written in 1730 is a short essay called \\"A Witch Trial at Mount Holly.\\"  Oscar Wilde's mother, Lady Wilde's piece \\"The Horned Woman\\" is a legend about Irish witches.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, of Sherlock Holmes fame, is included with a dark look at magic in \\"The Leather Funnel.\\"<br />Next, we find That's Witch with a \\"W\\": Witchcraft as Em-Power-ment.  This chapter presents the powerful, omnipotent, witch and crone archetype.  Beginning with a short poem by Emily Bronte, that uses nature as a metaphor for the spell that love casts.  \\"Snatcher\\" by Dean Koontz is a compelling piece that makes a delightful read aloud piece on a dark and stormy night.  This is a classic crone revenge story that includes a repulsive villain and a hideous monster.  Doreen Valiente, one of the founders of the neopaganism movement is appropriately included in the anthology twice.  Her poem \\"The Witch's Ballad,\\" provides an insiders experience of a Sabbat.  Erica Jong's \\"Figure of the Witch\\" truly embodies the theme of this chapter.<br />Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme: The Nature Witch is the last and my favorite chapter.

When I looked at the photographs of her family I felt like I could have been looking through my own family albums.  The only difficulty I had with the book is that<br />some of the recipes failed or where hit or miss, particularly baked goods, which may indicate poor directions or inaccurate measurements. With greater consideration for accuracy this book could be truelly outstanding, but as it stands it brilliantly encapsulates a particular regional cuisine, with text illuminated by fascinating photographs, while containing recipes that work well only occassionally.	2001-11-24

As a professional soapmaker I own just about every soapmaking book published.  &quot;The Handmade Soap Book&quot; by Melinda Coss is my favorite and I highly recommend it.  The photographs by Emma Peios are sensual and entice you to want to make each and every soap in the book.  The recipes are for small batches which works well while you are just learning and when you've found your favorites you can double or triple the recipes.  The recipes are well written and pretty much fail-proof.  Coss is not a soap snob or purist, rather she uses color freely to produce delightful results. Coss features both vegetable soap and animal-based materials for those who would like to experiment and choose for themselves rather than have the decision made for them which is done in many soapmaking books.  Yes, the book is a bit pricey but it is hardcover so it is durable, the photographs are inspirational and the recipes make &quot;The Handmade Soap Book&quot; worth every penny.	2001-11-24

I find &quot;The Natural Soap Book&quot; to be a great disappointment.  The recipes produce huge batches, so you'd better be an expert because after buying the expensive ingredients needed, if you are just learning or mess up you've got a very pricey addition to add to your trash.  I didn't appreciate the preachy tone of this book either.  I know it is important to broaden the horizons of the reader but Cavitches style was off-putting rather than transforming.  The useful parts of the book are the explanations of ingredients sans the opinions and 1 or 2 recipes.  Best to check this out of the library unless you enjoy burning your money.	2001-11-24

Hutchens is a helpful reference book for those desiring a greater understanding of cross-cultural applications of herbs.  The title is somewhat misleading because though there is an emphasis on Native American herbalism there is also a great deal of information regarding Russian herbology and folklore.	2001-11-24

The tender manner with which the information is presented is welcoming, encouraging, inclusive and heartwarming--bound to lead many an apprentice down the path of pursuing greater understanding of Native American medicine.	2001-11-24

It is enriching, valuable and timely that &quot;Infusions of Healing: A Treasury of Mexican American Herbal Medicine&quot; has been introduced to the public.  As an herbalist I welcome the opportunity to broaden my understanding of the traditional uses, botanical names and history of herbs by Mexican Americans, Mexicans and indigenous Americans, among others.  Davidow's book is comprehensive, thoughtful and engaging.  The style of the illustrations make them the perfect companions to the text.  I put &quot;Infusion of Healing&quot; at the top of the list of essential modern herbals for it's outstanding contribution to cross-cultural knowledge of herbal practices.	2001-11-24
