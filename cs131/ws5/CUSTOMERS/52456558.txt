Jefferson sits on death row after being involved in a robbery.  It is irrelevant whether or not he is guilty since the story is about how he and his loved ones handle his last days.  Even the most ardent supporter of capital punishment will think twice as Jefferson reacts to his godmother, his family and most importantly Grant, who becomes his spiritual advisor.  Grant not only transforms Jefferson but is transformed himself as he visits Jefferson in prison.  This emotional narrative is not a literary masterpiece but is well written, well structured and to the point.  Well worth reading at only 250 pages.  I love fiction like this.  I don't know anyone who can read this book and not be changed.  That is how strong it is.  Fiction at its best.	2004-01-24

Use all the superlatives here.  Not that the photography is spectacular which it is, not that the subjects are perfectly framed which they are and not that the colors are strikingly vibrant which as you will see is true.  But even if all these things were not true this book transports me to hundreds of places I want to go.  They are pictures of places I dream of all over the world.  And let me tell you a story.  My dad is in the hospital with little chance of recovery [82 and has had a good life] I know he has always wanted to travel but because of life circumstances he has not.  In this book there are 365 pictures of all the places he's always wanted to go.  I held each one up to him as he lay in his hospital room and he wept with the dreams that never happened.  I love this book and have bought two more since as gifts.  Simply the best and I never buy picture books.	2003-12-24

I still run and skate and workout.  But I also eat.  Many years ago I used the Scarsdale Diet if I needed to lose a few.  Today it does nothing.  So...I started to try Atkins.  I saw the damn thing on the best seller list every week so I figured it had to have some credibility.<br />No way.  I was starving by the end of the first week.  So I tried South Beach.  Same thing.  I'll never stay with it if I'm dying to sneak ice cream by 9 pm.<br />And...being a jerk for these things I then went to Carbo Addicts.  Incredible.  Follow it and you are not hungry.  I have lost 15 pounds in less than 2 months.  I get to eat one meal a day of anything I want and I feel great.  <br />This is the one.  Forget Weight Watchers and all the others.  Just stick to this and you'll lose with no effort.  Trust me.	2003-09-12

But this book is different.  It is not the great epic that the cover notes might make you think but it holds you with some witty prose and characters that reflect everyone of us.<br />The Lambert family is a bit maladjusted with crazy Denise who can't seem to find her sexuality, Chip who goes through woman for a hobby when he isn't conquering foreign countries and Gary who is a typical married middle class psych case.<br />But what held me were the parents, Alfred and Enid who had grown old together.  Enid who had put life on hold forever and Alfred who was failing quickly, burdened with dementia.  These two struggled through the story, they battled to survive a crippled family, bad health, growing apart, misunderstandings and the misgivings of having lived your whole life with someone you love but don't understand.  <br />When one of the children says to Enid about Alfred, \\"He's never going to get better is he?\\" the futile struggle of life all came into focus.<br />The title has many meanings.  The Correction can be economic, it can be what Enid did with her life at the end, it can be what Chip did after Lithuania [read it and this will all make sense]it can be what I realize I need to do with my life after reading this book.<br />If this review seems disjointed read Franzens book and it will make sense.  Slow at some points but worth reading to the dramatic, heart wrenching, gut gnawing, painful end.	2003-09-09

Lily is a young girl from South Carolina who has an oppressive, overbearing, violent father named T. Ray.  Mom [Deborah] died in a tragic accident and Lily is raised by Rosaleen. Rosaleen commits a crime and is jailed and then hospitalized.  Lily 'breaks her out' and Lily and Rosaleen go on the lamb.  The story revolves around Lily's experiences as she thinks about her unlawful act, the death of her mother, her relationships with her new friends, racial equality, sexual maturity and southern justice.<br />So well written, so well told.  The only reason I gave this book 4 stars was my struggle through the middle section.  Author Sue Monk Kidd seemed to lose her focus after about 150 pages but got it back as the book came to climax.  Certainly worth reading, I look forward to Ms. Kidds next book.	2003-08-26

I follow rules because I find it comfortable to do so.  I stop at stop lights and do a lot of things I would rather not do as well as not doing things I would like to do because I find this an orderly and secure way to live.<br />I do recognize that there are many stupid poorly conceived laws and rules but I still comply.  I have never thought about starting a revolution because the trivial moronic little rules and regulations that we are requested to comply with are unreasonable in a free society.  But that is the topic of this book.<br />Few books in my life have changed my thinking over the long term.  Unintended Consequences did this.  This book is about the gun culture.  How it began and where it is today.  I never never never thought about how not only many of the Federal firearms regulations are but in a more global sense how many of our regulations are ridiculous.<br />This may sound like a vague description of a 800+ page book.  But this book is so global.  It talks specifically about Henry Bowman who grows up shooting guns as a hobby like many others collect stamps or ride motorcycles.  Yet he explains very slowly and methodically how his life experiences with his hobby are hampered unreasonably by Federal regulations.  You do not have to be a gun lover or hater to appreciate this book.  You only have to have a hobby or passion; any hobby or passion.  You will see how our Constitution and Bill of Rights have been beaten and changed, how we are losing our individual rights and how dangerous the repurcussions.<br />Please read this book for the message, it will change you.	2003-04-27

I seldom read these authors [except Grisham] but if everyone else is reading them I figured there had to be something there.  So I selected a Catherine Coulter novel and settled in.<br />What I found was a plot that moved along but trite dialog and unimaginative characters.  Dane is an FBI agent whose priest twin brother is murdered during a confession.  Dane teams up with a supposed street girl named Nick.  The cop dialog is simple and the technical details fairly accurate.  <br />Very predictable.  It appears that this is a formula book.  One that will be printed again with different character names, a twist in the plot and a different setting and reprinted under a different title.  It will probably sell another half a million copies.	2003-01-25

In this volume 2 brothers hatch a plot to get the big bucks.  They scheme there way to 313 million dollars but get caught in the act.  The book is the story of the brothers being hunted by their competitors.<br />No realism here and not much for the imagination.  But the plot moves along and the dialog and flow are not too bad.  This book is just short of being real good.  Perhaps Meltzer does not have a good grasp on the banking industry.  Much of the financial plotting is poorly conceived and not well described.  <br />A good summer time beach book but no Grisham.	2002-12-05

If you are a lover of language you have found a gem.  This book that reads like poetry.<br />Tha Land family survives in Minnesota with Dad and 3 children.  Mom is dead but the family unit perseveres and endears the reader from the start.  Tragedy strikes as one son commits a crime and becomes a fugutive.  Do you know how hard it is to make us like the criminal even though we know he has commited a crime?  Enger does this and more as he blends his story and a poem that is being written by one of the siblings.<br />The interwoven poem is as good as the story.  You could almost publish is separetly and sell a million copies.<br />Whatever motive you have for picking this book up your needs will be fulfilled.  If you want a masterpice of writing, a good yarn, real people or poetic justice, Peace Like a River will satisfy your desires. <br />It is hard to believe that you will find many books better than this this year.  Ten times better than most of the NY Times best sellers and I read almost every one.	2002-10-13
US	52456558	R2O3UMCVHW99DJ	0743418719	768832350	Salem Falls	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Read it for the Story	Much like Perfect Match, Picoult has written a real page turner with controversy and plausible characters.<br />This novel centers around Jack who has been convicted of a crime and is trying to start over.  Unfortunately he is accused a of a  second similar crime in his new surroundings.  The dialog is well crafted and does not cause you to read the same line three times to understand.  The prose is smooth and the story moves along at a swift pace.<br />Picoult develops her characters so you identify with them and have a vested interest in them.  The plot is a little weird including some witch practice by teenagers.  But unlike others who have reviewed this book I do not think it is far fetched.  If you have been in the high schools today you will know it happens every day.<br />Main guy Jack is the subject of a trial for the allegations.  Trial scenes are well crafted but not too in depth.  Read this book for the action.  It goes fast and is very entertaining.	2002-09-27

Nick Hornby has devised a good plot with surgeon wife Katie having an affair after a falling out with husband David.  It seems that David has recognized that he is basically a rotten S.O.B. and is going to change his life.  In doing so David changes so much from the man that Katie married that she can no longer stand him.<br />Mr. Hornby becomes too repetitive in his descriptions of Katie's dilemma.  How many ways can you read that Katie is mad and wants out.  Hornby fails to establish an emotional attachment with any of his characters.<br />Hornby is quite humerous in many of his conversations and this is partly what kept me reading.  Sentence structure and word flow is good.  Plot is average and the story becomes boring because of the repitition.<br />I think this book did reflect many of the feelings of those on the brink of divorce.  If that's you, read and get some commiseration.  If not, there are a lot of better books out there right now.  Maybe put this on the shelf and get to it later.	2002-08-27

If you have to have indisputable facts and flawless logic then perhaps non-fiction is for you.  The nay sayers of this book are hard to figure.  Picoult has offered up a story that is unique and included some pretty good characters.  This is not an epic novel to rival Twain or Hemingway but that is not what it is meant to be.<br />It is meant to be a really good story that is well told with excellent flow of words.  Our hero is a prosecutor of child sexual assault cases whose own 5 year old is sexually assaulted.  Picoult does not get too graphic but adds enough to give the feel of crime scene drama.  The plot blazes some new ground in originality.  How she handles having a son as a victim will make you say Holy cow.  Don't you get sick of the same stuff over and over?  That is not the case here.  Here is a new twist with decent characters and what I thought was a very novel close.<br />I read lots of great stuff and have no qualms about blasting the bad stuff but this is a really well written volume that keeps your interest and has good characters.  What more do you want from a book?	2002-08-16

The names and cities change but the stories all sort of blend together.  There are some authors who are more skilled at word flow than others and seem more comfortable with their style but a similarity exists that makes reading even the best volumes mundane.<br />Then you get the joyful opportunity to discover a book like Martel's Life of Pi.  This is a story like no other. There is a plot unique, thought provoking and inspiring; a main character who presents a persona so important and so basic to life and an author who writes with such ease and comfort that you think he is speaking with you in your living room over coffee.<br />Main character Piscine [Pi] is stranded in a life raft with a tiger after a ship wreck.  Don't let the seeming trviality of this brief plot review dissuade you.  Only an author with the imagination and genius of Martel could make this work.  It works so very well.  Read this book with an open mind as Martel details his suffering, his thoughts, his feelings, his emotional drain and most importantly his relationship with the tiger.  Try hard to understand what Mr. Martel is really talking about and dare to think about how you would react to the situations presented after 200 days at sea in a 26 foot raft.<br />For every 20 books I read I pray one will be like this.  It is one of the few books I have ever read that I think I could read again.	2002-06-29

Considering the hype and readers group info I expected a gem.  Not really what happened!!<br />Rebecca [main character] lost her husband and proceeded to second guess every major decision she had made in the past.  I expected dramatic changes, breathtaking life changing moves, and incidents of monumental emotional distress.<br />What really happened was a book with a somewhat shallow plot and partially developed characters.  The idea was great.  When I read the reviews I was sure that Anne Tyler would take her main character and have her experience events that we as common readers would say, &quot;Wow, if only I had thought of that&quot; but what she did was had her very plain Rebecca make minor adjustments creating very little change.<br />Disappointing but entertaining.	2002-06-09

How do you make a good book selection with so much on the market and such varying points of view?<br />John Searles may have bridged the gap of fickle book readers by writing this novel that will appeal to everyone.  It has suspense, mystery, love and action.  The words flow beautifully and the chronology is smooth.  <br />Even the name of the main character, \\"Dominick\\", is especially appealing.  Ever read a book that introduces so many characters with similar names that you need a family tree to keep them apart?  Not here.  Searles makes each character distinct and special.  <br />Dominick is a hard luck teen with a [junky] family.  His father's an alcoholic and Mom is neglected.  He tries to make them all happy but how can he when the core is rotten.  Dominick finds solace in this friends.  But when he is taken advantage of by his father's girlfriend it sends him off the deep end.<br />Read for the plot or the people, it makes no difference. Both engage you for the entire 292 pages.

So many books today portray a prize winner on the cover only to fail in entertaining or captivating the reader.  In Family Correspondence, Ms. Miller matches the cover comments and tells a convincing story with emotion.<br />The first few pages may confuse the reader.  It seems that the writer knows something the reader does not know.  But stick with it.  It is Tersa's writing style.  It all makes sense in the end so just surge forward.<br />The characters are well developed.  You relate to them whether you are male or female.  This is not a 'girly' book but a good tale of relationships that we all can identify with.<br />I am really bad with my family tree.  I need a flow chart to understand who my cousins are.  Perhaps that is the reason I was confused at times with who was who.  Don't let that stop you from buying Family Correspondence.  The important part is not how they are related but how they relate.  <br />If you have ever had a relative with cancer.  If you have ever had a relative that has had health problems that they handled stoically.  If you have ever known anyone who has struggled through illness with honor make sure you have some Kleenex handy as you read.  Much as Pat Conroy did in Beach Music, Teresa Miller has captured the devastation of family health problems in a heartfelt and appropriate manner and written them expertly for us to share.   And just to keep us interested she has added a bit of a mystery to the plot.  Great reading.	2001-12-26

But it can work.  Burnett doesn't have much credibility.  He is a holier than thou, pretentious snot.  But he has succeeded in capturing an enigma not many people have seen.  He has captured the REAL issue of the criminal justice system during his stint as a juror in a murder trial.<br />Flash by Burnett's snide remarks about his peers [remember they ARE peers] and his digs about how he even eats better than the others and listen to his discussion of law vs. justice.  It is honest, in depth and well layed out.  If you are involved in the criminal justice system in any way or are interested in some of the frustrations of those who are involved in it try reading this book.  It is worthwhile.

USA Today, New York Times Book Review, and Time all loved it.  It was a Book of the Month main selection.  But the story of Louisa Barrett fell flat and did not match the rave reviews that were quoted on the cover.<br />This 1900 drama love story takes place in Buffalo NY.  The central character Miss Barrett is headmistress of the local McCauly School for girls.  She knows everyone and is an accepted socialite.  But the story goes nowhere.  It is slow moving with few unique sections to keep the reader interested.<br />What is interesting is the historical description of one of the first water turbines to produce mass market electricity.  The hydro electric plant on the Niagra River and the use of the Falls is accurate and fascinating.  The wheeling and dealing of business people is also interesting.  Not much has changed in 100 years when it comes to sleazy business, labor strikes and behind the back deals.  They are depicted well here.<br />But the story lacks substance.  I had to struggle to get to the end.  There are so many great books out right now that I am really sorry that I spent the time to read almost 650 pages of this one.	2001-03-13

It is pretty.  It is unique.  It is a smashing success.  But everyone in CT wondered and now everyone everywhere wonders if this business is legit or not.  Jeff Benedict has certainly planted a seed of doubt in this book.<br />Although much of the book is bogged down with more details than you may want to know the basics are pretty easy to understand.

Twenty years ago this area was woods.  But can a group of self proclaimed Indians claim this area and build what has become the largest casino in the world?  Yes because they did it.

Kent Haruf has created these images for me thus making an impact not just from his wonderful narrative but because I can see his countryside, his dusty roads, his starlit nights, and his abandoned houses.  But I can also see his emotions.<br />I can see the fear in Ike and Bobbie's eyes, the lonliness in the heart of Victoria and the hope in Tom Guthrie.<br />The characters in this book are no more special than each one of us.  Tom Guthrie is a teacher whose nutso wife has left him with two sons.  Victoria is a pregnant high school girl who doesn't know who to turn to.  Maggie is a woman who hasn't found the right man but has a good heart.  Ike and Bobbie are two kids learning about life.<br />Sound familiar?  That's because the author has captured us all in this book.  He then winds us together makes us real and fills us with emotion.  The images stay with you.  The emotion disturbs you.

It is about the incredible inner struggles that these characters go through,  the unspeakable horrors of the wars in Europe and the unexplainable things that humans do to each other.  <br />Main character Saffie acts a bit strange at first.  But we understand why when we learn what she has experienced.  Same for her lover Andras.  I personally struggled with what these people had seen.  I became introsepctive and self critical as I pondered on the lives of those who lived through the Holocaust and Algerian cleansing periods.<br />Well written and fast moving, Huston has done a great job in displaying emotion and courage.  Read this book to learn a little about these characters and a lot about yourself.	2001-01-02

Unfortunately I struggled through this book waiting for the brilliance that I had heard about.  It never happened.<br />I should have read the other Amazon reviews, few of which were complimentary.  But I was intrigued by the book's flap info.  It portrayed a psychological novel with a unique twist.  &quot;Clodagh would claim that her passion for heights saved her life-but not without exacting a terrible cost...&quot;  I must have been reading a different book.  That phrase is a very innaccurate description of a mundane story.  Clodagh does experience tragedy with the death of her first love Daniel, and she does enter into some interesting relationships with a group of friends.  But the ending is mush and the story just never picks up speed.<br />But being the eternal optimist I will try another of Vines [or Rendell's] books.  Did Ruth Rendell change her pen name so we would not remember the weaker volumes she writes?  <br />Take this one out of the library if you want to try it but don't spend the money.	2000-12-30

Although the story is real and wonderful, his flow of words is like water pouring from a glass pitcher.  Smooth...<br />The story is about Dr. Hata, a Japanese man who came to America after the war.  He adopts a young Japanese girl and tries his best to bring her up as a single father.  His experience is influenced by his war assignments and his contacts with a woman near the front.  Lee moves back and forth between the two showing how much his past affects his future.<br />The descriptions in this book are detailed and sometimes gruesome.  But they are never obscene.  All further the plot and show the harsh realities of war and life.<br />So deserving of the Asian American Literary /Award this book will be the talk of the land very soon.  Dr. Hata, daughter Sunny, and real estate agen Liv are characters that I will remember for months to come.  Very real.  Oprah will be calling Mr. Lee soon.  Watch, he'll be on her list before you know it.	2000-12-12

Stick men are really deserving of a place in a French museum if you ask me.  So when my wife and kids said we are going to do some painting as a family project I laughed and figured we were changing the color of the bedroom.<br />But alas, we started to pick up ballast on the beach only to be transported home in a bag to be transformed into cute little rock pets.  Amazing, simply amazing.  Although mine looks like a toad with a tumor everyone else in the family followed the guide of this terrific book and created creatures that look like they could crawl away.<br />We have since purchased other books by this author and I am presently deciding how to re-support my house as a result of the additional 4000 pounds of rocks in the living room.  I have tried to do other rock art but have decided to watch my kids or browse through the book.  I could look at these pictures all day.  They are amazing.  Boy I admire people who can do this kind of stuff.  Get this book to create but get it to simply say WOW what an imagination some people have.	2000-12-10

Lethem has captured the life of the Tourettic and somehow enmeshed it into a fine mystery and adventure.  <br />When I first read about this book I thought I would be frustrated reading about a star with a handicap, that the hero woould be phony but brave, pitiful but admired...all that contradictory stuff that is used to glamorize a weakness.  But Lethem made this character real.  He is no martyr, just an everyday Tourettes guy going about his private detective business.<br />I actually learned a bunch about Tourettes and the inner feelings of its victims.  I learned that they are frustrated as hell but they surge through life anyway.  The story is much deeper though.  It deals with heros, frustration, love and most of all how dependent some people can get on others.<br />Hero Lionel Essrog is an orphan who has been 'adopted' by a local small time crook.  Lionel and some fellow orphans do some odd jobs for this guy and become way too attached to him.  He becomes their father figure, their, hero, their role model.  Lionel ends up showing he has more character than his role model ever had.  Other characters just add to the enjoyment. <br />I had fun reading Motherless Brooklyn.  How much you want to bet this book shows up on Oprah's list pretty soon.  Just remember I said it first.	2000-12-03

Heavy themes, hidden meanings, verbose authors.  October Sky is a get what you see book.  It is simple but not too simple.  It is an honest story about an honest guy growing up in West Virginia.  His life is like ours.  He has friends and enemies, successes and failures, girlfriends and conflicts.<br />But his life is also a model for our time.  Homer Hickam is a very special person and he has told the story of his life in this book.  Mr. Hickam grew up modestly in a coal mining town.  His love of rocketry, no his passion for rocketry pulls him out of an average community and propels him to success inspite of his family and surroundings.<br />Few books appeal to adults and young adults alike.  This is one.  I want my wife to read it as well as my 13 year old son.  Hickam is a mentor and I've never even met him.  This is such down to earth honest writing it makes you smile.<br />Read this wonderful story and you will have a hard time approaching your next mystery or drama.  It is refeshing.  I don't even want to see the movie after reading this book.  I want the images I have to last not the ones Hollywood created.	2000-11-21

Her first novel The Pleasing Hour is well written with several intertwined stories.<br />Sarah is an au pair in Paris.  King does a wonderful job of describing the uncomfortable feeling of living in a foreign land.  If you have never been there, read this, it is accurate.  As this is going on she falls in love with the father of the family and forms a unique bond with the mother.<br />Lots of emotion involved here.  It includes the children, family friends and Sarahs sister back home.<br />Kings language is straight forward and easy to follow.  Her plot is not complicated and her characters develop well.<br />There is a bit of confusion in spots when the author changes time periods and points of view.  But read on it all makes sense in the end.<br />With such a well written first novel I will be watching for King again to write something with more depth and a bit more development.  Definitely worth buying.	2000-11-06

I had never read McBain or Hunter but am always game to try a new author.<br />There are some very intersting and accurate sections to this book.  Some of the forensic descriptions are well done.  But there are also some sections that I thought were poorly written and more importantly poorly conceived.  <br />I became very confused by the large number of characters.  I lost track of which set of detectives were investigating what crime.  I lost track in the dialogue sections as to who was speaking.  And I will never understand the relevance of two city detectives going into jail and beating a prisoner and knocking his teeth out.  Does McBain mean to infer that this is how 'da city cops do da job'?<br />Rather insulting I think.<br />The story moves swiftly.  But after reading this book I am amazed that McBain has written 50 of these and that people are still buying them.  After I read Last Dance I really have little interest in reading another 87th precint story.<br />Interestingly enough the book group ALL agreed with these comments.	2000-10-27

The writing is not of the same quality.  If the marketing group had just evaluated it on its own merits this would still be a good book.<br />Not accurate in a legal sense and a bit far fetched at times, The Quiet Game is nonetheless a fun book that does capture you from the start and keeps you interested to the very end.<br />Penn Cage is a lawyer turned novelist.  Sound familiar?  He comes back to his hometown to crack a 30 year old civil rights murder case.  In an appropriately complex plot he battles local politics and national conspiracies to an exciting conclusion.<br />In the mean time there is violence and sex just enough to keep you interested but not too much to make you say , oh give me a break.  The plot moves quickly.  In fact there is not one section that slows you down and makes you consider putting the book down and start something else.<br />As I have stated in other reviews, I read to be entertained.  This book filled the bill with a plot unique enough to distinguish it from the rest of the pack but not outrageous.<br />Good for the beach but not for a literature class.  Enjoy.	2000-10-16

David Sedaris is  a wonderful writer.  He keeps your interest and the words flow so well  throughout.  Sedaris is great with dialog.  Every conversation is  realistic.  You only have to read his stuff once.  <br />Whether he is  describing music class when he is young or apartment shopping when older  Sedaris speaks with realism, wit and that ever present bit of sarcasism.   <br />I am not prone to peeking into other peoples windows but I love to walk  through the 'rich neighborhoods' and sort of NOTICE how those other people  live.  Sedaris describes his similar experience but with the humor that I  never thought of.<br />But this is a memoir not a novel so at times the book  losses a bit of focus.  It doesn't really go anywhere.  Even so it is  really fun to read and that's why I picked it up, to be entertained.  And I  was.  With that in my mind it is worth reading.  There are not many books  today that give you a good laugh and are well written too.	2000-09-12

We have read classics, kids stuff, and some current trendy stuff.  After  reading several other Don't Sweat books I picked this one up to add to my  evening reading with the kids.<br />Perfect selection.  It deals with issues  that every kid wants to talk about and presents them in a way that every  kid will listen to.<br />My 11 year old comes home often with horror stories  about what friend likes her today, what group does what to another group,  how one girl hates another girl, and how can she possibly face it all  tomorrow.<br />I counsel her, listen, feedback, and hug her.  But she needs to  know that what I am telling her is not unique.  So when we read the  chapters called &quot;Drop the Drama&quot; and &quot;Check Out these Odds!   (The Likelihood that Everyone Will Like You) she looked at me like I was a  genius.  She actually asked me if I knew the author.<br />Don't get me wrong.   This book is great for a wide age range.  I read it to my kids.  The teen  set (and beyond) will devour it.<br />Some of the issues in this book are so  universal that they need to be taught in college or business school.  The  chapter that is called &quot;Understand the Law of Focus&quot; should be  memorized by every student entering college.  This chapter reinforces the  basic of 'never obsess'.  Know anybody that is so focused on one thing that  they lose sight of everything else?  Better read this part first.<br />Well  written, to the point, and so very very relevant.  Good for early grade  schoolers to upper teens. It is by far the best Sweat book that I have  read.	2000-09-12

You  know, the guy who talks too fast, too loud and sounds like he's 'gonna make  ya swim wid da fishes' if you don't do what he says.<br />Very contradictory  with his opinions on education.  On one page he says its no good and he has  no use for it and on the next he says how important it is.<br />In summary  this is a book that spouts real estate leveraging.  Nothing more.  It is a  simple concept but not for everyone.  I get the feeling that if I don't  make millions the way this guy did I should resign as a respectable human  and eat my meals out of a dumpster.<br />Don't waste your money.  Lucky it was  30% off.

The two major players Kathy and Lester are destined for tragedy from their first  encounter.  They are dependent because of screw ups earlier in lives.   <br />But the author gives you more than you ask for.  He describes sex in  more detail than you want.  He describes kisses in more detail than you  want.  He even can make you squirm a bit just describing body functions  that are as routine as drinking water.  And at first I thought the details  were crude and unnecessary.  But I learned otherwise.<br />These details make  you understand how real these characters are.  He does the same thing with  the anti-hero Behrani and his family.  He details the odors, the customs,  the habits of these people to such an extent that you end up feeling their  emotions.<br />The story captures you with detail and empathy.  You connect  with the good and the evil.  You become engrossed with the feelings, the  minds and the souls of the characters.<br />You want to keep reading to learn  about the people as much as to see what happens.<br />Great reading.

Ms. Shreve kept me up for 2 nights to finish this book but I walked away with a sort of ho-hum feeling.  The Pilot's Wife finds out that her husband piloted a fatal  flight.  What ensues is her search for the truth.<br />Just in case Ms. Shreve  reads this, next time have Kathryn find Jack living a second life in  another place.  You could have a blast with him and his second family.   <br />The story moves along at a good pace but I was expecting those  intriguing twists and turns that make you say WOW.  There were none.  I  read it in two nights because I was so anxious that the WOW ending was just  around the corner.  <br />The writing is smooth and transition from sentence  to sentence makes us speed readers very happy.  This is the second book I  have read by Shreve.  Her When and Where was just as well written but the  plot was simple also.<br />This is great beach reading but no literary gem.  I  bet if Oprah had not endorsed it half as many people would have read it.	2000-07-01

This wonderful story centers on a twin  whose brother is psychotic.  In telling his story Dominick Birdsey [just  the name gives insight into the fascinating mind of Lamb] talks about his  childhood in a dismally dysfunctional home.  And regardless of whether you  grew up in a similar circumstance or in a more traditional environment you  will see yourself over and over again on page after page after page.<br />This  story is written with such wit and insight that we can all relate no matter  what our socio-economic standing or our race or color.  It's all there.   And although it is not a tear jerker by far I did get a little choked up at  the end.  <br />Every emotion is examined, this book validates every thing you  have ever felt, ever experienced, every mistake you have ever made.  It  makes you realize that we are all human, we all make mistakes and that  their is salvation for us all and you don't have to have an ounce of  religous spirit in you to realize it by the end of this book.<br />The Birdsey  twins represent us all.  <br />As an aside, this book takes place just a few  miles from my present home, deals with people and places that are part of  my past, relates a college experience that is almost mine, during the same  years I attended all of which added a spooky familiarity that haunted me  for all 897 pages.<br />I think this book should be mandatory reading for  every college student in the land.  It is so so good.  I learned a ton  about myself and others in the last three weeks.  I wish I could talk to  Mr. Lamb.  I have so much to ask him.<br />I'll even let you borrow my copy if  you can't get one of your own.Boy...it was great.	2000-06-05

As a result I selected While I Was Gone for my April read.  The first twenty pages captured feelings, emotions and attitudes of everyones marriage.  I thought, &quot;This is great.  This is the stuff we all experience but can't remember later&quot;.  <br />Your narrative was  insightful, crossed all gender lines and made me chuckle and shake my head  because it so accurately captured many of the tensions we all feel in long  term relationships.  <br />The story on the other hand was somewhat shallow.   I had a hard time relating to and feeling empathy for the drugged out  heroine as she tripped through the 60's.  But fortunately you recovered and  later allowed your ability to describe complex personal relationships  surface again.<br />Gee you're a good writer.  Your sentences flow toghether  nicely, your conversations are so real, and you can describe a walk on a  cold night and actually make me shiver.<br />You certainly did not write a  guide on marriage.  But you will entertain many readers with a good story.   Especially those of us who were in college in the late 60's and early  70's.<br />Power to the people, peace, and all that Haight stuff.	2000-05-04

We started with a  new gate to the pool but decided it was too easy.  What is great about this  book is that it not only gives great construction guidelines it is a  building block (no pun intended) to other projects.  <br />We finally decided  to build a bridge across Ash Brook which passes through our property about  100 yards behind the house.  At first we thought we could span 30 feet, but  later decided 15 was a better idea.  Well, the bridge in the book and our  final product did not resemble each other.  Who cares.

Yet we all have had incidents in our past that we wonder about.  If  a few details had been a little bit different would our life have been  different?  If we ran into our first love would they throw their arms  around us or say &quot;sorry I don't remember you?&quot;<br />This book  captured me.  It is easy to read, moves right along and the story line is  plausible.  Predictable perhaps but that does not detract from the book.

I was skeptical after the first 50 pages but somehow got hooked on the Croker character.  I consider myself sort of a 21rst century enlightned guy.  Not  too macho, but a male role model for my children.<br />Croker is everything I  detest about male America.  His failure to be loyal to his wife, his  elaborate expenses, his &quot;plantation&quot;, his planes, his disregard  for his employees.  I'm reading this book out of spite because I want to  see Croker 'get his'.<br />Fortunately, I have found interesting people along  the way.  This book is great fun to read.  <br />When I finish I will finish  my evaluation.  I do not expect to be disappointed.	1999-12-15

I had heard about Bagger Vance a few years ago but for some reason never picked it up. And although I am a not very often sub 100 golfer this book does not have to be about golf.  It is about every challenge you have ever had, every competition, every incident of wanting to win.  It summarizes my feelings on my swim team when I was 12 as well as my feelings watching my 12 year old todayplay hockey.  Read this book with an open mind and a free spirit.  It is fun entertaining and will remind you of something in your life	1999-11-07

Maybe it is my cynicism, maybe my life experiences, but this book grabbed me from the begining to the end.  It is irrelevant if the ending is good or bad or that the events are contrived, what is relevant is that this book  accurately reflects institutional life.  In fact if you were ever in  college, the military, law enforcement, you will relate to the  circumstances, language, and environment.  It is great.  Read it. I hoped  it would never end.  Thank you Mr. Young.	1999-08-10
