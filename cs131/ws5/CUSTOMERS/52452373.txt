I was under the impression that CS Lewis wrote this book.  I got over that pretty quick, but found this book frustrating, still.  There are snipets of CS Lewis writings, but then they abruptly end and don't really have a poper lead up.  The author decides to give you his own opinion on everything.  They have two dramatically different writing styles, so going from one to the other was very choppy and really not that enjoyable.  But, this book would be good if you just want a light overview of Lewis' arguments.	2005-10-08

This book is extraordinary.  The writing pulls you in because of the humble nature of the author.  After reading it, there is no doubt they know what they are talking about and it's not because of their credentials per say.  It's spells out everything so clearly that there is no denying the issues.  The big thing to know about this book is there are REAL specific tips and rules for communicating and dealing with situations.  It is very well organized.  And, there is more information than \\"How to talk to your kids...\\"  I wondered if I should read both - sure enough, you do need both.  I'm grateful for this book.	2005-03-25

But, she talked about getting hot pink panties like hannah... I guess it really is perfect for little girls and talks about the topic without it being \\"in your face\\" so to speak...  It definitely worked for us!	2005-03-25

After reading Sibs w/o Rivalry, this book did not seem well organized or written well.  The chapters are sort of condesending and not very deep - such as:  What to do when you bring them home from the hosptial.  Lighten up.  It's a really tough job...  If you want specific, real and practical tips on making a peaceful household with multiple children and helping your children get along with each other - turn to the other book.  This one is just not very good - sorry...	2005-03-25

I'm so surprised this book has not been rated by other folks.  This book is so good, it should be required reading.  It has REAL advice for how you should be diciplining your children in no uncertain terms.  This book is great for people who have kids from 1 to 21!!!  It has GREAT advice for parents of tweens and teenagers. I have a 1 year old and a 3 year old and I just wanted to make sure I was starting off on the right foot.  I was relieved when it didn't have a bunch of artifical advice for children under 3.  It explains how you should be interacting with your children overall.  I also liked information about anger and how to handle yourself.  This book is seriously great - read it!!!	2005-01-07

Complete opposite of Baby Wise	I feel sorry for my friends who got sucked into the whole Baby Wise theory.  This type of parenting made my life so easy.  The book is really a good book and gives parents confidence to follow their instincts.  Babies do NOT need to cry anything out.  They are not manipulating you!!  They are babies.  If you are struggling with sleep or just struggling being a  new mommy, give this book and method a try.  It has been wonderful for our family.	2003-07-19

I know it makes some of the other reviewers outraged because of the tone taken, but there are only so many ways you can sugar coat the truth.  She could have tried to just list the facts, but her points tie everything together!  She has woven a blanket of facts that have exposed the media.  Media convinces themselves that they don't have a bias.  I'm sure there are some well-meaning journalists out there.  But, the totality of the facts listed in this book makes it indisputable.  Excellent, well researched book!  ALL AMERICAN'S SHOULD READ THIS BOOK!	2002-11-06

If you are paranoid of having your little baby sleep next to you, you may not like this book either.  But, if you are wanting to be extremely close and attached to your baby.

This book saved us.  I was trying to feed on a schedule and it was NOT working.  My baby was crying all the time and was hungry! Plus, I did not understand there was a difference between nursing and breastfeeding.  This book opened my mind to the entire idea of breastfeeding and now it is by far the most enjoyable time I have with my baby.  I would never have thought that before she was born.  Get this book if you are going to breastfeed - it's MUCH HARDER THAN YOU THINK!!  And, will much more satisfactory for YOU than you think!  I just thought I would breastfeed for the baby because that's what people do now.  But, I get so much happieness from it...  This book was partly responisble for that.

I was *very* disappointed with this book.  It's like a workbook, which is a good idea.  But, the systems is not as coordinated as the Once-A-Month cooking.  It leaves it up to you to pick serving sizes.  Since you do that, you have to use the workbook to figure out what you need to buy, etc.  Plus, there are tons of black and white pictures of the people.  They went overboard showing all their friends.  It seems like a book someone in your neighborhood would put together.  Not very professional.  Plus, the recipes. I found ONE recipe in the book that sounded good.  The recipes were just cheap casserole types of dishes.  There were a couple of others, but it all looked pretty yucky.  I am going to try and resell this book back.	2001-06-23
