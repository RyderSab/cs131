This book is an excellent guide and explanation to<br />the literary/critical career of Van Wyck Brooks, who<br />\\"for more than half a century [with the publication in<br />1908 of his first book of criticism, _Wine of the<br />Puritans_, to 1962 with _Fenollosa and His Circle,<br />With Other Essays in Biography_] was a wholly dedicated<br />partisan for the cause of American literature.\\"<br /> This tribute comes from the \\"Preface\\" by the author<br />of this critical/appraising work, James Vitelli.  In<br />the Preface, Vitelli says that literature for Brooks<br />was never a mere pastime, or a business, or an<br />adornment, or \\"something to go in for,\\" but rather<br />it was life itself, life at its greatest intensity.<br />\\"Without writers committed to a vision of the beautiful,<br />the good, and the true, life simply held no promise<br />of fulfillment.\\"<br />  Brooks's views are not simplistic, though generalized<br />stereotypes of some of his insights may creep into<br />\\"post-modern\\" discussions or critiques of American<br />literature and American writers.  But, we should go<br />back to the source -- the originator -- of these<br />interesting and strongly held views of the writer,<br />the literature, and the vision for both which Brooks<br />so well put forth in his works.<br />  Brooks's published works of criticism and insight<br />include: _Wine of the Puritans_(1909); _The Soul:<br />An Essay Towards a Point of View_(1911); _The<br />Malady of the Ideal_(1913); a biography, _John<br />Addington Symonds_(1914); _The World of H.G. Wells_<br />(1915); _America's Coming of Age_ (1915); _Letters<br />and Leadership_(1918); an essay in the _Dial-,<br />\\"On Creating a Usable Past\\" (1918); _The Ordeal of<br />Mark Twain_(1920); _The Pilgrimage of Henry James_<br />(1925); _Emerson and Others_(1927); _The Life of<br />Emerson_(1932); _The Flowering of New England_(1936)<br />which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for History;<br />_New England:Indian Summer,1865-1915_(1940);<br />_The World of Washington Irving_(1944); _The Times<br />of Melville and Whitman_(1947); _The Confident Years,<br />1885-1915_(1952); _The Writer in America_(1953);<br />books of his own memories; _John Sloan: A Painter's<br />Life_(1955); _The Dream of Arcadia: American Writers<br />and Artists in Italy, 1760-1915_(1958); _Howells:<br />His Life and World_(1959); and _Fenollosa and His<br />Circle_(1962).<br />  Van Wyck Brooks was born in Plainfield, New Jersey,<br />in 1886. His early education, Vitelli says, was in<br />the Plainfield schools in the years 1897-1904 --<br />but the most significant year was the one he spent<br />in Europe, 1898-1899.  For Brooks, Europe [before<br />the War] was \\"a realm of magic...a paradise of culture<br />that had scarcely known a beginning and would never<br />know an end.\\" He spent most of his time visiting art<br />galleries and recording his enthusiasms and<br />disappointments with the works in 8 little notebooks.<br />On that trip he discovered John Ruskin's criticism,<br />and from Ruskin, Brooks acquired his ambition to become<br />a critic.<br />  Brooks, according to Vitelli, was a youth of sensitive<br />nature, capable of responding not only to the color and<br />forms of art inside the galleries but also to the<br />sensuous atmosphere of the life outside.  Italy,<br />Vitelli says, especially appealed to Brooks, and<br />thereafter always remained important, providing him<br />with a kind of standard against which he tested the<br />cultural environment of America.<br />  From Ruskin, Brooks also acquired the drive and<br />sense of importance associated with the idea of<br />a \\"purpose\\" for art...and for artists.  Brooks came<br />to feel that the artist had a special \\"calling\\" to<br />which he should be true, regardless of the external<br />trappings of the practical, business-oriented society<br />around him.  If he failed that calling to truly express<br />himself, then he had missed his opportunity to enrich<br />the culture and the lives and minds of the generation<br />in which he worked, as well as future generations to<br />come.  But Brooks also felt that the artist had a<br />treacherous path to try to tread, falling victim<br />neither to the materialistic pressures of the society<br />around him, but also not falling for the mistaken<br />ploy of becoming either \\"high-brow\\" or \\"low-brow\\"<br />in the deterministic, doctrinaire sense of those<br />designations and \\"identities.\\"  He was exasperated<br />by Twain's apparent succumbing to the \\"Puritan\\"/<br />pioneering drive to succeed in a material way --<br />but he also saw traces of that same all-too-American<br />\\"drive\\" in Whitman's later years, as Whitman curried<br />his image and fame.  The artist who puts his eyes on<br />success and prestige, all too often becomes the artist<br />who fails himself, his art, and his vision.<br /> There is much of depth, insight, importance, and<br />enduring value in these works and ideas by Brooks.<br />And he needs to be re-read and re-introduced into<br />the post-modern literary and critical curricula as<br />an enduring voice from America's past whose wisdom<br />should not be ignored or lost.<br />  This, unfortunately out-of-print book, is an<br />excellent introduction to the man, his views,<br />and his influence.  Hopefully, some modern<br />publisher will re-publish this work, as well<br />as re-publish Brooks's own works of criticism.<br />Though used book editions can be purchased through<br />Amazon, only a forthcoming new edition of _The<br />Flowering of New England_ and _America's Coming<br />of Age_ (from Amereon House, 1990) apparently are<br />the only works in print.<br />  Van Wyck Brooks, who suffered from \\"chronic<br />melancholia\\" from 1927 to 1932, died in Bridgewater,<br />Connecticut, in 1963.	2002-07-28

This is simply an excellent reference work -- but also a<BR>wonderful general reading work -- filled with the detail<BR>and chronology -- and flow of American history.  It is<BR>difficult to try to convey what the experience of using<BR>this work is like.  The \\"history\\" of the United States is<BR>presented in crisp, clear, but meaningful style and<BR>point.  Each year of the history of the United States<BR>(starting with the 1st section of the CHRONOLOGY, cited<BR>as 1010-1013, but actually beginning with the date of 986:<BR>\\"Norse navigator Bjorn Herjulfson is blown off course<BR>while searching for Eric the Red's coastal Greenland<BR>settlement, founded in 986.\\"  [There is a bit more to<BR>this citation -- the delightful irony, of course, is<BR>the subtle inference that the discovery of \\"America\\"<BR>has always been a sort of accident, or unintentional<BR>error...]is filled with the citations of events for<BR>that year arranged in chronological order.<BR>  Though there are numerous citations, by day-month-year,<BR>in the work, concerning not just what is happening in<BR>the English colonies, but also in the surrounding land<BR>adjacent to the colonies, the main thrust after 1607,<BR>is to concentrate the citations on the events within<BR>the colonies, and later states.  But still, the flow<BR>of the work is what is so amazing -- for one sees the<BR>events unfolding before one's mind on a day to day<BR>basis (instead of reading a clipped general sentence<BR>or two in a general American history book).  <BR>  This work is divided into 5 major sections -- each<BR>introduced by a noted writer.  The \\"Introduction\\" is<BR>by Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., the General Editor.<BR>Schlesinger beings his \\"Introduction\\" in a very <BR>provocative fashion: \\"'In the beginning,' wrote John<BR>Locke in the _Second Treatise on Civil Government_, 'all<BR>the world was America.' Locke intended only a metaphor<BR>for the state of nature that preceded the establishment<BR>of civil society.But his metaphor evokes much more.<br />It implies a way America was first seen in Europe -- as<BR>a new beginning, a break in the long, sad continuities<BR>of history, a fresh chance for fallen humanity.\\"<BR> From there, Schlesinger writes of the major sources of<BR>paradox which he sees in American history. The first<BR>paradox, he says, is that though Americans seem to live<BR>by experiment (William James's \\"pragmatic tinkering\\"),<BR>they also show a recurrent weakness (Schlesinger's term)<BR>for ideology. The second paradox lies in the antagonism<BR>between the American affirmation of equality and the <BR>American tolerance of inequality. The third paradox<BR>is the continuing tension between order and violence<BR>in American life. The fourth paradox lies in the question<BR>of conformity versus diversity. And the final paradox<BR>has to do with the nature of the American experiment<BR>itself -- how Americans, themselves, have seen their<BR>vision, or mission, or goal.<BR>  Schlesinger discusses each of these sources of paradox<BR>in the \\"Introduction.\\"  The 5 sections of the work are:<BR>Founding a Nation (986-1787), introduced by Gordon S.<BR>Wood -- Testing a Union (1788-1865), introduced by<BR>Marcus Cunliffe -- Forging a Nation (1866-1900), <BR>introduced by S. L. Mayer -- Expanding Resources <BR>(1901-1945), introduced by Richard C. Wade --and<BR>Emerging as a World Power (1946- ), introduced by<BR>Robert H. Ferrell.<BR>  An example of the sort of detail which is available<BR>in this marvelous reference/general reading treasure<BR>is this set of citations -- under the year 1762:<BR>3 November 1762 War:  In the secret Treaty of <br />Fontainebleau, French monarch Louis XV deeds to Spain<BR>all French territory west of the Missisppi River and<BR>the Isle of Orleans in Louisiana to compensate Spain<BR>for her losses at the hands of the British [in the<BR>French and Indian War/Seven Years War]. The French<BR>are anxious to bring an early end to the Seven Years<BR>War. (p. 97)<BR> Then on p. 174, under the year 1800, comes the citation:<BR>1 October 1800 International: In the secret Treaty of San<BR>Ildefonso, Spain cedes Louisiana to France at the command<BR>of Napoleon Bonaparte, who envisions a French colonial <BR>empire on the North American continent. [This ownership,<BR>of course, allows him to sell it to the Jefferson<BR>led government, as the Louisiana Purchase (1803), when <BR>Napoleon's dreams of empire die in Haiti at the<BR>hands of Touissant L'Ouverture.]<BR> There is also an excellent Index in the back to<BR>find people, places, and events in the CHRONOLOGY.	2002-07-24

The sadness is that, so far, Volume<BR>I is not offered here.<BR>  Never having read anything by Symonds, I took a chance<BR>based on my own love of Greek art and literature, and<BR>several allusions to this work in studies on Victorian<BR>aestheticism, and decided to order this volume.  I am<BR>glad that I did.<BR>  Symonds is a critic and a writer -- with a fine sense<BR>of sight, and a poetic/artistic gift for expressing what<BR>he sees in words.  Almost every paragraph offers the<BR>sort of lines or phrases that ring with a stirring sense<BR>of beauty and aptness.  I find myself underlining and<BR>starring wondrous phrases and sentences.<BR>  This Volume 2 starts with Chapter XIV -- which means that<BR>Volume 1 contains Chapters I-XIII.  Also from Symonds'<BR>introductory words, Volume I deals with the poet dramatists<BR>Aeschylus and Sophocles.  One has to remember that the Greek<BR>dramatists were considered primarily POETS; the dramatic<BR>form was the vehicle through which their poetry was<BR>expressed.<BR>  The chapter titles of this Volume 2 tell us what<BR>Symonds covers -- and it is both amazing and excellent,<BR>in quality of focus and quality of expression.  The <BR>chapter titles going from Chapter XIV through Chapter<BR>XXV are: Greek Tragedy and Euripides; The [Dramatic]<BR>Fragments of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides; The<BR>Fragments of the Lost Tragic Poets; Ancient and Modern<BR>Tragedy; Aristophanes; The Comic Fragments; Herondas;<BR>The Idyllists [poets who wrote idylls: Theocritus, Bion,<BR>Moschus]; The [Greek]Anthology; Hero and Leander; The<BR>Genius of Greek Art; Conclusion.  Of course, all of <BR>these chapters must be read -- but the chapter which<BR>glows with light and poetry is &quot;The Genius of Greek<BR>Art.&quot;<BR> Unfortunately, the considerate hosts for these reviews<BR>only offer the option of a maximum of 20 words which<BR>can be quoted.  The temptation with Symonds' wonderful<BR>insights expressed in poetic prose, is to quote, and<BR>quote, and quote.  But as Symonds says of the Greeks:<BR>&quot;License was reckoned barbarous....  Hellenes, born to<BR>be free men, took pride in temperance.&quot; He goes on to<BR>say that their &quot;sophrosyne&quot; or self-restraint was<BR>co-extensive as a protective virtue with their &quot;to<BR>kalon&quot; (ideal of form) -- and this was the essence of<BR>their Greek-ness, the quality beloved by Phoebus [Apollo]<BR>in whom there was no dark place or any flaw.  Interestingly,<BR>Symonds makes the case that we cannot perfectly understand<BR>the Greek mindset completely, even if we look at similar<BR>scenery (in Greece today) in similar light -- for they<BR>were looking at it with Greek eyes and Greek minds.  And<BR>they lived with a different sense of themselves and of<BR>the world -- not burdened by our cultural baggage<BR>from doctrinaire prohibitions and moralistic damnings.<BR>  One of the excellent additonal features of this volume<BR>is that the excerpts from the works which Symonds cites<BR>in Greek are then translated, either in the text itself<BR>or in footnotes. One of the most entrancing sections of<BR>&quot;The Genius of Greek Art&quot; is that in which Symonds talks<BR>of the olive tree -- Athene's gift to Hellas -- and he<BR>describes its beauty against the landscape, in the light,<BR>and against the color of the sea and sky.  Then he relates<BR>the qualities of that tree and its definition to the<BR>Greek artistic values.<BR>  As he says, the Genius of the Greeks appears before<BR>us likea young man newly come from the wrestling ground,<BR>anointed, chapleted, and very calm...<BR>  * * * * * * * * *	2002-07-16

Listen to him.<BR>Don't be no &quot;barbaros&quot; - baa, baa, baa...git them sheeps<BR>outta here!<BR>  This work is divided into 12 chapters -- half the number<BR>of chapters [24] apportioned to the Books of the epic<BR>poems of the Hellenes, _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ -- so we,<BR>as &quot;moderns&quot; might salute him for his brevity.  The <BR>chapter titles are: Introduction; The Formation of<BR>the Greek People; The Country; Homer; The Polis;<BR>Classical Greece: The Early Period; Classical Greece:<BR>The Fifth Century; The Greeks at War; The Decline of<BR>the Polis; The Greek Mind; Myth and Religion; Life<BR>and Character.<BR>  From the opening foot step out of the starter's<BR>block, Kitto sets the tone.  For he says that the<BR>Greeks emerged as &quot;a people, not very numerous, not<BR>very powerful, not very well organized, who had a<BR>totally new conception of what human life was for,<BR>and showed for the first time what the human mind<BR>was for.&quot;  Ka-boom! I'm listenin'; I don't know<BR>about you! <BR>  Kitto says that the Greeks [a name applied to them<BR>later by the conquering Romans -- and still applied to<BR>them today--are they still a &quot;conquered people?&quot;  Do<BR>we love the Roman culture more than we revere the<BR>Hellenic culture?  After all, who civilized the Romans?]<BR>quite simply and naturally felt that they were different<BR>from the peopleswho surrounded them. Kitto says that<BR>the difference which the Greeks felt was not just one<BR>of language (because the foreigners did not speak<BR>Greek), but also because the foreigners did not &quot;live&quot;<BR>as Greeks, nor &quot;think&quot; as Greeks, either.  Of course,<BR>Kitto does not address what effect a language has,<BR>psychologically and culturally, on the thinking and<BR>living of its speakers - as well as the programming<BR>of the writing pattern of the language on the thinking<BR>and analyzing patterns of its users.<BR>  Kitto says that if we asked the ancient Greek what<BR>distinguished him from the barbarian (any and all non-<BR>Greeks), he would not point out the triumphs of the<BR>Greek mind, nor the fine temples, statues, or plays...<BR>he would say, &quot;The barbarians are slaves; we Hellenes<BR>are free men.&quot; Kitto goes on to point out that this<BR>&quot;eleutheria&quot; was more than political freedom, or<BR>freedom from Fate and the gods [which the Greeks did<BR>not have] -- though they did have &quot;the dignity of<BR>being a man&quot; even in the face of these trials...<BR>it was because the Greeks &quot;developed a form of<BR>POLITY [relation between the citizen and his state]<BR>which both stimulated and satisfied man's higher<BR>instincts and capabilities.&quot;<BR>  Immensely satisfying...so sit down with a cup of<BR>wine, some goat cheese, and some grapes...and slowly<BR>savor this man and his analysis of ancient Greece.<BR> * * * * * * * * *	2002-07-14

Bowra's<BR>translation--Penguin Classics) is to read (for me)<BR>shorter, fresher, clearer poetry.  <BR>  Yet, strangely, in his &quot;Introduction&quot; Fagles finds<BR>it necessary to defend Bacchylides against the greater<BR>fame and tradition of admiration for Pindar -- but<BR>Fagles does a very good job of making his case for<BR>Bacchylides (and, of course, the poetry speaks <BR>in translation in favor of Bacchylides as well).<BR>Interestingly, Bowra has written the &quot;Foreword&quot; for<BR>Fagles' edition of Bacchylides.  Bowra says that<BR>Bacchylides is hard to translate -- but the advantage<BR>for Fagles is that Bacchylides has had few translations,<BR>since the remains of his poetry were not known to<BR>modern times until 1896.  Bowra says that since Fagles<BR>is not hampered by so many previous earlier versions<BR>of translations, he makes almost a fresh start, and<BR>with unusual courage, judgment, and creative insight<br />has produced a work which is both a faithful translation<BR>of Bacchylides as well as a work of art in its own right.<BR>That is high praise indeed, from one classical translator<BR>to another.<BR>   In his &quot;Introduction,&quot; Fagles admits early on that<BR>the usual perception of Bacchylides has been that he<BR>was considered &quot;a dull and slight, or, a sweet and <BR>sometimes charming practitioner of the kind of poetry<BR>which Pindar created with profundity and magnificence.&quot;<BR>But Fagles won't let that unfair judgment go...so<BR>Pindar is by far the greater poet, is he? --well,<BR>Bacchylides handles the genre differently, with his<BR>own distinct virtues, and he is interested in different<BR>things from Pindar.  Fagles says that Bacchylides does<BR>not consider himself to be a prophet as Pindar did.<BR>Bacchylides stands back from his work and &quot;prefers to<BR>consider himself a craftsman.&quot;  The element of<BR>narrative (as in Homer) is more important to Bacchylides<BR>than in Pindar. Fagles says, &quot;Bacchylides lacks the<BR>inwardness of Pindar...He is cooler, brighter, more<BR>objective.&quot; Fagles says that in narrative grace and<BR>crisp elegance, Bacchylides is the superior to Pindar.<BR>  This volume is divided into sections of different<BR>types of poems:  Epinician Odes [14] (to honor victorious<BR>athletes in the various games held in ancient Greece--<BR>Isthmian Odes, Olympian Odes, Pythian Odes, Nemean Odes);<BR>Dithyrambs [15-27] (concerning various mythic figures--<BR>The Sons of Antenor, Heracles, Theseus [2 poems], Io,<BR>Idas, Cassandra, Pasiphae, Chiron) -- Fragments, Fragments<BR>of Uncertain Genre, and Doubtful Pieces.<BR>  There is also a section of &quot;Notes&quot; in the back to<BR>explain some aspects of the poems.<BR>  Though Bacchyides' sentences tend to be a bit more<BR>complete, to me personally, I get the same freshness<BR>from reading Fagles' renderings of these poems in<BR>their short, clear impact after reading the rather<BR>turgid Pindar (in translation), as I get when<BR>I read Emily Dickinson after having had enough<BR>of a dose of bombastic, droning, tedious<BR>Walt Whitman in his longer, &quot;prophetic&quot;<BR>pieces.  Walt can be glorious, mystic, intimate,<BR>delicate -- but he can also be tiresome.<BR>  Try Bacchylides for a refreshing easement.<BR>_______________<BR> Men can maneuver no hold<BR> Over wealth or stubborn war<BR> Or the feuds that rock a state --<BR> But raking her clouds from land to land,<BR> Destiny -- that Pandora -- ranges.<BR>   -- Bacchylides.<BR> * * * * * * * * *	2002-07-13

In creative works resulting from study, research,<BR>insight, and explanation, one might point out two<BR>particular types:  the creative work of origination<BR>and the creative work of synthesis.  The originator<BR>creates a work that is seen as being one of the prime,<BR>essential works of theory and exposition around a<BR>particular subject.  Such a study is widely admired<BR>and often quoted, sometimes favorably, sometimes in<BR>argument against its ideas...or even jealousy of its<BR>fame.<BR>  The creative work of synthesis is built around a<BR>person's enthusiasm for a subject, their fervent<BR>desire to know it to its core.  They study it, live<BR>it, breathe it.  They want to explain it to others.<BR>So they begin to research, or they have collected<BR>research and quotes and source citations over time.<BR>Then they decide to commit their own understanding<BR>and insight about the subject using all of the<BR>materials and sources and ideas which they have<BR>shaped into a presentation of enlightenment.  This<br />is the person's bold presentation of his synthesized<BR>vision and creative interpretaion of the ideas and<BR>justifications gathered from sources.<BR>  In this excellent work by David Sansone, we have<BR>a very satisfying blend of research, source citation<BR>(footnotes), personal insights, and a very obvious<BR>outpouring of love of the subject and a desire to<BR>understand it to its very depths and in multiple<BR>aspects.<BR>  Sansone is a Professor of Classics at the University<BR>of Illinois, Urbana (back cover).  In his \\"Prelude\\"<BR>to this work, Sansone says that he inherited a course<BR>to teach which had been originated (ahh..) by William<BR>Abbott Oldfather, \\"the American classical scholar.\\"<BR>The course was on the sports of ancient Greece and<BR>Rome, and its purpose had been to \\"stem the tide of<BR>moral and physical degeneration and to inculcate the<BR>healthful lessons offered by the model of Greek<BR>athletics.\\" Sansone says that when he inherited the<BR>course he hit the books to supplement his lack of<BR>knowledge in some aspects of the subject. But he<BR>believed a more sophisticated and rigorous approach<BR>than Oldfather's was needed, for Oldfather had basically<BR>seen sport as a practice for war carried out by \\"blond,<BR>tall, muscular Nordics\\" who found war to be not only<BR>a necessity but an amusement, a form of entertainment.<BR>This approach did not satisfy Sansone, since he was<BR>not Nordic by heritage.<BR>  Sansone says that when he started teaching the course<BR>he had no idea of what sport was or why it was so avidly <BR>pursued by so many.  Over time, he says, he began to <BR>notice \\"the intimate connection between Greek athletics<BR>and sacrificial ritual\\" and it occurred to him \\"to<BR>wonder whether the athlete was not in some sense<BR>regarded [in ancient times] as a [type of] sacrificial<BR>victim.\\"<BR>  Sansone cites many sources in his footnotes, but<BR>they are not overwhelming.  The ideas and quotes he<BR>uses are clear and compelling.  What is of excellent<br />benefit is his clear, linear presentation of the<BR>accumulated treasure of his own findings of the<BR>evolution of sport from primitive times to the time<BR>of the Greeks.  <BR>  But Sansone does not merely stop there.  He also<BR>includes relevant comments and tie-ins with modern sport<BR>and events.  He has one very interesting section on<BR>the practice of a particular ball sport among the<BR>Cherokee Indians and uses that as a basis for relating<BR>it to aspects of Greek sport. His source is \\"Cherokee<br />Ball-Play\\" (1890) by James Mooney, included in S. Culin's<BR>_Games of the North American Indians_ (1907).<BR>  Sansone's other favorite source is a work by Karl<BR>Meuli, \\"the great Swiss scholar,\\" whose title is<BR>\\"Griechische Opferbrauche.\\"<BR>   Sansone's work is divided into two parts.  Part One is<BR>titled \\"The Genesis of Sport,\\" and Part Two is titled<BR>\\"The Nature of Greek Athletics.\\"<BR>  Inthe first part, Sansone goes into the characteristics<BR>of \\"ritual\\" and shows how those aspects relate to sport.<BR>Then he does the same with the characteristics associated<BR>with \\"sacrifice,\\" and also relates them. There is a very<BR>good \\"Selected Bibliography\\" which cites sources such<BR>as W. Burkert, _Structure and History in Greek Mythology<BR>and Ritual_; E.N. Gardiner, _Athletics of the Ancient<BR>World_; J-P Guepin, _The Tragic Pardox: Myth and Ritual<BR>in Greek Tragedy_; and H.A. Harris, Greek Athletes and<BR>Athletics_.  Perhaps the most provocative source is<BR>W.E. Sweet, \\"Protection of the Genitals in Greek <BR>Athletics,\\" published in _Ancient World_ (1985).<BR>  This is a highly interesting, informative, and<BR>enlightening work of synthesis.  And is much more<BR>valuable and useful than the \\"crock of self-evident<BR>nonsense\\" or the \\"eccentric curiosity that happened<BR>to contain a meticulous examination of the work of<BR>others\\" that he feared it might be labeled as being.<BR>Heck, I would have paid part of the price just for<BR>the cover photo of my favorite piece of sculpture,<BR>formerly known as \\"The Wrestlers,\\" now titled as<BR>\\"Pankratiasts in action\\" (Florence, Galleria degli<BR>Uffizi) [back cover information].<BR>  * * * * * * * * *	2002-07-13

[This review applies to _The Works of Henry Wadsworth<BR>Longfellow_ published by The Wordsworth Poetry Library.]<BR>  * * * * * * * * *<BR> Poor Henry Wadsworth Longfellow -- not only do many<BR>people get his name and the name of William Wordsworth<BR>mixed up, but he seems \\"doomed\\" in \\"modern\\" times to<BR>be labeled, filed, and forgotten as a \\"sentimental,<BR>sing-song poet.\\"  What an injustice!  This man was<BR>considered to be the premier poet of his day, and while<BR>it is true that fashions in taste change, it is not<BR>true that deeper insight, once gained, is meant to be<BR>brushed aside.  Few people ever achieve deeper insight,<BR>so we should listen sometimes to those who do.<BR>  There are many poems in this complete collection<BR>which even modern academics may not be aware of.  I was<BR>surprised to learn that a modern academic admitted that<BR>he had no idea of where the idea of \\"poetic inspiration\\"<BR>came from [ancient Greece] though he could have probably<BR>spouted quotes from Marx or Derrida line for line.  We<BR>have lost contact with the knowledge and culture, not<BR>only of America's past, but of the world's cultural past. <BR>  Too much attention has been lost on Longfellow in<BR>\\"immortalizing\\" him for the memorized poems.  More<BR>attention needs to be paid to him, especially in<BR>these modern times, for his deeper insights, his<BR>offering up of the Orphic, Pythagorean, and hermetic<BR>traditions as well. As one modern critic has said of<BR>him: \\"If Longfellow's achievements have been minimized<BR>in our century, that is partly because students of<BR>American literature have been less interested in the<BR>conservative aesthetics of restraint than in the <BR>comparatively radical-experimental aesthetics of <BR>visionary romanticism.\\" -- Lawrence Buell; \\"Introduction\\"<BR>to _Selected Poems_ (Penguin Classics).  Yet, moderns<BR>are cutting themselves off from an even loftier<BR>visionary past...one that extends back to ancient<BR>times and has richly influenced the thought and<br />writings of many of the world's more profound<BR>thinkers and poets.  Longfellow was also a translator<BR>of the work of other poets -- but we should understand<BR>that we can tell something about a poet and his<BR>thinking...and his being shaped by experience...in<BR>his selection of the poems that he wishes to take the<BR>time and effort to translate.<BR>  Thus, we should look carefully -- and listen<BR>carefully - to Longfellow when he chooses to translate<BR>\\"Coplas De Manrique\\" (from the Spanish).  It is not<BR>just everyone who would translate, or understand, <BR>something like this: \\"But O, how false and full of guile/<BR>That world, which wore so soft a smile/But to betray!/<BR>She, that had been his friend before,/Now from the<BR>fated monarch tore/Her charms away.\\"<BR>  And the explanatory note which was printed with<BR>the poem helps us to see why Longfellow chose it:<BR>\\"In the language of his historian, 'Don Jorge Manrique,<BR>in [this] elegant Ode, full of poetic beauties, rich<BR>embellishments of genius, and high moral reflections,<BR>mourned the death of his father as with a funeral hymn.<BR>This praise is not exaggerated.  The poem is a model<BR>of its kind.  Its conception is solemn and beautiful;<BR>and, in accordance with it, the style moves on, --<BR>calm, dignified, and majestic.\\" (p. 27)<BR>  The poems I would suggest need fresh attention and<BR>modern reading are: Coplas De Manrique; Endymion;<BR>The Goblet of Life; Mezzo Cammin; The Occultation of<BR>Orion; Gaspar Becerra; Suspiria; Prometheus; Enceladus;<BR>Fata Morgana; The Haunted Chamber; Charles Sumner <BR>[the thoughts expressed]; The Herons of Elmwood; Haroun<BR>Al Raschid; Palingenesis; Hawthorne (May 23, 1864);<BR>Three Friends of Mine (5 sonnets); The Descent of<BR>the Muses; Keramos; Rondel (translation from Froissart);<BR>Ovid In Exile (Tristia, Book III, Elegy X); from<BR>the Seven Sonnets from Michael Angelo (To Vittoria <BR>Colonna; Dante; Canzone); Jugurtha; Night; Hermes<BR>Trismegistus; Possibilities; Dedication (before<br />the poem Michael Angelo).<BR>  There is much of wonder, solemnity, and grandeur<BR>in Longfellow. As Albert Glover says in the<BR>Introduction to this volume: \\"...Longfellow's work<BR>remains noble in its dedication to ideals which<BR>defy mere fashion.  His voice is learned, tolerant,<BR>compassionate, and courageous.\\" (--Albert Glover,<BR>\\"Introduction.\\")<BR>  Here are a few lines from \\"Endymion\\":<BR> Like Dian's kiss, unasked, unsought,<BR> Love gives itself, but is not bought;<BR>  Nor voice, nor sound betrays<BR>  Its deep, impassioned gaze.<br /> It comes, -- the beautiful, the free,<BR> The crown of all humanity, --<BR>  In silence and alone<BR>  To seek the elected one.<BR>    --Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.<BR> * * * * * * * * *	2002-07-01

Bruce Franklin would be a good beginning<BR>place for anyone interested in Melville's knowledge of<BR>and use of mythology. That said, it should also be said<BR>that it should be used with caution. Franklin is determined<BR>to focus each of the major works within the framework<BR>of a particular mythic structure...which he believes<BR>he discerns by the various multiple allusions and images<BR>to be found in the work. Perhaps he has the correct<BR>grasp, perhaps he doesn't. But the questing thinker should<BR>at least know where Franklin is going, and the maps he<BR>plans to use to guide the traveler along the way.<BR> The title of this review suggests a good alternative<BR>text which one could have beside one, to counter-balance<BR>Franklin's more \\"civilized\\" approach to mythology -- and<BR>that is a work which alerts us to the fact that in<BR>dealing with mythology (even the glorious mythology of<BR>the Greeks) we should not forget its ancient, more<BR>primitive roots and how they survive in the later<BR>myths--that work is Jane Ellen Harrison's _Prolegomena<BR>to the Study of Greek Religion_ -1903-, modern<BR>reprinting by Princeton Univ. Press, 1991, Mythos Books.<BR> Franklin, in his \\"Acknowledgments\\" (this book was<BR>first published in 1963) says that previous scholars<BR>and their works had already dealt with certain aspects<BR>of mythology and it associations with their study of<BR>Melville's works--Henry Murray's editorship of a<BR>_Pierre_; Walter Bezanson's editorship of _Clarel_;<br />Howard Horsford's editorship of _Journal of a Visit<BR>to Europe and the Levant_, and \\"most important,<BR>Howard Vincent and Luther Mansfield's _Moby-Dick_\\"<BR>(all of these particular editions--except Horsford--<BR>had been published by Hendricks House, and are<BR>excellent not only for their \\"Introductions\\" but<BR>also for their copious \\"Explanatory Notes\\" in the back).<BR> To give the potential reader and/or buyer of this<BR>work an idea of Franklin's views, the titles of his<BR>chapters are: Melville and the Gods; Mardi--A Study<BR>of Myths and Mythmaking; Moby-Dick--An Egyptian Myth<BR>Incarnate [what about the fact that Vishnu is cited<BR>as the grand-master of all whalers in _Moby-Dick_,<BR>oops!]; Pierre--The Petrification of Myth; Worldly<BR>Safety and Other-Worldly Saviors---Bartleby, The<BR>Ascetic's Advent,--Benito Cereno, The Ascetic's<BR>Agony,--The Ascetics' Allegorical Masquerade;<BR>The Confidence-Man--The Destroyer's Eastern<BR>Masquerade; Billy Budd; or, Bili-Budd--The Last<BR>Avatar; and The Wake of the Gods.<BR> Franklin lays down an interesting purple carpet<BR>for us to enter the palace upon (as long as we<BR>keep looking all round us...and especially watch<BR>our backs, and don't climb in any cauldrons or<BR>tubs to bathe!): \\"Since all myth is by definition<BR>fictional[hmm...is it? what about the historical<BR>or ritual elements it may be covering up or<BR>transmuting?], no one should be surprised to find<BR>that literary fiction is mythic. Literary fiction<BR>does essentially the same thing as primitive mythic<BR>fiction: both tell made-up stories [you know he<BR>is going to irritate me, if he keeps this up!]about<BR>the human and natural worlds and both implicitly assign<BR>a high order of truth to those made-up stories.\\" ...<BR>[He goes on to say that the myths we have, come to<BR>us from \\"higly developed civilizations\\" (the very<BR>Romantic idealist fallacy --not Classical idealist!--<BR>that Jane Harrison so brilliantly and tellingly<BR>disputes in her _Prolegomena_).] <BR> Franklin goes on: \\"This study, rather than tracing<BR>Melville's knowledge of mythology, tries to show how<BR>Melville consciously used myths, mythology, comparative<BR>mythology, and mythological theories in his major<BR>works --Mardi, Moby-Dick, Piere, Bartleby, Benito<BR>Cereno, The Confidence-Man, and Billy Budd. My <BR>central thesis is that Melville's mythology determines<BR>and defines large parts of the structure and meaning<BR>of these works.\\" (p. ix). Franklin also examines the<BR>use of or Melville's deflection of \\"Christian myth,\\" and<BR>cites such previous examinations of this aspect as<BR>William Braswell's _Melville's Religious Thought_;<BR>Nathalia Wright's _Melville's Use of the Bible_.<BR> The final EXCELLENT feature of this work is the fact<BR>that Franklin has compiled \\"A Selected Index of<BR>Non-Judaic-Christian Gods, Myths, and Religions in<BR>Melville's Works\\" in which the gods, goddesses, spirits,<BR>or terms [\\"Polynesian religion\\", for example] are<BR>listed in alphabetical order, and the works [plus<BR>page numbers or chapter numbers] where the term is<BR>found in the work are also listed.

This is an incredibly insightful, well argued, and superbly<BR>interesting study of male desire and its effects on Victorian<BR>culture. A major part of the focus of this study concerns<BR>the interacting awarenesses, defenses, attacks, and<BR>deflections of male same-sex attraction AND desire,<BR>and the various responses to those two factors<BR>in relation to the classical Greek writings and art<BR>as they influenced the thoughts and creativity of<BR>Victorian male lives, especially in the academic<BR>centers of Cambridge and Oxford Universities.  <BR>  This study is very readable, even though the<BR>first paragraph of the \\"Introduction\\" sounds too<BR>\\"academic,\\" the rest of the Introduction explains<BR>the focus.  The author of this work, Richard Dellamora,<BR>is working with or against various ideas<BR>expressed in the writings of Michel Foucault [History of<BR>Sex: Vol. 1 An Introduction; Vol. _The Use of Pleasure_],<BR>Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick [_Between Men: English Literature and<BR>Male Homosocial Desire_], Elaine Showalter [_The Female<BR>Malady: Women, Madness, and English Culture, 1830-1980_;<BR>_A Literature of Their Own_]and other writers on sexuality<BR>and gender, dealing with the Victorian period.<BR>  But this is no \\"he says; she says...\\" study.  It is <BR>truly a remarkable and incredibly insightful and<BR>interesting, well focused and clearly presented work.<BR>It is a very important source of knowledge and study<BR>in its own right--this author has well studied and<BR>knows the people, their works, and the issues and<BR>arguments involved. He clearly and inspiringly explains<BR>the meanings of the works, their major ideas, and the<BR>counter ideas, and where each is focused<BR>in its arguments. But the work is not dry reading.<BR>  Dellamora deals with male desire as it is<BR>expressed in the works of both those male writers<BR>whose affections and interests are focused on the male<BR>exclusively, as well as with those males who have<BR>sought the expression of their life association and<br />sexuality with women,but who have nonetheless been<BR>aware of, been participants in, and been celebrators<BR>of profound male bonding desire,<BR>even if not of a sexual nature. Indeed, Dellamora's<BR>main argument is that the history of the presentation<BR>of male desire in the 19th century English cultural<BR>context transcends the limitation imposed by the idea<BR>that only \\"homosexuals\\" would be aware of, feel,<BR>or desire such male oriented caring.  That idea breaks<BR>the stereotype and opens up (liberates) the cultural<BR>strictures and impositions that sadly still dominate<BR>willingness to talk of male desire and sexuality in<BR>some academic writings, especially in the United States.<BR>Mr. Dellamora is professor of English and Cultural Studies<BR>at Trent University in Ontario [according to the back cover].<BR>  The chapter titles help to show the range and excellent<BR>areas of analysis by the author, who knows and uses the<BR>writings, letters, and sources extremely well.  The titles<BR>are: Introduction-Masculine Desire and the Question of the <BR>Subject; (1) Tennyson, the Apostles, and _In Memoriam_; (2)<BR>\\"Spousal Love\\" in the Poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins; (3)<BR>[Walter]Pater at Oxford in 1864--Old Mortality and <BR>\\"Diaphaneite\\"; (4) Poetic Perversities of A. C. Swinburne;<BR>Excursus--Hopkins, Swinburne, and the Whitmanian Signifier;<BR>(5) [Matthew]Arnold, Winckelmann, and [Walter] Pater;<BR>(6) John Ruskin and the Character of Male Genius; (7)<BR>Leonardo, Medusa, and the Wish to be Woman; (8) \\"The New<BR>Chivalry\\" and Oxford Politics (the contest to elect a new<BR>Professor of Poetry at Oxford; the influences of Walter<BR>Pater, John Addington Symonds, and Jowett); <BR>9)Theorizing Homophobia--Analysis of Myth in Pater;<BR>(10) Homosexual Scandal and Compulsory Heterosexuality<BR>in the 1890s; Afterword--The Subject of Sexual (In)difference.<BR>  The Bibliography at the back of this book is<BR>exceptional, interesting, and informative (in terms of<BR>future sources that one might wish to consult or<BR>purchase for one's own use). It is filled with both<BR>essay and book entries, but all of a highly<BR>intellectual and culturally stimulating kind. <BR>  Dellamora presents here a thorough, well studied,<BR>well analyzed, and totally enlightening work.  It is<BR>well worth the purchase by any reader interested in<BR>the subjects of male desire, cultural impact, and<BR>artistic expression.<BR>His exceptional gift in this work is to use letters<BR>and journals to show the range of feelings and<br />expressions -- the letters between Arthur Hallam<BR>to Richard Milnes and the expressions between<BR>Tennyson and Hallam are incredibly interesting<BR>(as well as being something one would not be<BR>able to easily access from other sources).  The other<BR>personages inovlved in the Apostles and<BR>their interests and expressions and doings<BR>provide great insight also in understanding<BR>more fully the context of the cultural and personal<BR>interactions that were going on at both Cambridge<BR>and Oxford in the 1800s.<BR>[Byron and Tennyson attended Cambridge; <BR>Pater, Hopkins (tutored by Pater), Symonds,<BR>Ruskin, and Wilde attended Oxford.]<BR>  Notice: Dellamora uses the words which<BR>the writers of the works and the letters use --<BR>both Latinate and common. The words have both<BR>to do with bodily parts and sexual acts, so the<BR>general reader should be aware.  But none of<BR>this is presented in a sensationalist fashion, rather<BR>as an enlightening insight into the thoughts and ideas<BR>that motivated, influenced, and found expression (or<BR>repression) in the lives of the experiencers.  This is<BR>NOT a book about sex or about sex acts -- it is about<BR>ideas and desires and their influences on personal<BR>motivations, strivings, and artistic expressions.	2002-06-29

This is an excellent collection of Tennyson's poems,<br />very representative, very inclusive.  In order to make<br />room for so many poems with full texts, the editor has<br />chosen not to include an Introduction.  This, of course,<br />for the non-Tennyson reader or person wishing to know<br />more about him presents something of an obstacle.  However,<br />a bit of rambling to one's own library, or a municipal<br />one, can solve that.<br />  There is included a Chronology of important dates and<br />events concerning Tennyson's life.  From this, a few of<br />the important facts seem to be: 1809--born at Somersby,<br />fourth son of Revd George Clayton Tennyson, Rector of<br />Somersby; 1816-1820--pupil at Louth Grammar School,<br />subsequently educated at home by his father; 1827--<br />publishes _Poems by Two Brothers_ with his brother<br />Charles, also enters Trinity College, Cambridge University;<br />1829--meets Arthur Henry Hallam, also a student at Trinity,<br />who was to become Tennyson's close friend and the fiance<br />of Tennyson's sister Emily, also wins the Chancellor's<br />Gold Medal with his prize poem \\"Timbuctoo\\", and becomes<br />a member of the \\"Apostles,\\" a Cambridge debating society;<br />1830--publication of _Poems, Chiefly Lyrical_; 1831--death<br />of Tennyson's father, he leaves Cambridge without a<br />degree; 1833 (September) death of Hallam, his close<br />friend, from a cerebral hemorrhage while on holiday in<br />Vienna; 1840--beginning of almost a decade of depression<br />and ill health for Tennyson; 1850--marries Emily<br />Sellwood, appointed Poet Laureate of England; 1852--birth<br />of first son whom he names \\"Hallam\\"; 1883--accepts offer<br />of title of Baron, taking his seat in the House of<br />Lords in March 1884; 1892--dies on 6 October.<br />  The poems in this anthology come from the major<br />publishings of Tennyson's poems.  The first two:<br />\\"Timbuctoo\\" was published in the _Cambridge Chronicle<br />and Journal_ (1829) --and \\"The Idealist\\" was not<br />published during Tennyson's lifetime [this information<br />comes from the very good notes supplied by the Editor<br />Aidan Day at the back of the volume].<br /> The poems included in this volume which the scholar or<br />general reader might wish to know are here collected<br />in one edition [full texts], along with many more<br />than these mentioned, are: The Lady of Shalott; Oenone;<br />The Palace of Art; The Hesperides; The Lotos-Eaters;<br />Morte d'Arthur; Ulysses; Locksley Hall; short poems<br />from _The Princess_; IN MEMORIAM, A.H.H. (1850);<br />MAUD (1855); Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington;<br />The Charge of the Light Brigade; Tithonous; Lucretius;<br />To E. FitzGerald; Tiresias; The Ancient Sage; Locksley<br />Hall Sixty Years After (1886); Demeter and Persephone;<br />Crossing the Bar.  These poems are presented in<br />chronological order in the text, and the very good<br />Table of Contents in the front of the book tells<br />the poetry collection and its date from which the<br />poems come.<br />  Tennyson is one of those interesting poets that take<br />a bit of time (at least for me) to get used to -- to<br />want to read, to really listen to.  Having had the<br />experience of being required to memorize some of<br />Tennyson for my early academic training in school<br />at least got me acquainted with the more accessible,<br />but somewhat less deep poems.

The book is in two major<BR>sections: pp. 3-185 contain the English translations<BR>of the French poems (each poet has a section of poems--<BR>and the poets are presented in chronological order of<BR>their birth years); and pp. 289-443 present the same<BR>poems in the same order, but in French).  <BR>  There is a very good Table of Contents which tells<BR>the titles of the poems and the name and date of<BR>the published edition from which the poem comes, or<BR>the date of the individual poem itself.  In the back<BR>of the volume there is an exceptionally good Bibliography<BR>with both General citations, as well as specific essays<BR>on the particular poets.  Each poet also has listed<BR>the best edition of his works in that Bibliography.<BR>  The poets presented in this anthology along with<BR>very good selections from their poems (and short<BR>biographies) are:  Gerard de Nerval; Charles Baudelaire;<BR>Tristan Corbiere; Paul Verlaine; Arthur Rimbaud;<BR>Stephane Mallarme; Jules Laforgue; Guillaume Apollinaire;<BR>and Paul Valery.<BR>  The English translations are by various people, some<BR>famous by name, others not so well known to the general<BR>reader.

Though titled _Homosexuals in History_, this work is<BR>not a dry, heavily footnoted, archly worded, jargon<BR>laced, academic piece.  Rather, it is immensely interesting,<BR>engrossing, enlightening, and an excellent background to<BR>serve as base for further academic or personal research<BR>on the time periods and the personalities dealt with in<BR>the book.<BR>  Rowse gives his own perspective in the \\"Preface\\": \\"This<BR>book is decidedly _not_ pornography.  It is a serious <BR>study -- or series of studies -- in history and society,<BR>literature and the arts.  Many men of genius or great<BR>eminence appear in it: kings like James I and Frederick<BR>the Great, artists of the stature of Leonardo da Vinci<BR>and Michealangelo; intellectual giants such as Erasmus<BR>and Francis Bacon; many poets, writers and composers,<BR>scholars and collectors, soldiers and statesmen, patriots,<BR>politicians.  The subject offers immense variety, men of<BR>very different psychological make-up, character, tastes,<BR>and gifts.  Many more could have been included, but my<BR>aim has been to be representative, not exhaustive.  And<BR>I hope, by the way, that these studies may throw some light <BR>on the predisposing conditions to creativeness: in the<BR>psychological rewards of ambivalence, the double response<BR>to life, the sharpening of perception, the tensions that<BR>lead to achievement.\\" <BR>  This work is not a mere recounting, but rather an intelligent,<BR>absorbing, often witty, even humorous, and most often very<br />sympathetic account of these lives and the contexts in which<BR>they found themselves living and involved.<BR>  Rowse does not deal with ancient times, for he says that<BR>his interests as an historian began with the Renaisssance,<BR>\\"the transition from the medieval to the modern consciousness.\\"<BR>There are 16 chapters, titled: Medieval Prelude; Renaissance<BR>Figures; Elizabethans and their Contemporaries; Francis<BR>Bacon and the Court of James I; Courts andCoronets;<BR>Federick the Great and Some Germans; Regency Connoisseurs;<BR>Russia and Some Russians; Eminent Victorians; French Poets<BR>and Novelists; From Ludwig II to Rohm; Edwardians and<BR>Georgians; The Great War; Cambridge Apostles; A Handful of<BR>Americaans; and Cosmopolitan.<BR>  Each of these chapters has the lives interwoven with<BR>perceptive, intelligent, engaging comments about the<BR>times, the values and hypocrisies, the acceptance --<BR>or lack of it (both by the societies -- and sometimes<BR>crushingly, by the individuals themselves... many sad<BR>examples of the effects of repression, guilt, fear,<BR>diastrous attempts to \\"normalize\\").<BR> The sections of most interest to me, and in which Rowse<BR>really shines, are his extensive knowledge of the ins-and-<BR>outs of British cultural history.  For he includes not<BR>merely the eminent persons one might have encountered, but<BR>also lesser known, but highly interesting and influential<BR>people as well.  Thus, in the excellent chapter on \\"Eminent<BR>Victorians,\\" we read: \\"In the [English] public schools the<BR>classics were the be-all and end-all, the Alpha and Omega,<BR>of education.  They portrayed the relaxed and natural<BR>attitude of the Greeks and Romans -- as of all Mediterranean<BR>peoples -- towards sex.\\" Within this context, Rowse continues<BR>to discuss the scholars, thinkers, and writers who were<BR>influenced by that education and by the writings produced<BR>within Victorian times which examined and enlightened the<BR>Victorians about that Classical era of art, philosophy,<BR>and accepted male desire and love.  In this chapter, Rowse<BR>recounts the careers of John Addington Symonds, Horatio<BR>Brown, Lord Ronald Gower, the Marquis of Lorne, Roden Noel,<BR>Edward Carpenter (a modern activist for enlightenment,<BR>humanitarianism, and acceptance -- a devotee of Whitman and<BR>Thoreau), Walter Pater (incredibly interesting and absorbing<BR>reading), and Oscar Wilde.<BR>  The other chapters which deal with the French, the Germans,<BR>the Russians, and the Cosmopolitan figures like Constantine<BR>Cavafy, the Greek poet of Alexandria in Egypt, in the early<BR>1900's, are also excellent.<BR>  Each reader may take away his own assessments and \\"readings<BR>of history\\" -- but the text seems to say, repression and<BR>trying to tough it out, or change, or normalize through<BR>marriage have only brought sadness and damage (not only to<BR>the self, its sense of its own value and identity -- but<BR>also to others).  But profligate, decadent, hedonistic<BR>pursuit of pleasure and self, using others as objects,<BR>rather than relating to them as persons, is equally<BR>horrendous.  The message seems to be about the desire<BR>for caring love, more than carnal pleasure.<BR>  * * * * * * * * *	2002-06-21

This work by Walter Pater, published in 1873, as<br />a volume of collected (previously published) essays<br />along with an essay on \\"Winckelmann\\", a Preface, and<br />a Conclusion was [and perhaps still is] an extremely<br />influential work of aesthetic criticism.  The volume<br />helped shape [influence] the perceptions, the<br />attitudes, and the approaches of many youthful readers<br />in the late 1880's and 1890's.  It is very interesting<br />to read, immensely engaging to consider and muse about,<br />but also offers cautions to the overenthusiastic,<br />easily influenced [or persuaded] disciple.<br />  This volume consists of an Introduction [by the<br />editor, Adam Philips], a Preface [by Pater], 9 chapters,<br />and a Conclusion (in this particular edition<br />by Oxford Classics there is also a chronology, a<br />Selective Bibliography, an Appendix titled \\"Diaphaneite,\\"<br />and Explanatory Notes in the back.  The chapter titles<br />(after Pater's Preface) are: Two Early French Stories;<br />Pico Della Mirandola; Sandro Botticelli; Luca Della<br />Robbia; The Poetry of Michelangelo; Leonardo da Vinci;<br />The School of Giorgione, Joachim Du Bellay; Winckelmann;<br />and Conclusion.<br />  * * * * * * * * * *<br />  What's the problem here?  Well, unfortunately, Pater<br />is not completely reliable as an objective perceiver<br />or critic.  He tends to be a bit eccentric in his<br />individualistic perceptions and interpretations of<br />the art works, but he goes ahead and defends this<br />approach in a very \\"modern\\" sounding fashion --<br />which seems to include a bit of \\"situational perceptions,\\"<br />subjective impressions of perception and response,<br />and subjective criticism. Which makes for extremely<br />engaging [sometimes irritating] reading, but leaves<br />something to be desired as far as objective and<br />judicious thoughtfulness and truthfulness.  Pater<br />seems to believe that it is acceptable to \\"bend\\"<br />or even create facts to further his own it-pleases-<br />me-to-think-that-this-is-or-should-be-so desires.<br />  We know that we are on a slippery critical slope<br />[though it will sound all too familiar to modern<br />ears and modern apologetics] when the editor Phillips<br />informs us: \\"In Pater's first published writing, his<br />essay on Coleridge of 1866, he had suggested that --<br />'Modern thought is distinguished from ancient by its<br />cultivation of the \\"relative\\" spirit in place of the<br />\\"absolute\\" ... To the modern spirit nothing is, or<br />can be rightly known, except relatively and under<br />conditions.\\" It doesn't take much time to realize<br />that such a critical position is going to lead to<br />an end-position of aesthetic, critical, and moral<br />relativism (\\"You can't tell me I'm wrong, because<br />there is no one set way of seeing, analyzing,<br />believing, or evaluating.\\"-- the spoiled, indulged child's<br />self-justification for the validity of its own<br />ego supremacy and authority against that of any<br />parental or adult restrictions. Such a position usually<br />means a lack of any meaningful in-depth self questioning<br />or objective evaluating of personal motives, and a<br />welcoming of lack of restraints in the pursuit of<br />pleasure and non-self discipline. And this, of course,<br />is the critical negative refrain that often comes<br />against the decadent followers of Pater's credo.]<br /> The second fall-out effect of Pater's evaluations<br />and pronouncements is that some of his disciples<br />[self-styled] went farther than even he was willing<br />to approve with their hedonism and purposefully<br />shocking lifestyles and \\"decadent\\" behaviors and<br />aesthetic appetites.<br />  But it came from statements like this, which Pater<br />may have meant one way, but which their subjective,<br />individualistic perceptions took another way: \\"The<br />aesthetic critic, then, regards all the objects with<br />which he has to do,all works of art, and the fairer<br />forms of nature and human life, as powers or forces<br />producing PLEASURABLE SENSATIONS [caps are mine], each<br />of a more or less peculiar or unique kind.

But the title was so provocative,<BR>and the editorial reviews so promising, I decided to<BR>order the book. I am glad that I did. Mr. Brustein has<BR>some valuable things to say, and he is not<BR>afraid to say them...no matter whose opinion<BR>or ego gets offended or miffed.<BR> The book cover says: \\"Mr. Brustein, theatre critic for<BR>_The New Republic_ and the author of a number of<BR>distinguished books on theatre and drama...is the<BR>founder and artistic director of the American Repertory<BR>Theatre at Harvard University.\\"<BR> The book is divided into 3 main sections: \\"Positions\\"<BR>(7 articles on various aspects of the theatre, drama,<BR>and cultural intrusions); \\"Performances\\" <BR>(29 reviews written for _The New Republic_); and<BR>\\"Profiles\\" (8 articles on various cultural luminaries).<BR> Mr. Brustein very forthrightly lays out his <BR>perspective in the \\"Introduction\\": \\"But if this<BR>book has a single theme, it is that culture cannot<BR>do the work of politics. ...While political thinking<BR>could certainly benefit from a little more creative<BR>imagination, it is my belief that creative activity<BR>is almost invariably diminished when it conforms<BR>to ideology. The measure of a nation in history is<BR>not the wars it wins, or the laws it passes, or even<BR>the programs it enacts, but rather what Arthur <BR>Schlesinger, Jr., has called 'its character and<BR>achievement as a civilization.' ...My absolutes,<BR>then as now, have been the independence of the<BR>dramatic artist and the integrity of dramatic<BR>art, which need to be continually guarded against<BR>any forces that might compromise or debase them.\\"<BR> In the title essay, \\"Theatre of Guilt,\\" Brustein<BR>gets the juices flowing and the blood pressures <BR>rising with  his candid, tell-it-like-it-is<BR>(not as devoted disciples of various causes<BR>might want to hearit--or believe it) observations.<BR> \\"In its American manifestations, in fact, the<BR>Theatre of Guilt has tended to be not just rhetorical<BR>but even shrill and self-righteous. ...Some years ago<BR>I described this genre as 'plays you're not allowed<BR>to hate'[perhaps because the drama is bad, not because<BR>the message is bad or wrong] of their inspirational<BR>themes and morally elevated characters: 'In the past,<BR>this used to be a political drama.... More recently,<BR>it has almost exclusively featured ethnic and sexual<br />minority groups, thus increasing the quota of moral<BR>extortion [a bit misguided here...no one forces anyone<BR>to go to a play, and the salary of the critic is not<BR>paid or subject to the intimidations of the dramatist<BR>and his or her angered friends).<BR>To fail to respond to plays about blacks or women<BR>or homosexuals, for example, is to stand accused of racism,<BR>sexism, homophobia, or getting up on the wrong side of<BR>the bed.... Meanwhile, the theatre becomes an agency<BR>for consciousness raising [though in a certain sense, <BR>Mr. Brustein, it always has been--the question is:<BR>what is the consciousness that is being raised?],<BR>with audiences being tutored and entertained for<BR>considerably less money than a modest contribution<BR>to an effective rehabilitation program.'[Perhaps it is<BR>the corrupt and corrupting society which needs to be <BR>\\"rehabilitated\\" rather than the supposed \\"misfit.\\"<BR>Not a new or alien idea in novels or drama.]<BR>  My tone is flip, not because I find the causes<BR>unsympathetic [hmm?] -- far from it -- but because I do not<BR>believe the theatre to be either a suitable or effective<BR>place for social reform and moral black mail.\\"<BR>[There is, of course, a significant difference<BR>between a play which causes the audience to think<BR>about aspects of society and life and humanity<BR>in ways that are insightful and moving, as opposed<BR>to shallow \\"cause\\" pandering or knee-jerk cheerleading.]<BR> Mr. Brustein is an equal-opportunity critic of the<BR>Right as well as of the Left, for their intrusions<BR>of control or absurdity into the theatre, the Arts,<BR>and the dramas of life. He shows this most pointedly<BR>in the two articles titled \\"The War on the Arts, I\\"<BR>and \\"The War on the Arts, II.\\" \\"Although the ongoing<BR>war on the arts contains important economic components<BR>related to the recession, its thrust has been mainly<BR>political.

To the Ancients (mostly Greeks and Romans), the main<BR>literature to be talked of was Poetry, but Poetry was<BR>not merely what we tend to think of it as being.  For<BR>the Ancients, Poetry was primarily Drama (both Tragedy<BR>and Comedy), because their dramas were written in<BR>poetry, Epic poetry, Lyric poetry (shorter song poems),<BR>Love Poetry, Choral songs, and Sacred Poetry<BR>(Odes and Hymns).<BR>  The sources of inspiration for all of this creativity,<BR>in their belief, was the god Apollo (Master of the Lyre,<BR>a type of arm-balanced harp to be plucked with the<BR>fingers of the non-holding hand)and the 9 female<BR>divinities who served under his tutelage and protection,<BR>the Muses. Most of the Muses came to be the specific<BR>inspirers of some specific type of poetry: Euterpe<BR>(Lyric poetry); Thalia (Comic drama poetry and idyll<BR>poetry about shepherds and flocks and countryfied<BR>lovers); Melpomene (Tragic poetry); Terpsichore <BR>(Choral song and dance); Erato (Love poetry);<BR>Polyhymnia (Sacred Poetry); and Calliope (Epic poetry).<BR>The major home where the Muses were believed to reside<BR>was Mt. Helicon in Greece, but occasionally they were<BR>also thought to live on Mt. Parnassos (also in ancient<BR>Greece).  The Romans especially liked to think of the<BR>Muses as residing on Mt. Parnassos.<BR>  This volume is a collection of what is considered to<BR>be the best writing about \\"literary criticism\\" -- or<BR>rather, poetic criticism from the ancient Greek and<BR>Roman world.  The pieces by these ancient authors<BR>are presented in the chronological order of when the<BR>author lived and wrote -- thus, the line of order<BR>for the pieces is Plato (with the dialogue *Ion*,<BR>and sections from the work *Republic* which deal<BR>with poetry and poets, what part the arts should<BR>play in the education of the citizen of the republic,<BR>and the possible effects of poetry on the ethics,<BR>morality, and lifestyles of the citizens of the republic);<BR>Aristotle (with his work, *Poetics*, mostly dealing<BR>with tragic-drama poetry, its purpose, its effects--<BR>and epic poetry, and a comparison of tragedy and<BR>epic); the Roman poet Horace (his verse[!!!] epistle<BR>discussing poetry-*On Poetry*), and Longinus with his<BR>treatise *On the Sublime*, which discusses works both in<BR>poetry and prose --and style: the manner in which<BR>the work is presented, its choice of poetic or prose<BR>type, its use of language, its use of artistic effects<BR>[and affects]--Longinus gives us the beginning of<BR>real, total literary criticism of a work, analyzing<BR>not only the \\"parts\\", but the effect of the whole<BR>as a work of art.<BR>  This is certainly going much farther and deeper<BR>than merely today's \\"instant\\" criticism of two<BR>thumbs up or two thumbs down...or do I like it, or<BR>don't I like it.  This is bringing to bear intelligent,<BR>insightful, self-examining criteria as well as turning<BR>the critical examination upon the art work as well.<BR>Its is a combination of philosophical examination of<BR>aesthetics (what is beautiful?  why is it beautiful?<BR>what does it have or do that makes it beautiful? how<BR>does it produce its effect of beauty upon the <BR>beholder?) -- as well as psychological examination<BR>of the beholder and what is going on inside him or her<BR>as a result of beholding, perceiving, \\"participating\\"<BR>in interaction with the work of art.  Then, we<BR>really get into some delicious waters--for we are<BR>not mere \\"observers\\", but also are hooked-in participants<BR>with the art work and its magic effects (our responses<BR>to the work are a part of the artistic creation, too!).<BR>  In conclusion, Horace says many wondrous things<BR>in his work, I will quote only this:  \\"Poets aim either<BR>to benefit [enlighten, bring about insight, understanding,<BR>compassion], or to please [delight with effects of<BR>engaging, subtle ideas, words, sounds, images]. ***<BR>The man [or woman] who has managed to blend usefulness<BR>[not practical utility, but intellectual and spiritual<BR>deepening and eye-opening understanding] with pleasure<BR>wins everyone's approbation [applause, cheers, seat<BR>thumpings, sighs of admiration...], for he delights<BR>his reader [listener]as he instructs him.\\"<BR>  -- Horace, *On Poetry.*<BR>* * * * * * * * *	2002-06-15

[from book-- \\"Uranian\\" referring to one of  the titles associated with Aphrodite, or \\"the  heavenly Aphrodite,\\" who was supposed to be  the patroness and inspirer of love between males,  as mentioned in Plato's  _Symposium_.]<br /> This volume is  an excellent \\"beginners\\" guide to knowledge of the  well known, and not so well known, gays,  bisexuals, and lesbians in history.  The members  of this group, each, has 3 or more pages devoted  to his or her life and influence on culture.  As  the author, Paul Russell, states: \\"Whether  tangible or intangible, evidence that a person's  legacy continues in the world, luminous and alive,  is what I have sought in attempting to gauge the  extent of his or her influence.  By influence,  then, I mean the ability to effect change, to  reconfigure the parameters, to leave in one's  wake<br />a set of challenged assumptions and  transformed lives. For the purposes of this  particular ranking of influence, I have asked  myself a twofold question: How has the individual  in question, specifically as a gay man or lesbian,  contributred both to history in general and to  gay/lesbian identity in particular?\\"  Thus, there  are persons included from all areas of influence:  philosophers, poets, playwrights,  scientists,  novelists, social reformers, female liberationists  and equal status advocates, generals, rulers and  emperors, painters, sculptors, composers, ballet  dancers and impresarios, film directors, actors,  actresses, and others.<br />This is not a  sensationalist work, nor is it meant as a  scholarly study.  The lives are  interesting, informative, and upbeat -- but not  glitzy or poorly written.  The person who is very  knowlegable about gay history and contributions  may find some notable omissions (several composers  are listed in one of the lives, but they do not  have sections of their own in the volume)--  others, with less knowledge will find the work a  very helpful beginner's informative guide.<br />  There are a few inclusions which some might  find questionable -- or troubling to themselves --  as well as some omissions which might cause the  same response. Some of the perhaps \\"troubling\\"  ones (but the author explains the reason for their  inclusions within the sections) are: the inclusion  of Socrates (who wrote nothing), but not Plato  (who wrote the _Dialogues_ in which Socrates gives  voice to his thoughts), St. Augustine, Emily  Dickinson, David and Jonathan (from the Bible,  though many writers through the centuries have  emphasized the phrase from Samuel II, \\"your love  to me was wonderful, passing the love of women\\" as  speaking of a special type of male bonding beyond  mere friendship), and perhaps a few others.  The  best words to sum up the value of the work come  from the author himself in the \\"Introduction\\":  \\"One of the ways by which gay men and lesbians  have survived through the centuries is by  recognizing one another in the various disguises  we have worn.  We have survived on the consolation  of knowing there were others like ourselves. We  have been given courage by the rare example of  someone like ourselves who has burned brightly in  the imagination.  We have been fed by the creative  dreams and visions of our comrades, widely  scattered and persecuted and all but  silenced<br />though they may be.  The men and women  whose names were secretly whispered, repeated,  cherished as homosexual helped create and sustain  that amorphous phenomenon we know today as  gay culture. These people have signaled who we  were, who we might one day be.  Their example has  answered the  world's calumny, has put the lies  and stereotypes to rout, has enhanced our sense of  possiblity.\\"  -- Paul Russell.berationists                  and equal status advocates, generals, rulers and                  emperors, painters, sculptors, composers, ballet                  dancers and impresarios, film directors, actors,                  actresses, and others.<BR>This is not a                  sensationalist work, nor is it meant as a                  scholarly study.

These journals present one of the few areas (for me)<BR>in which Melville is less than he might be, but the<BR>scholarly backup provided by the main editor for<BR>this volume, Howard C. Horsford, ably assisted by<BR>Lynn Horth, G. Thomas Tanselle, Harrison Hayford, <BR>and Alma A. MacDougall fills out the volume with<BR>a wealth of \\"Discussions\\" (notes to mentioned items<BR>in the texts of the journals -- these notes go from<BR>page 250 to page 542), \\"Textual Notes\\" (not very<BR>interesting except to persons interested in the<BR>picayune details of Melville's underlinings,<BR>spellings, cross-outs, etc.), -- but then, the<BR>editors supply a section titled \\"Melville's <BR>Agricultural Tour Memorandum (1850)\\", \\"Melville's<BR>Notes in Hawthorne's _Mosses_ [From An Old Manse],<BR>and \\"Melville Abroad: Further Records (1849-1860)\\".<BR>  Many of the \\"Discussions\\" items are very interesting<BR>and informative, but the excellent additions are the<BR>drawings, photos, and photo-copies which enrich<BR>the text and the references.  There is a photo<BR>of the 5 manuscript notebooks used for his journals<BR>on p. 210 of this volume; there is a photo of<BR>Melville and his youngest brother Thomas, captain of <BR>the ship _Meteor_ on p. 196; there are also maps<BR>such as the one on p. 248 of Melville's European <BR>Route 1849-1850, Melville's Mediterranean Route<BR>1856-1857 on p. 380.<BR>  The drawings in the volume are very interesting<BR>and fine.  There are personal drawings and photocopies<BR>of personal letter entries that show the \\"human\\" side<BR>of Melville and his family.  On p. 642 there is<BR>Melville's own drawing of his home and fields at<BR>\\"Arrowhead\\" (outside of Pittsfield, Mass.); there<BR>is a photo of Melville's children on p. 637 --<BR>frail, thin looking Stanwix, Malcolm looking off<BR>into the distance, and Elizabeth looking glumly<BR>at the camera.  It follows a chilling (from the<BR>apparent lack of warmth, but maybe only from the<BR>inability to expressit to his own children) letter<BR>which Melville wrote to his son Malcolm while on<BR>his Pacific voyage of 1860.  Here is an excerpt<BR>from that letter on pp. 636-637: \\"I hope that you<BR>have been obedient to your mother, and helped her <BR>all you could, & saved her trouble.  Now is the<BR>time to show what you are -- whether you are a good,<BR>honorable boy, or a good-for-nothing one.  Any boy,<BR>of your age, who disobeys his mother, or worries her,<BR>or is disrespectful to her -- such a boy is a poor<BR>shabby fellow; and if you know any such boys, you ought<BR>to cut their acquaintance.\\"  Knowing that this son<BR>Malcolm committed suicide several years later,<BR>at home, in his bedroom, gives this letter a chilling<BR>bit of resonant context.<BR>  The journals included in this volume are: \\"Journal<BR> of a Voyage from New York to London 1849,\\" \\"Journal<BR>1856-1857\\" (of his trip to Glasgow, to Liverpool -- where<BR>he had that most interesting meeting with Hawthorne<BR>and the resulting walk and talk in the sand dunes;<BR>to Constantinople, to Alexandria and Cairo, then<BR>to Jaffa, Jerusalem, the Dead Sea (from which he<BR>would later write _Clarel_), to Athens, to Sicily,<BR>to Naples, to Rome, to Florence, to Venice, Milan,<BR>Turin, Genoa, Berne, Strasbourgh, Heidelburgh,<BR>Frankfort, Cologne, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and<BR>London, and a trip to Oxford (\\"Most interesting spot<BR>I have seen in England.  Made tour of all colleges.<BR>It was here I first confessed with gratitude my<BR>mother land, & hailed her with pride. *** Soul &<BR>body equally cared for. *** I know nothing more <BR>fitted by mild & beautiful rebuke to chastise the<BR>ranting of Yankees.\\"), Stratford, Warwick, and back<BR>to Liverpool. The final Journal is the one of 1860,<BR>\\"kept on board ship \\"Meteor\\" ...From Boston to<BR>San Francisco.\\"<BR>  Some of Melville's notes are brief and cryptic,<BR>and one is at loss to know what appears to be a<BR>personal, secretive note to jog his memory at some<BR>later time.  Some of the drawings included which I<BR>found interesting were of the Hotel de Cluny,<BR>Ehrenbreitstein, a full image photo of the statue<BR>of Antinous at the Capitoline Museum (\\"G.S. Hillard<BR>described the Antinous as 'not merely beautiful' but<BR>'beauty itself' --from note on p. 465), the relief<BR>of Antinous at the Villa Albani, the Athena at the<BR>Villa ALbani.<BR>  What surprises one from the journals is an awareness<BR>of how much walking, smoking of cigars, and drinking of<BR>various kinds of alcoholic beverages Melville did on<BR>his trips.  But then there are also the interesting<BR>people he met such as the young man he dined with<BR>who gave him a flower. Melville was also a lover of<BR>opera, good food in cheap restaurants, and a grumbler<BR>about hotels with crawly critters in the bed clothes.<BR>  All in all this is interesting country to travel<BR>through, but more from what its suggests and causes<BR>the imagination to mull over rather than the fully<BR>written text about his travels.  Like many, perhaps,<BR>the experience was the thing to be treasured and<BR>remembered, rather than to be rendered into a fully<BR>articulated prose recounting as a creative work itself<BR>(such as Thoreau's journals, or Hawthone's notebooks).	2002-06-06

Nathaniel Hawthorne, as a writer and artist, has a<br />unique effect upon me as the reader.  I am a bit put off<br />by his keep-your-distance...this is my stage, my characters,<br />my plot...you may observe, learn, but not participate<br />as experiencer...approach.  Thus he is the master artist,<br />displaying his wares...and they are wondrous.  The other<br />effect of Hawthorne upon me, is that I seem to feel that<br />his works are as carefully crafted, visualized, and<br />fatefully fulfilled (using all the motifs, symbols,<br />and foreshadowing--as well as irony, psychological<br />insight, and artistic deftness of creative imagination<br />and clever nuance) as Wagner's operas. Though \\"Young<br />Goodman Brown\\" seems a bit (just a bit,) too blatant<br />with the symbols and allegory, yet there is something<br />also immensely satisfying and complete in the intricate<br />way in which all the parts fit together.  \\"The Artist of<br />the Beautiful,\\" for me, is the supreme creation in this<br />collection of stories.<br />  It is Hawthorne's insights, both about human<br />psychology and artistic awareness and limitation, that<br />amaze and please me.  Here is an excerpt from the haunting<br />tale, \\"The Birthmark,\\" in which a perfectionist husband<br />attempts to remove a small birthmark from his wife's<br />cheek so she will be completely perfect.  The husband<br />is Aylmer; his wife is Georgiana. The wife chances upon<br />the volumes which Aylmer has, and one of them is a record<br />of all of his own experiments.  \\"But to Georgiana, the<br />most engrossing volume was a large folio from her<br />husband's own hand, in which he had recorded every<br />experiment of his scientific career, its original aim,<br />the methods adopted for its development, and its final<br />success or failure....  The book, in truth, was both the<br />history and emblem of his ardent, ambitious, imaginative,<br />yet practical and laborious life.  He handled physical<br />details as if there were nothing beyond them; yet<br />spiritualized them all, and redeemed himself from<br />materialism by his strong and eager apiration towards<br />the infinite.  In his grasp the veriest clod of earth<br />assumed a soul. * * * The volume rich with achievements<br />that had won renown for its author, was yet as melancholy<br />a record as ever mortal hand had penned.  It was the sad<br />confession and continual exemplification of the<br />shortcomings of the composite man, the spirit burdened<br />with clay and working in matter, and of the despair<br />that assails the higher nature at finding itself so<br />miserably thwarted by the earthly part.  Perhaps every<br />man of genius, in whatever sphere, might recognize the<br />image of his own experience in Aylmer's journal.\\"<br />The greatness of that insight is that it not only<br />applies to Aylmer, but it also obviously is something<br />which Hawthorne as an artist of the imagination<br />had grappled with himself -- while still having to live<br />in the practical world of matter, being assaulted by<br />its harassments, sicknesses, weakenings, dangers,<br />limits...and being forced to scratch out something by the<br />way of making a living for himself and his dependents.<br />Yet he feels somehow compromised and humiliated by the<br />ironic joke of having the transcendent consciousness<br />and soul imprisoned in the body's corruptible matter.<br />  Here is Hawthorne the Artist expressing it so well<br />in \\"The Artist of the Beautiful\\":  \\"He knew that the<br />world, and Annie as the representative of the world,<br />whatever praise might be bestowed, could never say the<br />fitting word nor feel the fitting sentiment which should<br />be the perfect recompense of an artist who, symbolizing<br />a lofty moral by a material trifle, -- converting what<br />was earthly to spiritual gold, -- had won the beautiful<br />into his handiwork.  Not at this latest moment was he<br />to learn that the reward of all high performance must be<br />sought within itself, or sought in vain.\\"<br />  The insight and artistic sensitivity and psychological<br />understanding more than outshine the stand-offish<br />stage manager and manipulator of effects.ic sensitivity and psychological<BR>understanding more than outshine the stand-offish<BR>stage manager and manipulator of effects.	2002-05-26

In a<BR>world whose future may be rationalized by the abstractions<BR>of _realpolitik_, anything that takes us closer to the<BR>heart, that makes us respond seriously and sympathetically<BR>to the individual human being is to be revered.

This volume does not present itself as a comprehensive<BR>overview of all of Western (or Eastern) philosophy.

Additional volumes<BR>which might be added along with this one would be<BR>Bertrand Russell's A HISTORY OF WESTERN PHILSOPHY, Will<BR>Durant's THE STORY OF PHILOSOPHY, and a non-philosophy<BR>book, but an excellent overview and beginning guide to<BR>further more specific reading and research -- Charles<BR>Van Doren's A HISTORY OF KNOWLEGE.<BR>  How do we know?  And, how do we know -- that we know?<BR>What are the processes by which we take the stimulations<BR>from the external world -- through our eyes, ears, nose,<BR>mouth, skin -- transmit them to our brain, and then have<BR>them decoded, categorized, analyzed, correlated, and<BR>turned into thoughts, ideas, and actions?  Most of us<BR>never think about this intricate, and very profound<br />procedure, because it happens so fast -- and we have<BR>done it so often.  But we should think about it carefully<BR>and often.  We should question the motives behind our<BR>associations and categorizations of ideas.  Do we fall<BR>into \\"habits\\" (biases, prejudices) of pleasure or ego<BR>which form the usual basis for our thought formations<BR>and actions...which prevent us from seeing and understanding<BR>things objectively...and more in their fuller light? <BR>  This excellent volume examines those same ideas in<BR>light of the philosophies of a select group of deep<BR>thinkers.  But the writing in this work is clear,<BR>insightful, and very stimulating to further reading<BR>in the philosophers themselves.  The philosophers covered<BR>in this work (after an \\"Introduction\\" titled -- \\"The<BR>Indestructible Questions\\") are:  Plato; Descartes;<BR>Hume; Hegel; Marx; and Sartre.  There is a concluding<BR>section titled: The Contemporary Scene in Philosophy.<BR>Each of these major divisions is subdivided into<BR>sections on the important concepts, analyses, and<BR>understandings contributed by the major philosopher.<BR>The sub-sections under PLATO are titled: Virtue is<BR>Knowledge; Shadow and Substance; The Divided Line;<BR>The Tri-Partite Soul; The Ideal State.  The sub-sections<BR>under DESCARTES are:  Historical Transition to the<BR>Modern World; Doubting to Believe; God Exists; The<BR>Clockwork Universe; Body and Soul.  The sub-sections<BR>under HUME are:  How do you Know?; \\"A Well-Meanin'<BR>Critter\\"; Will the Sun Rise Tomorrow?: Reason--\\"Slave<BR>of the Passions\\".  The sub-sections under HEGEL are:<BR>A Revolution in Thought; The Real is the Rational;<BR>Master and Slave; The Cunning of Reason; The Owl of<BR>Minerva.  The sub-sections under MARX are: The Young<BR>Hegelian; Alienated Man; The Conflict of Classes;<BR>The World to Come.  The sub-sections under SARTRE<BR>are: My Existence is Absurd; Nausea; \\"Condemned to<BR>be Free\\"; No Exit.<BR> Many people are offended by the idea that Plato<BR>suggested the censoring of dramatists and poets who<BR>play on the passions of their audiences.  They have<BR>labeled Plato everything from a Fascist to a proto-<BR>Communist.  The author of this text does an excellent<BR>presentation of Plato's point (one which might bear<BR>modern relevance): \\"Why does Plato so degrade and<BR>devalue the artist? Plato is suspicious of all forms<BR>of communication which use images, such as painting,<BR>poetry, sculpture, drama, religious ritual.  These<BR>art forms use images to provide fantasy rather than <BR>truth, and Plato feared that the passions of the<BR>public are easily stimulated, influenced, and controlled<BR>by their persuasive imagery. (What would Plato think<BR>of our public relations industry, which is in the <BR>business of manufacturing images for its clients?)\\"<BR>  One doesn't have to agree with Plato...but one can<BR>certainly see his point through this clear and<BR>objective presentation.  It is to our benefit to<BR>examine our own biases and \\"habits\\" of thinking<BR>and analyzing -- to keep ourselves keen to seeking<BR>the truth of what is, rather than what we would like<BR>it to be.

Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon, Rupert Brooke, and<BR>Isaac Rosenberg are four English poets who enlisted<BR>in World War I, fought in the battles, wrote about<BR>their experiences, and chronicled the truth of what<BR>they saw of war and death in their poems. Of the four,<BR>Owen, Brooke, and Rosenberg were killed in action,<BR>while Sassoon survived until 1967, when he was 80.<BR>   Of these four poets of \\"the Great War,\\" perhaps<BR>Owen is the most lyrical, tragic, and filled with<BR>pathos.  In a letter to his mother, Owen wrote<BR>after having seen a group of Scottish troops (who<BR>would soon be dead) and the strange look on some<BR>of their faces: \\"It was not despair, or terror,<BR>it was more terrible than terror, for it was a<BR>blindfold look, and without expression, like a<BR>dead rabbit's.  It will never be painted, and no<BR>actor will ever seize it.  And to describe it, I<BR>think I must go back and be with them.\\"<BR>  The editor of this volume, Douglas Kerr, says of<BR>Owen: \\"This fatal vocation to witness -- for Owen<BR>did return to the war, and was killed at the age<BR>of twenty-five, a week before the fighting ended --<BR>is the basis of his reputation as the best-known<BR>of the poets of the Great War, and one of the<BR>outstanding English writers of modern times.  All of<BR>Owen's important work in poetry was written in<BR>just over a year, the last year of his life, and <BR>almost all of it is about the war. 'My subject is<BR>War, and the pity of War', he declared. 'The Poetry<BR>is in the pity'. But it was not to be simply a<BR>poetry of mourning, and still less of consolation.<BR>'All a poet can do today is warn', he went on.<BR>'That is why the true Poets must be truthful'.\\"<BR>  Owen deals with the issues bravely and dead<BR>on...no flinching or side-stepping.  He grapples<BR>with the issues of the War, his questioning of<BR>his faith, and his affectionate awareness. As<BR>Kerr also says, \\"And although Owen's declared<BR>subject was 'War and the pity of War,' we can <BR>find glimpses of his whole life here -- his <BR>reading, his homosexuality, his friendships, his <BR>love of music, his philosophical doubts, and his<BR>physical enjoyments.  These poems contain all<BR>his personal history.  *** Owen was not a pacifist,<BR>but described himself as 'a conscientious objector<BR>with a very seared conscience'.  His disgust and<BR>compassion, his anger and his courage, have done<BR>as much as any other individual to shape the ways<BR>we understand and feel about modern war.\\"<BR>  Here is the beginning of one of Owen's poems<BR>of affection titled \\"Storm\\":<BR>  His face was charged with beauty as a cloud<BR>  With glimmering lightning. When it shadowed me<BR>  I shook, and was uneasy as a tree<BR>  That draws the brilliant danger, tremulous, bowed.<BR>-------------------------	2002-05-18

I personally find, overall, that other persons writing<BR>about and analyzing Burke and his views tend to be a bit<BR>more interesting and compelling, than Burke himself in<BR>his prose.<BR>  I do not consider myself a \\"conservative\\" -- in the<BR>sense that that is a political agenda or mindset, nor<BR>a reactionary.  There is much in academics and political<BR>philosophy which tends to want to damn by labels -- and<BR>by putting ideas into boxes, filing, and forgetting...rather<BR>than listening to, or thoughtfully considering.<BR>  One can believe in classic values, and find his<BR>grounding in classical philosophy without being a<BR>rigid reactionary or even a doctrinaire conservative.<BR>So, when Burke speaks with the speech of the<BR>Ancients and espouses classical warnings and<BR>remonstrances about the necessity of restraint<BR>and careful consideration, one can agree with him.  <BR>  And, as the editor and author of the \\"Introduction\\"<BR>to the Penguin Classics edition, Conor Cruise O'Brien,<BR>points out, there is that of the prophet in Burke as<BR>well, since he published these REFLECTIONS in 1790,<BR>before the Reign of Terror in 1793, yet he correctly<BR>foresees the excesses to which the French Revolution<BR>will proceed in its unchecked course.  <BR>  One of the best quotes which I like very much from<BR>this work follows:<BR>  \\"When I see the spirit of liberty in action, I see<BR>a strong principle at work; and this, for a while,<BR>is all I can possibly know of it.  The wild GAS, the<BR>fixed air is plainly broke loose: but we ought to <BR>suspend our judgment until the first effervescence is<BR>a little subsided, till the liquor is cleared, and <BR>until we see something deeper than the agitation of <BR>a troubled and frothy surface.  I must be tolerably<BR>sure, before I venture publicly to congratulate men<BR>upon a blessing, that they have really received one.<BR>Flattery corrupts both the receiver and the giver;<BR>and adulation is not of more service to the people<BR>than to kings.  I should therefore suspend my<BR>congratulations on the new liberty of France, until<BR>I was informed how it had been combined with<BR>government; with public force; with the discipline<BR>and obedience of armies; with the collection of an <BR>effective and well-distributed revenue; with morality<BR>and religion; with the solidity of property; with <BR>peace and order: with civil and social MANNERS. All<BR>these (in their way) are good things too; and, without<BR>them, liberty is not a benefit whilst it lasts, and<BR>is not likely to continue long.\\"	2002-05-17

This volume is an excellent introduction to four<BR>works of the Gothic mindset, which hit England at<BR>the end of the 1700s and lasted on into the early<BR>Romantic period, all the way up to the late decadence<BR>of the 1890s, winding up in Robert Louis Stevenson's<BR>THE STRANGE CASE OF DR.

HYDE (1886),<BR>Oscar Wilde's THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (1891), and<BR>Bram Stoker's DRACULA (1897).<BR>  These are four of the earliest of this Gothic genre.<BR>The volume includes Horace Walpole's THE CASTLE OF<BR>OTRANTO (Christmas Eve, 1764); William Beckford's<BR>VATHEK (1786); John Polidori's VAMPYRE (1819); and<BR>a Vampire Fragment by Lord Byron (1819), \\"which was<BR>published at the end of MAZEPPA in 1819.\\"<BR>  The list of Gothic NOVELS (rather than stories)<BR>in chronological order which make the grade are:<BR>Horace Walpole's CASTLE OF OTRANTO (1764), Clara<BR>Reeve's THE CHAMPION OF VIRTUE (1777), William<BR>Beckford's VATHEK (1786), Ann Radcliffe's THE<BR>MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO (1794), Matthew Gregory Lewis's<BR>THE MONK (1795), Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN (1818),<BR>John Polidori's VAMPYRE (1819), Charles R. Maturin's<BR>MELMOTH THE WANDERER (1820).<BR>  There are excellent introductions to each of the<BR>writers and their works at the beginning of the book.<BR>In speaking of THE CASTLE OF OTRANTO, Bleiler says:<BR>\\"This novel has been called one of the half-dozen<BR>historically most important novels in English. The<BR>founder of a school of fiction, the so-called Gothic<BR>novel, it served as the direct model for an enormous<BR>quantity of novels written up through the first<BR>quarter of the 19th century....  It was probably<BR>the most important source for enthusiasm for the<BR>Middle Ages that suddenly swept Europe in the later<BR>18th century, and many of the trappings of the early<BR>19th century Romantic movement have been traced to<BR>it. It embodied the spirit of an age.\\"<BR>  There is included a series of impressive \\"Notes\\"<BR>to the novel VATHEK: An Arabian Tale.  The novel<BR>begins in an interesting fashion: \\"Vathek, ninth<BR>caliph of the race of the Abassides, was the son<BR>of Motassem, and the grandson of Haroun al Raschid.<BR>From an early accession to the throne, and the talents<BR>he possessed to adorn it, his subjects were induced to<BR>expect that his reign would be long and happy.  His<BR>figure was pleasing and majestic: but when he was<BR>angry, one of his eyes became so terrible, that no<BR>person could bear to behold it; and the wretch upon<BR>whom it was fixed instantly fell backward, and<BR>sometimes expired.  For fear, however, of depopulating<BR>his dominions and making his palace desolate, he but<BR>rarely gave way to his anger.\\"<BR>  And here is a sample bite from John Polidori's<BR>VAMPYRE: \\"There was no colour upon her cheek, not<BR>even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about<BR>her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life<BR>that once dwelt there: --upon her neck and breast<BR>was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth<BR>having opened the vein: -- to this the men pointed,<BR>crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \\"A<BR>Vampyre! a Vampyre!\\"	2002-05-09

Ah, me...one doesn't know which to be more irritated<BR>and exasperated with: whether it be Walt Whitman doing<BR>his dissembling shuck-and-shuffle about the children<BR>he had sired (to throw off a probing, serious John<BR>Addington Symonds) -- or Oscar, in this \\"j'accuse,\\" which<BR>he should have spoken while looking in a mirror, rather<BR>than writing it on paper to Lord Alfred.<BR>  This is without doubt a fascinating, horrifying,<BR>and yet in places humorous, \\"piece de Miserere mei\\"<BR>(to combine a bit of French with Latin).<BR>  If one chooses to believe Oscar, his only fault<BR>was weakness in \\"giving in\\" to Lord Alfred.  Oh,<BR>come now.  Blinded by Eros, reason flies out the<BR>door...if ever reason was in control.  There are<BR>some sentences which are devastatingly revealing,<BR>but Oscar doesn't seem to see it. \\"The trivial in<BR>thought and action is charming.  I had made it<BR>the keystone of a very brilliant philosophy expressed<BR>in plays and paradoxes.\\"  Ye gods, and little fishes!<br />And this man dared to call himself a \\"Classicist?!\\"<BR>Yikes!!!<BR>  The best exercise for the reader is to just take<BR>many of the things which Oscar accuses Lord Alfred<BR>of, and turn them toward the self-blind, self-<BR>justifying Oscar, to see their devastating hitting<BR>of the mark. Never having met the young man, but<BR>only having the \\"benefit\\" of hearsay (mostly from<BR>Oscar's literary defenders) Lord Alfred seems to have<BR>been calculating, temperamental (using anger to get<BR>his way), manipulative, etc., etc., etc. The best<BR>description of him may be Wilde's referring to him<BR>with the lines from Aeschylus' play AGAMEMNON,<BR>about the lion cub being raised in a house and<BR>being let loose to wreak havoc and ruin.<BR> But Oscar bears his share of blame -- more than just<BR>that of the \\"sin\\" of weakness which he constantly falls<BR>back upon in his own justification.  Even in the midst<BR>of what purports to be some sort of penitent cry from<BR>the depths of hell...Oscar still is ever the poseur:<BR>\\"And I remember that afternoon, as I was in the railway<BR>carriage whirling up to Paris, thinking what an impossible,<BR>terrible, utterly wrong state my life had got into, when <BR>I, a man of world-wide reputation, was actually forced<BR>to run away from England, in order to try and get rid<BR>of a friendship that was entirely destructive of everything<BR>fine in me either from the intellectual or ethical point<BR>of view....\\"  Er, when was the last time that the <BR>\\"everything fine\\" had last seen the light of day?<BR>  Was Oscar an \\"Artist,\\" as he consistently claims?<BR>Was he the wronged, harmed Artist?  Perhaps only the<BR>reader can decide that for himself.  Without doubt <BR>he was witty, acerbic, funny, cute, clever, perhaps<BR>even charming (to some -- sort of like a Pillsbury<BR>Dough Boy with flair and a clever tongue), perhaps<BR>stylish (in a frumpy, velveteen sort of way).  Was<BR>he wronged by a predatory clinger and manipulator,<BR>and a hypocritical social prudery and class power<BR>play (Oscar is no Socrates--that's for sure!)? He<BR>hardly seems worthy, in some ways, of being a poster-boy<BR>for Gay Pride parades.  More likely, he is a better<BR>warning poster boy for the self-excusing, and never<BR>take-responsibility-for-your-own-actions crowd.<BR>   But this is an incredible piece to read and think<BR>about.

One gets the impression from reading the negative reviews<br />of this novel written in these \\"modern\\" times that the<br />reviewers are refusing to recognize any correlation<br />between Gatsby and his world -- and themselves and their<br />own. It seems they would rather mask their own weakness<br />and vulnerability behind a screen of \\"objectified\\"<br />skepticism and complaints about the \\"boredom\\" of the<br />characters and the the plot. So be it. But it is at<br />their peril. For in refusing to see, the blind stumble<br />across the cliff whenever it comes.<br /> It is true, this novel on the first read (and perhaps<br />at the wrong time in one's life) may seem a surface,<br />rather than a depth. But with experience, and heartbreak,<br />shadows and depths appear not only in one's own life<br />but also in one's understanding and insight into things<br />which earlier in one's life seemed to make no sense or<br />to have no real meaning, depth, or interest. Such is<br />the wonder -- and horror -- of life and living.<br /> There are two main types of Idealists who swim in<br />the shifting, unstable oceans of life. One is the<br />Romantic Idealist -- moved by visions and fantasies<br />of beauty (usually for some unattainable female goddess,<br />who may be a Medusa in disguise), by his luring feelings<br />and passions, toward some elusive goal of ultimate bliss.<br />The other is the Classical Idealist -- moved by visions<br />and dreams of beauty (usually involving some unattainable<br />male god, who may be Hermes or a malignant Apollo in<br />disguise), by his luring Reason, divine intuitions,<br />and mystic desire for melding and absorption toward<br />communion with the Ideal (the beauty, the power,<br />the love).<br /> Jay Gatsby is a Romantic Idealist. If that fact is<br />not understood from the beginning, then all that is<br />marvelous and miraculous about his metamorphosis --<br />and \\"apotheosis\\" -- cannot fully be understood. What<br />happens to a dream deferred? What happens to a dream<br />transmogrified into a nightmare?<br /> What happens when youth, yearning, hopes and dreams<br />(weighted down from flight by the oppression and depression<br />of poor beginnings) -- suddenly meets the great<br />American fantasy of \\"the Main Chance?\\" Chapter VI of<br />this novel is the inner sanctum of the the Temple of<br />Apollo at Delphi. There we see Jay in his true light.<br />His fantasies, his future, and his fatality.<br /> \\"His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful<br /> farm people -- his imagination had never really<br /> accepted them as his parents at all. The truth<br /> was that 'Jay Gatsby' of West Egg, Long Island,<br /> sprang from his Platonic conception of himself.<br /> [Fitzgerald has it wrong -- Jay is a Romantic<br /> Idealist, not a Classical one.] He was a son of<br /> God -- a phrase which, if it means anything,<br /> means just that -- and he must be about his<br /> Father's business, the service of a vast,<br /> vulgar, and meretricious beauty. So he invented<br /> just the sort of 'Jay Gatsby' that a seventeen-<br /> year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to<br /> this conception he was faithful to the end.\\"<br /> -- F. Scott Fitzgerald. [with the addition<br /> of a few quotation marks]<br /><br /> Some lines from Catullus seem approprate to Gatsby's<br />fixation on Daisy. For poor Catullus was as hopelessly<br />driven for his Lesbia as Jay is for his Daisy:<br /> O sparrow...my Lesbia's darling pet;<br /> Her playmate, whom she loves to let<br /> Perch in her bosom and then tease...<br /> With tantalising fingertips;<br /> Provoking angry little nips<br /> For my \\"bright beauty\\" seems to get<br /> A kind of pleasure from these games...<br /> Even relief -- this being HER way,<br /> I think, of damping down the flames<br /> Of passion.

The best parts of this book, surprisingly, are Ian<BR>Kidd's  introductions -- the \\"Introduction\\" to the<BR>work itself, and the introductions which he does before<BR>each of the essays. There is no doubt that Plutarch is<BR>intelligent, literate, insightful, perhaps even wise.<BR>As a supposed adherent of Plato, however, he sometimes<BR>seems to forget his wellspring.<BR> The astonishing feature of reading Plutarch both in<BR>these essays sometimes called \\"Moralia\\" (a term which<BR>Kidd takes issue with and explains why) and<BR>his \\"Parallel Lives\\" (of Noble Greeks and Romans) is<BR>his use of psychology in furthering the insights about<BR>ethical and moral behavior.  In his \\"Lives\\" he often<BR>talks of the personalities and attitudes and emotions<BR>of the figures he is discussing (as well as the events<BR>of their lives -- such as Coriolanus' lack of a<BR>father and the temper he seemed to develop because of<BR>it) to show how those things impact upon the decisions<BR>and actions which they wind up taking.  In doing so,<BR>Plutarch makes the lives (and these essays, which<BR>contain similar psychological examples and insights)<BR>extremely interesting.<BR>  There is much that is sound and \\"right\\" in Plutarch's<BR>views -- but he seems to be leading a course away from<BR>Plato.  For Plutarch seems to be intent on the idea of<BR>reforming people IN the world, so that they might be<BR>better IN the world -- and treat others better IN the<BR>world.  Whether that is desirable -- or possible --<BR>is something best left to the individual reader to<BR>decide.  In the history of civilization, prophets,<BR>reformers, and \\"messiahs\\" have come and gone -- some<BR>have had humanizing effects on their listeners, some<BR>have had de-humanizing effects on their listeners,<BR>and some have had their words and ideas twisted to<BR>suit some new self-justification of the moment.  The<BR>world and nature go on -- men come and go -- are born<BR>and die -- \\"buy into\\" the world, its programs, its<BR>\\"values,\\" its delusions -- or do not. <BR>  Kidd's own insights about Plutarch, the history<BR>of his influence down through the ages, and about the<BR>nature of these essays is what I find valuable in this<BR>work.  Plutarch gives richness in his use of examples<BR>of incidents which happened between people (provocative<BR>people) to show the validity of what he is trying to<BR>say.  In one essay he talks of not reproving someone<BR>in front of others -- and he tells of an instance in<BR>which Plato spoke in reproof to Socrates about Socrates'<BR>berating of someone else in public -- here is Plutarch's<BR>account (from: \\"How to Distinguish a Flatterer From a<BR>Friend\\"): \\"The next point to note is that care must be<BR>taken about using candour towards a friend when there<BR>are a lot of people around -- one should bear in mind<BR>what happened to Plato. Once Socrates laid into one of<BR>his associates rather forcefully while talking near the<BR>banking stalls. Plato said, 'Wouldn't it have been<BR>better to have said that in private?'  Socrates replied,<BR>'Wouldn't it have been better for YOU to have spoken to<BR>me like that in private?'\\"<BR>  Plutarch is also surpising and richly rewarding from<BR>the examples he gives in citing the more ancient<BR>philosopher Pythagoras and incidents from his life and<BR>teaching to illustrate his admonitions.<BR>  Whether the reader \\"profits\\" from Plutarch's examples<BR>and admonitions, or not, depends upon the reader.  But<BR>there is much of interest and value here.	2002-04-14

I personally think that<BR>Remini has tightened up his prose and his observations.<BR>This one-volume edition packs a more emphatic and<BR>memorable momentum than the 3 volume edition.  The<BR>3-volume edition tends to diffuse points, as Remini<br />stretches out his explanation of a certain point.  The<BR>one-volume leaves the same point with \\"punch\\" -- and<BR>a sort of enigmatic emphasis, which causes the reader<BR>to remember the point better, I believe.<BR>  The early part of Jackson's life, his childhood and<BR>the influences on him, I find to be particularly <BR>fascinating.  There is much to think about when one<BR>reads of the hardships, the deprivations, and yet<BR>the sad reactions and compensations that Jackson made<BR>to \\"overcome\\" the depressing and ego threatening<BR>effects of those early years.  In one way, one can<BR>admire him -- in another way, sadly shake one's head<BR>as the means and the modes to cope have their way<BR>with Jackson, and in the effects he has on the lives<BR>of others.<BR>  I will leave to the reader the overall assessment<BR>of Jackson and his legacy.  But this is certainly an<BR>excellent biography to create interest and insight<BR>into an enigmatic and extremely influential figure<BR>in U.S. history -- and we see the fall-out effects<BR>of his philosophy and practices of government and<BR>\\"democracy\\" (mass opinion and mass values \\"rule\\" --<BR>De Tocqueville could see the flaws...)still around<BR>us.  <BR>  I like to look in places where most people pass by.<BR>I find interesting sorts of things.  There is this<BR>from Remini's Bibliography:<BR> \\"For the most part this book was researched from a<BR>wide variety of surviving manuscript sources, the<BR>largest single collection of which can be found in the<BR>Library of Congress.  This is the Andrew Jackson<BR>Papers, given in part to the Library by the Blair<BR>family, and it consists of roughly 22,500 items<BR>(mostly correspondence) which are kept in 269<BR>volumes and 58 containers.

The allusions<BR>are rich and subtle, and the tone is so iridescent<BR>that readers can never be quite sure of it, and find<BR>endless pleasure in disagreeing with each other about<BR>it.

[This review relates to the wondrous Penguin Classics<BR>edition of THE AENEID, \\"Tranlated into English Prose with<BR>an Introduction by W.F.Jackson Knight.\\"]<br />  If Virgil could lead the poet Dante through the wasteland<BR>and Inferno at the end of the Middle Ages, perhaps the poet<BR>Virgil, aided by the skill and inspiration of the translator<BR>W.F.Jackson Knight, might perform the same needed function for<BR>us, here at the end of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st<BR>centuries.<BR>  W.F.Jackson Knight, in his very interesting and insightful<BR>\\"Introduction,\\" makes the argument that \\"the AENEID of Virigl<BR>is a gateway between the pagan and the Christian centuries.\\"<BR>That much, itself, might serve as the basis for some excellent<BR>essays of analysis and interpretation.  But Knight has his own<BR>path to tread. So we should let him.<BR> -------------<BR>  \\"In the beginning, Rome had been a tiny settlement<BR>surrounded by enemies -- and it had needed a strong will:<BR>proud,disciplined, and sustained -- to survive at all.<BR>Rome did survive and was led on by successive hard-won<BR>victories to world dominion.<BR>  The early history is obscure, but the process seems <BR>to have taken at least five centuries of almost continuous<BR>warfare, and during that period the Romans achieved<BR>unparalleled success, apparently through unique merits<BR>of their own, combined with a special share of divine<BR>favor and good fortune [a nice touch of Pagan sentiment,<BR>there, to counter-balance the perhaps over-emphasis on<BR>the Christian tie at the beginning]. This spectacular rise<BR>of Rome was a matter for wonder and a certain reverence<BR>to the Romans themselves, especially when, in the<BR>later years of the republican period, new chances of peace <BR>and prosperity, AND A NEW ACCESS OF SKEPTICISM threatened<BR>THE OLD HABITS OF LOYALTY, INTEGRITY, and SELF-SACRIFICE\\"<BR>[capitals are mine].<BR>---------<BR>  Knight continues with his excellent \\"Introduction\\" and talks<BR>of Publius Vergilius Maro [usually denoted as \\"Virgil\\"], the<BR>excellent, visionary poet and artist who created the epic<BR>poem for Roman patriotic pride, values teaching, and national<BR>identity -- THE AENEID.<BR>  I especially like Knight's discussion of the influences on<BR>Virgil as he wrote the epic.<BR>--------<BR>  \\"The AENEID is the third, last, and longest of Virgil's<BR>poems.  It is a legendary narrative, a story about the<BR>imagined origin of the Roman nation in times long before the<BR>foundation of Rome itself.  * * * The AENEID, as any epic should<BR>be, is an exciting story extremely well told and full of<BR>incident; it can be read as a story and nothing more.  However,<BR>besides being a story, it is a kind of moving picture --<BR>carrying allusive, and in a sense, symbolic meanings. * * *<BR>In the poem [the gods and goddesses]communicate with mortal men<BR>either directly or through dreams, visions, omens, and the<BR>words of prophets and clairvoyants. Virgil had no doubt that<BR>the affairs of the earthly world are subject to the powers of <BR>another world, a world which is normally, but by no means<BR>always, invisible, but no less real for that....<BR> * * * The great poets have a way of making what is seen<BR>reveal the unseen; and they seem to do this better if they <BR>collect an enormous quantity of observations on life, their<BR>own and other people's, and then condense it under strong<BR>pressure so that even a few words have a great power of<BR>suggestion and persuasion.  No doubt they are all the time<br />choosing with precise accuracy what is most important.  The<BR>result is an allusive and partly symbolic kind of language<BR>able to communicate not merely single happenings but the<BR>universal truth behind them.<BR>  These greater poets also reach back across past time, and<BR>represent a view of the world which belongs not to one man<BR>or one generation of men but to the men of many succeeding<BR>generationsor even a whole civilization.  The experience<BR>which is distilled may be the experience of many centuries;<BR>and it may be condensed and focused by a single genius in<BR>a single poetic statement.  That is what Virgil did to the<BR>experience of the Greeks and Romans in the AENEID.\\"<BR>   [\\"Introduction.\\"  W.F. Jackson Knight. AENEID. Penguin<BR>      Classics.]<BR>-----------------<BR>  In talking of the other literary influences which helped<BR>inspire Virgil and which he distilled into his own poetic<BR>process with the helps of the fires of creative energy<BR>and intuition, Knight mentions (of course) the fact of Homer<BR>and his two major epics, the ILIAD and the ODYSSEY.<BR>  He also mentions the influence of Lucretius.  But he says:<BR>\\"Virgil knew his [Lucretius] work well and made free use<BR>of many hundreds of his phrases in the AENEID, and let them<BR>suggest ideas.  But since HE VIOLENTLY DISAGREED WITH<BR>THE MATERIALISTIC PHILOSOPHY of LUCRETIUS, he could not<BR>adopt his thought.  Indeed, he apparently delighted in turning<BR>it upside down, and expressing something far more like the<br />idealistic philosophy of PLATO, even when the phrases of<BR>Lucretius were influencing him.\\"<BR>  I very much prefer Knight's \\"prose\\" English version of the<BR>AENEID over most of the other ones which I have encountered.<BR>His English prose flows like poetry, and is eminently readable<BR>as well as instantly understood. One encounters that famous<BR>opening, translated so well into intuitive, inspired English<BR>prose:  \\"This is a tale of arms and of a man.  Fated to be<BR>an exile, he was the first to sail from the land of Troy<BR>and reach Italy, at its Lavinian shore.  He met many <BR>tribulations on his way both by land and on the ocean; high <BR>Heaven willed it, for Juno was ruthless and could not forget<BR>her anger. And he had also to endure great suffering in<BR>warfare.\\"<BR>   Inspiring and instructive, for Romans, for Dante, and<BR>for us!	2002-04-07

That title perhaps sounds like \\"hot\\" and \\"cold\\" running<BR>Seneca -- but it is rather a personal guide to how I believe<BR>one should approach Seneca and his advice in these \\"Moral<BR>Letters.\\"<BR>  My own interest in wanting to know more about him and to<BR>read about him came from two sources -- one of them was<BR>the several mentions of him by Herman Melville in his<BR>works -- and the other was the suggestion in the Oxford<BR>World's Classics edition of Petronius' SATYRICON that<BR>Trimalchio and those of his sort as depicted by Petronius<BR>might be based on the types of individuals pointed out<BR>by Seneca in his letters (p. xxix).  <BR> In the first chapter of MOBY-DICK, Ishmael (the narrator)<BR>talks about how he goes to sea -- and how he is able to<BR>bear it.  He says: \\"No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple<BR>sailor, right before the mast, plumb down into the fore-<BR>castle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.  True, they<BR>rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to<BR>spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow.  And, at first<BR>this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one's<BR>sense of honor.... The transition is a keen one, I assure<BR>you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong<BR>decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin<BR>and bear it.  But even this wears off in time.\\"<BR>  According to the Introduction in this edition by Penguin<BR>Classics (translated and with an Introduction by Robin<BR>Campbell), there were 124 letters written to Lucilius<BR>Junior, \\"a native of Pompeii, a hard-working higher civil<BR>servant (procurator in Sicily at the time) who appears to<BR>have dabbled in literature and philosophy.\\" (p. 12)<BR>  There appear to be 42 of the letters included in this<BR>edition. The negative, here, is that the letters are<BR>numbered with Roman numerals, and there is no subtitle or<BR>parenthetical information before the letters to tell what<BR>the subject matter is.  One has to \\"know\\" the letters by<BR>tradition and familiarity in order to know which number to<BR>go to in order to find Seneca's views and advice on certain<BR>topics.<BR>  The translator (Robin Campbell) gives his justification<BR>for the selection of the particular letters in his<BR>\\"Introduction.\\"  He says, \\"It may be asked what criteria<BR>have been applied in deciding which letters should be<BR>included or omitted. The first has been their interest --<BR>as they set out a philosophy and contribute to a picture <BR>of a man and of his time.  The second has been the avoidance<BR>of undue repetition of particular themes or topics of a<BR>moralist who tends towards repetitiveness.\\" (p.28)<BR>  The exasperation with Seneca comes with his dual<BR>nature -- he is both \\"social man,\\" and \\"thinking (principled)<BR>man.\\"  And occasionally he recognizes that those two things<BR>may be in conflict, and may be cause for making choices --<BR>but he also tries to be \\"practical\\" in his view of man's<BR>being also a social being, and thus having to have contact<BR>and social interaction with others of his species.  Sometimes<BR>his advice on this latter course seems temporizing, tedious,<BR>and questionable.  Here is the Seneca who is the temporizer,<BR>the go-along-to-get-along dissembler.  He quite rightly tells<BR>his reader not to merely ape the outward disdain of <BR>conventional dress and manners simply to get attention, trying<BR>to convince others of his \\"better\\" nature.  Perhaps he should<BR>have stopped here, and told his reader that reform of the<BR>self was what he should aim at -- but there seemed to be<BR>the tutor or teacher in Seneca, so he seemed prone to think<BR>he had a mission to reform others as well.  \\"The very name<BR>of philosophy, however modest the manner in which it is<BR>pursued, is unpopular enough as it is: imagine what the<BR>reaction would be if we started dissociating ourselves<BR>from the conventions of society.  Inwardly everything<BR>should be different, but our outward face should conform<BR>with the crowd [unh-hunh; strangely this does not synch<BR>with what he says later about how one's individual<BR>attitudes and values can be warped and worsened by<BR>mere association of time with the crowd and its <BR>amusements!].  * * * Let our aim be a way of life not <BR>diametrically opposed to, but better than that of the<BR>mob.  Otherwise we shall repel and alienate the very<BR>people whose reform we desire; we shall make them,<BR>moreover, reluctant to imitate us in anything for fear<BR>they may have to imitate us in everything.  The first<BR>thing philosophy promises us is the feeling of fellow-<BR>ship, of belonging to mankind and being members of a<BR>community; being different will mean the abandoning of<BR>that manifesto.\\" [Letter V, p. 37.]  It is no wonder<BR>that Melville moved away from Seneca after MOBY-DICK,<BR>especially after the crowd (the reading public and the<BR>critics) had rejected him.  There was too much of<BR>the alienated, wounded, grieving loner in Melville,<BR>anyway, to feel totally comfortable with someone like<BR>Seneca and his moral/worldly dichotomy.<BR>  The letters that appealed the most to me were the<BR>ones concerning \\"reading\\" and \\"the effect of crowds.\\"<BR>Here is some of Seneca's advice on reading:  \\"You should<BR>be extending your stay among writers whose genius is<BR>unquestionable, deriving constant nourishment from them<BR>if you wish to gain anything from your reading that will<BR>find a lasting place in your mind.  To be everywhere is<BR>to be nowhere.  People who spend their whole life travelling<BR>abroad end up having plenty of places where they can find<BR>hospitality but no real friendships.  The same must needs<BR>be the case with people who never set about acquiring<BR>an intimate acquaintanceship with any one great writer,<BR>but skip from one to another, paying flying visits to<BR>them all.\\"  [Letter II, p. 33]<BR>  And here is his observation about the effect of<BR>\\"going along with the crowd.\\"  \\"Associating with people in<BR>large numbers is actually harmful: there is not one of<BR>them that will not make some vice or other attractive<BR>to us, or leave us carrying the imprint of it or bedaubed<BR>all unawares with it.  * * * But nothing is as ruinous<BR>to the character as sitting away one's time at a show --<BR>for it is then, through the medium of entertainment, that<BR>vices creep into one with more than usual ease.  What do<BR>you take me to mean?  That I go home more selfish, more<BR>self-seeking, and more self-indulgent?  Yes, and what is<BR>more, a person crueller and less humane through having<BR>been in contanct with human beings. * * * When a mind is<BR>impressionalbe and has none too firm a hold on what is<BR>right, it must be rescued from the crowd: it is so easy<BR>for it to go over to the majority.  * * * such is the<BR>measure of the inability of any of us, even as we perfect<BR>our personality's adjustment, to withstand the onset of<BR>vices when they come with such a mighty following.\\"<BR>[Letter VII, pp. 41-42.]<BR>  Read for yourself -- decide for youself how large or<BR>small a \\"decoction of Seneca\\" is salutary for the soul --<BR>or not.	2002-04-04

The themes and the propaganda get a 3 -- of course,<BR>the style and the influence get a 5.<BR>  I suppose everyone goes through a Hemingway \\"phase\\" --<BR>fortunately not everyone gets locked into it like some<BR>sort of inescapable, fanatic, static Twilight Zone.<BR>  So what's right here?  Hemingway's novels are very<BR>accessible -- very readable -- even for the person who<BR>might hate novel reading.  There are no paragraphs of<BR>dense wording like Faulkner.  There is the lean, spare<BR>(would we insult the ancients to call it \\"Spartan\\"?)<BR>prose -- there is the seductive ambience conveyed with<BR>clever, clipped irony and innuendo.  There is a sort<BR>of fateful \\"justice\\" here in which some of the more<BR>deserving characters get their come-uppance (at least<BR>at the hands of the author playing \\"god\\" -- even if<BR>it might not happen in real life).  <BR>  What is wrong here?  Lots.  Maybe Faulkner was a <BR>boozer too -- I don't know, I never met him, never<BR>consorted with him.  But if his Nobel Prize acceptance<BR>speech is any indication of where his real values were,<BR>then he stands hands and shoulders above Hemingway in<BR>terms of themes and values.  For Hemingway only shows<BR>us forlorn, ironic, self-excusing modernist \\"brats\\"<BR>who justify messing up their own and other people's<BR>lives in the name of their supposed world-weariness,<BR>psychological angst, and post-World War I disillusionment.<BR>It would be one thing if the disillusionment and the<BR>wasteland and the frenzied lifestyle to avoid looking<BR>into the pit of their own apparent meaninglessness<BR>and the meaninglessness of existence were the actual<BR>depiction here -- but one gets the feeling that this<BR>is only a very clever cover-up.  A lifestyle and<BR>self-adulation masquerading as a \\"credo\\" -- rather<BR>than a heart-felt, true vision of nihilism and<BR>what to do in the face of it.<BR>  There is an issue here of a man and an artist<BR>afraid to face his \\"gentler\\" side (I refrain from<BR>insulting women, which HE certainly did, by calling<BR>it his \\"feminine\\" side).  Now whether there is also<BR>a fear here of facing up to some subliminal homosocial,<BR>or homosexual impulses, and whether that is a reason<BR>to take him to task as a writer and a person, that<BR>is left up to you to decide.  But that fear, and<BR>the desire to let hints of it out, and yet condemn<BR>it for the sake of himself and his readers and his<BR>acceptability -- while lashing out at women and<BR>the female as the great white \\"Bitc--s\\" is another<BR>negative, in my view. Why lash out at women, if you<BR>are afraid to \\"Know Thyself!\\"???<BR>  True, Hemingway was wounded, probably felt pain,<BR>maybe even some grief -- but then look at what his later<BR>life became after he became successful.  Was his end<BR>the end of a Stoic -- or the end of a weakened, no-longer<BR>Number One idol, fallen from the \\"grace\\" of critical<BR>and public adulation (like a has-been athlete who<BR>is quickly forgotten)?  Of course Hemingway won't<BR>be forgotten -- he got the Nobel Prize, too.  Funny,<BR>no one seems to remember HIS speech. <BR>  Because of the sunlight, the clever irony, the<BR>unforgettable characters, the trout fishing and<BR>readability, this is my \\"favorite\\" among the<BR>Hemingway novels.  I also enjoy very much many of<BR>his short stories, published as THE SHORT STORIES<BR>OF ERNEST HEMINGWAY by Charles Scribner's Sons.<BR>  But locked into Hemingway idolatry? -- no way, \\"man\\"!	2002-03-30

At present on Amazon.com, there are 3 different<BR>editions of the SATYRICON offered.  They are all<BR>excellent...I own all 3.  And if permitted, I plan<BR>to review each of the three individually. This<BR>edition is hard to find, because of its title.<BR>Amazon has indexed it by its title -- SATYRICA -<BR>and thus, it does not come up on searches for<BR>\\"Petronius\\" or \\"Satyricon.\\"  Which is unfortunate,<BR>because it is probably the best of the 3 editions,<BR>with all of its extras.<BR>  There have been many writers who have been influenced<BR>by having read Petronius and the SATYRICON (or SATYRICA).<BR>Some of these writers have even gone so far as to offer<BR>their opinions about Petronius or about the SATYRICON<BR>itself.  One of the excellent features of this edition<BR>of the SATYRICON (published by Univ. of California Press),<BR>translated and with an \\"Introduction\\" by R. Bracht Branham<BR>and Daniel Kinney, is the fact that in the back of the<BR>book they include a section titled \\"Petronius and his<BR>Critics.\\"  In this section, they give provocative quotes<BR>by authors starting with John of Salisbury (12th century)<BR>and extending up through T.S. Eliot in 1932.  What they<BR>may not have known is that Herman Melville also has<BR>a short piece about Petronius in his novel REDBURN,<BR>Chap. 56, in which the narrator of the novel talks about<BR>the hands of his friend Harry Bolton and says: \\"It was <BR>not as the sturdy farmer's hand of a Cincinnatus, who<BR>followed the plough and guided the state, but it was<BR>the perfumed hand of Petronius Arbiter, that elegant<BR>young buck of a Roman, who once cut great Seneca dead<BR>in the forum.\\"<BR>  The SATYRICA (or SATYRICON) contains materials which<BR>might be considered salacious. So that warning should be<BR>noted.  Defenders of Petronius and the SATYRICON are wont<BR>to point out that he does not seem to be presenting the<BR>material as if he is trying to appeal to the prurient<BR>interests of his readers,but that he is rather simply<BR>saying \\"that's the kind of world that's out there, folks.\\"<BR>Some critics have said that Petronius is really being<BR>an ironic satirist and is rubbing Rome's nose in its own<BR>decadence and saying, \\"Look what you 'noble Romans' have<BR>become.\\"  I would like to think that this last is the<BR>case.  He is no prude...no Puritan...but an intelligent,<BR>elegant, ironic, poetic satirist of Rome's lifestyles<BR>of the \\"wannabe\\" wealthy and powerful.  He holds up a<BR>wonderful satirical mirror for them to see themselves --<BR>as only a sharp, clever, intelligent artist might<BR>paint their portraits.<BR>  But the best \\"review\\" of Petronius among the critics<BR>at the back of this book is that by the author J. K.<BR>Huysmans in his work AGAINST NATURE (1884). I would<BR>like to quote part of it as the conclusion of this<BR>review:<BR> \\"Petronius was a shrewd observer, a delicate analyst,<BR>a marvellous painter; dispassionately, with an entire<BR>lack of prejudice or animosity, he described the everyday<BR>life of Rome, recording the manners and morals of his<BR>time in the lively little chapters of the SATYRICON.  Noting<BR>what he saw as he saw it, he set forth the day-to-day<BR>existence of the common people, with all its minor events,<BR>its bestial incidents, its obscene antics.<BR> *  *  *  All this is told with extraordinary vigour and<BR>precise colouring, in a style that makes free of every<BR>dialect, that borrows expressions from all the languages<BR>imported into Rome, that extends the frontiers and breaks<BR>the fetters of the so-called Golden Age, that makes every<BR>man talk in his own idiom ....  There are lightning sketches<BR>of all these people, sprawled round a table, exchanging the<BR>vapid pleasantries of drunken revellers, trotting out<BR>mawkish maxims and stupid saws, their heads turned towards<BR>Trimalchio, who sits picking his teeth, offers the company<BR>chamber pots, discourses on the state of his bowels,<BR>f**ts to prove his point, and begs his guests to make<BR>themselves at home.\\"  [asterisk \\"censoring\\" is mine]<BR>   (pp. 176-177)<BR>  Amazing insight, excellent writing, excellent book --<BR>I will heartily recommend these qualities in this version<BR>of the SATYRICON, and you will have to decide<BR>for yourself whether you wish to peruse Huysmans,<BR>or not.	2002-03-28

If you access the reviews of this work at this site,<br />then you had better be prepared to try to figure out<br />why the other reviewers have written what they have written.<br />  The collections of poems for each poet, and the<br />essay introductions are both excellent.  People who<br />don't know poetry or poets might not find them<br />helpful, but for knowledgable readers of poetry,<br />this Norton Anthology is of high quality, indeed.<br />  I especially like the Norton editions' excellent<br />footnotes.  Here is a footnote to Yeats's poem<br />&quot;To the Rose upon the Rood of Time.&quot;  &quot;The rose, as<br />an image of transfiguration and fulfillment, is a<br />frequent symbol in Yeats's poetry of this period<br />[1892].  In a note dated 1925, he remarks of it<br />'that the quality symbolised as The Rose differs<br />from the Intellectual Beauty of Shelley and of<br />Spenser in that I have imagined it as suffering<br />with man and not as something pursued and seen<br />from afar.' The title indicates, and line 12<br />confirms, that the rose is here eternal beauty,<br />which flowers from the cross of time and sacrifice.&quot;<br />(p. 113)  I think that note is extremely insightful<br />and helpful.  Of course, it also helps greatly if<br />you know who Shelley and Spenser are (and were),<br />what types of works they wrote, and what their<br />most famous works and themes are.  If you have<br />not had that intellectual and educational background,<br />then, of course, the note will seem meaningless.<br />This is an anthology which can be read by scholars<br />and enthusiasts.  Read the poems for their wealth<br />of value and tones and visions -- read the notes<br />and the introductory essays for insightful,<br />meaningful information about the poets, their lives,<br />their struggles, and their accomplishments.<br />  My own favorites in the anthology are: Emily<br />Dickinson, Thomas Hardy, A.E. Housman, some of<br />W.B. Yeats, EdgarLee Masters, Edwin Arlington<br />Robinson, Ezra Pound, H.D., Siegfried Sassoon,<br />Robinson Jeffers, T.S. Eliot, and Wilfred Owen.<br />Of course, there are many more poets and poems<br />than these that appeal to me personally.<br />  Here is a brief excerpt from the beginning of<br />the essay on &quot;Emily Dickinson&quot;:  &quot;Modern American<br />poetry [in this anthlogy there are both American<br />and British poets arranged chronologically according<br />to their birth dates] -- an expression meaning almost<br />the same thing as 'American poetry' -- has for one<br />of its founders and ancestral presences a woman.<br />Emily Dickinson wrote poems which are not only<br />excellent but lend a standard of excellence.  She is<br />bracketed with Walt Whitman because, unknown to each<br />other and almost simultaneously, they all but invented<br />American poetry.&quot;<br />  I cannot understand why anyone could not find that<br />helpful as the beginning of an insightful analysis<br />of the poet, her poetry, and her influence.	2002-03-27

In this Part are the essays: &quot;Feeding<BR>the City: The Organization, Operation,and Scale of the<BR>Supply System for Rome,&quot; &quot;Amusing the Masses: Buildings<BR>for Entertainment and Leisure in the Roman World,&quot; and<BR>&quot;Entertainers in the Roman World.&quot;  Since our modern<BR>era also seems to be so much into shallow entertainment<BR>and pleasures, perhaps the titles of the subsections of<BR>this last chapter will be intriguing: Actors and Athletes.<BR>Chariot Racing.[the factions and their fans sound like<BR>ancient Roman predecessors to the WWF and Nascar <BR>fanatics...] Gladiators, Beast Hunts, and Executions.<BR>[well, we haven't &quot;progressed&quot; in our tastes and<BR>&quot;sophistication&quot; that far yet...but, who knows? ...]<BR>  All in all, this is a very interesting, insightful,<BR>intriguing -- as well as provoking book. The<BR>section that interested me the most was the one<BR>on the Roman emphasis and hang-up on male identity -<BR>what was considered manly, and what was not.  It isn't,<BR>as if that is one of the main obsessions in our own<BR>times in the U.S. of A. , of course.  And what are<BR>all the &quot;manly&quot; types contributing to the betterment,<BR>stability, and nobility of our present society and culture?  <BR>It gives one pause, for reflection.	2002-03-27

But in trying to come to grips with<BR>historians, we have to face what was actually written --<BR>and how succeeding generations of readers and thinkers<BR>reacted to what was actually presented in the works.<BR>Granted that each generation, \\"lost\\" in the murkiness<BR>of its own cultural, political, and social biases may<BR>\\"see\\" different things in the work (poor Melville!!<br />he has been dragged through the Procrustean process<BR>to be everything from Marxist revolutionary to<BR>Existentialist visionary!).  <BR>  It is, of course, instructive to know of Tacitus'<BR>own background and biases.  It gives insightful <BR>perspective with which to understand him, but it<BR>seems pointless to berate him (since he is dead,<BR>and can't \\"change his ways\\" for what he did not<BR>do -- or what he should have done).  There he is --<BR>love him, or leave him.  Learn from him or carp<BR>about him.  Or perhaps do both.  <BR>  One of the aspects which I like about classical<BR>editions are the wonderful \\"Introductions\\" and<BR>\\"Translator's Notes\\" -- if you are in the habit of<BR>passing those by, you really should not.  For they<BR>often contain incredible insights as well as some<BR>terrific writing.<BR>  Here is a brief section from the \\"Translator's<BR>Note\\" on Tacitus' Latin style (just incredibly<BR>wonderful writing by Michael Grant):<BR> \\"The principal cause of this neglect [of Tacitus<BR>in the Middle Ages and in the latter part of<BR>antiquity itself] was unquestionably the unusual and<BR>difficult Latin in which he wrote.  The outstanding<BR>quality of Tacitus is his brilliance as a literary<BR>artist.  Racine called him 'the greatest painter of<BR>antiquity'.  Others have compared his work not so<BR>much to a series of pictures as to a continuous frieze.<BR>But of his supreme artistic genius there can be no<BR>doubt.  A large part of this artistry resides in his<BR>style -- the aspect of his talent which a translator<BR>has least hope of reproducing.  Now ancient readers<BR>usually recognized stylistic talent, and by no means<BR>found that it interfered with their enjoyment when<BR>history contained a strong infusion of rhetoric.  But<BR>the style of Tacitus, as it had developed to its<BR>culminating point in the ANNALS, was indeed extra-<BR>ordinary.  It displays a sharp, astringent and<BR>certainly deliberate contrast to the rotund periods<BR>of Cicero and to the flowing, 'milky' diction of<BR>Livy.\\" [Michael Grant; pp. 24-25.]<BR>  The most interesting and gripping sections of the<BR>work deal with the enigmatic and ambiguous Tiberius.<BR>I especially like the sections on \\"War with the<BR>Germans\\" (and the haunting description of the return<BR>of the Romans to the site of the ambush and massacre<BR>of Varus and his legions by Arminius) and \\"The Reign<BR>of Terror\\" (Tiberius' crack-down on his former right-<BR>hand man Sejanus).  Here is a brief section of that:<BR> \\"Frenzied with bloodshed, the emperor now ordered<BR>the execution of all those arrested for complicity<BR>with Sejanus.  It was a massacre.  Without discrimination<BR>of sex or age, eminence or obscurity, there they lay,<BR>strewn about -- or in heaps.  Relatives and friends<BR>were forbidden to stand by or lament them, or even<BR>gaze for long.  Guards surrounded them, spying on<BR>their sorrow, and escorted the rotting bodies until,<BR>dragged into the Tiber, they floated away or grounded --<BR>with none to cremate or touch them.  Terror had<BR>paralyzed human sympathy.  The rising surge of brutality<BR>drove compassion away.\\"  (p. 209)	2002-03-26

I could attempt to write a review of this work, but<BR>it is so rich, satisfying, informative, and inspiring<BR>a volume that I would rather quote from the back<BR>cover, which seems to me to sum up the perfections of<BR>this compilation.<BR>  \\"GREEK AND EGYPTIAN MYTHOLOGIES features seventy-two<BR>articles, reproduced in full [in English translation]<BR>with illustrations, from the acclaimed two-volume<BR>MYTHOLOGIES. Written by distinguished scholars, the<BR>articles explore a fascinating variety of themes and<BR>topics.  The section on Greek myth surveys mythologies<BR>of creation, power, war, death, and sexuality; articles<BR>on gods, goddesses and their cults bring fresh perspectives<BR>to our understanding of religion in Greek societies.  The<BR>discussions of myth in Egypt are equally wide ranging --<BR>from cosmology, anthropology, ritual, and religion to the<BR>cults of Isis and the fate of the Egyptian gods from the<BR>Middle Ages to the eighteenth century.<BR>  \\"The articles offer illuminating examples of the working<BR>of myth in cultures past and present -- how we create, use,<BR>and are guided by systems of myth to answer fundamental<BR>questions about ourselves and our world: Where do we come<BR>from? Who are we? How shall we live? What happens when we<BR>die?<BR> \\"Building on perspectives developed by such scholars as<BR>Claude Levi-Strauss and Georges Dumezil, and drawing on<BR>such diverse sources as the history of religions, <BR>anthropology, archaeology, literature, and linguistics,<BR>the contributors define a new approach to the study of<BR>myth in society.  Rather than simply cataloging gods<BR>and symbols, the articles in MYTHOLOGIES explore the<BR>complex working of myth in past societies and in our lives<BR>today.\\"<BR>  -- Back Cover.<BR>---------<BR>  The \\"Introduction: The Interpretation of Mythology\\"<BR>is incredibly rich and informative.  It includes the<BR>essays (never dry or dull! -- always extremely interesting<BR>and inspiring) on:Toward a Definition of Myth. The<br />Interpretation of Mythos: Nineteenth and Twentieth-<BR>Century Theories. Myth and Writing: The Mythographers.<BR>Prehistoric Religion. \\"Nomadic Thought\\" and Religious<BR>Action.<BR>  The essays in the rich Part 2 section on Greek mythology<BR>contain such topics (which really interested me) as:<BR>Myth in the Greek City: The Athenian Politics of Myth.<BR>Philosophy and Mythology, from Hesiod to Proclus.  Plato's<BR>Mythology and Philosophy. The Neoplatonists and Greek <BR>Myths.  Greek Cosmogonic Myths.  And these are only some<BR>of the many.<BR>  The Part 3 section on Egypt contains such topics as:<BR>Egyptian Cosmogony.  Egyptian Anthropology.  The Divine <BR>and the Gods in Ancient Egypt.  Egyptian Rituals.  Death<BR>in Egyptian Religion.  Meroitic Religion.  The Cults of<BR>Isis among the Greeks and in the Roman Empire.  Isis<BR>the Magician, in Greek and Coptic Papyruses.  The Fate<BR>of the Egyptian Gods from the Middle Ages to the <BR>Eighteenth Century.  And that is the full list of<BR>titles in that section.<BR>  All in all, this work is even more stimlating and<BR>insightful than Robert Graves, and I would even put<BR>it far ahead of THE LAROUSSE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MYTHOLOGY,<BR>which I also own and use.	2002-03-26

This series is remarkable<BR>in a number of ways.  I especially like the<BR>formatting of the text.

Perhaps<BR>Meyerhold exaggerated because of his frustration -- he<BR>was prevented from ever staging the tragedy by Soviet<BR>dictator Joseph Stalin, who apparently thought it too<BR>dangerous to be performed -- but Meyerhold's sense of<BR>HAMLET's extraordinary breadth of appeal is amply <BR>confirmed by its stage history.  Praised by Shakespeare's<BR>contemporaries for its power to 'please all' [not in<BR>the modern era, 21st century Ameriky on the verge of<BR>sliding into either &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; or &quot;Bladerunner&quot;<BR>barbarism and mediocre diffusion...] as well as to<BR>'please the wiser sort,' it provided his company<BR>with an immediate and continuing success.<BR>  -- Michael Neill.

[This review refers to the Dover Thrift verse<BR> edition of the AENEID translated into English<BR> by Charles J. Billson in 1906.]<br /> As incredible as it may seem, I prefer this<BR>Billson verse translation over that of Allen<BR>Mandelbaum (which I also have in the Bantam<BR>Classic edition, 1970). What causes one person<BR>to like one translation, and another to prefer<BR>someone else's? It is a matter of taste, but<BR>also of conditioning through aesthetic experience<BR>and expectation. I have read a great many poems<BR>in a great many forms. To my sense and sensibility<BR>there is something about the Mandelbaum translation<BR>of the AENEID which is too confining...too clipped...<BR>it does not seem, to me, to flow freely. And yet<BR>Billson's translation has archaic word choices --<BR>but the flow of his translation seems more interesting<BR>and \\"freer\\" than that of Mandelbaum.<BR> Here is a sample of Mandelbaum:<br /> I sing of arms and of a man: his fate<BR> had made him fugitive; he was the first<BR> to journey from the coasts of Troy as far<BR> as Italy and the Lavinian shores.<BR> Across the lands and waters he was battered<BR> beneath the violence of High Ones, for<BR> the savage Juno's unforgetting anger;<BR> and many sufferings were his in war --<BR> [Bantam Classic, 1970.]<br /> And here is Billson in the Dover edition with<BR>the same passage:<br /> Arms and the Man I sing, who first from Troy<BR> A Doom-led exile, on Lavinian shores<BR> Reached Italy; long tossed on sea and land<BR> By Heaven's rude arm, through Juno's brooding<BR> ire,<BR> And war-worn long ere building for his Gods<BR> A Home in Latium: whence [came] the Latin race,<BR> The Lords of Alba, and high-towering Rome.<BR> <BR> To my senses, and sensibility, there is something<BR>about Billson's language and flow which seems to<BR>have more august grandeur -- epic style, sound, and<BR>sweep.<BR> Here is an even more telling example -- the famous<BR>scene in which Aeneas plucks the Golden Bough:<br />[Mandelbaum:] ...just so<BR> the gold leaves seemed against the dark-green<BR> ilex;<BR> so in the gentle wind, the thin gold leaf<BR> was crackling. And at once Aeneas plucks it<BR> and, eager, breaks the hesitating bough<BR> and carries it into the Sibyl's house.<br />[Billson:] So on that shadowy oak the leafy gold<BR> Glimmered, and tinkled in the rustling air.<BR> Forthwith Aeneas grasped the clinging bough,<BR> And plucked, and bare it toward the Sibyl's<BR> cell.<BR> <BR> There seems to me a fineness of poetic sensitivity<BR>there, in Billson, to choose those words just so --<BR>and have the words almost resonate with the sounds<BR>of the objects they are describing.	2002-03-26

One can hardly read any thoughtful analysis or<BR>evaluation of art, artists, even poets, without<BR>coming upon a quote from John Ruskin.  Yet one<BR>may read the quote, realize its acuteness, but<BR>then proceed on -- without really knowing anything<BR>about John Ruskin himself, or about his ideas<BR>and works. That is a tragic loss. Ruskin was an<BR>English art critic and scholar, as well as a <BR>cultural and philosphical historian who<BR>lived from 1819 to 1900.<BR>He attended and graduated from Oxford University,<BR>and in 1869 was appointed first Slade Professor<BR>of Fine Art at Oxford.   <BR>  John Ruskin seems to me to be a combination of<BR>Plato, godly Greek sculptors, and Thoreau.  His<BR>own senses, apparently (just like Thoreau's) were<BR>extremely acute...he has incredible sharpness of<BR>vision.  But even more telling, he has incredible<BR>command of vision and the language to express it<BR>with.  He seems, at times, like a Homer of artistic<BR>cultural and philosophical expression.<BR>  This volume is a compilation of excerpts from<BR>Ruskin's major writings: MODERN PAINTERS I, II,<BR>III, IV, and V/ THE SEVEN LAMPS OF ARCHITECTURE/<BR>THE STONES OF VENICE/ THE TWO PATHS/ UNTO THIS<BR>LAST/ THE CROWN OF WILD OLIVE/ SESAME AND LILIES/<BR>THE QUEEN OF THE AIR/ FORS CLAVIGERA/ FICTION, FAIR<BR>AND FOUL/ THE STORM-CLOUD OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY/<BR>and PRAETERITA. There are multiple excerpts from<BR>each of these works, and each excerpt is followed<BR>by a very helpful citation of the volume, part,<BR>section, and chapter of the work where the excerpt<BR>is found.<BR>  Ruskin is not &quot;merely&quot; an acute analyzer and<BR>evaluator of art and architecture, but he also is<BR>an artistic and ethical philosopher.  His philosophy<BR>seems to have a strong dose of PAGAN GREEK (Plato)<BR>underpinning, which interacts interestingly with<BR>the Evangelical Protestantism overlaid when he<BR>was young by his mother's strict Bible lessons.<BR>His whole lifeseems to have been a struggle<BR>between these two grappling forces, like the<br />statue of &quot;The Wrestlers&quot; from Hellenistic times.<BR>  Ruskin idolized and glorified the painter<BR>Joseph Mallord William Turner [J.M.W. Turner].<BR>He seems to have set out on a crusade while still<BR>a teen-ager (17) by writing an essay defending<BR>Turner and his art -- his admiration, esteem,<BR>and idolatry continued even after he had gone<BR>to Oxford University and began writing his art<BR>criticism works.<BR>  Ruskin's topics sound like a role-call of<BR>classical virtues and perfection seeking -- and<BR>like Thoreau, he bemoans the fact that more<BR>people do not wake up, see intently, and live<BR>better lives.  I personally find Ruskin's admonitions<BR>to be inspiring, rather than merely preachy.  He<BR>obviously has a vision (like a prophet), a wondrous<BR>sense of beauty and appreciation, and a fine mind<BR>and expressive ability which create words of golden<BR>glow.  Yet he also has a heart of reproof towards<BR>the mercantilism of his times (in one speech he<BR>tells his audience that they have two religions,<BR>one which they pay lip-service and tithes to,<BR>and the other religion of their practicality,<BR>the one they actually live by -- and he says:<BR>&quot;...but we are all unanimous about this practical<BR>one; of which I think you will admit that the ruling<BR>goddess may be best generally described as the<BR>'Goddess of Getting-on,' or 'Britannia of the<BR>Market.'&quot;)<BR>  Some of the topic titles in the various sections<BR>give one the flavor of his insights and vision:<BR>&quot;Definition of Greatness in Art&quot;; &quot;That the Truth<BR>of Nature in Not to Be Discerned by the Uneducated<BR>Senses&quot;; &quot;Of Truth of Space&quot;; and &quot;Of the Naturalist<BR>Ideal.&quot;  In his works on architecture, there are<BR>such topic titles as &quot;The Lamp of Truth&quot; and &quot;The<BR>Lamp of Memory.&quot;<BR>  The editor of this volume, John D. Rosenberg, has<BR>done a masterful, insightful job of presenting<BR>Ruskin and his views -- and the Univ.

I personally came to a knowledge, reading, and<BR>study of John Ruskin late -- only during this<BR>past half year.  Though I had come across quotes<BR>attributed to him on various subjects, and though<BR>I had heard mentions of him on various cultural<BR>programs, still nothing enticed me or intrigued<BR>me enough to follow up -- until I came upon <BR>two quotes from him in two very provocative sources.<BR>  The first source was in the ENCYCLOPEDIA AMERICANA<BR> (1994)in an article on \\"Dante Alighieri.\\" The quote<BR>reads:  \\"Each age has admired Dante for different<BR>reasons.  His contemporaries and immediate successors<BR>dwelt on his rhetorical skill and ethical content;<BR>the early 19th century admired his \\"Gothic\\" grandeur;<BR>modern critics have delighted in the sharpness and <BR>variety of his imagery and the subtlety with which he <BR>mingles suggestive allegory with realism.  * * *<BR>Ruskin, speaking surely not for his own time alone,<BR>wrote, 'I think the central man of all the world,<BR>as representing IN PERFECT BALANCE the imaginative,<BR>moral, and intellectual faculties, all at their<BR>highest, is Dante.'\\"<BR>  The other quote is found in Jane Ellen Harrison's<BR>wondrous and elegant presentation of Greek myth<BR>and ritual study -- PROLEGOMENA TO THE STUDY OF<BR>GREEK RELIGION. 1903/1908/1922; rpt. Princeton<BR>Univ. Press, 1991; Mythos Books.  That quote from<BR>the beginning of Chapter 1 says: \\"In characterizing<BR>the genius of the Greeks, Mr. Ruskin says: 'there<BR>is no dread in their hearts; pensiveness, amazement,<BR>often deepest grief and desolation, but terror never.<BR>Everlasting calm in the presence of all Fate, and<BR>joy such as they might win, not indeed from perfect<BR>beauty, but from beauty at perfect rest.\\"  <BR>  This Everyman edition of Ruskin's SELECTED WRITINGS<BR>is also a must-have for one's personal library.<BR>There are wonderful footnotes and notes in the back,<BR>as well as a very helpful chronology.  There are<BR>also extremely insightful and helpful editorial<br />comments and segues within the text itself which<BR>highlight and explain Ruskin's insights and evolving<BR>creativity.  Ruskin's writings are so extensive and<BR>fill so many volumes, that though there may be a<BR>few overlaps of same excerpts in various collections,<BR>they are usually at a minimum.  That is why I was<BR>glad to purchase several different collections of<BR>his writings -- and so far, there is more than<BR>enough new material in each one to have made the<BR>purchases valuable.<BR>  One of the quotes which I especially like from this<BR>volume is this one:<BR>   \\"For the artist who sincerely chooses the<BR>    noblest subject will also choose chiefly to<BR>    represent what makes that subject noble,<BR>    namely, the various heroism or other noble <BR>    emotions of the persons represented.  If, <BR>    instead of this, the artist seeks only to make<BR>    his picture agreeable by the composition of its<BR>    masses and colours, or by any other merely <BR>    pictorial merit, as fine drawing of limbs, it<BR>    is evident, not only that any other subject<BR>    would have answered his purpose as well, but that<BR>    he is unfit to approach the subject he has chosen,<BR>    because he cannot enter into its deepest meaning,<BR>    and therefore cannot in reality have chosen it<BR>    for that meaning.\\"  [from MODERN PAINTERS III;<BR>    p.100 in Everyman]	2002-03-17

If you have never had the pleasure -- and good<BR>fortune -- to discover Will Durant and this series<BR>on THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION, then prepare yourself<BR>for insight, enrichment, and cultural nurturing.<BR>  Few sources concerning history and culture, with<BR>a strongly philosophical underpinning, can enlighten<BR>as does this series.<BR>  Each volume in the series is subdivided into<BR>a number of BOOKS, and each of these subdivisions<BR>is further subdivided into Chapters of various<BR>sections.  But the flow, interest, and detail are<BR>on-going, clear, and stimulating.  These are volumes<BR>not only for scholars but also for general readers<BR>yearning -- longing -- to understand the flow and<BR>interactions of history, culture, and thought.<br />  This volume is number 4 in the series.  The Books<BR>into which it is subdivided are: &quot;The Byzantine<BR>Zenith: A.D. 325-565&quot; -- &quot;Islamic Civilization: <BR>A.D. 569-1258&quot; -- &quot;Judaic Civilization: A.D. 135-<BR>1300&quot; -- &quot;The Dark Ages: A.D. 566-1095&quot; -- &quot;The<BR>Climax of Christianity: A.D. 1095-1300&quot;.<BR>  This volume opens with the Chapter on &quot;Julian<BR>the Apostate&quot; and closes with a lengthy chapter<BR>on &quot;Dante: 1265-1321.&quot;  That is certainly an<BR>interesting span, not only in time, but in<BR>personality and focus, as well.<BR>  The Chapter (38) leading into the Chapter on<BR>Dante (39) is a wondrous, interesting presentation<BR>of &quot;The Age of [Medieval] Romance: 1100-1300.&quot;<BR>It includes sections titled: The Latin Revival;<BR>Wine, Women, and Song; The Rebirth of Drama;<BR>Epics and Sagas; The Troubadours; The Minnesingers;<BR>The Romances; The Satirical Reaction. There are<BR>excellent excerpts from some of the types, as<BR>well as intriguing discussion of how the types<BR>evolved, interacted, and interfused.  Here is<BR>an example of the presentation from &quot;The Romances&quot;:<BR>  &quot;But in romance the middle class had already<BR>   captured the field.  As aristocratic troubadours<BR>   and TROVATORI wrote delicate lyrics for the<BR>   ladies of sourther France and Italy, so in<BR>   northern France the poets of humble birth --<BR>   known to the French as trouveres, or inventors --<BR>   brightened the evenings of the middle and upper <BR>   classes with poetic tales of love and war.<BR>     The typical compositions of trhe trouveres<BR>   were the BALLADE, the LAI, the CHANSON DE GESTE,<BR>   and the ROMAN.&quot;<br />  Durant proceeds to talk about Marie de France<BR>and gives one of her entire lyrics in the text.<BR>He then goes on to discuss the CHANSONS DE GESTE<BR>and their successors, the ROMAN (or Romances).<BR>There are excellent sections on the writers <BR>Walther von der Vogelweide, Chretien de Troyes,<BR>Wolfram von Eschenbach, Gottfried of Strasbourg,<BR>and Hartmann von Aue. This chapter serves as a<BR>excellent, rich, historical and cultural background<BR>for the chapter on Dante which follows.<BR>  The chapter on Dante is divided into the sections:<BR>The Italian Troubadours; Dante and Beatrice; The<BR>Poet in Politics; and a final full and rich section<BR>on THE DIVINE COMEDY, itself. One excerpt from the<BR>text cannot be passed by, without quotation:<BR>  &quot;In the epic of Dante's life, his exile was<BR>   his hell, his studies and his writings were<BR>   his purgation, his hope and love were his<BR>   redemption and his only bliss.  Virgil, who<BR>   guides Dante through hell and purgatory stands<BR>   for knowledge, reason, wisdom, which can lead<BR>   us TO the portals of happiness; only faith<BR>   and love can lead us IN.&quot;<BR>  <BR>  Wondrous, incredible, satisfying...	2002-03-17
