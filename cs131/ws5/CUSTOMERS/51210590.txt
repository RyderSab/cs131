However, that is just one aspect of the storyline.<br /><br />Francine Amen finds herself in a mental treatment facility following a nervous breakdown precipitated by her best friend's suicide. She is despondent and feels guilty because she was responsible for Toni leaving her family and joining a traveling ministry led by a minister who was a wolf in sheep's clothing. Francine rejected Toni's claim that Brother Payne had impregnated her. Now Francine's sister, Dawn, has come to Ohio to bring her back home to Georgia, back to their family home-and back to the church home she left where she had rebuked the congregation and possibly burned her bridges.<br /><br />Francine was engaged to Sylvester Ray when she up and left town to join Bishop Payne's traveling ministry. Her fraternal twin Dawn and Sly then began seeing each other and soon married. Together they operate the Amen-Ray Funeral Home business that was started by both of their grandparents. There has always been a sense of competition and sibling rivalry between the sisters but Dawn is determined to be there for her sister in her darkest hour. However, Dawn must contend with the discord in her home and marriage. She is trying to deal with Sly's betrayal as he professes to love her and make things right. It does not take long for Francine to discover there is serious tension between her sister and Sly.<br /><br />Francine begins working at Mother Harris' bookstore, slowly trying to put her life back together as well as make peace with the way she left Faith Central; she had condemned them in a self-righteous manner. Additionally, she has to face Toni's family, the Roberts, who are angry with her, blaming Francine for Toni's suicide. George, Toni's brother is especially bitter and attempts to discredit her in every way he can.<br /><br />There are others in Francine's corner though; Mother Harris, Rev. Thomas of Faith Central and Stuart, Sly's best friend, who all try to encourage her faith and strength in the Lord. Francine also befriends Monika, a teenager who works at the bookstore and her mother, Delores. She is drawn into the mother and daughter's dilemma when Monika's desire to know her father's identity threatens the fabric of the lives of some prominent people.<br /><br />This reviewer found myself frustrated at times with the various storylines as well as the characters, particularly Francine. I needed to know what motivated her over-zealous, self-righteous attitude but to her credit her character did show quite a bit of growth. Additionally, I found the reaction to the infidelity and adultery of a trusted member of the congregation a little too laid back, not to mention the adulterer's reasoning of \\"it just happened\\" as an affront to everyone's intelligence. Then there is the matter of seemingly not an eyebrow was raised to the fact that the minute Francine left town, Dawn scooped up her man.<br /><br />That said, without the aforementioned scenarios, there would not have been the story that it was and true to Benson's style, she is a good storyteller. Known in the mid-90s for her intriguing romance stories with Arabesque, this author seems to have found her niche in Christian fiction. This reviewer also appreciates the fact that her characters are intelligent, upwardly mobile African Americans grounded in a sense of family, community, business and social awareness. The insular world of church folk, including Mother Harris, the voice of reason, like so many Mothers of the church with whom so many of us can identify is presented in a realistic manner. Minister adultery/sexual abuse is tackled as an ongoing issue that needs to be and is being recognized and addressed in churches. The strength of this book is in the writing and the hard lessons learned-God's grace notwithstanding. Fans of this author should be pleased.<br /><br />Dera R.

Have you looked back at your journal entries and thought, this is just too good for my eyes only; everybody needs to know? Well, that is the concept of The Power Journal: Chronicle of a Revolutionary Black Woman in White America by WASET who gives it to you raw, real, straight, no chaser and no excuses<br /><br />WASET is a young woman who speaks her mind on the ballot and the bullet, brothers hitting on White women at the Essence Festival and \\"turrible\\" service at one of Magic Johnson's restaurants in Los Angeles. Her writings include the 2003 California governor recall and the election of movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger as the next head of the state and all the madness surrounding it; dissecting the Whitney Houston and Diane Sawyer interview, replete with fabricated receipts for crack cocaine; and R. Kelly's bump and grind saga.<br /><br />Much of this author's poetry starts out lyrical and deep but soon turns into an angry rant; for example, The Lost King of the Nile becomes a seething tirade about Black men craving White women. The Lost Queen of the Nile actually fares better and was beautifully written. Some of the poetry, as most of the essays, appears to be remnants of everyday thoughts, not unlike the blogs we are seeing more of on a daily basis. The journal entries are numbered and the topics are endless and limitless.<br /><br />This journal that has a stark black cover with gold lettering can be interpreted as either a statement of a powerful, articulate woman who has much insight and even more to say or as one long, continuous rant of the typical, angry, black woman. Read it and decide for yourself.<br /><br />Dera Williams<br /><br />APOOO BookClub	2005-07-05

The unnamed narrator is a Buppie who has got it all; a career in medical research, a beautiful home in the Los Angeles hills and a beautiful wife with whom he is crazy in love. Genevieve; zhawn-vee-ehv, that is how she wants her name pronounced. This is just one precise thing about this woman who is beautiful, educated and accomplished. Married two years, the couple is brought face-to-face with their pasts when a phone call in the night sends them to rural Alabama to confront their present.<br /><br />At first Genevieve intends to travel alone to bury her maternal grandmother but her husband who knows nothing of her family insists on going with her. This trip proves to reveal the cracks in the fa√ßade they have been living as all is revealed. In flashback we learn of the narrator's childhood in Texas with his mother and the tragic accident that changed his life and his move to Fresno, California to live with his grandparents. The pain of his loneliness and insecurities are also revealed as well as his frustration with the couple's intimacy or lack thereof. It is indeed his insatiable sexual appetite and intensity that threatens the core of his marriage.<br /><br />Genevieve must face her demons and when she reunites with the assorted personalities in her family, a Pandora's Box of secrets is opened. There is white Grandpa Fred, who has a Confederate flag and is confined to a wheelchair. There are her various brothers and then there is Kenya. Sexy, sassy and feisty, she brings on the drama replete with tattoos and a motorcycle driving boyfriend. Genevieve is transformed before her husband's eyes from a sophisticated, assured woman to a little girl who hurts, cries and loses control. Who are these people?<br /><br />EJD does it again. His complex and intense characterizations and dialogue are realistic, the settings are peppered with detailed imagery and his prose is filled with beautiful language and metaphors. His impeccable research with attention to detail is evident. It all fits together in the telling of the story, the racial and sexual politics, the hypocrisy of race in America, the human frailties that make us just people who are caught up in events and circumstances not of our own making but by virtual of our individual and collective histories. Readers are kept on their toes with unexpected twists and turns, straight through to the very end. It is amazing how the author can write a book that covers a span of about two or three days that in reality explores a lifetime.

Viveca has endured the hardships of marriage to a drug abuser and her twin sons, Elijah and Elgin, have brought her grief with their scrapes with the law. Iralaun, a self-absorbed, baggage carrying college student is sleeping with her roommate's boyfriend and then meets the perfect guy. A juvenile court judge, Belinda is plagued with bad relationships and finds herself being used by her current man. She then meets a cop who wants her but is still clinging to hope of reconciliation with his wife.<br /><br />Viveca's life is drudgery; working odd hours as a nurse, cooking and caring for four children who are left unsupervised and plagued with memories of the pain and abused suffered from her ex-husband, Eddie. Her twins resent her for their father not being in their lives while their father is yet fighting his addictions. Viveca just cannot seem to get ahead to the point she has let herself go physically and mentally. She feels she has been let down by her marriage and by her church. Iralaun finds in Allen a man of character but does she deserve him? Her mother died without ever revealing the name of her father. Belinda is forced to reflect on her relationships while coming to grips with her disabled father's self-imposed isolation from his family.  Eventually these characters are connected by fate and circumstances.<br /><br />My online book club eagerly anticipated reading this book as our March selection, believing that the same competition that gave an award to such a wonderful book as The Darkest Child would surely be worth reading. We however were sorely disappointed. First of all, the book was poorly edited. Numerous misspelled words, wrong synonym usage, wrong verb placement, and grammatical errors were throughout the text. This was distracting and interrupted the flow. Secondly, the comments from my book club members were that the characters were stilted, underdeveloped and we just did not feel anything for them. With the exception of the twins, we could care less. Additionally the sequence of events and the intertwining of the three stories seemed to be forced, as to prove the theory of six degrees of separation. I agonized over both giving this book a fair, critical review and rating it impartially, debating between giving it a 2 or 3 as my APOOO rating was a 2.5. Perhaps with better line and structure editing, this manuscript in revised form will be a better product.<br /><br />Dera Williams<br /><br />APOOO BookClub, underdeveloped and we just did not feel anything for them.

In the space of a few days, she catches her man cheating with her so-called friend, loses her job and faces possible eviction. What's a girl to do? In Trista Russell's debut, Going Broke, Sarai hops on a plane to the Bahamas, what else? The trip, already planned and prepaid is where she gets a solution to her problems. Enter cool, suave Conrad who hands her a proposition she cannot refuse; acting as an escort to wealthy black men. Sarai is at first insulted but as she contemplates her bank balance and realizes the payment for her Alzheimer's afflicted father's nursing home is due, she reconsiders.<br /><br />Meanwhile the attractive guy she met at the masquerade party prior to her trip resurfaces when she visits her sister friend, Natalya at the school where she teaches. The fact that he is a janitor becomes less important after spending time with him. Tremel Colten is a spoken word artist and songwriter with ambitions of becoming a singer if he can only get that lucky break. Sarai is determined to help him but her greatest fear is that he will find out about her secret life. It is becoming harder to juggle her two worlds and she vows to get out but, alas there are too many skeletons rattling in her closet and people who are trying to trip her up at every turn. There is the record producer brother who holds the key to the big time for Tremel but what price would Sarai have to pay and with what? Then there is her ex, Damian, a stockbroker/drug dealer and the devastating news she receives from her twin brother, Savion. And not in the least is Sarai's indomitable need for both the mean greens and revenge. A visit to Ohio to finally meet Tremel's family brings a startling shock.<br /><br />This book was an enjoyable, pleasant surprise; the story was well written and engaging. Though it is fiction, this reviewer has no doubt that the escort business is prevalent among the rich and famous.

He lived under the shadow of a man for whom he was named but did not know; a man bigger than life and a man he did not meet until he was ten years old.<br /><br />That \\"Barry\\" struggled with his identity was no small wonder. He was the product of white mother and an African father living with white grandparents in Hawaii. As a teen he sought out other kids of African American descent, not always fitting in, always trying to find his place. However, Obama came from a family of love--- from both sides. His maternal grandparents bestowed affection and care on him, sacrificing and taking care of him. When he finally met his paternal siblings as an adult, they embraced him as an Obama.<br /><br />After living in New York after college, Obama found his calling in Chicago in organizing neighborhoods for action and independence. He turned down a well-paying executive position to run a program to roll up his sleeves and go in the trenches working with the poor and disenfranchised. After several years he decided to go to law school, but first he made the trek to the home of his father in Kenya. It was there among his brothers, sisters, cousins, and aunties, he came to know who Barack Obama, the man was. Although his father was dead, Obama learned of the the legacy, pain, hopes, dreams and demons of this man.<br /><br />I found the many pages devoted to his community organizing at times tedious yet my book club members, some of whom had worked in similar positions, emphasized the importance of these chapters in his life as it has been evidenced with his emergence as a national leader. However, the history and landscape of Kenya was at the heart of this memoir for this reviewer. An extra bonus to this updated version of this book first written in 1995 is Obama's keynote speech at the Democratic convention in July 2004.

Singer takes readers on a thrilling ride in this adventure packed urban tale in her new novel, A Landlord's Tale, set in the 1970s. Amos Brown has inherited two brownstone apartment buildings in Harlem from his late father, a man he has never known. Along with the buildings, he has also inherited an assorted cast of residents, a motley crew reminiscent of characters from the television shows, Good Times and 227. There is the \\"super\\", Seltzer, who runs the place and does the maintenance and proceeds to tell Amos what needs to be done. There is Wilbur \\"The Fag\\" a drag queen with a good heart, Miss Ellie, a former Cotton Club dancer, Patty, a young mother with a sickly baby girl and Zeke, an old Trinidadian, who terrorizes the others with his brand of voodoo.<br /><br />Amos sees this sudden opportunity of becoming a landowner as a stroke of luck, as he wants to give up the con games and gambling life and go straight. But as the Bible says, \\"When I would do good, evil is always present.\\" First of all it takes money to maintain property and Amos finds himself running short. Enter Harry, a West Indian drug king, who is also the uncle of the woman, Catherine, Amos has fallen for. She is a hard working woman, different from the gold digging wife he is separated from whom by the way needs a place to stay. Being a landlord is tough. The kid in the lower unit across the street has a lot of activity going on; people coming and going at all hours. And now Harry wants him to do a drop off, just a one time deal. Amos wrestles with his demons as he considers all the possibilities. If that is not enough, a body is unearthed by construction workers in front of the building across the street. Could the woman be his dead mother, who disappeared when he was a child? He needs to confront the aunt, his mother's sister, with whom he has a strained relationship.<br /><br />Reminiscent of the 70s Sidney Poitier and Bill Cosby movies, Uptown Saturday Night and Let's Do it Again, this wild and wacky story was a fun read.

Poignant, compelling, luminous, this novel told in epistle form is a moving account of a young couple in love and their struggle to maintain a relationship while the young man, seventeen years old, is incarcerated for a horrendous crime. The first words Antonio writes to Natasha is \\"Baby, do you believe I killed my daddy?\\" Thus begins a correspondence that spans almost ten years.<br /><br />In their letters beginning in January 1990, Natasha and Antonio look back at their courtship against the landscape of their beloved Harlem. Their escapades on the subway, their favorite playing fields, and their indifference to their school assignments are now precious memories. Both of them,  products of working-class families, have had less than favorable living conditions, Natasha is frustrated as she witnesses her mother's diminishing self-image caused by her live-in boyfriend. There was a time before the death of Natasha's father that they were a nuclear family and had happy times. Antonio has a depressed father who hid his pain with alcohol, lashing out at his family. Natasha is part fly girl but with one foot in church as she struggles with the values of her religious grandmother.<br /><br />Over the next several months, the couple's love is tested time after time compounded by Antonio's trial, loneliness for the both of them and tragic family situations. Antonio fights to maintain his sanity as he is befriended by two hard-core cons that protect and school him in how to sustain prison life. Natasha, now more focused on school, is rewarded with opportunities that expand her view of a world beyond Harlem. Antonio is no longer ashamed of his thirst for knowledge and book learning, devouring every text he can get his hands on. As the months grow into years the questions remains, can love conquer all? How well does Natasha know the boy to whom she has pledged her heart?<br /><br />This book moved this reviewer on so many levels as this novel, little more than 200 pages, addressed issues of social, economic, inequities of the judicial system and matters of the heart. It was a pleasure to meet the author, Kalisha Buchanon, at her book signing in Oakland. A gracious young woman, she is to be commended for bringing dignity and integrity to urban fiction at a time when so much of this genre is thrown at us with sensationalism and caricature like images.

Nancy Rawles, a writer and history teacher, took issue with the way the highly controversial book by Mark Twain was portrayed in the schools in Seattle, her adopted town. She began researching which included a trip to Hannibal, Missouri where Hick Finn takes place and years of reviewing slave narratives and the slavery culture. Rawles constructed her story around a passage in Huck Finn that expressed Jim's desire for freedom for himself and his family. Taking literary license, she tells the story through the eyes of Jim's wife, Sadie, as she relays her memories of the man she loved to her granddaughter who is contemplating marriage as they piece a quilt over a twelve-day period.<br /><br />Sadie was at the birth of Jim, toting water for the midwife. She was barely high as a barrel but the life of a slave child was so that they began toiling from the time they were able to grasp a cup. Sadie and Jim lived on Mas Watson's plantation in Missouri. Sadie watched Jim grow as she also watched the people she loved leave her either through death or by being sold away never to be seen again. In rich details the hard life of back-breaking labor and the beatings endured by the slaves is meticulously told. Slaves were no more than cattle, scratching for food just to survive and for mating and producing more slaves for the master. The most ragged of apparel was hard to come by to keep themselves clothed and they had to condition themselves not show pain when their children were sold away from them.<br /><br />Reading a book about slavery can be a drain mentally but Rawles' language was fluid and luminous, so much so, I felt like I was walking through the woods gathering the leaves from the sassafras trees and plant roots from which Sadie made her \\"cures\\". I could hear the cadence of the many tongues of the slaves who came from different points of the African continent to the plantation in New Roads, Louisiana where Sadie was sold later on in her life. Though written in dialect without contractions and no punctuation other than the period, it was surprisingly readable for this reviewer. The references to the culture of Africa were highlighted throughout the book such as the dance rituals and belief systems of Sadie and the other slaves that were held in their souls.<br /><br />I met Rawles last year when she came to Oakland for her signing of Crawfish Dreams and as she talked about this new release, she conveyed a sincerity of what she was trying to accomplish with this book. She took artistic allowance as she gave voice to Jim as more than the savior and companion to Huck Finn, but a man of flesh and blood who had hopes and dreams of seeking the elusive quest of freedom and to love and care for his family as a man. This was a love story of Sadie and Jim who promised to love each other always, a testament to those who could be beat down but not broken despite not knowing when they would be torn from the one they loved.  \\"If slaves can love, then free people should love....\\" Sadie tells Marianne, her granddaughter as she bestows tangible pieces of her past to complete the quilt they have been piecing. A button from her beloved Lizabeth, a shard from the cup that held her potions and a scrap of  Jim's hat, all of which symbolized the mosaic of her fractured life. This slim volume is packed with powerful meaning that deserves to be a classic.<br /><br />Dera Williams<br /><br />APOOO BookClubLouisiana where Sadie was sold later on in her life.

Part Indian folklore and Western shoot-em-up, part mythology, and a love story with a Shakespearian twist; this novel has issues of family drama and loyalty, mixed-race issues, racial conflict and history. The authors deftly weave in and out of past and present with parallel storylines of present day and the late 1800s.<br /><br />Darren and Morgan are half brothers, sharing the same mother while Morgan's father is black and Native American. Their Cain and Abel relationship is volatile and spurned by Butch, Darren's friend, who has always been jealous of the brothers' relationship and never misses a chance to cause dissension between them. Butch abuses his wife Lotus, who, lonely in her marriage, finds solace in Darren's bed. Morgan loves his wife, Janice and therefore agrees to her plan to go away on a retreat to confront and strengthen his relationship with his brother. So they travel from their California home to a remote area of Texas where they meet Chuddy, an old Native American man who enthralls them with the legend of the Black Seminoles and Creek Indians<br /><br />Everyone's motive for going on the retreat is different. Butch, a slum landlord and closet racist, thinks he is fooling everyone; Morgan, the \\"half-breed, whose bloodline is Black and Seminole is filled with revenge for Butch that causes him to commit an act that can possibly change his life. Darren, who shares a mother with Morgan but both loves and hates his brother while also coveting his wife. This trip can either make or break their bond.<br /><br />According to the legend as told by Chuddy, Morning Littlejohn, a Black Seminole, has suffered the worst kind of pain when he returns to the village and finds his wife slain and his children kidnapped. He fears he will never love again until he meets Jae, who is posing as a boy so she can work for the whites in town. Jacy Akando, a Creek Indian, saw his father killed and was abandoned by his mother, always feeling the pain of those losses. The white lawmen pit the Native men against each other, charging Akando with killing Morning, who they call \\"The Black Demon.\\"<br /><br />The juxtaposition of two parallel storylines of brotherly rivalry, loyalty, love and death, vengeance and redemption amidst the Texas landscape deserves recognition and definitely has cross-over appeal. Gardner and McGriff are to be commended for bringing the culture and history of the Black Seminoles in a multilayered storyline.

She intrigues a group of young women with her tale about the Robinson family, who were her friends and neighbors during the 1960s and 70s.<br /><br />Brenda, Cora and Annette are three sisters who have been raised by their industrious mother, Laura, in St. Petersburg, Florida. Brenda, the oldest has always been the practical one and the do-gooder of the family. Cora, the middle child, is the wild child, New Ager, with an artistic and Afro centric bent. Annette, the youngest is God-fearing and innocent. The sisters are close--- that is until Michael Dawson moves into their rental house. He was a college classmate of Brenda, who secretly has a crush on him but it is baby sister Annette who falls hook, line and sinker for this good looking brother.<br /><br />Before she commits herself fully, however, she is drawn to missionary work in Africa and her sisters decide to go with her. Weeks turn into months as the three sisters entrench themselves in the African village where they teach and administer to the sick. When an epidemic encompasses the community, tragedy strikes and the Robinson sisters are separated for the first time when only one of them returns to St. Petersburg. Cora, riddled with guilt, returns home several years later, exasperating Brenda with her free spirit and devil may care attitude. Brenda is further frustrated when Cora becomes the object of Michael's desire. Cora, a citizen of the world cannot be tamed as she takes off for Africa yet again.<br /><br />Nebia ends each vignette with suspense that has her audience hanging on to hear the next episode as they also comment on the happenings of the Robinsons. As Nebia interweaves the culture and climate of the 60s and 70s, readers are privy to the African American community of St. Petersburg including racial conflict, church issues, community problems and the geography and development of the city. At times, incidents seemed rushed and contrived, especially an over dramatized ending. However, Snoe get kudos for spinning a tale of family drama that enlightens and informs her readers. She will surely garner new fans with this offering.<br /><br />Dera Williams<br /><br />APOOO BookCluba interweaves the culture and climate of the 60s and 70s, readers are privy to the African American community of St. Petersburg including racial conflict, church issues, community problems and the geography and development of the city.

Her story details the racism and politics of growing up Black in the 1950s and 1960s.<br /><br />The story is actually a memoir of both parents. Her mother, Josephine was born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama. Though she grew up in Jim Crow conditions, her middle-class family life sheltered her from the most hideous racism. She was taught to hold her head up and not bow down to Whites. She went on to attend Spellman College in Atlanta. Josephine was known for her exquisite dress and style; at one time she dreamed of becoming a fashion designer. She eventually though became a librarian and school teacher.<br /><br />Charles Stokes was born in Kansas, a staunch Republican state. He was the son of a preacher and came from a community of hard working, Black folk who had migrated from the Deep South to build a life free from racism and to educate their children. Charles and his brothers went to college, he himself went to law school and after working for a number of government agencies, and working for the Republican party, moved to Seattle. There he continued his work in the Republican party, working with prominent men including Richard Nixon. He eventually went into politics, running for Lt. Governor of Washington, which he lost and eventually became a legislator.<br /><br />Stephanie grew up in integrated neighborhoods in Seattle, went through the usual teen-age angst and self-centered behavior. She clashed with her mother over wearing a natural hair style and the Black Power movement. She also clashed with her father over his conservative views about Negroes  progress in a changing America. She recounts that she was ridiculed one election year when she was the only Negro child to admit her parents were voting for the Republican candidate. There are memories of church life in Seattle and family trips, particularly one road trip where they were pulled over in Texas and questioned about their late model car.<br /><br />This was a poignant look at a girl and her family growing up in the United States with the duality of everyday life as an American family not unlike the Donna Reed Show or Leave it to Beaver only in shades of Black that definitely gave it more color in lessons of life.<br /><br />Dera Williams<br /><br />APOOO BookClubor the Republican candidate.

It is all so perfect. But the saying about the best laid plans..... becomes a reality when a monkey wrench is thrown into the mix.<br /><br />Alfonse Mitchell is Salamanca's father and Ben's employer. He is a respected community leader in Washington D.C. and a successful restaurateur but he has a dark side and that side is revealed to Ben one night when he is asked to accompany Mitchell on a run after the restaurant closes. Before Ben can rationalize it all out, this son of a deceased D.C. policeman is caught up in a drama not of his own making. In short order, he is set up to take the fall for felony burglaries and is sent off to do seven years time, leaving behind a pregnant Salamanca.<br /><br />In jail, he has convinced himself the music is no longer a part of him, his only lifeline is the letters and pictures he receives from Salamanca that lets him know of her love. Yet, she at eighteen must run for her life, fleeing from a madman, her father, who wants the memory of Ben Baker erased from their life, even the baby growing within his only child.  Salamanca goes into hiding to Atlanta, and then to Detroit, her native home, changing her identity. It is there she faces the truth about the demons of her father when she visits the home where she last lived with him and her missing mother. As all the pieces fall together, she realizes that she is in it alone until Ben is released.<br /><br />Ben gets through his sentence first by writing songs, then reading and keeping himself strong, living for the day he returns to his girls, Salamanca and now Sasha, his baby daughter. When he is released, his best friend Steve, now wealthy from the music that once Ben was a part of, picks him up from prison and takes him to Los Angeles. Steve's plan is to show Ben the kind of life that he could have if only he would succumb to the music he has left behind. But Ben has a one-track mind and that is to get back to D.C. where he is to reunite with Salamanca and Sasha. Alphonse Mitchell, who has been incognito for the last seven years, also heads to D.C. area. He wants to see his daughter and possibly tie up loose ends with Ben. A series of events sets off a suspenseful plot that keeps the reader on edge until the end.<br /><br />With well-rounded characterizations and excellent writing exhibited, Jasper has a flair for vivid imagery and well-crafted language.  Urban/hip-hop fiction is taken to a whole other level in this talented writer's hands, proving that the disrespect that that genre sometimes receives is not warranted in this case. This is literature period, at its best and this reviewer looks forward to Jasper's next adventure.

At the apex of the storyline is St. William Rawle, whose witty epistles at the beginning of each story, is a window into the soul of the book.<br /><br />The stories extend over a century beginning in early 1900s.  In the High Priest of Love, Eddie Blackwell is an American priest with an  interracial background of black and white parentage. He has gained the respect and trust of the locals while all along he is fighting the demons of his lust when he chucks it all and takes sail on a ship. There he encounters his underage lover, Eugenia, who is of mixed blood and able to pass for white and Rosalyn, a woman who is classified as a lady of pleasure and dark-skinned, who both vie for his affections and his soul. What happens on that ship is the catalyst for the ensuing storyline.<br /><br />The Girl with the Golden Shoes is symbolic on so many levels. Estrella Thompson's dreams of books and learning literally drive her from her small, backward village onto a sojourning quest of self-awareness.  Her travels take her to a village of East Indians, through a tribe of Caribe Indians, among Island blacks, Creole Spanish and Whites where she learns the hierarchy of racial superiority. Her quest for the shoes that will give her the respect and status she desperately seeks will also give her the backbone and tenacity to become the kind of woman that will chart her own course despite her African heritage. Relationships and love was a reoccurring theme and it was not always acceptable love by society's standard. Incest and lesbianism were handled with sensitivity and a poignant carefulness that explored the frustrations of women and men who are bound by tradition. In the title story, Passing Through, we meet Rebecca who is Arab and Cornelia, an American Black, among a myriad cast of other characters of various ethnicities and cultures who come together at a dinner party that becomes prophetic.<br /><br />The witty Poetic Justice in present day San Marcos will have readers guessing just how much poetic license the author took with his characters, as they are strikingly familiar. Blacks of the Diaspora are featured as they are in Revolution (anthologized in After Hours edited by Robert Fleming) and throughout the book. As a matter of fact, the global nature and sense of place in this well-written book is as much a part of the author as was related at his book signing at Marcus Book Store in Oakland. Channer waxed philosophically about his writing process and how this book came to be. He was very adamant about his feelings regarding Black writers expanding their scope in writing about characters who are other than Black, as it is known that White writers feel very comfortable writing about us.<br /><br />Superb and lyrical, this reviewer reread passages over and over, not because it was difficult but because I became lost in the fluid language and the eloquent handling of prose and wanted to read out loud. The whole time, characters, theme and setting are knitted and threaded together and seemingly meshed in a logical and satisfying ending. As in his last novel, Satisfy My Soul, this is a work of literary art that should be appreciated and promoted to crossover appeal.

How we feel about ourselves, our families, our relationships. So they set out to interview dozens of women to find out just what makes us tick. They found women who were willing to tell it like it is, straight, no chaser and uncensored.<br /><br />While traditionally Black women have upheld Black men in their distress, today's woman is not always willing to nurse a man's wounded ego or insecurities at the expense of sacrificing her career or her heart. Ayoka, a professional woman, decided to end her frustrating marriage when it became apparent her husband had ongoing issues about the money she made and how she spent it.<br /><br />Other topics covered are childhood, sex, dating, motherhood and friendship among other topics; all told in the women's own insightful words. There were discussions about the joy of motherhood and the pain of finding out their husbands cheated on them. One woman found out the woman next door, who was supposedly her friend, was having an affair with her husband. Others though were very candid about their own infidelities as well as dating married men. One particularly laugh out loud discourse had this reviewer just shaking my head at some of the antics. One woman told how she became angry at her married lover for buying his wife a new house and then when she found out he was cheating on her with yet another woman went to that woman's house and defaced his car.<br /><br />There is a detailed section about sex, the first time, what kind, how women want it, and sex vs. making love. Self-image and self-esteem; how these women view themselves and the trials of finding themselves are discussed with candor. The recipes sprinkled throughout the text were an added bonus as the authors likened recipes for food to recipes for life. These recipes were culled straight from their mother's Louisiana kitchen. Gumbo and crawfish etouffee' were two of the mouth-watering treats that were symbolic of the spicy wit and frankness exhibited by bold and beautiful Sisters<br /><br />The authors wrote a short introduction and closing but I would have liked to see more of their own comments.

A psychologist and radio personality/columnist, things were looking good. Hope is considering an offer to host a television talk show and the man that she loves has asked her to marry him.

And then there is the little matter of her husband's past affair which she thought she had made peace with. When Rebecca takes the bold step to take a vacation alone to decide where her life is going, she has no idea she will encounter the beautiful cultural traditions of Edisto Island. She embraces the island, the colorful people and culture and in doing so, she takes up the cause of preserving the island and the culture from encroaching land developers. But on the island there is also temptation.<br /><br />Theo Howell, a renowned writer has had three younger siblings practically dropped into his lap. His deceased mother may not have been a parent to him, but he is determined to do right by his younger siblings. In working through his issues of raising three grieving, resentful teenagers and dealing with his own issues of abandonment, he now realizes how isolated he has been until he comes in contact with  a beautiful, intelligent woman on the island.  Can these three souls find what they are looking for on this beautiful island?<br /><br />The food, settings, culture and island sites are a travel log of Edisto Island. Secondary characters, residents of Edisto Island, are enchanting as they share cultural aspects such as basket weaving and fishing. This reviewer, who has always been fascinated with the Sea Islands was pulled into the settings and delighted in learning that the Gullah and Geechee people are one and the same.

He has also delighted his fans with an ode to black women in Why I Love Black Women. In this body of work, Mercy Mercy Me, he explores the arts loves and demons of Marvin Gaye, one of the greatest singers of all time. This however, is not a biography in the traditional sense of how biographies are usually constructed. While accounts of Gaye's life from birth to death are chronicled, this writing is more of an analysis of the life of a man who essentially plotted his own death. When Gaye's father pulled the trigger in April 1984, twenty years ago, ironically the gun was the one he gave his father for protection.<br /><br />Marvin Gaye was a genius, born to a fanatically religious father who ruled his home and family as a dictator. He was cruel, issuing beatings for the smallest infraction to both his wife and children. While the others buckled under the heat, Marvin, the most talented, rebelled and received the lion's share of punishment. He both loved and reviled his father, who was sexually deviated, yet proclaimed to be holier than thou.  Marvin was a victim of his total upbringing, a loving, beaten down-trodden mother who coddled him and a sadistic father, who withheld his love. We learn of the psychological and emotional background of his Pentecostal father, Rev. Marvin P. Gaye and of what really went on behind the scenes.<br /><br />Marvin loved women; he married Berry Gordy's sister, Anna, but it was a troubled marriage complicated by their age differences and her inability to have children. Yet, a son was produced--- that was Marvin's child-- sanctioned by the Gordys who had their own code of conduct for living that did not adhere to society's acceptable rules. In Gaye, we see a tortured soul as we learn how religion, sex and race intersected and became as one in his music and his life. There were women and more women. There was Tammy Terrell and depending on whom you talk to they were lovers or they were brother and sister. Also, there was a second wife, Janice.<br /><br />The album that brought Marvin Gaye into mainstream American, What's Going On, was at first rejected by Berry Gordy as too radical but it was not to be denied. With the war in Viet Nam, the civil rights and free love movements, this album spoke volumes about the world in which we lived and that Marvin embraced. His music was his life and his life was music. Through careful text, Dyson takes us through a journey of how each album came to be. Here My Dear, Trouble Man, Let's Get it On were works of labor from a genius who was in a constant state of emotional turmoil<br /><br />If you are looking for a straight biography of Gaye and his life from birth to death, this is not the text. There are several biographies on the market and Dyson highly recommends a few. At times the writing was dense with scholarly criticism and clinical terminology. However, it is offset by revealing commentaries such as an excellent chapter on the comparison and contrast of Marvin Gaye and R. Kelley which this reviewer found fascinating. The similarities are surprising and alarming and quite revealing when looking into the black family and community. Additionally, critical review of African Americans' attitudes on slavery and how black women are viewed in the black community is forthright, stunning and at times shameful. This manuscript will be long remembered and studied as a tool for looking into the life of a man who was an enigma even to himself. As always, Dyson delivers in his own style.<br /><br />Dera Williams<br />APOOO BookClub<br />Marcus Book Club (Oakland)and depending on whom you talk to they were lovers or they were brother and sister.

How does an eleven year-old girl deal with the abandonment of her mother? How can the pain be lessened?  It cannot but Angela Davis Brown learns to navigate the terrain of pain and mistrust by growing to trust her father, a father who sometimes is ill-equipped to care for a girl child. Teddo, a magician-- almost unheard of in the black community-- holds to his pride. A spouting black nationalist and hurt by his wife's abandonment, he is suffering from his loss and therefore makes mistakes in raising his daughter. Set in 1979, in New York, the music of the times and the racial climate gives this novel a sense of place.<br /><br />Melanie had dreams and those dreams eventually drove her to become more dissatisfied with a husband who was financially unstable and a dreamer himself. When she left, she left her daughter the only thing she had of value, a pressing comb that symbolized the generations of women before her who sought to beautify themselves before they stepped out into the world. Despite his bitterness and in spite of it, Teddo still clings to the work he feels he is called to do thereby exposing Angela to the seedier side of life in nightclubs and other venues. Angela sees and hears things she should not but a precocious child, she embraces the world outside of her Brooklyn neighborhood. A wise child, she also is not afraid to question her father's racist viewpoints and no matter how much she loves him she still wonders why did her mother leave her?. The irony of the situation is not lost on her when she acknowledges that though her dad is the magician; her mother has pulled the ultimate Houdini act.<br /><br />This is one that pulls at the heart strings. There is a scene where Angela recounts how though a great majority of the kids at school did not have a father in the home, everyone had a mother.

Gaston and the Making of a Black American Millionaire	Books	4	30	30	N	N	A True Rags to Riches American Story:First Black Millionaire	We learned in Our Kind of People that there have always been rich black folk; what is shameful is our lack of exposure or knowledge of such individuals. A.J. Gaston was one of the wealthiest black men and the first black millionaire. His story has been detailed by his niece, journalist/broadcaster Carol Jenkins, and her daughter, Elizabeth Gardner Hines in Black Titan, a revealing biography that is both compelling and forthright. Gaston, who was born poor in Alabama in 1892 and raised partially by his maternal grandparents in Demopolis, then went to live with his mother, Rosie, in Birmingham where she worked as a maid for a prominent white family.<br /><br />In Birmingham Gaston went to the Tuggle Institute for high school where he came in contact with Booker T. Washington who would remain one of his biggest influences. After he left high school, he supported himself with jobs such as delivering newspapers and factory work until he entered the army. It was overseas in France that he felt like a man but was brought back to reality when he returned to Jim Crow Alabama. Gaston went to work in the mines; dirty, grueling work but it was there where his entrepreneurial spirit was born. He sold his mother's catered lunches to the other miners and always being frugal, and then started a loan business. A businessman in the making, he then partnered with the Baptist church to start burial insurance and funeral businesses. Little by little these enterprises grew and when he partnered with A.L. Smith, who was already an established businessman, his ventures grew. Gaston & Smith proved to be very profitable professionally and personally when he married Smith's daughter Creola. They worked together and when she died, he married Minnie Gardner, a school teacher who came from a prominent family. They founded the Booker T. Washington Business School, which professionally trained many blacks which enabled them to work in Gaston's businesses and obtain gainful employment contributing to the burgeoning black middle class in Birmingham. Gaston also owned banks, insurance companies and manufacturing companies among his many companies.<br /><br />This book is as much about the southern black middle/upper classes in the making as it is about an American story of a man who rose from humble beginnings to become one of the richest men in American despite his race and the obstacles because of it. The south with its stringent mores and class issues was not relegated to whites only but was pervasive in the black community as well. This reviewer found one of the most intriguing incidents was the controlling nature of Gaston's first wife's mother who wanted to dictate who would be his second wife. There were white men in Birmingham who had the same rags to riches stories as Gaston, such as owners of the department stores and other prosperous businesses. The white establishment could not ignore the influence of Gaston and looked to him to \\"calm the natives\\" as the growing civil rights movement became more demanding. Gaston continually butt heads with Martin Luther King over what he considered King's unorthodox methods for gaining integration in Birmingham; the biggest issue was their disagreement over using children in the marching and boycotting of white businesses.  Nevertheless, Gaston was there to bail King and others out of jail when necessary.<br /><br />This book should be taught in every Business 101 class and should be mandatory reading for black high school students. It is shameful that outside of black business circles, so little is known about him and other blacks who has made such strides. Gaston was named millionaire of the century by Black Enterprise Magazine and should be noted as not only an accomplished black man but as a true icon of American history.<br /><br />Dera Williams<br /><br />APOOO BookClubng to the burgeoning black middle class in Birmingham.

Melanie Hitts is an up-and-coming interior decorator who has received some notoriety, has a handsome, successful fianc&eacute;e' and the kind of life a well educated woman from an established African American family is expected to have. But in front of friends and family in Washington D.C., she breaks off her upcoming nuptials at her engagement party and returns to New York on the pretense of furthering her career. Will is devastated, as is Melanie's family, not understanding why she did this. Will, despite his humiliation and the public rejection will not give up on the woman who has captured his heart. Melanie, meanwhile has snagged a plum assignment with an internationally known architectural firm run by John Carlson, a powerhouse in the world of architecture.<br />It was her sharp tongue, drive and the fact that she was not intimidated by him that drew Melanie to John. This beautiful, intelligent, witty young African American woman, eighteen years his junior intrigues him and fascinates in all the ways that should and should not and shakes up his white bread, privileged life. Melanie feels easy with John despite his being Caucasian and older; he complements her and feeds her artistic side in ways that Will, though as loving and attentive and perfect as he is, just does not. What is happening here? Is it possible to be in love with two men? Is it love that she feels for John? Ironically, Melanie has chastised her best friend; materialistic, self-centered Candace for indulging in affairs with married men. But this is not an affair, is it?<br />Both John and Melanie rationalize their need for each other as a friendship that is beneficial for the both of them that still allows them to love and appreciate their respective mates even more so. Now sure of herself, Melanie feels she is ready to be Will's wife. But will he understand if she keeps John in her life? John's wife, in many ways, a typical upstate suburban wife, has lived in her husband's shadow; repressing her need to express herself, and allowing him to make major decisions, the most recent, uprooting her from her safe haven in the country to move into New York City. Her need to nurture brings her in contact with a young teen-ager who lacks parental guidance and is prone to getting into trouble. Meanwhile high-maintenance Candace, falls in love with Will's best friend,  Griffin, a  struggling actor whose career is starting to take off and who is also performance poet. These secondary characters complement the leading characters, rounding out a plot that approaches issues of love in subjective and objective tones.<br /> At her appearance this past April in Oakland, Bryant-Woolridge talked about what she wanted to convey in this novel. How people come into our lives, challenge us, change us and the different kinds of love that are available to us and the need for all them in our lives. How those that love us should be willing to share us with others that we love. Admittedly in a perfect world, this would be ideal; there is a lot of love to be shared. But would your mate understand the need for you to have another person in your life that makes you happy? This book will no doubt spark debate about the age old debate regarding men and women being \\"friends\\". This reviewer is pleased to have given this book a try, sold by the author's eloquent sales pitch, not relegating it to just one more interracial story that has saturated the market. This is so much more as this book allows readers to look past the superficial things that trip us up in such a story. A big plus for this novel was the poetry of Teddy Bell that was sprinkled throughout the book. The handsome Bell, who accompanied Bryant-Woolridge at the reading and recited some of his poems, is possibly the inspiration and model for Griffin character who hasthe same last name. This book has been declared one for the top chick-lit reads of 2004 and is a worthwhile read.

Intra-racial prejudice and color consciousness has been a major part of her life since she was a child. When she was ten years old, Golden's mother told her she needed to avoid playing in the sun because she was dark enough; as it was she needed to marry a light-skinned man for the sake of her children. This one remark set off a lifetime of hurt and introspection where color issues were a constant presence.<br /><br />Golden's views were \\"colored\\" by and large by the geographical area in which she was born and raised, Washington D.C. This area is the seat of the black middle and upper classes, many who are descendants of mixed-race people who can trace their roots back to the Founding Fathers of the nation. They are known to have their set of cliques and alliances that in numerous circles have historically excluded darker blacks, keeping their inner circle light, bright and damn near white through careful manipulation of family ties. At a young age, Golden expected the curly-haired, light brown-skinned boys to reject her dark, short-haired self and that she could not infiltrate the popular crowd of lighter complexioned kids in high school. She deliberately did not apply to Howard University because she felt that although it was a black college, the lighter skinned students were more readily accepted. Ironically, it was at predominately white college, American University, that she came into her own as a member of the Black Student Union and under the banner of the new proclamation of \\"I'm Black and I'm Proud.\\" Golden relished in her dark skin and embraced an Afrocentric look. She eventually married a Nigerian, who reminded her of her very dark-skinned, estranged father and lived for many years in her husband's country. After a bitter divorce from her husband and return to the States, over the years she again became embroiled in the color complex issues that had plagued her young life. Thrown back into the dating scene, it became apparent to her that most black men wanted trophy wives---translated meaning lighter-skinned women.<br /><br />This reviewer grew weary of Golden's constant harping on her color issues, wanting her to step away and analyze why, after over forty years she is apparently holding on to her mother's mandate. Although she claims to have conquered her demons, acknowledging that light-skinned blacks are also victims, I was not convinced by this discourse. Almost every daily contact, almost every encounter, almost every snub, real or imagined is analyzed and attributed to her color. Why this accomplished woman, a highly regarded author of several books, an esteemed professor, and founder of the Hurston/Wright Writers Foundation continues to be defined by the color of her skin is astounding to me. Her recounting of how an older black male author judged her by her Afrocentric look is perhaps debatable, as is a remark made by her current husband's student who expressed surprise when meeting her, but her blatant dissatisfaction about a character from a classic novel borders, to my mind, on overkill. Golden continually wonders (on the border of obsession) why the character, Janie from Zora Neale Hurston's novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God is light-skinned even as she answers her own question.<br /><br />On one hand Golden's mother had issues with color, but her father came from a proud, dark-skinned family who seemed to be comfortable in their skin and their place in the world. It is unfortunate she did not inherit that legacy. I realize this is a memoir and therefore, this is her story, and through her eyes but this book, for me, was one continuous whine, decrying \\"woe is me, poor little dark-skinned girl\\" and could be deemed offensive to dark-skinned women who have learned to or always have loved themselves. However, I am well aware that this pervasive topic is the elephant in the middle of the room that we as a race are reluctant to confront and it is indeed a serious issue.<br /><br />For an unbiased, well documented reference on the subject of color consciousness and intra-racial prejudice in the black community, I recommend The Color Complex: The Politics of Skin Color Among African Americans by Kathy Russell written almost ten years ago.<br /><br />Dera Williams<br />APOOO BookClubphant in the middle of the room that we as a race are reluctant to confront and it is indeed a serious issue.

This is a term used that infers that something is done in secret. Only these secrets are being revealed because of the alarming rates of black women who are being infected with the HIV virus, most often by black men who sleep with both men and women. J.L. King in his recent release, On the Down Low: A Journey into the Lives of \\"Straight\\" Gay Men has elaborated on this lifestyle in his quest to bring it to light. King received death threats for coming out about this topic. His appearance on the Oprah Show fueled national dialogue which resulted in the premature release of the book which at this time is on the New York Times bestseller list.<br />OTDL explores the life of men who do not consider themselves homosexual or bi-sexual. Their attraction according to King is strictly sexual and no real feelings are involved. The majority of these men prefer and want to be in a loving relationship with a woman and a great majority are married with children. Their desire is to be with a man who is in every sense a man and would not be with an effeminate male. In exploring the reasons for these desires, King cites among others is the need to be dominated, to be held and the high esteem in which the penis is held.<br />This issue is not new in any community. Down low behavior has existed since the beginning of time and has always been a part of the black community. However, King addresses how the attitude in the black community and the black church about homosexuality contributes to down low behavior. There is also a chapter on how women can detect down low behavior and how important it is to use protection.<br />This was the Marcus Book store club selection for May. The overall consensus was while this book brought out a situation that many women had not considered and had them rethinking their relationships, most of us felt the author, in some cases generalized down low men. Even though he listed the five types of down low men, i.e.; the Professional brother, the I'm Married brother, and the Thug brother----even within these categories are subcultures of down low behavior. Furthermore, we felt Mr. King had contradictory information in regard to his own life. He seemed to be conflicted about his identity and not come to grasp with his continuing in this behavior. Mr. King's own marriage was destroyed when his wife found how about his secret and he wants his grown daughter to avoid going through such pain, yet the crux of the whole matter, cheating, lying, deceitful behavior, with impunity is not fully addressed. While this was a worthwhile effort, professional experts could have shed more light into this phenomenon making it a more rounded examination.<br />Dera Williams<br />Marcus Book Club- Oakland<br />APOOO BookClubauthor, in some cases generalized down low men.

The title is taken from the term used for the men who were torturers during the Duvalier regime in Haiti during the 1960s.<br />The Book of the Dead is the opening chapter of the book in present day, a story initially published in the New Yorker magazine. A young artist and her father, a respected citizen and business owner in the Haitian community of Brooklyn, New York, take a trip to Florida to deliver a sculpture when suddenly both the father and the art disappear. This sets in motion a series of interconnected stories by expatriate Haitians, who have been affected by this man, a former member of the Toutou army under the Papa Doc Duvalier's reign of torture and terror. The story is the catalyst for the subsequent stories that can stand alone as complete but have a thread that interweaves place, persons and time that culminates in a satisfying and intense ending.<br />Almost every character has been touched by the Dew Breaker. The young man in Night Talkers who returns to his native village in the Haitian countryside is certain his landlord in Brooklyn is the man who killed his father before he was born; the English as a Second Language student in The Funeral Singer whose painter husband was killed for painting an unflattering picture of the dictator; the young boy in Haiti who never knew his father in Monkey Tails and the retiring bridal seamstress who believes the man who abused her thirty years prior is now her neighbor in The Bridal Seamstress. The ending story with the same title as the book is a sobering, moving tale that renders one drained emotionally without judgment of the antagonist.<br />This reviewer has enjoyed and respected some of Danticat's past writings but this offering has earned her at the top of the list as one of my favorite writers. The language flows like waves over a blue ocean, brilliant color splayed over lines that dance off of the page.

Condi: The Condoleezza Rice Story by biographer Antonia Felix paints a picture of a life divine. This is the story of how a little black girl from the segregated south rose to prominence to become one of the most powerful women in political history. A woman whose impact may affect America forever. Hers however is not a story of a poor little girl scuffling from the ravages of poverty to a top level Presidential appointment. Not a rags to riches story here. No, Rice was raised in the comfort of the educated middle class, a privileged daughter of the south, the quintessential BAP, (Black American Princess).<br />Born to a third generation college-educated family in Birmingham, Alabama, Rice knew well the family history of her paternal grandfather's journey from sharecropper to college graduate and she knew the legacy she inherited was not to be taken lightly. Both the Rices and The Rays (maternal line) were proud, educated folk. Her mother, Angelena Ray Rice, was an accomplished musician and school teacher when she met John Rice, a young Presbyterian minister. By the time Rice was three years old she was learning French and the piano. Though she was in the midst of the most heated time of the civil rights movement-- her hometown was known as Bombingham--, the coping methods of the black middle class was one that shielded their children from the insanity and horrors of Jim Crow. Rice's parents' response to her concerns about segregated facilities was that it was not her problem. When the amusement park opened one day of the year for blacks, they did not patronize it. Summers were spent at college campuses where her parents took graduate courses, one being the University of Denver. They eventually moved there when John took a position as professor and administrator. Rice excelled in music and ice skating though she was informed that she did not have the aptitude for college. Of course her parents dismissed the notion and Rice proved them wrong by excelling in her studies at private schools.<br />After entering the University of Denver at age fifteen, where she challenged a professor on the intelligence of blacks, Rice realized that while she was a good pianist, she was not great and therefore shifted her interests elsewhere. She took a class in Russian Studies and there she found her passion. She went on for advanced degrees and eventually ended up at Stanford University as a professor and then a provost. It was there she came to the attention of President George Bush. But it is under the present President George W. Bush's regime that she has flourished and received world wide attention as the National Security Advisor.<br />The book, in tedious detail, chronicles Rice's academic and political career, however, nothing was really revealed that could have been culled from articles and other media outlets. This reviewer anticipated reading this book to get a real picture of the Condoleezza Rice that the public is not privy to and have my knowledge expanded about this hard-to-read woman. I wanted to get into the head of this woman with the plastered smile and perfect demeanor. I wanted to know the real woman.

I had heard of The East Bay Dragons, founded in Oakland and of course, everyone knew the Hell's Angels. Both were synonymous with danger and bad news in my sheltered existence. Their rough manner and their reputation of being bad asses was reason to avoid them. So, it was with great surprise while reading Soul on Bikes: The East Bay Dragons MC and the Black Biker Set, Marcus Book Store's April book club Selection, to find out that the East Bay Dragons is an integral part of Oakland history.<br />Tobie Gene Levingston and his family were a part of the northern migration to the East Bay from the southern states in the 1950s; his family being from rural Louisiana. Enticed by the burgeoning factories and other labor jobs and longing to escape the drudgery and endless, vicious cycle of sharecropping that so many black families had succumbed to as a legacy of slavery, California offered new beginnings towards a brighter future. Levingston, then in his early twenties began working in an iron foundry. The work was dirty and back breaking but it enabled him to contribute to his family finances and indulge in some luxuries; one of those being cars. He formed a car club but his group ran into some trouble with the local police and as a result disbanded. Not long after that, Levingston became interested in motorcycles and formed The East Bay Dragons, a black motorcycle club that is active to this day.<br />Because of the problems he had with the car club, Levingston was determined to keep the MC on the straight and narrow. But as this was a group of young black men, just the sight of them on their bikes, raised fear and ire to other residents and law enforcement agencies. There was rivalry with other MCs, white as well as black. There was the political climate of Oakland with racism and later the Black Panther movement. And there were the drugs. Oakland was rampant with drug trade and all the vices that went along with it did not escape some members of the East Bay Dragons. Though Levingston was the heart and moral pulse of the group, he could not control actions of every member. As a result, there were some violent clashes with the police and other MCs.<br />This book was a historical walk though Oakland and surrounding cities. Streets and locales that are familiar to this Oakland raised reviewer were prevalent all through the manuscript. Blues and prostitution on Seventh Street, East and West Oakland neighborhood haunts, and the evolution of blacks coming of age in a city that until the mid-60s was run by whites. Myths about the East Bay Dragons were debunked; these are fellows with families, jobs, with kids in college, who pay taxes and are home and business owners. Such movies as the Biker Boys with Lawrence Fishburn have brought to light that men and women from all walks of life are in the biker community.  I was surprised to learn that Levingston and Sonny Barger of the Hell's Angels were good friends with a history that goes way back. They have much respect for each other (Barger writes the foreword to the book) and the animosity between the two MCs were minimal. The Marcus Bookstore Book Club had our book club discussion and Mr. Levingston along with other members of the East Bay Dragons and the Oakland Invaders, another MC club were invited. It was a sight to behold as they roared down Martin Luther King Boulevard and parked their beautiful bikes along the street outside of the bookstore.

Books	4	1	1	N	N	Not With My Daughter	As a Viet Nam vet, Marin Taylor has seen the horrors of war; mothers and babies who died at the hands of U.S. soldiers, the dog-eat-dog life of the jungle and witnessing his comrades' death at the hand of the Viet Kong. Grace Edwards, in The Viaduct, continues with yet another suspenseful tale set in her native Harlem. Marin still has flashbacks and nightmares from the past.  But nothing prepares him for the unbelievable horror of his newborn daughter's kidnapping from the hospital less than twenty-four hours after her birth. With his wife, Margaret, now in a catatonic state because of the abduction, he feels like he is facing the war all over again.<br />In just a few days Marin's life has changed. One minute he had a job and a future with the woman he loves. Told that he is laid off, he stops at his favorite watering hole to contemplate how he is going to tell his eight month pregnant wife that he is now unemployed. On his way home with his severance pay in his pocket, his mind preoccupied, he is accosted by two street thugs, who rob him. But not before there is a struggle and Marin, in an attempt to save himself, throws one of them over the viaduct. But this is Harlem, 1970s and the police believe because this incident involves black men, it must be a drug deal gone bad.<br />When Margaret goes to the hospital to give birth a few days later, the last thing the couple expects is that they will go home without a baby. But that harsh fact becomes a reality when Conroy, a street thug, carries out the kidnapping as payback for his brother's death. Removed from reality, Conroy lives in a fantasy world where he imagines himself a big time hustler. In reality, his dead brother, Tito, was the mastermind of their crime sprees; now he owes the local loan shark for the funeral and he has a strong contempt for nine-to five employment.<br />The viaduct where the robbery occurred becomes a symbol for crime, tragedy and eventually triumph as Marin attempts to unravel the misfortune that has claimed his life. This was no big time mystery nor was there a great deal of suspense. Additionally, Conroy was so dimwitted at times he came across as a caricature and some of the characters, though colorful were somewhat one-dimensional.  However, Edwards's strength is her great writing skills and the ability to give the reader a sense of place and time. Her portrayal of underground Harlem as an entity to itself, set apart from the rest of New York, was nicely done. As a first time reader of this author, this reviewer is impressed enough to seek out the rest of her titles which are also set in Harlem.

However, Edwards's strength is her great writing skills and the ability to give the reader a sense of place and time. Her portrayal of underground Harlem as an entity to itself, set apart from the rest of New York, was nicely done. As a first time reader of this author, this reviewer is impressed enough to seek out the rest of her titles which are also set in Harlem.

Haizlip told of her search to find her mother's family, a family that seemed to disappear when they crossed the color line and became white. Through genealogy records, hundreds of hours searching in library and archives and meticulous research, Haizlip finally located her mother's sister. In this sequel, Finding Grace, we learn more about the aftermath of the meeting of the two sisters, Margaret and Grace. Grace, who was a young teenager at the time of separation, along with other siblings, entered the white world while Margaret was left behind with a cousin to be raised black. Haizlip tells how finding Grace changed her family's lives and found dozens of new relatives---- white people who knew nothing of their black heritage. These new family members embraced Margaret, her children and grandchildren.<br />Haizlip gives us vignettes of some well-known and not-so-known people who have African blood but who live or have lived as Caucasians. She cites the recent revelation of Carol Channing that her father was black, a secret she kept since she has been in college. Several mixed-race families are also cited. Hundreds of letters poured into Haizlip and she publishes many from people who have found out they, too, have black blood. Still others knew but chose to pass for white because to proclaim their blackness would have caused them hardship. Still, there were others such as the late literary critic, Anatole Broyard, who knew he was a person of color, but kept his secret. Some people did not so much as pass as just did not proclaim their blackness. Story after story reveals what many Americans do not want to face, that many white people have black blood running through their veins who passed into the white world successfully erasing any traces of blackness. But did they? How does the infamous one-drop rule affect them?<br />While this book was enlightening in the sense of people coming together and revealing that as much as there are differences in ethnicities, we are actually becoming more multicultural and some even believe that race is  becoming inconsequential. This reviewer's disappointment in the book was in the fact that we never got to hear from Grace, who while she embraced her sister and family, staunchly refused to talk about the circumstances that caused her and her siblings to pass nor would she discuss race. This of course, cannot be held against her; for almost eighty years she lived as white. She and Margaret had several years together before her death.<br />Haizlip spoke to a standing room only crowd in Oakland at Marcus Books. In the audience was her sister, Jewel Taylor Gibbs, a professor at U.C. Berkeley, who helped Haizlip with research and support. This book is a fitting sequel to the first book and a credible addition to mixed-race studies.<br />Dera Williams<br />APOOO BookClubinfamous one-drop rule affect them?<br />While this book was enlightening in the sense of people coming together and revealing that as much as there are differences in ethnicities, we are actually becoming more multicultural and some even believe that race is  becoming inconsequential.

He has missed important events, like plays and other school events, he even missed one of his daughter's college graduation. Ray grew up struggling so when he had his own family, he vowed to be a good provider. His daughters, Tina, Ashli and Samantha, though they have most of what they desire, have become accustomed to their father's frequent absences. When Ray met Glenda in high school, they became an instant couple. After she became pregnant, they struggled for awhile but gradually their circumstances changed for the better. The story spans a period of about thirty years from Ray's days as a high school student to the time as an adult with grown children.<br />One of the sub-plots included the growing pains of the three daughters as they navigated through different stages of their lives; school, romances, and careers. Another storyline involved the interracial romance of Ray's mother-in-law after being a widow for many years. When his youngest daughter becomes ill, Ray's deficiently as an attentive husband and father becomes a stark reality. But is it too late to change this workaholic?<br />Though the author does a fair job with characterization, the writing seems to lack a sense of depth. Moore wrote this as a screenplay and I can see how this could work effectively in that format. I feel this author has potential and would read his next offering.<br />Dera Williams<br />APOOO BookClub	2004-03-30

Liberty, Queen Ester, Chess and Helene are the key players in a quagmire of events. Reynolds takes us through the lives and loves of these people. Helene at twenty-six years comes back from Chicago to Helena, Arkansas to bury her aunt and find out why her mother, Queen Ester gave her up as a baby. She was raised by Aunt Annie b and Uncle Ed but they never supplied the answers to her questions.<br />We are privy to the idiosyncrasies of Liberty who believes a family is comprised of three. When her husband leaves after a fight one day, leaving her with some money and their daughter Queen Ester, she feels incomplete. She is forever trying to find that third person to make the circle complete. Enter Chess, a young man, who saw his father killed by hateful white folks over a jar of peaches. Having survived a flood, he finds himself in Liberty's restaurant. She tries to make him a son. He does not want to be in that family but every time he leaves, Liberty goes out and finds him. He eventually marries Halle and their life is full of strife and violence. Chess has his mistress, Morning, move in to help raise his children after Halle dies. There are other characters on the fringe who become integral elements in the story. For  example, there is all-seeing Other, who does not speak.<br />I eagerly awaited the release of this book. Reading novels with settings in the south is a passion of mine; that this story was set in Arkansas, my birth state, made it more anticipated. But this was a novel that had to grow on me. Scenes were extended and at times drawn out. I labored over several passages that had to be re-read several times, reminiscent of the convoluted writing of Morrison and Walker. However, I cannot overlook the superb writing skills with its flowering language and superfluous metaphors.  It was after discussing this book with my daughter that I was able to delve further into the symbolism and the license the author took with literary devices---- so much so that one could get lost. This was indeed a family drama with secrets; most are revealed satisfactorily but I admit I was left scratching my head by the bizarre ending. Nevertheless, I continue to seek and enjoy writers who step outside of the box and challenge readers.

All Rose ever wanted was to have a child but this dream seemed to elude her with one miscarriage after another. Robert did not understand why Rose was not satisfied with the life they have made with just the two of them. Against her doctor's wishes, she got pregnant again with disastrous results.<br />Robert, a college professor, at first, will not let his baby daughter, Rosetta Love, out of his sight but grows to detest the sight of her and leaves her with his in-laws when the baby turns one-year-old. Though he lives within walking distance of her, Seta, as she is now called, is not welcome at her father's house. He brushes her off and lets her know he wants nothing to do with her. Hurt and angry, Seta becomes a bitter child, who withdraws into herself. Seeking to belong, she often participates in destructive behavior which includes drinking and fighting. One thing she does excel at is basketball and that seems to give her self-confidence. Her grandmother, Rose's mother, Barbara, knows that her granddaughter feels a need to belong as she remembers how much she wanted for Rose and herself. She constantly relives her past and how her dreams did not come to fruition.<br />This reviewer felt that some of the motivations of characters, especially Robert, were unclear. We were often told how the characters felt rather than shown. For example, we were not privy to the reasons for Seta's decision to change, just told she had in fact changed her behavior. This book had more of a juvenile feel in the presentation and would be a nice coming-of-age story for teens and young adults. Additionally, it was an added bonus to reminiscence with popular songs of the 70s era. The writing was tight and I look forward to reading more of the author's work.<br />Dera Williams<br />APOOO BookClub	2004-03-30

The Love You Save May Be Your Own	Cherilyn Michael makes her fiction debut with her novel, Counting Raindrops Through a Stained Glass Window. Vanella Morris has it going on. She is on the way up the corporate ladder with a job that is coveted by a cunning co-worker and is financially secure. She also has a loving, attentive boyfriend who wants to marry her. Now, her family is another matter; they are a dysfunctional bunch prone to high drama. Her father is either borderline manic depressive or bipolar, her mother and brother endure his mistreatment, and her sister is a doormat for men. Although they are in St. Louis and Vanella is in Cleveland, Ohio, it is hard for her to remain unscathed by her family problems.<br />Vanella's immediate concern is ducking the proposal from Alton she knows is coming. Because of her parents' unhappy marriage, she has this theory; she calls it the O Theory which means marriage is the death of a great relationship. So when the question finally does come, she hems and haws until Alton callsl it quits. Though she is devastated, Vanella refuses to get married, instead she returns to St. Louis and take care of the latest family crisis. It is there that Vanella makes discoveries about her family history and comes to grips with some serious issues she needs to face in her own life.<br />This reviewer was looking for story that would veer from the norm of Sister has man, loses man, has family drama and gets man again syndrome. This reviewer enjoys a story that is well-crafted, entertaining and well written with characters that grab and engage the reader while presening a storyline that is plausible. There were colorful characters and realistic dialogue, especially the conversations with Vanella's  girlfriends that were oh so familiar waxing philosophically about the ways of men folk. However, there was something amiss with the believability of at least two of the plots that made me question if there was a bit of satirical view from the author. For instance, the dynamics of the relationship between Vanella and Synda, her so-called best friend did not ring true with me nor did the final developments with the family drama. Additionally, Vanella was one-dimensional and her O Theory became a tired mantra. For all of her I am Woman, hear me roar persona and the self-proclaimed family savior, she was stubborn and obsessed with superficial issues. In her favor, Vanella did show a measure of growth and this is what we want from our characters. Miss Michaels displays a talent for crafting entertaining stories that have surprising twists and turns. She is a force to be reckoned with in the sea of contemporary writers and I look forward to reading her next book.<br />Dera R.

As always, readers can expect a supporting cast of a diverse group of detectives from all walks and cultures of the greater Los Angeles area on duty, getting the job done and putting their own twist on the murder case involved. When Vicki Park, a Korean-American woman is found dead behind a Laundromat it becomes symbolic of the dirty laundry that is thrown around throughout the novel. The murder is immediately counted as a celebrity murder as Vicki is an assistant to the Latino candidate for mayor, Mike Santos, a charismatic guy, who has some dirty laundry of his own. This is a year after the Rodney King riots in 1992 and relationships between Koreans and the Black and Latino residents of the neighborhoods where they have businesses are tenuous, to say the least. They also feel they have not been supported by the police department and the city, in general.<br />Charlotte is at the best place in her life as she approaches her fortieth birthday-in fact she has never been better. After the devastating, violent deaths of her husband and baby daughter fourteen years prior, she has finally found happiness with a great man, Aubrey and has made peace with her manipulative mother, who is a snob. In fact, Charlotte calls the family home where her upper-class African American family congregates, the Nut House. As a detective in the highly regarded Homicide and Robbery division, she has gone through more than her share of drama in the department. She comes into the Park murder after a particularly rough year when she brought accusations against her former superior while she was required to appear before a police commission for questionable conduct while on duty.<br />It is known nationally that the Los Angeles Police Department has their share of problems with countless cases of victims' abuse and corruption amongst their personnel. Woods does an effective job of demonstrating the nuances of a city under a microscope without over dramatizing the details or pointing fingers at any one issue or group. Additionally, this author does an excellent job, as in her previous novels, of giving readers a view of Los Angeles (also her home) history interwoven throughout the narrative.  When Woods was here in Oakland for her book signing, she said she wanted to weave a multicultural tale that would depict the diversity of the city. In doing so she also manages to create realistic three-dimensional African American characters from different walks of life. Her characters, including the protagonist, are flawed and Woods delves deep into the psyche of these people as if they are real people. The first fifty or so pages moved a little slowly but picked up momentum and made for an evenly-paced, satisfying read.

Together, they strengthen their ties through tears of sadness, loss, career woes, and man trouble and celebrate their joys as well. They call themselves Las Sucias, the Dirty Girls in solidarity with their Latin background. These chicas are not to be dismissed as the everyday Salsa dancing, loud color wearing Latinas we are exposed to in the media.  They are from different economic backgrounds, parts of the country, and were raised with different values and even religions. This book, The Dirty Girls Social Club was all the buzz long before its release, the author, Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez being touted as the Latina equivalent of Terry McMillan. Indeed, the sucias do have a special sister-girl thing going.<br />Are they loud and outspoken? You bet. Lauren Fernandez, a columnist for the Boston Gazette, is opinionated and confrontational as she endures the ignorance of her Ivy League colleagues and the humiliations of her cheating fianc&eacute;e. With a Cuban father who is still waiting for Castro to die so he can go back to his beloved country and an Irish trailer trash mother from New Orleans, she eagerly takes on La Raza for fear of being found to be a fake. Takes from her column, Mi Vida, are a prelude to each chapter.<br />Are they sassy? You bet. Usnavys, pronounced Oooh-na-vees, not US Navys, which is what her Puerto Rican mother named her in honor of a ship. She grew up poor in the Boston projects, abandoned by her black Dominican father. She is a proud full-figured woman who uses her looks, achievements and credit cards to ward off her fears of being poor again. Which is why she cannot let herself love Juan. Yes, she does love him but you see he is poor, though highly educated and in love with Usnavys.<br />Rebecca Baca, from Albuquerque, dismisses the label of Mexican or Indian. You see her long established family of ranchers and business owners have occupied New Mexico for generations and boast of pure Spanish blood. Republican and conservative to a fault, she married a blond man who is chronically depressed and disappointed that she is not a \\"real Latina\\". She finds herself attracted to Andre, a Brit of Nigerian descent, who is also the financier of her Latina magazine, Ella.<br />Sara, a Jewish Cuban from Miami, is a white blonde Latina whose looks defy what a Latina should look like. She has it all. The rich, handsome husband, Roberto and the twin five-year old boys and a home in a ritzy part of Boston. She is known as the clumsy one but only her best friend and maid know that she is a victim of spousal abuse.<br />Elizabeth, a former model and now talk show hostess, is as her boss tells her an equal opportunity poster model. She is black with a Hispanic name and background and talks white. Born in Columbia, she and her mother have never let their color be an obstacle-it turns out race is the least of her barriers. A born-again Christian, she is hiding deep secrets that could possibly destroy her career in conservative Boston.<br />And Amber, who grew up Valley Girl in southern California, oblivious of her Mexican American heritage until she gets to college. It is there she discovers the Latin culture and her Mexican heritage in particular. She proudly claims her Aztec and Mayan backgrounds and joins the indigenous Mexica movement. She has been in the Rock en Espanol business for ten years, singing underground and producing her own records with her lover/husband, Gato, a native Mexican, with insecurities about her budding career. She changes her name to Cuicatl after an naming ceremony and then success becomes a reality. Is it all too much?<br />Told in the first person point of view of each of the six sucias, readers are treated to a front row view of the day in the lives of educated, middle/high class young women of Hispanic background.  Some readers may think the ending is a little too pat and some naysayers willsay it is unrealistic. But it is possible. Yes, it is and this novel opens up the door for more possibilities in telling Latina stories.

This book explores the social issues of racism, the ravages of war veterans, and police brutality as well as the dynamics in relationships of men and women and most especially mother and daughters.<br />Mothers often raise their daughters with a set of \\"rules\\" to follow, expecting them to accept and embrace those rules without ever fully explaining the whys of such. Each generation of women hope and pray that by giving these rules their girl child will have an easier time with navigating the high seas of love, life and economic stability.<br />The book opens with Miriam Rivers sitting at the bedside of her daughter, Aya, in a dank hospital room in New York. Aya, a nineteen year old college student has been shot by a policeman while jogging, apparently the victim of mistaken identity. Miriam has always tried to do right by her daughter. She saw that Aya was well cared but withheld the affection and attention her daughter craved. She never talked to Aya about the father she never knew or why they were all alone in the world. Miriam was raised by parents who raised her to stand apart from her community and schoolmates, reminding her of the privileges she had and the legacy she was to carry. Smothered by her mother's rules by which to live, Miriam rushes into the arms of Bird at age sixteen. At the young age of nineteen Bird is a Vietnamese veteran. But it is the 1960s and he is besieged by racism in finding suitable employment and the constant harassment of policemen. Bird finds solace in Miriam's love but his anger is so overwhelming in the face of the trials and tribulations he encounters daily, he slowly pushes her away. Tragedy leaves Miriam alone with baby Aya to raise by herself.<br />Written with conviction and candor, this novel is a testament to those men who have strived to love and protect their families while fighting racial and economic oppression, to those women who have loved men to the point of not loving themselves enough, to the mothers who have raised children to only have them taken away in a moment of violence, to the mothers who have dispensed \\"rules\\" to their daughters because it was the right thing to do and for those daughters who have  felt smothered and tempted to dispute those rules. bandele deftly weaves in and out of time spans with ease, her use of metaphors and similes paint vivid pictures.

Does this sound like Fantasyland? Well, it was the real life of Susan Fales-Hill as she reminisces in the memoir of her mother and her own life in Always Wear Joy. Susan's mother, the late Josephine Premice, singer, actress and dancer, probably most known for her tenure on Broadway in Bubbling Brown Sugar. Josephine was born in New York, daughter of Haitian immigrants who descended from the landowner Free People of Color when Haiti was Santo Domingo. Susan's father is Timothy Fales, a blue-blood family of generations of wealth and prestige.<br />Susan was a product of a bi-racial marriage and had some angst surrounding that issue, but the tragic mulatto, she was not. Her private schooling and world travels provided an atmosphere in a global arena where she and her family felt as if they were citizens of the world. At the Lycee France school in New York were children of families from the Middle East, Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Both her parents were multilingual and she and her older brother, Enrico, also became fluent in other languages. She was especially close to her mother who lavished attention on her only daughter. Her parents had what appeared an idyllic marriage despite Josephine's frustration with sparse roles and Timothy's indulgent wanderlust that kept him carousing the high seas with long periods away from the family.<br />Regular guests at their home included Diahann Carroll, Eartha Kitt, Richard Burton, and Roscoe Lee Brown, her godfather. It was nothing for Josephine to cook in full make-up and designer clothes.  But as some fairy tales do, this one was bound to end. As Susan became an adult, she was faced with young love and all the trials and tribulations of heartbreak, flunking out of her first year at Harvard and watching her castle begin to crumble. But she was the daughter of Josephine, the grand dame of divas and therefore persevered. Nepotism may have gained her entrance to the doors of Hollywood studios, but it was exceptional talent and a strong work ethic that kept her there for several years writing scripts for The Cosby Show, A Different World and other shows eventually becoming an executive producer and creator. Like other women though who were successful in their careers, she wondered if she would ever find her prince.<br />Fales-Hill wrote this book to honor the Black Divas such as her mother and her best friend, Diahann Carroll. These were the women who lived through the institutional racism of Hollywood and the civil rights movement, yet held to their strong values, holding their heads up, refusing to take roles they considered as demeaning. She cites Lena  Horne, Eartha Kitt, Cicely Tyson, Diana Sands and others who wore their armor of pride and strong will in public, though they suffered from being told they were too dark, too ethnic and just not good enough. Her mother refused to let the public see her pain even as her personal life and health failed her, always wearing joy. Fales-Hill has written a worthy tribute to her mother, a book to remember and savor.<br />Dera Williams<br />APOOO BookClubking out of her first year at Harvard and watching her castle begin to crumble.

Like other women though who were successful in their careers, she wondered if she would ever find her prince.<br />Fales-Hill wrote this book to honor the Black Divas such as her mother and her best friend, Diahann Carroll. These were the women who lived through the institutional racism of Hollywood and the civil rights movement, yet held to their strong values, holding their heads up, refusing to take roles they considered as demeaning. She cites Lena  Horne, Eartha Kitt, Cicely Tyson, Diana Sands and others who wore their armor of pride and strong will in public, though they suffered from being told they were too dark, too ethnic and just not good enough. Her mother refused to let the public see her pain even as her personal life and health failed her, always wearing joy. Fales-Hill has written a worthy tribute to her mother, a book to remember and savor.<br />Dera Williams<BR>APOOO BookClub	2003-09-29

Rochelle Alers continues her tradition of great storytelling with her venture into mainstream fiction in her offering, Secrets Never Told. Known for writing romance, her Hideaway series being the most prominent, she offers her readers a delightful novel.<br />In 1945 Salvation, Georgia, Randolph Johnson is a self-made wealthy young man,  respected and powerful in his community. Yet he holds malice towards the \\"talented tenth\\" population of the town, most especially Edward Graham, who comes from generations of privilege and wealth. By hook and crook he manages to literally win the hand of Edward's daughter, Katherine, in marriage. He has won the prize and will now command the respect he is obsessed with having.<br />Fast forward to present day, Chevy Chase, Maryland where Randolph's daughter, Morgana Wells, receives a double blow when within minutes of being told by her beloved uncle Julian, that her mother, Katherine has suddenly died, she discovers that her husband of almost thirty years is having an affair. Devastated, she flees Maryland to go home to Salvation, to not only bury her mother, but perhaps also to lay her marriage to rest. The next few days, amidst making arrangements for the burial, she never lets on to her two adult children, Justin and Sandra, that she is considering leaving their father. Filled with bitterness she sends her husband back home telling him she needs time to settle her mother's affairs and to meditate on the fate of their marriage.<br />It is at the lake where Morgana goes for solitude that she encounters an attractive dread locked man, Erick, who is a photographer/artist in-residence in nearby Savannah. He wants to photograph and paint Morgana. A man who has his own baggage, he is just the breath of fresh air she needs to bring back the passion missing from her life. But it is in the attic of the mansion where she grew up that she finds a set of her mother's journals that will forever change her life. In these pages, Katherine recounts her young married life in Salvation and makes revelations that in a few days threaten everything that Morgana holds sacred.<br />Evenly paced, this novel explores issues that are commonplace in black literature; intra-racial prejudice, classicism in the black South and how mixed-blood, issues of self-worth and self-hate, sin and redemption are intrinsically intertwined with family tradition and long-kept secrets. Furthermore, Ms. Alers is able to give her characters a humanity that defies pointing fingers of blame for a disintegrating marriage, allowing internal examinations of both Morgana and Franklin. Readers are also treated to the imagery and flavor of the Low-Country area of Georgia, making this yet another fulfilling southern novel of which this reviewer has been consuming for the last few months.

Lynn Harris' fictional accounts of life in the black male Gay world. Now, readers can get the truth up close and personal in this moving, chilling memoir, What Becomes of the Brokenhearted by this New York Times best selling author. Harris' first book, Invisible Life is considered a classic. Not since James Baldwin has a writer dared to venture into the taboo territory of black male homosexuality.<br />Harris exposes his life for the world to see-- straight, no chaser. Raised in Little Rock, Arkansas, the oldest child and only boy, with three younger sisters, he recounts the physical abuse by his father that left him emotionally scarred well into his adulthood. He was constantly belittled, called a sissy, and beaten by this man, whom he only wanted to please. It was not until he was twelve years old that he escaped the torment when his parents divorced, and his father was no longer a part of his life. Harris desperately wanted to belong, but was always self-conscious about his small, slight body. He found he could get attention from the cool kids by acting out but when an incident almost caused his expulsion from school, he buckled down and became a model student. As the new South dawned in the 1970s, he decided he wanted to attend an integrated school and so began his exposure to other neighborhoods and meeting and becoming friends with wealthy whites. But plagued with self-esteem issues, he felt inferior to not only wealthy whites, but middle-class black kids, often envying their neighborhoods and two-parent families. As a result, he concocted an identity with a middle-class background in order to belong. Additionally he was constantly struggling with his sexuality, pursuing girls but having feelings about boys.<br />Harris gives a first hand account of the class issues among African Americans in the south and the social life on a college campus. Education, job status, money, and a Mercedes gave him entry to the Buppie world but was not enough to fill the void that was threatening his existence. In searching for satisfaction, he moved from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville to Dallas, to D.C., to Chicago to New York and Atlanta, always looking for something or somebody to which he could belong; someone to love and to be loved. He found solace in alcohol and struggled with depression that was compounded by his battle about his sexuality. Meanwhile, he had to confront the fact that many of his friends were dropping off like flies, succumbing to AIDS.  He recounts how there are many black men who are locked into a down-low situation-- in relationships with women, while cruising the gay bars on the weekend. A recent article published in the New York Times about this very topic validates that this in fact is a dilemma in the homophobic black community<br />This is an emotional book which took Harris seven years to write and one he needed to write as a catharsis. There is no revelation of child sexual abuse, just a boy who had feelings he could not explain nor understand. His journey to self-love and acceptance is inspiring. E. Lynn said at his reading, \\"Don't feel sorry for me because this has a happy ending.\\" Indeed, Harris has conquered his demons as he has returned to the place he most wanted to leave, Arkansas, as he embarks on a stint as a writer-in-residence at his alma mater, the University of Arkansas for the Fall '03 semester. His fans also finally get to find out what the \\"E\\" in his name means.

When their actions make it perfectly clear that they do not love her and do not care what happens to her? Regina Louise, in her moving, compelling memoir, Somebody's Someone, chronicles her life as a child searching for a place to belong. Though she grew tired, disenchanted and weary, she knew there had to be somebody, somewhere who wanted her.<br />Regina Louise Ollison is an eleven year-old girl, born to a woman who had Regina's sister, Doretha, at age thirteen and then her, five years later. She is given away to Big Mama, Johnnie Jean Thornhill, as a baby because her mother is unable or unwilling to care for her and her father's whereabouts are unknown. In this household, every kind of dysfunction exists, not the least is physical abuse of which Regina is a recipient. When she is beaten within an inch of her life by Lula, Regina runs away and calls Odetta, a woman she remembers as her father's mother.  Odetta comes to the rescue, and is eager to do right by her granddaughter but trouble always finds Regina and she runs back to Big Mama's house where she feels safe. Big Mama puts her on a bus to North Carolina with some vanilla wafers, a soda and twenty-five cents and tells her that someone may or may not meet her on the other end.<br />Regina is overjoyed to be reunited with her mother, Ruby, even if she has to share her with two younger brothers and Mr. Benny. Yet though she has her mother, she still yearns for the demonstrative signs of affection that never seem to materialize. The next thing Regina knows, she is on a plane to her dad in Richmond, California. Her father is supposed to be a songwriter and artist who spends long periods in Los Angles away from his wife and two younger daughters in the Bay Area. Again, Regina is unwanted and unloved and through a series of events, ends up in a wayward home for girls. The County continually attempts to place her in a succession of foster homes to no avail. Regina, who grows up on 70s television with a vision of being part of a Brady Bunch family, is still looking for someone to love her. She finds it in one of the workers at the home, Miss Claire, who shows her unconditional love.<br />This is such a compelling, heart wrenching story--- hard to read yet it begs to be. Descriptive and well-written, the sometimes illiterate, southern dialect might be a distraction for some readers. At times you want to wring Regina's neck, her behavior seemed to be the cause of many of her problems, yet it went so much deeper. The years of abuse, the abandonment by her parents (her father tells her he doesn't love her), and the lack of black role models all contribute to her problems. To see the confident Regina today, who is a successful hairstylist/businesswoman and writer, there is no evidence that she was once destined to fail. This story will grab you, shake you up and make you count your blessings for your childhood.  This is truly a testament to human survival and the strength of the human spirit.<br />Dera Williams<br />APOOO BookClubs to no avail.

Writing Alone and With Others is an update of The Writer as an Artist by Pat Schneider, founder of the Amherst Writers and Artists Press and workshop method in Amherst, Massachusetts.<br />This book is chock full of advice on the craft of writing for those who are struggling with discipline and is an excellent resource for those who are in writing/critique groups or those who want to start a writing group. Some of the areas covered are fear, discipline,  the development and growth of the craft, voice, and the approach and methodology of  group writing.  In a heading entitled Why Keep a Journal? it is stressed that one's life has significance and is part of history of the world. In Finding Your Own Voice, writers are encouraged to reclaim their \\"original voice\\", the one used as a child, in finding  the writing voice. There is a brilliant piece from Pat's own life where caught up in life's woes, she allows herself a reprieve from writing, only to find that in that suspended state her creativity erupts forth naturally of its own volition.  The exercises throughout the book are provocative and stimulating and work well individually or in group settings.<br />I had the pleasure of attending Pat's book launch and workshop for the book earlier this month in Berkeley where, at Pacific School of Religion, she holds an annual writing workshop. Upon my arrival home, I immediately began to devour this great resource and have been picking it up every day. This is the one writing book that should be purchased this year.<br />Dera Williams	2003-08-15

Curry has resurrected the magnificent, hard-hitting, journalistic stories that made the now defunct Emerge Magazine the premier feature news publication in the 1990s. In this 660 + page volume, we are graced with The Best of Emerge Magazine edited by Curry. It is a work of brilliance to combine these stories in one work to be read at the readers' convenience and pleasure. It is also a vital, historical document worthy of being filed with the Schomburg Institute.<br /><br />The exposes are prolific, provocative and well-written. Who can forget \\"Kemba's Nightmare,\\" the young college student who got caught in a drug dealer's web? She was sentenced to thirty years in jail, where she gave birth to her son and tore at the heartstrings of countless African Americans, especially middle-class parents, who were reminded \\"There but for the grace of God, that could be my child.\\"  Reported in three parts over several years, Kemba was pardoned by President Clinton just before he left the White House in 2000. Ralph Wiley's insightful essay in 1989 about black athletic superiority is now a classic as is Lee A. Daniels' stunning article, \\"Targeting Black Boys for Failure.\\" Jill Nelson's story \\"Amazing Grace\\" examines the plight of Deborah Lyons, wife of the dishonored president of the National Baptist Convention. Nelson expounds on the subservient role Sister Lyons and other women take in the wake of male religious leaders who continually humiliate and shame their loved ones.<br />\\"Driving While Black\\" and \\"Thinking While Black\\" are among other stimulating articles, as well as \\"Rape of a Spelman Coed\\" which made us look hard at the issue of acquaintance/date rape in the black community and our attitudes about it.  Profiles of Dick Gregory, Johnnie Cochran, Farrakhan, Betty Shabazz, Elizabeth Catlett and Tom Joyner captured the essence of who's who in diverse black America.  And did we not look forward to \\"Friend Fire\\", the witty column written by Lauren Adams Deleon, which looked at the stupid, crazy, bizarre, but true antics of our folk? There are a great many more great stories, but what remains with me to this day is the MasterCard moment of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, posed as a lawn jockey on the cover of one of the most controversial issues of the publication, and the accompanying article written by Curry himself. Priceless indeed.<br />This reviewer is of the mind that such controversial issues as the Thomas piece, among others, led to the Emerge's demise, which is contentious in itself. It seems everybody does not agree with putting our dirty laundry out for all the world to view. Loquacious, innovative and groundbreaking, this is the meat of journalistic reporting. I was disappointed when the magazine ceased publication and have not found another quite to my satisfaction to replace it.

He called his wife, Charlotte, Miss Ann and continually told the couple they looked like a Dairy Queen mistake; the chocolate and vanilla ice creams colliding. This is the bane of Kate Manning's novel, Whitegirl. At first impression after reading the jacket cover, one will immediately think of the O.J. Simpson/Nicole Simpson crime of the jealous black husband accused of killing his sexy, blonde, white wife or the famous play by Shakespeare, Othello. Charlotte Halsey is a fair-skinned, almost white-haired blonde who spent her early life on the beauty pageant circuit, raised by a mother who put a lot of stock in one's appearance and looks. Told in the first person voice of Charlotte Halsey Ribocheaux, the story opens with her in the hospital as she recovers from a devastating assault in her home. She has apparently been attacked with a knife and her husband, Milo is in jail for the crime, all the time insisting he did not do it, but in fact found her and tried to save her life.<br />Raised in a dysfunctional, religious family, Charlotte escapes her small Northern California home to go to college in Vermont where she meets Milo Robicheaux, a black skier, who was raised in Rugged Mountain, New Hampshire where his family are the only blacks in the town. \\"Blacks don't ski,\\" is Charlotte's first impression and then immediately chastises herself, after all she is not a racist. Charlotte is the girlfriend of Jack, Milo's ski teammate, who looks like her brother, pale and blonde. She and Milo dance together at a party, see each other on campus and go their separate ways. Fast forward seven years when they cross paths in New York where Charlotte is now a well-known fashion model and Milo, after achieving Olympic Gold status and having made millions in endorsements, is now a television sportscaster.<br />The courtship gets off to a rocky start but eventually they fall in love, but not without advice and concern from others. A black model tells Charlotte, \\"You know you are a phase for him.\\"  Her parents, although claiming that all men are created equal, caution her about her choice--- her mother is constantly hinting that she should be with Jack. Milo's parents, however, were the most contradicting. \\"Son, your mother is a beautiful black woman and so is your sister. \\" his father reminds him. True, but that is not what he saw in his snow white town in New Hampshire despite childhood summer visits to his parents' native New Orleans. Milo did not have a clue of how to relate to a black woman; they scorned him and called him a white boy. Neither was he seen as black by his white classmates or friends and associates. He was a white man that looked black. He was an All-American boy, an Oreo.<br />Milo's white soul persona therefore does not jive with some of the inconsistencies of the character, making him an enigma. After he becomes an acclaimed actor, he is suddenly concerned about his image and the fact that he is married to a white woman.  He is asked to serve on a board of a black organization and suddenly the dynamics are reversed when Charlotte is one of the few whites at the functions they attend. Things heat up when Charlotte puts her foot in her mouth, while being interviewed by the press about state of a black neighborhood. Milo immediately overreacts, and abandons her and their young daughter, Hallie, for five weeks. Constantly frustrated in her marriage, Charlotte turns to the bottle and abuses antidepressants while obsessing over her fading beauty.<br />Charlotte's sometimes whiney monologue at times was annoying and repetitive. As she reminisces, she asks herself repeatedly if her husband is capable of hurting her and considers two other possible suspects, including Jack, who has recently reinserted himself back into her life. Meanwhile, she cannot help agonize over the betrayal Milo had presented her just a few days before the attack. Because the author of this novel is white, (her picture strikingly resembles the character Charlotte) she is able to get into the head of how a white woman who has violated the great taboo feels and acts, which adds validity and texture to the story line. The book, for the most part, was well-written but was not without some stereotypical portrayals.

This is a story that demonstrates how secrets, lies, and dirty deeds from the past can all come to a head. Told in the first person voices of the lead characters, Nina Montgomery, a young woman and her old soul child, thirteen-year old Zoe, the story alternates between the two voices. Zoe is fed up with her mother's trifling ways. Going from one man to the next, selling herself to the highest bidder, Nina has disrupted her daughter's life, time after time and now she wants to do it again just when Zoe has found stability. But out of the blue, a phone call comes from Florida and Nina is ready to uproot their lives again.<br />This time it is not a man, but Nina's long estranged mother, who is now ill and wants to reconcile with her daughter. Tired of her volatile relationship with her live-in lover Trevor, Nina thinks this might be the chance to start over.  His lying and cheating ways and the resulting mental and physical abuse has gotten to be too much. But Nina has lived off of men for so long, will she be able to make the transition to independence? Not to mention the strained relationship with her mother, the feeling of not being loved by her, and the betrayal and turmoil that pushed Nina out of the house at age fourteen and into motherhood at fifteen. Her mother, Angela, has never seen Zoe, but Grandmother and granddaughter immediately bond. However, the relationship between Nina and Angela remains fragile, even in the wake of her mother's serious illness; there are just too many past hurts and secrets.<br />Quinn and Paris, who are both involved in the church, befriend Nina and Zoe. Quinn is a successful hairstylist/businesswoman and Paris is an attorney and a minister with her own set of problems. Paris's son, Josiah aged sixteen, and Zoe nurture a special friendship. When Nina slowly realizes a connection, a secret so perverse, so disgusting that can destroy all of their lives, her first reaction is to do what she does best, run again.<br />Nina is not always the most likeable character.  She is self-centered and materialistic and will never be voted for mother of the year. There is a lot of internal monologue with this character constantly beating herself up while glorying in the lifestyle of a woman who knows how to manipulate men for personal gain. The voice of Zoe is well developed and her character is a delight to read, not to mention the poetry she writes. As a matter of fact the characterizations of all the teenagers in the story are on point. The adults, in this reviewer's opinion, seemed a bit stilted, often spouting dialogue riddled with overused preachy messages. The writing while textured with some admirable descriptions could have benefited from better editing.

The time span from the 1930s to 1950s encompasses family drama, The Blues movement, the politics of segregation and race issues, along with the convoluted dynamics of color and identity that is indicative of the inhabitants in the state of Louisiana.<br />Phillip Fergerson, though a product of mixed blood, is identifiable Colored; he cannot pass the paper bag test. He considers it a coup to marry the beautiful, unattainable Martha Broussard, whose milky white skin and white features are a sense of pride and joy and by which she sets herself apart from common Negroes. She, like her late father, revels in their Creole heritage. Her family, once wealthy landowners in Estilette, a town near Baton Rouge, lost their fortune to pure unadulterated racism. They might have looked white, but they are not, a bone of contention for her. Martha is a piece of work as she tries to direct the lives of her husband, her three daughters and son as well as her brother, Johnny \\"Lightfoot\\" Broussard.<br />Lightfoot, as he is called in the Blues world, is a thorn in Martha's side. Immersed in the world of that \\"low-down, gut bucket music\\", as she calls it, he challenges her mores and values of color and class. Equally frustrating to her is Lightfoot's black skinned woman, Naomi; who is known to practice voodoo. But this is one thing she has no control over; Lightfoot, a guitar player, loves his Blues and his woman.  Martha also concentrates on manipulating her children; Velma, Rosa, Lala, and Bobby. Velma has issues because she has short, nappy hair, a pasty complexion and Negroid features whereas Lala is light and beautiful with long straight hair and gray eyes. Velma, like her mother, is color-struck and mean-spirited.<br />By Phillip being the superintendent of Colored schools, the Fergersons have a special status in town. Frustrated and lonely in his marriage, Phillip seeks solace in Alicia, a professor at Southern College in Baton Rouge. He also leaves the Catholic Church when the priest questions his integrity and becomes a Baptist. Martha is horrified to say the least. Phillip continually finds himself disillusioned and at odds with the white hierarchy of Estilette. His children are trying to find their way, making decisions that torment their parents. To Martha's distress, Lala takes her piano playing from the Catholic Church to the Baptist Church and then to the juke joints, creating an irreversible breach between mother and daughter. Velma's lack of self-esteem leads her into a world of vices, while Rosa wanders into an affair with a priest.<br />I wanted to embrace this novel as soon as my book club sisters brought this book back from BEA last year, immediately identifying it as my kind of read. I wish I had not waited so long. The historical context of the time period and place was illuminated with a renowned cast of Blues folks that passed through the juke joints, such as Leadbelly, Bessie Smith and B.B. King. Also, other issues concerning the past, including the budding civil rights movement and the no-nos of the South; interracial dating and \\"disrespect of white womanhood\\" were manifested. A family saga that spans twenty years with all the complexities it entails, I knew it would be worth reading. There were, however, some inconsistencies in some of the delivery. LeBlanc, a Louisiana native, is also a scriptwriter, and a few of the scenes read that way. Many times, sequences of events happened quickly and were resolved in one paragraph. We were told, rather than shown, of some events leading to a subplot of which there were many, while others were left hanging. Despite these shortcomings, this is storytelling at its best, the kind of material of which great Southern novels are made.

They became friends and marched together in civil rights marches in New England. Now forty-five years later, Ms. Steinau Lester, now a journalist/writer reunites with Congresswoman Holmes Norton in writing her biography in Fire In My Soul.<br />Congresswoman Holmes Norton's great grandfather, Richard John Holmes, escaped from Virginia into Washington D.C. to become a free man and elude his former owner. He eventually became one of the few black firemen in the nation's capital and persevered to become a sergeant in the department. He felt a black man was worthy of equal opportunity and it is no surprise she inherited some of her great grandfather's  fire for justice. With a legacy such as this, having descended from a strong, middle-class background, it is little wonder that she pursued a career in law that would one day put her in the limelight.<br />Already involved in civil rights activities, the Congresswoman, while a Yale Law School student, went to Mississippi  in June 1963 to join the voter registration drive as a SNCC member. Twenty-four hours later Medgar Evers was dead, victim of an assassination and Holmes Norton had to make quick decisions concerning other members who were being falsely arrested.  After law school, she obtained a clerkship with Judge A. Leon  Higginbotham, Jr., the first black district court judge, in Philadelphia. She then met her future husband, Edward Norton, also an attorney, a man who was secure enough to not be threatened by her status or activities.<br />Holmes Norton's status did indeed rise as she ventured further into her profession as an attorney, became more involved with civil and human rights, and eventually going into politics. Her life was not always smooth. Her daughter, Katherine, was born with Down's Syndrome; however, she resisted health specialists advice to institutionalize her when she got older. She was very devoted to her.<br />This reviewer had the opportunity of seeing the Congresswomen twice this year. She is as formidable a presence in person as she is in the media. Her stature commands respect and her sense of belief in pursuing and preserving the rights of human life comes across instantaneously. She is a cheerleader for the people of Washington D.C., who she represents with candor and is respected by them as she respects them. This was a well-written biography of a powerful woman.<br />Dera Williams<br />APOOO BookClubd to her.<br />This reviewer had the opportunity of seeing the Congresswomen twice this year.

The author's picture reminded of someone I knew who also grew up in Belize.<br />Sandra Crough felt the sting of rejection and pity because she had no mother. Her married mother conceived her with a man that was not her husband and then left her with his mother to raise the child. \\"Why she no want me?\\" is her constant question to her grandmother. She is a brown-skinned gyal, a combination of the blending of the Spanish, Indian and African blood of Cental America. British Honduras, renamed Belize, is the only English speaking country in Central America. Sandra was born in Catholic Spanish Honduras where her father works for an American firm. She is taken to Belize where her Anglican grandmother sends her to Catholic school. She sees her mother, who now has other children, periodically, and spends some holidays with her father. She never feels any familial bond with either of them; they are both cold to her.<br />Sandra completes school and is fortunate to escape a legacy of marrying young and gets the opportunity to go to London to study nursing where she meets students from other countries and fall in love with an English young man. She then comes to the conclusion that America is where she wants to go to pursue her dreams and here is where this novella abruptly ends. Crough paints the landscape of Central America with descriptive imagery and the innocent voice of a child growing into herself. I look forward to the sequel of this story.	2003-07-13

Drawing upon historical context along with interviews with an assortment of African American women, it appears she has favorably portrayed them in this text. Recent articles such as the Newsweek article about successful Black women's strides and challenges juxtaposed against the reported dismal picture of African American men's accomplishments give a short synopsis of the obstacles, fears and triumphs of having it all. This book digs further into the psyche of Black women, who Zora Neale Hurston has called \\" the mules of the world\\". But we have come a long way baby, as evidenced in the changing face of Aunt Jemima who has gone from an overweight, handkerchief wearing mammy to a perfectly coifed, smartly dressed intelligent woman that entertainment stylist B. Smith would be proud to honor.<br />Can Black women have it all? Over a five-year period Chambers spoke with such high profile women as Janet Hill, Starr Jones, and Donna Auguste along with others not as well known who struggle with the same doubts and concerns as their White counterparts but with the added burden of race. What is interesting is how each of these women define success. Some count having it all as having successful careers along with the financial rewards along with a satisfying marriage and children. Still others women measure their success by their careers strides only and do not feel the need to marry and/ or have children. But more times than not, they all find themselves straddling the line between the Black and White worlds. Some of these women are first generation college graduates from working-class backgrounds, others have parents who were the first to partake of the benefits of the civil rights movements, and still others come from affluent backgrounds of several generations.<br />Thelma Golden, former curator at the Whitney Museum and now a director at the Studio Museum in Harlem, talks about having a sense of entitlement, never allowing race to be a stumbling block. Robin Nelson-Rice, who has traveled and lived abroad in her career, talks of being worlds apart economically and education-wise from her family, and the author herself talks about constantly being asked for financial assistance by her extended family. Susan Fales-Hill, who is a legacy of affluence, regularly appears in Vogue and Vanity Fair society pages and cautions Black women to keep their options open when choosing a mate. Still another young woman who was raised by parents in the Black Power movement despairs of finding a Black man with which to grow old.<br />This was very well researched and written and like other exposes in the same vein including \\"Our Kind of People\\" by Lawrence Otis Graham, overdue. Chambers, who has been a staff editor at Newsweek and other publications, continually stresses that the women we see in these pages are not exceptions, but the norm, women we know and see everyday.  I don't know if this book is so much about women who want or have it all as about women who have come into their own and have learned to negotiate their lives on their own terms. I would recommend it if only to reassure us that, yes we can have it all.<br />Dera Williams<br />APOOO BookClubelma Golden, former curator at the Whitney Museum and now a director at the Studio Museum in Harlem, talks about having a sense of entitlement, never allowing race to be a stumbling block.

Midlife, in Brice's words at a recent book signing, can be defined not so much by age, as by the life experiences a woman has gained. For Brice, mid-life began for her in her late twenties when her mother became ill and died. At about the same time, she began to evaluate her relationships and aspirations.<br />In this anthology, women who are well known such as Alice Walker, Pearl Cleage, J. California Cooper and Nikki Giovanni and others not so well known, write about a period in their lives that define midlife in all of its joys and tribulations. Gloria Wade Gayles regales us with a tale of a middle-aged woman throwing out her inhibitions at a dance in \\"Who Says an Older Woman Shouldn't Dance\\".  It is a commentary on how society in general feels about women who just don't care what others think. Lucille Clifton's well-known poem \\"New Bones\\" is a delight and fitting here. Elaine Lee tells of preparing her mother-and herself for death in \\"Full Circling\\".  In \\"Homegirl Reunion\\", Joan Hopewell-Hartgens questions why her friends would throw a reunion for their childhood friends who are turning fifty that particular year. She almost backs out of the reunion but decides to go and basks in the seasoned womanhood they have attained. There are excerpts from \\"The Women of Brewster Place \\"by Gloria Naylor and \\"A Day Late and a Dollar Short\\" by Terry McMillan. And remembering that getting older oftentimes means getting better as far as sexuality is concerned , Opal Palmer Adisa adds sassiness with her poem \\"Gray Pussy Hair\\". Amazing!<br />This collection proves that as women grow older, they can grow with grace and wisdom despite the issues encountered. This is a delightful compilation that will make a great gift for any woman, young or old.<br />Dera Williams<br />APOOO BookClub	2003-05-18

In this slim volume called Quilting the Black-Eyed Pea, we get both genres. Some pieces have both; they start off as a poem and meander into essay form as in the self-titled offering, \\"Quilting the Black-Eyed Pea\\". What does H. Rap Brown have to do with NASA and Martians? Well, in this poem/essay, she ties it all together and somehow it all makes sense.<br />In \\"Twenty Reasons to Love Richards Williams, Giovanni pays tribute to Venus and Serena Williams' father; \\"He makes white folks crazy (PS and the black bourgeoisie, too)\\". \\"Don't Think\\" is but six powerful lines and \\"Blackberry Cobbler\\", now one of my favorite poems, is reminiscent of childhood and grandmothers. Tributes are paid to James Baldwin, Rosa Parks, and there is another Aretha poem. In these tributes, a ground work of black history is laid before she bestows the honoree with ultimate adulation.<br />As in Love Poems, her previous collection, Giovanni gives you words of wisdom, love, and conscientious discourse. This is a book that you will find yourself picking up again and again and wanting to share with others. This is poetry- Nikki style.<br />Dera Williams<br />APOOO BookClub	2003-04-20

She takes incidents from her life as an entertainer, daughter, sister, and mother to reveal the fears, trials and joys of life.<br />Each chapter is headed by a title that will grab and take hold of your senses and make you contemplate, such as &quot;Many a false step is made by standing still&quot;, &quot;If you can't be the tablecloth, don't be the dishrag&quot;, and &quot;The best way to predict your future is to create it&quot;.  She shares the heartaches of losing her sisters to illness and the fickle world of show business. She shares candidly the heartache of the end of her long-time marriage and the determination to move on, hopeful that the future promises a brighter future.<br />This is a little book with big ambitions, not unlike many of the feel-good, self-help books that are offered by many entertainers who want to share their triumphs over adversities. This book is forthright but does not have a preachy tone that can be a turn-off as some other similar books do.

Dakota Grand is a young man on the rise. Twenty-two years old, he left his home in Atlanta to make his mark in the Big Apple and is ready to take on New York, showing the world he has what it takes to write the big stories and maybe in the process write that Great American Novel--Hip-Hop style. He is also determined to redeem himself in his single mother's eyes who is disappointed because he left college to pursue his dream.<br />Dakota is a big fan of Arbor Day, a recently disbanded two-man rap duo. When he is awarded the assignment of his life, an interview with one of brothers in the group, Mirage, he sees it as his big break; this coup will set him apart. With this interview, he will be in the same league as the big boys who write the cover stories for Source and Vibe magazines. However, along with that honor, unfortunately sometimes comes an occupational hazard of incurring the wrath of the entertainers. It seems they can change their mind after the interview and that is exactly what happens. Threats are issued and what ensues becomes a stack of tumbling cards.<br />How does this happen when everything seems to be coming together? He has the magazine career of his life-he is the man of the hour with freelance assignments being offered to him at every turn, a publishing house wants to publish his novel, and he has a new woman in his life.  Carolina, a chocolate sister from Cuba that he meets on the subway, allows him to see the possibilities of allowing someone to get close to him.<br />Told in first person, this offering allows readers to become familiar with several facets of a writer's life, a world where a freelancer lives hand-to-mouth, where obtaining the next writing assignment or getting a big break determines if one has food to eat or can pay the rent. We see Dakota going through the writing process, the discipline, the disappointments, and the gradual awareness of his acknowledgement that there is much to be learned about the craft.  Jasper has a writing style that has influences of Baldwin and Ellison, surreal, precise and genuine.

How many of us remember the burning of homes and black businesses and the bombing of a church where four little girls were sitting in Sunday School? In Anthony Grooms' touching, poignant novel, Bombingham, you will travel back in time and be reminded, if you are old enough, and introduced if you were not, to that turbulent time of unrest in U.S. history. Bombingham became synonymous for Birmingham, Alabama because of the bombings of Negro homes and businesses was such common occurrences.<br />Fast forward to the Viet Nam War where Walter Burke finds himself with the dreaded task of writing to the parents of one of his fallen war comrades. How do you write a letter to the parents of a dead soldier? Haywood was a country boy from rural Alabama and was in awe of the fact that Walter was from Birmingham, the big city, where the civil rights struggle was prominent. Walter attempts to write this letter to make Haywood's parents understand why he was unable to discuss that dark, ominous period over several months that changed his life forever.<br />The story is told in first person from Walter as an eleven year-old boy from a solid middle class family in Birmingham. His father is a high school science teacher and mother a secretary for a wealthy black businessman. They were the kind of family we see on a funeral home fan; handsome father, pretty mother, young well-groomed boy and little sister with perfectly braided hair. They don't raise their voices, are nice people and a credit to the Negro race. But the pretty picture is shattered within a few months when a series of tragic events occur, events that mark the end of Walter's childhood innocence and existence.<br />He and his best friend, Lamar, a boy from the projects, are a pair of kids who ride their bicycles and have a paper route. Their dreams are to be astronauts; they cling to this hope though they realize that as Negroes, the chances are near impossible. Nevertheless they pursue their endeavors by collecting and dissecting specimens. Lamar is a daring kid and one day he talks Walter and his sister, Josie into trespassing in the Whites only park where they are caught and severely reprimanded by a White man. Meanwhile the civil rights movement has come to Birmingham full force and the children are pulled into it. Many of the Negro adults are fearful of the movement, some because of the fear of losing their government and teaching positions as well as domestic jobs, and many because they view the civil rights movement as something done by those \\"troublemakers\\". Walter's parents fall into both categories as many Negroes do, who feared for their lives standing up for basic human rights. Because many of the parents could not or would not join the marches and sit-ins, the children did so, embracing the charge with enthusiasm and fervor.<br />When Walter's mother becomes seriously ill, the family falls apart leaving in its wake alcoholism, abuse, and destroyed dreams that continued to haunt him as an adult. The notion that all blacks were for the movement is dispelled as many of them were in a resigned state of hopelessness and belief that is was the Negroes' lot to dare not hope for change. Poignant, compelling, moving, this story is however a testament to those brave souls, including the children, who sacrificed and stepped up to the plate for righteousness only to have their spirits and very lives snuffed out of them. This novel is a must read for those who have an interest in the civil rights movement.

In Love we saw Grace, the youngest daughter of Camille Broussard, go through her identity crises, sometimes racially and certainly gender wise. Now we have the matriarch Camilles story, who at age sixty-seven feels her life slipping away from her. All she wants to do is to be able to get ahead just a little before she dies.  Cleaning and cooking for the church was not the way she wanted to go out. Her specialty staples of meat pies and seafood gumbo are renowned and it is her desire to open a business and share with the world.<br />The Broussards are just one of many families that migrated from Louisiana to Los Angeles pre and post WWII and brought their strait-laced Creole culture, mores, history and superstitions. Camilles seven children are her heart and the bane of her existence. Marc, a card carrying member of the black bourgeoisie; Yvette, the sexually frustrated oldest daughter who is married to Juge, an older man in ill health; Grace, the lesbian in therapy, who has been in community college for seven years; Raymond, whose loss of his longshoremans job causes him to wallow in self-pity; Joseph, the Vietnam vet who is an alcoholic living on the streets and Anthony, who has inherited the cabinet making business from T-Papa Broussard, are just some of the colorful personalities. And then there is Nicolas, her nineteen-year old grandson who has just been released from prison and has brought shame to the family. But they all have the same idea, get Mama out of Watts. It is 1984 going into 1985, twenty years after the L.A. Riots. There are those who stayed and those who fled for greener pastures, including many of the Creole families that have lived there since the 30s. But Camille, a widow for nine years, hangs on to the good old days, before the Riots, when families where intact, everyone worked hard, went to Mass together and had big parties with lots of Creole food.<br />Camille tries a number of enterprises, sells her famous meat pies to church events and festivals, bottles her famous Creole hot sauce, packages pralines, and even concocts a apricot brandy sauce with her neighbor Pep. Then she hits on an idea to open a restaurant, Camilles Creole Kitchen, but she is not one to bother with details like licenses and zoning issues; she just knows her stuff is good. Her kids think she is taking on too much at her age and who would come to the middle of Watts to dine anyway?  Meanwhile the Broussards are struggling to understand the past while painting pretty pictures of family harmony to the public but not knowing how to reach out to poor, mentally disturbed Joseph and newly-released Nicolas. Camille feels it is her place to teach her family to love unconditionally and not give up on their dreams.<br />There are recipes sprinkled through the books such as Miss Camilles Meat Pies and her grandmothers dark pralines. Camille is happy when cooking and the food is a metaphor for the themes of her life. Ms. Rawles beautifully weaves symbolic language corresponding with the seasons of nature as well as the seasons of Camilles life. She also details how the issue of class and color are played out in Creole families struggling to either assimilate or not assimilate into mainstream African American life.

No, this is not a Toni Morrison novel but Olympia Vernon in her debut offering, Eden, will no doubt be compared to the Queen Mother of literature. This novel will more than likely be embraced by the literary community making this a crossover fiction read to please many palates.<br />Maddy Dangerfield is a fourteen year-old black girl living on the borderline of rural Mississippi/Louisiana. Though no dates are given, the time period seems to be the late 1960s or 70s. Maddy is engulfed in despair, a fragile link in a down- trodden family that appears to be without hope or future. A degrading, embittered, alcoholic father, Chevrolet, who is also maimed, is incapable of providing for his family though he is employed because his paycheck is already owed to Jesus the man who runs gambling in town and to the liquor his body craves. His wife, Faye totally lacking self-esteem, is a classic enabler, working herself to the bone to pay her husbands debts. They are the towns object of gossip and pity. There is no laughter; Maddy does not socialize with other children or hitch rides into town with friends for ice cream. She is immersed in an adult world and these adults are no prizes. Then Maddy adds fuel to the flames  when she draws a picture of a naked lady in red lipstick over the first page of the Book of  Genesis in Sunday School. As a punishment, she is banished to spend weekends nursing her aunt Pip, who is wasting away with breast cancer and herself banished in shame from the town and the family for committing an unforgivable sin. Maddy is drawn into the squandered life of Pip while pondering the issues of life, death, love and redemption.<br />Racism is rampant and this novel does not escape the stereotypical elements of a gothic southern novel: an uncle in prison and his friend hung for an alleged rape of a white woman, the desolate alcoholic stripped of his manhood who kowtows to whites, the white storeowners who cheat blacks out of their money, the strong black mother replete with a Mammy persona who is long-suffering, forever in church praising the Lord. A cast of secondary characters including an outcast neighbor, a young casket maker from New Orleans who has his eye on Maddy and a slow-witted man who meets a mysterious death all contribute to making this a well-rounded, unique storyline.<br />The literature of the last few years have highlighted the affluence and assimilation of African Americans touting their acquired status, this story gives us the ugliness up front and personal---, this is not reading for the faint at heart.  Maddys obsession with vaginas is a prominent part of this novel as is blood, breasts, lizards, and superstitions steeped in ignorance and tradition. Sometimes this novel was out there, thus the Morrison reference. Well written with illuminating imagery, the author places you there--but I had to ask myself if I really wanted to be. Nevertheless, it was refreshing to read yet another new, unique voice. 2003 promises to be a stellar year with writers such as Vernon and Danyel Smith (More Like Wrestling) who are taking bold risks in what is sometimes a saturated market of uniformity.

I look forward to this authors next offering.<br />Dera Williams<BR>APOOO BookClub	2003-02-16

Anna is enamored of Freddy as she calls him. He is a slave working on the Baltimore docks when she meets him. A captured man in the body of a proud, fiery man struggling to break the restraints society and life has placed on him. Self-taught, intelligent, well read, he and Anna, an illiterate domestic servant conspire for his freedom.<br /><br />Freddy is everything to Anna and she risks all to be with this handsome man. She comes to the marriage giving everything she possesses both financially and emotionally, older than he, and a little overweight. She realizes that his abolitionist friends and others think she is not fitting as his wife and then there is Otillie. Otillie is a German Jewess from Europe who is well traveled and educated, blonde, beautiful, slim, and white and she wants Anna's husband. She too risks everything, including her reputation to be with the man she loves------ despite the fact he is married.<br /><br />I had the pleasure of hearing Parker Rhodes read from her book as she put me in the heads of both Anna and Otillie. I felt Anna's pain as she grappled with being married to a man larger than life, adored by many, both black and white, hunted by slave catchers, and knowing she could never make him completely happy. Though Otillie was an unlikable character--- she scoffed as Anna's plain looks and unsophisticated ways--- it was difficult to place her in the role of villain at times because she was also a pawn in Douglass game as Anna was. In this fictionalized account of the women who loved him, Douglass is seen as no more or no less than a man. Yes, he was a great orator, gifted writer, statesmen, and abolitionist but still, just a man, albeit a black man with all the foibles and warts of any other man. An entertaining story this book was one of my top ten favorite books of 2002 and will go on my list of all-time favorites.

Paige, the oldest and Pinch, younger by two years are happily living with their mother surrounded by the familiar landmarks of San Antonio Park, Diamond Pool and Lake Merritt as their playgrounds. They are thrust into adulthood at ages fourteen and twelve when their mother's boyfriend, Seth, in a drug-infused rage, physically attacks the sisters. The girls runaway and their mother finds them and rents an apartment that she eventually leaves them in when she returns to her man. Thus the girls are more or less raising themselves among the burgeoning crack drug trade of Oakland. Pinch and Paige are like peanut butter and jelly; you see one, you see the other. Together they travel in a pack with Maynard, their long time childhood friend, Oscar, Jessica, Cedric, LaNelle, and Donnell and assorted acquaintances moving through life in a haze of 80s tunes floating in their young heads.<br />Pinch clearly has the strongest voice as she wrestles with how she fits in with the crowd, riding on the coattails of Paige. Silent, observant, and all knowing, at times she appears to be not a part of the adventures or misadventures of the crew, but lingering as an afterthought. The boys in this group are a mixture of basically middle-class/working class kids, who though they are college students become swept up by the glamour and allure of the drug-selling scene. Maynard, a manchild, whose parents have substance abuse problems, is forced into a role as provider, protector and eventually marriage and fatherhood. The girls, rarely voicing their fears and concerns to the guys, .... \\"I don't get into all his business all like that...\\" preferring to believe it is a temporary condition. In a constant state of denial of what their men are doing, they see only what they want.  \\"Our boys weren't typical vengeful ghetto Negroes.... \\"  Paige, a Cal Berkeley drop-out hooks up with Oscar, who also drops out of college to deal drugs and the two wander aimlessly into marriage. But it is not long before the fast money, flashy cars, and other expensive trappings begin to crowd in on them leading way for inevitable tragedy and life altering events. Lives are changed as friendships are tested and trusts are eroded. These are children growing up too quickly--- wanting to skip the hard part of adulthood and get right to the real living.<br />This reviewer found it necessary to step away many times in reading this story, some things were too close to what is going on now. The last few years have seen a series of novels showcasing the drug trade activity of Oakland and the thought of reading another rendition was somewhat daunting. But at no time did I think this was for commercial effect or gain. Instead, the raw truth was done tenderly while showing the good and bad of the area as well as the ambiance of a city that sits amidst some of the country's finest institutions of higher learning and culture.<br />Much of it is written in fragmented and run-together sentences, defying standard rules of English---- but Smith makes it work as she takes us into the heads, minds, and feelings of Paige and Pinch. Metaphors candidly jump off the pages weaving images of an era and place that become visible and remain lingering with readers. Oakland and surrounding areas are brought to life in her lyrical writing. Trying to pigeon hole her style, one sees glimpses of the staccato phrases of Sandra Cisneros, and the lyrical poetry of June Jordan, complex, at times convoluted, but even so this is a unique voice, one that will no doubt becoming classic and timeless to reign with the aforementioned authors.<br />I applaud the author for stepping out and taking a chance with her voice and thank her for the gift for which she has graced Oakland, her hometown, the Bay Area and the literary world.<br />Dera Williams<br />APOOO BookClubhis is a unique voice, one that will no doubt becoming classic and timeless to reign with the aforementioned authors.<BR>I applaud the author for stepping out and taking a chance with her voice and thank her for the gift for which she has graced Oakland, her hometown, the Bay Area and the literary world. <br />Dera Williams<BR>APOOO BookClub	2003-01-14

In Rochelle Aler's, A Younger Man, this formula is nicely done with the older woman, younger man theme. Veronica Johnson-Hamlin, a widow, is stranded on a road near her North Carolina mountain summer home when a handsome daredevil on a motorcycle offers his assistance. Though she tells him she has called her auto club, he insists on fixing her tire. Kumi Walker likes the package and everything that goes with it. He figures she is a few years older than his 32 years, but age is nothing but a number. All he wants in return is a home-cooked southern meal. He has been living in Paris for the past ten years and is now back temporarily to help his sister establish her new Bed & Breakfast Inn. He is estranged from his father, a physician, who as a member of an old southern black family, expected him to become a third generation doctor. A rebel, Kumi went into the armed forces and then went to France where he went to the culinary institute and is a renowned chef.<br />Veronica's southern dinner is a hit with Kumi and he is good company but she is hung up on the ten-year age difference. However, he loves her prematurely white hair and her beauty is undeniable. Gradually she finds out that they have much in common, herself also a renegade, having left her long established elite Atlanta family after college and studying art in France. A near assault in college hinders her feelings for intimacy and she eventually marries a man who is thirty years her senior and impotent. She loved her husband, a wealthy surgeon but his greedy grown children have tried to make her life miserable since his death, contesting the will and accusing her of influencing their father. It is one of the reasons she left Atlanta and retreated to North Carolina; to put some distance and time away from wagging tongues. She has sold her art gallery and is in the process of deciding her next move. Kumi has brought passion into her life. Will his family see her as another form of his rebellion? How will her family react to bringing him to her family reunion? And what will happen when it is time for him to return to Paris where he plans to open his own restaurant. Will either of them be able to walk away from a passion that is like no other?<br />This is an entertaining story that didn't have many surprises but was nevertheless a fun, escapist read that features the mores of old black southern families.

And what a fruitful treasure hunt it has been. The man was prolific and was a bonafide genius. I have always listed him as among my favorite authors but in the new millennium I have gained a new appreciation. I will venture to say he is my favorite writer of all time.<br /><br />If Beale Street Could Talk is a lesson in the injustices of America that existed in the 70s In New York and is still indicative of that great city today. Trish and Fonny are young lovers who believe in the American dream of marriage and family. Best friends since they were young children, they are aware of the racism that surrounds them as being black in America but nevertheless believe they have what it takes to make it, their love.<br /><br />That is until the day Fonny is arrested and thrown in jail for rape. What follows is a horror that tears at the reader's soul as we go through the pain and frustration with these characters of trying to prove a young black male's innocence, a near impossibility at this time period in our history. Trish is pregnant and working at a dead-end job but has the full support of her Renaissance family. Fonny, on the other hand, only has the support of his wearied father, who once owned a neighborhood business and now is subject to working at a job where he is made to feel less than a man. His wife is self-righteous and unapproachable while his grown daughters are frustrated \\"old maids\\" who with their imagined bourgeois airs have tried and convicted their brother.<br /><br />This story is a testament to the human spirit, of how a people prevail against all odds, telling a story that is so familiar to the Blues the title of the book symbolizes. Another James Baldwin classic, another American classic, not to be missed.<br /><br />Dera Williams<br />APOOO BookClub	2002-11-28

This book is especially endearing at this time of year when one turns to thoughts of cooking special food when coming together with loved ones.<br />I had the pleasure of hearing Lynn Ruth Miller's humorous story about her mother's Hanukkah blintzes at a reading in Oakland where I was also on the panel as a contributor to another book in the Cup of Comfort series. So much goes into the preparation of food than just ingredients. These recipes reflect the history, family lore, adventures, culture and of course the doses of love that are necessities in good food.<br />My daughter was flipping through the book checking out recipes for Thanksgiving and was constantly reading out loud the anecdotes and heartfelt stories. Dutch Breakfast Bread and Abuelita's Rice Pudding are just two examples of the richness of recipes and stories in this contribution.  These recipes offer a pinch of faith, a dash of strength, a tablespoon of love and a cup of comfort, a gift to America.	2002-11-27

He finds himself sharing a house with the Kourman family, Alaine, a government worker, Kene, a teacher and their young daughter, Mammi.  Unwittingly he finds himself intertwined in their lives including their troubled marriage while he himself is trying to reconcile the disintegration of his own marriage to a white woman back in Colorado.  Bertrand has never dated or been intimate with a black woman, a source of inner turmoil as well as a target for ridicule and wonderment in the village where he is staying.<br />Told alternatively in both third person and in first person journal form, the title refers to the constant chaotic dreams that at times are not only horrifying, but are downright scary, while others are very erotic, and frighteningly real. At times it is hard to tell when the dream ends and real life begins. Each day he sleeps more hours and develops unexplained illnesses.  Though Bertrand just wants to finish his research fellowship and go back home and finish his doctoral theses, he finds himself becoming more involved in Senegalese life and culture.  The beautiful, alluring Kene becomes an obsession, he is dreaming while awake, and he gets no respect from the Senegalese whom he has tried to convince he is their friend and native son.  Bertrand finds himself communicating in three languages, English, French and Wolof and yet still unable to fully make himself understood.<br />Culture, witchcraft, identity, and passion clash in this literary tale full of symbolism and surreal occurrences that belie the reader's sense of reality. It is also a lesson in how language and culture intersect and clash, how black Americans go to Africa in search of the Motherland and their \\"roots\\" and sometimes find themselves strangers in a land where mores, values and traditions are worlds apart.

Usually, it refers to a child that has distinct Negroid features whereas the parents may not appear so.  It can also refer to a child of two distinctly black parents who is born with white features.  The former is usually cause for concern when families are trying to \\"whiten or bleach\\" the line or pass into white society altogether.  This premise is the crux of the storyline of four generations of a family who has been fostered to believe that being white or white in appearance is the saving grace and desire of the black race.<br />Megan, Carrie, Ana, and Mignon, the women whose lives are told, have had their share of trials and tribulations with poverty, men, family, and self-esteem and independence issues. Raised on a Louisiana plantation, Megan is the product of a rape by the landowner, who in turn rapes both Megan and Carrie when they come of age, his own daughter and granddaughter.  If it sounds complicated, convoluted, and complex, it is.  But we find out later in the book the disastrous results of these complexities.  Meanwhile, Carrie suffers isolation and humiliation because she \\"reached back\\" and does not look like the rest of her light, bright, damn near white family.  Her \\"caramel\\" coloring guarantees that she will never be able to have the advantages of white skin or be able to passe blanc.  Some of her siblings do indeed move to New Orleans and cross over into the white world.  Carrie loves her childhood sweetheart, John, who is a dark brown skinned man ,  but marries a fair-skinned man because she believes that is best.  Her life is at first good but a series of circumstances causes her to question her choice and then she encounters John again.  Her daughter Ana \\"suffers\\" the same fate as Carrie and is \\"tan\\" colored, unlike her white- looking siblings.  She, in turn, is mistreated by both her siblings and father, a renowned minister. Ana's beauty and talent cannot be denied however and she becomes a singing sensation in Paris where her sense of worth is elevated, until again, as is the fate of the Devereaux women, she faces heartache.  Back home in Houston, she marries the near white Clark, whose background remains hidden for several years.  Ana's daughter Mignon, in trying to please her now passing for white father, marries a light skinned man.  As she matures and comes into her self-worth, she realizes her former choices and values have been misconstrued.<br />This book was my local book club selection and all kinds of emotions and comments were expressed.  The subject matter was not particular to everyone's liking-we felt the synopsis on the back of the book was misleading because it did not mention color issues--  but that aside, what we most agreed upon and which verified my feelings, is the immature writing style and the poor editing of this book.

While Cane River was well written and less intrusive, Reaching Back has an undeveloped writing style, though in the last few chapters the quality of writing improved greatly. Though the spelling and grammar appeares flawless, the content editing of this book put it in the category of many self-published books, that while it is entertaining-there is plenty of drama, a quick read, and flows satisfactorily, misses out on being a better final product.

I first read this novel about ten years ago as my introduction to Kincaid's writing and was both intrigued and in awe of her language, themes, and symbolic language.<br />Until she was nineteen years old, Lucy Potter had not ventured from her own little world on the small island where she was born.  Now she is living with a family and learning a culture that is very different from her own.  Lewis and Mariah and their four daughters want Lucy to feel like she is part of the family but at first she finds it difficult to fit in.  She just wants to do her duty and in her off-hours discovers a new world through her friend Peggy and sexuality through young men, Hugh and Paul.<br />Lucy often reflects on her life back on the island; the conflicts between she and her mother, and the British influence on the islanders. She remembers when she and her friends would read the Book of Revelations using the passages to terrify each other. She also remembers the time her mother showed her how to mix herbs that supposedly would cleanse a woman's womb but what they both knew was an abortion remedy. Lucy knows what is expected of her, to study for a respectable job like a nurse and to honor her family. She finds out that the tidy, neat world of the family she has come to love is not all it purports to be and how silence is a universal language.<br />Kincaid's language is outstanding in remembering her home; \\"the color of six o'clock in the evening\\" is just one example.  It is well known that her writing draws from her life experiences as in The Autobiography of My Mother and My Brother and I look forward to her latest offering, Mr. Potter which is reportedly based on her father's life.

The politics in an ivy league law school, the intricacies of judgeship appointments, the intimacies of familial and marital relationships, the insular world of the black elite, as well as suspense and intrigue are intersected and dissected in this thriller by a professor of law who has written several books of nonfiction. Most readers have debated whether he needed 650 pages in which to tell it, however this was my recent local book club selection and the consensus was that while the book was long, we were at a loss as to what to cut.<br />Every which way he turns, Talcott AKA Misha is being asked, \\"What are the arrangements?\\"  His father's death brings out a myriad of characters including Jack Ziegler, the man who caused the Judge's fall from grace, a mysterious woman on roller skates, and some mysterious guys who follow his every move.  What is the secret that has his sister Mariah looking for conspiracy theories, that causes his brother to be further estranged, and his cousin Sally in constant mental disorder?  How do the black and white chess pawns factor into all of this?<br />Talcott seems to have the world on his shoulders.  His law school colleagues think he has lost it, his philandering wife is up for a federal judgeship appointment, all the while he is being pursued by people who appear to want to harm him.  From a small town in Connecticut to Martha's Vineyard to Washington, D.C., readers are regaled with a whirlwind story of mystery. The characterizations are the crux of the book.

This quilt patterns that appear to have been used in the Underground Railroad as well as another pattern linked to Elm Creek Manor.  Sylvia, a master quilter and descendant of the Bergstrom family in Elm Creek, Pennsylvania is determined to find out.  In her search she encounters a diary of her great aunt Gerda.  In that diary we are drawn into the world of the pre-civil war period and the climate of the country, the work of abolitionists, and the world of quilting.<br />Time and time again, Sylvia returns to Gerda's story, which is full of the history of how the Bergstroms made their way from immigration from Germany and assimilating into American culture.  Their strong faith is tested in many ways.  Gerda faces isolation, heartbreak, and betrayal by both men and to her dismay, family.  Family folklore has the Bergstroms as a part of the abolitionist movement but the diary yields more concrete details of just how much of a part they did contribute.  One is drawn to the story of this family's role in slaves escaping to Canada as well as their bravery<br />The story is deftly woven as the quilts in the story are throughout this story.  Readers are treated to the joys and intricacies of the quilting world, this beautiful art that is esteemed in both the black and white world.  This subject is of particular interest to this reviewer because of the legacy quilting holds in my family.

Yes, he's back, the invincible Basil, who has made nine appearances in E. Lynn Harris' books and like a black cat, he has nine lives.  Raymond, the tall sensual brother who has made peace with his sexuality, is also back.  But this is not just their story.  It is smoothly interwoven in a web of other tales revolving around scenes of New York City, which include power and corruption at a high profile magazine, the making and breaking of relationships, and the tragedy of 9/11.<br />Raymond leaves Seattle to take the position of CEO of Bling Bling magazine and to make a new start in life after a major disappointment in his love life. Davis McClinton is a wealthy high-powered brother and Raymond's ruthless boss. He has several financial  holdings reminiscent of a combination of Donald Trump/Robert Johnson type.  What are the secrets he is hiding? Zola Norwood, an intelligent brown sugar beauty, is the editor-in-chief of Bling Bling on her way to realizing her dream of starting her own publication.  But she has paid heavy prices, juggling three men among them the very much married McClinton.  And then there is Basil, a wiser, more mature Basil--- but for how long?--- who is now a father.<br />As always with Harris' writing, he gives compelling characterizations, a page turning storyline, and settings that puts you there. We see New York in its finest, Broadway shows, parties of the rich and famous, high-powered corporate stakes, and on its worst day, the tragedy of September 11, 2001.  Because of the horror of that day, values are re-evaluated, life-altering decisions are made and relationships of all kinds are tested.  With impressive secondary characters, some old ones-- need  I mention Yancey and Ava make their appearances-along with the new ones-- the wild, wacky buddies of Zola, this story will have readers laughing and crying.<br />This one, while not his best--Invisible Life and Just As I Am cannot be duplicated-- is an improvement over his last two novels. Much has been said about the recycling of Basil, who has been ever present in all novels, and his shenanigans.  Hopefully this story will satisfy some of his detractors and we won't need to hear from him anymore.  But I am a die-hard fan and if Harris writes another book and puts Basil is in it, I will still be at my favorite book store on release day wrangling for the last copy.has been said about the recycling of Basil, who has been ever present in all novels, and his shenanigans.

Kristal will not accept that her husband's death was an accident as it is ruled. Then another firefighter comes up dead and then another.  Jasmine, daughter of a veteran San Jose policeman, suddenly has her hands full.  All kinds of people turn up in her trail seeking answers including her ex-husband, old lovers, and long-dead people.<br />What are the real reasons people are being killed?  Her ex, who has remarried, is asking for a reconciliation.  His reappearance in her life reminds her that she was unable to have children when they were married and now his new wife is expecting a child. It is enough to drive a person to drink.  Unfortunately, Jasmine is a recovering alcoholic and Johnnie Walker keeps calling her name. The plot is like a connect-a-dot drawing with a cast of characters so numerous, the reader will almost need a scoreboard. Everyone time someone mentions a name, Jasmine goes to that person and they in turn connect to another possible suspect.<br />I applaud Ms. Tiller's efforts in writing and completing her first novel, however I would be remiss in not pointing out that this novel was plagued with numerous misspellings, grammar problems and structure.  I had to put the book down and come back to it telling myself to overlook the lack of editing and try to get to the meat of the story.  Furthermore I did not feel an affinity for Jasmine.  She seemed to be drifting through the plot leaving a bland presence.  Her character could have been developed so much better, in the same vein as Tamara Hayle or Kinsey Millhone.<br />I enjoyed the setting of the story in the Bay Area with references to Oakland, Berkeley and other locations that Jasmine traveled in her quest for the truth.  I admit I was surprised at the identity of the killer.  I understand Ms. Tiller plans a series with this P.I. and I will be eager to see how the character is further developed.<br />Dera<br />Apooo Bookcluberies with this P.I. and I will be eager to see how the character is further developed.<br />Dera <BR>Apooo Bookclub	2002-08-01

Gates obtained the manuscript of this fictionalized autobiography of the mysterious Hannah Crafts, a slave woman.  It has yet to be determined if in fact that was the author's real name or a fictitious one. Also in question is the validity of the story.  I think Gates has established a good argument of proclaiming this the first narrative written by a female fugitive slave usurping his previous discovery of Harriet Jacob of Our Nig. Galvanized by the discovery that the manuscript was formerly owned by Dorothy Porter Wesley, former librarian at Howard University, Gates does an excellent job of authenticating the manuscript with ink and paper specialists.<br /><br />The story of Hannah Crafts' escape from slavery and how her mixed blood was instrumental in the facilitation of that escape is unremarkable in the respect that we have read and heard it before.  The figure of the tragic mulatto is common among slave narratives, the trials and tribulation of being enslaved, suffering the cruelties of the institution yet not considering oneself the average slave.  Indeed Hannah was a house slave and until she ran away, she had not incurred any real hardship.  When she is faced with the possibility of being forced to marry a slave she deems beneath her as well as the terror of moving to the slave quarters amidst the squalor and poverty of it all, she rebels.<br /><br />A white woman taught her to read and write and she served in the household of educated masters where books were aplenty.  This probably accounts for the flowery, lyrical writing style reminiscent of Jane Austen and other writers of that time.<br /><br />This book is one that will stay in the personal library especially of those who are history, African American studies, and genealogy enthusiasts.  The reading of this has re-established my interest in slave narratives and the genealogy, history and culture of our race.<br /><br />Dera Williams<br />APOOO BookClubams  APOOO BookClub	2002-07-26

So it is with A Cup of Comfort : Stories that warm your heart, lift your spirit, and enrich your life.  This book, slices of life of those, who stop and honor what still matters in this country, the commonality and wonder of the human spirit.<br />Some of the stories are several pages long and others like Lynn Ruth Miller's Sing Your Song, is only two pages long, yet packs a powerful message of perseverance.  The Crying Chair by May Marcia Lee Norwood tells of a teacher's compassion for her students' need to express their pain and The Lady in the Blue Dress by Edie Scher is a testament to the power of faith.<br />This book is by my bed and I indulge myself in one of the stories several times a week and promises to be a mainstay in my collection of inspirational reading.  I applaud the editor, Colleen Sell for her vision for the Cup of Comfort concept and the Adams Media Corporation for believing in it, which has branched into a series.

Jordan Davis, a young African American male of twenty eight, is content with his life, living in Santa Barbara, California and teaching a course or two a semester while working on his doctoral thesis in literature.  Life is good or at least most of the time.  That is when his best friend and roommate Ned is not needling him about the scarcity of blacks living in Santa Barbara, or when he isn't so sexually obsessed with \\"that white girl\\" Mary, or when he is not wrestling with his confusion of the kind of relationship he wants from Trisha, a young well-to-do black senior at the university.<br />Having escaped his inner-city Los Angeles neighborhood, Jordan is comfortable with his life in a city that offers him serenity even if the black population is only one percent.  He can live with that. Trisha comes from a family of privileged black folk, a family that is committed to civil rights in Santa Barbara and has high expectations of their children.  She belongs to AKA sorority, is beautiful and intelligent, on her way to law school and a virgin at twenty-two years old.  His friends tell him she is what he needs, she is the one to settle down with and Jordan knows there is no half-stepping with Trisha; she is the marrying kind.  He has strong feelings for her; with Mary it is just a sex thing, but then the most tempting, exotic, beautiful woman walks into his Japanese Lit class and rocks his world.  Daphne, of undetermined race, her heritage hardly anyone is able to determine, has a troubled past.  Having traveled over the world, she is back living with her rich parents and is smitten with Jordan, as he is with her. But she has brought back a lifetime of baggage and all the drama that accompanies it.<br />Ned announces he is moving to D.C.  He cannot bring himself to date white women; the black women in Santa Barbara, the AKAs and the Deltas reject him, (he is an artist type) leaving Jordan further isolated and trying to deal with his issues.  There are secondary characters and story lines involving Trisha's family's racial incidents, which reflect black life in a town where blacks people are scarce. There is also a scene that further exposes the city's disquieting relationship with African Americans when two members of the famed Harlem Globetrotters, in town for a university benefit, are mistaken for bank robbers and held at gun-point by police. At his book signing appearance in Oakland, Tervalon revealed he went to undergraduate school at U. C. Santa Barbara and met his wife there, who is from a prominent African American family, so he knows of what he writes.  He is also from inner-city Los Angeles.  I detect a little truth telling here, which is all good.<br />Tervalon manages to weave a multi-layered tale of many dimensions.  Issues of race, identity, class, love and passion, and one's place in the world are explored in depth.  As is his trademark, there is a hint of mystery, and a Faulkneresque aura in the irony and tragedy of the story.  I would highly recommend this book as one that will give you insight to another aspect of living one's dreams.

She has one unfulfilling date after another.  What a way to start a new year.  Ever hopeful she goes to a party and meets a nice enough young man, only to have to accompany him to the emergency room where Dr. Zack Warner is on duty.  He thinks this lady that came in with another man is a real looker but doesn't speak up.  Then he encounters her again in the emergency room with yet another of her dates.<br /><br />Is Vivian a disabling man magnet or is she just going through a streak of bad luck?  Zack doesn't know but he comes to the rescue again for yet another of Vivian's male friends, this time, on a ski trip.  Vivian wonders what Zack thinks of her; the only time they have contact is when she is in the presence of a man who needs medical attention.  As fate would have it, Zack and Vivian are connected through that six degrees of separation that so often is a part of life.  Through circumstances neither one of them have control over Zack is the one who needs to be nursed and Vivian is elected to be that nurse.  Through all of this, though they are attracted to one another, they cannot seem to get together.<br /><br />I liked that the reader got to see a character that was less than perfect, as a matter of fact, Vivian had idiosyncrasies I could relate to.  The story was peppered with things and people that irritated her.  At first I thought the protagonists missed too many opportunities to connect but that was the irony of the whole plot being they were on a collision course of love.	2002-06-21

Another man, another woman feels they have been abandoned in their relationship.  This novel captures the essence of a love and marriage gone sour and the path that has brought it to this point.<br />Husband and wife authors Milner and Chiles, who are known for their nonfiction- he said/she said books on love and relationships, employ the same technique in their first novel.  We hear from Randy first, who is in Paris as an advertising executive.  He left his disgruntled wife Mekki, a dress designer, back home lonely, frustrated, and dissatisfied.  Meanwhile Mekki finds solace in the arms of Marcus, Randy's best friend.  A trip to Paris to try to repair the damage that has already been done proves to be disastrous.  Can this marriage be saved?<br />I loved the writing, style and the voices of Randy and Mekki.  We got to see their less than perfect personas.  All of their fears, dreams, and fantasies were revealed. I didn't always like these characters.  In fact, I spent a great deal of time cursing Mekki under my breath. Randy is an overachiever yet he has insecurities and sensitivities that most men will not admit to. I often wondered how these two got together in the first place (he wants children, she does not) because it seemed there was little communication to begin with.  A secondary story line involving Mekki's parents' crumbling long time marriage is also a lesson about how precarious and vulnerable our relationships can be.<br />For me this was a mature read though the protagonists were in their late 20s, early 30s.  It methodically detailed a message that was conveyed throughout the novel.  Most couples do not put enough time and energy into making a marriage work (divorce statistics prove that).  I enjoyed the glimpses of Paris and the differences in work ethics of the French and the Americans as well as the office politics.  The one blight for me was Marcus and his reasons for stabbing his best friend in the back. I felt his character was underdeveloped because I had to make assumptions as to why.

Three generations of women, the Pines women of Mulberry Georgia, who are at a crossroads in their lives are visited by guardian angels.  In a matter of hours these angels guide their spirits and change the courses of their lives.  Fans of Ms. McElroy Ansa have come to expect the world of mysticism and spiritual realm to convene her stories.<br />Lily Paine Pines, who is one of those big women, you know Wonder Woman, who sets the world on fire but can also make a mean pan of corn bread. But what has she passed on to her daughter, who she nurtured, that she has too little time to raise her own daughter? True to her MO Lily feels she has to come to the rescue of LaShawndra, her granddaughter.  She gets up in the middle of the night to yet try to fix another one of her messes.  But Miss Moses steps in and shows her she doesn't have to do it all.<br />Sandra Pines, Lily's daughter doesn't have time to be bothered.  Her own child, LaShawndra is not only an inconvenience, she is a source of embarrassment and pain.  LaShawndra is a constant reminder of her past mistakes and she doesn't let her forget it.  Plus she reminds her of the man that abandoned her.  She feels she has done her part as a mother and relishes her successes.  But what legacy has she left her daughter?  Nurse Bloom helps her see that she knows better.<br />LaShawndra has every advantage provided by Mama Mama Lily, and her mother, Sandra.  But does she appreciate it? Nooooo.  She is too busy trying to be the girl in the videos India Arie talks about.  But if it seems like LaShawndra is shallow, is lacking morals and is self-absorbed with corrupted values, it isn't her fault, not really.  Yes, she knows better but it is too easy to accept that she is a mess-up, a mistake, a ho', an accident waiting to happen and can't do any better.  Yet, making another bad decision, she does the only think she does best, run.  But when she takes flight she accepts a ride from a cool old lady, Miz Liza Drake, and as they travel the road along the river that never ends, LaShawndra is forced to accept responsibility for her own actions.<br />This book is a commentary on the state of family structure today in general and the black family in particular. I see what the author was trying to do especially when she was here for a book signing.  She talked in length about why she wrote this book. It is her belief that most black families have these three women in their families. The older women are big women, wonder women in disguise, the women in their 40s are too busy making it and don't give their kids enough attention and therefore have failed our young people in their teens and twenties, who are growing up with false values. Yes, LaShawndra is an extreme but there are some out there like her who live on the edge.  Well, what you gon' do?

But there are cracks in the carefully constructed facade that are threatening to crumble to pieces.  After a devastating miscarriage, Madison has becomes withdrawn from her husband, and Wes, unable to express his feelings, becomes equally inaccessible to his wife. When tragedy strikes, secrets, lies, and deceit are discovered.  Madison hardly has enough time to grieve for her husband when she is confronted with the evidence of Wes's most deceitful deeds.<br />Madison is comforted by Zachary Holman, Wes's friend, and a successful homebuilder.  He forces Madison to face her fears and impels her to look within herself to be the compassionate, loving woman that he knows she is.  Meanwhile Madison feels compelled to keep up the masquerade of the grieving, devastated widow but because she is in the public eye, wolves in sheep's clothing are constantly looking for dirt.  Madison also has to contend with Wes's parents, a self absorbed couple, who value class and economics above everything else to the extent they are also carrying around demons that lies and secrets have created.<br />There are imposing secondary characters who enrich the storyline as well as support the main characters.  This novel is a lesson in what can happen when a couple lacks communication in their marriage, how life choices and circumstances can change momentarily, and how one woman faces her tribulations with her head held high.

Malik is in like flint, makes new friends and he is enjoying the masquerade until the proverbial mess hits the fan.

He makes one believe you are actually in Kingston, South Carolina and Ghana. What happens when you find that person with whom you would spend your last night on earth?<br />Carey McCullough, a successful playwright, has known many women and loved them all.  And then he meets Frances, a woman he feels he has known his whole life.  Could they have been soul mates 400 years ago in Africa?  Their relationship is not easy.  He has doubts about this woman's motives who he believes saved his life at a time when he was guilt ridden about his father's death.  Indeed family dynamics weighs heavily throughout this novel.  Carey's own family background is convoluted with roots in Ghana, Jamaica and Cuba.  Torn about his own religious beliefs, Carey gives Frances an ultimatum and then flees Kingston to go to South Carolina where his best friend Kwabena and his family resides and there is capitulated into a turn of events he find himself helpless to reverse .  Kwabena, to Carey, is a picture of an upright pious man, but it turns out that Kwabena has his own demons of which Carey is inextricably entangled.<br />With his propensity to weave language in the most compelling prose with remarkable metaphors and foreshadowing, readers are left with a feeling of surreal awe.  I turned the last page and sighed.  The litmus test of a well-told story for me is how a book resonates days after I have finished it.

I just wasn't up to reading about another downtrodden, poverty-stricken, living in the ghetto story.  But it is more than that.  This masterpiece is a commentary on a way of life in the early part of the 1900s, a life that many African Americans endured and survived coming through victorious.<br />Richard Wright recalls his poverty-stricken childhood, abandoned by a father, and physically abused and misunderstood by the adults in his life.  Uncomfortable among his own people, he didn't fit in with the lifestyle of the blacks in his life nor could he abide the Jim Crow shuffling he had to do with whites.  He found he could not compromise his values and knew he had to leave the south.  The poverty was startling yet he chose to go back to live with his mother and grandmother when he could have stayed with an uncle where there was plenty of food.<br />With only an nine grade education, he was self-taught, reading and disciplining himself to pursue what he wanted most, to write.  And write he did.  He wrote stories and had them published when he was still in school and when he moved to Chicago he wrote for the Communist Party.  With the Party, Wright thought he had found his niche, but again, he was the odd man out never conforming to their ideals.<br />As I read I kept saying, this is enough already.  The poverty, the abuse, the Jim Crow and racism was a wearing me down.  But this was a man who rose above his circumstances to have a life that was worth pursuing and living.  I am intrigued by this man and his life and look forward to reading his most recent biography.	2002-04-09

Clara plodded through her miserable conditions in the ghettos of Kingston,  Jamaica, a town called Greenwichtown.<br />We see how another culture in the Diaspora of Africa struggles with their way of life and families.  Faye was given no choice in who would raise her.  Her sister, Flo supposedly could provide a better life.  Sometimes she did, sometimes she did not. When Flo had a man, life was, if not good, was bearable and there was money for food and school. Faye learned survival skills but she also had a heart to pull herself out of poverty and despair through education.<br />Unfortunately she learned the lessons of the heart by being betrayed by a boy she thought loved her.  Was she not worthy of love?  Would her dreams be deferred by the disease that seemed to plague every young girl in Greenwichtown?<br />Joyce Palmer has written a compelling, stunningly real view of our Sister's lives in the real Jamaica, not the one we see on the cruises and advertisements.

Saved, sanctified and fill with the Holy Ghost, his mistreatment of his first wife, Deborah, his discard lover, Esther, his present wife Elizabeth and his son John is what kept him from being the minister that he was in his youth before he fell from grace.  Elizabeth, proud and determined, she wanted John to have the same love from Gabriel that he gave to his other \\"natural\\" sons. A woman who accepted her circumstances; she has lost her first true love, Richard and was resigned to accepting Gabriel's hand in marriage to redeem her sin. Florence, too proud for her own good Bitter, resentful of her brother Gabriel and now perhaps facing death, she has lived a live of unfulfilled dreams.<br />Where we they all stand after they haved poured their hearts and souls on the alter?  Secrets, dreams, hopes are revealed.  Told in a language of complexity full of allegories, symbolism, Bible similies, it is no wonder it is taught in universities around the country.

A murder of prominent blacks who all have something in common.<br />A cop who is driven by guilt and the past.  A murderer who has something to prove by specific targets.<br />Danny Cavanaugh is a cop just like his father was.  Raised in the Detroit inner-city, he has adopted a black persona.  He \\"talks and acts black\\".  Does he hate himself as his psychiatrist suggests?  He is also having his share of problems indirectly as a result of his lifestyle.  His black girlfriend seems to be outgrowing the relationship and he has dreams about his late mother.  How did she really pass away?.  He is also worried about his father, an alcoholic, who spends his days secluded at home.<br />When prominent African Americans in the community are killed, Danny and his partner are paired up with a saucy FBI agent, a black woman who thinks she can read the case and read Danny also.<br />What is the common factor in these murders.  When they realize what it is, it is a race to prevent more murders.<br />Meanwhile there are a string of other murders throughout the city that are reportedly done by a group of young brothers.  They are committing mayhem and not only are the police looking for them but they have managed the ire of some bad guys.<br />Gary Hardwick does a good job of giving the readers a view of Detroit inner city life through not only a cop's eyes but also the dynamics of the black community and the idiosyncrasies.  Class and color lines are explored as well family relationships and the pain of a man finding his way in a country that puts everyone in boxes determined by race.  Hardwick has a new fan in this reviewer.  I am ordering his other books.	2002-02-11

After reading a number of literary type books in the last month, I read this under recommendation as a quick page turner.  There are a number of relationship drama novels out in the African American market that address men who are manipulated by the women in their life but I must say this one is for the record.<br />Richard, a dentist from a good standing family is married to Estelle, daughter of a con artist ex-con mother, Rubylee.  From the beginning Rubylee manipulates and berates Estelle, who in turn does the same to Richard, emasculating him and making a total fool of him.  The ultimate insult is when Estelle empties their bank account in order to buy Rubylee a car.  Richard runs into Nina, his aerobics instructor, who is also an accountant.  Nina is also in an unhappy marriage with a man who tries to control and manipulate her. A series of circumstances and drama brings them together in the Bahamas after they have both decided their marriages are over. They discover their mutual attraction is the real thing and but then they have to go back to reality.<br />This reviewer had a hard time reconciling Richard's beat-down character as being the kind of take-charge man that Nina would be attracted to. I found taking the kind of mental abuse from his wife and mother-in-law for eight long years as a bit extreme and then allowing the mil and her cast of hooligans move in turning their home into a ghetto paradise was over the top.<br />I liked the secondary drama of the mother-daughter relationship between Nina and her 22 year old daughter Gracie.  I felt Nina's disappointment in her daughter's decisions and would have liked to seen a little more of the dynamics of how a women sometime live vicariously through their daughters. I often wondered if this was supposed to be a comedy-drama or a serious drama novel. The sex scenes in the Bahamas added spice to this otherwise run of the mill relationship novel.ise run of the mill relationship novel.	2002-01-02

But the old adage opposites attract seem to apply in this case.<br />Jordan is a successful writer of mysteries who is an accident always ready to happen who has adopted five children.  Mia moves next door to Jordan and his brood back in her old urban New Jersey neighborhood much to her  social climbing mother's chagrin.<br />She immediately becomes involved with the precocious children who seize on the idea that Mia would make a great mom and they set out to make it happen.<br />Mia thinks Jordan is a clumsy nerd and he thinks she is a high maintenance career woman but their opinions change of each other and the attraction is dynamite. But they are not moving fast enough for the kids so with the help of their grandfather they devise a plan that has Mia and Jordan locked up in the downstairs playroom overnight.  Sparks fly but their courtship is not without hitches.  Mia's busy work schedule, her mother's matchmaking meddling, a journalist who has the hots for Jordan and the issues of trust are just a few of the roadblocks to making this a smooth ride.<br />This was a lively romance with plenty of sensuous love scene, well-developed characterizations including the children, and realistic scenes.  I loved the feel of the commitment both Mia and Jordan had for their city and the realness of their characters.  This is a top romance for 2001.	2001-11-26

Inside of this little book was heart wrenching anguish and I just could not read it through without interruptions, reading other things and giving myself a rest.<br />Is Ms. Derracotte a victim of the tragic mulatto syndrome or is some of her anguish of her own making?<br />Coming from an upper class African American family that has kept the blood line \\"light and bright\\" for generations, the author's journey as a white- looking black woman comes to a climax when she moves to an all-white exclusive neighborhood in New York.  It's not that they don't want her there, they just don't want her trying to assimilate into their way of life.  The fact that she conducted the initial business of purchasing the house without her husband (he was more identifiable black, thus  she participated in the \\" passing\\" game.) should have been a clue, nevertheless she was determined to make them accept her.  And this is where I had conflict.  Why would a black woman who was raised around other affluent blacks, accepted and identified as black, want to be in these people's country clubs and social circles?  Why did she not avail herself to the groups that she grew up among, The Links, Jack and Jill, etc. and be happy where she would be accepted.  Even as a poet/writer there are groups to belong, many of them interracial who will accept one on the basis of common goals.<br />More than a book on a woman conflicted by her blackness of lack thereof is the sad commentary on race identity and how America has pitted blacks among each other based on skin color going back to slavery.  Nella Larson, Jessie Fauset,  and Wallace Thurman and numerous other authors  have written on the this issue of characters who are conflicted and the schizophrenic existence they live.  Also how one's family views and upbringing affects how we feel about ourselves.  When pride in one's race and self and not enough self-love is not stressed enough then we have these kind of stories.  Some blacks of the author's background have similar stories, others do not go through this much drama.<br />I met Ms. Derracotte about three years ago when she was a writer-in-residence at Mills College here in Oakland.  I went to her reading, met her and have to say that she seems more at peace with herself.  She is a cofounder of a writers retreat for African American poets.

This hauntingly beautiful tale of a &quot;scarlet&quot; woman and the small town without pity was an exercise in human nature. Sugar comes to Bigelow, a small African American town in Arkansas, in 1955 to live in a house next door to Pearl and Joe. Fifteen years earlier their daughter Jude was brutally murdered. There is something about Sugar that reminds Pearl of her beloved daughter and while the whole town shuns her, she befriends her. Sugar brings out the youth and makes Pearl laugh and enjoy life. Pearl has not laughed so much since before Jude died. Pearl, the virtuous wife and mother, pillar of the church has even taken to dying her hair and visiting the juke joints with Pearl and taken Joe with her. The town is horrified at Pearl taking up with Sugar and their back- biting curiosity turns to venom.<br />Sugar, abandoned, as a child and growing up around brothels just does what she know best, make men happy. She knows secrets about Bigelow that no one else knows. Sugar has never known love and when she meets Pearl's son she finds out what it is, alas, she is unable to accept it. A tragedy unfolds with devastating consequences that reveal the events of fifteen years prior.<br />This book is written in rich detail, realistic characterization and superb writing. This writer's ability to capture the look and feel of the 50s Jim Crow south and the people who inhabit this small town are amazing and there is no doubt this is a literary masterpiece. I'm told there will be a sequel; I can hardly wait.	2001-09-13

And should be interpreted as just that,a fun book to be read and taken with a grain of salt. Although this little book makes it clear who IS and who IS NOT, it is not a bible or even a guide to the upper class/middle class black women.  Who would want to be known as being so shallow? Sure there are some truths regarding origins and status, but some of the reviewers here seem to be quite taken with identifying with these stereotypes to the point of putting down those who didn't grow up as a BAP.  I guess these Bettys and Bohos look down their noses at the the Butterflies (let's not mention the Bogus), those who moved into BAPtitude through achievement and schooling.  The distinction is made here between a BAP and a Buppie which is key point.  Being a BAP is mainly about attitude.  It was good to see a book of this type; there are certainly enough books about the negative aspects of black women in the media but I would like to see a stronger analysis with less emphasis on materialism and more on what they represent to the community (and better editing). The four women who wrote this are all accomplished women and it would be interesting to know their stories and how they became BAPS.  This is a fun quick read to take on vacation this summer.	2001-07-25

When his co-worker, Gina, proved to be an easy lay, he became ashamed of his actions.  His friend Papa Doc proved to be not only a friend but a savior of sorts by believing in him. Because of Papa Doc Prodigy started doing volunteer work and developed a big brother/father relationship with a cute little boy named Blake.

Dazed and confused for sure. Also shallow, materialistic, and immature. Tony and his friends maneuver their way through the young professional black elite of Houston, the Bumpies or Buppies, if you please.  They have a rating system for women.  Light skin and long hair are big pluses.  If she comes from an &quot;acceptable family&quot;, even better.  The situations and dialogue are definitely in keep it REAL.  This book had me laughing out loud on the airplane on my vacation.  What wouldn't Tony say.  But this is how it was in the 90s' and still is.  While it made me laugh, I had to shake my head at some of the shallow shenanigans.  Though Tony tried to come across as a regular nice guy who just happened to have a degree and a corporate job, he had some snobbish mannerisms.  I want to believe that his rejection of Cynthia was not just because of she was a clerk who didn't have a college degree and was raised on the wrong side of Houston's track, but because the girl was a straight up hoochie in disguise.  While I didn't always like Tony, the reality is their are thousands of young black men who think and act as he does thinking that women are put here for their taking.  Some of these men mature, unfortunately a great number don't.  He was constantly playing games breaking up with his college love Monica so he could play without guilt and then making up when he grew tired of playing outside.  The women portrayed were a variance of young black women out there playing the game, some as well as the fellas.  One thing I can say they may have partied hearty, but they knew to make it to church front and center on Sunday morning. LOL  That is one stable constant ingrained in the African American culture and that is what kept Tony and his host of partners in crime from being completely dazed and confused.ly dazed and confused.	2001-07-04

Colin is being manipulated by Stacy who treats him like a child.  Dexter has gotten himself in a bind fathering a child with a woman he can barely stand.  And Mike thinks he wants a woman who was the college tramp and proclaims now to be a born-again Christian.  But is he chasing Sharice in order not to think about the sweet young thing that he is supposed to be big brother to. This book had so many funny scenes and lines, it kept me laughing.  There were some memorable and touching moments as these young men loved and grew, well three of them anyway.  :0) Look out for the scene with the fruit and whipped cream.  Oooh la la.	2001-06-16

How much abuse can one woman take?  I kept asking this question as Gina, the middle-child of the family continuously endured her husband's verbal and physical abuse.  This is yet another family drama, one of several that are out this year involving African American families and their issues.  Like A Day Late and a Dollar Short and Resurrecting Mingus, there are secrets that threaten to tear the fabric of family life. Also the issue of caring for an ailing parent and how the children reacts in the wake of their own problems is very realistic. Sydney, the oldest child, seemingly has it all together.  A great husband and child, successfully self-employed, and living the bumpie life but she has long kept a secret that is affecting her relationship with her husband. Rick, the only boy is hot-headed and self-centered but he loves Samantha, his live-in love.  But will he be able to hold off her demands for more of a committment and still keep her happy? Gina has a well-paid job, is self-sufficient and a beautiful home. When will she see her self-worth?  The resulting circumstances are drastic and life-altering.  This is was a quick read that keeps the reader turning the pages to find out what happens next.  However it seems the author was trying to cover several issues and none of them were fully addressed with a concrete closure.  The narrator's voice also tended to have a tone that was judgmental.	2001-06-01

He loves his fiancee Millie, but the allure of Bee Cole is too much temptation.  How far will he go?  How low will he go?  This book explores some of things you may have dreamed or thought about but don't have the nerve.  On-line sex chats, menage a trois, swinging; this is the world that is explored.  The book however gives just enough and doesn't saturate you with detail that would could otherwise make this a work of borderline pornography.  This is very tastefully done and has some humorous scenes.	2001-05-25

Self-aborbed, color-struck, ignorant Freda thinks the word revolves around her.  She thinks her looks, such as they are, is the key to getting and holding a man.  Ray Marshall becomes her target and she leaves with him in disgrace from her hometown in the Bayou for New Orleans.  The story tells of her what becomes of her life with her friends, relatives and neighbors.  There are a host of characters including Freda's children, grandchildren, Ms. Mabel, Pearl-Elizabeth and Ethel. This story weaves elementsof voodoo, love and marriage and betrayal with what should have been five stars but wasn't because there were issues in a story in New Orleans that could have been explored more extensively.  Why was there so many issues of color-struck hatred among these people?  What is behind it?  More history about Louisiana's legacy with this issue should have been forthcoming for a more comprehensive view of what was going on here.  This was a good storyline that covered several generations but there was something missing in the curse.	2001-05-20

How strongly do circumstances as a child effect your family and marital relationships later on in life?<br />I felt the &quot;We are family, got all my sisters with me&quot; ending was a little too pat, but Terry has characterizations down like no other.

I finished reading this book almost a month ago but I just wasn't ready to write a review at that time.  I needed to think on it for a minute. I had read several reviews and was eager to get into it.  This book was a good read but it just wasn't what I expected.  From the reviews I really thought it was about a sister who gets tired of her long permed hair and cuts it off and goes natural and finds herself and makes some kind of political statement about black womenhood, self-esteem, self-empowerment, et al. Well, Venus does in a way finds herself but not quite how I envisioned. I thought the storyline would carry us through the various reactions and experiences because she has made a drastic change in her appearance.  There were some reactions, I just thought there would be more regarding corporate America and other areas.  Instead it seemed it was not about the hair but about the issues and baggage that plagued her. Venus nurtured a relationship with Clint, was there for him through the tough years of medical school and when she presented him with an ultimatum, he couldn't be a man about it and step up to the plate.  I won't spoil the rest for those who haven't read the book, but he kicked her in the stomach. I understand his point too, the man always has his ego and pride to protect. But the premice still seemed to be that from all the confidence Venus gained when she cut off her hair (shackles) in the end her happiness was still defined by having a man.  That was the way it seemed to me.  Again I don't want to say anymore. The book was a indeed a page turner so that is why I rated it f stars. It is always a treat to hear a fresh new voice.  I will definitely read the author's future books.	2001-02-11

The stories are diverse yet similar.  Bright, misunderstood, sticking out like sore thumbs because they were of color and intelligent.  That is not the way it is supposed to be.  Why is it African Americans are ridiculed for being smart.  I read Kunjufu's book some years ago when my daughter was in middle school, Black Peer Pressure: To be Popular or Smart.  Why must you choose.  I am trying to remember my childhood experiences.  I cannot remember being ridiculed for doing well in school.  It seemed that was the norm for my group and the kids seem to have more respect for one another.  I know this is unusual.  I think about my brother who is now a well-known cardiologist in the Bay Area and when I look back on it, he must have felt isolated because he was one of those super-smart, gifted students. From the first story of Prince which was heart-wrenching.  He was truly a testament to the poverty and hardship.  He proved he could succeed against the oods.  So, it is with Malik who had a drug-addicted mother.  These young men's stories is in contrast to some of the more affluent of the group.  Maria, Rob, and Steve had all of the amenities to have a good head start, well-eduacated, financially secure, and good neighborhoods.  However I must say, I was disappointed that these students felt they had little in common with other black students because of their status.  And it seemed their attitudes were reinforced by their parents attitudes who seemed to feel if it's white, its right.  I am trying to reconcile these parents with the generation that had to strive for basic civil rights in housing and education.  Where was the pride in being black.  Why were they not going to black churches and putting their children in contact with other young black people with groups such as Jack and Jill or church youth groups? I always thought it was the generation these students that lost the black pride, not their parents who I guess are in their forties, fifties, and sixties.  Claudio and Alessandro had to do with the problem of being both black and Latino and all the trials associated with being of a double culture.  So often in Latin cultures, children are told they are Latino and then they get out into the world where no one will let them forget they are black.  That can be a rude awakening when culture and color clash. The bi-racial students angst of being between two world, not knowing where they belong.  This story was also very well told in &quot;Black, White,Other&quot; by Lise Funderburg.  Christina and Susanna's black fathers evidently had problems with their black identities.  It seems in these and many bi-racial families they do no discuss race, as if not talking about it, it won't be a problem.  But as they find out, these issues need to be discussed.  Sure these kind of parents say they just want their children to grow up to be good, healthy individuals, regardless of race.  Not in America where race and race matters are so pervasive.  The editors forewords before each chapter, Janie Victoria Ward and Tracy L. Robinson among them were provacative, intelligent studies.  I would highly recommend this book to high school and college student of African descent as well as their parents and students of black sociology.  Very well done.ps?

I have followed Kevin Powell's career from the days on MTV's Real World to his stint as editor at VIBE magazine to his memoir &quot;Keeping it Real&quot;.  He has compiled here a magnificent volume of Gen X African American writers who are intelligent and thought provoking.  Where do I start? Well for one I have to disagree with the previous reviewer about Powell's anger.  I think the introduction was a prelude to the rest of the great writing.  Angry?  I think not.  He's just keeping it real.  That said, this book is not just Kevin Powell, though he does have a moving essay that I read a few years ago in VIBE- &quot;Live From Death Row&quot; which gives the background of the label of Tupac Shakur, among others.  There is other hip-hop journalism from Joan Morgan and Farai Chideya, two of my favorites.  Scott-Poulson-Bryant's view of Puff Daddy in &quot;This is Not a Puff Piece&quot; is illuminating.  I was thrilled with the essay section. Prolific writers such as Veronica Chambers torn between family and integrity with &quot;Mama's Girl&quot;, Lisa Jones exploring multiculturism with &quot;Are We Tiger Woods yet?&quot;, and Lonnae O'Neal Parker's revealing portrait in &quot;White Girl&quot;.  The criticism section has Erin Aubrey examing Ebonics/Black English in &quot;The Soul of Black Talk&quot;.  Poetry by Ruth Forman and Lenard D. Moore, among many others; fiction by Junot Diaz, a humorous, touching story, &quot;The Sun, the Moon, the Stars&quot;; Edwidge Danticat, Tannarive Due.  There is a Dialogue section as well.  The list of talent is endless; Paul Beatty, Danzy senna, Danyel Smith.

This is a great resource tool.  Throughout the book he stresses, &quot;Do your research and be prepared&quot;.  He certaintly did his research.  Some of the topics are the query, the proposal, copyright, and acquiring an agent.  He breaks down the question of race and publishing.  Should black writers use only black agents?  When do you play the race card? An absolute treat is in discussing the different genres of writing, he gives biographies of black writers of that particular genre and the notable writers of such. There is also a history of African American literature and insight to some well known and not so well known writers who made great contributions.  His research is impeccable. He also gives valuable information on forming a book club. This book should be in the library of every aspiring and published African American author because of its overall comprehensive approach to getting in print. Of course most of the information is valuable to any person regardless of color. We are a prolific people and are making an impact in every aspect of writing.  This book helps us to understand the hows, whys, dos and donts.	2001-01-13

I always purchase Beverly Jenkins' books when they are released and hold onto them until I have some relaxed uninterrupted time.  That time was over the Xmas holidays when I was on vacation.  It has been sunny here in the Bay Area and I wanted to get out in it but I had a hard time moving in the morning for two days straight because I was engrossed with this book. We met the protagonists Grace Atwood and Jackson Blake in &quot;Topaz&quot; another great book where we met Katherine and Dix Wildhorse.  Grace has commissioned Jackson to lead a caravan of mail-order brides from Chicago to Kansas where there is a new black settlement in 1884. Kate is a lady banker from the representative black community in Chicago.  Representative is what Dubois called the talented tenth.  We see here that after the Civil War that all blacks were not scruffling out a living ath the mercy of whites.  There were people like Grace who could trace their lineage for several generations and came from free people of color as well as slaves and who were well off economically.  Jackson came from Texas where he was raised by his preacher father from a meager background.  Jackson was a lawman and when his father was murdered by the Rebs he wanted to avenge his death only to be run out of Texas to save his life.  Now it has been ten years and he wants to go back and clear his name and now the hellion Grace his up in his face demanding he escort the brides.  They are both so stubborn and headstrong they butt heads at every end but their attraction is undeniable and fiery.  Although this is historical fiction, Jenkins weaves actual black historical events and characters into the storyline.  She tells about Jean Baptiste DuSable, a black Frenchmen, who discovered Chicago.  We hear about the Black Seminoles and a little of their history.  We meet Frederick L. Barnett, a black newspaperman who found the Conservator at a ball.  African American history is viewed here not only from a slavery prospective but shows the strides and gains blacks made before, during, and after the war.

When Zachary and Korie meet there is an immediate attraction and they act upon it.  However, as Eryka Badu's song goes, Korie is a bag lady.  She has been separated from her husband who she met at college.  Korie comes from an upper-class family in Jamaica and rebels against her parents when she marries Sam.  They drift apart and now are just friends.  But he is back in her life just as she and Zachary have built a solid relationship and he has left Philadelphia to live with her in New York.  Sam is gravely ill and Korie feels obligated to take care of him.  What she discovers about her husband sets in motion a series of events that changes the course of all three of their lives.  There is much pain and redemption in this story.  There is a secondary story of Zachary's family and the relationships in his family.  It is not until the end that we see how this seemingly unrelated events intersects with Zachary and Korie's story.  There are many scenes from the past in both Zachary and Korie's lives, scenes from their childhood and relationships with their parents.  This was a beautiful tale that resonates with you long after.  I look forward to more of this author's work.	2001-01-02

I had heard quite a bit about this book via-email advertisements and word of mouth. But I wasn't as enthused as most previous reviewers.  I had a hard time distinguising if this book was meant to be strictly comedy or drama and decided it was a comedy/drama. If that was the case, there were plenty of hilarious scenes, violent hilarious scenes.  While the characters were well-developed I found the dialogue to be stiff and at times exaggerated.  However this was a book that was meant to entertain and that it does.  I look forward to this author's future work.	2000-12-27

I  was taken back of the frame picture of on the place setting; a picture of women beautifully dressed in what was obviously 1800s attire and the man with her proudly wearing a Confederate uniform.  Immediately my hackles went up.  As an African American and very much interested in the debate going on about the Confederate flag, I was offended and my first mind was to just toss it in the trash. However, I later picked up the book and thumbed through and was I in for a treat.  Ms. Clairmont very tenderly and modestly describes her travels and entertwines how the beverage of tea has played an important part of her life.  This is a book filled with ancedotes and goodwill that any tea lover and Christian will love. She describes a goodwill campaign that I am thinking of instituting of which she suggests ladies when visiting someone such as a shut-in, they bring tea bags and teacups and other condiments and have an instant tea party.  The idea is to engage that person in soothing conversation while enjoying a cup of hot tea.  There are pictures from her album and stories of the interesting people in her life and of the blessings they bring. The recipes are wonderful especially the one for Devonshire cream that goes well with scones. This is a delightful little book and truly follows the rule that you cannot judge a book by it's cover.	2000-12-09

This book of essays is absolutely the best resource on the Creole heritage of Louisiana.  The history is priceless and my hat goes off to Dr. Kein for compiling such a group of scholars and historians who have covered every aspect of the subject. I have many books and have done much research since the late eighties as part of my research on African American history.  This book has been a long time in coming.  I thank Anthony Barthelemy for his essay &quot;Light, Bright, Damn Near White&quot; which answered my questions of the infamous Susie Guillory case, the woman who &quot;discovered&quot; she was considered &quot;Colored&quot; when she went to get a passport in the 80s.  I always wondered what they true story was and now I know. I enjoued learning about Marcus Chritian through violet Harrington Byan's essay exposing his research on Creoles.  All of the essays are worth reading and referring to again and again.  Composers of color of Nineteenth-Century New Orleans was an eye-opener.  I had heard about them but found very little information until this.  The essay by Joan Martin on placage answered alot of questions for me of why and will be helpful for my friend who is writing a thesis on Creole women and the institution of placage.  Oh, and Sybil Kein's &quot;The Use of Louisiana Creole in Southern Literature&quot; was worth the whole book.  This essay brought home full circle of my studies of some of the writers who have written about literature, race, and passing.  I could go on and on. Creole Poets, their professions and trades, the food connection.  It is all wonderful. I count this book as one of my best investments for 2000 with the wealth of knowledge in it.  This should be in the library of every American historian, black, white, or other.	2000-10-18

I was interested in this book when I read the reviews a few months ago.  And then it became a pick for my book club so I purchased it last month and read it straight through.<br />For an established author such as Ms. Due to take a historical subject and fictionalize it based on actual events is truly a gift and few writers are able to do it effectively. There has been some criticism for taking license with the truth but I feel the criticism is unfounded.  Oh well, there will always be detractors. This project was first started by the late Alex Haley.  But Ms. Due picked up the pieces and did Madame Walker justice.<br />From Madame C.J. Walkers' abject poverty and tragic childhood in Louisiana and Mississipi to her courageous move to St. Louis after her husband's tragic death to her search for a hair cure is truly a heroic story.  Madame Walker never let poverty or color stop her from working hard to achieve her goals.  Starting out as a laundress and showing that any job no matter how lowly could be done with dignity and pride makes me so proud of our brother and sisters who endured such harsh racism in the early part of the century.<br />Madame Walker built a laundry business and then distributed hair products and then discovered her own hair beauty secret that would eventually make her a very wealthy woman.  Her riches did not come without pain though.  Her second husband C.J. Walker helped her develop her business but he also brought her untold grief.  Her daughter A'lelia who was also in the business later came to be known as a partygoer and spendthrift.  I was surprised to learn Madame Walker died at such a young age, in her fifties.  I have always known about this magnificent woman and now I want to read more about her. Oh by the way, my book club will meet with the author for a Sunday brunch on the 8th.  I am looking forward to it.	2000-10-06

She felt as if she was being treated like she was the culprit.  She even wants to give up writing, something that she loves.  Along her way to finding herself she meets a pullman porter that tries to sweep her off her feet, a young white sister and brother fighting for civil rights, and the man, a journalist, that she eventually fall in love with.  But she does have to go back to Mississippi and make peace with her parents and the horror there.<br />Miss Foster lets us look into the hearts and minds of the evildoers.

She went after James because her friend wasn't right for him. Babysister took the fact that she saw her mother killed at four years old to justify being a spoiled brat.

I read an excerpt from this book about two or three years ago in Essence magazine.  I remember at the time I was curious about what kind of book Mr. Luttery could write about involving the regret and demise of an interracial relationship.  He went into the relationship willingly , right, so why the sob story?  Well, I see now that the excerpt didn't begin to tell the story.<br />The author very tenderly and methodically tells his story of entering into an interracial relationship with a young white woman.  He tells of the pain and guilt and miscommunication that led to this relationship coming out of a relationship with a black woman he deeply cared for.  He tells of the reluctance, the shame, the misgivings, but also of the deep feelings and satisfaction of this union.  Some reviewers have criticized the author as generalizing blacks and white women.  In his defense I will say that at the time he was involved with this young woman he was only twenty-three and twenty-four years old, not long out of college, beginning his manhood although he was very mature for his age.  He had goals in his personal and career lives and seemed to know what he wanted in a relationship.  However, I think because of his age that some of the anguish he went through may have been handled better had he been say about thirty years old. Going to purchase his first new car at twenty-three and all the drama that went with that was a turning point in his relationship.  That is not to take away from his anger or pain at finding out his love could not and did not want to share his pain.  The feelings are very real and perhaps too many interracial couples feel that because of the prolific nature of interracial relationships and the tolerance of such, that race is notan issue and needs not be addressed in the relationship.  The catch-all, &quot;but we're just people, I don't see color&quot; is like being the ostrich with his head in the sand. It has to be acknowleged and addressed.<br />This book is well-written with beautiful detail and word painting that gives a nonfiction work a novel approach.  But remember, this is one black man's story of his coming to grips of what an interracial relationship cost him and for him the price was too high.  To be able to express these feelings, looking into his inner self, to write and show the world his shortcomings and imperfections is to be applauded.  I love his writing and eagerly await his next work.k is well-written with beautiful detail and word painting that gives a nonfiction work a novel approach.

When Regina Harris meets Charles Whitfield, she is attracted to his good looks but turned off by his haughty, arrogant manner.

Like when she meets Charles' family and friends in Philadelphia.  When BAP Angela comes into the picture, she immediately feels threatened.  After all Angela comes from the right family and background.  How can she compete?  The characters were well developed and most scenes were very realistic.

I read a chapter every few days so to stretch  it out and savor it and make it last.  The stories are both enlightening  and encouraging.  There are well-known writers and not so well-known  writers giving their testimonies of how they found their place or voice in  the writing world.  From Ernest Gaines recounting of writing a book the  summer he was sixteen, first writing in long-hand and then pecking out on a  typewriter, and binding it and sending it to a publisher only to be sorely  rejected to Barbara Jean Fisher's story in the Overcoming Obstacles section  was a thrill.  Ms. Fisher overcame severe health problems to achieve her  dream of becoming published.  Elizabeth Engstrom talks of meeting her  favorite author and the invaluable advice she received.

He was  on one hand a supporter of Marcus Garvey and on the other hand felt the  need to put down the American black at every turn.  Her mother was a  submissive, silent woman who realized that her daughter was her husband's  son.  Jordan's memories of the people who made an impact on her life and  character, her Nanny, her Uncle Teddy, her camp friend, Jodi along with  tales of childhood death-defying accidents, academic excellence, and first  crushes are just bits and parts that serve to make this memoir a compelling  read.	2000-09-12

It will leave you in tears	This was a beautifully constructed  fable/love  story/inspirational/historical piece.  Miss Berry really put her heart and  soul into a story that will resonate with the reader for a long time.  Josephine (Fina) and Ross are brought together one morning in a book store.  This is just not any bookstore, but none other than Black Images, run by  Miss Cosina Brown, Ms. Cozy, if you please.  She is a wise soul who  posseses a book, a special rare book, that promises to change these three  main characters lives.  Anthropolist Ross and advertising exec Fina reach  for the book at the same time only to be told it isn't for sale.  That  settled, they sit down with Ms. Cozy and read the story written by a former  slave woman.  Little do they know how her story interconnects with them  all.  As the story weaves a heart wrenching story of the pain and hardships  of slavery and its legacy from the past to the present, the three  characters must examine their own lives and their future.  I like the fact  that the better part of this story took place in a book store.  This small  book packs a lot in its pages.	2000-08-31

I just  finished O is for Outlaw and as usual was entertained.  I was angry I had  to leave for work with three chapters left and rushed home to finish it.  This is classic Kinsey and I should know; I've read them all beginning with  A is for Alibi. I have actually had the book since January.  But I always  wait on these books and savor it for a time when I can devote my full  attention to it. Thrifty Kinsey Millhone pays twenty bucks (having bartered  down from thirty) for a locker of her past momentos left by her ex-husband  Mickey Magruder.  She walked out on him when she thought he asked her to be  his alibi for a murder he was accused of.  They were both cops at the time  and in her mind he had asked her to do the unthinkable.  A letter turns up  that gives Kinsey cause to think maybe she made a mistake about Mickey.  Then a visit from L.A. cops reveal that Mickey is laying in the UCLA  hospital, the victim of a gunshot.  The plot thickens.  You bet it does.  Sudenly there are a cast of suspicious acting characters and as the reader  you are left with the thought.  Now what is going on here?  A blonde  ponytailed bike rider, a former barmaid turned rich matron, bar owners who  may be involved in illegal activies.  All of this makes for a diverse cast  and rich mix of possibilities.  Leave it to Sue Grafton to weave the twists  and turns into an ending that will make you sigh and say, Now why didn't I  think of that?  When is P coming out?	2000-08-23

I applaud her  efforts.  The book was entertaining and kept my attention.  I found however  there were some missing pieces as others have mentioned.  The issue of  Imagany's incest past was not effectively dealt with as well as what  happened to her little sister.  That part left me hanging.  Although I  didn't like Imagany (She was shallow, materialistic, and self-absorbed)I  think the Ms. Williams did a good job of portraying a young woman who was  dealing with a lot of pain.  In contrast, her best friend Caprice seemed to  have it together. Am I wrong or did she zip through medical school? The  character of Elliott was a contrast of most young men who are college  athletes and seemed to have his head together.  He was actually too good to  be true.  I look forward to reading Robyn's next book, Twist of Fate.	2000-08-23

Lynn Harris hit number 2 last week on the New York Times Bestseller list.  His last two books, Abide with Me  and If This World Was Mine also were on the lists and in my opinion they  were better constructed books.  I am breaking my own rules in comparing  because I really think each book should be judged individually it it's own  merit.  I can't say anything bad about; It was indeed a page-turner.  If  there were halves I would give it a 3 1/2.  It just didn't quite warrant a  four.  Some reviewers have expressed disappointment and have given it low  ratings.  I think that is a bit much, but this last one did leave me  somewhat hanging, hungering for more.  I must admit I had doubts that a  union between the self-absorbed, psyche damaged, wannabe star Yancey and  the flip-flop, psychotic Mr. Basil could be successful.  They both are so  stuck on themselves and selfish but people change, right?  Basil with some  psychiatric treatment behind him feels he is in a position to love Yancey  Braxton and gives the relationship his all, resisting temptation with both  men and women.  Yancey loves Basil, but not completely which leaves room  for her to be influenced by her crazy, sluttish mother.  They have plans  for Yancey and Basil's wedding day and it doesn't look good.  With all the  superficial buppies, wannabe stars, and name dropping, my yearning for  living in New York has somewhat dimmed.  Imagine throwing a wedding and  inviting celebrities in order to boost your career and to get in the hot  publications. I am glad a brother is getting so much publicity and  attention for this novels and I recommend all of his books starting with  Invisible Life.  I also look forward to his memoir.	2000-08-14

I was on vacation so I started this book before I went to bed and got to  page 82 and finished the book by 3'oclock the next day.  It was definitely  a page turner.  Vincent and Dana could be characters that we know of could  have been ourselves.  Mr. Dickey manages to reach down and explore the  complexities of man/woman relationships with an insight that is no less  amazing.  If there ever was a case for being truthful when you meet that  special someone these two characters are good examples.  In the beginning  when it is so fresh, when the love is blossoming do we really want to know  about the other person's credit report or desire to know about that night  spent in jail eight years ago?  No, we want that person to fall in love and  then after they are hooked, spring the bad news on them.  Also, Dana and  Vince did not have closure from their past relationships.  Vince needed to  know why his wife cheated on him and her true feelings for him as well as  Dana needed to separate her gratitude to her ex-lover from his cheating,  manipulative character.  Oh, the mistakes and pitfalls we keep falling  into. If some of the past reviewers feel that Dickey's characters are  recycled then I say human beings keep recycling the same relationship  problems and the author is trying to tell us how many ways we keep making  the same mistakes.  I would recommended this book as one of his best.	2000-08-10

Van Whitfield intrigues us again with another humorous look at a brother who just can't quite get it together.  Like the main character in Beeperless Remote, Sonny is a nice guy, but..... When Sonny finds himself  blownup and dumped he joins a weight loss group in order to get his  girlfriend back but instead learns to look inside himself and get insight  into himself.  Along the way he meets a great girl and learns to love her  despite or inspite of her weight.  I applaud the author for drawing ead  characters, who are men as he is, who are far from perfect, sometimes  downright silly but show a softer side of men's feelings.  The issue of  weight is presented in a humorous but humane manner that will make us all  stop and think how we view people in a society that promotes thinness.  Even in the African American community where most overweight women's view  of themselves are healthier than that of white women, there are still  prejudices and expectations to live up to the perfect body image with all  the videos with bikini-clad rumpshakers.  This book will have you laughing  out loud.	2000-07-30
US	51210590	R1XSPDRXLTGU55	0374237573	299175300	Project Girl	Books	5	6	7	N	N	A most compelling read	I finished reading this book a few days ago and I am still feeling the after effects.  It took me longer than usual to complete this book because it left me feeling depressed so I would put it away for a day or two. It  seemed when the author took one step ahead, something would happen that  would put her two steps behind.  But I would get angry at her sometimes  because as her mother said she had book smarts and brains but no common  sense.  I don't know if the maginitude of her intelligence (she qualified  as a MENSA member) made it so she could not deal with mundane details.  But  I cannot blame the fact that she came from the projects for some of her  trials and tribulations.  As one previous reviewer said, Ms. McDonald had  more going for her than alot of kids from her circumstances, namely an  intact family with loving parents particularly a father who embraced  education.  How many kids from the ghetto could cut classes, use drugs, and  have run-ins with the law and still graduate from ivy league schools and  work for major law firms and fit in easily in Paris?  Not many, I would  think. But it would seem that she was doomed-- government set-ups, assault,  etc.  Some reviewers disparaged Gwendolyn Parker's &quot;Trespassing: My  Sojoun in the Halls of Privilege&quot; (See my review)for having a smooth  ride.  Her story as an upper-middle class black women traveling down the  some of the same roads as McDonald is a contrast but oh how similar.  They  both experienced racism in college and cooperate America. Though I was  often frustrated with the author (I wonder if living in Paris now has  vanished her guilt, anger, suicide, and homocidal urges) I gave this book  five stars because it deserved it for it's insightful journey and the  bravery the author has displayed that could have brought down Kennedy.	2000-07-30

Mr. Tervalon paints a look in slow motion in an almost surreal manner of life as it was in 1940s New Orleans.  The DuChamps  are by no means the perfect family but in fact the dysfunction among them  is the root of the story.  Some reviewers have criticized the switch from  first person to third, but this Faulkeneresque technique was most effective  in recalling the past in order to comprehend what is going on in the  present.  The author also does not shy away from the issues affecting  Creoles of Color in that era-- the ever present reality of living in two  worlds, chastised on one hand for &quot;looking white&quot; and looked down  upon for not being white.  He even shows Lita getting on a Jim Crow bus,  sitting in the white section, enjoying her sense of entitlement her  appearance affords enabling her to &quot;passe blanc&quot;.  At the same  time Lita expresses the great pride passed on to her in being proud of  being black.  For those who want to get a look into the life of the culture  of New Orleans this is a good read along with Robert Skinner's mystery  series which include &quot;Skin Deep, Blood Red&quot; and &quot;Cat-Eyed  Trouble&quot;.	2000-07-18

In his travels, Mr. Keenan interviewed blacks from various backgrounds.  It was definitely an eye opener for myself at the  great diversity.  The region of birth and circumstances of environment  determine how these blacks viewed themselves and their place in society.

Whether she is writing about alien life in &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; or giving history about African American life on a Montana ranch in &quot;For Keeps&quot;, Janice Sims manages to bring an excitement in romance with  nontraditional twists and turns.  She has done it again managing to develop  a romance and capture our hearts in Ballycastle, Ireland. Theodora  (Teddy)Riley, free lance journalist, is counting on obtaining an interview  with best selling novelist, Joachim West.  His last book won the National  Book Award but he steadfastly refuses any interviews, despising the press  afater the way his young wife's memory was tarnished during her funeral.  His best friend, Conal, an Irishman, has offered his home as a retreat so  that he can jump start his blocked writing.  The last thing he expected was  to come across the beautiful, alluring, Teddy. All Teddy wanted to do was  convince the reclusive Mr. West to give her an interview because she was  promised a permanent position with the magazine if she pulled this coupe.  She badly needs to obtain permanent position employment because it appears  her ex-husband wants to fight her for custody of their two-year old son.  Adrian Riley walked out on his pregnant wife and had nothing to do with his  son, Alex because it didn't fit into his game plan.  His broadcast career  was top priority and an unexpected child was not going to get in his way.  Now he is on Teddy's doorstep sparking a hostile reaction from her. A  mugging after she arrives in Ballycastle brings about a series of events  and Joachim ends up as Teddy's protector and because they are the only two  African Americans in town everyone assumes they are husband and wife.  What  a mess, but Joachim decides to keep up the charade because of the  connection he feels with Teddy. This was a well written story with a  picturesque view of the countryside of Ireland with colorful secondary  characters there and back at home in San Francisco.

Let me say that the criticism aimed at this memoir because of the author's often touted privilege is a little misplaced.  More often than not we are inudated with stories of African Americans who have overcome the worst odds  living in poverty-stricken, dysfunctional ghettos. These are truly American  stories and should be lauded.  However, African Americans do not all have  the same experiences and therefore have different views of growing up black  in America and life in general. There are class structures in the African  American communities as there are in other races.  There are privileged  Latinos and Asians as well as those who come from poor immigrant  backgrounds.  And so African Americans are not a monolith.  We don't all  have the same backgrounds and so we don't all think alike. Yes, it appeared  that for the most part Ms. Parker had a smooth ride for most of her life  but her priviledged background did not preclude her from racism.  From the  elementary school principal in the &quot;good ole' north&quot; who wanted  to hold her back a grade because she had up until then been educated in the  segregated south to the constant proving to others when she got to Harvard  that she did indeed belong there.  No, she did not have to overcome  feeling economically out of place as is pointed out in one of the reviews  that often blacks must overcome classism as well as racism.  Does that make  her any less black?  I think not.  When she got to the top law firm she  still had to deal with all the stuff that goes on in white corporate  America.  And just maybe her privilege was a disadvantage the same way a  deprived background was in that &quot;uppity black folk&quot; are  constantly told by their families their color is not an obstacle and they  can be and do anything as well as go anywhere they want.  When they come up  against racism it often shocks them to their knees or they choose to  disbelieve it causing even more distress. Indeed maybe this story was not  one of clawing her way to the top, but starting at the top, and sounds as  if she is whining and complaining because she dared face racism is only  evidence of her fraility.  The fact that she does not appear to some to be  sympathetic or helpful to those less privileged sisters and brothers is  something that only she has to answer to.  All in all this book like  &quot;Volunteer Slavery&quot; is an example of when it comes to racism  white folks look at us all the same way no matter how much money we have.  We have to always work harder to prove ourselves.

This book is not about passing for white as is Nella Larsen's masterpiece by the same name.  But that aside, the book stood alone.  I echo most of the other reviewers sentiment that this story shows how shallow and high-minded some black folk  can be. I wonder however if it was a tad bit exagerated.  There seems to be  a slew of books both fiction and nonfiction about the doings of the upper  middle-class blacks since Lawrence Graham's &quot;Our Kind of People&quot;  last year. It was a well-crafted story and the way the author tied the two  families together from the past took careful plotting.  This story didn't  end the way I thought it would but had a twist that took me by surprise.  I guess I felt sorry for Gil.  He was a nice guy and I wish Sandra had  broken it off with him gently before getting involved with Joseph.  Her  actions hurt Gil and gave reason for his mother to further acknowledge she  wasn't good enough. This story just proves that those who try the hardest  to be high society and look down on others the most are the most insecure  of people.  I was glad when Eulalie's past caught up with her.	2000-03-15

I definitely do not agree with the previous reviewer. This was not just a romance, but when I review a book I look for that something extra, what I can learn from this story; Is there a good plot? Are the characterizations  multilayered and realistic? Are they too perfect or are they real?  Does  the story explore a topic of interest and have interesting secondary  characters? Heart Of Stone has all of this and more. I myself am tired of  the run-of-the-mill romances that hooks up the rich guy and the poor girl  from the wrong side of the tracks or vice versa. Now read my review and see  if you don't want to  purchase it right here.<br />Sidney Cox thinks maybe she  is destined to be alone in this world.  Her parents are deceased and she is  not close to her older sister who lives in another state.  She has two  close friends, one right there in New York City.  It is in helping this  friend, Reva, out of a jame that she meets the man with voice. As a wine  sommelier, Sidney is part of an elite profession that not many women are a  part of, let alone an African American woman.  But Sidney is well prepared  for this profession having studied under the finest in the Napa Valley of  California and Italy.  It is during dinner one eveing at the restaurant  when she overheard the voice interpreting Italian for the waiter and  because her view was blocked she could not see who it was.  Now that voice  which belongs to Adam Coxc is demanding to know why she is drunk while  cleaning the offices where he is a security expert.  Waking from a deep  sleep, tired from working at her own job and then cleaning for Reva because  she has an acting job, things do look suspect with wine bottles strewn over  the table.  After Adam's rude reprimand she decides he is a cold person, a  man made of stone.  The next time she sees him is in the restaurnat and  there is no mistaking the sparks that fly. Adams begins to wonder if maybe  this is the woman who can melt the hardness around him.  Witnessing his  best friend's death has made him bitter, not to mention a killer is getting  closer.  Can he dare love Sydney and expose her to the inherent dangers of  his profession?  Is he ready to take a less dangerous position, if so?  this was a well-crafted story with romance and suspense aplenty.tnessing his  best friend's death has made him bitter, not to mention a killer is getting  closer.

I can't believe I have had this book since August and just read this past week!  The majority of the reviews I see agree with my opinion that this was a great book.  As for those few who disagree, well you can't please  everyone.  Mr. Channer has captured the culture of the thirty-somethings  of educated, middle-class people of African descent who live in the States,  Jamaica and London.  The characters were multi-dimensional and realistic.  Fire was a some kind of man and while I didn't always like Sylvia, I was  sympathetic to her character.  This book got to the root of how our past  and environment of our child affects what we carry over into our adulthood.  As to what makes this book different from the so called &quot;pop  fizz&quot; fiction and run-of-the-mill relationships stories is the depth  to which the characters are drawn and therefore entices the reader to think  intelligently about issues such as class structures among Blacks, moral  dilemnas, and friendships.  It even makes us think about the why of  relationships. Not to mention the sensual poetry.  The letter Fire wrote to  Sylvia from Jamaica was my favorite. I applaud Mr. Channer on this book and  look forward to more of his writing.	2000-01-13

The reviews thus far tell little of what this story is about.  Although I read it several years ago, as I remember this book, or at least a part of it, centered on the intra-racial divide between  those of African descent.  The Creoles of color, particularly in the region of the book, have long  maintained a somewhat separate status from blacks based on a caste system  determined by mixed blood and lineage.  The &quot;forgotten people&quot;  have maintained they have black blood, but emphasize their heritage also  include French, Spanish, and most times Native American blood.  Although a  great many Creoles eventually assimilated into the black community, during  the time of this story, (the 60s, I think) most of them kept a separate  status from blacks, thought they were subject to the most part to the same  Jim Crow laws and racism as blacks (unless of course, they chose to pass  for white- a whole other subject). When Jackson encounters Catherine, they  act upon an attraction they had from their school-age days. The  unwillingness of both families to accept is at the heart of the story.  That a group of people by virtual of the fact they have mixed blood (for  that matter, how many blacks are not mixed- whole other book)descended from  French planters deem themselves better or superior to others of more  distinct African blood and all the ignorance that prevails because of this  belief is what this is all about.  The reviews talk about Cajuns and indeed  this is Cajun country and the different cultures interact, but it is the  Creoles of Color that this book is about.  Mr. Gaines handles this with his  first-hand knowledge of growing up in Louisiana and all of its  idiosyncracies regarding race and class.  Though the book left me saddened,  I enjoyed the subject matter.	1999-05-13

This book had the potential of being a great resource book with the history of some of the accomplishments black folks have made against such great odds, especially during a time of Jim Crow and segregation.  However  the author misses the boat with all the talk of skin color and hair  texture.  He would have us believe that the brown paper bag test still  exists.  I for one don't believe it any self-respecting folk would subject  themselves to that kind of hogwash.  It is my understanding the many of  those he has labeled as &quot;elite&quot; take exception with that label.  Another thing is Mr. Graham's assuming attitude about the upper black class  seems to focus more on the East coast, as I understand that is where he is  from.  In California and the West coast, people are not hung up over class  differences.  The bottom line is people just want to raise their families,  focus on their education and career and live their lives.  We as a people  just cannot afford to look down our noses at those who are less educated  and economically depressed.  Our role is to help other black folk reach  their potential.  I am distressed by the personal attacks on Mr. Graham  especially about his wife.  This has no place in reviewing his book.  However I understand that alot of people were hurt and made to feel that  they hadn't achieved a certain status or they weren't good enough because  of superficial things like family background, where they went to school,  skin color, etcc.  Those of you who pulled yourself up from adverse  conditions, (growing up in projects, young welfare mothers, etc.), have  gone to college, acquired good jobs, and can afford some of the luxuries  Mrs. Graham espouses, have no reason to hang your head because you didn't  start at the top. On the same token, those who come from such distinguised,  prominent families should be proud of their heritage and accomplishments  and not made to feel they should not be.  Many of those &quot;Our Kind of  People&quot; are able to put it all in perspective without attitudes of  superiority. Again, the history was rich which is why I gave it a three,  but the author was not able to distance himself enough from the subject  without proving it was self-serving.ple&quot; are able to put it all in perspective without attitudes of  superiority.

Dallas Oliver, a thirty-year old writer, gets a call from her best friend since childhood,  Valerie, telling her a childhood neighbor has died and requesting she come  to funeral.  Dallas, who was assaulted by Nick Marco as a teen-ager, does  not want to attend his funeral.  Alex Marco, Nick's black sheep brother  saved Dallas from that horrifying experience when he intervened on her  behalf.  Dallas and her family were the only African-Americans in their  neighborhood and were subject to ridicue and acts of racial cruelty.  Dallas suffered ridicule of her own by virtue of having a white moters, who  was deceased, and a black father. She lived with her father, bother and a  hard-to-please step- mother.  Her former marriage and current relationship,  both with black men, left a lot to be desired.  She never could figure out  what these men wanted from her while all she wanted was to be loved for  herself.  When Dallas and Alex, now a Navy SEAL, become reacquainted at  Nick's funeral, all of tye memories of that period in her life are a  constant reminder of not only of the incident of which Dallas has nver told  Valerie, but also the adulation she has always had for Marco.  Dallas  considers Nick's mother, Lillian as a friend b ecause she befriended her  when her son and others isolated her for being black.  It appears that not  only do Dallas and Marco share a secret from the past that binds them, but  that Valerie also has a secret that she feels only Marco can assist her  with.  Marco is attracted to Valerie while at the same time is drawn to  Dallas.  Both women are attracted to him, Valerie throwing herself at him  while Dallas is trying to fight the attraction.  Soon the tension between  the best friends become strained and affects the relationship Dallas has  with Valerie's daughter, Megan, who is her goddaughter.  Dallas and Alex  come to realize that they mean a great deal to one another but along the  way must contend with an interracial relationship, a philandering  boyfriend, and guilt.  Ms. Kitt is well know for dealing with interracial  relationsips as she did in &quot;Color of Love&quot; and &quot;Significant  Others&quot; and has a style of writing that keeps one's interest.  However, this reviewer found it disturbing that the black men featured in  this story were either dogs or cowards.o realize that they mean a great deal to one another but along the  way must contend with an interracial relationship, a philandering  boyfriend, and guilt.

This book really broke down the racial dilemna in Louisiana which probably  more than in any other state of the union confronts the race question.  Who  and what you are seems to pervade this state of mixed- race people.  It  would seem you have to prove you are white by genealogy, no less.

Some of the negative comments from previous reviewers were  downright petty and often malicious.  Because the mother left her Jewish  religion and became a Christian means the book is anti-semitic.  I don't  think so.  This was just one woman's story and the son who so lovingly  portrayed her.  And well that he should expound on his siblings  accomplishments.  It is because of the mother's determination and the  emphasis she put on education that her children were able to achieve so  greatly.

The characters acted like giddy junior high schoolers and the diaglogue was unbelievable.  I under stand Ms. Wright writes children's books and has won numerous awards.

This book is more than just a love tory, but a lesson in history, a glimpse into a society not discussed in high school history books because so little is known about it.  Set in pre-civil war new orleans, the story is cented around a young woman of color, in this case, a quadroon, three-quarter white, one-quarter black and the legacy into which she was born.  From the day she was born, Sylvia Dupont is detined to become a mistress to a rich Creole (the definition of Creole is ambiguous, in this case it is an American born of French or Spanish parentage)planter. She is primed, and educated to this end, as she herself is a result of a placquee (an agremment set up between a white man and a woman of color). She is taught the ways to seduce a man of means and keep him interested enough to make a cvontract that will promise her a lavish home, expensive furnishing, clothes, and support and education for the children that will result from their union.  Adrien Valcour is such a suitor and Sylvias's mother, Celeste relaizez all of her hopes and ambitions will be realized when a contract is made between her daughter and Monsieur Valcour.  Celeste, a mulatto (half-wife/black) is still bitter over the abandonment of her &quot;protector&quot;, Sylvia's father when her children were young.  The snag in the plan is Justin Reynaud, a wealthy free man of color, who meets Sylvia on a boat returning from France. Sylvia is returning after four years of education in the arts and becoming a lady, while Justin is returning from a business trip.  Sparks fly, but Sylvia knows that she cannot entertain the idea of becoming involved with a man of African descent even though it has been her dream as a child to marry and be a wife.  Her destiny is to become a mistress, not a wife.  Justin believes that the quadroon ball and placquees are just another form of slavery since there is a law forbidding marriage between white and blacks.  Besides most of these men le! ave their mistresses after they marry a woman of their own color, leaving the children without a father and sometimes without support.  Justin belongs to a class of free blacks that own ladn, are skilled artisans and well educated, often in France.  Most of them scorn the system that prostitutes their women.  Sylvia and Justin's paths cross again when his aunt, Mademoiselle Angelique is asked by Sylvia's mother to Sylvia how to &quot;keep a house&quot;. Justin is always around upsetting Sylvia's emotional state of mind.  Soon they are caught up in their feelings for one another and just when they are about to consummate the relationship, Justin declares he will not take her unless they marry. Sylvia dare to defy traditon, plan a wedding with  Angelique's help and the support of some black nuns.  Sylvia marries Justin and is disowned by her mother.  Their happiness is troubled with her brother's gambling debts and double life, their conflicting views on loyalty, old girlfriends and a scorned suitor.  There is a flood, a kidnapping and death as their marriage is tried again and again.  This was a very interesting book, rich with scenery of both New Orleans and Cane River, today still the home of today's black Creoles.  It is also unsettling.  There were blacks who owned slaves as well as those who viewed themselves better than other blacks because of the mixture of white blood in their veins.  But we must realize that prople of color were were as much a victim of their circumstances as during this time in history just as their white counterparts were.cks.

At first, I didn't understand the turmoil and angst one goes through who is bi-racial.  The bir-racial people I always knew classified themselves as black and most of them did not appear to have a problem with that.  Most of them had white mothers who raised them but they didn't consider themselves as denying their white heritage.  Society including blacks see them as being black because it is so hard sometimes in distinguishing a bi-racial from a black person with two black parents.  Oftentimes a full-blooded black looks more white than a bi-racial. Also a lot of it is all you have been raised, how the parents involved feel about race.  Anyway the author does thorough interviews regarding this issue.	1998-07-07

This was indeed an eye-opener and though I found it hard to swallow the fact that blacks were enslavers themselves, this novel helped me put it all in perspective.  I know many people of creole descent, but very little was ever discussed regarding their heritage other than speaking of family members that they know that have passed for white and assimilated into the white race.  It could be many of them especially the younger ones know very little of their history and the part they played in literature, the arts, and craftsmanship.
