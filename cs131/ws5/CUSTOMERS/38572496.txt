I felt cheated from page one. There is a lack of planning in this book and the author just trails off into never never land at times. The book needs a good editor. What is so disturning about the book is that it throws in your face how rich the author is without remorse. Over and over again you hear how great the writer is and he makes you feel like you are not worth much. I felt bad after reading this ego-trip of a book with its look-at-me message and its condesending tone.	2003-05-29

There is really no rhyme or reason to the text and the reader is left wondering at times what exactly the author is talking about. Also, there is no proof given in the book for the author's success. He claims he is rich, but the reader would not know this just by reading the book. Because of this I had doubts about many of the author's claims in the book. There is a dark cloud of uncertainty surrounding the work that leads me to think that some sections of the book are pure make believe. This would be a better book for fiction or fantasy than non-fiction.	2003-05-29

All there is really are just stories and thoughts from Marc Allen. Mr. Allen says that he is not a Type A personality, but a Type Z. In other words he admits he is a lazy person and says that he has his employees do most, if not all of the work for his company. Show me a millionaire who thinks like this and I will show you a millionaire that will not be a millionaire for long. Most successful business people are actively involved in their businesses and know what the meaning of the word work is.

But what blew me away was what I read in the acknowledgements. Mr. Levitt, a former stockbroker, credits Warren Buffett with informing him about the core of broker comepensation and mutual funds compensation. Gee, didn't Mr.Levitt know the core of these issues when he was at the SEC? It just strikes me funny that a long time vetern of the securities industry would tip his hat to Buffett on such basic issues. Outside of this the book is a gathering of books that combines the worst in biography, advice and expose. Mr. Levitt admits that his poweres were limited by Senators like Phil Gramm, but his book is also limited with few insights worth paying for.

The behind-the-scenes material is interesting, but it is so weighted in the author's favor that it lacks a sincere element of truth. Instead of writing a book about what investors don't know about Wall Street, I wish Arthur Levitt would have spilled the beans while he was the SEC's chairman. To make money by writing a book based on what he should have told investors long ago does not sit well with me.

It is a real shame that he worked at taxpayers expense, yet at times  he did little to help average investors. Regulation FD, whihc he lauds in the book has made corporate reporting just a marketing tool and while it is true that Levitt complained about auditors--that is all he did--since no legislation took place while he was SEC chariman to remedy their conflicts. Only now are research analysts being investigated and auditors being treated with a critical eye. The problems with stock brokers he details are pretty much on the mark, but during his tenure he did nothing to stop sales contests held at brokerage firms that compromise the interests of investors. He also talks some about the problems with IPOS, but during his tenure he did nothing to stop brokerage firms from treating small investors differently than large ones. The entire book makes Levitt look like he is giving readers something new and fresh, but most of the information has been detailed before in books published years ago. Levitt toots his own horn in trying to sell his book, but if he had a louder voice when he was SEC chairman many investors would have saved a lot of money.	2002-10-08

For example, when he says that 60% of Americans have never read a book and only 6 % read as much as one book or more per year my jaw suddenly dropped. The book business is a rather small business when you really think about it. Moreover, the author says America has around 290 million people, but 120 million of them are funtionally illiterate. Hahahah Good grief Charlie Brown. But I have to say that when Berman reports that 12% of Americans named Joan of Arc as Noah's wife I just could not stop laughing. What does this mean? For one, it means publishers are in BIG trouble. If kids today don't read for pleasure where will tomorrow's readers come from? Berman is right publishers only like to publish what makes money and sells well, so future authors unite and be sure to write about new age or get to know a celebrity fast. The death of the printed word is almost certain, especially with the advent of HDTV, high band-width computer games and the like. Yes, Berman is right America is declining at a rapid pace.	2002-05-24

I wish when publishers thought up books like this that they would consider stories unlike the ones in this book. Stories of average people who have made it. Let's face it, most book lovers are not millionaires and it would be nice to know something about people who are not rich and famous who have been successfull. This is the same old stuff.	2002-05-06

It does not live up to its expectations and after reading this boring, trite, &quot;already-published&quot; book I wanted my money back.	2002-05-06

He misses poverty, the class system and about a billion other problems that would be of interest to a savvy reader. Give us all a break!	2002-04-26

This tome is 400 pages and the idea expressed in the book is that some words spoken to a person long ago have made that person what they are today. This is really ridiculous. There are some parts that are rather funny though. For example, Stephen Ambrose says that the words that meant the most to him were &quot;never judge a man by his motives.&quot; Doris Kearn Goodwin is also in the book and given recent headlines about the two of them it seems that readers should judge at least some people by their motives. Other people in the book have also fallen from grace and to use their words as an inspiration seems silly and downright stupid to me!	2002-04-26

Books	1	4	16	N	N	Long on Marketing Short on Substance	The book says that the heart and soul of business is thinking and this is nothing but hogwash! Action makes business not philosophers, deep thinkers or wise old men. There are lots of thinking problems in the book and page after page is concerned with thinking matters. Tell me, did Bill Gates think about Windows or did he go out and sell something? Action not thinking about it is going to make your business. Planning is good and I hope the authors plan to do a much better book next time.	2002-04-25

I guess it is nice to laugh your way through an illness, but if you have ever had cancer you will know that it is not funny. The problem with the book is you can't make light of some things (cancer being one of them) and if the author had a better understanding of what people go through when they lose a loved one to cancer I think she would have written another book.	2002-04-25
