US	52590451	R2P4AUZRPTCFF1	0743253396	760100886	House of Bush, House of Saud: The Secret Relationship Between the World's Two Most Powerful Dynasties	Books	1	20	52	N	Y	Disorganized and fairly partisan review of Bush Middle East policies	_House of Bush, House of Saud_ by Craig Unger is one of a recent series of books on the United States-Saudi Arabia relationship (or otherwise dealing with American activities in the region), and like several of those works is critical of the Bush administration. The central tenet of this book is that the \\"secret relationship\\" between the House of Saud and what Unger termed the \\"House of Bush\\" (both Bush presidents as well as a number of close associates such as James Baker, Donald Rumsfeld, and Dick Cheney) helped to create the current age of terror we are now living in and lead to the horrible events of 9/11; that American (in this book, Bush and friends) interests in Saudi Arabia precluded any intensive investigation of Saudi roles and involvement in terrorist acts and quite remarkably that George W. Bush owed his 2000 election to the mobilization of Saudi-funded Islamic groups. In the course of the book Unger also found the space to show how the House of Bush was instrumental in the rise of Saddam Hussein, downplaying the unsavory qualities of Hussein during the Reagan years and the Iran-Iraq War, the instigation of the 1991 Gulf War, and misleading the world about the real nature of the threat posed by Iraq both as a result of the 1990 invasion of Kuwait and prior to the second Gulf War.  <br /> <br /> Quite extraordinary claims, and significant ones, as this book was one of those apparently cited by Michael Moore in his controversial documentary _Fahrenheit 9/11_. Does Unger prove them? In a word, no.  <br /> <br /> First of all, I think Unger tried to tackle too much. His narrative is all over the place, trying to cover a great deal of history, from the early days of Saudi involvement in Texas businesses and development of Saudi oil resources to the internal divisions within the Reagan administration and the secret deals during the Iran-Iraq War to the history of the neocons to some of the minutia of the 2000 presidential election to the invents leading up tothe second Iraq War.  As much as Unger would like to think that all of this was very closely related - and in truth, as they all involve more or less the same region, there was some relationship - they were not as closely tied together as he would like the reader to believe. Some important points he made about the \\"House of Bush's\\" or the Saudi's complicity one some matter or another only got a page or two or even a few paragraphs before he rushed on to the next issue. While some of the background history was actually quite interesting - I will admit I didn't know much about the Iran-Iraq War for instance - a good amount I think had little to do with the case he was trying to make.  <br /> <br /> I don't have the space to review every point Unger made in his book. Some of his criticisms have been well answered elsewhere. That the Americans (with Saudi and Pakistan help) inadvertently created Al-Qaeda by supporting the Afghan Arabs and other insurgents in the Soviet War in Afghanistan I think is not in dispute, and the case has been made, even to an extent in this very book, that the war was a major if the major cause for the collapse of the Soviet Union. Supporting Hussein during the Iran-Iraq War, overlooking his use of chemical weapons, and his build-up of huge conventional forces has been criticized before, but again I don't think it had anything to do with Saudi Arabia for instance (or only marginally) and wasn't done out of any profit-making motive or for naked political power on the part of any member of the \\"House of Bush\\" (and George W. Bush had absolutely nothing to do with this at any rate). In hindsight American support for Hussein was quite regrettable, but again, that is hindsight. At the time there was a greater fear of Iran and its possible export of a Shiite revolution.  <br /> <br /> Two issues that Unger focused a lot of attention on were admittedly interesting but again I don't think he made the point strongly enough that there was any real wrongdoing. He noted the well known fact that Bush won in 2000 by the slimmest of margins in Florida and that Bush actively courted the Arab-American and Muslim-American vote in Florida (and in other states, notably Michigan). While studies showed that anywhere from 88% to 91% of Muslims in Florida voted for Bush and no doubt this was a factor, who is to say that this was the decisive factor in winning Florida? Anyone can pick out any one interest group that voted for Bush and say that they were the factor. <br /> <br /> Unger also noted that several fund-raisers and campaigners in Florida had ties to terrorism, such as Sami Al-Arian, a Kuwait-born Palestinian who was a professor at the University of South Florida, later shown to have ties to Islamic Jihad, a Palestinian terrorist group, but then later noted that \\"Bush could not have known at the time\\" that a case was being built up against him and others (as well as noting the Democrat's complete absence of criticism of their involvement at the time). While certainly a few of the Muslim and Arab campaigners in Florida had such ties, Unger did not make a very strong case that Bush knew this or was complicit in this.  <br /> <br /> Unger opened and closed the book with criticism of the flight of a number of Saudi nationals and their associates out of the United States days after 9/11, when American airspace was still closed to private planes, both for the administration for allowing them to leave starting on September 13 and for their lax questioning by officials. That was probably his strongest and most interesting criticism of Bush, though the chronology he provided indicated it might have been the case of bureaucratic bungling, not some sinister conspiracy with a foreign power.  <br />	2005-10-05
US	52590451	R3JM0FRWFG2TB8	0375700463	116719555	Intelligence in War: The value--and limitations--of what the military can learn about the enemy	Books	5	13	15	N	N	Fantastic and engrossing study of military intelligence	_Intelligence in War_ by John Keegan asks a basic question; just how useful is intelligence in warfare? There is he wrote a great deal of literature that seems to suggest that it is of enormous importance but Keegan sought to show exactly just useful it really is. <br /> <br /> First, Keegan defined intelligence. There are five fundamental stages in intelligence practice, the first being acquisition. While the data gathered may include published and publicly available information, generally information that is useful in a military situation is gathered through clandestine means, the main types being spying with human agents (human intelligence or humint), the interception of an enemy's communications, a method generally requiring decryption (signal intelligence or signit, the main type of intelligence discussed in the book), and visual imaging or surveillance, through aerial photography provided by aircraft and satellites. Throughout the book Keegan discussed the pros and cons of each type of intelligence and their relative importance over the years. Second, there is delivery (something nontrivial especially for the transmitter of humint). A major problem for centuries was the difficulty in sending collected intelligence to a potential user in a timely fashion, in \\"real time\\" (a major problem before the telegraph). The third stage is acceptance of the gathered intelligence, of either accepting the source or believing instead that the information is wrong or in fact is an example of enemy counter-espionage. The fourth stage is interpretation, the art and science of weaving together a picture from the many scraps collected to produce a useful picture of an enemy's capabilities and intentions. Finally is implementation of this intelligence.  <br /> <br /> The bulk of the book is a collection of case studies, examples that Keegan took from history to illustrate various points about the collection and use of intelligence and how these points are still applicable to the modern policymaker. He began in the age of sail, when the main difficulty in the intelligence field was in the struggle to acquire useful information and deliver it to intelligence officers at such a speed so it wouldn't be out of date, and ended near the present, when there is such a vast wealth of information of all sorts - \\"frustratingly rich\\" as Keegan put it - that the volume threatens to overwhelm the minds of those seeking to evaluate its worth.  <br /> <br /> The cases Keegan chose were extremely interesting and very well-told stories, ranging from Admiral Nelson's chase of Napoleon's fleet in 1798 that culminated in the Battle of the Nile to the use of intelligence in the 1982 Falkland Islands War, each case study well illustrated with photographs and excellent maps. Though each case study could simply be read as a detailed and well-written historical account, they also served to illustrate various points Keegan was making about intelligence in war.  <br /> <br />For instance, the German airborne assault of Crete in May 1941 vividly showed that even the best intelligence in the world is no good if the defense is unable or unwilling to profit from it. Despite nearly real time intelligence provided to the commander of Allied forces on the ground in Crete, including the timing of the attack, the objectives, and the strength and the composition of the attacking force, the Germans won the day. The Germans won by a combination of extreme nearly berserker recklessness on their part and the belief of the local Allied commander that he could successfully retire, regroup, and counterattack after a bit of rest at one part in the battle, leaving a small opening that the Germans were able to exploit, something that they should have not been able to do. This illustrated two points that Keegan made several times in the book; one, that no matter how good the intelligence, that given equality of force, the outcome will still be decided by the fight, and that in a fight, again given equality of force, the outcome will be the result of determination.  <br /> <br />The Battle of the Atlantic - the struggle with the U-boats in World War II - has long been cited as an example of the victory of intelligence use, but Keegan showed that while intelligence was very important, one should not overlook the parallel importance of non-intelligence factors. Though Bletchley Park has been lauded for its ability to break Enigma and route convoys around U-boat wolfpacks and patrol lines, other factors played as big or a bigger role in an Allied victory, including an increase in the size of the merchant fleet, vast improvements in the technology to detect and destroy U-boats, improvement in the capabilities and numbers of escorts, and the advent of escort carriers.  <br /> <br />  The British coming to terms with the German V-Weapon program illustrated the importance of interpretation and the pitfalls of photographic intelligence. Despite a number of over flights of Peenemnde - the test center for the V-weapons - and ample photographic surveys and despite humint pointing to radical new weapons programs being developed there, the British were slow to understand what was going on at Peenemnde chiefly because the British intelligence apparatus lacked any practical knowledge of either rocket or cruise missile technology and did not know what to look for nor realize what they had in fact seen. In truth the aerial surveys had photographed equipment related to the V-weapons as well as the V-weapons themselves but the intelligence officers did not know what they were looking at and/or dismissed it, with such policymakers as Lord Cherwell insisting that any German rocket be a huge, slow-speed, solid-fueled, multi-stage rocket requiring a huge launch tower, rather than looking for or accepting the existence of a smaller, high-speed, liquid-fueled weapon requiring only a very small launch apparatus.  <br /> <br /> So what did Keegan conclude? Intelligence is important in war, there is no doubt, but good intelligence does not \\"unerringly point the path to victory;\\" that while it is necessary, it is not sufficient to ensure success. Willpower often counts for more in warfare, intelligence only being useful when there is the strength and the will to use it.  <br />	2005-09-28

Munro is a relatively brief (at 221 pages) but thorough assessment of the possible threat of and (to a lesser extent) the possible solutions to an emerging China in the early years of the 21st century. While not condemning China in any manner I would describe as hateful or racist and indeed acknowledging that there is a distinct possibility China may one day grow more democratic and develop close ties to the United States in the future, the authors contended that American policy makers need to be aware of the real threat to American vital interests posed by the Chinese, the disparity between stated Chinese goals and actual Chinese policy, and the ineffectiveness if not downright naivety of past American policy dating from the late 1980s, when China and the United States no longer had the Soviet Union as a common enemy and thus no longer had much in the way of common ground on strategic issues. Chinese policy has changed markedly since then thanks to events beginning in the late 1980s, notably with the brutal crackdown of the Tiananmen Square student occupation in 1989 (the Chinese saw this and other actions as a real threat to their Communist Party), the consequences of Mikhail Gorbachev's political reforms (which the Chinese interpreted as diluting the Soviet Communist Party's power and leading to their ousting), and the 1991 Gulf War (a display of very advanced military technology and planning that stunned the Chinese, showing to them how far behind the Americans they were and technology they would have to begin to master in order to achieve territorial goals in the South China Sea and any possible future military actions against Taiwan).  <br /> <br /> The leadership in China has been working towards a goal of domination over Asia by a four-pronged strategy. First, and foremost, to gain sovereignty and control over Taiwan (the authors described in detail the Chinese naval, air, and army build up inthe last decade or so), second, to expand Chinese military presence in and take control of the South China Sea (in large part by annexing small islands and island groups such as the Spratly Islands and Mischief Reef, illustrated in a map in the front of the book), third, to reduce the American military presence in East Asia (particularly if possible on the Korean peninsula, done by encouraging the collapse of North Korea and the reunification of the peninsula under South Korea, ending the need for a large American military presence there), and third, paradoxically, to maintain a high American troop presence in Japan to keep it from rearming and becoming more assertive in international affairs. The latter point is one the authors stressed several times, as the growing power of China will require a more powerful, skilled, and assertive Japanese military, as the Americans alone cannot hope to counterbalance China, to keep Taiwan safe and free, and to keep the sea lanes open (in the face of Chinese dominance in the South China Sea and any possible future actions in the waters around Taiwan such a blockade).   <br /> <br /> In addition to being on the road to becoming a hostile hegemon in Asia - a direct threat to American vital interests, as such a hegemon could coerce American allies, threaten vital trade routes and sea lanes, and counteract or otherwise threaten American military deployments in the region - China is already an economic threat to American economic interests and furthermore is using its unfair trade practices to aid it in its military buildup by amassing large foreign cash reserves and acquiring advanced technology by coercion, deception, theft, or simply strong arm tactics (additionally many companies that do business in the United States are actually owned or are subsidiaries of the People's Liberation Army). China has been added in this endeavor by something the authors called the New China Lobby, a loose organization of businesses, investors, and economic advisors that have a large financial stake in China; eager to do business there, they either follow direct Chinese suggestions and orders or act in ways they generally believe Beijing will like in order to curtail or abolish American policy designed to end Chinese tariff and non-tariff barriers (as well as any linking of economic and regulatory benefits such as Most Favored Nation Status to human right issues within China), and by companies based in our European allies, who China turns to from time to time to punish some American firm for failing to hand over high tech or proprietary technology or for Washington for passing some legislation or making a statement that Beijing disagreed with.  <br /> <br /> Bernstein and Munro stated that the U.S. should have three goals with regards to China, namely to ensure peace in Asia by maintaining a stable balance of power there, to encourage China to become a responsible state committed to non-proliferation, peaceful resolution of disputes, and honest free trade, and third, to induce China to become more democratic and respectful of human rights. To achieve those goals they suggest that Washington push for a 5% annual reduction in the trade-deficit ratio, fully and loudly support all international forums to decry Chinese human rights abuses, and be \\"cool and correct\\" but not lavish and celebratory in Chinese-American diplomatic relations (summits should not be \\"occasions for tyrants to bask in glory\\"). Americans should be realistic about Tibet, as while there is virtually no chance that it will become an independent country and too much \\"sentimental nonsense\\" has been written about some idyllic Tibetan past, Washington should nonetheless maintain a respectful and public relationship with those who represent Tibetan cultural and religious aspirations and as with human rights issues in general unapologetically point out Chinese excesses in that area. Additionally, America should seek to maintain the technological edge it has over China, deter Chinese nuclear buildups, maintain Taiwanese defenses as a credible deterrent, and to encourage and strengthen Japan militarily and politically, ending its internationally abnormal military weakness and \\"diplomatic pariah-hood.\\"  <br />	2005-09-18

After Death	Books	3	3	4	N	N	A tale more horror than science fiction	_Dead Lines_ is a bit of a departure for Greg Bear, not at all like his better known works such as _Eon_, _Queen of Angels_, and _Hammer of God_. Though it seems to be usually labeled as science fiction in bookstores I am not sure I would call it that, as it is more akin to horror or even fantasy, in many ways the tone broadly similar to the (much superior) earlier work of his, _Songs of Earth and Power_, which was an excellent modern fantasy and one I highly recommend.  <br /> <br /> The main character of the book is Peter Russell, once a noted sexploitation director in the 1960s, 1970s, and early to mid 1980s along the lines of Russ Meyer. The hard core porn industry and personal problems other than that forced him out of the B-movie business and for the last few years he had instead been the friend and go-to errand guy for an eccentric, wealthy, married couple, Joseph and Michelle Benoliel. Peter was a recovering alcoholic, the alcoholism brought upon by his grief over the murder of one of his twin daughters and his subsequent divorce.  <br /> <br /> Things seemed to be looking for Peter as an entrepreneur approached him with a device that was going to revolutionize telecommunications. This company had developed a hand-held cell phone-like device called a Trans, one that had startlingly clarity of voice transmission and unlimited range on Earth, no matter if one was underground, in the air, or even they said on the Moon. Given a number of devices to hand out to friends and family members to promote the new product, Peter was excited, hoping to make a better living, even get back into directing a little as the company wanted commercials made to promote the new product.  <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the inventor of the device, Arpad Kreisler, had tapped into something he didn't understand. Arpad found a new source of bandwith that unlike what was used for cell phones and the like was not true radiation and had an infinite capacity to send unlimited amounts of information without any degradation due to distance. <br /> <br />To put it in a nutshell, this new realm that he found, one that had not previously been explored or accessed, is what appeared to be the realm of the dead, more or less, the place where spirits (souls?) go but also a repository for imagery and thoughts of living people in addition to the dead.  The Trans units somehow both blocked the natural degradation of spirits and memories of living people (particularly strong memories like grief) that are associated with a certain place and at the same time made them visible to those within a certain distance of a Trans unit (and particularly those with some connection to the phantoms and ghosts that they saw).  <br /> <br />When Peter started seeing ghostly images of living people, of actions that they had performed in the past, as well as odd shadowy creatures that he thought at first might be the trick of the light and of the eye, he thought he was going crazy. It wasn't long though before he realized that they were real and may in fact be a consequence of the Trans units and their use. Others soon started seeing the ghosts as well.  <br /> <br />The remainder of the novel dealt with Peter's interactions with the ghost of his dead daughter, Daniella, and discovering and confronting her killer, his coming to terms with his living daughter Lindsey and his ex-wife Helen, and stopping the Trans units from causing any more damage. <br /> <br />I am not entirely sure what to think of the book. It wasn't particularly scary. There was some mildly creepy imagery but nothing truly scary, though I haven't read a lot of horror and I don't know if a book can be as scary - at least to me - as a movie can. I know some reviewers have had trouble with Peter as the protagonist, though I found him sympathetic enough and in the end he was heroic. I thought that the author could have explored the effects of the Trans a bit more, perhaps shown what they effect they had outside the citywhere the main characters lived, but not sure if that would be possible given how the book was set up. Some of the ecology of the realm of the dead was mildly interesting though not particularly well explored either. I thought the entrepreneurs, particularly the businessmen (as opposed to the inventor) were a bit unbelievable; they had their start-up based in a prison the state of California was no longer using, were proud to have their main Trans servers (or whatever they were called) located in the gas chamber, and wanted to feature the prison in commercials made to promote Trans. I just have a hard time picturing anyone doing that and found that a bit unbelievable. I also thought that the inventor, Arpad, could and should have played a bigger role, though in the end the book seemed as much the story of Peter and his life as it was about the ghosts that the Trans had brought forth into the mortal world.  <br />	2005-09-12
US	52590451	R21WDFXGKA5AMI	0812580311	370216473	Dark as Day (Cold As Ice)	Books	5	3	4	N	Y	Excellent and highly entertaining hard science fiction novel	_Dark As Day_ by Charles Sheffield is the third and final volume of his (I believe) unnamed trilogy that began with _Cold As Ice_ and continued with _The Ganymede Club_. An excellent end to a very enjoyable series, the trilogy is only rather loosely connected, united mainly in the setting, which in a manner similar to a series of novels by Ben Bova - in the setting that includes the novels _Mars_, _Saturn_, _Venus_, and _Jupiter_  among others- is set in a future in which humanity is spread throughout the solar system but has not yet traveled beyond it, though humanity is more entrenched and numerous among the various bodies in our solar system than in Bova's series, with millions of humans living on Mars, Ganymede, and Callisto as well as scattered throughout the asteroid belt (a.k.a. the Belt) and in various satellites of Saturn.  <br /> <br />Aside from the fact that each later novel takes places further along the history of that universe than the novel that proceeded it, there is one common character, a major one, in these books, an individual by the name of Rustum Battachariya (also known simply as Bat), one of the most colorful, interesting, and distinct characters I have ever read in any science fiction novel. He is a reclusive individual, one mainly interested in profoundly difficult mathematical problems he solved for fun as part of a organization called the Puzzle Network and in collecting relics of the Great War, a massive conflict about thirty years ago that was system wide, fought on Earth, Mars, and the Belt and one that killed billions.  <br /> <br />As in the previous two novels, despite his dislike for publicity (except within the confines of the Puzzle Network) and for spending any quality, face-to-face time with any human being in the flesh, Bat was an integral character in solving the main problem in the book. In this case the problem is a multipart one, one that ended up somehow involving such diverse threads as the opening up of a very powerfulsystem-wide internet of sorts called the Seine, the bizarre results from a highly sophisticated predictive model designed by one Alex Ligon, one that showed humanity going extinct within a century, the Bat's efforts to track down a major weapons designer that went missing during the Great War, the weird mental abilities of a boy from Earth, Sebastian Birch, who had bizarre and apparently non-reactive microscopic objects in his body and had the almost idiot savant talent of predicting weather patterns on distant planets with little data, intrigue within Alex's family, the Ligon family, in trying to gain a lease on a small moon named Pandora (one leased by the very reclusive Bat), and the apparent discovery of extraterrestrial signals by Milly Wu, working at one of two competing SETI facilities near Jupiter. There is a lot going on but the plots do tie together very well in the end and make for a very compelling book. Sheffield did a fantastic job with this novel, the characters are extremely well drawn and very distinct, the science in this science fiction seemed top notch, and it is just a great story. I think that definitely it is the best of the three novels and one that could very easily be read as a stand-alone book.  <br />	2005-09-06

It is also unfortunately out of print, though there are a great many used copies out there at relatively cheap prices. <br /> <br /> _Mysterium_ is a book one could place in the \\"island in the sea of time\\" sub-genre of books on alternate history and parallel universes, one made famous recently by of course _Island in the Sea of Time_ by S. M. Stirling (1998), _1632_ by Eric Flint (2000), and _Weapons of Choice_ by John Birmingham (2004) and their sequels, the premise being that some little corner of the modern day world (or a whole fleet instead of an island or a town in the case of _Weapons of Choice_)  of our Earth gets sent into the past (which becomes from that point on a parallel universe, when those people from our time interact with the rest of the world). _Mysterium_ differed in two respects; first, this story came first (for whatever that is worth), as it is copyright 1994, and second, the town of Two Rivers, Michigan found itself in is a parallel universe from the beginning, contemporaneous with our Earth but with a history that diverged from our own close to two thousand years ago. But I get ahead of myself. <br /> <br /> An archaeological team working in a remote area of Turkey on what was believed to be a rather unremarkable prehistoric site came across what looked like a bit of jade embedded in the soil. Remarkable in its own right, further digging revealed that what was assumed to be a small piece was actually part of a much larger item that was not actually jade but some strange substance with extremely unusual optical properties. Of great interest - and unfortunate to its discoverers - the item was also extremely radioactive, many of those who discovered it dying quickly of radiation sickness. Obviously an item not of this Earth, with Turkey's permission the United States government removed it under heavy protection to a new research facility built just to study it, one set up on an old and largely abandoned Indian reservation near the quiet town of Two Rivers, Michigan. The base, very much aloof and apart from the town, at first piqued the curiosity of the locals, wondering what the meaning of the new base was in an era of declining defense spending and also hopeful of new jobs. When the new jobs don't really materialize to any great degree and the base stayed extremely quiet, they quickly forgot about it. <br /> <br /> One night though - a mere twelve pages into the book I would like to add - mysterious bright lights and an explosion at the facility, just visible to those in the town, heralded a bizarre event, one that removed the entire town and the military base to a parallel universe, the exact same spot on the globe on a world with a totally different history, in an alternate Michigan. Fully aware that there was some accident at the base, the townspeople awoke to find the power, water, and phones out, and those few with battery powered radios not able to get any stations except for a very distant one, one that seemed to be putting on some quasi-religious radio play of all things. Most just went on with life for a bit as best they could, hopeful that the utilities would be restored, though several tried to leave town and made an amazing discovery; all roads and trails out of town just stopped, ending in a cut as sharp as if a laser had made it. So sharp was the divide that trees were split right down the middle along the line, bare heartwood exposed for all to see. The other side of the line, inches beyond the road, was virgin forest, deep dark woodlands that had never known an axe. <br />  <br /> One of the locals who possessed a floatplane took off, hoping to uncover more of this mystery. He found that the town was now deep in the wilderness, all nearby other roads and towns long vanished, and what should be Detroit had completely different architecture, odd-looking cars, and even horse-drawn wagons. Heading back home, his flight apparently attracted the attention of the authorities of this world, who moved in with aircraft, tanks, and soldiers, putting the town under martial law.  <br /> <br /> The startled locals learned that they were in an alternate reality; they were not in the United States of America, but in an entity called the Consolidated Republic, a French-English nation that ruled most of North America and was regrettably run by an authoritarian religious theocracy. What's more, it was not a Christianity as the townspeople knew it; it became apparent later in the book that the Christianity in this world was a intolerant descendent of Gnostic Christianity, this world's history having diverged considerably during Roman times, as the Roman Empire never became Christian and indeed even to the present Apollo and other Greco-Roman gods were still worshipped in many countries of Europe (ones at war with the Consolidated Republic). The locals privately derided this world's Christianity as being practically polytheistic, while the Proctors (much feared Gestapo-like religious police of the Bureau de la Convenance Religieuse) despised the Two Rivers Christians as worshipping a \\"stick figure Christianity,\\" one unbelievably crude and simplistic. <br /> <br /> Regrettably, the conflict between Two Rivers and the authorities was much more severe as that, as the Proctors had dire plans for the town, for they believed it to be both incredibly useful as source of advanced technology and weaponry (being about roughly 50 years ahead of them) and as a blasphemous and dangerous threat to their social order. The remainder of the book dealt with the ugly plans of the Proctors and the secret resistance lead by several townspeople and their sympathizers.  <br />	2005-08-29

I thoroughly enjoyed it and found it a satisfying end to the series, though there were some unanswered questions, perhaps unavoidable given the almost unfathomable and deeply alien nature of the Spinners and the Starfish.  <br /> <br /> In fact, if I had any complaint about the book, it was at the end one never really truly understood what it was the Spinners and the Starfish - collectively known as the Ambivalence to the Yuhl - were doing. Sure, lots of theories were put out by Peter Alander, Caryl Hatzis, and the various engrams, but even at the very end (sorry if this is a spoiler) the reader doesn't know for sure. As I wrote, perhaps that is unavoidable given how vastly alien the authors made the Starfish and Spinners.  <br /> <br /> That doesn't mean the story is not otherwise excellent. The bulk of the book centered around a desperate mission by Peter, several versions of Caryl (both the original, Sol, and two other engrams of her), and one of the Frank Axford engrams to seek out the Starfish, first to do battle with them with a fleet of hole ships and probes to gain intelligence, then to infiltrate one of their massive vessels and hitch a ride to the Starfish fleet, in hopes of communicating with them, passing information to them about a star system that they have reason to believe to be the Spinner base in hopes of ending their destructive path through the stars. Unsure if they can even get aboard, survive while there, find someone to talk to in the Starfish fleet (rather than be destroyed out of hand), and get the Starfish to believe them, it is a plan with a lot of \\"ifs,\\" very bold to be sure, but their last, best hope for those engrams and Yuhl who were not fleeing the Starfish front, attempting what some among the Yuhl called the \\"Species Dream,\\" of finding a permanent home on a planet, hopefully having successfully neutralized or avoided the Starfish threat. <br /> <br /> As in the second book, there were a number of surprises, particularly with regards to the Starfish themselves, the true nature of the Yuhl, and to the ultimate abilities of Frank Axford. While there was definitely an ending, the authors did leave room to explore the setting again. If they did, I would be interested in revisiting this universe.  <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the trilogy as a whole and would definitely recommend it to anyone.  <br />	2005-08-26

I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and consider it to be among the top space operas of all time (using the term \\"space opera\\" in a non-derisory and positive way of course).  <br /> <br /> By the end of the previous novel all traces of civilization in the Sol system as well as in the system of Peter Alander's ship, the _Frank Tipler_ (and in several other systems reached by UNESSPRO vessels) have been destroyed by the terrifying and seemingly indestructible race dubbed the Starfish, so-called thanks to the appearance of their spinning, multi-armed, deadly ships. Ignoring all attempts at communication, they destroyed completely and utterly any civilization that made use of the FTL communication system provided by the Gifts (which unfortunately was a form of broadcast and could not be directed only at one individual destination; once made use of, everyone could pick up on the signal over a very large area). The situation at the end of the last novel was quite grim, as there was only one true human left alive, the original Caryl Hatzis, the sole survivor of the UNESSPRO program pressed into service by the Vincula to handle Peter Alander's arrival in the Sol system and by accident the only one that survived the destruction of the Vincula. She, along with Peter, the only survivor of the _Frank Tipler_, made it their mission to save what remained of humanity, the engrams of the  nearly one thousand other UNESSPRO missions, scattered across the galaxy, uniting them to run, hide, or fight if possible. <br /> <br /> I am not sure how much I should say about what happened in this novel, so full of twists, turns, and surprises was it. For those who want to have all the surprises intact for them to enjoy I say stop reading this review and get this book! If you liked the first one, you'll love the sequel.  <br /> <br /> Otherwise, in brief we pickup the story with Peter and Caryl working to contact other colonies, particularly those that have the Gifts, acquire more hole ships, and laboring to unite the survivors, warning them of the Spinners and also of the deadly Starfish. There is some intrigue as Caryl sought to take control of the scattered engrams, particularly over her own engrams, while others  - notably Peter  - were at odds with this arrangement. A major factor is that several of the Vincula enhancements that Caryl possessed gave her tremendous advantages over the engrams, which to her were very antiquated and often deeply flawed software (and in truth inherent shortcomings in the engrams endangered their long term survival).  <br /> <br /> Two new actors came into play fairly early on in _Orphans of Earth_. While surveying systems in the path of the Spinners, Peter and one of Haztis's engrams discovered a secret colony that they knew nothing about, a colony comprised entirely of engrams of one person, a military leader, secret agent, and one of the project administrators, Frank \\"the Axe\\" Axford, who deleted all the other engrams on his colony ship, replicated himself many times, and constructed a military base. They find Frank busy studying the Spinners, the Gifts, and the Starfish and chastising Peter and the others for lousy tactics in dealing with their new enemy. Owing to his background and odd personality Frank had a completely different take on the Starfish situation and was a very interesting character, neither completely trusting nor completely trustworthy.  <br /> <br /> The other actor is a third race of aliens, the Yuhl/Goel, a fascinating and rather alien extraterrestrial species that have been living as scavengers for thousands of years, following in the wake of the Spinner/Starfish migration through the stars (the Yuhl/Goel referred to both of them together as the Ambivalence), trying to stay one step ahead of the Starfish while collecting as many of the Gifts for themselves as theycan, by theft if necessary.  <br /> <br /> Caryl and Peter (and the other engrams) contended with both Frank Axford and the Yuhl/Goel. Are they allies or enemies? Did the Yuhl/Goel show the way of the future - following the Spinners and Starfish, constantly running and hiding - or did they possess secret weapons and knowledge to defeat them instead? Was Frank going to turn out to be the secret weapon they needed, assuming they could trust him? <br /> <br /> An exciting book, the ending was riveting and awesome and I have already started reading the third book in the series, _Heirs of Earth_.  <br />	2005-08-19
US	52590451	R106NEQMKLD3ER	0451459334	543198748	Conquistador	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Intriguing, romantic, and action-packed "what-if"	_Conquistador_ by S.M. Stirling has one of the most interesting premises I have ever read in any science fiction novel. What if you discovered a portal - one that you created completely by accident and known only to you - that lead to an alternate North America, one where the Europeans never set foot, the only other humans on the continent the Native Americans? This idea was explored previously in the book _Wildside_ by Steven Gould (though in that novel there were no Native Americans but instead Pleistocene megafauna such as sabertooth cats); in that work, the small group of individuals who knew about the portal to an alternate world sought to mine well known sources of precious metals in the American West, selling it back in their home world. In _Wildside_, the gateway was discovered relatively recently in the novel's timeline and the book basically portrayed that world's first exploitation.      _Conquistador_ took that idea and ran with it. Instead of a relatively recent discovery, the alternate world portal was created in 1946 (the main events of the novel are set in 2009). Former solider John Rolfe, back from fighting in the Pacific during World War II, rented a house in Oakland, California. In the basement of the house with the aid of a radio set and a freak accident created a portal to the same location in a North America untrammeled by Europeans. Cautiously exploring it with a few Army buddies he trusted, he began to see that that world possessed real possibilities.     Fast forward to 2009, where we meet Fish and Game wardens Tom Christiansen and Roy Tully, working with the LAPD in investigating the smuggling of rare and endangered wildlife. They rescue a California Condor on one of their missions and consider it a job well done until interesting facts come to light. One, the condor's DNA does not match the gene pool of any condor group in captivity or the wild, and in addition is far healthier than a condor should be, with no traces to speak of of pesticides or pollution. Two, they find an amazing photograph of what appear to be actual, real-life Aztec priests, though a few are clad in Grateful Dead T-shirts. Dedicated and skilled investigators, they uncover more and more and cross paths with Adrienne Rolfe, descendent of the still living John Rolfe. Ostensibly working to help Tom and Roy, in reality she is there to prevent them from discovering the Gate to her world, one that links the Commonwealth of New Virginia (named because John Rolfe was descended from the John Rolfe of Jamestown fame, the one who married the woman nicknamed Pocahontas) and FirstSide (what those in the Commonwealth call their original, home dimension). I don't think I give too much away when I say that their investigation leads Roy and Tom to the Commonwealth and to uncovering a huge, sinister plot, one that has implications for both FirstSide but also (especially) for New Virginia.     Much of the book was a narrated tour of Commonwealth (though there is plenty of action at the end). We learn that it was never intended just to be a source of (quite vast) wealth (carefully laundered FirstSide through dummy corporations and used-up mines bought FirstSide), but in addition be a thriving, self-sustaining community, which by 2009 has a population of 150,000, with towns, roads, airports, restaurants, hospitals, schools, a military force (including aircraft), a fishing industry, and thriving agriculture. Though many of the original Settlers (and the \\"involuntaries,\\" forced settlers who accidentally discovered the Gate and were forced to settle in New Virginia) came from America, we learn that many came in waves from other parts of the world, notably Germany, Italy, and Dutch Indonesia in the 1940s, French North Africa and British Kenya in the 1950s and 1960s, and later on from Rhodesia, South Africa, and Russia through the 1990s. Though most of the Settlers live in the American West (and mostly in California), some settled in Hawaii or Australia.The Commonwealth of New Virginia is not truly a democracy, but more a (benign) feudal system, run by a group called the Thirty Families, mostly descendents of the original Army buddies brought over in the 1940s by John Rolfe, though with some additions since then. Different areas were allocated to different Families - the Collettas for instance taking Santa Clara Valley and the Rolfes the Napa region for instance - with other areas set aside as either common Commission area (which included several towns) or as basically national parks. This system is important to the plot of the novel and gave New Virginia a very different flavor from FirstSide America.      Other intriguing facts of varying degrees of importance to the main story are the fact that many of the Native Americans are still about and active; while large numbers died due to imported disease from John Rolfe and others in the 1940s, many yet still live, many basically living the same lifestyle they originally had and still not entirely happy with the newcomers. Several Native Americans become important players in the novel and I found them intriguing characters. Also, Rolfe made a number of interesting introductions (reminding me of an August 2005 article that appeared in the journal _Nature_ about \\"rewilding\\" North America); he brought over to New Virginia and successfully established populations of African elephants, tigers, lions, giraffe, rhinos, kangaroos (!), leopards, cheetahs, wild boar, and various antelope species into western North America, which apparently thrived alongside the already numerous pronghorn antelope, elk, deer, bison, bear, mountain lions, wolves, and coyotes.      An interesting setting, I have to say one I wouldn't mind living in; next to no taxes, no pollution, lots of beautiful wilderness, lots of job opportunities, though it could be a bit more democratic and is overly dependent upon FirstSide for technology, high-tech items, and heavy machinery (as well as movies and music). A sequel would be interesting.	2005-08-19
US	52590451	RJPSK6HKZZMFF	0345450361	507779835	Drowning World (Founding of the Commonwealth)	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Good story on a well-fleshed out alien world	_Drowning World_ is one of the most recent adventures set in Alan Dean Foster's fascinating Humanx Commonwealth setting. As in previous installments (it is not really a series as with the exception of the _Icerigger_ trilogy, they are stand-alone adventures in a shared universe), the setting is an alien world, rich with life, a native sentient species, and far from the centers of power in the Commonwealth. The planet in this novel is Fluva, the Drowning World, the \\"Big Wet,\\" a rain-drenched planet covered in dense tropical forest over most of its two main continents, unique flooded forests that for all for except about a month a year are under tens of feet of water, the result of near constant rain and vast, muddy, overflowing rivers. Dry land is very rare on this world, and the native sentient race (the bipedal, arboreal, cat-like Sakuntala) as well as the two immigrant races (the numerous rather alien Deyzara and the much less numerous humans) live in the trees, on suspended walkways and buildings hanging well over the waters, though with the advent of the Commonwealth most of these walkways are made of synthetic material generally hung not from trees (as the Sakuntala traditionally did) but from sturdy pylons sunk deep into the unseen bedrock below.  <br /> <br /> A rough, dismal world by human standards, one with a vast array of dangerous predators and venomous fauna, relatively few make their home there, generally either as a result of being assigned there by Commonwealth officials for administration purposes or to make money, particularly as bio-prospectors, searching out alien biota to produce lucrative new drugs, foods, and chemicals. Most of the non-native sentient population are Deyzara, imported to work as laborers, shopkeepers, and the like from Tharce IV. Highly mercantile (some say money-grubbing and greedy), they are disliked and resented by many of the Sakuntala, despite the fact that some Deyzara are fifth generation Fluvans. Further causes of resentment are their growing population - close to that of the rather sparse Sakuntala population - and their taking advantage of the Sakuntalans relative lack of knowledge of Commonwealth laws and trade. <br /> <br /> Foster followed two plotlines in this novel. The dominant one revolved around bio-prospector Shadrach Hasselemoga, a rather disagreeable man who went missing while in a deep and dangerous part of the flooded forest. When no one heard from him after his departure and his supposedly indestructible rescue beacon was discovered to be silent, Chief Administrator Lauren Matthias sent a highly skilled Sakuntala by the name of Jemunu-Jah and a Deyzara pilot known as Masurathoo on a rescue mission. The other plot line involved an uprising of dissatisfied Sakuntala against the Deyzara, with Matthias and the other Commonwealth officials caught in the middle. <br /> <br /> The rescue mission plotline to me was the more interesting, not that the other one did not have its merits. The first plotline was actually two, a rescue mission/story of survival, while also a mystery back in town, trying to find out why Hasselemoga's skimmer went missing in the first place. There is a large twist at the end, one that completely changed the status of the various races on the planet. I thought overall it was a pretty good book. It was a pretty fast read and I thought the world was rather well designed, not one of Foster's best but definitely was one of his better books.  <br />	2005-08-13
US	52590451	R1NM07LHKLPKD3	0345406451	628187452	The Howling Stones (The Humanx Commonwealth)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Enjoyable and fast reading adventure in the enjoyable Humanx universe	_The Howling Stones_ by Alan Dean Foster is a novel set in his Humanx Commonwealth universe, the setting of such earlier works as _The Icerigger Trilogy_ and _Cachalot_ and more recent efforts such as _Drowning World_. An enjoyable novel and a fast read it is similar to other books in the series, depicting exploration and adventure on alien worlds within the Commonwealth, worlds generally with distinct endemic sentient alien species. <br /> <br /> The world of this novel is known as Senisran, a largely ocean planet, devoid of any substantial continental landmass but instead spotted with thousands of islands, many of them in archipelagoes. Most of the islands are fairly small, the largest being about half the size of Madagascar. The climate over most of the globe is hot and humid, the islands being covered in tropical vegetation (with a fair amount of venomous fauna).  <br /> <br /> The native race is known as the seni and are bipedal humanoids, tending to be a bit shorter than adult humans, with smooth skin, pointed ears, drawn faces, relatively small mouths, and powerful hind legs easily capable of allowing their owners to hop great distances and over large obstacles. On the cover of the book one is depicted, the illustration pretty much spot-on for what is described in the text.  <br /> <br /> In the Humanx Commonwealth novels, there are two competing interstellar civilizations, rivals not unlike the two superpowers during the Cold War, one being the human-thranx (the thranx being an insectoid race, not seen in this novel and indeed most of the Commonwealth books), the other the AAnn Empire (this being a civilization of bipedal endothermic reptiles, something not unlike what dinosaurs might have evolved into according to some). Both the Commonwealth and the Empire have been in competition for control of Senisran, not through force of arms, but through diplomacy, trying to gain mineral and other rights to many of the various islands on the planet. Complicating their efforts tremendously is the fact that not only is there nothing approaching a world or even a regional government on Senisran, there are countless tribes, clans, and alliances, each with a unique governmental system, morality, mythology, religion, and/or social system. Making contact and trade arrangements with the stone age seni has been a time consuming and difficult process but has nonetheless yielded many successes. <br /> <br /> Until now that is. One particular island group, Parramat, has resisted all efforts by either the Empire or the Commonwealth. Eager for the rare earth mineral wealth of the archipelago, both powers have failed in efforts to get the Parramati to sign a mining treaty. Though physically no different in appearance from the other tribes and clans of the world, the Parramati are unique in having politely but stubbornly refused the gifts of both the Commonwealth and the Empire, disdaining all but the most basic of gifts, stating simply that it violates their kusum, their custom, to accept anything approaching advanced technology. They believe that they will be much better off following their centuries long tradition, that while they would accept humans and the AAnn as visitors and friends, they could not tolerate any large scale changes of their environment or society.  <br /> <br />In addition, the Paramati seem to have a unique governmental structure; they are almost totally democratic. There are big persons and little persons in the system, big persons having more of a say in things than a little person, though many little persons can outweigh individual big persons. There is not even a clan chief or tribal leader anyone can negotiate with; in essence, almost each and every adult on the island would have to agree to a treaty before it could take effect.  <br /> <br /> Enter Pulickel Tomochelor (Foster seems fond of tongue-twisting futuristic names for some of his main characters), a rather smug but accomplished xenologist ordered to journey to the island, aid the one human already stationed there, and secure a mining treaty. Supremely confident in his abilities, Pulickel believed that he could in a few months time come to understand the Parramati and get them to agree to mining. <br /> <br /> Of course, things do not go that easily. The one Commonwealth representative in the archipelago, the imposing and beautiful Fawn Seaforth, is quite a bit different in personality from Pulickel, and they don't see eye to eye at first, Fawn believing Pulickel humorless, uptight, by-the-book, and a bit smug while Pulickel in turn feeling that Fawn has gone native to some extent, has let standards slide while stationed alone in the tropical near-paradise, not properly attending to her duties, and too fun-loving. Further complicating their mission is the rival AAnn outpost on the opposite side of the archipelago, the aliens scheming how to win the islands to their side and possibly forcibly remove the competition.  <br /> <br /> The title of the book hints at a further complication; the natives seem to possess some sort of magic, various stones that are said to aid in fishing, farming, healing, weather-forecasting and what not. By themselves, the stones appear as green glassy volcanic rock, inert and unremarkable, but somehow when combined with other stones these rocks are rumored to be able to do very powerful feats. Is this true? If so, perhaps this explains the natives' unique resistance to the considerable charms offered by Empire and Commonwealth civilization and technology. And if true, is it magic, or something else?  <br /> <br /> The exact nature of the stone is revealed (to a large extent) and their ultimate implications were extremely interesting. The ending of the book I found quite surprising and wonder if Foster ever planned to follow up on it, though strictly speaking no sequel is really necessary. All in all a good solid effort and another nice installment in the Humanx Commonwealth series.  <br />	2005-08-09
US	52590451	R322RC4FRKM0BX	0312875843	457270368	The Collected Stories of Vernor Vinge	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Fantastic compilation of one of the greatest of SF authors	_The Collected Stories of Vernor Vinge_ is a wonderful compilation of  most of Vinge's short stories and novellas (there are only two omissions, _True Names_ and _Grimm's Story_, the latter of which became the core of one of his novels, _Tatja Grimm's World_). The short stories range in dates from the very first stories he ever had published, such as _Bookworm, Run!_, copyright 1966 and written while Vinge was a senior in high school, to one written just for this collection, _Fast Times at Fairmont High_, copyright 2001. They range in length from the 900 word story _Win a Nobel Prize!_ to the novella length _Blabber_, though most range somewhere in between. All told there are seventeen stories in this collection, two of which were collaborations (_The Peddler's Apprentice_ was written with Joan D. Vinge and _Just Peace_ was a joint effort with William Rupp). <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the collection, there weren't any stories that I disliked and some were extremely good. His earlier stories, notably _Bookworm, Run!_, were a bit rougher, not as well done as later stories (which is understandable) but even those I liked.  <br /> <br /> There were several themes explored in his stories, many of them noted by Vinge himself as a foreword and in several cases an after word accompanied each story, where Vinge discussed where he was in his writing career at that time, inspirations for the story, earlier versions of the story, how well he felt that tale has held up to the test of time, and whether or nor he planned (or plans) to further develop the characters or the setting. He revealed for instance in his commentary on _The Blabber_ that that story was both the sequel to the novels _A Fire Upon the Deep_ and _A Deepness in the Sky_ and at the same time a prequel, as he wrote _The Blabber_ first. <br />  <br />   Several of the stories were a bit dated, dealing with computer technology that has since become obsolete or with Cold War situations (or with post-World War IIIscenarios, which one can debate whether or not these settings are obsolete), though they were nonetheless well done fiction.  <br /> <br /> One of the themes explored by Vinge was the concept of the Technological Singularity or simply the Singularity, a problem he ran into as far back as his story _Bookworm, Run!_. Vinge felt that eventually thanks to biological evolution and to advances in technology future humanity will surpass current humans in terms of intellectual ability. Such superbeings would be nearly impossible to write about, that at that point human history will have reached a point that is impossible for modern humans to imagine, a \\"place where extrapolation\\" breaks down, a world that will be beyond our understanding. Such superbeings should be kept off stage, hinted at, perhaps only dealt with when they are children or otherwise weakened if at all. His coming to terms with the Singularity was behind the development of the various galactic zones of mental abilities and technologies (the Zones of Thought) in his critically acclaimed _A Fire Upon the Deep_ and _A Deepness in the Sky_ and in this volume _The Blabber_, behind the concept of the Slow Zone, a region of the galaxy where faster than light travel for instance was not possible and where superhuman intelligences could not function at greater than human levels, a region where one could set far future stories, have superhuman intelligences hinted at, but avoid going into realms that were \\"overtly science-fictional\\" or even fantasy. <br /> <br /> Another concept that Vinge explored was the idea of anarchy, as both a model of future human society and as one that alien beings might follow. _Conquest by Default_ examined how an anarchical system might exist within an alien society (and what would happen when this technologically and numerically superior civilization arrived on Earth) while _The Ungoverned_ (a short story set between two other novels of his, _The Peace War_ and _Marooned in Realtime_, all of which can be found together by the way in the book _Across Realtime_) looked at how such a (largely peaceful) system might arise in a post World War III America.  In both stories Vinge explored what set of assumptions exist for why the participants cooperate at all in such a system as well as what exists to prevent the formation of power groups that would be large enough to in effect constitute a government. While I don't agree with anarchy in any form, both stories were entertaining, with the aliens in _Conquest by Default_ quite alien indeed.  <br /> <br /> Several stories obviously dealt with aliens, from the anarchic Mikin in _Conquest by Default_ to the charming, funny, titular creature in _The Blabber_ to the frightening super race known as the Shimans in _Original Sin_. Vinge in my mind has always done an excellent job in constructing believable, interesting, and original alien species and civilizations. <br /> <br /> In closing this was an enjoyable collection, one that provided a lot of insight into Vinge's creative process and thoughts behind his stories, providing more details on some of his novels, and was useful I think to budding writers, illustrating things to do and not do in writing fiction (and selling it too). Hard to pick a favorite story, but I loved _The Blabber_ a lot, greatly enjoyed _Gemstone_ (a very atmospheric tale, to say anything about it would spoil it), and I also liked _Conquest by Default_ and _Original Sin_ a great deal as well. _Fast Times At Fairmont High_ I feel will likely prove very prophetic on many levels and enjoyed that one for that reason as well as it being good fiction.  <br />	2005-08-06
US	52590451	R1UJU8QKK5C6VN	0812545249	536696611	The Chronoliths	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Absolutely excellent and highly original science fiction	_The Chronoliths_ by Robert Charles Wilson has one of the most intriguing and original premises I have ever read in a science fiction novel. The book is presented as a memoir written in the first person by the main character, Scott Warden. He began the book relating his experiences in 2021 in an expatriate beach community in Thailand, where he was living with his wife, Janice, and their very young daughter, Kaitlin. Pretty much unemployed slacker \\"beach lizards\\" by his own description, fights with his wife over their future after his contract job as a computer programmer ended were forgotten after an extraordinary event. He and his friend Hitch Paley - a very colorful sometime-drug deal - journeyed a number of miles away to investigate the most extraordinary rumors. In an uninhabited forest near Chumphon a 200 foot tall stone pillar suddenly and very violently appeared overnight, collapsing all trees within a quarter mile and freezing ice out of the air in an immense and sudden blast of cold that accompanied its unexpected arrival. Hitch and Scott are among the first to arrive on the scene, skirting the Thai security cordon, seeing for themselves that the four-sided ice-encrusted pillar looked like it was made of some sort of deep blue glass, of incredibly smooth material that was obviously very exotic. Just before they left the pillar (to avoid being caught) they noticed that there is some writing on it, an inscription of some sorts. Though not able to read it themselves, it is later made public by the press. Written in a strange combination of pidgin Mandarin and basic English, it made clear that the monument was commemorating a battle, that it was erected in celebration of the surrender of southern Thailand and Malaysia to the forces of someone named Kuin. The fact that no one knew who this Kuin was was unusual enough, but even more startling was the date given for the battle; December 21, 2041. Twenty years in the future. <br /> <br /> Not long after that, another, even larger pillar appeared in the center of Bangkok, virtually obliterating the city with its violent arrival, killing thousands.  <br /> <br /> From that point on the book follows two threads, both of which intertwine. At the level of the \\"big picture\\" still other pillars suddenly and violently appear in Asian cities, killing tens of thousands, coring the hearts out of living cities, weakening and later virtually destroying national governments. Governments scramble at the technical level to study the exotic material of the pillars, to find out how they are being created, that if they are from the future how they are being sent back in time, scientists struggling to see if there is a way a pillar can be detected before its arrival and perhaps lives could be saved.  <br /> <br />At the political and societal level people become more and more worried about this Kuin. Who is he? What does he want? Is his victory inevitable? Will his apparent conquests be confined just to Asia, or it will spread to Africa, Europe, and the Americas? What can be done to stop him if anything? Are the pillars an indication that he cannot be stopped, is he actually creating the conditions for his own success, or instead sowing the seeds of his own destruction? The speculations on the nature of causality were fascinating, with various theories being presented on the effects these Chronoliths were having on future history. Governments started to fear that the researchers that they had working on the problem, coming closer to understanding the exotic material of the Chronoliths and more importantly their temporal displacement, might be more of a threat than a benefit; how do they know that they are not creating Kuin themselves, or training someone that would make the Chronoliths possible to start with?  <br /> <br />  Also very interesting was how society dealt with the issue of Kuin himself; some feared him, others embraced him. As nothing was known about Kuin other than the outcome offuture battles and his Stalinist style of sculpture, he became a template for thousands if not millions of people around the world to project their fears, hopes, and desires. Thanks to the destruction of cities in Asia, the effects this had on the world economy, and expectations over what the world would be like with his arrival (increasingly viewed over the years with a near apocalyptic fear), no one and nothing escaped the effects of the Chronoliths.  <br /> <br /> At the personal level we follow Scott's life in the remainder of the century, as events progressed towards the dreaded days of the first battle described by the Chumphon pillar, following his life and that of his wife, daughter, and his friend as well as several others along the way that became part of Scott's life. Are their lives inextricably entangled with the Chronoliths? By virtue of being near the first pillar, are their lives tied up with each other and with the coming of Kuin, or is it just a coincidence?  Do they have a special role to play?  <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this book, the more I read, the more I wanted to read. As events unfolded, as the timeline in the book got closer to December 21, 2041, I found myself very eager, that I couldn't wait to find out just who this Kuin was and how the book would turn out. No less interesting were the lives of Scott, his friends, and family. I found the characters very well drawn, each quite distinct and memorable, and really cared what happened to them. I can honestly say they are some of the most detailed characters I have read of recently. Certainly Scott himself was very well crafted.   <br /> <br />The book did not lack for action either, presented I thought in a realistic and very entertaining manner. An excellent book, I highly recommend it.  <br />	2005-07-27
US	52590451	R141E7DIXEKKZL	044100850X	474979519	Oceanspace	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Decent thriller, barely science fiction though	_Oceanspace_ by Allen Steele is a near future undersea thriller set in the year 2011, one that seemed pretty believable, a story that could occur at some point, though I think perhaps not as soon as the year of the novel's setting.  <br /> <br /> The primary locale of _Oceanspace_ is the largely self-sufficient undersea research station _Tethys_, located off the coast of Florida (a map would have been helpful but not essential). Actually, _Tethys_ is two stations. Above the waves is a facility not unlike an offshore oil rig, _Tethys 1_ which contains administrative facilities, a landing pad for VTOL aircraft, and other structures. The main research station, _Tethys 2_ is located 328 feet (100 meters) below, connected to _Tethys 1_ via a snorkel tube (which allows fresh air into the undersea habitat) and an interesting device called the OTEC (Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion) power plant, a series of large intake and discharge pipes, condensators, evaporators, and other devices designed to move cold water up from deep beneath the sea and warm water from the surface to run turbines to produce electricity, some of which is used to run desalination devices to provide water for the station. Moving between the two portions is not quick or easy, as _Tethys 2_ is under higher pressure, about ten atmospheres, and to avoid decompression sickness crew members must use special facilities to allow their bodies to adjust.  <br /> <br /> I found _Tethys_ well described and a believable and though I am certainly no expert, a workable design. The beginning of the book had a two page diagram of the station, focusing largely on the undersea portion, which I found helpful. <br /> <br /> The primary purpose of the privately owned station (built and run by the Yemaya corporation) is to facilitate the undersea mining of manganese nodules on the seafloor, a service performed by autonomous robotic submersibles, which harvest from a designated portion of the seafloor and are periodically relieved of their cargo by a manned submersible. Almost as important though is the harvest and study of organisms collected from deep sea hydrothermal vents, \\"black smokers,\\" which are used to produce lucrative chemicals and other biotech products. In addition, Yemaya rents out space on _Tethys 2_ to visiting marine biologists and geologists. <br /> <br /> There are several plotlines followed in the book. One plot involves industrial espionage, the nature of which does not become evident until later on in the novel. I found that storyline pretty interesting and thought it had an exciting climax. A second plotline involved possible sea monsters; the first chapter, one of the best in the book, vividly described an attack on a manned submersible that was going to relieve a robotic harvester of its cargo of manganese nodules. The sub's operator, Joe Niedzwiecki, barely escapes with his life as the huge creature attacks and nearly destroys his vehicle. One of the main characters of the book, Judith Lipscomb, a researcher based at the station with her submarine operator husband Peter, became obsessed with the creature, as in the past tracking down sea monsters had been a hobby of hers. When a new vent field is discovered, she hoped to use the mission to map and survey it from a research submarine to investigate the wreckage of Niedzwiecki's submarine and maybe even spot the creature. Though I do not wish to give too much away, I found that thread not explored to the degree I would have liked it; the creature in the end pretty much remained a mystery. I imagined maybe some huge revelation, a major discovery, maybe people fighting for their lives on _Tethys 2_ (thinking that perhaps this was why Steele went to such efforts to describe the facility) but alas that was not to be.  <br /> <br /> Other plotlines involve the interaction of the various characters. The Lipscomb's play host their niece, Andie Lipscomb, a seventeen-year old allowed to visit her aunt and uncle, and she went from some resentment at being there to being a valuable addition to the mission. I am glad they didn't make her out to be some sort of supergenius; I found her pretty believable, though I thought she had access to more things than would be probably happen in real life. The station also was host to a visiting reporter for _Millennium_ magazine (apparently a hipper version of _National Geographic_), one Leslie Sun, an aggressive, underhanded, pushy woman with designs on Peter Lipscomb, attempting to seduce him. I found her pretty one dimensional, put there to be hated, and didn't care much for her character. I have seen journalists beat up in other novels and while some certainly believe they may deserve it I don't know that I do. Still, she was integral to some of the other plots. <br /> <br /> Not a bad book, it had a good pace. I found the dialogue almost a tiny bit corny at times; not most of the time, most of the time it was fine, but just once in a while I would roll my eyes at some exchange, particularly the occasional joke or humorous remark. Occasionally an emotional reaction did not ring true with me, such as in one instance when a very upset Judith started laughing over some off-color remark made by someone else. As I have said, I wished that the sea monster angle was better explored, though I guess Steele was going for mystery rather than revelation. The overall story was believable, and except for the habitat itself and the level of technology on some of the submarines, the story was almost not science fiction, more of a straightforward thriller. It was apparent that for the most part that Steele had done some research, proudly noting that with a two page bibliography.  <br />  <br />	2005-07-25
US	52590451	R2ZMQO8PKKXQHV	0765342510	679672961	The Santaroga Barrier	Books	5	40	40	N	N	Excellent and unappreciated gem outside the Dune series	_The Santaroga Barrier_ by Frank Herbert features an odd choice for a hero; Dr. Gilbert Dasein, a psychologist from the University of California at Berkeley, employed to do of all things a market study. Meyer Davidson, agent of a powerful investment corporation, one that owns a chain of retail stores, was upset about what was termed in the marketing world as the \\"Santaroga Barrier,\\" Santaroga being a small farming community and town located in an idyllic mountain valley in California. Davidson was upset that his corporation - as well as others before him - had failed utterly in selling a variety of products to the people of Santaroga. No on in Santaroga bought cigarettes- those very few that were sold were bought by transients, people stopping in the community's one service station to buy gas - nor did they buy any wine, beer, produce, or cheese brought from outside the valley. The people of Santaroga would only eat vegetables, fruits, cheese, beer, and wine raised or made within the valley. A great many Santarogans worked to produce these items only for local consumption, as they \\"didn't travel well.\\" The largest of these institutions was the Jaspers Cheese Cooperative, a large factory-like complex that employed many in the little town.  <br /> <br /> Dasein, with the help of the head of the university's psychology department, Dr. Chami Selador (working outside Santaroga), uncovered a few more interesting facts, notably that outsiders never found a house to rent or buy in the valley, no one moved out, and Santaroga never reported any mental illness, juvenile delinquency, or crime to state officials. All businesses, including the bank and the gas station, were locally owned. A few Santarogans left to go to college outside the valley - that was where Dasein met his girlfriend, Jenny Sorge, a native of Santaroga - and a few others served in the draft in Vietnam (the book was published and presumably set in 1968; various minor details such automobile technology, clothing styles, and the like point to this time period but are not essential to the story), though many come back due to unexplained allergic reactions to Army food.  <br /> <br /> Mindful of the lack of success of previous attempts to understand this mysterious \\"Barrier\\" and particularly of the fact that the last two people to investigate Santaroga met accidental deaths, Dasein journeyed to the town. Dasein finds at first a seemingly normal town of diners, farms, nice homes, a post office, and the like, a typical agricultural community. Several things though begin to get his attention; he isn't there long before he notices that the townspeople have a certain way about them, that they all seem very alert, to have excellent memories, a bit abrupt, sometimes rude, but at other times extremely caring and solicitous. Also, they are unfailingly and unswervingly honest, again almost to the point of rudeness. In addition, it seems everyone he meets knows who he is and his relationship to Jenny Sorge, as well as often knowing in general what he had done earlier that day.  <br /> <br /> Of greater interest though is the nearly fatal accident that befalls Dasein upon his arrival. His first night in the town's one inn nearly was his last as he almost succumbed to an old-fashioned gas jet for a lamp that was left on high. When he awakens after that ordeal, he finds that his briefcase - with his notes for the study - is missing and is in the possession of the town's lone law enforcement official. Invited to dine with him the next day, the man, Captain Al Marden of the Highway Patrol, questions his intentions in the town, making it obvious that he had gone through Dasien's belongings. While not threatening Dasein, Marden made it clear that the people of Santaroga were well aware of his reasons for being in the town, and while they supported \\" our Jenny\\" and therefore tolerated Dasein (to an extent), they did not care a lot for his marketing study. Dasein started to notice patterns inthe speech and thoughts of Santarogans, of them often speaking of a \\"they\\" and a \\"we\\" and viewing the outside world in hostile terms, of being greatly suspicious of those from outside the valley, dealing with them only as much as they had to. <br /> <br /> So, are the people of Santaroga just mildly eccentric, perhaps survivalists of a sort, wishing to have as little to do as possible with life outside of Santaroga? Or is there something else at work, something perhaps sinister, otherworldly, and alien? This being a science fiction novel, I am sure you can guess the answer, at least in general terms. The process where Dasein uncovers just what makes Santaroga the way it is was interesting and well written. Herbert did an excellent job building up a sense of mystery, and I enjoyed Dasein's interactions with a cast of very well drawn characters, notably Marden, Winston Burdeaux (a waiter at the Inn, one of the few \\"Negroes\\" in the town and not originally native to the valley), and Dr. Piaget, uncle to Jenny Sorge and the town doctor. If there was a weak point, it was Jenny Sorge; I never could determine why Dasien loved her so much, I found her character a bit vacuous, not as well drawn as many of the others, though it is possible Herbert meant it to be this way.  <br /> <br />As Dasein got further and further into the mystery (and further and further under the influence of Santaroga's spell), there were many philosophical discussions, several I am sure reflecting points Herbert wanted to make about life and society as a whole. Many of these were made during some rather lengthy exchanges between Piaget and Dasien. It seemed that in addition to the \\"Jaspers effect\\" that was at work Piaget was trying to appeal to Dasien as a psychologist, to become one of them, a native of Santaroga.  <br /> <br />An interesting and short early novel of Herbert, I read it in a little over a day.  <br />	2005-07-20
US	52590451	R3MLH7P4LDCM9U	0441008925	517711274	Echoes of Earth	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Epic science fiction story with unusual protagonists	_Echoes of Earth_ by Sean Williams and Shane Dix in the opening pages introduces us to the character Peter Alander, a member of the deep space survey ship _Frank Tipler_. Launched in the year 2050 and traveling at 80% the speed of light, the _Tipler_ carried Alander and the rest of his crew 72 light years from Earth to the star Upsilon Aquarius. They were sent there to survey the third planet in the system, a planet named Adrasteia, one that was known to be the source of oxygen and water spectra detected by interferometers in the Sol system.  The _Tipler_ was one of a thousand other similar survey ships launched as part of the United Near-Earth Stellar Survey Program (UNESSPRO) in a great wave of exploration.  <br /> <br /> In a real twist Alander is not human. Nor is anyone else on the _Tipler_.  Or at least, not completely human. Alander, mission leader Caryl Hatzis, and the dozens of other specialists on the _Tipler_ are engrams, electronic simulations of actual people, people that were chosen in the 2040s to have their thought processes copied and molded into a highly complex simulations, ones that could perform - hopefully - just as well as their originals could. Carefully modeled to experience such hormonally influenced traits as desire, hunger, and fatigue, they nevertheless were much better suited to the rigors of interstellar travel. Not only weighing virtually nothing (as it is extremely expensive to accelerate anything to near light speeds), they are much better suited to survive the nearly one hundred year trip to Upsilon Aquarius, able to adjust their internal clocks or even shut themselves off to avoid consumption of resources and to avoid boredom.  Once at the planet they generally stayed purely electronic, interacting in a virtual ship-wide environment called ConSense, though they can elect if resources permit to grow and inhabit partially biological androids. In the case of the _Tipler_ mission Alander was the only individual to inhabit such a body,though this was done in large part to keep his engram from breaking down, as he was in danger of merging with and losing his distinctiveness within ConSense due to an apparent flaw in his pattern.  <br /> <br /> At first the survey looked routine, as while Adrasteia had life, there wasn't much of it; just simple cyanobacteria analogues surviving in the clouds thanks to the planet's bizarre climate. Things did not stay that way for long. After some unusual energy discharges near Adrasteia, strange, perhaps alien objects appear in orbit around the planet. Quickly dubbed Spinners by the crew, they within less than a day construct ten orbital towers around the planet's equator, towering structures that reach from the planet's surface up into space, connected by a vast ring. Ignoring all hails from the _Tipler_, there is only one apparent means of interaction; what looks to be an elevator of sorts in the base of one of the towers. Against the wishes and at first without the knowledge of Hatzis and the others, Alander steals a shuttle and flies to that tower and takes the lift. Once inside, he finds that the towers were indeed built by an alien intelligence, a race that is vastly superior technologically to the one the engrams came from. Greeting Alander is a highly complex artificial intelligence that they dub the Gifts, for they inform Alander that they are in fact a gift from this race, the Spinners. Refusing to answer any questions about the Spinners themselves - claiming that they do not possess such knowledge - the inform Alander that he has been specially selected to act an emissary to those on the _Tipler_, that the Gifts will speak to him and him alone, guiding him to the various treasures in the towers.  <br /> <br /> For purposes of the story the two most significant of the various gifts are faster-than-light communication, and a small faster-than-light ship that the Gifts tell Alander is called a hole ship. Using the communicator, they send a message to Earth. They receive no reply. The _Tipler_ had lost contact with Earth during the flight to Upsilon Aquarius but felt it was possibly due to any of a number of reasons, including time lag. After some discussion and a near disastrous crisis, Alander decides to pilot the hole ship back to the Sol system (being the only one that the Gifts will allow to do so). <br /> <br /> What he finds upon his return astounds him. Though he thought he was prepared to have found humanity to have vastly advanced during the hundred years he had been gone, Alander was shocked. Venus and Earth were missing, and there was a vast structure in its place instead, the start of a Dyson sphere. Artificial intelligences, having become self-aware after the _Tipler_ left, nearly wiped out humanity, with only 3 million still alive, many of those not entirely biological any more. Alander, ignorant of current Sol politics, tries to contact whatever successor exists to UNESSPRO. Instead he comes to the attention of the Vincula, a group mind of sorts that rules the system now, one that attempts to use Caryl Hatzis, the sole surviving engram contributor, to gain control of Alander and gain access to the Gifts.  <br /> <br />Alander's arrival touched off a conflict within the system, the Vincula viewing his apparently faster-than-light ship as extremely valuable while the few remaining individualists were not keen to let the Vincula control the technology, the latter trying to oppose the Vincula.  Though that seems bad enough at first, a far, far worse conflict occurs. Humanity learns the terrible, awful consequences that result from the use of the Gifts, not one coming from the Spinners, but from some other, darker alien menace.  <br /> <br />According to the Gifts, \\"There are civilizations who take delight in the destruction of others.\\" <br /> <br />And thus begins a trilogy. Things look extremely bleak at the end, but there is a ray of hope. I found it very well written and highly engaging and look forwardto other books in the series.  <br />	2005-07-19
US	52590451	R10UIKW004JVJT	0441011020	80979198	Chindi	Books	4	0	2	N	N	Good solid deep space adventure	_Chindi_ by Jack McDevitt is a well done hard science fiction novel, to me a good \\"meat and potatoes\\" adventure set in deep space, with lots of action, mysteries to solve, a good deal of science, and a real almost Golden Age sense of wonder. I did not know the novel was part of a series when I began it, only discovering this to be the case after I read some reviews of it after I had finished. Though events from other novels in the series were briefly referenced, _Chindi_ for me worked quite well as a stand-alone book.  <br /> <br /> By the early 23rd century (the book ends in the 2228), humanity has been cruising through the stars in faster-than-light ships known as superluminals for almost fifty years. Although there were understandably high expectations at first, very little in the way of extraterrestrial intelligence has been discovered by the beginning of the events in _Chindi_. Only one spacefaring civilization has been discovered, called the Noks, though they are at a stage that would appear equivalent to 20th century Earth. In addition, the Nok's civilization is highly fractured along various social lines and it would appear has proved very frustrating to those among humanity who wished to have relations with it. Except for the Noks, what humanity has found to date have been ruins. Places such as Quraqua, Pinnacle, and Beta Pac have produced intriguing, often highly enigmatic ruins and artifacts, even evidence that there were once interstellar species, but not one living, intelligent, civilized being (though some savage, Stone Age groups have been discovered, humanity it seems avoids them). Civilization it would appear in the big scheme of things is rather short-lived. The universe is cold, dark, and lonely.  <br /> <br /> Though the Academy of Science and Technology was founded in part to study these ruins on the various worlds, there are still those who are unsatisfied with xenoarchaeology and instead long for a meaningful exchange with a living, breathingpreferably elder race, one perhaps that would have the secrets to the deep mysteries of life, or at least be able to provide an interesting exchange on philosophical issues (why the Noks are not at least interesting conversational partners was never explained). One such group of individuals is the Contact Society, a maligned group of mostly amateurs (scientists avoid the group for the fear it will damage their professional reputations) still eagerly seeking out a spacefaring, advanced, extraterrestrial intelligence. Thought of as generally at best as a bunch of mildly eccentric amateurs, at worst as crackpots and lunatics, nonetheless several of its members are quite wealthy and influential. One member of the Contact Society, George Hockleman, is a multibillionaire and an important sponsor to the generally fund-starved Academy, while others are well known in the entertainment industry, such as Tor Kirby, a worlds renowned painter, and Alyx Ballinger, an actress. <br /> <br /> A deep space survey ship, orbiting the neutron star VV651107, received an anomalous reading, a two second apparently artificial radio signal. Greatly intrigued, the survey ship stayed in the system for as long as it could in order to try to determine its source and destination, launching various satellites to do so, but was forced to return to Earth empty-handed after six months of fruitless searching. This discovery became quite well known and while most in the scientific community seemed to have become resigned to the notion that it may have been a sensor glitch, members of the Contact Society felt otherwise. Putting pressure on the Academy, Syliva Virgil, the Director of Operations, recruited superluminal captain Priscilla Hutchins (the main character of the novel) to pilot a ship, the _City of Memphis_, out towards 1107. Though Hutchins was wanting to quit working for the Academy after a rescue mission that was very nearly botched by several Academy bureaucrats, Virgil persuaded \\"Hutch\\" that all she had to do was ferry several member of the Contact Society - including Hockleman, Kirby, and Ballinger among others - to 1107, look around, and come back, a PR exercise to keep them happy, Virgil not expecting them to find anything.  No science team would be present (though one of the Contact Society members was a scientist). If something was actually discovered, the Academy would dispatch a science team, but otherwise could not weather the political charges of squandering money to pursue what many would regard as a wild-eyed project. Hutch, against her better judgment, agreed, in part because a love interest was going to pilot his ship and several other Contact Society members to the destination source for the signal (after that was ascertained) while she took _Memphis_ to 1107.   <br /> <br /> Against all expectations, they discover not only more signals but also the source of those signals; stealth satellites, a trio of them, not only in orbit around the neutron star but also around the world that was the destination for the signals, a planet that once held intelligent life (a terrestrial world that apparently had gone through a global nuclear war). The remainder of the novel follows the _Memphis_ as her crew discovers that this is just the tip of the iceberg, that a series of such satellites are found in a number of systems, a network put up by some unknown extraterrestrial intelligence to observe interesting astronomical phenomena and intelligence species in several systems. While most of the satellites are quite old, a few are found to be quite recently constructed; who put up the satellites, who is maintaining them, and where does the network end? The mission is not an easy one, as several of the Contact Society members die along the way, investing blood and lives in their increasingly significant quest.  <br /> <br /> I found the mystery intriguing, though Hutch and the others never in the end get all the answers (which I also liked). The ending wasfantastic, a gripping, thinking-outside-the-box hard science fiction answer to a problem, a daring rescue mission. I will definitely track down more novels in this series.  <br />	2005-07-16
US	52590451	RMNO48Z2UI9D6	0312857586	349351971	Shadow of the Giant (The Shadow Series)	Books	5	7	8	N	N	A great end to a great series.	_Shadow of the Giant_ by Orson Scott Card is the fourth and apparently final installment in the _Ender's Shadow_ series (or subseries as I have seen it referred to), the series of novels that began with a \\"sidequel\\" to _Ender's Game_ and evolved into its own series, portraying the life and times of characters other than Ender Wiggin. An impressive, gripping, and very well written climax to a series that began ultimately back in 1984 with _Ender's Game_, Card skillfully wrapped up the plot threads explored in the subseries, including how Bean (also known as Julian Delphiki) dealt with his impending death, greatly hastened by his genetic condition, Peter Wiggin's (the Hegemon, Ender's older brother) struggle to set up a peaceful world government, finding Volescu (the man responsible for creating Bean), and Bean's  and Petra's (Petra Arkanian, Bean's wife)  efforts  to find their stolen children.        The various members of Battle School, notably members of Ender's jeesh, are well explored and are major characters in the book (as they were in previous installments of the _Ender's Shadow_ series), with Han Tzu in China, Virlomi in India, and Alai in the Muslim world becoming powerful leaders in their respective nations/regions. Selected for Battle School because of impressive levels of intelligence, intuition, logic, military skill, and ambition, individuals ideally suited to help win the war against the Buggers, they became huge problems back on Earth, put to use by their home countries in wars of conquest and ultimately becoming the rulers of several of these nations. Will people chosen to save humanity from alien invasion ultimately be its downfall as they encompass the globe in ever larger wars? Will they ultimately unite the Earth under one of their respective empires, or will the Hegemon be able to do it instead, without respect to nationality and done so in a democratic way? Or will they instead destroy the world?     The International Fleet- officially neutraland powerless in affairs on Earth - recognized the problem posed by its ambitious and highly skilled Battle School graduates (all potential Genghis Khans and Alexander the Greats) and sought to behind the scenes stop the world from being torn apart by them, preferring instead to have the world united peacefully and democratically by the Hegemon. Mazer Rackham (the man who beat the Second Bugger Invasion, preserved thanks to relativistic effects) and Colonel Graff (now Minister of Colonization) approached Dink, Vlad, Han Tzu and the other graduates with offers to leave Earth and rule colonies elsewhere, both to ensure the survival of those particular colonies and of the Earth as a whole. Do they take this offer, or stay behind?     Politics is a huge component of this novel and I found it extremely well presented. Card I believe got a decent handle on the history and culture of several of the major nations and cultures dominant in the book, and also provided some very interesting exploration of themes that resonate in today's world. Will the United States continue to be the world's policeman, combating disorder around the globe, or will it retreat back into isolationism after decades of frustration, mounting foreign hostility, and perceived ingratitude? Will Europe continue to \\"flirt\\" with a true supranational government or will it actually achieve it? Can governmental institutions in other nations or in a world government be created so strong as to survive \\"corruption, stupidity, vanity, ambition, recklessness, and even insanity\\" in its leaders, or was the United States perhaps a unique exception?      A major theme Card explored and one key to the plot of the novel is the nature of Islam. Is it a \\"one-way religion?\\" Card has his characters postulate that Islamic law and society might not ever truly be liberalized, that as long as ordinary Muslims believe it to be their duty to kill any Muslim who tries to leave the fold and that it is their duty to resort to armsto compel unbelievers to obey Islamic law, that it will never be a decent religion, not only for unbelievers but also for its own members, as Islam will always become dominated by those willing to \\"wrap themselves in the crescent flag\\" and murder people in the name of God. Until people are free to leave the Islamic fold and safely and prosperously be non-Muslims in an Islamic society, Islam will always be seen as a threat by the other cultures of the world (as well as create a society of fear for its own members).     I really enjoyed the dialogue in the book, and indeed in the seven other books in the Ender series it has all been exceptionally well done. Card created characters that can have a conversation on several levels, with what is left unsaid or hinted at as important as or more important than what is actually said. Plans within plans swirl through the book, with characters able to adapt quickly and readily to changes in circumstances and to surmise the goals of their opponents from the smallest of hints. The only other author I have previously read who is able to write this type of dialogue (or create these types of characters) has been Frank Herbert (at least in the _Dune_ series).      In conclusion this was an excellent novel and a fast read. I would love to see further exploration of the Enderverse. Though events on Earth appear to be pretty well wrapped up, Bean's storyline could possibly continue. Additionally, it would be interesting to revisit Ender himself one day.  A great end to a great series.	2005-07-09
US	52590451	R10D11NBY5Y1JV	0865475261	577284164	Olives: The Life and Lore of a Noble Fruit	Books	5	27	27	N	Y	Delightful book on all things olive	_Olives_ by Mort Rosenblum is a well-written, witty, and engaging book on all things olive, thorough in its coverage. Rosenblum became an olive aficionado after acquiring five acres of land in the Provence region of France, site of an abandoned farmhouse and two hundred half-dead and heavily overgrown century-plus olive trees, long neglected. From that point on he became not only committed to bringing his trees back to life but on becoming an expert on olives in general, traveling throughout France, Israel, Palestine, Spain, Italy, Tunisia, Morocco, Greece, the former Yugoslavia, California, and Mexico to speak to olive growers, those who press olives for their oil, government regulators, those involved in marketing table olives and olive oil, chefs, and nutritional experts. Though not a cookbook, _Olives_ even includes cooking, buying, and storage tips  as well as recipes for such fare as eliopitta (a Cypriot olive bread) and imam bayaldi (the name meaning \\"the imam fainted,\\" supposedly reference to a long-ago reaction to this eggplant and olive oil dish).<br /><br /> The origins of the domestication of _Olea europaea_ are lost in the mists of prehistory. The olive, a close relation to the lilac and jasmine, was maintained in groves in Asia Minor as early as 6000 B.C. Greeks, Phoenicians, and Romans spread olives to Sicily, the Italian mainland, France, Spain, and North Africa. Spanish missionaries in the 1500s brought the olive to California and Mexico. Today there are 800 million olive trees in the world. Though found on six continents, 90% of them are found in the Mediterranean (Spain has the most).<br /><br /> Olives have long been an important fixture in Mediterranean history and religion. Golden carvings of olives decorated ancient Egyptian tombs. Greeks used so much olive oil to lubricate their athletes that they invented a curved blade, the strigil, to scrape it off. Saul, the first king of Israel, was crowned by rubbing oil into his forehead. In Hebrew, the root word for \\"messiah\\" comes from \\"unguent,\\" meaning that the messiah when he arrives will be slathered in oil.  The fuel referred to in the miracle of Hanukkah was olive oil. The Old and New Testaments refer to olive oil 140 times and the olive tree 100 times. The Romans had a separate stock market and merchant marine dedicated just to oil.<br /><br /> Rosenblum vividly showed that olive oil is a nuanced as wine. There are seven hundred cultivated varieties, or cultivars, with some grown for pressing, others for eating, ranging from cailletiers (favored in salade nicoise) to malissi (the standard tree of the West Bank) to the hardy, wilder Moroccan picholine to the famous Greek Kalamata.  Oils vary a lot in taste, from syrupy yellow oils of southern Italy to thin green Tuscan oils with a peppery after bite to the spicy and light oil of the Siurana region of Spain. Acidity and taste vary due to local cultivators, the weather that year, the presence or absence of pests, when the olives are harvested, and how long they sit around before pressing (as fermentation drives up acidity).<br /><br /> There are regional differences in harvesting olives. In Israel, Palestine, and France, they \\"milk\\" trees, the pickers using their fingers and dropping olives into a basket or a net under the tree.  \\"Whackers\\" - prevalent in Spain, Italy, and Greece - use sticks to hit the branches to dislodge olives, faster and not requiring ladders, but tougher on the trees.<br /><br />The actual process of pressing olives is extremely well-covered, Rosenblum vividly describing the one favored in most olive-growing countries, the modern continuous system (which uses linked centrifuges to grind up pulp), often highly automated, and the traditional method of using a tower press, which is a very interesting device (though labor-intensive and on the decline outside of niche markets). There are considerable debates in the industry over exact methods, particularly on the use of water and its temperature.<br /><br /> Olives are big business; an industry producing about $10 billion a year as the world consumes nearly 2 million metric tons of olive oil each year. In some areas consumption is quite high; the average per capita consumption annually in Greece is five gallons of oil. Though Spain produces 37% of the world's oil compared to Italy's 19 % and Greece's 17%, it only has a 16% share of the American market (compared to Italy's 70% and Greece's 3%). Ten brands dominate the American domesticate market; most labels are small, sold only regionally or instead growers sell their olives to Italy to produced blended oils for export as a \\"Product of Italy\\" despite being grown perhaps in Tunisia, Greece, or Turkey. Rosenblum investigated the corruption that existed in the industry, from waning Mafia influence in Italy to adulterating olive oil with seed oil to cheating in some areas to gain EU agricultural subsidies.<br /><br /> Sales in olive oil have grown a great deal, particularly in the United States, thanks to a growing consensus on its healthfulness. Monounsaturated, olive oil drives out bad cholesterol without reducing the good. Rich in antioxidants, it has been shown to reduce the risk of breast cancer.<br /><br /> The author provided some valuable education to the consumer about oils. Extra-virgin for instance means that the amount of free fatty acids - mostly oleic acid - is below 1 percent, with the organoleptic properties (aroma, taste, and body) rating high. Virgin oil, rarely found for sale, has up to 2 percent acidity. Both are produced by \\"first-press\\" or \\"cold-press\\" methods. Plain olive oil, (or \\"pure\\"), is refined inferior oil used mainly for frying, treated with steam and chemicals and mixed with some better oil for a little flavor and aroma. Pomace oil comes from the first-press leavings, refined to bring it below the 3.5 percent acidity level that designates lamp oil, though often pomace is instead used to make soap (the oil for soap may have40% acidity). \\"Lite\\" oil has the same number of calories (125 per tablespoon), simply being a refined olive oil with less extra virgin added, a clearer color, cheaper to make, and inferior.	2005-07-03

Spar is a fascinating book on the history of business and politics in the fields of emerging technologies, one I honestly feel everyone should read, as it is invaluable for the sense of context and perspective it provides. <br />  <br /> Much has been made about how truly revolutionary the internet is, how that its very existence breaks all the old rules, that it is going to steer the world towards a new social order, perhaps even sever the link between the market and the state. Many prophets have proclaimed how the internet will create a realm where government has no force, where big business is powerless, and where many things - such as music - will essentially be free. <br /> <br /> Spar readily acknowledges that the net is indeed radical and that it will produce many changes in society, politics, government, and business. However, she sought through this book to show that the emergence of the internet is not without precedent, that it is perhaps just another arc along technology's frontier. By comparing the changes brought about by the development of transoceanic commerce during the Age of Exploration and the arrival of the telegraph, radio, satellite television, and publicly available encryption technology with the rise (and possible fall) of Microsoft (looking at both the issue of operating systems and web browsers) and the advent of MP3 technology, Spar showed how the worlds of government and commerce have coped again and again with what were at the time paradigm-shattering revolutionary developments. The end of the dominance of big business and government has been predicted several times before and in each case the prophets were wrong. In truth, there were significant changes and for a time governments were more or less powerless in some instances thanks to a gap between technology and policy, but these gaps did not last for long. While new technologies can wound government, they never kill it, and the very pirates and pioneers who for a time gleefully predicted its demise (or at least its powerlessness over them and their new realm of business) have in the end craved the stability and order offered by government. In essence, once they staked their claim in a new technological frontier, they wanted someone to protect that stake.  <br /> <br /> Each of these revolutions followed a predictable pattern as Spar brilliantly showed, beginning the book with an overview of this pattern and then in the following chapters showing how this pattern was followed in each instance (and along the way providing some fascinating history and anecdotes).  The first phase is that of innovation, the stage of \\"tinkerers and inventors,\\" not a phase marked by much if any commerce. It is populated by people interested in technology for its own sake, a world of fellow enthusiasts. Often in this early stage the new technology and its adherents are either largely unknown to the public or not accorded much respect. When Samuel Morse first demonstrated the telegraph to Congress in 1838, many just laughed. Generally in this stage most if not everyone involved is unaware of  any real commercial use for the new technology; when the radio first appeared it was seen as perhaps a useful adjunct to the telegraph, a way to communicate with ships at sea, not as a mass market for broadcasting music.  <br /> <br /> The second phase is populated by pioneers, individuals who have moved into the new technological frontier and have seen ways to make profits - often very large profits - from the new technology, carving new empires and entire new fields of commerce where previously none had existed, out of the reach of government and existing businesses. This phase is truly frontier-like; speed is essential, as many scramble to stake their claim, the individuals in question often being quite young (Marconi was 20 when he started marketing his radio in the UK while Marc Andreessen was 23 when he founded Netscape). Pirates exist of course too, drawn by the new wealth and near complete lack of rules. There is little to stop them as public policy simply has not caught up yet with the new frontier (such as when Rupert Murdoch started to broadcast satellite TV into the tightly controlled British market in the early 1980s).  <br /> <br /> The third phase is what she termed creative anarchy. This is the stage when the pioneers, those who are seeking to make a profit, start to demand rules. Property rights for instance are not an issue in the first phase, as many early inventors -such as with the telegraph or the internet - essentially distributed their breakthroughs for free. As the technology matures and early pioneers establish profitable enterprises in the new frontier, they seek protection from the chaos and pirates of the second phase. For instance while the relatively few users of radio in the 1910s could transmit signals to their heart's content as the radio waves seemed infinite and owned by none, by the 1920s established radio stations were keen to protect their stretch of the airwaves as what had once seemed infinite was now congested and crowded and early radio stations sought to keep from being drowned out by amateurs or competing stations. Before government stepped in this new market was in danger of grinding to a halt with the constant din of rival signals.  Similar problems occur over issues of coordination; whose standard is going to prevail in terms of say operating systems, and with competition, as often a single dominant pioneer emerges and creates a virtual monopoly, solving some problems but creating others (as with Western Union, Marconi, and Microsoft).  <br /> <br /> The final phase is the establishment of rules, when government reenters the scene, nearly always at the urging of the dominant companies in a new field. The original rush away from government has come full circle as \\"the rebels return to the state,\\" needing the state to secure their new wealth, to enforce issues of contracts, property rights, and provisions for standardization. Spar believed that the internet will reach this phase.  <br />	2005-06-30

Actually, to be more specific, it is a book about the importance of organisms' symbiosis with microbes (whether microbes with microbes or microbes with macroscopic organisms). The central tenets of this wonderful work are first that microbes (be they bacteria, protozoa, or fungi) are one of the most important innovative factors in evolution and are key parts of any ecology; Wakeford believed that the importance of the gene has been overemphasized. Secondly, interdependence among organisms is at least as important (if not more important) than competition between them; most organisms survive only by the \\"constant management\\" of their relationships with the microbes in and around them.  Far from constant competition, it is often difficult to tell where one organism ends and another begins. Thirdly, this is a dynamic relationship; relationships can change, partners in symbiosis come and go, and the mutalist of today can become the parasite of tomorrow. <br /> <br /> The acceptance of the importance of symbiosis and the beneficial role of microbes has been a long time coming. In the nineteenth century microbes first came to the attention of scientists thanks to the efforts of Louis Pasteur.  It was he coined the word \\"germ\\" and single-handedly brought about the \\"antibacterial age,\\" a time that lasted for several decades in which scientists saw microbes as things only to be eradicated. Additionally, views about symbiosis became tied up with the politics of the 1920s and 1930s, with bacteria and symbiotic relationships regrettably and very unscientifically becoming tied up with fears about Communism. It did not help that many pioneers in the field hailed from Germany and Russia.  <br /> <br /> Those who pointed out evidence of symbiosis often were met with derision and ignorant prejudice. Beatrix Potter was hounded out of biology in the1890s for her views that lichens were made up of the alliance of two organisms; when the London scientific community treated her with disdain if not hatred she became instead a noted children's author and illustrator. Earlier in 1869 the Swiss botanist Simon Schwendener offered his \\"dual hypothesis\\" for the taxonomy of lichen, noting that they were both a fungus and an alga; his theories and works were treated with contempt and for a time calling someone a \\"Schwendenerist\\" was a term of abuse, meaning someone who waffled between two competing explanations for something. The idea that symbiotic organisms could be passed from one generation to another was for a time discredited thanks to associations with pre-Darwinian French evolutionist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck.  <br /> <br /> Wakeford provided numerous fascinating examples of symbiosis in nature. Many species of orchids for instance are so dependent upon fungal symbionts in their roots that they cannot survive without them. In fact mycorrhizal fungi - underground fungi that exist in a symbiotic relationship with the roots of plants - are essential in allowing many plants to get enough of many nutrients (notably phosphate). So essential are they that 90% of the plants on Earth have domesticated their own species of fungus. Mycorrhizal fungi can form vast underground networks, often linking more than one plant together. One researcher by the name of David Perry has said that the sharing of fungal symbionts between trees is so important they form a superorganism, what he termed a \\"guild.\\" These fungal symbionts are known to allow one tree - perhaps suffering by being overly shaded - to draw upon the nutrients of another tree, thereby constituting a \\"mycorrhizal welfare state.\\"  <br /> <br /> In addition to colonizing roots symbionts can colonize other parts of the plant; tall fescue grass, a dominant grass in the United States, has a species of fungus (_Acremonium_) that grows in the spaces between the grass's cells. This symbiont offers resistance to drought, increases seed production, and produces toxic alkaloid compounds that put off plant-eaters. So intimate is the relationship that grass seeds are infected while still in the seed coat.  <br /> <br /> Other examples of symbiosis in nature include the relationships of deep sea organisms with bioluminescent symbiotic bacteria, chemosynthetic symbiotic sulfide bacteria living in _Riftia_ tube worms around hydrothermal vents, the bacteria that allow shipworms and termites to digest wood (or in the case of anobiid beetles, it is a yeast-like fungus that allows them to eat wood), and the bacteria and protozoa ecosystem that exists in the four-chambered stomachs of ruminants such as cattle, sheep, and deer that allow these animals to digest grass. The most important examples of symbiosis though are undoubtedly the acquisition in eukaryotic cells of chloroplasts and mitochondria, a momentous evolutionary event, an example of an extremely intimate and permanent form of intracellular symbiosis which Wakeford skillfully explained.  <br /> <br /> Many species very actively manage their microbial associates. Corals bleach themselves - bleaching being the loss of the coral's symbionts, called _Symbiodinium_ - as a natural strategy to deal with changing environmental conditions. They do this to alter the makeup of their symbionts, to allow themselves to be repopulated by a new type of associate, one that perhaps is better suited for a changed environment.  Researchers have discovered that leaf-cutter ants are continually domesticating new varieties of fungi by taking them into their nests; 862 types of nest fungi have been discovered, with evidence that ants periodically swap crop varieties with their neighbors.  <br /> <br /> As noted, the continuum between beneficial symbiont and parasite is a rather fuzzy continuum. Orchids for instance produce natural fungicides to keep their root symbionts from colonizing their stems; these and other plants can be overrun by their symbionts if they become weakened or malnourished. David Philip, the famous \\"bubble boy,\\" had to live in a sterile environment because his body had no ability to cohabit with the numerous microbial associates in the human body (symbiotic bacteria make up a tenth of our body's weight and totaling 90 trillion cells outnumber our own body cells nine to one). If the intestines of any human are damaged formerly beneficial symbiotic microbes can create a life-threatening infection called sepsis.  <br />	2005-06-19
US	52590451	R39LZ8OCVC803I	0802713726	726461342	Sahara: A Natural History	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Great overview of a fascinating land and its peoples	_Sahara_ by Marq de Villiers and Sheila Hirtle is an interesting and thorough book on the natural and human history of the Sahara. Very informative and comprehensive in scope, the authors tackled a variety of subjects relating to a land known also as the Endless Emptiness or the Great Nothingness.  <br /> <br /> The Sahara is vast, stretching from the \\"dried-blood-red cliffs\\" of Mauritania on the Atlantic coast to the \\"bleached bone\\" of Egypt's Eastern Desert on the Red Sea, from the Atlas Mountains of Morocco to the Sahel in the south, a desert that covers 3,320,000 square miles.  The Sahara one learns is not one vast sand sea (only about 15% is sand covered), though the dune fields (called ergs) can stretch for hundreds of miles. The desert also contains a nearly invisible network of watercourses, wadis, and riverbeds, as \\"faint and elusive as Martian canals\\" when seen in satellite photos, some that haven't born water on the surface for thousands of years; salt flats; dried lake beds; immense, grim gravel plains, utterly without feature; and massive mountain ranges, often the refuge of nomad groups, not unlike islands in the sea that is the Sahara.  <br /> <br /> The authors point to the ample evidence that the Sahara was not always desert, notably the stands of petrified wood in Algeria, Niger, and Chad and the curious calcified reeds that once grew around now extinct lakes, odd glasslike structures that mark long vanished shorelines. In actuality the region in the last several tens of thousands of years has alternated between desert and moister climes, changing back and forth due to the complex mechanics of global climate and changes in the Earth's orbit. The writers discussed the waxing and waning of the desert (apparently some areas were always arid) over the millennia as well as debates about whether or not the desert is expanding south. <br /> <br /> Sand itself is well covered in this book, the authors providing vivid examples of ruins, buildings, and entire towns lost to migrating dunes. The origins of Saharan sand, the physics of dune formation, the various types of dunes, and how one travels through these areas are all discussed.  <br /> <br /> The chapter on Saharan weather was especially interesting. The most powerful wind is the harmattan, known as the sirocco in Algeria, called by some Tuareg and Tubu clans the shahali or shai-halad or mother of storms, a wind so powerful it has been known to send powdery fine sand up to 500 miles distant, as far as England and northern Germany. In the desert its effects can be quite devastating; ninety-plus mile an hour winds, huge electrical disturbances, drops in humidity to 10 percent, and of course massive, frightening sandstorms. <br /> <br />  Saharan wind systems are so strong that their effects are global; fully grown grasshoppers have been deposited in Antigua. Between 60 million and a billion tons of iron-rich sand blows across the ocean each year, in some cases beneficial (important for the nourishment of upper canopy orchids in the Amazon) but more often troublesome (it has been linked to the declining health of coral in the Caribbean and creating huge blooms of toxic red tide in Florida waters). <br /> <br /> As dry as the Sahara is, water still exists. In addition to the mighty Nile and the Niger, massive deposits of \\"fossil water,\\" laid down when the region was moister, would rival the American Great Lakes if they were on the surface. Yields from wells in some areas can be quite high - up to 25,000 cubic feet of water per hour - but there is considerable debate over whether this is a renewable resource or not. Some believe that these ancient aquifers are being renewed more frequently and at a greater volume than previously estimated, a theory that is discussed. <br /> <br /> As noted mountains exist; the enormous Ahaggar Mountains cover an area as big as France, while the spectacular Air mountains cover an area the size of Switzerland. The mountains are fascinating regions, home to intricately carved rock, secretive mountain people, and in the Tibesti Mountains, still active volcanoes.  <br /> <br /> There is an overview of some of the animals of this harsh realm. Some of the more spectacular have vanished thanks to man - elephants were found near Timbuktu as late as 1787, but were since hunted out, while ostriches vanished from Algeria early in the 20th century and hartebeests from Morocco in World War II. Ostriches - and leopards - still survive in some areas, as well as dwarf crocodiles in remote oases, the striped hyena, huge tortoises in the Sudan, monitor lizards, jerboas, fennec foxes, caracals, sand vipers, addax (the desert's largest mammal), and scorpions (much more hazardous and common than any desert snake). <br /> <br /> Early history of man in the Sahara is covered, including the famous rock art.  Also, the rise and fall of the various empires of the region are discussed, including the Garamantes, Mali, and Songhai. I will have to say this was probably the driest part of the book, as some of the intrigue and various dynasties got a bit confusing at times. <br /> <br /> There is excellent coverage of the various nomadic groups present today; the Bedouin, the Moors, the Tubu, the Chaamba, the Berbers, and in particular the fascinating Tuareg.  <br /> <br /> The final parts of the book look at Saharan commerce and travel, examining the routes taken by caravans, the nature of caravans themselves, and the chief commodities that are bought and sold. Also great information on the all-important camel, an animal that arguably without which there would have been no Saharan civilization. The long vital salt and gold trades are well examined (the salt trade is particularly interesting), but regrettably the most profitable element of Saharan commerce was the slave trade. Until well into the 19th century half the value of Saharan traffic was in slaves. Even more unfortunately, slavery still exists; in many areas slaves weren't officially freed until the late 1960s, though unofficially they are still kept. Slavery was outlawed in Mauritania in 1980 but upwards of one hundred thousand are still slaves.  <br />	2005-06-12

I however found it very entertaining, even funny at times, and also extremely informative and boasting a wealth of illustrations. The author had an engaging writing style, weaving in stories of his personal life (some only marginally related to cockroaches, though all were quite engrossing).  <br /> <br /> There are a great variety of roach species in the world, though not all of them are pests. The most famous of course are the pest species, including the most common domestic cockroach in the U.S, the German cockroach, (_Blattella germanica_), and the second most common, the American cockroach (_Periplaneta americana_), both the main subjects of the book.  Other pest species in North America include the oriental cockroach, brown-banded roach (noted for colonizing appliances), and the smokey-brown, though there are 64 other species on the continent far from the haunts of man. More than 5,000 species of cockroach are known in the order Blattaria (from the Greek word blattae, for roach). Only about a hundred species worldwide occur around humans at all; most live unseen, generally in hot humid jungles though they are found virtually everywhere on Earth.  <br /> <br /> Schweid went into a great deal of detail exploring roach anatomy, physiology, pheromones (including not only mating pheromones but interestingly aggregation and dispersal pheromones), daily habits, and mating behavior, much of it fascinating reading. One learns the early warning system for roaches is not their antennae; it is a pair of feelers called the cerci, located on the backside near the anus, covered in hundreds of remarkably fine and sensitive hairs, each only 0.5 millimeters long and 0.005 millimeters wide (this is what lets them scurry away so fast when the lights come on!).  <br /> <br />Roaches have had a long history with humanity, traveling with humans to every spot on the globe. They were particularly fond of traveling by ship, and historical records have shown people such as the Sir Francis Drake, Captain Bligh, and others having contended with them. Interesting, the word cockroach itself is a relative newcomer; while they have long been known to humanity (the Romans for instance called them lucifuga, for their habit of avoiding light), the word did not appear until Europeans began traveling the world. \\"Cockroach\\" as a term first appeared in the 1500s to describe not long familiar pests but new ones noticed from sojourns in Africa and elsewhere (the first written use in the English language came from Captain John Smith of Pocahontas fame in 1624). The two most famous in the U.S. are not natives; the German cockroach is thought native to north Africa, spread by the Phoenicians to Europe and then from there throughout Russia and eventually the Americas, while the American cockroach (sometimes euphemistically called the \\"water bug\\") is thought to have come directly from Africa on slave ships.   <br /> <br />Along the way Schweid chronicled the numerous ways the cockroach has entered various cultures, ranging from their role as the \\"Trickster\\" in Caribbean folktales to the famous song \\"La Cucaracha\\" (originating with Pancho Villa's soldiers, about a roach missing its two back legs, a song with many versions), to the writings of Franz Kafka, to the 1997 movie _Mimic_.  <br /> <br /> The association with roaches has not been a wanted one, as they have been known to be vectors of many diseases, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and even hookworms and tapeworms. They have been known to be more direct threats; people have gone to emergency rooms when roaches became lodged in their ear, and roaches have been known to partially consume human fingernails, toenails, and skin. Also, they sometimes feed on human corpses, causing such damage at times that forensics experts have mistaken damage caused by roaches as wounds sustained by the deceased while alive.   <br /> <br />The war against cockroaches has gone on for millennia. Over the centuries there have been numerous ways used to combat them. An Egyptian papyrus was found with a prayer to the ram-headed god Khnum for protection from roaches, and the Greek scholar Diophanes recommended ways to rid homes of roach infestations.  Sailors were once given rewards, either bottles of brandy or shore leave, for turning in specified numbers of roach bodies and sometimes kept on board monkeys or lemurs to hunt and eat roaches.  <br /> <br /> Today fighting roaches is big business; there are estimates that as much as $240 million a year is spent in the U.S. on control of roaches, with the city of New York alone spending half a million dollars a year on insecticides. Schweid chronicled much of the research into controlling them and the debates over whether to use sprays or baits. The war has taken a special significance as studies have shown a very strong linkage between asthma and allergies to cockroaches. As asthma appears to be on the rise - a 60% increase in the last decade, particularly among poor African-American males - this is very important.  <br /> <br /> Roaches are of course famous survivors and Schweid provided numerous examples of this. The American cockroach for instance can survive 90 days without food, and 40 days without food or water. They eat a tremendous variety of items, with the pest species known to consume glue, hair, paper, leather, banana skins, and feces. There are 14 breaking points on the legs, cerci, and antennae of the German cockroach, which, if grabbed by a predator, they can pull away and leave the enemy with just an appendage, one replaced at the next molt.  <br /> <br /> As much a pest as some species of roach have been, they have actually served mankind. The American cockroach has long been a favorite laboratory animal thanks to its substantial size, abundance, ease of care, and exemption from any laws governing the use of lab animals. Work on roaches gave birth to the field of neuroendocrinology and was important in early studies of circadian rhythms.  <br />	2005-06-06
US	52590451	R1SGI5BN40W1E3	0198564805	949652347	Light and Life	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Excellent exploration of the interaction of light and life	_Light and Life_ by Michael Gross is a brief overview of a variety of instances in which light - from the Sun and other sources - and life on Earth have interacted. A rather short book - not counting the suggestions for further reading it, is 149 pages - I found it an enjoyable, quick read. Though at times it got a bit technical, for the most part it was accessible and interesting. <br /> <br /> After a brief preface describing some very general observations as to why light is important in understanding life on Earth and as to why the author decided to explore this topic, the author divided the book into six chapters, each with a different focus. <br /> <br /> The first chapter really dealt with astronomy rather than with biology. In this section Gross explored the Big Bang, the origins of stars, the formation of the solar system, and the structure and functioning of the Sun. I found this chapter pretty general, mostly things I had read before, though a good overview. I did find his discussion of the left over radiation from the early universe, the cosmic microwave background, or CMB, interesting. Though its existence was predicted in 1948 by physicist George Gamow, it was only discovered 17 years later by accident, when Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Laboratories were trying to determine the source of the excessive background radiation picked up by a microwave antenna that they had designed to receive satellite transmissions. A two-page discussion on neutrinos, while a bit off-topic, was also quite interesting, where the reader will learn about the massive devices built underground in attempts to observe these elusive and extremely difficult to detect particles that come from our Sun and other stars. <br /> <br /> The second chapter was much more in line with the book's title, dealing with photosynthesis, including its evolution, the effects it has had on the geology, climate, and evolution of life on this planet, and how it is accomplished at the chemicallevel (this latter subject did get a bit technical but there were some helpful diagrams). Also discussed is the ozone layer, its formation, its importance to life, and the threats posed to it by pollution (with some discussion as to why certain pollutants interact with ozone).  <br /> <br /> Chapter three was quite interesting, veering away from the Sun and Sun-related topics, focusing instead on the world of bioluminescent organisms. One interesting point he made, when discussing ecosystems that form around hydrothermal vents, seemingly independent of the Sun, is that ultimately they still benefit from photosynthesis due to their reliance on oxygen, which is present in usable quantities thanks to the activities of photosynthetic organisms. <br /> <br /> Gross made many interesting observations about bioluminescence. It is found in a rather diverse group of organisms with little apparent rhyme or reason. It is fairly common in the ocean, virtually absent in freshwater. Various groups of worms and insects can glow, but no spiders. Among vertebrates, only fish use it. There appears to be 30 non-related bioluminescent systems in nature, possibly meaning 30 separate incidents of independent evolution. Gross discussed the idea put forth by William D. McElroy and H. H. Seliger that originally the first such system did not evolve to produce light but rather to detoxify the oxygen that was introduced into the atmosphere by cyanobacteria (as most bioluminescent systems use oxygen). Later on, mitochondria were able to use and dispose of the oxygen much more effectively.  <br /> <br /> The book explored how light is produced in organisms and its many possible uses, including seeing, sexual signaling, alarm signals, bait, to deceive predators, and, what was interesting to me, \\"no use.\\" Sometimes light appears to be an unwanted byproduct or at least produced for little understood reasons, such as is the case with luminescent fungi. <br /> <br /> The many uses of bioluminescenceby humans were explored. One interesting use related to detecting landmines; all landmines leak small quantities of TNT; researchers have developed a strain of bacteria (one that naturally feeds on this chemical) so that it would glow under a UV lamp. <br /> <br /> Chapter four explored biological clocks and movement guided by light, including photokinesis (light causing increased activity), phototaxis (light being an attractive signal to which an organism will run towards, phototaxis affecting both orientation and displacement of an organism), and phototropism (as when a plant grows or bends towards light). Also discussed in this chapter was the importance of sunlight to human health physically and psychologically. Interesting was a discussion as why peoples native to the tropics have darker skin; it has nothing to do with skin cancer, which only develops late in life, well beyond their reproductive age. Rather, it has to do with vitamin D synthesis (dark skin and low light would make for problems) and the destruction of folic acid (less often damaged in dark skinned people). <br /> <br /> Chapter five was quite interesting, dealing with the evolution and structure of eyes in the animal kingdom, though largely focusing on the human eye. I learned many things I did not know, including about why cataracts form, color blindness (first systematically analyzed by an individual who suffered from it, John Dalton, more famous for the modern concept of the atom), saccades and trans-saccadic memory (saccades are rapid eye movements performed unaware to us up to three times a second, and the trans-saccadic memory creates continuity between images before and after a saccade, though studies have shown very interestingly that this memory is more schematic than detail-oriented; fascinating reading), and binocular rivalry (what happens when the eyes are presented with two separate, incompatible images, resulting not in a blending of the images or two images but rather an alteration of two competing images at apparently random time intervals, though this is to some extent influenced by conscious thought). <br /> <br /> The final chapter was one of the briefest, providing some highlights of Sun worship through the ages and past thinking about light and vision. We've come a long way from the ancient Greek philosopher Empedocles' idea of \\"vision rays.\\"  <br />	2005-06-04
US	52590451	R3GLHTM60F78FC	0387952896	293584016	Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe	Books	5	21	25	N	Y	Outstanding popular astronomy and paleontology writing	_Rare Earth_ by Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee is an excellent, thorough, and thought provoking work analyzing the possibility of life on other worlds. Ward, a noted paleontologist, and Brownlee, an astronomer, sought to challenge the widespread notion that complex, even intelligent, life is common in the universe. This bias towards believing in intelligent life elsewhere is partly thanks to wishful thinking (aided by works of science fiction) and partly from the famous Drake Equation put forth by astronomers Frank Drake and Carl Sagan. This equation, one designed to estimate the number of advanced civilizations present in our galaxy, was based on educated guesses on how many planets there were in our galaxy, how many of those might harbor life, and of those what percentage advanced to become homes of civilized life forms. Using the best estimates at the time, Drake and Sagan in 1974 postulated that a million civilizations may exist in the Milky Way galaxy alone, and as our galaxy is but one of hundreds of millions of galaxies, according to them the number of intelligent alien species must be staggering. <br /> <br /> Ward and Brownlee did not think that credible, and put forth an alternative theory, the Rare Earth Hypothesis, using information gathered over the years in paleontology, geology, climatology, and astronomy. In a nutshell, they believe that microbial life is very common in the universe, perhaps more common than even Drake and Sagan anticipated, while complex life - animals and higher plants - is quite rare.  <br /> <br /> As evidence exists that life first appeared on Earth 3.8 billion years ago, almost simultaneously with the end of heavy bombardment from outer space and the lowering of surface temperatures below the boiling point of water, it is possible that life could form very early on a planet, that it can and quite possibly will evolve on any planet if conditions are at least just barely tolerable. Additionally, with evidence that on Earth there are microbes that can survive temperatures above boiling water, as much as 169 degrees Celsius (and maybe up to 200), deep in the Earth's crust or in hydrothermal deep sea vents (as well as life found living in sea ice and snow), it would appear that microorganisms have very wide tolerances for a range of planetary conditions. Given that many believe life may have first evolved deep underground or deep beneath the sea, the authors feel that microorganisms may be quite common, perhaps even present elsewhere in our own solar system.  <br /> <br /> Conversely, the conditions that allow animal and advanced plant life to develop (the authors largely concentrate on animals) are \\"rare if not unique,\\" Earth being a \\"bastion of animals amid a sea of microbe-infested worlds.\\" Ward and Brownlee have composed a long list of \\"low-probability\\" events or conditions that are necessary for the formation of animal life.  <br /> <br /> I had long been familiar with the concept that Earth was lucky to be at just the right distance from its star, in the habitable zone, a region where heat from the sun provides a planetary surface temperature at which water neither freezes nor boils (the authors later narrow this concept to the animal habitable zone, the range of distances where not only is it possible for an Earth-like planet to have liquid surface water but also to maintain average global temperatures of less than 50 degree Celsius, as that is believed the upper limit at which animal life can exist). What was new to me was the concept of the galactic habitable zone, the notion being that complex life can only develop (and survive) on a planet in the right neighborhood of the galaxy basically, and indeed the right type of galaxy period. Earth-life as we know it could not arise at all if the sun was in a globular cluster, an elliptical galaxy, or a small galaxy, as most if not all stars in these formations are too metal-poor and often are too hot for life on inner planets. In systemslow in metals (elements other than hydrogen and helium), there would not be enough solid matter to form a planet the size of Earth and even if one formed it would lack the metals needed to produce either magnetic fields or the internal heat sources to drive plate tectonics.  <br /> <br />Even in suitable galaxies an Earth-like planet could not exist in its center, as that is a region with many energetic processes that could eliminate life altogether; the high density of stars in the center make the danger of supernovae significant (our sun and planet are protected simply by the relative scarcity of stars around us). Other stellar members, such as neutron stars called magnetars, are considerably more common in the center (which can emit vast amounts of lethal X-rays and gamma rays). Nor could Earth exist at the galactic edge, as that region is too metal poor.  <br /> <br />The authors argued that plate tectonics is vital to the development of animal life for a variety of reasons. It promotes high levels of biodiversity, a major defense against mass extinctions; it provides the planet with a global thermostat by recycling chemicals essential in keeping the volume of carbon dioxide relatively uniform (and thus enabling liquid water to remain on a planet's surface); it creates the continents (not only vital for biodiversity purposes but also in terms of weathering and as source of marine nutrients); and it provides a magnetic field, a defense against lethal cosmic radiation and the loss of an atmosphere.  <br /> <br />There are a number of other factors that the authors look at; among them the importance of the Moon (extremely vital but perhaps a very rare thing for one of that size to exist around a terrestrial planet), the importance of a stable Jupiter at the right distance from Earth, and several perhaps unique events in Earth's history, such as Snowball Earth episodes and the Cambrian Explosion, vital events in the evolution of life that might be very unlikely to occur on an alien planet.  <br />	2005-05-31

Most of the essays in the book were originally published in a Swedish version, which were then translated by Erik H. Friis, and then rewritten, updated, and expanded for this book by the author (the Swedish version is copyright 1981, while this work is copyright 1986). A number of black and white drawings by Hubert Pepper accompany the book.  The book is 117 pages long and was a quick read; I read it in a day. <br /> <br /> A rather enjoyable, for the most part easy to read book, the first four essays dealt with the author's opinions about the world of science as a whole, contrasting it with the world of pseudoscience. Along the way Kurten attacked some of the more egregious examples of pseudoscience, such as several Nazi \\"scientists\\", the Soviet \\"geneticist\\" Trofim Lysenko, Creationism (which he dealt with only very briefly), and the Swedish writer Ivan Troeng, who wrote a book claiming that the moon originated in the Pacific Ocean 11,800 years ago as a result of collision between the Earth and a smaller celestial body. Kurten disliked the fact that pseudoscientists point to individuals who truly revolutionized their fields, like Darwin, Mendel, and Galileo, and when the pseudoscientists offer their revolutionary ideas and are rejected by mainstream science, claim that they are being persecuted just as these individuals were (Kurten asserted that simply so much more is known that a true and utter revolution is just not possible anymore). Additionally, Kurten pointed out that the pseudoscientist sets out to prove something; he or she has a preconceived notion of what really exists, and unlike a real scientist his or her mind is closed to alternative possibilities. By way of contrast Kurten provided an example of a successful revolution, of a theory that was met with a lot of skepticism at first but was later accepted, that of plate tectonics.  <br /> <br /> The remaining chapters dealt more specifically with issues and ideas in paleontology, with essays on the geological and paleontological history of the Mediterranean Sea (which I thought was a bit too brief), ancient natural oil spills, the science and politics of _Archaeopteryx_, the process whereby mammoths and other Pleistocene mammals were preserved more or less intact, and the first Europeans (I found that chapter a bit technical).  <br /> <br /> One of my favorite chapters dealt with an unusual 20 million year old fossil, that of a Miocene rhinoceros of the genus _Diceratherium_, discovered in 1935 in Grant County, Washington state. The fossil was found by hikers, who thought at first that they had found a very odd cave with some bone fragments. Upon investigation it was discovered that the cave was a mold of an extinct rhinoceros, one apparently formed when flowing lava engulfed the (apparently bloated) carcass of the animal, a mold not unlike those found at Pompeii. Kurten discussed how the lava was able to preserve this form without igniting the body and what was learned from the fossil (the wrinkles and folds of the skin were even preserved).  <br /> <br /> Another chapter I enjoyed was one on Piltdown Man, without a doubt the most famous forgery in the history of paleontology (if not science as a whole). Not particularly familiar with this history of this controversy, it was interesting to learn that even when the fossil was first produced it was not immediately accepted. \\"Dualists\\" believed that the braincase belong to a man and the lower jaw to that of an ape, while \\"monists,\\" who believed it, pointed out that no anthropoid ape was known from Pleistocene Europe and that teeth were worn down in the same way as found in humans. Even after the famous second Piltdown \\"discovery\\" (\\"Piltdown II\\") and before the specimen was dated using fluorine content, there were problems accepting the Piltdown Man as real; originally it was thought in hominids that thebrain evolved first, then the teeth and jaws, but instead _Australopithecus_ proved that this was just the opposite, that it had human-like teeth but a brain closer to that of an ape. Piltdown Man just didn't fit in. Kurten in the end debunked every find associated with Piltdown Man, even the idea that the fossils could have been found there in the first place; it was later shown that the chemical properties of the Piltdown gravel were not conducive to fossil formation and preservation. <br /> <br /> Another interesting chapter dealt with Neandertals. Kurten speculated that the prominent eyebrow ridges had evolved to give the Neandertals an intimidating glare, a threatening glance to frighten other organisms, a feature not unlike the false eyes developed by some defenseless animals such as several butterfly species.  <br /> <br /> The chapter on cave art was excellent and was accompanied by a number of illustrations. Kurten mentioned in passing that the larva of a gadfly is one of the animals found represented in a particular cave; a small figurine made from jet of a larvae was discovered. This may have represented one of the animals eaten by man at the time, as these larvae, which are found inside the skin of reindeer, are a delicacy among modern Inuit. Kurten discussed the role cave art played and discussed their possible religious and magical purposes (briefly mentioning that the term cave art may be a misnomer, that likely the late Pleistocene landscape was \\"studded with pictures\\" not unlike highway billboards, with art placed on rock walls, tree trunks, and boulders). Kurten favored the notion that it may have been used for instructional purpose for children, noting that the animals were often rendered with very precise detail, so precise that it took zoologists to notice it (for instance animals clearly in heat were depicted), and that it was produced for its own enjoyment (noting the many very erotic depictions of women, something generally passed over in popular surveys, a few of which were produced here and are not for kids).  <br />	2005-05-26

McNeill is an absolutely brilliant work of history; though originally published in 1977 it is still insightful and influential. Just as Brian Fagan in _The Long Summer_ viewed human history through the prism of climatic change, McNeill in this work showed how the world got to be the way it is in large part thanks to disease. How the various communities of humans in the world came to an accommodation with those infectious diseases that were able to reach epidemic proportions, when and whether or not a disease went from a being epidemic to endemic (milder, generally a childhood disease) in a given population, was a major factor in world history and one that was often overlooked.  According to McNeill, for too long the role of infectious disease in world history has not been properly taken into account, historians for many decades viewing epidemics as \\"accidents\\" and infection (and fear of infection) often having been treated as \\"unpredictable\\" and \\"incomprehensible,\\" as disease \\"spoiled the web of interpretation and explanation\\" that historians used to understand the human experience. McNeill sought to chronicle man's history with infectious disease and the far-reaching consequences that resulted when contacts across disease boundaries allowed a new infection to invade a population that had no acquired immunity to its effects.  The contemporary global diffusion of childhood diseases such as measles, mumps, and until recently smallpox took thousands of years, a history well covered in this book.  <br /> <br /> It was due to a near lack of disease that humanity was able to multiple vastly between 40,000 and 10,000 B.C; as humans left the tropical environment of Africa, it left behind not only diseases that were endemic to the environment that had kept mankind in check but additionally moved into non-tropical environments that were not as benign for many parasites (McNeill often referred to infectious diseases as microparasites or simply parasites). The biological checks on humankind in sub-Saharan Africa were absent in temperate and northern climates, with lower temperatures and oftentimes drier conditions inimical to many parasites and with fewer organisms present to become possible parasites. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, humanity began to reverse this relative lack of disease with the advent of agriculture. By multiplying a restricted number of species - both animal and human- dense concentrations of potential food for parasites were created. Weed species arose to fill in the gaps created by such huge distortions in normal ecological systems. Many weeds - such as plant weeds and mice - were relatively easy to control, but microorganisms for centuries defied understanding and control. Most if not all of these microorganisms jumped to humans from livestock, and as parasites that pass directly from human to human with no intermediate host and indeed cannot survive without a large pool of non-immune humans, are \\"rank newcomers\\" in terms of the evolution of life on Earth. These diseases are the hallmarks of civilization.  <br /> <br />The \\"domestication\\" of disease that occurred between 1300 and 1700 was a major landmark in world history, the direct result of two great transportation revolutions, one on land initiated by the Mongols and one on sea initiated by the Europeans during the age of exploration. When diseases first appear they are often spectacularly fatal, so lethal that it is possible for a microorganism to die out locally or even completely. Only after a period of time has passed can hosts and parasites adjust to one another, as the disease becomes a normal, endemic, more or less stable part of civilized society, a relationship less destructive to human hosts and more secure for the parasites, the latter able to count on a fresh supply of susceptible children to infect. Only with continued exposure can a population hope to develop this balance, as older individuals acquire immunity to the disease, reinforced by repeated exposure. Paradoxically, the more diseased a community, the less destructive are its epidemics, as adults are less likely to die, adults being more difficult to replace then infants and more damaging to society when they do perish. The more communications spread between Europe, North America, and the rest of the world, the smaller became the chance of any really devastating disease encounter. Only a radical mutation of an existing disease-causing organism or a new transfer from some other host to humans offered the possibility of any devastating epidemic as the world became one disease pool. Former separate disease pools, once separated by major geographical barriers - mountains, deserts, and oceans - converged into one disease pool as no large group of humans remained isolated from the rest of humanity by the end of the 19th century. To McNeill, a disease regime that he called modern existed only after \\"endemicity\\" spread throughout the world, first from port city to port city and then filtering into rural towns and the countryside. It was only after the endemicity of the major childhood diseases - their domestication - occurred that population growth really began to occur worldwide, that cities no longer needed a constant influx of rural migrants to replace large numbers of deaths each year (amazingly this only happened finally in 1900). <br />  <br /> In addition to the history of disease and its effects other related topics are covered, such as the development of modern urban sewer systems (thanks in large part to cholera), how changes in agricultural practices affected disease propagation and spread (ironically while many diseases spread from cattle to humans it was the presence of large number of cattle that interrupted the chain of malarial transmission in much of Europe), the advent of modern doctors, acceptance of the germ theory of disease, and the development of vaccines. It was very interesting to learn that Edward Jenner did not invent vaccination; while his role was very important, smallpox inoculation at a folk level existed for hundreds of years in Arabia, North Africa, Persia, India, and China.  Also the coverage of bubonic plague, leprosy, and syphilis is especially good in this book, the sections on it making for fascinating reading.  <br />	2005-05-24

Fagan expanded his focus greatly in _The Long Summer_ as in this work he analyzed the effects of various climatic events since 18,000 B.C. on the course of Stone Age life, early farming societies, and the evolution of civilizations in Europe, southwest Asia, north Africa, and the Americas, covering climatically-influenced human history from the settlement of the Americas to the origins of the Sumerians to the conquest of Gaul by Rome (which was fascinating) through the end of the Mayan and Tiwanaku civilizations (in Central and South America respectively). As in _The Little Ice Age_, Fagan dismissed both those who discounted the role climatic change had played in transforming human societies and those who believed in environmental determinism (the notion that climate change was the primary cause of major developments in human civilization).  <br /> <br /> Fagan provided many examples of climatic change affecting human history. Between 13,000 and 8,000 B.C. Europe became covered in forest thanks to warming climates and retreating glaciers. This climatic change - and resulting alteration in the ecology of the region - lead to the extinction of the large and medium-sized herd animals that were the favored prey of the Cro-Magnons (such as the mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, giant deer, and reindeer) and their replacement by smaller, generally more dispersed game like red deer, wild boar, and aurochs. Not only did this change in fauna lead to a change in hunting techniques, it also lead to an increased reliance on plant food and in general a much broader diet that included nuts, seeds, tubers, fruit, and fungi. Other changes included increased mobility - and the end of cave art, as tribes and bands were no longer attached to certain areas - andthe development of the bow and arrow, much more effective in dense forest against solitary, skittish prey.  <br /> <br /> While Europeans adjusted to a world without megafauna, by 11,000 B.C. a group known as the Kebarans became dependent upon a relatively moist area of oak and pistachio forests that extended from modern Israel through Lebanon and into much of modern Syria. Though not developing agriculture per se, as they did not plant crops but rather relied on wild plants, they nevertheless developed some of the early signs of agriculture, such as pestles, mortars, and other tools to process the seeds and nuts that they harvested, the Kebarans relying on the millions of acorns and pistachios that they collected each year, supplemented by wild grass seeds and wild gazelles.  <br /> <br />While the development of permanent Kebaran villages anchored to groves of nut-bearing trees and grass stands was a response to climatic and ecological changes brought on by the end of the Ice Age, their eventual end was also largely brought upon by the onset of a series of intense droughts thanks to a remarkable and seemingly distant event around 11,000 B.C.; the draining of the immense Lake Agassiz, a huge meltwater lake that lapped the retreating Laurentide ice sheet for 1,100 km in modern day Canada and the U.S. The lake rose so much that it eventually burst its banks and flooded into what is now Lake Superior and then onto to the Labrador Sea. So much Agassiz meltwater floated atop the dense, salty Gulf Stream that for ten centuries that conveyor of warm, moist air to Europe ceased, among other things plunging southwestern Asia into a thousand year drought. This drought eliminated the groves that the Kebarans depended upon, ending their prehistoric society, though not before the first experiments with cultivating wild grasses. Eventually villages arose that existed primarily dependent and then completely dependent upon cereal agriculture, on grain crops planted and harvestedby the people themselves. In such places as Abu Hureyra in modern Syria full-fledged farming arose by 9500 B.C. as a response to drought, to the end of the oak-pistachio belt and the decline of game.  <br /> <br /> Just as drought lead to early experiments with pre-agricultural communities and then to the actual cultivation of grains, it may have also lead to the domestication of wild goats and sheep in southwestern Asia and of cattle in what would become the Sahara Desert. The arid conditions for instance in southwestern Asia between 11,000 and 9500 B.C. lead to a concentration of game and of humans around the increasingly few permanent water sources, an event that would allow hunters to intimately know individual herds, even individual animals, allowing for these ancient humans to learn how to control the few key members of herds, to selectively cull undesirable members to change the characteristics of that herd's offspring, and how to eventually capture and pen some or all of the herd for later consumption. <br /> <br /> It was amazing to me how different the climate and terrain of ancient man truly was. Those who discount the effects of climatic change upon human history should consider how different the world of 6200 BC was. In this year - the time of the famed flat-roofed settlement of Catalhoyuk in central Turkey - farmers lived on the shores of the vast, brackish Euxine Lake to the north of the Anatolian plateau (what would become the Black Sea) and the Laurentide glacier was still retreating in northern Canada. In this year (more or less) began what has been called the Mini Ice Age as vast amounts of Laurentide meltwater suppressed the Gulf Stream, plunged Europe into colder and drier conditions, produced a profound drought in the Mediterranean, and caused ocean waters to rise so that Britain was finally severed from the continent.  <br /> <br /> Also quite interesting were the several prehistoric societies Fagan touched upon, such as the Kebarans, the `Ubaid people of 5800 B.C. southern Mesopotamia (they predate the Sumerians), the Linearbandkeramik communities of 5600 B.C. Europe, and the early fifth millennium B.C. Badarians of the Nile Valley, groups I was completely unfamiliar with.  <br />	2005-05-16

Despite the name, the Little Ice Age (a term coined by glacial geologist Francois Matthes in 1939, a term he used in a very informal way and without capitalized letters) was not a time of unrelenting cold. Rather, it was an era of dramatic climatic shifts, cycles of intensely cold winters and easterly winds alternating with periods of heavy spring and early summer rains, mild winters, and frequent and often devastating Atlantic storms as well as periods of droughts, light northeasterly winds, and intense summer heat. The Little Ice Age was \\"an endless zigzag of climatic shifts,\\" few lasting more than 25 years or so.   <br /> <br /> Nevertheless the climate of the time proved difficult and overall was uniformly cooler, often considerably so, than the time before and afterwards. The Little Ice Age was an era when there used to be winter fairs on the frozen River Thames during the time of King Charles II, one that produced the great gales that devastated the Spanish Armada in 1588, was when George Washington's Continental Army endured a brutal winter in Valley Forge in 1777-1778, when pack ice surrounded Iceland for much of the year, when Alpine glaciers destroyed villages and advanced kilometers from their present positions,  when hundreds of poor died of hypothermia regularly every winter in London late into the 19th century. It was also a time of massive rainy periods, such as the immense rains of 1315 and 1316 that helped stop the armies of French King Louis X from crushing the rebellious Flemings and produced an immense famine as crops couldn't survive the near unending rain.  <br /> <br /> Piecing together the climatic history of the Little Ice Age has been a challenge, one that required a multidisciplinary approach. Fagan recountedhow reliable instrument records only go back a few centuries and then primarily only for Europe and North America. Researchers have instead relied on information obtained from tree rings, ice cores, lake and marine bottom sediment cores, wine harvest records, analysis of the weather portrayed in art of the period, and anecdotal written records of country clergymen and gentleman scientists to piece together what the weather was like during the time period.  <br /> <br /> Although the causes of the Little Ice Age are not completely understood, much of it had to do with the actions of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a \\"seesaw\\" of atmospheric pressure between a persistent high over the Azores and an equally prevalent low over Iceland. Using charts and maps, Fagan showed how the NAO governs the position and strength of the North Atlantic storm track and thus Europe's rainfall. The NAO index shows the constant shifts in the oscillation between these two areas, with a high NAO index indicating low pressure around Iceland and high pressure in the Azores, a condition producing westerly winds, powerful storms, more summer rains, mild winters, and dry conditions in southern Europe. A low NAO index signaled high pressure around Iceland, low pressure in the Azores, weaker westerlies, much colder winters, with cold air flowing from the north and east. The exact reasons for the shifts in the NAO result from a complex interaction between sea-surface temperatures, the Gulf Stream, distribution of sea ice, and solar energy output. Additionally, several massive volcanic eruptions had an effect on the climate of the time, notably Soufriere on Saint Vincent in the Caribbean in 1812, Mayon in the Philippines in 1814, and the titanic Tambora eruption in Indonesia in 1815 (the latter with one hundred times the ash output of Mount Saint Helens).  <br /> <br /> The author noted that placing the climatic events of the Little Ice Age in a proper context in terms of human history has been subject to some debate. Many archaeologists and historians are suspicious of environmental determinism, of the notion that climate change alone was the reason for such major developments as agriculture or a particular war. However, others had felt that climate had played very little or no role in human history, and that Fagan completely rejects, primarily because throughout the Little Ice Age (even as late as the 19th century), millions of European peasants lived at the subsistence level, their survival dependent totally upon crop yields, generally what they themselves grew on land they owned or rented. It was centuries before even parts of Europe (at first the Netherlands and Britain) developed modern specialized commercial agriculture (with intensive farming and growing of nitrogen-enriching plants and animal fodder on previously fallow land) and reasonably reliable transportation networks to distribute food to larger areas. During most of Europe for the Little Ice Age, cycles of good and bad harvests, of cooler and wetter springs, meant the difference between hunger and plenty. This sufficiency or insufficiency of food was a powerful motivator for human action.  Fagan wrote that while environmental determinism may be \\"intellectually bankrupt,\\" climate change is the \\"ignored player on the historical stage.\\"  <br /> <br /> Fagan recounted several times when the climate of the Little Ice Age played an important role in the historical events of the time. For instance while Flanders and the Netherlands in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and England in Stuart times really began to modernize agriculture, little innovation occurred in France, with late eighteenth century French agriculture very little different from medieval agriculture, leaving millions of poor farmers and city dwellers at the edge of starvation and at the mercy of the vagaries of climate. While the decision to not modernize rested in the hands of the nobility (who were uninterested) and in thepeasants (who were often deeply suspicious of change and wedded to tradition), it was the climatic events of the late eighteen century that lead to the awful harvest of 1788, the politicization of the rural poor, and the path to the French Revolution.  <br />	2005-05-08

In microevolution, biologists can follow the process of natural selection; as every generation of a species produces a line of variants, some of these variants do better than others and survive to possibly pass on those variant traits to their offspring. Biologists can for instance track the success (and failure) of individual genes or how a particular species of insect adapts to a new pesticide. Macroevolution on the other hand works on much larger, grander scales, a scale in which completely new types of bodies appear. <br /> <br /> Zimmer sought to examine macroevolution in the development of tetrapods from fish (which occurred between 380 and 360 million years ago) and whales from land mammals (occurring about 50 million years ago), using these fascinating accounts to introduce to the reader two of the most common features of macroevolution - exaptations of existing features and the correlated progression of many different parts.  <br /> <br /> Exaptation is a term used to describe the notion of a structure crafted by evolution for one function and later becoming ideal for another, often completely different function. Early in the 20th century this concept was known as preadaptation, a term coined by Alfred Sherwood Romer, though Stephen Jay Gould and  Elizabeth Vrba in 1982 offered the term exaptation instead as preadaptation seemed to imply some sort of conscious planning for the future that evolution can never have. <br />  <br /> In tetrapod evolution, the production of urea in lobe-fins was an exaptation - originally evolved as a way for an organism to avoid ammonia poisoning, excess salt, and water loss at sea, an excellent system for when tetrapods came ashore. Lungs may have evolved originally not for life on land but to give predatory fish more stamina in chasing prey at sea,  thisability helping keep the heart nourished and allowing the fish to swim longer and harder than fish without lungs. Early tetrapods evolved legs to move along shallow, coastal lagoon bottoms and through flooded forests, not to move onto land, an \\"exaptation of the most dramatic sort.\\"  Among whales, _Ambulocetus_, an ancestor with perhaps a crocodile-like lifestyle, may have evolved the ability to hold its breath while it drowned its prey in deep water, an exaptation for later life at sea. Similarly, the ability of _Ambulocetus_ to hear low-frequency sounds traveling through the ground - as it rested its head on the shore, waiting for prey, the sounds traveling up its bony jaw - may have been an exaptation for hearing underwater.  <br /> <br /> Correlated progression is a bit harder of a concept to explain. Essentially, it is a \\"choreography of changes\\" in an animal. The term, originated by Keith Thomson in the 1960s, describes how one change in a particular aspect of an organism cannot take place unless natural selection was also altering the other parts of the organism for other adaptations at the same time; changes in one part of the body can sometimes make other changes more beneficial to an animal. If anatomical features of an animal are tightly linked together, they will change in concert.  <br /> <br /> The evolution of the tetrapod ear is an excellent example of correlated progression. The stapes in the human ear is homologous with a large bone that supports fish jaws, known as the hyomandibular. The ancestral lobe-fin fish's skull was originally a loose collection of bones held together by ligaments, the hyomandibular serving to brace the upper and lower jawbones against the back of the braincase and also helping to flare open the gill flap to let stale water out of the animal's head. As shown by such fossils as _Acanthostega_, early tetrapods developed a braincase that was fused shut, the jaw being able now to make direct contact with the sturdier skull, thehyomandibular bone no longer needed to support the jaw (and also not needed for working the gills as they became less important for breathing). The hyomandibular shrank and became lodged tightly in the back of the skull, at first locked in so much that it couldn't vibrate freely. Later on other bones of the skull became sturdy enough that the proto-stapes could loosen and begin transmitting sounds to the brain. The stapes could only evolve as a new type of bite was evolving thanks to changes in the skull and in breathing. In turn, the shrinking hyomandibular had its own effects; as the muscles that once connected it to the gill arches now were attached to the jaw to open and shut it and support the head on its shoulders, the dwindling hyomandibular let other bones and muscles create the tetrapod neck. Also, when the shoulders were liberated from the head and from the heavy bone once covering the gills, there was enough room for a bigger, more complex shoulder joint better suited to walking on land.  <br /> <br /> Similarly, the evolution of whale echolocation was a good example of correlated progression, each incremental change in the head of the whale encouraging other changes. Some whales may have accidentally made noises in their nose that, thanks to their echoes, made it easier to hunt prey. Sound may have inadvertently been focused by nose plugs, with whales with oversized nose plugs being favored (the nose plugs evolving into melons). The nose moved up towards the top of the head for easier breathing, but the jaws expanded back to carry it there, which made the whale's skull more stable as it moved back and creating a reflecting dish on the upper jaw for sounds waves coming from the nose as a well as a platform on which the melon to rest.  <br /> <br /> In addition to being a book on the concepts of exaptation and correlated progression, the book can simply be read as an excellent illustrated report of the evolution of tetrapods and whales, with the history of research, accounts of the personalities involved, and speculations on the lifestyles and habitats of early tetrapods and whales.  <br />	2005-04-28

Grinspoon covered the history of human perception of the planet, the observation of Venus by scientists from the ground through the centuries, what the amateur astronomer can see and learn about the planet, the saga of the numerous probes to orbit the planet as well as it enter its atmosphere and even land on its surface, current understandings of the atmosphere and geology of Venus, and speculations on whether or not Venus has or had life and the future of human exploration of the planet. There are two inserts in the book, one a color insert that included a color image of the surface of Venus made by the Soviet _Venera 13_ lander in March 1982 as well as several global and regional topographic maps made by the _Pioneer Venus Orbiter_ and _Magellan_, and a black and white insert which included more Soviet lander images of the ground of Venus as well as numerous close-ups taken by _Magellan_ of a wide variety of Venusian surface features. In the text of the book itself I really liked the various diagrams included, including schematics of the sulfur cycle on Venus and a diagram of typical cloud structure. _Magellan_ images are dominant in the book, an extraordinary space probe that peeled back the \\"bright, unyielding clouds\\" with \\"gentle radar fingers,\\" revealing massive amounts of new information for Venus scientists to ponder and debate over.  <br /> <br /> Venus has long attracted human attention, as it is the brightest object in the night sky after the full moon. Though the planet was noticed by virtually every human culture, no civilization paid it more mind than the Classic Maya (A.D. 300-900). They felt they owed their very existence to Venus (whom they called Kukulcan) - a debt that they paid back in human sacrifices - and based their entire calendar on the 260-day Venus appearance interval. Mayan astronomers were able to chart the appearance, disappearance, and reappearance of Venus in the night skies with incredible accuracy, so much that the Mayan Venus Calendar has an error of only two hours in five hundred years of elapsed time.  <br /> <br /> The \\"solid citadel of clouds\\" that protected Venus from observation made it into a \\"tabula rasa,\\" a blank slate that was inscribed by the wishes and dreams of observers for centuries. Grinspoon documented the many speculations about Venus being a swamp or ocean world, referencing both the serious speculations of astronomers such as Percival Lowell and the flights of fancy of popular literature and film. So little was known about the planet that even its rate of rotation wasn't resolved until 1962, when Earth-based radar images established that one day on Venus equaled 117 Earth days (and that it rotated in a backward or retrograde direction, with the sun rising in the west and setting in the east). Passive radio observations in 1956 that showed the planet emitting massive amounts of microwave radiation lead to the first real understanding of just how hot Venus was, as researchers began to infer that this was heat radiation from the surface, eventually establishing the surface temperature at 900 degrees Fahrenheit (so hot that an observer on the Venusian surface at night could see thanks to the glowing of the red-hot ground).  <br /> <br /> I enjoyed his coverage of the Venusian atmosphere the most of anything in the book. Though the planet-wide cloud cover looks basically bright and featureless even from orbit, images taken with ultraviolet filters have revealed that the atmosphere is dynamic and volatile, an intricate and complex swirl of high-contrast, fast-moving tiny splotches and huge, planet-wide streaks. The identity of this material, so dark in the ultraviolet portion of the spectrum that its it responsible for absorbing nearly half the solar energy received by Venus, is still unknown and is simply called the unknown ultraviolet absorber. Its existence though has allowed scientists to study and model patterns of atmospheric circulation, an atmosphere that at the upper levels circles the planet at 200 miles per hour, circling the planet in four days (dubbed superrotation), while at the same time is virtually motionless at the surface. Explaining this phenomenon has presented another major challenge offered us by Venus, one not yet answered.  <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is unlike anything seen on Earth; immense cloud banks of sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid cover the planet, not very dense and relatively transparent but incredibly vast, towering up to an altitude of 44 miles from the cloud base at 33 miles. They are concentrated into three discrete layers - each layer with a different mixture of droplet sizes - and separated by relatively clear air between. The nature of the droplets in the lowest cloud layer (called Mode 3 droplets) is uncertain, as they are not spherical in shape, may be crystalline, and appear to contain far more chlorine than sulfur (as well as perhaps other substances).  <br /> <br /> Grinspoon gave the reader a tour of the surface, from the \\"continents\\" of Africa-sized Aphrodite Terra along the equator and Australia-sized Ishtar Terra near the north pole to the wide plains to the great variety of volcanoes on the planet, some of which are probably active. Volcanic landforms cover some 90% of the surface, ranging in size from small shield volcanoes (often less than 12 miles across), so numerous that they gather in clusters of a hundred or so in immense shield fields, to odd six to forty mile across pancake dome volcanoes to still larger ones. Many features appear unique to Venus, such as ticks (volcanoes with flanks scalloped by landslides such that the ridges appear to be the jutting legs of an insect), arachnoids (volcanic domes surrounded by spider-web like patterns of fractures and ridges), and anemonae (volcanoes with petal-like lava flows extending outward from them). Other features include the odd circular coronae and intensely deformed areas called tessera.  <br />	2005-04-22

In this book, Diamond discussed the rise of complex human societies in the last 13,000 years, seeking to answer one fundamental question; why did some civilizations come to dominate others? Why did the Fertile Crescent and China for instance develop advanced societies with, as the title suggests, guns, germs, and steel, while other areas of the world, such as Polynesia, Australia, and the Americas, did not? Or in those cases where some civilizations were beginning to acquire such things, why did they get off to such a late start? Why did the Spanish conquer the Incans instead of vice versa? <br /> <br />In a nutshell, he concluded that societies developed differently on different continents not because of racial differences in attitudes or intelligence, but because of differences in continental environments. Advanced technology, centralized political organizations, writing, and professional armies (or simply put the military advantage of simply having large numbers of people), etc. could only emerge in dense, sedentary populations capable of accumulating food surpluses.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, domesticable wild plant and animal species needed for agriculture to arise were very unevenly distributed around the world, with the most valuable species concentrated in only nine small areas of the globe (Southwest Asia, China, Mesoamerica, the Andes and the adjacent Amazon basin, the eastern U.S., Africa's Sahel, West Africa, Ethiopia, and New Guinea), all of which became the earliest homelands of agriculture and thus regions that got a head start on developing guns, germs, and steel.  <br /> <br />Animals were vital to a society as a source of meat, milk products, fertilizer, transportation, leather, for military use, plow traction, and wool and those areas that lacked suitable animals to domesticate suffered accordinglyin terms of societal development. The Late Pleistocene extinctions of large mammals in the Americas and Australia deprived humanity in those areas of potentially very valuable domesticable species. Of the big (over 100 pound) herbivores and omnivores, 148 potential candidates for domestication, they are mostly located in Eurasia (72 candidate species, versus 51 in Sub-Saharan Africa, 24 in the Americas, and 1 in Australia). Further, out of those candidates, only 14 were actually domesticated, 13 of them in Eurasia; what he called the \\"Major Five\\" - sheep, the goat, cow, pig, and horse, and the \\"Minor Nine\\" - the Arabian camel, Bactrian camel, donkey, reindeer, water buffalo, yak, Bali cattle, mithan (wild ancestor the gaur, found primarily in India and Burma), and the one American one, the llama and alpaca (two well-differentiated breeds of the same species). The other 134 potential candidates were eliminated due to problems with diet, growth rate, problems of captive breeding, nasty disposition, tendency to panic, and/or social structure, any one problem enough to preclude domestication even in modern times. Of further interest, Southwest Asia had seven of the wild ancestors naturally occurring, a huge advantage.  <br /> <br />In the world of plants there were similar disparities in distribution; of the 56 species of grass with the heaviest seeds, at least 10 times heavier than median species, Eurasia's Mediterranean zone had 32 of them, with barley and emmer wheat 3rd and 13th respectively in seed size. In contrast, of the 56 species, only 6 were found in East Asia, 4 in Sub-Saharan Africa, 11 in the Americas, and 2 in Australia.  <br /> <br />Another set of differences lead to a variation in societal evolution in the case of plant and animal domestications as well as in technological innovations and political institutions, as most societies acquire much more from other societies than they invent themselves (his discussion on the evolution of writing and in particular the alphabet in this regard was fascinating). Diffusion and migration within and between continents played a very important role in the development of a society, and in some continents diffusion and migration was considerably easier, most rapid in Eurasia because of its east-west major axis and its relatively modest ecological and geographical barriers. As crops and animals depended strongly on climate and hence on latitude, huge areas ranging almost from the Atlantic to the Pacific were open to the movement of domesticated plants and animals. Diffusion was slower in Africa and especially in the Americas due to those continents north-south major axes (traveling just a few hundred or a thousand miles north or south can render a society's crops and animals completely unsuitable for use) and much more pronounced geographic and ecological barriers (such as the Sahara Desert in Africa). Similarly, diffusion in the last 6,000 years has been easiest from Eurasia to sub-Saharan Africa, while long completely absent between Eurasia and the Americas (isolated at low latitudes by broad oceans and at high latitudes by geography and by a climate suitable just for hunter-gatherers).  <br /> <br />The last set of major factors he analyzed related to continental differences in area or total population size. A larger area or population meant more inventors, more competing societies, more innovations that exist to be adopted, and more pressure to adopt and retain those innovations, as those societies that fail to do so tend to be eliminated or absorbed by competing societies. Among the world's landmasses, area and the number of competing societies were greatest for Eurasia, while considerably smaller for Australia for instance. The Americas, despite their rather large total land area, were in effect fragmented by ecology and geography into a series of poorly connected smaller continents.  <br /> <br />Relating to both population size and the \\"Eurasians' long intimacy with domestic animals\\" was the development of germs. Crowd diseases could not sustain themselves in small bands of hunter-gatherers or slash-and-burn farmers, nor perhaps would they develop at all, as only human association with cattle gave us for instance measles (evolved from rinderpest) and smallpox (evolved from cowpox).  <br /> <br />Obviously I have just scratched the surface in my review. This is an excellent book that ties together findings in history, archaeology, paleontology, epidemiology, and linguistics in an extremely readable and informative format.  <br />	2005-04-15
US	52590451	R27YX1VCX7J65H	0375756396	527698945	Pagan Holiday: On the Trail of Ancient Roman Tourists	Books	5	15	18	N	N	Informative, interesting, and amusing travelogue and history	_Pagan Holiday_ by Tony Perrottet is both an amusing and interesting travel book and an excellent history focused on the very first age of tourism, the age of Roman tourism. With the advent of a massive, highly detailed and for the time very accurate map unveiled in 5 B.C. (completed by the Roman war hero Marcus Agrippa), the completion and extension of Rome's glorious highway system, the acceptance of Roman currency even to the farthest reaches of the Empire, two unifying common languages (Greek and Latin), and the Pax Romana (the longest unbroken period of peace in European history, lasting roughly from 30 B.C. to A.D. 200), the world was open to legions of Roman tourists. These viatores or peregrinatores (wayfarers; also called spectatores or sightseers) would go on what he called the original Grand Tour, journeying to resorts in other parts of the Italian peninsula, to sacred and historical sites in Greece (the Hellenic \\"greatest hits\\" including Athens, Delphi, Olympia, Sparta, and Epidaurus), the Olympic games if possible, to the ruins of Troy, the Colossus of Rhodes, and the exotic and fantastic ruins in Egypt (which to first century A.D. spectatores were mostly enigmatic relics from a forgotten epoch, nearly as ancient to the Romans as they are to us today). Across the entire Mediterranean world a complex tourist infrastructure arose to cater to the needs of the Roman traveler. Perottet sought to both describe the experiences of the Roman tourists - who they were, what they saw, how they traveled, and the difficulties they encountered - and to replicate their travels as closely as possible, to show to the modern reader what they might have been like and to describe the ruins as they appear today. <br /> <br /> I found the parallels between Roman and modern tourism quite striking. Perrottet provided numerous examples of Roman contemporary accounts of stays at roadside inns (where even some of the richest Roman tourists complained of hard mattresses, leaky roofs, and bad food), eating at restaurants serving highly questionable fare, visiting lavish temples (which the author noted were in many ways the equivalent of modern museums as they were often crowded with statues and all manner of artifacts), and sending home letters to friends and loved ones. <br /> <br /> Another parallel between Roman and modern travel (particularly in the Third World) is the fact that tourists often had to deal with shysters and con artists competing for their attention at every site they visited, each one proclaiming that he can show secrets about the site and provide a true and accurate history (though that was very rarely the case). Perrottet vividly described the hordes of professional tour guides (called mystagogi) that clustered around the most significant tourist attractions, each competing for the attention of the Roman tourist, spouting memorized spiels of \\"facts\\" to the tourist, often geared towards the Roman ear by tying in local legends and ruins to Homeric accounts of the Trojan War or to the Roman gods. These guides often exasperated Roman tourists; one academic was known to have prayed to Jupiter to protect him from his guides at Olympia!  <br /> <br /> Also like today, the Roman tourists bought tacky souvenirs. Numerous painted glass vials showing the Lighthouse of Alexandria and miniatures replicas of famous statues of Apollo have been found.  The author said that these were the ancient equivalent of water-filled snowscapes of famous tourist attractions.  <br /> <br /> Roman tourists were fond of leaving mementos of their journey, generally by etching graffiti onto their favorite monuments. Precisely 2,105 pieces of Roman graffiti have been noted (and studied) from the Valley of Kings alone.  They often preferred to inscribe Homeric verse (some wealthy Roman tourists even brought poets along so that they could do this), while others left much simpler messages (\\"I was amazed\\" was a common inscription on notable ruins and tombs).Some sites thoughtfully provided stone carvers for hire so that these messages could be left.  <br /> <br /> Though the Romans traveled primarily by ship, this age saw the first \\"road trips.\\" In particular the compact size and density of sites to see in Greece lead many Romans to hire wagons on the outskirts of Athens and travel on the excellent Roman highways to the various destinations they sought, taking advantage of roadside inns, periegesies (guidebooks), itineraria picta (graphic itineraries or maps), and even roadside markers (miliaria or milestones). Perrottett quoted a number of times from one of the most notable and thorough periegesies to survive into modern times, the _Description of Greece_ composed by the travel writer Pausanias between A.D. 130 and 180, an encyclopedic work that comprised originally ten papyrus scrolls, an amazingly thorough guidebook to the whole of mainland Greece. <br />  <br /> Several Roman tourist destinations - notably Sparta and Troy - were but shadows of what they were in their heyday. While Sparta was a major city-state in the 5th century B.C., by the days of the Pax Romana it largely maintained its famed traditions for the tourists, with such events as the annual scourging of the youths at the festival of Artemis performed primarily for the benefit of its visitors.  <br /> <br /> One way Roman tourists differed from modern ones was in how the very richest traveled. The wealthiest aristocrats would have their private wagons for instance shipped to Greece, where they would travel in a slow and sumptuous convoy that included a huge retinue of chefs, slaves, and secretaries. These rich tourists would dine in silk-curtained tents set up each night as dining halls, eat off plates of beaten gold, and sleep in luxurious carrucae dormitoriae (sleeping carriages). The very richest and most powerful of travelers - several Roman emperors enjoyed the Grand Tour - often required years of preparatory work as entire buildings (notably baths) would be erected in anticipation of their visit. Whenever an emperor passed through a city it was nearly bankrupted by the massive expenses in entertaining him and his retinue.  <br /> <br /> A very entertaining book - Perrottet and his girlfriend had a number of interesting encounters along the way in their travels - I thoroughly enjoyed it.  <br />	2005-04-06

Set aside with the death of the author's longtime friend and editor, Albert Skira and the collapse of the project, the book was only published for the first time in 1998, well after the author's death in 1985.  <br /> <br /> In the book's introduction, written by Oswyn Murray, we learn something of the history of the book and the series it was supposed to be a part of, as well as the life of Braudel himself. Braudel was an interesting man; he invented microfilm, copying thousands of historical texts for study prior to accepting a position at a Brazilian university, and his most famous work, _The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II_, he wrote during four years of captivity in a POW camp in France, aided by a few books, but \\"using mainly his prodigious memory of his prewar researches,\\" writing the great treatise out by hand in exercise books on a small plank in a room shared with twenty other prisoners. <br /> <br /> As there have been some advances in archaeology as well as changes in historical thinking, endnotes accompanied the text, with experts Jean Guilaine covering prehistory and Pierre Rouillard on history. I was surprised how few endnotes there were, as substantially much of what Braudel written is still current. Many of the notes referred to different dates for events and in particular artifacts - not surprising, as Braudel himself noted in the text how advances were continually being made in scientific dating methods - and in a few other areas, notably thoughts on prehistoric megalithic culture in the Mediterranean and on the crisis of the twelfth century B.C (both of which he seemed to have largely gotten wrong, not that either formed a very large part of the book's content).  <br /> <br /> Overall I found the book quite broad in scope, dealing mainly with regions, empires, movements, and the \\"longue duree,\\" which is often translated as \\"the long perspective.\\" Except for the last chapters on Greece and Rome, named individuals are rarely discussed. Much of the book dealt with the rise and fall of empires, the advancement and consequences of the mastery of new technologies such as pottery and weaving, as well as the continuing evolution of others, such as metalworking (tracing the advent of bronze, then iron), language (the development of an alphabet was to have profound consequences) and seafaring (his sections on the continuing evolution of ship technology were interesting and well-illustrated with contemporary art), and the development of trade and long-distance exchange in the Mediterranean as a whole and separately in the eastern and western portions. While it was good to have such a broad perspective that transcended local dynasties and city-states, sometimes it made for somewhat dry reading. <br /> <br /> The book was epic in scope, covering the Mediterranean from prehistoric times to the founding of what would come to be the Byzantine Empire. The ancient Jews and Christians didn't get a lot of coverage but some other Mediterranean civilizations - notably the Phoenicians, Minoans, Carthaginians, and the Etruscans - are covered in detail. Indeed Braudel's work contained the most information on the Etruscans that I have personally ever read.  <br /> <br /> One of things that Braudel did that I liked the most was to make comparisons of ancient Mediterranean countries, entities, and movements with more recent counterparts. He compared the scribes of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia to the mandarin class of China, as it took years to master early writing and number systems, restricting writing and calculating to a privileged and talented elite. Continuing the China analogy, Egypt thanks to its rich harvest of grain and large amounts of Nubian gold (Nubia means \\"land of gold\\") was for centuries economically dominant and self-sufficient, extremely confident and self-centered. Much as Spain once was made rich and become dependent upon New World silver, so too did the Phoenicians and later the Carthaginians become rich and dependent upon rich silver mines in Spain. Carthage itself was a new city that sprouted from nothing like an American town according to Braudel, for a time a materialistic, fast-moving, dynamic melting pot of a civilization.  <br /> <br /> One thing about the work that I both liked a lot and disliked was the fact that Braudel would bring up a fascinating point and then pretty much drop it. He speculated on why the \\"Macedonian Wunderkind\\" (a.k.a. Alexander the Great) didn't turn his great drive to the west rather than the east, conquering Carthage (something the Carthaginians greatly feared) and turning the entire Mediterranean into a Greek lake. He raised this point, discussed a little what might have happened, and then dropped the point in about three pages. Similarly he mused on the vast difference between Greek science and philosophy and the actual urge to apply these thoughts and ideas to mechanical experiments and practical tools, why there was no full-scale industrial revolution in Rome, and why when there were Romans who had produced steam-powered toys but had not then sought to apply this to a wide range of applications. He dismissed the standard answer to the question - that the existence of slavery killed any drive to produce labor saving devices - by noting that among other things that the workers in the early English and then the European industrial revolution hardly had a good standard of living and he seemed to imply that they were little better than slaves themselves (perhaps in fairness no one has the answer here). Braudel also briefly discussed whether or not conflict between Carthage and Rome was inevitable, a section that I thought ended just as it was getting interesting (as for a time the Etruscans, Greeks, and Phoenicians/Carthaginians shared the same sea).    <br /> <br /> An interesting book, one worthwhile I think to the serious student of ancient Mediterranean history but not exactly light reading at times.  <br />	2005-03-28

Cantor is a very readable and useful general introduction to the history and culture of the ancient Mediterranean. Though he wrote in his introduction that this book covers antiquity from earliest humanity (about 2.5 million years ago) to the fall of the Roman Empire (in the west) in the fifth century A.D., the focus is primarily on the cultures of ancient Greece and Rome as well as on ancient Judaism and early Christianity (with Jewish history particularly well covered). Ancient Egypt is fairly well discussed though there is very light coverage on the civilizations of Mesopotamia and some of the other Mediterranean civilizations, such as those of the Minoans, Phoenicians, and the Carthaginians (and generally the latter only in context with Roman history). Having said that though, I still found the book worthwhile as it provided a nice review of ancient history.  <br /> <br /> The book has a somewhat odd format. Part I, which he titled the Basic Narrative, is a series of short chapters laying out basic facts about ancient times that he felt every educated person should know. Most of the chapters in this section are about five to ten pages in length. Part II, which he called Societies and Cultures, is over half the book and goes into much more detail, though also covering again some information mentioned in Part I. Part II had some particularly interesting sections, including a chapter on the legacy of Roman law (and on that of  Marcus Tullius Cicero, the greatest Roman lawyer of all time) and on divisions in the early Christian church. This latter chapter was particularly unusual, constructed as an imagined conservation between Saint Augustine (tremendously influential Christian theologian from early fifth century Tunisia), his sister Placida, and a one time friend of Augustine, Bishop Vincent, a leader of a Christian sect called the Donatists, one that Augustine was at odds with.   <br /> <br /> Cantor remarked several times how remarkableit was that the small city-state of Athens (counting farmers in the nearby countryside not more than 200,000 people at any one time) managed to forge an empire and to become for a time the predominant political, military, economic, and most importantly for us today cultural center for not only Greece but for the Mediterranean. This particular culture gave us Aristotle, Socrates, and Plato, incredibly influential thinkers and writers that along with the Hebrew Bible were the foundations for Western civilization.  <br /> <br /> The author compared the Jews and the Athenians on one interesting point; both were cultures grounded in an epic historical myth. The Jews had their Exodus and the Athenians had the Trojan War as described in the epic poem _The Iliad_, both of which were national historical myths that gave \\"identity and moral authenticity\\" to their respective peoples. While the Jews were seen as \\"heroic refugees from slavery\\" and \\"righteous conquerors\\" of a pagan land, the Athenians saw themselves as descended from courageous warriors. Controversially, Cantor wrote that there is no evidence of any Jewish Exodus from Egypt (he does provide sources), though I myself had not read that the Exodus was wholly myth. Another observation he made, again new to me, was that Homer was not some folk poet nor were his writings folk stories that grew with time. Rather, Homer's writings were created specifically for the Athenian market, with his sequel to _The Iliad_, _The Odyssey_, revealed \\"clearly\\" that he was a \\"market-driven professional writer,\\" one who borrowed heavily from traveler's stories and Egyptian fantasy in concocting his tale.  <br /> <br /> Ancient Judaism is very well covered with Cantor describing the evolution of the synagogue and how the modern threefold spilt in Jewish religious culture had it origins in ancient times, as well as the relatively late addition of the concept of personal immortality in Judaism, a concept that quietly entered the rabbinical mainstream around 200 B.C. as a \\"concession\\" to the anxious masses by religious leaders.  <br /> <br /> One interesting point he made several times in the book regarded a civilization's views of history and progress. For centuries the forces for change in the great societies of Egypt and Iraq were generally external rather than internal, spurred not generally by internal power struggles and change but by invasions (with one notable exception in Egypt, the attempt by the Pharaoh Akhenaton to impose a new monotheistic religion around the year 1330 B.C.). The Egyptians felt that events of the moment were transitory, that the present was eternal, and that the world was as a whole static. Egyptian literature did not have careful records of events or the distinctive traits of individual pharaohs, but rather strove to portray the divine ideal, the eternal nature of the subject, independent of time and space. History was at best cyclic. Similarly, many Greeks felt that history moved in circles, repeating itself infinitely. The Jews (and later the Christians) felt instead that history moved forward directly, unrepeatable, from the creation to the end of the world, all preordained by a divine plan. The Jewish idea that each event in history was singular and that history proceeded along a straight path was Cantor wrote to have a profound impact upon European thinking.  <br /> <br /> Though much of the book focuses on the history of the ancient Mediterranean and the importance of Aristotle, Plato, the Bible, Roman law, and Greek theater (among other things) to the foundation of Western civilization, the author did note some of the deficiencies of classical culture. While the Greeks gave us epic poems, philosophy, theatrical tragedies, and invented the natural sciences, history, and anthropology and the Romans a huge body of poetry and a system of law still more or less in use today in much of Europe, they gave us virtually nothing of the rich oral traditions of the ancient Mediterranean nor any accounts of the hopes, thoughts, and feelings of the millions of people of the era. Additionally, classical culture often lacked a social conscience, oblivious to slavery, despotism, poverty, disease, everyday cruelty, and \\"might makes right\\" ways of thinking.  <br />	2005-03-08

Sennott is an excellent, important, and timely book, one of the best I have ever read on the modern Middle East. In this work he sought to do three things; one, tour the lands that Jesus visited as chronicled in the New Testament, describing what these locales are like today, two, report the problems of the indigenous Christians of the Middle East, and three, to discuss their role in the region.  <br /> <br />The Christian presence in the lands Jesus lived in is unfortunately a diminishing one and Sennott was keen to document the historical, economic, political, and religious reasons for this ongoing exodus. In some ways the history of Christians in the Holy Land has always been one of emigration; nearly all of the apostles emigrated, fearing reprisals not only from Rome but also from such Jewish groups as the Sadducees. In the intervening centuries Christians have generally been a minority in the region, except perhaps during a brief period under the Byzantine Empire (in the fifth and sixth centuries).  <br /> <br />While small, the Christian presence has endured until the 20th century, where particularly in the latter part of the century (and the early years so far of this century) it has been running the real risk of dying out completely in many areas. According to the census data kept by the Ottoman Empire, the Christian population in 1914 was 24% of what we could call today Israel/Palestine, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Turkey; today it is no more than 5%. In British ruled Palestine it was as much as 20% of the population (though some put the figure at 13%), while today in Israel/Palestine it is less than 2%. About 35% of the total Christian population of Israel/Palestine (about 60,000 out of 700,000 total) were among those refugees who fled the fighting in 1948 and were not permitted by Israel to return. The Coptic Church in Egypt - one of the oldest in Christendom, tracing its roots back to Saint Mark the Evangelist, said to have arrived in Egypt in A.D. 60 - is steadily declining as well. The Copts number in 2000 about 5 million, or 6% of Egypt's population of 70 million; in the early 1970s there were 4 million but a bigger percentage of the population at around 12%. In early 20th century Jordanian Christians were 13% of the population; in 2000 they are only 2%.  Lebanon has gone from in 1932 a 51.2% Christian population to a 25% one today.  <br /> <br />Why have Christians emigrated in such large numbers or otherwise declined as a percentage of the overall population? There are many factors and the author was quick to point out that the reasons for leaving were not always religious in nature. Generally Christian communities have a lower birthrate, while in many areas Muslims have soaring birthrates. In some areas there has been a steady rate of conversion to Islam, generally among young women and as a result of marriage to Muslims.  <br /> <br />War has played a big factor in emigration, with in particular Palestinian Christians leaving in waves with each major Arab-Israeli conflict and many thousands of Maronite Christians leaving Lebanon in the fifteen years of civil war (from 1975 to 1990 850,000 Christians fled the country).  <br /> <br /> The Christians, whether Copts in Egypt, Palestinian Christians, or Maronite Christians in Lebanon, generally had higher levels of education and were wealthier and were therefore better able to move, had more to lose in regional conflicts (such as the many Israeli crackdowns on Palestinian travel and trade with Israel, economically crippling to many Christian-owned businesses), and had to face resentment and jealousy from less well-off Muslim neighbors. Further, they generally had much stronger ties to the West, with Western churches in Europe, North America, and Australia (along with already resident immigrant communities in those nations) often times actively encouraging their emigration.  In addition, as more and more of a particularly Christian family immigrated to a particular locale, the pressure mounted on those that remained to join their relations overseas.  <br /> <br />However, religion can and does play a role in Christian emigration, and the very fact that Christians are leaving only serves to exacerbate the situation in the Middle East. Christians in Palestine, Egypt, and Lebanon were an important secular and moderating influence in those areas. A minority, the Christians as leaders and as individuals did not emphasis religious differences or indeed religion at all, but instead often promoted unifying traits, whether bloodline among individual families or simply by being Arab. Their very existence and role in the economic and in particular the political life of the nations they inhabited served to promote a sense of pluralism and secular government, a factor working against (particularly in recent years) an increasing \\"climate of intolerance,\\" whether radical Islamic (particularly in Lebanon with Hezbollah, Egypt, and among the Palestinians) or religiously Zionist.  With Christian emigration pluralism and secular governments face an uncertain future.   <br /> <br />The increasing role of radical, highly religious Islam has sundered many once mixed Christian-Muslim communities everywhere from Upper Egypt to the West Bank, with Christians futilely pointing out common ties and interests, pleas unheard by angry youths stirred up by radical Muslim clerics, their hatred whipped up against \\"infidels\\" and \\"Crusaders\\" despite the fact that the indigenous Christians had  in general been in the region for millennia and that often tribes and families had both Christian and Muslim branches; suddenly a neighbor your knew all your life was \\"the enemy.\\"  Sometimes this growing divide was encouraged by Israel, whether accidentally by giving preferential treatment to the often better educated, wealthier, and less combative Christians or deliberately by seeking to fracture Palestinians in a divide and rule strategy among Christians and Muslims. Other times the Christians did this to themselves, as the Maronite Christians of Lebanon, eager and greedy to stay in power, would ally with one outside group after another (such as France or Israel) against Muslim factions in their own country.  <br />	2005-03-01

Though I was worried that the book might carry a high \\"gross\\" factor (and in truth some things were a bit disturbing), my concerns soon evaporated as I became intrigued by these incredibly interesting and important organisms.  <br /> <br /> Early in the book we learn just how diverse a group parasites are. Most people when they hear parasites mentioned might picture tapeworms or perhaps something out of a science fiction/horror movie, but in reality parasites include protozoa, nematodes, fungi, wasps, flies, crustaceans, some species of plants, even bacteria and viruses (which Zimmer writes for some reason are not often thought of as being parasites, though that is indeed what they are). Many parasites are highly specialized (such as a species of nematode that lives only on the Achilles tendon of a particular species of deer or worms that subdivide the human eye - retina, orbit, chamber - into different niches for different species) and often are extremely common on a given animal (one parrot species from Mexico was documented to have thirty species of mites living on its feathers; one duck was found to have fourteen parasitic worm species, each in its own particular section of the intestine, numbering 22,000 individuals all told). Parasites can include \\"social parasites\\" like the cuckoo, which gets other bird species to raise its young. According to some researchers, parasites may outnumber free-living species by as much as four to one.  <br /> <br /> Zimmer covered much of the history of the study of parasites. In ancient and medieval times their presence in animals was confusing. The existence of so many different worms, flukes, and other creatures in fish and other organisms people examined lead to ideas of spontaneous generation, an idea considered heretical by the Church as only God could create life. Well into the nineteenth century parasitology was more of a \\"loose federation than an actual science,\\" as veterinarians struggled against livestock parasites, entomologists analyzed some species of insects, and specialists in tropical medicine repeatedly failed in their efforts to develop vaccines and drugs to treat parasites (Zimmer discussed at length why vaccines are generally quite ineffective against eukaryotic or non-bacterial/non-viral parasites).  <br /> <br /> Additionally, many historically have regarded parasites as being degenerate, devolved organisms. Some, such as nineteenth century British zoologist Ray Lankester, were positively horrified by parasites, appalled by organisms such as the barnacle _Sacculina carcini_, an animal that upon an adulthood found a crab, lost its legs, tail, and mouth, and gained all future nourishment from its host. Even when they didn't hate parasites personally, many researchers seemed to believe that parasites were largely irrelevant, not figuring into such things as say ecological studies.  <br /> <br /> In fact, Zimmer showed in the book that parasites are highly evolved and very capable organisms. Different parasitic copepods are specially adapted to cling to the differing scales of each particular species of fish that they infest. _Trichinella_ is a multicellular animal (a nematode) that lives inside a single cell, so adept at making a home in its host body that it is a \\"viral animal;\\" not only disabling a host's genes but manipulating them to help construct an ideal home. The root-knot nematodes of the genus _Meloidognye_ do much the same thing, changing the structures of the plant cells they inhabit by tampering with the host's DNA to build their homes. Some types of parasitic wasps are able to inject something akin to a virus to rework the DNA of the caterpillars they implant their eggs in. The extensive coverage of the on-going wars between immune systems and parasites was more than enough to dispel any thoughts that parasites were somehow degenerate;parasites are able to avoid, distract, and even manipulate the immune system to repel other parasites or disperse their offspring.  <br /> <br /> My favorite thing about the book was Zimmer's excellent coverage of the often bizarre lifestyles of parasites. Many parasites are able to manipulate their host's bodies in amazing ways. Many types effectively neuter their host, using resources that their host would have used to develop eggs instead to feed the parasites. One parasite of crabs (_Sacculina_) is even able to fool the host into treating its eggs as if they were the crab's, not the parasites. Zimmer discussed the ecological role of these spayed hosts at length as these evolutionary non-productive hosts compete with other members of their species that do reproduce.  <br /> <br /> Even more interesting, some parasites are able to change the behavior of their hosts; some parasites use more than one host species, with one or more intermediate hosts serving for a time as a home. When the parasite is ready to move to the next stage of host, it modifies its behavior so that the host gets eaten. One of several examples he provided was a tapeworm species that uses a beetle as an intermediate host before reaching its final host, rats; when ready to enter a rat the tapeworm makes the beetle sluggish, less conscientious about concealment, even turns off its only defense, glands that can produce a foul-tasting chemical.  <br /> <br />A number of parasites unfortunately plague humankind and these are covered as well. Trypanosomes (a protozoa species) for instance cause sleeping sickness, an illness spread by the tsetse fly in Africa, an ailment that plagues cattle and humans in a wide swath of the continent (another species of trypanosome causes Chagas disease in South America, a disease that may have afflicted Charles Darwin).  <br /> <br />Parasites can also be beneficial, useful in controlling introduced pest species (many introduced insects can only be controlled by importing their parasites) and possibly even having a positive role in developing medicines to prevent rejection of transplanted organs, prevent blood clots, and eliminate Crohn's disease, colitis, and possibly allergies.  <br /> <br /> Diverse and highly adaptable, parasites were fascinating to read about and Zimmer did an excellent job in covering them in terms of biology, ecology, medicine, history, culture, even as treated by Hollywood.  <br />	2005-02-22
US	52590451	R15D4YLP58LVWC	0425191184	17508097	Red Rabbit (Tom Clancy)	Books	1	15	16	N	N	Worst Tom Clancy novel I ever read	_Red Rabbit_ is the next Tom Clancy novel (after _The Bear and The Dragon_) set in the \\"Ryanverse,\\" the series of stories centering around Jack Ryan. Next that is in terms of order published; the book is set in 1981 and occurs after the events in _The Hunt for Red October_ and _Patriot Games_ but before _The Cardinal of the Kremlin_. Occurring something like twenty years in the past of the history of Jack Ryan, in this novel Ryan and his family have moved to the United Kingdom in his work for the CIA. During the course of events in the book Ryan becomes involved in a complex plot involving a KGB defector and Pope John Paul II. <br /> <br /> Clancy took the real world failed attempt on the Pope's life in 1981 and constructed a story around it. In the book (and in actual history), the Pope wrote and sent a letter to the Soviet Union, threatening to resign his position as Pope and return to his home nation of Poland to fight Soviet oppression there. Soviet leaders - chiefly KGB chief Yuri Andropov - designed an operation to kill the pontiff, dispatching a trusted Bulgarian operative to arrange for another man to kill the Pope (one that could not be traced back to the either the Bulgarians or more importantly the Soviet Union), an operative that would in turn be eliminated himself by the Bulgarians soon after assassinating the Pope so as to further safeguard the originators of the operation (here on out the book is entirely fictional). A communications specialist and cryptographer working for the KGB (by the name of Oleg Zaitzev) is assigned to the task of handling communications between Moscow and the Bulgarians. Horrified by what he learns he is encrypting and sending back and forth between the two parties, Zaitzev decides (without telling his wife and his young daughter) that he has a huge problem with this operation and seeks (rather clumsily) to make contact with the Americans working in Moscow. The man he makes contact with is Ed Foley, the rather recently arrived CIA station chief in Moscow (who along with his fellow agent and wife Mary Pat are main stays of the \\"Ryanverse,\\" instrumental in many other stories), who helps to arrange under Zaitzev's (now code-named Rabbit) insistence that he be aided in defecting to the West as a \\"conscience defector\\" (as opposed to say a defector leaving just for money or some other reward or avoiding some other fate). A long (very long) description of his being smuggled out of the Soviet Union and Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe follows, after which he is brought to the United Kingdom, debriefed, and a mission is launched to act on the information about the planned Papal assassination. As you might guess, the assassination attempt is not exactly foiled - the Pope is shot (and recovers) in this universe as he is in ours - but they do manage to defeat the Bulgarian operative.  <br /> <br />Somewhat interestingly, the Americans and British decide they value the Rabbit's knowledge of KGB operations more than the actual information about the planned Papal assassination plot, and go to some pains to fake his death so that the KGB doesn't know he defected, thereby making him even more useful (so that the KGB doesn't know that their communications and operations are being compromised). Ryan, who was involved in getting the Rabbit and his family out of Eastern Europe, has to convince the powers that be that they must undertake some sort of operation to try and save the Pope, even if they aren't allowed to tell the Vatican what they know for fear of losing the advantage of the KGB not knowing that the Rabbit is in fact alive.  <br /> <br /> There, I just told you the whole plot, saving you the effort of wading through it. This massive volume, over 600 pages long, is very long, very slow moving, not brisk reading by any stretch of the imagination. It seemed like it took forever to get anywhere in the book with the plot; you could see where things were going well before they actually got there, whichis fine I suppose if there were twists, surprises, or something you didn't expect. They weren't any twists or surprises. The good guys make plans, the good guys execute plans, the good guy\\"s plans work. There is no real tension - and I don't mean just from the fact that we all know the Pope does get shot and does survive - as the book just doesn't go anywhere. It just plows ahead, so very slowly. I read this book during my lunch break at work, about twenty to thirty minutes three or four times a week, but the book was so slow, so dull, I would not read it for weeks at a time; it probably took me six months to read this dull tome. Easily the worst Clancy book I have ever read. If this were made into a movie I would not go see it.  <br /> <br /> I guess I didn't hate the book, it wasn't horribly written, just not terribly exciting. It was just too slow for my tastes. It could have been a lot more concise, thrown in a few twists maybe, I don't know. I thought it might be interesting to learn more about the supporting characters in the Ryan universe - Ed Foley, Mary Pat, Greer, Ritter, Moore - but you don't really learn terribly much about them either (well a little about the Foleys). Some Cold War spy intrigue might have been interesting (as it was in _The Cardinal and The Kremlin_) but the intrigue here wasn't, well, intriguing.  <br /> <br /> Skip this book. Don't waste your time. Maybe if you were a diehard fan of Jack Ryan and wanted to be able to say you read all of the novels about him, I guess it might be worth your time. I recommend instead one either try his earlier works or try the excellent novels of James W. Huston.  <br />	2005-02-20

By the word collapse, Diamond meant a drastic decrease in population as well as in the economy and political and social complexity of a society, as opposed to a more gradual or milder form of decline. While he admitted that sometimes the distinction between a milder form of decline and a collapse is in some cases arbitrary (how drastic does the decline have to be before it is labeled as a collapse), Diamond analyzed a number of \\"full-fledged collapses\\" that few people would disagree with classifying as such. <br /> <br /> The primary theme of this book is the nature of environmental problems that society face, which he listed in eight categories (habitat destruction and particularly deforestation, soil problems such as erosion and salinization, water supply and management problems, overhunting, overfishing, effects of alien species, human population growth, and increased per capita impact of people), and what they choose to do (or not do) about them.  <br /> <br />Diamond made two additional points. The first is that it is nave to assume that societies have collapsed solely due to human-caused environmental damage. He provided a five-point framework of possible contributing factors, some of which were at work in the collapse of a given civilization, while others were not. Four of these factors - environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, and friendly trade partners (or the lack thereof) - may not prove significant to a particular society's fortunes, but the fifth factor (a civilization's responses to its environmental problems), always does. The second point is that Diamond is not an advocate of any philosophy of environmental determinism - that the environment in which a civilization exists in means that it will ultimately fail. While for instance the moai-erecting civilization of Easter Island collapsed, the society found on much smaller Tikopia Island (1.8 square miles) has existed for 3,000 years  (and still exists) on an island with sustainable cultivation; the Greenland Norse ultimately failed while the Inuit on the same island still exist.  <br /> <br />After an introduction of concepts - including a comparison with modern day Montana - Diamond analyzed in depth the collapse of several past societies, namely that of Easter Island, Pitcairn Island, Henderson Island (both islands are in the Pacific and formerly had Polynesian societies which died out), the Anasazi, the Classic Lowland Maya, and the Greenland Norse, the last of which he spent a great deal of time discussing and made for absolutely fascinating reading.  More briefly he analyzed some past (and still existing) societies that overcame grave environmental crises (that of Iceland, Tikopia Island, the New Guinea highlands, and Japan of the Tokugawa era). To me these sections (around half the book) were the best part (I found lots of very interesting information in the Easter Island chapter).  <br /> <br />Within the framework of these success stories he illustrated two contrasting approaches to environmental success, namely that of a bottom-up approach to a problem (one in which individuals in a society make choices and perform actions to correct environmental problems, as with Tikopia and the New Guinea highlands) and the top-down approach (found in large societies with a centralized political structure, such as Tokugawa Japan). Additionally, both bottom-up and top-down approaches may exist side by side. <br /> <br />Next, Diamond focused on several modern societies that face grave environmental problems today and in the future, specifically Rwanda, Haiti (which he contrasted vividly with the neighboring Dominican Republic), China, and Australia, going into a great deal of detail about their history, culture as it relates to the environment, current environmental problems, and what is being done (if anything) to correct these problems. I found the chapters on Haiti/Dominican Republic (another example he wrote that there is no such thing as environmental determinism) and Australia particularly interesting.  <br /> <br />The fourth part of the book is a section he titled \\"practical lessons;\\" what analysis of collapses, success stories, and modern problems have taught us about what can be done. One thing he wrote is that he disliked single factor explanations for problems or single factor issues for activists to focus on. For instance, with the contrasting environmental realities of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, their differing developments were \\"overdetermined;\\" a number of separate factors coincided to produce the current reality. Another is that for a society to continue to exist at sustainable levels in a deteriorating environment (or for a Third World society to become a First World one), it must decide as a society which of its deeply held core values are compatible with its continued survival, which are not, and then give up those that are not. For instance the love for the farming lifestyle in Australia is a core value in Australia, but to continue having that as a core value may be incompatible with a healthy environment.  <br /> <br />Diamond discussed in detail why societies fail to solve their environmental problems. Briefly, a civilization may fail to anticipate a problem before it arises, it may fail to perceive a problem after it does arrive, they may not even try to solve it, or they may try to solve it and fail. Regarding the second problem he made some interesting points about \\"creeping normalcy\\" (the difficulty in recognizing a gradual downward trend over years because what constitutes \\"normalcy\\" shifts \\"gradually and imperceptibly\\") and \\"landscape amnesia\\" (forgetting what a landscape looked like in the past because the downward change has been so gradual that residents in an area are less aware of it, comparing changes unconsciously to the last few years rather than say 50 years ago). <br /> <br />Diamond does close with saying he is cautiously optimistic that the world's environmental problems can be solved, providing examples of success stories and answering common \\"one-liner objections\\" to environmental policies. A truly excellent book, I highly recommend it.  <br />	2005-02-17

Mukerjee interwove personal accounts of travels to the islands and interviews with government officials, researchers, activists, local residents, and the tribesmen themselves with vivid historical narratives of early contact situations, warfare with, and research on these aboriginal peoples.<br /><br /> The people of the Andamans, long known to Asian and European travelers, were feared for centuries as cannibals and headhunters. They were often referred to as \\"dog-people,\\" as sub-human; in the nineteenth century some were displayed in the Calcutta zoo, where Bengali visitors took them to be descendents of the monkey god Hanuman, and as late as 1925 a paper published in _Man_, a journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, defined the Andaman as a new species of human, _Homo mincopoeus_.  Simultaneously intriguing and repulsing Arab, Chinese, and British travelers by their casual nudity (the natives wore virtually no clothing), ferocity towards outsiders (many of the historical accounts are of hostile first encounters and \\"punitive expeditions\\" against islanders), and their physical features that were more African than Asian, the islanders were little bothered for centuries, the islands mostly unsettled despite being located on major trade routes between India and China. Though outside civilization has become increasingly dominant in the last 200 years or so, there are still remote areas in the archipelago; the one hundred or so individuals who make the island of North Sentinel their home are still very much a stone age people (though many technically no longer use stone but rather work metal from nuts and bolts that wash up on their shores into arrowheads) who may be among the most isolated humans on earth (though how long they will stay isolated is a matter of some concern).<br /><br /> Mukerjee divided the Andaman islanders into four groups. About ten tribes (at one time during colonial times comprised of as many as 5,000-8,000 people) made up a group called the Great Andamanese, occupying most of the Great Andamans (the South, Middle, and North Andaman Islands) and several adjacent smaller islands. They were at war with the elusive Jarawa, a small group that numbered at one time as many as 600, a group that lived in the dense western forest of South Andaman. Seven hundred or so Onge tribal members lived on Little Andaman, a sizable island farther south, and a hundred Sentinelese lived on the eighteen square miles of North Sentinel off to the west.<br /><br /> The author painted a vivid picture of an interesting group of people. Though only distantly related to the Congo Pygmies, they were originally similar in many respects; they lived in dense, moist tropical forests in small bands, had peppercorn hair, painted their naked bodies with clay (a practice which the author discussed at length), used bows, arrows, and nets to obtain food, and had extraordinary botanical knowledge. Hunter-gatherers, they subsisted on a variety of plant products, fish, sea turtles (a favorite), dugongs (now virtually extinct in the islands), and a number of forest animals, the most favored of which was the wild boar, believed by some to have descended from the southern Chinese pig. The natives cared greatly for children; among the Great Andamanese it was considered a compliment and a mark of friendship if a married man, after paying a visit, asked his hosts to adopt one of their children; these parents would in turn not only visit frequently their own but adopt others. Several of the groups had taboos against killing certain creatures. The Great Andamanese for instance ruled that it was taboo to kill a certain spider, a type of beetle, two bird species, two fish species, a certain mollusk, and two types of trees. Cicada grubs were much coveted in several of the islands as food, but many were fearful of upsetting Biliku, the northeastern monsoon wind, whom the cicada was the child of; the islanders would be \\"silent as a mouse\\" during early morning and late evening singing of the cicadas, not doing any work or making any noise.<br /><br /> Unfortunately much of the book is about the very sad state of the Andaman Islanders. Massive, often illegal, deforestation, even in the protected tribal reserves, has resulted in huge erosion problems, silt runoff that has killed nearshore corals and local fisheries, and deprived the islanders of much food and shelter on every island but North Sentinel. Only 42 Great Andamanese remain, most of them alcoholics (a dependency on alcohol and other substances in the past deliberately encouraged by the authorities), suffering from malnutrition thanks to a diet largely of oil and starch, and many of the children fathered by the welfare staff who are supposed to care for them, Mukerjee documenting how the social workers sometimes took cruel advantage of them. The remaining 100 or so Onge are only a little better off.  Disease in the past devastated the islanders and still thins their numbers to this day as they are a people without previous exposure to such illnesses as pneumonia, mumps, and even the common cold. The Jarawa are famous for their resistance, having fiercely fought logging and road construction in their forests, killing laborers and travelers as recently as 1998. Much feared, laborers required guards, police had to escort travelers on the road through their forest; one person told the author, if asked if he ever saw a Jarawa, replied, no, \\"To see is to die.\\" Though there have been some reverses in favor of the Jarawa in the end it seems that they are doomed to be assimilated into Indian culture if they don't perish from disease and deforestation first.	2005-02-03
US	52590451	R3014K50W1IG6P	0865476578	605719111	The Birds of Heaven: Travels with Cranes	Books	5	10	12	N	N	Fantastic, well-illustrated book on all things crane	_The Birds of Heaven_ by Peter Matthiessen is a well-written and informative account of the fifteen living species of crane. Matthiessen chronicled in the book his years of experience with these birds, traveling to Russia, China, Mongolia (where six species have been recorded), India, Bhutan, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Africa, England (where the Eurasian or common crane, extinct there since 1653, is at last a breeding species once more), Wisconsin, Nebraska, and Florida to study and write about the various species. Matthiessen's superb writing is accompanied by truly excellent artwork by artist Robert Bateman, who produced a number of black and white drawings and color paintings for the book.  <br /> <br /> Matthiessen did an excellent job of covering the biology of cranes in general and of each species individually. The crane family (Gruidae) we learn is found on every continent except South America and Antarctica and is comprised of three genera, _Grus_ (to which all but five of the living species belong to and a group primarily found in Eurasia), _Anthropoides_ (which includes the demoiselle crane as well as the blue crane of South Africa, which may be descended from it; Matthiessen discussed many theories of crane evolution), and _Balearica_ (which includes two African species, the black crowned and gray crowned). Though sometimes called herons in some parts of the world (or more often herons are referred to as cranes), cranes differ from herons in that cranes fly with neck outstretched rather than curved back over the shoulder (they differ from storks in that storks display broad tails, which the cranes lack).  <br /> <br />The several species of crane have subtly different breeding habitat and food preferences; for instance in the Amur Basin the white-naped crane probes for tubers while the red crowned crane hunts small animals and picks at vegetation. Not all cranes are restricted to wetlands; while for example all three of the rare white cranes are found only in marshes, the more widespread and abundant demoiselle, Eurasian, and sandhill cranes are generalized feeders able to succeed in a variety of terrains, with the demoiselle primarily an upland feeder.  <br /> <br />Some cranes have rather unusual adaptations. Several species are \\"diggers\\" - feeding primarily on mud-buried tubers - and these species (the white-naped, sarus, brolga, Siberian, and wattled cranes) have naked, non-feathered skin on their head down to the bill, which is an adaptation analogous to the naked head and neck of vultures. The brolga crane, which is more often found in salt marshes than other species, has evolved specialized salt glands near the eyes through which it can secrete concentrated salts. Feather painting is also covered; some species daub their feathers with wet vegetation or mud during nesting season for camouflage.  <br /> <br /> The role of cranes in myth and history is also discussed. The word crane comes from the old German word \\"Cranuh,\\" which like the genus name _Grus_ is a rendition of the bird's cry. The Yakuts people of Siberia revered the Siberian crane as a symbol of their various clans, a uniting symbol for their people. The sarus crane of India (at nearly six feet tall the tallest flying bird on earth) has been for centuries revered as a holy messenger of Vishnu, a Hindu deity, a reverence that has protected this crane from hunting (similarly a Buddhist reverence for life in general and often cranes in particular has helped kept cranes safe in such places as Bhutan). The red-crowned crane (or in Japanese \\"tancho;\\" the heaviest flying bird on earth) was revered as a messenger of death and symbol of eternal life to the Ainu and portrayed in Japanese robes, wedding kimonos, screens, scrolls, and other items for centuries. Revered also in Korea as \\"turumi,\\" a companion to sages, scholars, and musicians, in both nations it was also regrettably hunted and eaten. More recently the peace symbol of the 1960s was originallya Hopi Indian sign derived from the footprint of a crane.  <br /> <br /> One thing that surprised me was that some crane discoveries were made fairly recently. The whooping crane's breeding ground was found after nine years of searching in 1954. A large, breeding, unknown (though known to Aborigines) population of sarus cranes was discovered in 1961 in Australia.  A non-migratory population of red-crowned cranes on Hokkaido wasn't confirmed until 1972.  The breeding ground of the central Siberian population of the Siberian crane wasn't found until 1978. The black-necked or Tibetan crane was as late as 1987 thought to be rapidly vanishing, the second most endangered crane on earth, but surveys in the early 1990s in Tibet and Bhutan pegged the species at a much healthier count of 5,500 birds, showing that early estimates were way off.  <br /> <br /> Issues of crane conservation are well covered, with Matthiessen chronicling the dire straits faced by many of the species, the heroic efforts made by some to save them, and even their role as \\"umbrella species;\\" that when their habitats are preserved many other plants and animals benefit. The Amur Basin of Russia for instance - a vital crane habitat - is being threatened by massive deforestation, agricultural runoff, pollution from mining, and proposed dams. Attempts by such agencies as the International Crane Foundation to broker deals between those nations that share the Amur and its products - Russia, South Korea, China, and Japan - has been stymied by mutual mistrust (extending to ridiculous extremes; Chinese officials refusing for instance to refer to the red-crowned crane as the Japanese or Manchurian crane, both frequently used common names). Some successes exist; the Keoladeo Ghana Bird Reserve near Bharatpur, India, established to preserve wintering Siberian cranes is now also home to 364 bird species as well as pythons, nilgai antelope, and sambar deer (though the park is still threatened by the crush of humanity in crowded India).  <br /> <br /> In addition to being an excellent book on the history and natural history of cranes it is also a wonderful travel book, the author doing a great job of describing what it is like to travel in such exotic places as Bhutan and Mongolia.  <br />	2005-01-31
US	52590451	RUYE7E4G7NJYZ	0700612696	688439488	Sea Dragons: Predators of the Prehistoric Oceans	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Decent overview of Mesozoic marine reptiles.	_Sea Dragons_ is a companion volume to author Richard Ellis' earlier work on the evolution of life in the sea, _Aquagenesis_. During the course of research for the earlier book, he uncovered so much material about Mesozoic marine reptiles that he made a decision to actually leave them out for the most part. He wrote that the material for _Sea Dragons_ came from the \\"scrap heap,\\" a statement I find remarkable as they are among the most interesting -  arguably the most \\"charismatic\\" - extinct marine organisms ever. I also think this book is better written, researched, and illustrated than _Aquagenesis_.  <br /> <br /> The first section of the book provided an introduction to Mesozoic marine reptiles in general, detailing the history of research into these animals and briefly detailing some extinct marine reptiles that are not explored in greater detail later, notably the mesosaurs (marine reptiles up to 3 feet long that lived in the Permian, about 300 million years ago), sea turtles (including extinct species), nothosaurs (Triassic animals that may be ancestral to plesiosaurs and possibly had a seal-like ecological niche), and placodonts (somewhat turtle like reptiles that fed on shellfish). The idea of endothermic marine reptiles is discussed, Ellis noting that not only marine mammals and birds are endothermic but also that several species of fast-swimming pelagic sharks and tuna as well as the leatherback turtle maintain temperatures higher than the waters in which they swim. Also whether or not marine reptiles were viviparous (meaning they bore live young rather than laid eggs) or not is discussed, a subject explored at greater length with each group in its respective chapter.  <br /> <br /> The first group of animals explored at length is the ichthyosaurs, a remarkable group who bear a great deal of resemblance in form to fast swimming shark, dolphin, and tuna species. They were a group of marine reptiles that were highly adapted to a marine existence, existing from the early Triassic (about 250 million years ago) and perishing well before the end of the Cretaceous (about 93 million years ago). Their ancestors a mystery, early ichthyosaurs were long and slim, somewhat eel-like in form, though later species were highly streamlined. The group is fairly well known, with one locale in Holzmaden, Germany, yielding about 35 ichthyosaurs a year and having produced all told over 3,000 specimens; from these and other fossil sites we know that they gave birth to live young and it is highly unlikely that they possessed echolocation but instead were highly dependent upon vision. Ellis reviewed many ichthyosaur species, notably _Shonisaurus_ (at 50 feet the largest described ichthyosaur to date though Ellis noted that an undescribed specimen from British Columbia is 75 feet long) and _Temnodontosaurs_ (a 30 foot long species with eyes 9 inches across, the largest eyes of any animal that ever lived). <br /> <br /> Next Ellis examined the plesiosaurs, a group that is found from the uppermost Triassic to the very end of the Cretaceous (they were around for about 140 million years). Completely unlike ichthyosaurs in form, they possessed long necks with small heads (one species, _Elasmosaurus_, had a neck 47 feet long with 70 neck vertebrae). Much of his chapter on this group noted the many controversies that surround them. How they swam is subject to a great dealt of debate; did they paddle (the limbs moving in the vertical plane, like a human doing a crawl stroke or the movement of a waterwheel in a mill), row (moving in the horizontal plane, in a manner similar to how oars are used on a boat), or \\"fly\\" (the limbs moving roughly in a figure-eight pattern, much like modern sea turtles, sea lions, and penguins; and if they did fly did they have two \\"wings\\" in use or four)? Did they lay eggs or bear live young? How did they hunt; did they hunt from the surface or well beneath it and what sort of motions were their necks capable of? <br /> <br/> The next group are the pliosaurs, a group that some feel is somewhat artificial, either believing the distinction between small-headed, long-necked plesiosaurs and large-headed, short-necked pliosaurs artificial to start with or noting that the pliosaur body plan may have arisen independently several times from ancestral plesiosaurs during the Mesozoic. This group possessed some of the largest predators ever, notably _Liopleurodon_ (most believing it 50 feet in length though Tim Haines, author of the book _Walking With Dinosaurs_ and producer of the BBC TV program of the same name was accused by others of being \\"irresponsible and sensationalistic\\" in claims that it was over 80 feet long). Ellis noted several remarkable specimens, such as a pliosaur (_Leptocleidus_) from Australia, \\"Eric,\\" an almost complete skeleton comprised entirely of precious opal, and one dubbed by detractors \\"Plasterosaurus,\\" a _Kronosaurus_ specimen that required massive amounts of reconstruction and liberal use of plaster. <br /> <br /> The last group examined is the mosasaurs, a kind of marine lizard that appeared in the fossil record 90 million years ago. Not exactly small-sized animals (_Mosasaurus_ reached 58 feet in length), they were arguably the dominant marine predator for about 25 million years, existing after the extinction of the ichthyosaurs (some say there is a connection, though others think that faster, more evasive fish evolved, making ichthyosaur pursuit tactics to metabolically costly and that mosasaurs were ambush not pursuit predators) and during the decline of the pliosaurs. Like the ichthyosaurs, the mosasaurs are relatively well known with many fossils from locations as far apart as Africa, Belgium, Alabama, and Kansas (the Niobrara Chalk formation of Kansas has yielded 1,823 mosasaur specimens, many of which were collected by O.C. Marsh and E.D. Cope in a collecting and naming frenzy that produced such a taxonomic muddle that experts are still confused). I thoughtEllis did a very good job in discussing mosasaur physiology and behavior as well as what evolutionary relationship they have (if any) with snakes and found this section particularly enlightening.  <br /> <br /> Not bad, some of the other reviews note the book's flaws better than I can.  <br />	2005-01-23
US	52590451	R3J5CHUGYNZJ3I	0142001562	595458293	Aquagenesis: The Origin and Evolution of Life in the Sea	Books	4	7	7	N	Y	Decent overview of most marine animal evolution	Author Richard Ellis in _Aquagenesis_ originally sought out to document in a popular science format how the ancestors of marine mammals, reptiles, and birds returned to the sea. In the process of researching the book Ellis became intrigued with the phenomenon of life in the water, from the origin of life itself - which likely took place in water - to the evolution of marine invertebrates and fish. As result, the scope of the book widened considerably. <br /> <br /> Ellis recounted some of the theories about the origin of life. The main one he reviewed was that life may have first appeared around hydrothermal vents in the deep sea, perhaps from impact generated hydrothermal systems (as for a period of about 200 million years, very roughly between 3.9 and 3.8 billion years ago, the Earth may have experienced as many as 10,000 impacts by extraterrestrial bodies). Not only would such environments have been plentiful, but they would have aided by virtue of high temperatures the creation of organic compounds and would have been places shielded from ultraviolet radiation.  <br /> <br /> I found fascinating his discussion of the Ediacaran (or Vendian) fauna, the oldest recorded animals, fossils of soft-bodied organisms that lived between 565 and 535 million years ago. The Ediacaran fauna is unusual; many of these organisms come in strange shapes and sizes, have no recognizable fronts, backs, heads, tails, circulatory, nervous, or digestive systems. Many of them vaguely resembled modern jellyfish, though they appear to have been benthic (or bottom-dwelling) organisms ranging in size from a few millimeters to a meter in diameter. One researcher (Gregory Retallack) according to Ellis believed that the Ediacarans were not soft-bodied animals at all but rather a type of lichen, with a sturdier structure made of substances not unlike chitin. Another paleontologist, Adolf Seilacher, wrote that the Ediacarans are unrelated to any existing lifeform (calling the Ediacarans as a groupthe vendozoans) and postulated that their structure was rather like that of an air mattress. <br /> <br /> The much discussed Burgess Shale fauna is well covered in this book, along with the highly publicized disagreements between the late Stephen J. Gould, who felt the bizarre fauna represented many weird, wonderful, failed experiments, and Simon Conway Morris, who felt that researchers had focused too much on the differences rather than the similarities of the Burgess Shale animals to known species and phyla.  <br /> <br /> Ellis provided a good summary of squids, octopi, ammonites, belemnites, and the nautiloids (including the five existing species of nautilus), though much of his short section on trilobites quoted or paraphrased (with due credit) Richard Fortey's excellent book _Trilobite_. I think he could have been much more thorough though in his very brief discussion of the eurypterids (sea scorpions). <br /> <br /> The evolution of fish is given wonderful treatment, accompanied by (as is much of the text) by Ellis' skillful black and white illustrations. I found his coverage of the coelacanths particularly interesting, noting some of the mysteries that even the living fish present (such as the function of their \\"rostral organ\\" - perhaps it is used to detect weak electrical fields). I also enjoyed his section on bioluminescence, something that still presents an enigma to biologists (such as how the luminous bacteria that some species depend upon to light up in the ocean depths are acquired, particularly if they cannot exist outside of their host and the young of the species are not born with the bacteria already present). Also worthwhile was Ellis' reporting of the Bear Gulch Limestone Formation of Montana (dating back to 320 million years ago from the Mississippian), a truly excellent fossil site that has yielded 4,500 specimens representing 113 species of fish, many beautifully preserved. A number of unusual fossils have been found there, such as the shark _Damocles serratus_, so named because of a dorsal spine with a serrated edge underneath, one that hung over the head of the animal, not unlike the sword that hung over the head of Damocles in ancient Greece. <br /> <br /> Although not marine animals, the evolution of vertebrate limbs is covered as well. Ellis summarized the writings of Jenny Clack and others, noting the theory that the early amphibians used their legs not for terrestrial locomotion but for movement in the water or on river and lake bottoms, and that the study of the origin of tetrapods and the invasion of land by vertebrate animals are two issued that (according to researchers E. B. Daeschler and N. Shubin) need to be \\"decoupled.\\"  <br /> <br /> Reptiles aren't given as much coverage as one might think. While sea snakes, crocodilians, and sea turtles are very well covered (the latter with a nice rundown of living species), the Mesozoic marine reptiles are given short shrift. Ellis has said in his subsequent book on Mesozoic marine reptiles, _Sea Dragons_ that he cut them out of _Aquagenesis_ due to space requirements.  <br /> <br /> The evolution of penguins and particularly marine mammals - sea otters, seals, walruses, whales, dolphins, porpoises, manatees, and dugongs - has some of the best coverage of any subject in the book. Particularly interesting were the problems with the pinnipeds (seals) in the fossil record, how they appear already to be fairly well specialized in the Miocene (about 24 million years ago), lacking much in the way of transitional forms; also the possibility of separate ancestors for the eared seals and walruses (perhaps a bearlike progenitor) and the earless seals (maybe an otterlike ancestor).  <br /> <br /> Near the end Ellis presented the controversial Aquatic Ape theory that humans descended from an ancestor that may have spent a fair amount of time in shallow coastal waters. Citing evidence presented by Alister Hardy and Elaine Morgan that man may have had an aquaticpast - the presence of large amounts of subcutaneous fat, hairless bodies, the only terrestrial mammals that can hold their breath, that humans can swim almost from birth, noses well adapted to keep out water from nasal cavities - Ellis also recounted the opposition this theory has met. <br />  <br /> Though I found a few errors in the book, overall it was enjoyable.  <br />	2005-01-20

Fortey is an enthusiastic expert on all things trilobite - having studied them for over 30 years - and did an excellent job in conveying his passion for these long extinct creatures in a very readable format with many dozens of excellent photographs and sketches.  <br /> <br /> Early on Fortey introduced basic concepts of trilobite anatomy (he said eight technical names is all anyone needs to describe any species). With the help of a diagram of a representative species, we learn for instance that the head is properly termed the cephalon while the other end -the tail - is called the pygidium. Between the cephalon and the pygidium is the thorax, which is subdivided into segments (thoracic segments). A central convex portion or lobe running down the thorax and pygidium is called the axis, while to either side are the lateral or pleural parts.  <br /> <br /> Reading about trilobite eyes was particular fascinating; they were made of calcite (the same substance that makes up the white cliffs of Dover and was popular in classical architecture), something unique in the entire animal kingdom.  Fortey discussed the physics and chemistry of the crystal eyes of trilobites, how they enabled the animal to see, how the lenses on trilobite eyes were arranged and how they functioned, the unique optical properties of calcite, even experiments replicating the vision of individual trilobite species (in particular the experiments relating to the vision of _Phacops_ were extremely interesting; I never knew that physics had such a place in paleontology).  <br /> <br /> We learn also that while whole trilobites are certainly found in the fossil record (or more accurately the carapace of the animal, as the soft and delicate parts such as the legs only rarely fossilize) much of what is found are only bits and pieces, often shed when molting. Thoracic segments, pygidium, and other parts litter the fossil record like puzzle pieces and it is often the job of the trilobite expert to reassemble them, much like a jigsaw puzzle. Some fossils sites - such as Beecher's Trilobite Bed, an Ordovician fossil site in New York - have preserved through unusual circumstances such delicate trilobite parts as their legs (long a mystery to researchers) and even antennae. The details about the life of the trilobite found there - genus _Triarthus_- was fascinating; apparently they lived in a very low oxygen, high sulfur seafloor environment and may have perished during a fatal drop of dissolved oxygen (and were thus preserved) but otherwise lived symbiotically with bacteria that derived energy from sulfur.  <br /> <br /> Fortey introduced the reader to a wonderful parade of trilobite species, relating the history of the group from the Cambrian to its final days in the Permian (the true Age of Trilobites he wrote ranged from the middle of the Cambrian to the Ordovician). We find that trilobites lived in diverse habitats, from the shallowest \\"sands to the deepest-water shales; in sunlit reefs and in gloomy abysses.\\" _Olenellus_ for instance is the commonest of the earliest Cambrian trilobites, a creature the size of a large lobster that was a voracious predator 535 million years ago. _Agnostus_ was a tiny, millimeters long trilobite that swarmed in the millions, odd creatures that only had two thoracic segments and was so abundant that some late Cambrian limestones are made of nothing but this tiny trilobite. _Elrathia kingi_ is the commonest of the \\"rock shop\\" Cambrian trilobites, a \\"middle-of-the road\\" typical trilobite, one of many dozens of very broadly similar trilobites that make specialists gnash their teeth. This species has been known to leave tracks that have been fossilized, one of the true \\"mud-grubbers\\" that plowed furrows in seafloor sediment in its quest for food. _Parabarrandia_ was a streamlined, torpedo shaped Ordovician trilobite, a species that Fortey had performed experiments on in a water tank with dye to prove that it was well suited to a free-swimming role (I never thought one could do experiments on a trilobites; that was fascinating to read). Another free-swimmer was the giant-eyed _Opipeuter_ (Greek for \\"one who gazes\\") from the Ordovician, with eyes oriented to see forwards and backwards and a body plan designed to house powerful swimming muscles.  Also from the Ordovician was _Isotelus_, an unusual animal which completely lacked eyes and had a head surrounded by a border full of perforations, not unlike a colander. This pitted fringe lay about the front of the head sort of like a halo, a rather complicated bit of Paleozoic engineering, the function of which has remained an enigma.  The Devonian abounded in trilobites covered in prickles and spines (possibly related to the dominance of fish); one, _Dicranurus_, among its spines appeared to have had great curling ram horns originating at the neck.  <br /> <br /> As fascinating as trilobites are, Fortey had encountered those that question why he has devoted his life to their study. The author made an excellent case that knowledge of trilobites has played vital roles in the debates over the origins of new species and the nature of evolution itself (researches have been able to track changes in trilobite species over time thanks to their great abundance in the fossil record) and in the study of the positioning of ancient continents (as it has been discovered that trilobites make excellent index fossils, not only for marking intervals of geologic time but also to mark the shores of ancient continents, enabling or aiding in the mapping of the ancient world; indeed Fortey himself named an Ordovician ocean, Tornquist's Sea, which separated the continents of Avalonia and Baltica, thanks to trilobites). Fortey weighedin also in such divisive concepts in evolution as gradualism versus punctuated equilibria, the nature of the Cambrian explosion (and what trilobites tell us about that), the origin of eyes in animals, and the importance (and proper interpretation) of the weird Burgess Shale fauna.  <br />	2005-01-07

This bird with a \\"luminous plumage of green, yellow and red\\" frequented wooded rivers and bottomlands. Once a delight to many Americans the birds unfortunately were persecuted as a threat to crops, for the caged bird industry, and for the demands of women's fashion. Cokinos suggested though that the main cause for its extinction was habitat destruction. Two related theories of extinction were that the thick bamboo canebrakes once common in the bird's range were mostly cleared out for farmland. In addition to providing food, the bamboo may have given a vital breeding stimulus to the bird (as like bamboo, the parakeets apparently did not breed each year). The second theory is that the bird may have been denied the hollow trees it required for roosting and nesting by the rapid spread across the continent by the European honeybee.  <br /> <br /> Next Cokinos had a lengthy section on the Ivory-Billed Woodpecker, once known as the Lord God Bird (presumably because observers would blurt \\"Lord God!\\" when they spied the nearly two foot long bird with the two and a half foot wingspan). Once the second largest woodpecker in the world (Mexico's Imperial Woodpecker is larger) it ranged across bottomland forests and swamps in the South, west to eastern Texas, north to Missouri, southern Illinois, southern Indiana, and southern Ohio. Though hunted (later largely by collectors, shooting it in fact because they were going extinct), the bird appears to have perished due to habitat destruction. An extreme specialist, it occupied a niche \\"almost as slender as a feather;\\" it primarily fed upon beetle larvae from trees that had only been dead for two or three years. Though they also included seeds and fruits in their diets, they became extremely site dependent on places that yielded the larvae that they favored. Interesting coverage of the Brand-Cornell University-American Museum of Natural History Ornithological Expedition led by Arthur Allen that set out in 1935 on a 15,000 mile scientific expedition to record the sounds of wild birds using brand new technology - one of the places they visited was the Singer Tract in Louisiana where news came out that the last Ivory-bills were found; and the bitter (and lost) fight to save the Singer Tract from destruction by loggers. <br /> <br /> Next Cokinos examined the Heath Hen, an extinct subspecies of Greater Prairie Chicken. The bird once favored dry, brushy habitat with low trees as well as meadows from Maine to the Carolinas (though primarily from New Jersey up to Connecticut and Massachusetts). Once called by naturalists - along with its western cousin - the pinnated grouse owing to the dangling neck feathers on the males called pinnae -  the bird perished on the American mainland by 1870 thanks to loss of habitat due to fire suppression and farming as well as relentless overhunting. The bird survived on the island of Martha's Vineyard and Cokinos covered at length the intense struggle as well as the political infighting over trying to save the bird there. Despite intense hunting of \\"vermin\\" (including feral cats, rats, owls, and hawks), planting of crops to feed the Heath Hen, and other efforts, through a run of bad luck the bird finally perished; the last of its kind apparently died in 1932 in the wild, known from close examination to have been an incredibly old male seven to nine years in age (average lifespan in the wild was one year). The author discussed efforts to reintroduce the Greater PrairieChicken to Martha's Vineyard while highlighting the plight of the possibly doomed Attwater's Prairie-Chicken of Texas and Louisiana, which in 1999 has a total population of 146. <br /> <br /> The Passenger Pigeon was the next subject. After impressing upon the reader just how astronomically abundant it once was (one early 1800s flock was estimated to have 2.2 billion birds and a nesting colony in Wisconsin as late as 1871 covered 850 square miles and had 135 million birds), Cokinos related how this bird was systematically destroyed by market hunters, for a time by the cruel trapshooting business (birds were collected to serve as live target practice), and due to habitat clearance (the birds were heavily reliant on the massive amount of mast (nuts) produced by oak, chestnut, and beech trees). The author went into a great deal of detail about the last known wild pigeon (\\"Buttons,\\" so called because once mounted its eyes were in fact buttons for a time) and the last pigeon period (\\"Martha\\" from the Cincinnati Zoo).  <br /> <br /> A smaller chapter focuses on the Labrador Duck. A handsome sea duck also called the Skunk Duck and Pie or Pied Duck, this somewhat poorly known waterfowl had a large and odd-looking bill that aided the bird in its search for sand-buried shellfish. The range of the bird was the eastern seaboard though where it bred is still open to conjecture. Cokinos and others speculated that the bird - never common to start with - may have perished due to loss of shellfish due to overharvesting and sewage runoff and thanks to increased ice packs from the Little Ice Age (which lasted till the 1850s), which may have interfered with breeding sites and aided some predators.  <br /> <br /> Cokinos closed with a by comparison slim chapter on the Great Auk, an interesting chapter that could have been a bit longer. I was struck by the long human contact with them - their images have been found in 20,000 year old French cave art and bones in 4,000 old Newfoundland graves - with care they could have survived to today.  <br />	2004-12-24

The author began it writing as a science journalist - having written a previous book on cave exploration as well has having articles published in such magazines as _Audubon_ - but over the course of the two and a half years he worked on this book went from becoming an observer to an active participant, a point he himself made several times in amazement and wonder. Originally he had set out to chronicle what was known about \\"dark life,\\" microorganisms that dwell far underground or in the deep sea, organisms that derive their nourishment from sources independent of sunlight. These organisms, which have been found in such varied places as salt domes, Antarctic ice cores, and in highly acidic caves, have continually challenged notions of what life can tolerate, organisms so common that they may outnumber surface organisms (indeed Taylor rejected the commonly used term \\"extremophile\\" as he believes the term implies that these organisms are a \\"rare curiosity\\"). Taylor wrote of the history of the search for these microbes, the personalities involved, and where current research was in the field (as well as possible applications of this research). <br /> <br /> Somewhere along the way he became part of the story, as he became the friend and later colleague of several of the researchers he covered. While not a trained scientist per se, at least not in the field of microbiology, he assisted in and even proposed a number of experiments in the search for controversial nanobacteria (microbes with a size of less than 0.2 micrometers, once thought to be too small to be an independent functioning organism or at least too small for a prokaryotic organism, including known bacteria and archaea; not a virus) in a variety of environments, mostly notably Hot Springs National Park in Arkansas. By the end of the book he was regularly exchanging email with researchers, providing samples for them, and even had co-authored a few presentations at various seminars. <br /> <br /> Much of the book is focused on personalities - understandable given Taylor's increasing personal involvement in the story himself - though mainly in the context of research on the topic at hand. The main characters (if you will) in the book were Larry Mallory (a scientist who had devoted his career to harvesting and culturing cave microbes in a promising search for a cure for cancer, particularly from microbes from the fascinating Lechuguilla Cave in New Mexico, an interesting place described in great detail in the book), Bob Folk (a colorful scientist who discovered nanobacteria and their presence in a number of substances and had been in the lead in efforts to prove that microorganisms are vital in the formation of travertine in caves and hot springs as well as in some cases at least entire caves and cave systems), and Anne Taunton (an undergraduate student who as part of a NASA internship became embroiled in the efforts to determine whether or not the famed Martian meteorite ALH 84001 contained fossils of extraterrestrial nanobacteria). Others are followed to lesser degrees, among them Finnish nanobacteria expert E. Olavi Kajander, who had done pioneer work showing that nanobacteria may be the possible agents of many maladies such as kidney stones, Alzheimer's, and Mad Cow Disease that involve mineral precipitation in the body.  In large measure these and other personalities faced considerable skepticism, criticism, and worse in their studies, as scientists found it hard to accept (in different instances) what was thought of as \\"impossibly\\" small bacteria, biological origins for various types of minerals and mineral formations, and the presence of microfossils in ALH 84001. Mallory had to leave his university because he was essentially denied tenure, the administration not believing his study of cave microorganisms important, Folk faced considerable criticism for suggesting that such substances as travertine owed their origins to bacteria, and Taunton (and the team she worked with) had a very difficult time with several scientists - including even her own undergraduate academic advisor - over efforts to demonstrate that the ALH 84001 microfossils were evidence of Martian life or even life of any kind. Although Taylor did a good job of showing the fact there was sometimes intense and even rather personal criticism in science, I don't know if he always showed why people had such a hard time accepting bold new theories. In particular some of the opposition to ALH 84001 fossils was quite heated.  <br /> <br /> Though much of the focus was on personalities, politics, and the process of research the microbes were much discussed as well, many with bizarre biologies. Some cold-loving organisms were termed \\"psychrophiles,\\" capable of growth below freezing, at -5 degrees Celsius, organisms that exhibit slower metabolisms at temperatures above freezing and death at anything approaching human body temperature (organisms that for years - like many other examples of dark life - proved difficult to study and culture in the lab). Some organisms found in apparently solid rock two miles deep, existing only on hydrogen and water, have unbelievably slow metabolisms, appearing to divide cells no more than once per century. Though many caves and indeed individual pools in caves produced unique microorganisms there were also astonishing similarities; the closest relatives to some sulfur-oxidizing thermophilic (heat-loving) bacteria from a cave in Kentucky were found to be a sulfur-oxidizing, symbiotic bacterium from a deep sea polychaeta worm, a relationship that has not yet been explained.  <br /> <br /> At least as far as this reader is concerned Taylor made his case that nanobacteria exist, that they are key in the formation of some minerals and many caves, and I am very open to the idea that ALH 84001 may indeed contain Martian microfossils. I enjoyed reading about the discussions scientists hadabout whether or not subsurface Antarctic lakes such as Lake Vostok and Jovian moon of Europa might have dark life and hope that both can be analyzed in the not too distant future.  <br />  <br />	2004-12-18

Wolfe is an excellent though rather brief introduction to the organisms that live underground; it is only 188 pages long, 206 if one count's the end notes and bibliography (which are quite worthwhile to at least browse). One of the things I liked about the book was that Wolfe was clearly enthusiastic about his subject and expressed a real sense of wonder for the fascinating organisms that dwell under the earth's surface.  <br /> <br /> He began the book with a nice overall introduction to the subject, more than sufficient to grab my attention. In one just pinch of soil from your backyard, you will be holding close to one billion individual living organisms, including quite a few that are not named, classified, or in any way studied, animals ranging in size from the tiniest of microbes to microscopic threads of fungal hyphae, the total length of which might be best measured in miles, not inches. In a handful of soil there are more creatures than humans currently alive. A typical square yard of soil contains billions of microscopic roundworms called nematodes, a dozen to several hundred earthworms, 100,000 to 500,000 insects and other arthropods, and staggering numbers of single-celled organisms. After reviewing some basics about soil layers and types, he went into more detail about this subterranean world. <br /> <br /> The first chapter discussed the origins of life on earth, much of which had to do with life in the soil. The complex structure and chemistry of clay crystals may have played a vital role in the development of life, perhaps initially serving as the \\"infrastructure\\" of the first, most primitive organisms, this infrastructure eventually being discarded as more and more organic molecules such as those in amino and nucleic acids took over clay's replication and synthesis functions. According to some theorists clay made possible the very first sequencing of simple proteins and genes thanks to its unique properties.<br /> <br /> Chapter two introduced the \\"extremophiles,\\" organisms that live in hostile environments, many of which exist in subterranean conditions. Some organisms \\"breathe in\\" iron oxide (rust) as a substitute for oxygen, while others are able to incorporate cobalt and even uranium into their biological processes. Much of the chapter gave the history of the study of extremophiles, as biologists continually had to revise their notions of what life could tolerate as they found organisms living at ever higher temperatures and depths (with organism at 9,000 foot depths and at temperatures higher than 160 degrees Fahrenheit having been discovered). Of further interest, these organisms may be the most common in the world, with some calculations showing that their total biomass exceeds that of all surface life. Study of one group, lithotrophic microbes, which live buried in basalt rock deep beneath the surface, has been vital in the search for life on other planets.  <br /> <br /> Chapter three focused primarily on Dr. Carl Woese of the University of Illinois, a researcher who discovered an entire new microbial superkingdom of organisms, the Archaea, a finding that radically changed how the various kingdoms of organisms were classified, a discovery that was highly controversial, as he changed the tree of life from one based primarily on visual characteristics to one based on his molecular approach. Woese found that a number of organisms assumed to be bacteria were something entirely different, as different from bacteria at least as plants are from animals. In the end the new tree of life consists of three superkingdoms or domains, Bacteria, Archaea (which includes many extremophiles), and Eukarya (which encompasses plants, animals, fungi, and protozoa).  <br /> <br /> Chapter four emphasized the importance of \\"nitrogen-fixers,\\" a small group of bacteria and archaea that are able to convert nitrogen gas in the atmosphere into a form the rest of life on earth can use, a biological innovation every bit as important as the advent of photosynthesis to the history of life on earth. Wolfe showed the rather intricate symbiosis between nitrogen-fixers and plants as well their complex biology. He also discussed the role of denitrifiers, organisms that aid in the recycling of nitrogen on earth as they are able to convert soil nitrates back into atmospheric nitrogen. <br /> <br /> Chapter five dealt with the equally important symbiosis between plants and highly specialized underground fungi, vital in enabling plants to obtain water and nutrients from the soil (and occasionally other plants). More than 90% of the higher plants on the planet today benefit from their association with the delicate threadlike hyphae in their roots, a group known as mycorrhizal fungus. Wolfed discussed the two types, arbuscular mycorrhizae (so named because their unique branching, tree-shaped hyphal structures) and the ectomycorrhizae, both of which are the foundation of most terrestrial ecosystems. <br /> <br /> Chapter six dealt with earthworms, much of it providing information and anecdotes about Charles Darwin's decades long study of them. Also vital to ecosystems, they act as biological blenders, fragmenting plant debris and mixing it with the soil and living and dead microbial biomass, creating more surface area for further production of humus.  <br /> <br /> The next chapter discussed some of the good and bad effects on human health of soil organisms. The passages on the soil-borne pathogen _Clostridium tetani_, the cause of tetanus, made for chilling reading. Wolfe also related information about the fungus-like _Phytopthora infestans_, which causes potato late blight, source of the 1840s potato famine in Ireland (and a disease that may be making a comeback). Soil organisms have also done a lot of good; the root fungus _Trichoderma harzianum_ targets a variety of disease-causing soil microbes, and working in the 1940s soil biologist Dr. Selman Waksman discovered a number of potent antibiotics from soil bacteria.  <br /> <br /> Chapter eight was quite interesting, dealing with the interesting life history and often tragic human history of three animals, the prairie dog, black-footed ferret, and burrowing owl. <br /> <br /> The final chapter dealt with the primary threats to soil ecology, notably soil erosion, toxic waste, and climatic change (both acid rain and global warming). <br /> <br /> A great introduction to subterranean life, worthwhile reading.  <br />	2004-12-13

One could be forgiven I believe for thinking the place uninteresting and unworthy of a nearly 250 page book, the island described by some as a \\"desolate and barren and storm-swept sandbank in the North Atlantic.\\" A crescent shaped island, with arms at east and west reaching to the north, the center bulging towards the south, it is the last lonely outpost of land between Canada and Europe (or Bermuda). Located a hundred miles south of Nova Scotia, it is a mere thirty miles long and at its widest less than a mile wide. A treeless place, it is an island of dunes - some bald, most covered in vegetation - and small ponds. Not a particularly high island, on the north beach dunes reach 85 feet in height, but on the south beach they are rarely more than 8 feet high, considerably shorter than some of the waves that occur during the many gales and storms of the region (though waves that rarely reach the island directly - at least at that height - owing to numerous sand bars miles out to sea around the island). What fame the island has is generally not from it scenery; located on major shipping lands, in an area that is frequently prone to storms and fog, and often not very visible far out to sea, the island has been described as the deadliest piece of real estate in Canada, with hundreds of wrecks having taking place in its waters, fully ten wrecks for every mile of coastline. An additional dangerous feature of the island are its spits located out to the east and west (washed over too often for much in the way of vegetation) which extend between four and nine miles out, as well as the submerged east and west bars, which extend out to eighteen miles - though a massive storm can radically change the size of the spits and bars overnight.  <br /> <br /> The authors spent a great deal of time discussing the geology of the island, introducing many concepts of that science. Sable Island is an island of sand - not rocks, shale, slate, boulders, or really much in the way of soil - as indeed the name Sable is the French word for sand. Geologists have pegged the island's age at around 15,000 years and they believe the island represents a by-product of the glaciers that once covered Canada, that originally Sable Island was the terminal moraine of a glacier's advance (though much of that original sand has since been moved by wind and wave). The island has not been a static one, changing in size and shape numerous times over human history. Many believe that the island will eventually vanish, its sand vanishing into the depths of the Gully, a huge canyon cut in the continental shelf that almost touches the tip of the island's eastern bar, massive in size (largest submarine canyon in the western North Atlantic at 25 miles long, 10 miles wide, and 8,000 feet deep). There is a great deal of debate over whether the island is moving east, moving west, growing, or shrinking, a subject covered a length.  <br /> <br /> Meteorology and oceanography around the island are very well covered, with much discussion of global currents and wind systems. The island is very windy, with average winds at 16 miles an hour, gales of up 85 miles an hour routine, and winds of over 120 mph recorded during hurricane-strength storms. It is also wet - annual precipitation is 55 inches, mostly rain, monthly averaging between 3.6 and 5.7 inches - and foggy (July routinely boasts upwards of 20 foggy days and one June had 126 straight hours of fog).  <br /> <br /> Numerous animals call the island home. For decades the island was known for cattle that had been let loose on the island, though they were all harvested by the 1630s. More famous -and still present - are the ponies of Sable, owing their existence to the politics of the Expulsion (or in French the Grand Derangement or Great Upheaval) of the Acadians in the 1750s. The authors go into a great deal of detail on horse genealogy, firmly showing that the horses bear genetic (and historical) relationships to horses from Acadia. At various times rats, rabbits, cats, dogs, and foxes plagued the island though all have since been removed. Native animals include many species of insects (including three endemic moths and a beetle), a unique nematode, an endemic freshwater sponge which lives in the island's numerous ponds, the Ipswich Sparrow (a subspecies of the Savannah sparrow, breeds only on Sable),  numerous nesting seabirds (mostly gulls, terns, and sandpipers), and seals (mostly gray and harbor). The walrus once occurred on the island but has been extinct since the mid 17th century though for many decades afterward their tusks were collected from the shifting sands. <br /> <br /> Much of the book (I would say over half) dealt with the human history of the island. It was comprehensive, going all the way back to debates over whom first saw and may have landed on the island, whether they were Viking, Basque, or Portuguese. There was much confusion in early maps over where the island was, its exact shape and size, and indeed who owned it. At various times the island was called Fagunda Island, Santa Cruz, and Isola della Rena (rena being Italian for sand) before the name became Sable Island (or Isle de Sable) in 1601. Unfortunately, most of the human history of the island is associated with the numerous shipwrecks, many of them with few if any survivors and at times hundreds of lives were lost, leading eventually to life saving services and lighthouses being set up on the island. Much of this made for exciting reading, with many first person accounts quoted of shipwrecked sailors and those involved in life saving.  <br /> <br /> An interesting book, I would have liked some pictures though.  <br />	2004-12-07

Its Hindi name gulab-sir, the last confirmed sighting of it was in 1935 by a sportsman hunting in the Darbhanga area of Bihar. Never a particularly common animal, it only turned up occasionally during in the Raj in such places as the open markets of Gangtok, Sikkim. Never successfully bred in captivity despite several efforts, the bird was presumed to have gone extinct when most of its prime habitat - marshland around Calcutta - was destroyed though some naturalists held out hope that it may have lingered on in other areas of marsh in the Bengal plain and in northeast India (much of it which is fairly isolated and not well explored by naturalists). <br /> <br /> Nugent became enamored with the animal, sold his apartment, put his belongings into storage, and set out to India to try and find the animal. The book he wrote, _The Search for the Pink-Headed Duck_, is his account of his many months of travels in northern and eastern India.  <br /> <br /> The first half of the book is about him essentially asking about the bird, sometimes in areas and with people whom he suspects have little likelihood of knowing anything about the animal. He spends weeks investigating the fowl markets of Calcutta, checking in every day to see if one has turned up or if anyone knows anything about the bird. Though greeted with suspicion at first, the locals soon warm up to him, calling him the Duck Man, and while providing little if any information do show him many kindnesses. Eventually though as word gets out he is offering a reward for any information on the bird - or the bird itself - a parade of painted birds (including some birds that weren't even ducks) were offered to him for sale. After buying a few so that he could clean them off and set them free, he realized that he had established a precedent he didn't care much for - thathe would buy just about anything - and he moved on. <br /> <br /> Journeying to the capital of New Delhi, he spent literally months trying to get permission to visit some of the most remote areas of northeastern India. At first treated as if he were some sort of spy - though not a very good one - he is later treated as a crazy man (officials incredulous that he is looking for a mere duck), though later many of the officials at the ministry warm to him. Though they deny his requests repeatedly, they are not unfriendly and give him advice on how to appeal each decision as it is made.  <br /> <br /> As the lengthy process to grant him approval winds its way through the labyrinth of bureaucracy, Nugent took two side trips that had really nothing to do with his quest. During the course of his travels he met several individuals who implored him as a visiting westerner and obviously a journalist of some type to expose to the world their various causes. One, a Buddhist named Ganju Lama convinced Nugent to journey with him to Tibet to verify Chinese wrong-doing, but through a series of misadventures he does not actually reach Tibet. Another he met introduced him to key leaders - indeed the key leader, Subash Ghising - of the Gurkha National Liberation Front, people who impress among Nugent the \\"rightness\\" of their cause of Gurkha autonomy if not independence. All of this was interesting and at times hilarious but had absolutely nothing to do with the pink-headed duck (making for good travel writing but not so good natural history writing). <br /> <br /> The second half of the book I found a bit more interesting and a bit more on-topic with the book's title. Just by happenstance meeting in a bookstore in New Delhi a man named Shankar Barua who had roughly similar interests, the two hatch a scheme (after Nugent finally won approval for his journeys) to buy a boat and journey down the mighty Brahmaputra River, an immense 2,900 kilometer river that begins in Tibet and winds itsway through India and Bangladesh on its way to the sea. They purchase a boat that Shakar names _Lahey-Lahey_ (Assamese for \\"Slowly, slowly\\"), a tiny boat that is ten feet at the waterline, twelve long overall and \\"at her beamiest\\" is thirty-inches. Though Nugent, a sailor, admires her lines, the boat continually under whelmed most of the locals who saw it.  <br /> <br /> This journey was Nugent's best chance to spot the duck, and in truth he described very briefly a lot of the wildlife he saw, which included crested serpent eagles, storks, ibises, bitterns, kingfishers, Ganges dolphins, mergansers, pariah kites, and even a rarely seen fishing cat (though a bit too briefly I thought and there are no pictures of these animals; lots of nice pictures instead of the people he met, boats he saw, and some of the buildings and other sites). He saw lots of ducks - including a great many pochards, a species of which does faintly resemble the pink-headed duck in having a red head - I don't think I am spoiling anything by saying Nugent does not get his bird.  <br /> <br /> He has lots of adventures during his long river journey as he is treated with awe, suspicion, humor, or respect at various times because he was a \\"firang\\" or foreigner (being the first white person many along the river had ever seen; many had wondered what was the matter with Nugent that made him looked the way he did). Nugent and Shakar, warned of pirates and crocodiles, found little of either but did have trouble with a whirlpool. They met a variety of interesting people, including Tantrists (who believe that sexual energy is the purest form of energy) and \\"bongs\\" (sailors from Bangladesh, not recorded a great deal of respect by the Indians).  <br /> <br /> An interesting book, sometimes very funny, fairly light on natural history though a good travel essay otherwise.  <br />	2004-12-06

Home to 150 prisoners, under the ruse of an air raid, the prisoners were ordered into trenches to avoid an American air raid but instead of gaining shelter from bombs they were massacred with machine guns, grenades, or burned alive with aviation fuel. Those that did manage to escape the deadly trenches were hunted down in the jungle and along the beaches; in all, thanks in part to native Filipino help, six men managed to escape the camp and make it to American lines where they told their grim tale.  <br /> <br /> As American forces were poised to retake the Philippines, would other massacres occur, or was this an isolated incident? Would it be standard operating procedure for Japanese forces to terminate POWs rather than allowing them to be liberated?  <br /> <br /> American intelligence was aware of a POW camp near the city of Cabanatuan that housed 513 American, British, and Allied POWs, largely remaining survivors from the infamous Bataan Death March after the American loss of the Philippines, the largest surrender in American history. The camp had once held 8,000 prisoners, but disease had taken a toll as well as the fact that in the months preceding most able-bodied prisoners had been sent on ships to Japan or Japanese-held territories to work as slave labor. What was left at Cabanatuan were \\"the dregs, the sickest and the weakest,\\" the \\"ghosts of Bataan\\" as the prisoners called themselves; an \\"elite of the damned\\" that were too starved, weak, and/or sick to prove useful to the retreating Japanese. Located close to 30 miles behind enemy lines, could they be rescued before they were massacred?  <br /> <br /> Fearing time was rapidly running about for these men who had languished in the camp for close to three years, on January 28, 1945 121 specially selected troops from the as yet still largely untested U.S. Army 6th Ranger Battalion, 10 Alamo Scouts, and 280 Filipino guerillas set out on foot to go deep behind enemy lines and liberate the prisoners. Working with numerous source materials, including interviews with survivors (including living Rangers, ex-POWs, and Japanese soldiers), author Hampton Sides put together a vivid narrative of the bold mission, a mission that was much lauded in the day but was quickly eclipsed by later events such as the invasion of Iwo Jima and the bombing of Hiroshima, an epic tale perhaps not that well known to today's readers. He did a good job portraying the personalities of several of the Rangers, notably Lieutenant Colonel Henry Mucci, commanding officer of the 6th Ranger Battalion, Captain Robert Prince, the assault commander of the Ranger raid on Cabanatuan, and Dr. Jimmy Fisher, the Ranger battalion surgeon.  <br /> <br /> Sides not only recounted the rescue mission; in alternating chapters he detailed the experiences of those who endured the Bataan Death March, from their initial surrender, the March itself (grimly referred to as the \\"Hike\\" by the POWs), to their various experiences in the prisoner camps up to their liberation. Much of this, particularly their time on Bataan prior to its fall, the Death March, and their first camp, Camp O'Donnell (the latter was extremely macabre and disturbing, a place where scores died daily), made for very grim reading. It is one thing for someone to rattle off a list of tropical diseases, but another thing entirely to read first hand what amebic dysentery, cerebral malaria, beriberi, and diphtheria can do to a person; these and other disease ran through the prisoners' ranks like wildfire, the prisoners particularly vulnerable owing to their near starvation levels of diets and sometimes near complete lack of vitamins and minerals (indeed a number would go blind and suffer other maladies from a lack of such nutrients, something sympathetic Filipino insurgents would try to combat at Cabanatuan by smugglingin when they could such things as fruit juice).  <br /> <br /> I found it particularly interesting that Sides tried to present a balanced picture of the Bataan Death March. While in no way whitewashing some of the petty cruelty, torture, and outright murder of not only American and Filipino prisoners but even in some cases Filipino bystanders who sought to merely give food and water to the marching prisoners, he does try to show that the horrid conditions of the March were more due in part to bad planning rather than malice. General Masaharu Homma had sought to prepare for the evacuation of the POWs months earlier; having foreseen that this would be a huge logistical problem, he prepared a place called Camp O'Donnell, a former training installation of the Philippine Army located about 75 miles north of Bataan's tip, as a way station for the prisoners. Homma thought that those prisoners who were healthy enough would march, the rest riding in vehicles - marching no more than ten miles a day - and taking a 25 mile train ride for the last leg of the journey.  <br /> <br /> In reality the plan was massively flawed. Homma estimated 25,000 Filipino and American prisoners; in reality there were almost 100,000, which made the amount of food, vehicles, and other supplies planned for completely inadequate. Further, the Japanese were surprised at just how weak the American prisoners turned out to be, how close to starvation many of them were; this combined with the fact that the largely mechanized American army was not used to the amount and level of marching that the Japanese soldier daily endured produced a true humanitarian nightmare.  The trek north to Camp O'Donnell took about a week for the average prisoner, yet owing to the huge numbers of prisoners and their widespread distribution the Japanese needed three weeks to finish the evacuation, during which time 750 Americans and 5,000 Filipinos died, with a further 1,500 Americans and 15,000 Filipinos dying at horrid Camp O'Donnell.  <br /> <br /> An excellent and stirring book, at times grim, exciting, and even humorous.  <br />	2004-12-03

Alter sought to tell the natural history of the elephant as well as its human history on the subcontinent, depicting it in history, mythology, religion, art, and literature. As he notes in the prologue, the somewhat tangential order of the chapters follows a series of journeys the author made in different parts of India in 2001-2002. Roughly chronological, each chapter details his experiences with actual elephants, those who live and work with them, and his viewings of elephant art (as well as many asides about elephants in history, legend, and literature) as he visited various national parks, shrines, museums, and festivals throughout India.  <br /> <br /> I learned many interesting facts about elephant biology; the bull elephant experiences a cyclical period of sexual arousal, known as musth. Similar to the rut of a stag, musth is signaled by excretions from glands on either side of the elephant's forehead (in Indian poetry it is described as being a sweet perfume that attracted bees, though the author found it a \\"sour, oily\\" odor that attracted swarms of flies). Musth can occur any time of the year, though often afflicts elephants in June as monsoon rains begin. Elephants in musth are very temperamental and prone to fits of rage - tame elephants rarely if ever work during musth - and remain this way from a few weeks up to several months.   <br /> <br /> Alter recounted the many differences between African Elephants (_Loxodonta africana_) and Indian Elephants; African Elephants tend to be taller (up to 12 feet at the shoulder versus the Indian being no larger than 10 feet), heavier (African bulls can weigh over 6 tons; Asian bulls closer to 4 tons), have larger ears, rougher hides,more wrinkled trunks, and a differently shaped skull; Africans have a more extended and tapered head while Asians have a flatter face and a more bulging forehead. The tip of the trunk on an African Elephant has two prehensile \\"fingers\\" while the Asian Elephant has but one. In Africa, both male and female elephants posses tusks; in Asia only males have tusks. Even then not all males have them; about 40 percent of all Indian bulls are tuskless and are called makhnas (in fact in some areas, such as Sri Lanka, only 10 percent of all males are tuskers, though this percentage varies a great deal locally).  He discounts notions that the Indian elephant is more easily tamed, noting that simply that there is a considerably longer tradition of such training in India than anywhere else in the world.  <br /> <br /> The elephant has a tremendous role in Indian religion. One example is Ganesha or Ganapati, the elephant-headed deity, bearer of joy and good fortune and son of Shiva and Parvati, who is worshipped for ten days every year in temporary shrines called mandals in the state of Maharashrta, at the end of which clay statues of Ganesha are paraded through the streets and immersed in the Arabian Sea. Ganesha is often depicted with a broken tusk and often any elephant that has only one tusk is called a \\"Ganesha.\\"  <br /> <br /> Literature about elephants -whether factual or fanciful - has long dominated India writings. Gajashastra, or \\"elephant science,\\" was studied and recorded in ancient texts, themselves based on much older oral traditions, recorded in such pieces as _Hastyayurveda_, a part of the classic Sanskrit canon, and the _Matangalila_, a piece of Gajashastra composed by the Sanskrit poet Nilakantha. The latter book divided elephants into three castes; the bhadra, or noble tusker (suitable for carrying royalty); the manda (slow and dependable ordinary elephants), and the mriga (relatively lean, long-legged, and fleet-footed elephants). These texts have proven to be quite accurate and insightful, showing a real understanding of elephant physiology and training.  <br /> <br /> The elephant has long been a prized target of the hunt or shikar, both before the age of British imperialism and during the days of the British Raj, though by and large elephants were more likely to be captured than to be shot (or as some of the shikaris of the Raj said, the elephant was \\"something one shot from, not at\\"), nevertheless solitary tuskers were often misrepresented as rogues and were judged to be fair game. More often attempts were made to catch elephants for use by the military, logging, and by royalty; methods varied greatly from digging a deep hole in the ground and covering it with bamboo, dirt, and grass to mela shikar (riding tame elephants into a wild herd and lassoing selected elephants with grass ropes) to khedah (involving driving herds into large wooden stockades by groups of beaters).  <br /> <br /> Alter spent a great deal of time talking to those who handled elephants. Most tame elephants in India have two or three handlers; the mahout is responsible for the elephant's training and daily maintenance  while the charrawallas (fodder cutters) assist him, their jobs being to collect fresh leaves and grass, keep the stables clean, and give the elephant its daily bath (often the charrawallas work as apprentices, aspiring to become mahouts themselves). <br /> <br /> Elephants are still kept in large numbers in captivity, with India possessing 3,500 captive animals (and 28,000 wild ones out of 50,000 wild elephants in Asia and 16,000 total in captivity). They are still used in a limited way in logging; for years they were vital in this capacity owing to their ability to traverse difficult terrain and move huge loads (now they are still found in forests but often used to patrol against elephant, rhino, and tiger poachers). Many temples and private individuals provide elephants for rent essentially, as their mere presence in weddings is considered auspicious. Rides on the back of elephants are important in tourism, not only for foreign tourists but those from other parts of India.  <br />   <br />	2004-11-28
US	52590451	R140VPGRFHM34I	060980815X	413267055	Preserving the World's Great Cities: The Destruction and Renewal of the Historic Metropolis	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Truly excellent book on the great cities of the world	In March of 1995 author Anthony M. Tung journeyed to 22 of the world's greatest cities in order to study how architectural preservation had failed and succeeded in some of the most artistically and historically significant urban areas around the globe. Having served for many years as a member of New York City's Landmarks Preservation Commission, Tung sought to understand how the complex issue of urban conservation was handled around the world and to gather in one book a body of very basic information about this practice.  <br /> <br /> Until the 20th century, each new stage of architecture and construction referred substantially to previous stages; in Western culture, there was a \\"direct aesthetic line\\" connecting the architecture of classical Greece, imperial Rome, the Romanesque period, the Renaissance, the Baroque, the Rocco, and all forms of classical revival that followed, with even divergent traditions like French Gothic or English Tudor making use of common architectonic elements. Cities tended to be harmonious, each new generation of buildings blending with older buildings to a great degree.  <br /> <br /> In the 20th century however, many age-old aesthetic traditions were abruptly discarded by a modern, new, jarring architecture, built often at vastly different scales than older buildings, of completely different materials, built with new methods, buildings that were consciously designed to have a complete lack of relationship with the previous continuum of form. In Cairo for instance skylines once dominated by domes and minarets of mosques are now ruled by looming massive hotels. Massive gray residential slabs now dominate the remaining parts of historic Moscow. In some cases, as in New York, new buildings were built over and around preserved historic buildings, making them appear toy-like and ridiculous. Further, these buildings of alien scale and design often hopelessly fractured any urban architectural harmony, often forever, as what was destroyed can either never be replaced or only replaced at great financial, legal, political, and economic cost. <br /> <br /> Older cities of handcrafted buildings, made of natural materials from the immediate environment of the city, reflecting the historical values and physical characteristics of unique urban cultures Tung wrote now constitute a \\"finite resource from a closed period of human cultural evolution.\\" Much of the unique architecture of the world's great cities - ancient Roman ruins, the cross-cultural traditions of Singaporean pernanakan architecture, buildings that show a great \\"specialness of place\\" - is still in danger in many places of being replaced by a global monoculture, of older unique buildings being replaced by comparatively poorly constructed structures that are generic in design and that differ little in response to local environmental and social surroundings.  <br /> <br /> Why were older buildings replaced? War certainly plays a factor as might be expected, though by and large Tung feels that city residents themselves are responsible for building replacement. Sometimes older handcrafted buildings are replaced for what were laudable reasons, such as slum clearance, attempts to give the poor a better quality of life, though often irreplaceable but fixable buildings were demolished rather than rehabilitated. Some cities, such as Vienna, Charleston, and Amsterdam (which are detailed at length), bucked this trend, either saving old buildings or constructing new public housing with a conscious effort to maintain local architectural traditions. More often than not though making money was the goal; speculative real estate and construction in the name of progress fractured urban landscapes, as out of scale skyscrapers thrust into the London skyline and ugly hotels of poor artistry were erected in Cairo.  <br /> <br /> Sometimes destruction or replacement of older handcrafted buildings seemed nearly unavoidable; Kyoto for instance, largely spared bombing in World War II, for centuries a city with buildings comprised of shoji (sliding walls of light wood frames covered by translucent paper) and tatami (rectilinear straw mats of standardized dimensions that covered the floors), were rapidly being replaced post-war by modern Western buildings that could more easily accommodate such innovations as modern plumbing and electricity. Tung related how this \\"culture of destruction\\" is being reversed, efforts in this regard aided by uniquely Asian views of preservation (often times ancient buildings are wood and are partially or wholly rebuilt periodically, the emphasis often in China and Japan on preserving the original form not as in Europe or America the original material) and permanence (Japanese buildings were traditionally built to withstand natural disasters and wars by being flexible and if destroyed by being easily rebuilt).  <br /> <br /> Sometimes architectural preservation - or destruction - was dictated not by war or by progress but by ideology.  The Third Reich demolished the landmarks of Warsaw as a punitive action against the Poles, Nazi architects purposely identifying key Warsaw buildings and purposefully destroying them (additionally many were destroyed in actual combat). As an act of defiance, Polish architects risked their lives (and quite a few perished for their efforts) to document this heritage before it was destroyed, hiding plans and documents during the Nazi occupation and then completely rebuilding the city as an act of remembrance. <br /> <br /> Tung recounted many successes in his book as well as failures. What are the common denominators in successful preservation? Clearly economic underdevelopment causes decay and destruction of historic assets. In a detailed chapter on Cairo, Tung discussed how the city's massive problems posed by skyrocketing population growth, extensive poverty, and an endemic culture of illegal settlement and corrupt, byzantine bureaucracy have caused residents to perceive conservation as a lesser priority and have created unique environmental challenges to the city's priceless Muslim architecture thanks to air pollution and a rising water table. Citizens of cities have to have in addition to the means of preserving the city a will to do so; while many of the historic districts of New York were listed and are protected thanks to the efforts of the residents of those areas, Venice, despite widespread international support, is decaying as fewer and fewer Venetians actually live in the historic city, not only affecting city politics and budgets as residents of the historic city lose clout to those outside the historic city but by simply not being present to provide such upkeep.  <br />	2004-11-24

Some of these areas had been under imperial control for centuries, yet within a few decades of the end of World War II, all were to one degree or another independent. Parts of the Netherlands East Indies never saw Dutch rule reinstated after the war and those that did only experienced it for five trouble-filled years. France would hang on in Indo-China for only nine years and at the cost of incessant trouble in the south and a major war with the north. While the British in Malaya and Borneo did manage to put down an insurrection and restore economic prosperity, they too would be out within twelve years of the end of World War II.  <br /> <br /> Was there any common denominator in the exodus of European colonial powers in East Asia? Author John Keay says that too many works have focused on one particular colonial power - generally the United Kingdom - and pegged all of the reasons for the end of empire to certain aspects of national politics, economics, and character. Keay has sought in this book to compare and contrast the Dutch, French, British, and American experiences in East Asia, to see if there were any common threads that lead to the rise of independent nations in the region. <br /> <br />  Keay found that all of the colonies were alike in learning first-hand that guaranteed prosperity under their distant imperial masters was at least partially mythic thanks to the worldwide depression of the 1930s as orders for colonial products disastrously declined and the average person in Asia could see that many Europeans were reduced to now unenviable standards of living. The myth of imperial invulnerability was shattered time and again by the incessant advance of Japanese forces in the early days of World War II, exposing to colonial subjects the lack of real imperial power, an absence that the colonial powers had tried to mask by informal and indirect rule and administrative flexibility. Any possible show of imperial force in retaking the colonies during the war evaporated with the sudden Japanese surrender following the atomic bombings; the colonies were simply reoccupied, not retaken, and the imperial powers were deprived of a \\"splendid spectacle\\" to help restore colonial prestige.  <br /> <br /> Further, the author asserted that the Japanese occupation in World War II heightened Asian expectations of independence and gave many at least a passing acquaintance with self-rule despite the fact that the states the Japanese set up during their occupation were generally geared towards supporting their empire and thwarting the goals of the Allies rather than from any sense of benevolence or Asian solidarity on their part. <br /> <br /> The advance of technology in the 20th century he maintained actually served to weaken colonial control, not strengthen it. Though he did not explore this point to a huge degree, Keay wrote that the revolution in communications, \\"impossible to quantify and difficult to incorporate into a historical narrative,\\" had a tremendous impact. Thanks to the advent of the radio, the telegraph, the telephone, and reliable and reasonably fast mail and passenger service (the latter two thanks to the heavily subsidized routes of such companies as Imperial Airways, Air France, and Pan Am) intervention was made much more frequently and on a much wider scale. Ministers in distant imperial capitals - imparted he writes perhaps with \\"a little dangerous learning\\" thanks to a whirlwind tour of the colony by airplane - now ordered policies that the colonial officials would never have advocated before.  <br /> <br /> Keay wrote that neither empire nor the liberation of the colonial people from it served to crated the much vaunted late 20th century Asian economic miracle; rather empire contributed to an already existing continuum. The \\"island-girt\\" Java and South China Seas of the west Pacific rim had always formed an integrated trading basin not unlike the Mediterranean, an area of trade between the Vietnamese, Malay, Chinese, Indians, and Arabs since at least 2000 B.C. European and American colonial realities such as the British East India Company's tolerance of private intra-Asian trade, America's Open Door policy in China, and the inability of the Dutch to withhold free access to the Indies served to strengthen this. Similarly the Chinese commercial networks that dominate the Far East were greatly aided by empire though arguably not created by it.  <br /> <br />To the extent that imperial power was reasserted in the colonies there were local factors at work. The British for instance were able to achieve the success that they did in Malaya thanks to two things. First, Malaya and Borneo were extremely divided as administratively they were broken up into a four-state Federation, five Unfederated States, and several crown colonies (the Straits Settlements) and racially there was real tension between native Malays and the immigrant Chinese and Indian Malayans (if populations of the latter were to be considered from Singapore were more numerous than the native Malays). As a consequence there wasn't any true nationwide nationalism in existence to pose the British; indeed, the British helped create a real sense of Malaysian nationalism, in sharp contrast to the French in Indo-China and the Dutch in the Netherlands East Indies who sought to pit one group against another in their colonies. Secondly, the colonies after the war thanks to exports primarily of rubber were quite prosperous, removing at least one reason for dissatisfaction with colonial rule.  <br /> <br />While Keay provided a very useful catalog of the differences in goals and methods of the various colonial powers, contrasting for instance the importance of politics in Paris and ideasof French culture, religion, and prestige in how they ran their colonies with that of the Dutch experience, heavily reliant on business interests and the willing accommodation of its empire by the British, I found his thoughts on commonality very interesting as well.  <br />	2004-11-10

Producers of the similarly excellent _A Gap in Nature_, the authors this time concentrate not on animals that became extinct in historical times but living, odd, extraordinary animals, many of them quite unfamiliar to me and I daresay many armchair naturalists.  <br /> <br /> The first section is titled \\"The Vertical Terrain\\" and focuses on animals in mountainous terrains, specifically tropical mountains, which can have habitats varying from snow and alpine meadow at the summit to lowland jungle at its base. We meet in this section the Ribbon-tailed Astrapia of New Guinea, a bird of paradise with the longest tail feathers relative to body size of any bird (they are over three times longer than the bird's body). Similarly unusual is the King of Saxony Bird of Paradise, also of New Guinea; in this species the brow plumes of the male bird are over twice the length of the bird's body, looking somewhat like very oddly shaped huge antennae.  <br /> <br /> The second section is titled \\"Motion Specialists,\\" and focuses on species that move in innovative and unexpected ways. The Mysore Slender Loris of India is a lemur-like primate of the thorny acacia forest, notably in that it moves in a slow, deliberate manner, always keeping grasp of the branches with at least three of its limbs, always from above, never from below. <br />  <br /> The third section is called \\"Food & Feeding\\" and details animals with unusual diets and feeding techniques. We meet the Dingiso, a ground-dwelling tree-kangaroo (as contradictory as that might sound) discovered by Flannery himself in 1994 in the wilds of New Guinea. Delacour's Langur from the forests of central Vietnam is a beautiful but poorly studied primate, boasting a \\"pot belly\\" which contains a large stomach that is capable of fermenting the leaves upon whichit feeds. The Curlew-jawed Mormyrid of South America is a freshwater fish with a long proboscis and the ability to generate its own electric field; both are used by the fish to find its aquatic prey, information from both is sent to its brain, the largest relative to body weight of any fish. Pesquet's Parrot of New Guinea looks more like a vulture than a parrot, with a bald-head and a long bill, though it does not feed on dead animals but the droppings of cassowaries (specifically the undigested fruits seeds within the feces). <br /> <br /> The fourth section is \\"Shape-shifters,\\" focusing on animals of unusual shapes and sizes. The Oriental Bay Owl of southern Asia looks like, when at rest, a broken, lichen-covered branch, all but impossible to see. The garish-colored Tomato Frog of Madagascar looks like a ripe tomato, an example of convergent evolution with the poison arrow frogs of the Americas. The authors produce life-sized pictures of the bumble bee-sized Kitti's Hognosed Bat of Thailand and the Bee Hummingbird of Cuba (which weighs only two grams).  <br /> <br /> Section five is called \\"Habitat Specialists\\" and deals with extreme specialists. The Marsupial Mole, Naked Mole Rat, Pink Fairy Armadillo, and the Star-nosed Mole are all striking examples of convergent evolution from different continents. The Sail-Tailed Lizard of eastern Indonesia is a sail-backed river-dwelling lizard, a poorly studied animal that may be a freshwater analogue of the Galapagos Island Marine Iguana. The Asian Giant Softshell Turtle, as its name might suggest, is not protected by a hardshell at all, something that was dispensed with for mysterious reasons. It is able to live in the polluted Ganges River and the canals of Canton and Jakarta, feeding on just about anything. The Yellow-Headed Picathartes of West Africa is a bald-headed bird that feeds exclusively on insects that breed in bat guano.  <br /> <br /> The final section is titled \\"The Vertical Ocean\\" and has some of the mostunusual animals and evocative illustrations in the book. The stars of this part are marine animals from both the surface waters and the deepest abyss. The male Strap-toothed Whale and the Dense-Beaked Whale produce huge overgrown, curving tusks that when fully developed permit their jaws to only open a few centimeters (it is not known how the up to 7 meter long animals continue to feed). The Crested Basketfish has highly developed pectoral and pelvic fins that produce a virtual net in front of its head, a device that is believed to either sieve the water or to enwrap prey. The nightmarish Stoplight Loosejaw looks like as if it has had its throat coat; its jaws, stripped down to skin, bone, and tendons are constructed to allow for extremely rapid action. The Jellyfaced Spookfish of the very deep Indian Ocean (found two and a half kilometers below the surface) appears to have a head made of jelly, so transparent one can see the veins and arteries carrying blood to its brain and mouth.  <br /> <br /> The authors caution that one of the 97 animals in the book is imaginary; completely made up just for the book. Several times when reading about an animal I had to stop and wonder if that was the animal that existed on in the imagination. Was it the 34 millimeter long Pygmy Chameleon? The Bougainville Monkey-Faced Bat (found in the remote Solomon Islands, having evolved large, hard, pointed teeth and chewing muscles so powerful that their skulls have developed bony crests, enabling the animal to tackle even young coconuts)? Or maybe the Falanouc of Madagascar, once classified as an insectivore but now recognized as an unusual carnivore, a vaguely fox-like animal that lives in small family groups or solitarily on the forest floor, feeding on frogs and insects?  A beautiful and informative book, I highly recommend it as this work does not focus on what some have titled charismatic megafauna (i.e. over-exposed and well- known animals like lions or giant pandas) but often quiteobscure animals, all of which are beautifully illustrated.  <br />	2004-11-09

Variously termed the Fourth Global War (the Third being the Cold War), the U.S.-Jihadist War, the U.S.-Al Qaeda War, or the U.S.-Islamist War, the very fact that three years into it that there is no agreed upon name is indicative of the ambiguous and divisive nature of the conflict.<br /><br /> Friedman traces the origins of Al Qaeda to the mujahideen of the Soviet war in Afghanistan, a force trained and supplied by the U.S., recruited and financed by Saudi Arabia (with Pakistan playing a vital role as well), a program initiated by the Carter administration and expanded by Reagan. While not condemning the operation, as Friedman believes that the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan was a key element in beating them in the Cold War, the operation did sow the seeds of Al Qaeda. These mujahideen were educated, battle-hardened, and very ideological - and not at all wanted back by their home governments (chiefly Saudi Arabia). Abandoned also by the Americans, incensed by the presence of Christian nations on holy Saudi soil during the first Gulf War, and increasingly intolerant of corrupt, American-supported regimes in the Islamic world, they sought to attack the U.S. chiefly because they wished to wound the country in such a way as to force it into intervening massively in the Islamic world. Such an intervention - preferably an invasion - would Al Qaeda hoped provoke a Muslim uprising, overthrowing regimes and ideally restoring the medieval Caliphate.<br /><br /> Friedman detailed the operational strengths and weaknesses of Al Qaeda. The original mujahideen were quite experienced with covert operations, largely from having worked side-by-side with the CIA, seeing first hand American covert operation tactics and technology. Al Qaeda expanded this knowledge by among other things continually testing U.S. intelligence in the 1990s, provokingthe system to see what responses were generated, checking for leaks in their organization, etc. Not only was this reflected in part by the African embassy bombings and the attack on the _U.S.S. Cole_ but also by the constant \\"chatter\\" that is heard worldwide (as an added bonus for Al Qaeda this chatter can also saturate the intelligence system, rendering it less sensitive to real threats).<br /><br /> The book details the entire strategic views of the United States, from pre-war to today. Friedman states that the U.S. was caught flat-footed by 9-11; not only was it tactically surprised, but it was strategically surprised (far greater than say Pearl Harbor, as the U.S. knew it was going to war with Japan). The U.S. early on in the war was forced to adapt Cold War plans the best it could to deal with the situation (such as protecting the President on 9-11 and waging war in Afghanistan) but continually had trouble grappling with fighting a global war against a non-state, elusive enemy, one that while heavily involved in Afghanistan was nonetheless not dependent upon on any one nation.<br /><br /> The war against Al Qaeda produced many problems for the administration. There is still a debate on whether to treat at least in some quarters the conflict against Al Qaeda as a law enforcement or a military issue. The FBI, one of the many agencies tasked to find Al Qaeda in the U.S. is primarily a law enforcement agency, not an intelligence agency, and by its very nature is often poorly suited to uncovering cells in the U.S. American intelligence has in the past few decades since the Bay of Pigs been obsessed with verifiable intelligence, everything needing a verified, documented source, rated arbitrarily he says on a scale of 1 to 5. If it does not, it might not make it into a final report or if it does it is severely downplayed.  Assumptions, unverified reports, and leaps of logic might not make it into final reports, perhaps written and filed away - which along with isolated bits of information \\"prove\\" to critics that the government \\"knew\\" something - but may in the end have no influence on decision makers.<br /><br />  Friedman states that the U.S. has two overall strategic goals in the war. First, it is to deny any possibility that weapons of mass destruction would fall into Al Qaeda's hands. The early days of the war saw Washington in a panic about this, particularly concerned with the status of Pakistan's nuclear weapons. Second, the U.S. seeks to change the behavior of countries that for domestic reasons might support Al-Qaeda or otherwise be disinclined to work against them.<br /><br /> A large portion of the book is spent on the war in Iraq. Friedman maintains that the primary though unstated reasons were twofold; to end the perception that it was militarily weak and that Al Qaeda was going to prevail in the long run (in particular the U.S. was concerned with Saudi perception), and to provide a strategic base to fight Al Qaeda everywhere in the region; other concerns, though real, were secondary. Though the U.S. has achieved some strategic success in the war, the Iraq war showed many key intelligence failures; that Ahmed Chalabi (chief U.S. candidate for the Iraqi presidency) was an Iranian agent who fed the U.S. disinformation, the U.S. was unaware that the Shiites in Iraq had long ago been organized by Iranian intelligence after Desert Storm, and that Saddam Hussein from the very beginning had intended to fight a guerrilla war.<br /><br /> An interesting book, I liked how Friedman discussed not just military strategy but international politics, detailing  France's stance for instance on the Iraq conflict and American attempts to counter it as well as deals made with Iran and Russia in the fight against Al Qaeda, even Spanish politics following the Madrid bombings. The U.S got heavily involved in South Asian politics as part of the war on terror during the events after the December 13, 2001 attack on India's parliament, an event that might have resulted in another India-Pakistan war.	2004-10-17

Books	4	40	45	N	Y	Interesting introduction to game theory	_Games People Play_ by Eric Berne is a layman-accessible book on psychology chiefly concerned with the concept of game playing, one I found quite interesting.  <br /> <br /> At its most fundamental level, humans according to Berne seek what he terms a \\"stroke,\\" just as infants require actual stroking (whether it be literal stroking, a pat on the head, or a hug) to develop healthy in a psychological sense (and to maintain that health), adults require a \\"stroke\\" as well (which he defines as the fundamental unit of social action). An exchange of strokes is a transaction, which is the unit of social intercourse. Such an exchange might be as little as a very simple greeting or something far more elaborate.  <br /> <br /> Adults have a hunger not only for stimulus and recognition but also for structure of their waking hours. Most of a person's time is structured by an activity (i.e. \\"work\\"), governed by rules called procedures (such as how to bake a cake or fly a plane). Other parts are governed by a person's social programming, which results in ritualistic and semi-ritualistic interchanges with other people, often falling other the general name of \\"good manners\\" (examples include generic work greetings and brief conversations about the weather or health).  Berne terms semi-ritualistic topical conservations as pastimes, such as cocktail party conversations on cars, bad husbands, or finances.  <br /> <br /> A person's individual programming results in what he terms games. Games are not necessarily \\"fun\\" and can be quite grim or serious (as in Berne's book alcoholism falls under game playing). In the end the author wrote that ultimately true intimacy - where social patterning and ulterior motivations give way - is more desirable than either a pastime or a game (both of which are substitutes).  <br /> <br /> Key to structural analysis and an understanding of game play is the concept of the ego state. An ego state is a coherent set of feelings and behavior patterns in an individual, all interrelated. Each person has three such ego states, the exteropsychic or Parent ego state, the individual's parental instincts and experiences and vital to enable one to raise actual children and a state that makes many responses in life automatic, freeing one from the burden of innumerable trivial decisions ; the psychic or Adult state, directed towards an autonomous, objective appraisal and handling of reality, the state most needed for survival; and the archaeopsychic or Child state, representing archaic behavioral patterns fixed in early childhood, where in a person resides \\"intuition, creativity, and spontaneous drive and enjoyment,\\" (the author rejects the term childish as negative and prejudicial).  <br /> <br /> Getting back to the concept of transaction, Berne writes that simple transactional analysis is concerned with determining which ego state provided transactional stimulus and which state responded in a given situation. Transactions may be complimentary, such as Child-Parent interaction, where a fevered child asks for a glass from a nurturing mother; these transactions are expected and are part of natural, healthy human relationships. However, a crossed transaction occurs in which the stimulus is one group of ego-states (such as Adult-Adult, when one asks another for instance where one's keys are) and the appropriate response within that set of ego states (such as Adult-Adult answer on the desk) is not given, but instead the response of another ego state (a Child response might be you always blame me for losing your keys).  <br /> <br /> Crossed transactions may not always be obvious, and these ulterior transactions are the basis for games and the primary subject of this book. Ulterior transactions involve the activity of more than two ego states simultaneously and may be of two main types. Angular transactions involve three ego states, and while ostensibly, on the social level, may be directed between two particular ego states (such as say Adult-Adult), really the ulterior or psychological vector is at another ego state (such as say perhaps a social Adult stimulus designed to and provoking a Child response). A duplex ulterior transaction involves four ego states (such as in flirting; on the surface it might appear Adult-Adult but in reality is Child-Child); most games are of this type of transaction.  <br /> <br /> Games, which he distinguishes from superficially similar procedures, rituals, and pastimes, are sets of complimentary ulterior transactions that progress to a well-defined, predictable outcome. Games are inherently dishonest (by definition procedures, rituals, and pastimes are candid) and the sought payoff is dramatic, often negative for one of the parties involved. The bulk of the book is detailed with classifying and discussing a number of games. Dividing games into seven categories (Life, Marital, Party, Sexual, Underworld, Consulting Room, and Good), he discusses the structure of these games, the roles involved, the sought after payoff, as well as the antithesis of a game, how to recognize and move beyond or end a game. An example is the first game he discusses, that of Alcoholic (which by the way can involve other substances). The central thesis of this game could be written as look how bad I have been and see if you can stop me and the aim, the payoff, is self-castigation. For this game to be played, it requires of course the Alcoholic, as well the Persecutor (the chief supporting role), the Rescuer, and the Patsy (an enabler in some sense). The Social paradigm is Adult-Adult, but in reality the game's Psychological paradigm is Parent-Child. The antithesis is difficult, but in essence involves the therapist moving away from any of the established roles of Persecutor or Rescuer and refusing to play the game.  <br /> <br /> A great many games are discussed in the book, some I found a bit hard to accept, others I readily recognized in my daily life. Most of them were quite sad and negative, particularly ones like Kick Me, See What You Made Me Do, and Frigid Woman, though a very few were constructive and beneficial to society, like Happy To Help and Cavalier. Somewhat chilling to think much of human social interaction if game play, after reading this I don't want to play games!  <br />	2004-10-16
US	52590451	R3J4AOJHN1QDD7	0380787423	532586621	Dust	Books	5	24	26	N	N	Gripping and unique end-of-the-world novel	_Dust_ was a gripping and unique end-of-the-world novel, unlike any that I have read before and I consider myself a fan of the genre. The book is set in the relatively near future, in the first decade or two of the 21st century.  <br /> <br /> The action begins when Richard Sinclair, a paleontologist, working at a scientific research facility near his Long Island home, narrowly escapes with his nine year old daughter Tam - purely by accident - an attack by an unknown entity on his neighborhood. Taking dozens of people by complete surprise, the entity looks like a living black carpet. Killing in minutes innocent bystanders, police officers, and later a television reporter crew (as well as Sinclair's wife), the media dubs the threat motes. As the area is quarantined, Sinclair and other scientists come to the conclusion after a harrowing trip into the infected town that the \\"motes\\" are mites, a massive horde of starving mites that attack and devour literally to the bone anyone that cannot escape them. <br /> <br /> Sinclair and the other researchers of Brookhaven (also called the City of Dreams) discover that the threat of the motes - however bad - is merely the tip of the iceberg and not only the United States but all of humanity faces a grave threat. Looking at data from bee keepers - who were virtually of business - the astronomical rise in orange juice prices, and a host of other bits of data not previously integrated by researchers (bringing to mind for me some of the separate bits of intelligence prior to September 11th), Sinclair and the others come to a startling conclusion; the world's insect have vanished. They have all died out, disappeared completely, and this seemingly good bit of news (at least at first glance, to the uninitiated) rapidly produces vastly dire consequences. With the extinction of fungal gnats (a bit of data an entomologist died procuring), massive fungal blooms are spreading throughout the world's crops (aided by the fact that most of theworld's crop plants are of extremely limited genetic diversity). With no insects to control the fungus (and farmers having gotten away from spraying their crops due the gradual decline in insect pests the last few years), the fungus spreads amok, first wiping out crops in India (precipitating an ugly war between it and Pakistan and Sri Lanka as India seeks to annex areas with uninfected croplands, dragging the U.S. into the conflict), later to other countries. Large numbers of animals die throughout the world - insect eating bats, later, fruit eating-bats (which as they die out no longer pollinate plants themselves), many omnivorous animals, freshwater fish that rely upon larval aquatic insects for food - and with no flies or other insect scavengers to remove the bodies, freshwater throughout the world is rendered toxic by the massive amounts of bacteria that now teem in it. Much of this runoff spreads into the sea, creating low or no oxygen areas, wiping out those fish species not already being depleted by frantic nations desperate to replace declining crops as a food source. Even the motes are a result of the end of insects; no longer held in check by insect predators nor having to compete with insects, reach plague proportions in some areas, once harmless mites killing hundreds of people.  <br /> <br /> Things of course in this novel get worse, much worse. The economy goes into a freefall in the United States as non-mote infected areas refuse to have anything to do with those under quarantine or even suspected of having a mote problem. Entire industries collapse, such as the trucking industry, while those reliant on trucking, such as grocery stores which need regular shipments of goods, collapse as well. As crops start to fail in the United States and as gasoline starts to become scarce thanks to a broken down transportation system, riots begin to happen. Stepping into these chaotic and turbulent times is Jerry Sigmond, a corrupt former talk-show host with unfortunately real skills in making others into fanatical followers of a new mass movement he begins to lead, one that sees scientists and engineers (\\"eggheads\\" and \\"Einsteins\\") as the real cause of all these problems. Sigmond emerges as a major villain in the book and a direct threat to Sinclair's efforts.  <br />  <br /> But wait! It gets worse! In some of the scariest parts of the book - it is a horror story after all, though one firmly grounded in science fact with an extensive non-fiction epilogue and bibliography - vampire bats emerge as a villain (yes you read right). The booming cattle industry of Central and South America unfortunately becomes infected with Mad Cow disease and the disease jumps vectors. Transmittable now by vampire bats -which won't feed on sick cattle - they move onto humans, wiping out virtually the entire population of several Caribbean islands as they move in vast numbers from the mainland in search of food. Those that do not die directly from being fed on (a harrowing chapter described one such incident where two researchers meet a very unfortunate demise), die from rapid onset of the disease, a disease that was to have major repercussions in the novel's endgame. <br /> <br /> A very enjoyable novel, I found myself really rooting for Sinclair as he and his colleagues race to uncover the nature of the problem - the sudden demise of insects worldwide - and conclude that it is perhaps due to a genetic \\"timebomb,\\" that the Earth's mass extinctions approximately every 33 million years are not due to a comet or asteroid impact but from the dormancy of the world's insect species (in a manner not unlike the massive periodic bamboo die offs in China that nearly wipe out the pandas periodically). They race to find a solution to this, working in an increasingly chaotic world, working with research stations in other parts of the world that one by one gradually drop off the face of the earth in the growing chaos. A gripping book, it had an action-packedending.  <br /> <br />	2004-10-08

Interstellar travel does not exist yet but the solar system is being explored and is on the verge of colonization. Previous works in this series have explored Mars, Jupiter, Venus, the asteroids, and the Moon. The subject of this novel, as one might imagine from the title, is Saturn. <br /> <br /> Or I should say one might think that it was Saturn. Though most of the other works in the series spent a great deal of time on the titular place of that particular book, we don't actually get to Saturn until around the last quarter of the book or so. Though Saturn - or I should say its rings - does get pretty good treatment towards the end (where there is a real surprise within the ring system), the book does not really embrace the planet the same way _Jupiter_ dealt with Jupiter or _Venus_ really immersed the reader in that particular planet.  Saturn's moon Titan is discussed fairly often in the book but the action never moves at all to that fascinating satellite.  <br /> <br /> Instead, the focus of _Saturn_ is the space habitat _Goddard_, a massive tubular construction that was designed to provide a home for 10,000 people for 5 years in orbit around Saturn (taking around 2 years to arrive). Inside _Goddard_ are villages, streams, forests, fields, and farms, all built along the inside of the rotating space habitat. Essentially except for the endcaps the entire interior surface of the cylindrical space station is covered in buildings and vegetation, designed to provide an Earth-like home to its inhabitants as well as food, oxygen, and all the other necessities. Of the ten thousand people a significant portion are scientists and technicians though there are also farmers, administrative personnel, factory workers, security guards, medical personnel, and food service workers. <br /> <br /> More to the point the focus of _Saturn_ are the peopleand politics of the space habitat. The majority of the ten thousand on the habitat are people who for one reason or another are unhappy with the religious and generally authoritarian regimes on Earth, either seeking to flee it or having been asked to leave by their government (in a matter not unlike the Pilgrims leaving England in the 17th century perhaps, or maybe the convicts sent to Australia). Earth, at least in Europe, North America, and the Middle East, is ruled by religious fundamentalist regimes, having come to power after the chaos and environmental disruptions caused by global warming.  <br /> <br /> Though the religious governments - notably the Holy Disciples in Europe - want these intellectual malcontents out of their hair, they don't want them to have a \\"godless\\" government on the habitat either. One of the main characters of the novel is Malcolm Eberly, someone the Disciples recruit from a prison in Vienna. An adept schemer and manipulator, they instruct him to gain control of the government of _Goddard_ as it reaches Saturn and steer is population towards a politically correct path. Once on the habitat though Eberly seeks power himself, not through rough coercion but through adept politics, subterfuge, and manipulations of individuals and of the people of _Goddard_ as a whole. <br /> <br />Much of the book focuses on Eberly's struggle for power and those who aid or oppose him.  One such persion is Ruth Morgenthau, a Holy Disciples spy sent to control and \\"guide\\" Eberly in his political machinations and when he eventually gains control of the habitat. Colonel Kanaga, a Rwandan security officer, along with the treacherous, power hungry Dr. Sammi Vyborg in the Communications Department form a coterie with Morgenthau and Eberly in their attempts to control the habitat, an effort that eventually devolves into murder. James Wilmot is the official head of the habitat, ostensibly opposed to them, an anthropologist by trade who has a somewhat odd, detached view of politics and society on _Goddard_, viewing the entire operation as a grand experiment, the reasons for this being revealed at the end. A more active opponent is the station's chief scientist, Dr. Urbain, an arrogant though honest and politically nave man opposed to Eberly.  <br /> <br />The protagonists of the book - though I would like to add it wasn't always clear whether or not Eberly was a good guy or a bad guy, particularly at the end - include Holly Lane, a \\"reborn\\" person (someone who endured cryogenic sleep after dying from a deadly illness, being reawakened in the future once a cure existed but like all cryogenic patients having no memory at all, having to relearn even to walk and speak) who is on the habitat to get a new life for herself, away from her sister on the lunar city-state of Selene. My favorite character was the womanizing stuntman Manuel Gaeta, journeying to Saturn on _Goddard_ to film his descent to the surface of Titan, hoping to be the first man to ever do so (an effort bitterly opposed by the habitat's scientists, chiefly Dr. Urbain). Gaeta is also being employed by Holly's sister to watch over her, fearful over her future on _Goddard_. Another protagonist is Dr. Kris Cardenas, the solar system's brilliant expert on nanotechnology, a technology greatly feared and banned on Earth, who joins the expedition en route.  <br /> <br />Having said that the book does not focus much on Saturn per se I still enjoyed. I liked several of the characters and found them fairly engaging. I was riveted by the power struggles on the habitat - though fair disclosure, I read the book while traveling in a car for ten hours this past weekend - and was quite interested to see how it turned out. With the few surprises thrown in at the end I enjoyed _Saturn_. Not the best of his \\"Grand Tour\\" series, I still liked it. If you have read others in this series I think you will enjoy it too.  <br />	2004-10-04
US	52590451	RK4QDPY331UDA	0060505915	581879090	The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements (Perennial Classics)	Books	5	24	27	N	Y	Brilliant and concise treatise on mass movements	The True Believer_ by Eric Hoffer is a short though rather intense and pithy book. His basic premise is that there are traits common to all mass movements, whether they are religious, social, or nationalist in nature. He stresses that while not all movements - and followers of such mass movements, the titular true believer - are identical nevertheless (be they Communism, the French Revolution, Islam, or Christianity) all share certain essential characteristics.  He also stresses that he is not making value judgments; that while few would dispute that Nazism was evil many mass movements produced positive benefits (for instance the rapid modernization of Japan and Turkey would not have been possible without a revivalist nationalist movement). <br /> <br /> The true believer in any mass movement shares many key characteristics. One is that he or she is discontented and blames the world for his or her problems. Second is that he possesses some sense of power, whether real or imagined (those who are in awe of the world he wrote do not think of change, no matter how miserable); the true believer is not destitute, as those who are living hand-to-mouth, unsure of food on a daily basis, don't join mass movements. Moreover, this power comes from some powerful doctrine or infallible leader and through these things the believer feels he has power. Third, the true believer has a great deal of faith in the future, that he believes that tremendous change is possible. Fourth, the true believer is inexperienced, that generally he is nearly completely ignorant of the difficulties involved in a movement's massive undertakings.  <br /> <br /> Hoffer identified several of the appealing elements of mass movements to individuals. Though mass movements in their more mature stages attract those who seek self-advancement, they generally at first are appealing to those who seek self-renunciation. They see their lives - and the present in which they live -as irredeemably spoiled. These peopleseek a rebirth and wish to lose themselves in a mass movement.  The true fanatic of a movement is always incomplete and insecure, only finding assurance through whatever he desperately clings to. Hoffers wrote that fanatics sometimes switch movements entirely and the truest fanatics in any movement have more in common with the fanatics in other movements than with moderates, sometimes one becoming the other (Saul becoming Paul, radical Communists becoming radical Nazis, etc.). The fanatic seeks to deal with a pressing sense of self insufficiency with a strong missionary zeal to proselytize and dominate the world.  <br /> <br /> What types of individuals seek the self-renunciation, rebirth, and transformed future offered by a mass movement? The \\"new poor\\" are a key group, those that have a memory of better times, of more affluence and often more power but through circumstances have been deprived of them. The \\"free poor\\" are another vital group. Hoffer wrote that freedom \\"aggravates as much as it alleviates frustration.\\" Freedom of choice places the blame of failure in life squarely on the shoulder of the individuals; they are free to fail and they would rather seek freedom from responsibility. The free poor - perhaps recently freed slaves, perhaps those who once lived under a despotic regime and came to dislike the following anarchy - often seek freedom from being free, valuing equality and fraternity much more than they value freedom. They find in a mass movement a refuge \\"from the anxieties, barrenness, and meaninglessness of an individual existence.\\"  <br /> <br />Hoffer stressed however that not all poor people join mass movements; as noted the abject poor do not join them, nor do those he called the \\"unified poor,\\" those who are members of compact, tightly knit groups that provide solidarity and support (such as in the past the Chinese family or the Jewish ghettos in Medieval Europe). Leaders of mass movements he noted were aware of these groups and often soughtto disrupt or destroy them.  <br /> <br />Once within a mass movement the true believer is assimilated. This is facilitated by \\"make believe\\" - activities such as parades and by wearing uniforms - that stress the glory of a movement, carrying away viewers by sheer spectacle. Leaders of a mass movement deprecate the present, encouraging a negative attitude to the world as it is and fixing the attention upon the future. Doctrine is key in this, a \\"fact proof screen\\" that insulates the individual from the world, a doctrine that is deliberately not wholly intelligible and that requires no small amount of faith to follow.  <br /> <br /> Mass movements themselves have many similarities. First, all mass movements are competitive. Second, all mass movements are ultimately interchangeable, either changing in character or possessing more than one character, as a religious movement may become a nationalist one or vice versa. For instance Zionism can be seen as a nationalist, social, and religious movement. Third, while mass movements do not require a God they do require a devil, something to focus their wrath on (and if an enemy does not exist it must be invented).  <br /> <br /> For a mass movement to come to pass, three types of leaders at different stages are required. More often than not, each of these leaders is a different person. First is the man of words, an articulate and intelligent person who undermines faith in the existing order and sets the stage for a mass movement. When conditions are ripe the second leader, the fanatic, appears, one who is comfortable in a world of chaos and is not interested in reform but rather revolution, moving beyond mere dialogue - however important - and enacting real change.  However, while a mass movement is pioneered by the man of words and materialized by the fanatic, it is consolidated by the man of action, a person who has experience and can consolidate and stabilize the gains made by fanatics. Those movements that lack this person can burn out, destroyed in trying to achieve ever more impossible goals. The man of action saves a movement from suicidal dissensions and the recklessness of fanatics.  <br /> <br /> An excellent book, it was well worth reading.  <br />	2004-09-30

Its probably most famous weapon was its torpedo, which weighed 1,610 pounds and was capable of sinking a 10,000 ton ship in minutes. To deliver this weapon - often against intense fire and in daylight though nighttime raids were more common - the pilot was taught to attack from a steep dive, at a speed of 180 knots or more and then straightenout and fly at a mere 90 knots (producing a very vulnerable target).  <br /> <br />  A tremendously maneuverable aircraft that was difficult to stall, the Swordfish was the only British aircraft that was flying at the outbreak of the war and still flying against the enemy in 1945. It had a stalling speed of 55 knots and could out maneuver but not outrun virtually every airplane in the sky and for good reason; it was a biplane. In many ways the Stringbag as it was also called was an obsolescent aircraft. It was very slow and poorly armed; equipped only with World War I era forward firing Vickers gun and a rear cockpit mounted Lewis gun fired by the air gunner or the observer. It had to rely on deft maneuvers, nighttime operation, and secrecy to survive against much more modern aircraft. It had an open cockpit (brutal when operating for instance in the North Sea), didn't have radar, and lacked a sensitive altimeter (at least in the beginning of the war), a crucial bit of equipment as the rather temperamental torpedoes had to be dropped from a height of 60 feet, no more and no less. Aircraft to ship communications were difficult - when they weren't blacked out dueto the security concerns - so the possibility of not finding the carrier upon completion of a mission was a real possibility (and one that occurred several times).  <br /> <br /> Despites its shortcomings the Swordfish played an impressive role in World War II. Lamb provided a riveting (thought at times strangely humble and sometimes even understated) account of his actions in the war as a Swordfish pilot. He was there from the very beginning of the war, his 815 Squadron's history a \\"constant repetition of involvement in campaigns which ended in German victory\\" despite heroic efforts to the contrary; he saw some dark days indeed when days into the war his carrier the _HMS Courageous_ was sunk by a U-boat, laid mines off the German coast, attempted to stem the advance of Germany into the Netherlands, flew over Dunkirk to provide cover for the retreat, and operated against the Axis first in Greece and later from a secret base in Albania, in both cases forced to retreat as the enemy overran his position. He was involved in some very notable success, in particular the epic raid on the Italian fleet in Taranto Harbor and in virtually ending the shipment of goods to Rommel in North Africa.  <br /> <br /> About the first two thirds/three fourths of the book recounts his days flying against the enemy (with a small section at the beginning of the book describing his entry into the world of naval aviation and the interwar years in British military aviation). The last section of the book describes Lamb's unfortunate experiences in a Vichy French interment camp (most of his stay was at Laghouat, a facility in southern Algeria, deep in the Sahara). Caught while doing cloak and dagger missions, landing operatives in Vichy French territory, the book completely changes in style and tone in the part recounting his months in the camp as Lamb details the revolting conditions and the horrid Vichy French and Arab jailers. Though I knew obviously (or at least probably) that Lamb escapedas he survived to write the book - his post World War II days are recounted at the very end - I did not know for sure how he would get out of the camp and found that section quite engaging, the tale filled with stories of torture, escape attempts, and guards both cruel and sympathetic. Suffice it to say he did manage to survive that ordeal and even served in the Pacific against the Japanese.  <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have to offer about the book is that several times Lamb provided dialogue in French from his captors without a translation. I do not speak French, and while I could puzzle out some of the passages, either through my limited exposure to French (as well as other languages) or through context, I wasn't always able to do so. I have seen this before in other works both fiction and non-fiction and have never cared for it then either. The author didn't do this too frequently so this is not a major complaint.  <br /> <br /> All in all it was a very good book and I one I really enjoyed. This edition has black and white illustrations of every aircraft even mentioned in passing in the book which I liked, as well as a few maps. It provided to me some insight into the Mediterranean theater of operations, something I don't know as much about as I would like, as well as a view of the Vichy French in North Africa, and even the American role prior to Pearl Harbor (among other things Lamb recounts the actions of the American diplomat in Vichy French territory - officially neutral - in trying to help the British internees).  <br />	2004-09-24

Books	5	14	14	N	N	A great  history book, both a quick read and epic in scope	Jack Weatherford has written a wonderful book on the topic of tribal or \\"primitive\\" cultures, generally nomadic, often pastoral ones in world history and today, seeking to explore the relationship between tribal peoples and the people of cities and what is thought of as civilization. The fact that these people have gone by so many names throughout history, whether stigmatic names like barbarian, savage, pagan, or heathen or more modern less pejorative names like ethnic group, folk tradition, or national minority shows that urban cultures have generally had a difficult time coming to grips with those outside the mainstream of global civilization.<br /><br /> Weatherford covers a great deal of history in his discussion of tribal cultures. He visits with and discusses the Australian aborigines; those that still have their traditional hunting and gathering lifestyle, he writes, with slight modifications, could have lived almost any time in the last 200,000 years in the temperate and tropical zones of Africa, the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Australia (covering something like 99 percent of human history). The modern Aleuts and Inuit of North America, the Sami or Lapps of Scandinavia, and such northern Siberian peoples as the Yakut and Chuckhi represent remnants of the thousands of such groups from the last Ice Age, groups that had to give up foraging and worked in groups to hunt the massive megafauna of the Arctic regions, whether mammoths or whales.<br /><br />The fact that tribal peoples did not settle into the dense concentrations that urban peoples did and many tribal groups had relatively few domesticated animals would have a profound impact upon world history. An interesting point he makes involved pastoral people and disease; virtually every infectious or epidemic disease known among human has a close animal counterpart (smallpox is similar to cowpox in cattle and myxomatosis in rabbits, measles has similarities to distemper in dogs and rinderpest among bovines) and those cultures that did not have much in the way of domesticated animals (such as the Polynesians and Native Americans) were free of these epidemic diseases.<br /><br />Weatherford wrote that the political and technological interaction between the wandering tribal peoples and civilized peoples for the three thousands years between 1600 B.C. and 1500 A.D. was the focal point of Eurasian civilization. Once indigenous people played a huge role in world history, one group occasionally assimilating the other or forcing millions to move in vast relocations. In some cases the nomads were technological innovators (inventing the horse-drawn chariot and the stirrup, for a time dominating urban peoples until they in turn assimilated these new inventions), in other cases acting as conduits for technological change (the Mongols for instance borrowed animals, ideas, and technology from all parts of their territories, spreading them from Europe to China). For centuries there was, despite the conflicts, a symbiotic relationship between farmers and nomads, as one helped the other (the former supplying cereals, tea, sugar, metal-working, and chemicals for leatherworking, the latter important in bringing in exotic items and introducing new products and ideas); this has been obscured by the fact that most written records about the nomads were left by the settled agricultural peoples and were often biased against the nomads. On occasion this was recognized; North African scholar Ab-ar-Rahman Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406) wrote the first historical analysis of the relationship between tribal and urban people; he said that the city people needed the tribal people because the latter reinvigorated the civilized world, bringing in new blood and new ideas (such as Islam and Judaism). They brought a simple, direct, honest way of dealing with the world, a strength that accounted for the success of the Hebrews against the Canaanite cities, the Arab Bedouins in the Middle East, and the Moors in Spain(among others). However, the longer tribal people associated with urban people, the weaker they became. Weatherford makes the point that this assertion of Ibn Khaldun's was predated by the Old Testament of the Bible (evident in how the Hebrews viewed the corrupt cities of Jericho, Sodom, and Gomorrah), unique in being one of the few texts by a nomadic group.<br /><br /> Weatherford definitely wrote what some might call a \\"big picture\\" analysis of world history. He devotes several chapters to how eventually the urban peoples of the world came to complete dominate tribal cultures. He wrote that it took roughly 8,000 years for a truly world economy to emerge, the time between the first agricultural village and the start of the first trans-Pacific route from Acapulco to Manila (via the famed Spanish Manila galleon). This process required three major technological and social breakthroughs; the unification of Asia and Europe via the horse (made possible by the invention of stirrups, bridles, and saddles), the connection of sub-Saharan Africa with the Mediterranean world via the camel, and the voyages connecting Europe and Asia across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans (made possible by the mastery of celestial and compass navigation and by paper and the invention of the printing press and movable type to maintain contact over thousands of miles and to aid in the creation of modern nation states by standardizing language, culture, and national identity).<br /><br /> I can only give a very brief introduction to this book. Though a quick read, it is epic in scope. Later chapters are devoted to how tribal peoples were treated during the age of imperialism, the advent of anthropology (the \\"study of the exotic by the eccentric\\"), and the future of tribal peoples today (which ironically may be aided by technology as it has aided widely separated people to maintain touch with one another and facilitated broadcasting and printing in tribal languages).<br /><br /> I enjoyed how the author opened many chapters with personal experiences. They ranged from traveling by camel in the Sahara to drinking chicha (homemade corn beer) in the isolated town of Pocona, Bolivia, to recounting experiences with the Kuna of the San Blas Islands of Panama, the only Native Americans visited by Christopher Columbus that are still alive.

Genre fans may remember the 1980s movie _Final Countdown_, where a modern _Nimitz_ class aircraft carrier accidentally time travels back to just days before the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Though we did get to see F-14s deal with a few Zeros if memory serves, the movie didn't fully explore what could have happened had modern equipment and personnel suddenly appeared during that conflict._Weapons of Choice_ does that and more.   <br /> <br /> The book opens in the year 2021. An international fleet of warships - largely American but importantly including British, Japanese, Australian, and Indonesian vessels - are on a mission to Indonesia. This multinational armada is tasked with defeating the Caliphate, a revolutionary Islamist regime that has taken over the government of Indonesia, threatening to spread the revolution violently to neighboring nations such as Malaysia and is massacring Christians and ethnic Chinese within the country. The impressive force sent to stop the Caliphate includes a variety of warships, aircraft, and weapon systems that don't exist yet, such as the F-22 fighter, the amphibious warship _USS Kandahar_, the super carrier _USS Hillary Clinton_, and a great deal of futuristic technology including ceramic armament, intelligent battle computers, and biochip implants. <br />  <br /> Also present is the Joint Research Vessel _Nagoya_, an impressive scientific research vessel that was originally stationed off the Australian coast to do high energy physics experiments. When its assigned warship escort was recalled to the multinational task force, it was ordered to accompany it to Indonesia. Resentful over the delay in experimentations, the scientists and crew on the _Nagoya_ continue their projects.  Something goes horribly wrong, an artificial wormhole is created, and most if not all of the international task force is sent backward in time, ending up near Midway in the middle of the Pacific, days before the fateful Battle of Midway in 1942. <br /> <br /> To say much more than that would spoil the book and that would be a shame. One might think that such an impressive fleet would rule the Earth and quickly defeat the Axis powers; that however as the reader will discover is not at all the case. If anything the accidental arrival of the task force may make things better for the Axis nations, at least in the short term.  <br /> <br /> In a tightly written, page-turning narrative Birmingham shows the interaction between the international task force and the soldiers, sailors, military leaders, and politicians of the era and the course of the war after their arrival. The author explores how the people of 1942 view an integrated fleet, possessing many sailors, marines, and officers that are non-white and/or female. The people from the future have the benefit of hindsight, knowing how the war turns out, possessing an advantage, but then the people of 1942 live in this world and possess a lot of knowledge and experience not conveyed adequately in future books and television programs. Slang is different, as are tastes in music, movies, dating techniques, etc.  They have different views on such issues as the Holocaust (a major issue in the future; hardly known to many particularly in the Pacific theater), how to win the war, and how to adequately make use of the weapons that seemed to have been dropped in their lap. Command issues arise (just imagine General Douglas Macarthur and his view over this futuristic force appearing in the Pacific), as do issues of pay, medical issues (the medical personnel from the future are aghast at 1942 medicine)...even the embedded (an unknown word in 1942) reporters don't know who and if they can report to the contemporary news organizations of this time period, as the authorities are unsure how to handle the news of this momentous event! <br /> <br /> Of course, the knowledge, equipment, and personnel from 2021 aren't in Allied hands alone; Birmingham details what happens in Japan and Germany as well. Major characters in the book include Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto and German engineer Major Paul Brasch.  <br /> <br /> As an aside I would like to note that throughout the book the author sprinkles asides, references, and observations about our future history; it appears that up to 2021 the Allied nations have been fighting an irregular war against terrorism, sometimes overt as in among other places Iraq, Afghanistan, and at least as originally planned in Indonesia, sometimes covert. Occasional references are made to September 11th type attacks after 2001, including some with weapons of mass destruction. Though not fully explored, the crew of the multinational task force has come from a world at war, perhaps not as dire as the situation in 1942, but nonetheless a world truly in conflict. <br />   <br /> The first of a trilogy, the second act looks to be action-packed and gripping. I can't wait. This trilogy should appeal to Harry Turtledove fans (there are several throwaway references) and Tom Clancy fans (I think I caught at least one reference to him as well). I highly recommend this book, I read it in about two days.  <br />	2004-09-13

As I knew very little about steamboats before picking up this book, I learned quite a bit.  <br /> <br /> Gillespie produced what he called an anthology, a collection of first person accounts of life on a steamboat, written by a passengers, crewmen, reporters, and members of the military. Much of the book consisted of huge blocks of quoted text, sometimes just a few paragraphs, other times most of a chapter, describing construction, navigation, operation, entertainment on, and military uses of steamboats. Thankfully, Gillespie modified the text of such passages so that spelling and grammar were modern for the most part, though I will have to say once in a while I got tired of reading so many quoted passages. Still, for those interested in this type of vessel it is great primary source material.  <br /> <br /> From the around the start of the second decade of the nineteenth century until the 1880s (Mark Twain proclaimed the era dead in 1882) steamboating was king on the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio Rivers, a 16,000 mile system known collectively as the Western Rivers, which included all of the navigable streams of the Central Basin of the United States, from the Appalachians to the Rockies. Unique in the history of ships (though the they were called boats, no matter how large they got), steamboats were specifically designed for the demands of the Western Rivers. They were built to run in very shallow depths and in narrow confines, primarily on waterways devoid of swells. Propelled by paddlewheels either on the sides or at the stern, they were even able to lift themselves up over shoals, reefs, and sandbars. In their heyday they carried hundreds of tons of cargo and thousands of passengers, making regular runs connecting such cities as New Orleans, Vicksburg, Memphis, St. Louis, and Cincinnati as well as scores of lesser communities that vanished with the arrival of the railroad and the passing of the steamboat era.  <br /> <br /> I had no idea how dangerous steamboating was until I read this book. I had heard of boiler explosions - one of the few things I knew about steamboats - and I had heard of the worst maritime disaster in American history, which involved a steamboat (the explosion and fire on the steamboat _Sultana_ on April 26, 1865 killed 1,547 passengers and crew, a disaster Gillespie covered). The author discusses the nature of fire and boiler explosions - why and how they occur, how they were dealt with, and what was done (if anything) to prevent them - and I found it very interesting. Mechanical defects and shipboard accidents aside however, the river itself presented a whole host of challenges. The Mississippi River was often filled with debris thanks to eroding banks and frequent flooding, especially floating logs. A half-submerged log, unseen at night, forty feet in length and four feet in diameter hitting a wooden hulled steamer could cause terrific damage wrote Gillespie. Planters were logs that became waterlogged at their root end, the still-buoyant top end angled up and forward like a lance to impale an unwary boat; planters sent many ships to a watery grave. Sawyers were very similar; the rooted end was embedded into the bottom, but not so firmly that the tree didn't bob up and down, occasionally breaking the river's surface. Snags were completely submerged trees, often unseen if the current was slight or if light was poor; snags and wrecks of other boats could present huge problems, either as obstructions themselves or by the way they altered the channel of the river, leading even experienced pilots off course. So dangerous were snags and other related obstacles that specially constructed, eventuallyfederally operated snagboats were used to remove them.  Other hazards included low water groundings, ship collisions, severe weather (the author included an account of a ship hit by a tornado), rapids (only on a few areas of some rivers), and bridges (which could create hazardous sailing conditions thanks to currents and eddies created by their support pillars).  <br /> <br /> The author was very thorough; he included an extensive bibliography, charts and diagrams showing steamboat engines and steamboat hull construction (where a reader will learn just what a texas is and the difference between low-pressure and high-pressure engines), and provided thorough coverage of the many types of passengers and crew on these boats (from rousters to mud clerks, pilots to stewards, gamblers to the unfortunate people in deck passage).  <br />	2004-08-12
US	52590451	R1OURKO73MUJWR	0345422031	359626881	Cthulhu 2000	Books	5	20	20	N	N	Very good modern collection of Cthulhu short stories	_Cthulhu 2000_ is (as one might guess from the title) a collection of recently written short stories set in the universe created by H.P. Lovecraft, none by Lovecraft himself but rather by a variety of different authors. Editor Jim Turner provides a nice introduction to the Lovecraft's writings, drawing attention to two themes in the Cthulhu mythos. One theme is that though Lovecraft is in many ways a horror writer, he did not see the universe in terms of some epic, Biblical struggle between good and evil. Turner writes that a conventional horror writer \\"presupposes an actively malicious universe;\\" Lovecraft saw the universe in his stories instead as profoundly indifferent, that the interaction of the laws of physics, chemistry, and biology are so universal and eternal a phenomenon that they are far beyond any meaningful relationship with any species so transient as man, located as he is on such an insignificant planet. Man is a speck, nothing at all, against the horrors in a true piece of Cthulhian fiction. The best he can hope for from the universe is profound indifference. Lovecraft's monsters aren't evil, they just exist, they are almost elemental forces.  <br /> <br /> A second theme, in many related to the first theme, is that the universe is vast and probably unknowable by man. Some of the horror from Lovecraft's writings comes from the \\"finite mind grappling with infinite reality,\\" the results of which are often insanity and/or death.  Lovecraft himself said humans live on a \\"placid island of ignorance\\" amidst \\"black seas of infinity,\\" and that mankind was not mentioned to voyage far. Man is better off not knowing the true horrors that lurk in the shadows. <br /> <br /> So how well do the eighteen short stories in this volume realize these themes? Pretty well overall I think. Many of the stories depart from Lovecraft's typical mode of writing; most of his short stories were tales (memoirs really) told by men after the fact - sometimes dead or insane at the end of the story - rather than actually accounting events as they happened, often lacking dialogue. Though a few of the stories are in Lovecraft's traditional style, most are not. To me this is quite refreshing. <br /> <br /> Several stories to me were exemplary, centering on a seemingly normal person, perhaps an investigator, perhaps not, in what looks like a normal, mundane, mortal world, one that is revealed to be hiding untold horrors unknown to most of humanity. _Black Man with a Horn_ by T.E.D. Klein was an excellent page-turner (I wished it was longer though it was already almost a novella in length), an intriguing tale that wove together elements of Malaysian folklore, a retiring missionary, an elderly horror writer, and some mysterious disappearances in Florida. It had a wonderful atmosphere and the author did a great job of slowly, very slowly, revealing what the horror of the piece was. _The Last Feast of the Harlequin_ by Thomas Ligotti was similarly excellent, the protagonist an anthropological researcher (who specialized in studying the role of the clown in various cultures) traveling to the town of Mirocaw to research a Winter Solstice celebration that was rumored to involve a clown figure. The main character finds more than he bargained for, discovering that there was a great deal more to the festival that initially met the eye.  _The Barrens_ by F. Paul Wilson focused on a researcher and his ex-girlfriend, the former obsessed with the phenomenon of pine lights (eerie will o'wisp like globules of light said to haunt the New Jersey Pine Barrens), an obsession that leads the main characters to view the world in an entirely different light. <br /> <br /> Several stories were a bit more unusual and I am not sure I understood them. _Shaft Number 247_ by Basil Cooper appeared to be set in the far future, underground, in a highly mechanized and regimented society that either could not survive on the surface of the earth or was afraid to. The Cthulhic elementwas subtle, almost slight.  _The Shadow on the Doorstep_ by James P. Blaylock was well-written, almost poetic, describing the author's encounters with mysterious aquarium shops in various places in California as well as what might or might not have been some horrid apparition on his doorstep late one evening, but the horror and mystery in this piece was very subtle, maybe too subtle.  <br /> <br /> A couple of stories were humorous, playing with the Cthulhu mythos but not much in the style of Lovecraft, not that they weren't enjoyable. _Pickman's Modem_ by Lawrence Watt-Evans dealt with as one might guess a demonic modem and its effects on its user and _Love's Eldritch Ichor_ by Esther M. Friesner was almost slapstick, the subject a budding young romance writer (!) with some rather unusual friends. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this book a lot, I find it a fairly quick read and a good continuation of Lovecraft's writings. I would love to see a sequel volume.  <br />	2004-07-30

Author Tom Bissell set out originally to cover the tragic disappearance of the Aral Sea, a once large inland body of water shared by Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan that has been slowly choked to death since the 19th century by diversion of the water to grow cotton. Through the course of the book though he not only covers the Aral Sea but also relates his previous personal experiences with Uzbekistan - he served for a time as a Peace Corps volunteer - as well as his current travels. Though he left the Peace Corps, his love for this Central Asian nation didn't leave him and he felt compelled to return, not only to his host family but to the country in general. <br /> We learn that Uzbekistan is the second largest exporter of cotton in the world; though this achievement has not come without considerable cost (also amazingly enough they grow rice too). That this desert nation relies so heavily economically on such a thirsty plant is unusual, but Bissell details how the American Civil War cut off the supply of cotton, encouraging tsarist Russia to look for a new source.  Demand for cotton only escalated during the Cold War. To grow the cotton, the Amu Darya River (known in antiquity as the Oxus) was diverted. This river, which forms part of Uzbekistan's southern border and the primary source of the Aral Sea's water, now no longer feeds into it at all. The formerly vast river, which once formed a huge inland delta, is now a mere creek at best as it reaches the receding shores of the Aral. <br /> The Aral Sea's certain demise sometime in the first few decades of the 21st century will have ugly consequences. As late as 1960 the Aral Sea was still the fourth-largest inland body of water in the world; now it is largely salt-crusted, dust-storm swept desert, much of this salt and silt poisonous thanks to decades of Soviet insecticides and dumped toxic waste. Moynaq, once a prosperous seaside community thathad 40,000 inhabitants, was a favored beach retreat, and had a cannery that produced 12 to 20 million tins of fish a year; now over a hundred miles from the sea's present (and still receding) shores, it is a near ghost town with no jobs to speak of. Fishing ships lie where they were abandoned, resting incongruously in sand dunes. Now that the Aral Sea has thus far lost over 70% of its water volume it no longer acts to moderate regional temperatures; summers are hotter and winters are colder (possibly ironically dooming the very crops that are being grown at the expense of the sea). The two dozen fish species that were once endemic to the Aral Sea are now extinct (though other species were later reintroduced to the northern Kazakhstan portion). The formerly unique desert forests that surrounded the lake are long gone as well. <br /> More tragic still are those people who live around the Aral Sea. For over 600 years the Karakalpaks, a formerly nomadic people, have called these shores home. Now they are poor and unhealthy, as their industries - fishing, canning, and shipbuilding - have vanished and they suffer soaring rates of infant mortality, tuberculosis, and other diseases directly and indirectly related to the vanished desert sea.<br /> I don't however want to give the impression that this is a grim book, as there are many funny sections in it and Bissell is a talented writer.  Nor is the Aral Sea the only subject covered. It is not even the main subject of this travel essay. Most of the book is devoted to Bissell's travels, most of them with a young Uzbek named Rustam, hired as a translator but becoming a friend as he journeyed throughout Uzbekistan, from the T'ien Shan Mountains and Ferghana Valley in the far east of the nation through Tashkent, Samarkand, and Bukhara. Along the way the author relates many interest aspects of Uzbek history and culture, including the days of the Mongols, Timur (known in the West as Tamerlane), the Samanid dynasty of 819-1005 (during which time Uzbekistan became a center of Islamic learning, producing the great doctor ibn Sina, known to Westerners as Avicenna, revered in the West as late as 1700s, and al-Khorezmi, from whose name the word algorithm is derived), the Great Game (the 19th century Cold War of sorts between Russia and the British for supremacy in Central Asia), and the rule of Islam Karimov. <br /> I found his portraits of the various cities the most interesting aspect of the book. Tashkent for example we learn is not only the most populous city in Uzbekistan but the most populous in Central Asia. It is also one of the most modern seeming Central Asian cities, as there is very little architecture older than about 50 years (owing partly to the fact that the city has been Russified since the late 19th century and partly due to a massive 1966 earthquake). Despite is appearances though this oasis city (its name means \\"Stone City\\") is over 2000 years old, making it one of the oldest extant cities in the world. For much of its history it was a \\"sporadically independent city-state\\" surrounded by a famous high stone wall sixteen miles long (now completely gone) and controlled at times by such various groups as the Arabs, Chinese, Mongols, and the Kazakhs. <br /> Bissell also has many asides in the book about Uzbek culture. He wrote of the very nature of Uzbek, an agreed-upon identity that is less than a century old; that in 1902 a Russian ethnographer noted that there were more 80 clan names in Uzbekistan, more important to them than any \\"Uzbek\\" identity. Indeed, Uzbek history in any form only stretches back to the 14th century, when a fierce group of nomadic invaders came down from the plains of southern Siberia. <br /> A good book, just wish it had pictures.	2004-07-18

Copeland of the destroyer escort U.S.S. _Samuel B. Roberts_ and the most \\"glorious two hours of resolution, sacrifice, and success\\" in the history of the United States Navy according to Admiral Nimitz was how the battle off the Philippine island of Samar on October 25, 1944 was described. Author James D. Hornfischer, using Japanese and American contemporary eyewitness testimony, official reports, and more recent interviews, along with a wealth of photographs and maps, has pieced together a gripping account of this battle.  <br /> Why was the battle so noteworthy? The American combatants of this particular action were a small group; a flotilla designated Task Unit 77.4.3 and given the radio call sign of Taffy 3 and placed under the command of Rear Admiral Thomas L. \\"Ziggy\\" Sprague and assigned a part in the grand scheme to win back the Philippines for the U.S. Two fleets were sent to the islands. One, the Seventh Fleet, was under the command of Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, under the overall command of General Douglas MacArthur (and sometimes called MacArthur's Navy), which had the actual ships - including troop and tank transports and landing craft - of the invasion force itself. The Third Fleet, under the overall command of Admiral Nimitz and sailing under the flag of Admiral Halsey, were assigned the task to guard MacArthur's northern flank and deal with opposing fleets. <br /> Standing guard at MacArthur's back were several groups of combatants from the Seventh Fleet. One was a bombardment group of battleships and cruisers under Admiral Jesse Oldendorf. Another was Task Force 77.4, a force of sixteen escort carriers under Adm. Ziggy Sprague, divided into three task units (of which Taffy 3 was one of them), screened by destroyers and destroyer escorts. Ideally Taffy 3 should have been sandwiched between two huge American fleets and not have tobear the brunt of any concerted Japanese attack; instead its squadrons of FM-2 Wildcat fighters and TBM Avenger torpedo bombers flew cover for the American army ashore, while the destroyers and destroyer escorts protected the escort carriers from submarine or aerial attack.<br /> Unfortunately, the Japanese had other plans. Desperate for a decisive battle that could possibly win them the war; they launched a massive effort to deny the archipelago to the Americans. Designated Sho-Go (Victory Operation) plan 1 (or Sho-1), it was a rather complex plan that required four fleets scattered over thousands of miles to rendezvous with nearly impossible precision. The plan was that land-based aircraft would assault the American carriers while a decoy force of aircraft carriers under Vice Adm. Jisaburo Ozawa led Halsey's Third Fleet north. Exploiting the division of forces, two battleship forces, one under Vice Adm. Takeo Kurita, the other under Vice Adm. Shoji Nishimura, would slip through the waters north of Samar and south of Leyte respectively, catching the Third Fleet and destroying them. The two forces included not only over a dozen cruisers, squadrons of destroyers, and several battleships, it also included two of the largest battleships ever built, the _Yamato_ and the _Musashi_.<br /> Without going into tremendous detail about it here, Halsey takes the bait and goes north, and the battleship group under Oldendorf defeats Nishimura's forces at the Battle of Surigao Strait, but Kurita's forces happen upon Taffy 3. Though partially bloodied by aerial assault, the attacking force still comprises the _Yamato_, three other battleships, six heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and eleven destroyers. Taffy 3, caught well away from any reinforcements, is tiny in comparison; six escort carriers, three destroyers, and four destroyer escorts. None of Sprague's thirteen ships had a gun heavier than a five-incher (often called a \\"peashooter\\"). The 54 pound shells they fired could not penetrate cruiser or battleship armor and had a range of about seven miles. In contrast, even the smallest of the four Japanese battleships could fire 14 inch shells with a weight of 1,400 pounds and a range of more than twenty miles. The Japanese forces were also much faster, easily able to run down and catch the tiny task force. The tiny escort carriers - built on the cheap due to wartime necessity - were not as fast nor as tough as the major fleet carriers, nor did they carry the same number of planes as the bigger _Essex_ class of Halsey's fleet (all six carriers' aircraft compliment was about the same as two fleet carriers); indeed, sailors joked that the acronym CVE for escort carrier really meant combustible, vulnerable, and expendable. The chances were high that surface gun fire from the powerful ships could sink the entire force in minutes. <br /> What chance did Taffy 3 have? The destroyers and destroyer escorts carried torpedoes, which while able to damage or even destroy a battleship required them to close to a suicidal range with capital ships in broad daylight, about 10,000 yards at most. The Avengers did carry some ship-killing weapons, such as torpedoes, but most were either unarmed or geared more for ground support roles, with light antipersonnel weapons; there was no time to properly equip the aircraft so sudden was the appearance of Kurita's forces. <br /> The majority of the book chronicles this desperate struggling against huge odds. The pilots bombed and strafed the ships as best they could, even making dry runs after they ran out of ammo in an attempt to get the ships to alter course even slightly, to buy any time they could for the fleeing escort carriers. The tiny escort ships charged bravely ahead, launching their torpedoes and firing their 5 inch guns, while the flattops fled. Against nearly impossible odds, Taffy 3 prevailed. While some of its ships were sunk and there was loss of life, the tiny task force, bold in the face of near certain doom, carried the day, driving Kurita away and saving most of the ships. The book read likes a great novel, I highly recommend it.	2004-06-28

An independent state for the first time with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine has been on the border of various empires for centuries, at various times being split between Russia and Poland (from the mid 1600s to the late 1700s), Russia and Austria (throughout the nineteenth century), and Russia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania (between the two world wars). The fact that Ukraine is literally a borderland has resulted in two main things she writes; a legacy of wars, purges, and other violence, and a \\"tenuous, equivocal sense of national identity.\\"<br /><br /> Reid takes the reader on a tour of Ukrainian history beginning with the medieval Kievan Rus kingdom, a civilization that gave rise to the later Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarussian peoples and languages (though it is still debated what the exact relationship between these groups are), civilizations that really started to widen in differences when the northern Rus fell under the sway of the Mongols and the southern Rus (the future Ukrainians) became dominated by the Lithuanians. From then on Ukraine's history was often a bloody one; between 1914 and 1921 1.5 million died thanks to World War I, the Russian Revolution and subsequent civil war (during which there were two Ukrainian independence movements, both failing); the deliberate and cruel Stalin-ordered famines of 1932-1933 killed a fifth of the entire rural population or a total of 5 million people; many thousands of Ukrainians - out of a total number in the Soviet Union of 1 million executed and 2 million dying in labor camps - perished in the 1937-1938 purges; and 5.3 million died in the Second World War, or one in six of the entire population. The Chernobyl incident, which is also explored, may yet still claim lives.<br /> Understandably lacking a national tradition (as for centuries there was no \\"Ukraine\\" nor were there \\"Ukrainians,\\" with at various times Poles and Russians refusing to respect Ukrainian culture, history, or language or even at times acknowledging its existence), they have struggled to find historical figures to identify with. One figure Reid discusses at length is the Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky (hetman being a title), a controversial figure who has been different things to different people (to the Ukrainians he was the leader of the first Ukrainian war of independence; to the Poles he was the rebel peasant who split Poland and started the nation on its long slow decline; to the Russians he has been the man who led the Ukrainians out of Polish domination and into the arms of Muscovy). Another she explores is Taras Shevchenko, a 19th century writer that many believe single-handedly turned Ukrainian into a literary language and went a very long way - perhaps more than any other figure - into creating a sense of national identity. Another figure - though not a specific individual - Reid explores as part of the Ukrainian national conscious is the Cossack, a figure she notes that is not unlike the cowboy in the American tradition; outlaw, frontiersmen, pioneer, fighter, even ranging across the steppe in covered wagons, drawing them up in a circle against Tatar (rather than Native American) attack.<br /> Reid tours the modern nation, showing more regionalism and variety than I knew existed in Ukraine. Far eastern Ukraine - the Donbass coal basin - is densely populated, heavily industrialized, and predominately Russian-speaking. The southern city of Odessa - on the shores of the Black Sea - is a largely unspoiled city of outdoor cafes, a city with a long multi-ethnic tradition that once attracted such persecuted minorities as Serbs, Greeks, Armenians, Mennonite Germans, and Bulgars. The far western city of Lviv is part of Galicia, a once Austrian-dominated region,home in the 19th and 20th centuries to most of Ukraine's dissidents, intelligentsia, and demonstrators. Chernivtsi, located in the shadow of the Carpathian Alps in extreme southwestern Ukraine, was ruled at various times by the Poles, Turks, Austrians, and Romanians, finally annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940, is now no longer as multi-ethnic as it once was but still a beautiful region of mountains and forests, once a favored vacation destination. She visited Crimea, a Russian-dominated peninsula that has had some difficulty believing it is part of Ukraine and a land that was once a pretty much independent Tatar state loosely associated with the Ottomans until annexed by Russia in 1783.<br /> So what does Reid believe the future hold for Ukraine? She thinks that the future is fairly bright for the country. While it had some serious problems going into independence, some of those very weaknesses were also strengths; the somewhat fuzzy sense of national identity (nowhere as near developed as it was in the Baltic states for instance) has worked in the country's favor in dealing with the large Russian minority. Given full citizenship upon independence, despite Ukrainian being made the official state language they were not required to take language tests to vote and the state even continued to fund Russian language schools. Reid also believed that the very bloodiness of Ukraine's history in the 20th century have lead many in the nation at a personal level to shy away from war and even politics.<br /> Where Ukraine might falter is largely in matters economic. The mid 1990s found Ukraine beset by runaway inflation and huge budget deficits, extreme difficulties in privatizing industries, and its agriculture so inefficient that 80% of all farmland produces only 50% of the total agricultural output. Perhaps worse, near epic corruption and red tape has several hampered business and foreign investment (she gives an example, where 14 different permits were required to export a sock).<br /> All in all though, the author feels hopeful about Ukraine's future.

US	52590451	R2M68L4N5PORA2	0375708081	992222068	The Dark Valley: A Panorama of the 1930s	Books	5	36	38	N	N	An epic book about a dark, dishonest decade	The 1930s was a \\"dark, dishonest decade,\\" a time when the nations of the earth were \\"struggling with one crisis and hurtling towards another,\\" one that turned out to be greatest in history.  A grim and gloomy time over much of the world, author Peirs Brendon has chronicled in _The Dark Valley_ that decade with amazing detail and an epic sweep. He wrote that the Great Depression - which was worldwide and hardly limited to the United States - was perhaps the greatest peacetime crisis to afflict the world since the Black Death. The old liberal order - which had barely survived the First World War and the Communist revolution in Russia - was nearly annihilated in the 1930s; the Depression ended the Weimar Republic and brought Hitler to power in Germany; fatally eroded the fragile pro-international parliamentary democracy in Japan, replacing it with a racist, expansionistic, militarist regime; brought Mussolini to power, who once in control sought to reap domestic rewards by means of foreign aggression; and completed the isolation of the Soviet Union, wracked by purges and Stalin-created famines. The strength and confidence of the democratic major powers were severely tested as well; Britain experienced a naval mutiny, hunger marches, and even some fascist demonstrations; France was torn by the worst civil conflict since the Commune; and the United States embarked on the most comprehensive and far-reaching peacetime program ever in its history, a nation where the Crash had caused people to be disillusioned with Wall Street and for business to lose its prestige. The democratic countries were divided when they should have been cooperating, guilty of erecting tariff barriers, rival devaluations of their currency, flagging (or in the case of the U.S., non-) participation in the League of Nations, and not presenting a united front to the fascist powers but instead one of appeasement and begrudging military expenditures. <br /> Again and again Brendon focuses on a single thread amidst the tapestry of events he wove, that much of the world was enveloped during that time in something akin to the fog of war. The 1930s was a time of \\"systematic obfuscation,\\" when governments fought for control of their own population and that of other nations by \\"manipulating minds and mobilizing opinion.\\" Propaganda and mass media were used to a degree unparalleled in previous history to obscure the truth.  Brendon provided many examples of this in his work. In the United Kingdom the BBC presented itself as being objective with regards to British labor disputes but was anything but; instead it presented the view of the authorities, the government approving many of the stories. Mussolini sought to grab the world's attention with daring aviation adventures (such as the crossing of the Atlantic several times by a squadron of Italian aircraft led by Italo Balbo), obscuring the truth that the Italian air force's development was neglected for the sake of these stunts, obsolete and ill-prepared for actual combat. Stalin sought to hide the Ukrainian famine, continuing to sell grain on the international market as if to deny there was any mass starvation in that region, erecting Potempkin villages of apparent plenty for the benefit of Western visitors, denying to outside relief agencies such as the Red Cross that millions had died due to his policies. Leni Riefensthal created masterpieces of Nazi propaganda with her elaborately staged parades and rallies involving elaborate sets, carefully controlled crowds of extras, platoons of cameramen, and novel film techniques like aerial photography, wide-angle shots, and telescopic lenses. Mussolini's agents ruthlessly censored reports of use of chemical weapons in the conquest of Ethiopia, declaring that victims of poison gas instead suffered from leprosy. The _New York Times_ instructed its reporter, sent to cover the French refugee camps that contained several hundred thousand Spanish exiles fleeing Franco's rule, from notfiling anything too \\"sentimental\\" about the often tortured and starved prisoners, while the French Minister of the Interior, Albert Sarraut, toured the camps and proclaimed them working in perfect order.  Hitler for the 1936 Berlin Olympics even had some hand-picked Jewish athletes in order to give a gloss over his fiercely anti-Semitic practices. The depressing list goes on. <br /> The book is thick, at around six hundred pages, covering the history of France, Italy, Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, the Soviet Union, and Spain.  Many events are covered, including the Dust Bowl, the Bonus March on Washington, the Night of the Long Knives, the Concorde riot, the bombing of Guernica, the rape of Nanking, the Anschluss, the Soviet show trials, Kristallnacht, the Lateran Pact, the New Deal, the Invergordon Mutiny, and the wretched gulags of the Soviet Union such as Vorkuta, Kargpool, Belomor, Pechora, Krasnodar, Karaganda, and those of the Kolyma network, which the author wrote should be etched in memory alongside Dachau and Auschwitz as places of pure hellish torture where people were literally worked to death. Though the decade may seem peaceful when compared to the 1940s, it was one filled with strife - the Japanese invasion of China, the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, and the Spanish Civil War - which is well covered in this work As grim as the subject matter is, there were still bits of humor in the book, interesting anecdotes, ranging from witty quotations of Churchill to discussion of Hollywood films of the time to other stories (such as that of the man employed to flush all the toilets every day in the Empire State Building so that chemicals in the water would not mar the porcelain finish, as when completed during the Depression the building had only 20% occupancy). The book was quite gripping for the most part though I did find my interest waning at times during discussion of some of the more esoteric aspects of British and French labor relations. A great read, one that will leave the reader begging to read something on World War II, as the book is a great prelude to any study of that conflict.	2004-06-19
US	52590451	R1I9HSAD4WZPX9	0425116840	469892992	The Cardinal of the Kremlin (Jack Ryan)	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Enjoyable classic Cold War spy thriller	I had been meaning to read \\"Cardinal of the Kremlin\\" now for several years. Published in 1988, it is one of the older Jack Ryan technothrillers, one that I had bypassed when I started reading Clancy's works, first \\"Red Storm Rising\\" and then beginning the Jack Ryan saga with \\"Clear and Present Danger.\\" I had - with the exception of \\"Without Remorse\\" and the newly published \\"Red Rabbit\\"- read all of the other subsequent books, and those books that I did not read I had seen the movie version (namely \\"The Hunt For Red October\\" and \\"Patriot Games\\"). I had resisted reading this one, or perhaps I should say I hadn't placed a high priority on this one, as they never filmed it, and it was a book very much steeped in Cold War intrigue, much of the novel taking place in the Soviet Union and involving two staples of the last years of the Cold War; \\"Star Wars\\" or the Strategic Defense Initiative (or to be more precise, something equivalent to it in the novel, a high-tech antiballistic missile or ABM system) and the Soviet war in Afghanistan. I was worried it would be antiquated, or that it would depict a Soviet Union that didn't really exist, as the collapse of the USSR in the late 1980s/early 1990s showed that how little the West really understood what the reality of the Soviet Union actually was.<br /> I decided to read the book recently, partially to say I had read all of the Jack Ryan novels, partially because I wanted to know more of Ryan's history (events in this novel were referenced several times in Clancy's later works), and partially because I had decided to treat it as a period piece (and I have in the past enjoyed good tales of Cold War intrigue). I figured it would show an interesting, early Ryan, quite a bit different from the powerful and experienced one who eventually becomes President of the United States later on in the \\"Ryanverse\\" series. <br /> I must say I enjoyed it. It wasn't my favorite of the Ryan series but it certainly held my interest and I found ita fast read. It was actually a rather enlightened novel, as it showed the Russians as real people; some were good, some were bad. The Soviets depicted were for the most part fairly well rounded individuals, who just like Americans simply wanted more or less the same thing out of life; basically success and happiness. Some were not good people but even they weren't depicted as moustache-twirling, cackling Cold War villains, though to be sure there were bad guys in the piece. While it is not surprising that the title character of the book - the Cardinal, Colonel Mikhail Filitov, a highly placed spy in the Soviet military - is shown as a good person, it was somewhat surprising that many of those opposed to his actions were not shown as evil or vile but simply as often good people doing their job. In essence, Clancy showed that while the Soviet regime was bad, its people weren't necessarily so. His view of governments versus people - particularly with regards to the Russians - holds true in his later works as well, showing a good deal of consistency in his writing. Perhaps I didn't give Clancy enough credit in this regard, I don't know. In any event I found myself occasionally rooting for characters in the novel who were actually opposed to Filitov, Ryan, and the other protagonists. <br /> The novel itself was as some have said more of a straightforward spy novel than some of the other volumes in the Jack Ryan series, with many classic espionage scenes taking place in Moscow and involving the KGB. Five major plotlines are followed in the novel, with four of these plotlines tightly interwoven; the Soviet Union is pursuing a largely ground-based ABM system (Bright Star), the United States is also pursuing one named Tea Clipper  (these plots also involved those in one program trying to spy on the other nation's efforts), Colonel Filitov is spying for the Americans (and related to that plotline, there are Russians trying to uncover him), and Jack Ryan and others in the American government are conducting arms reduction negotiations in Moscow (ultimately the latter storyline becomes subservient to the others) The fifth plotline revolves around an Afghan mudjaheddin named the \\"Archer\\" and his actions in Afghanistan against Soviet forces and doesn't tie in hardly at all at first though it does in the end (more or less I think). <br /> Action-wise the book was middle of the road (if anything fairly light) until the end when several plotlines end in some violence (particularly the Archer plot). The storyline with Filitov ended with some surprise for me, though it was an ending hinted at in the later Ryan books I had read. <br /> I am glad I read the book and have an appetite for more, both from Clancy and from another similar author who I have really grown to respect, James W. Huston (I highly recommend his works). Often overlooked by Clancy fans - it certainly was by me - I think it is a shame more haven't read it.	2004-06-07

It is nation where people have seven weeks of paid vacation a year, generally take an hour and a half for lunch, have one of the longest life expectancies on the planet, work in the fourth largest economy in the world, and have one of the finest health care systems in the world. It is also a nation that has one of the lowest rates of charitable donations in the developed world, where people expect the State to do everything because they pay so much in taxes, where the civil service makes up about a quarter of the working population, and where local initiative or self-rule is virtually non-existent. What explains these many paradoxes? <br /> Authors Jean-Benoit Nadeau and Julie Barlow sought to discover the source of these contrasts and to learn why the French were so different. Living for three years in France, they worked almost as ethnologists, delving into all aspects of French political, cultural, and economic life, uncovering many things from an outsider's perspective. Writing about the French civil service, economy, media, education, charities, unions, social welfare system, courts, politics, foreign policy, history, and language, they provide a thorough and very readable primer on all things French. <br /> One thing they point out is that the French as a people love power. They have a great disdain for compromise - both in politics and even in personal conversations - instead preferring winners and losers, embracing particularly in politics what the authors termed \\"jusqu'au-boustisme\\" (until-the-bitter-end-ism), of the tendency in politics to pursue winning even to destructive ends. An ultimate expression of this might be found in the fact that State is absolute in French politics and society; it tolerates no rivals, whether it was the Catholic clergy's onetime dominance over the nation's education system or the existence of any meaningful regional government tied to a local culture, though the latter has changed some in recent years. The French love for their politicians to exhibit grandeur (and the politicians love to exhibit it), practicing something called cumul des mandates (or simply the cumul); it is possible for one to hold more than one elected office at the same time (for instance for a time President Jacques Chirac was also mayor of Paris, the prime minister, deputy from his home region of Correze, and a deputy in the European Parliament). Indeed the French President is one of the most powerful heads of state in the democratic world, in many ways more powerful that the American President. <br /> Some of this lover of grandeur is exhibited in the fact that the French state is very much a unitary one, not a federal one; the central government in Paris reigns supreme, even in matters in the U.S. that would be regarded as strictly local affairs, such as the choosing of school textbooks or in most cases the management of local police. For instance the mayor of Paris does not control local police or transport, but they are instead controlled by the central government. Only towns of less than ten thousand citizens are allowed to control their own police.<br /> This tendency to have a highly centralized, almost absolutist democracy though is not entirely due to a French love of grandeur. Much of dates back to the centuries long attempts to create the nation of France and keep it together, to impose French culture and language on more distant regions. At the time of the Revolution, the doctrine of the Republique was that \\"nothing should come between the citizen and the State.\\" The French State actually created what we today call France, assimilating very diverse populations, giving them a single nationality, eradicating any local power or local language, acting for decades with extreme suspicion of anything (including churches) that fostered any sense of local community beyond the instruments of the state. Though France has levels of local administration - the Commune, the Department, and the Region - these do not exactly correspond to Canadian provinces or American states in that they have no sovereign rights themselves or exhibit any significant sense of French separation of powers, but instead are for the most part representatives of the central government. In the case of the 99 Departments, they were created as a result of the Revolution, often designed to deliberately break up regional identities, dividing lands with local identities into more than one Department, often given non-historical, sometimes deliberately meaningless names. The advent of the Region in 1982 reversed this to an extent, as Regions reflect natural cultural divisions in France, such as the areas inhabited by the Bretons, Occitan, or Corsicans, though some in France fear that this may lead to federalism one day (while at the same time France has given increasing powers to the supranational European Union). <br /> This is not to say that the French State is anti-democratic; it was founded with three principles, assimilation (or eradication des particularismes; eradication of local differences), interet general (or common good), and equality (not only equality of opportunity but also equal or identical law throughout France). The principle of assimilation had been a driving force in creating the Departments (though ironically has made integration of the growing Muslim community in France difficult as it has until recently been regarded as illegal to even recognize special status or differences among French citizens). <br />  There are checks on the Republique. In addition to civil and criminal law, the French have administrative law, an entirely parallel legal system for dealing with matters relating how the State relates to the citizens, administrative tribunals that can rule against government and the state. The growing independence of judges is another check. Protests are a way of life in France, a legitimate method for citizens to curb the system, the authors detailing this uniquely French form of political expression at some length. <br /> I have barely scratched the surface in my review of this fascinating book. It is an absolute must read for anyone wanting to do business or live in France.	2004-05-17

Kaplan noted that some experts focused on the effects of overpopulation and environmental degradation as the dominant forces (particularly in the developing world), while others spoke of a \\"new anarchy\\" (such as former UN secretary-general Perez de Cuellar, he and others noting that of the eighty wars between 1945 and 1995, forty-six were either civil wars or guerilla insurgencies). In 1993, forty-two countries were involved in major conflicts and thirty-seven others were suffering some lesser form of political violence (sixty-five of these seventy-nine nations were in the developing world). Kaplan journeyed through sub-Saharan West Africa from Guinea to Togo and through Egypt, Turkey, Iran, former Soviet Central Asia, Pakistan, India, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia in his research for the book.  <br /> He found a predictably bleak situation in Africa. While 13 percent of the human race lives in Africa, they contribute only 1.2 percent of the world's gross domestic product. Crime - particularly violent crime - is soaring in much of Africa; for a time the United States suspended direct flights from the U.S. to Lagos, Nigeria due to the rampant violent crime at the terminal and nearby, the first time any such embargo had occurred for non-political and non-terrorist reasons. Soaring malaria in Africa is intensifying the spread of AIDS (as malaria can result in anemia, which requires blood transfusions), just as AIDS and tuberculosis are helping each other's spread. <br /> As bad as the economy, crime, and disease in Africa are though, Kaplan believes the real problem in sub-Saharan Africa is too-rapid urbanization, a problem he comes to again and again in the book.  Festering \\"bush-slums\\" that appear on few maps border many African cities, where relatively prosperous cities end up being \\"slum-magnets for an emptying countryside.\\" He visited several such slums in Ivory Coast and elsewhere in West Africa, many packed with migrants from Mali, Niger, and elsewhere (50% of the population of the Ivory Coast is now non-Ivorian). The native forest culture of Africa, however primitive, was being destroyed by soaring birthrates, alcohol, cheap guns, and extremely dense concentrations of humanity in slums that lacked any stabilizing and unifying government or culture. Though he does not believe this to be the only factor in the bloody conflicts in Liberia and elsewhere, he does believe it to be a dominant one.<br /> Though not leading to the level of social breakdown as seen in Africa, rapidly growing cities - packed with peasants drawn in from the countryside - was a dominant feature in other nations he found as well. China, while touted at the time of writing as having a 14 per cent growth rate, really meant that coastal China was growing; this growth did not apply to inland China (and also could be said to favor the cities and not the countryside), leading to a mass migration from the countryside. Migration to shantytowns in Pakistan is tremendous, owing in large part to a skyrocketing population rate (only 9 percent of Pakistani women use contraceptives and the population of Pakistan is close to doubling every twenty years), a situation leading to empty villages and a poorly urbanized peasantry that cities are unable to cope with. <br /> Kaplan found similar problems in Egypt, where urban poverty and newly urbanized peasants, threatened with the loss of traditions, the government unable to help them, with basic services like water and electricity breaking down, having found something to turn to; Islam. Islam is thriving in a time of unregulated urbanization and internal and external refugee migrations. With increasingly militant Islamic Egyptians turning against Christian Arabs (both Coptic Christians, who like the Lebanese Kaplan met in West Africa and the Korean grocers of South Los Angeles, formed a \\"middlemen minority\\" in Egypt, as well as the Christian leaders like UN secretary-general Boutros-Ghali who failed to aid Bosnian Muslims) and turning to the Ikhwan el Muslimin (Muslim Brotherhood) for social services instead of an increasingly overburdened state, Kaplan sees scarcity and woes of the urbanized peasantry of the shantytowns as the driving force in many ways in Egypt. <br />The growing marriage of Islam and urbanized peasantry was not unique to Egypt. To a somewhat lesser extent Kaplan found a similar process on-going in Turkey, as the Turkish migrants to the gecekondus (literally \\"built in the night;\\" shanty-town houses) on the fringes of Istanbul found more aid from the Islamic Welfare Party in the form of water, coal, and food than from the Turkish government itself. In some areas of western China such as Kashgar, overcrowding, unemployment, and the lack of any real middle class was leading to a Muslim resurgence there among non-ethnic Chinese. <br /> So what did Kaplan learn from his travels? He was quite frustrated, and found that the more he traveled the less he felt he knew. Kaplan did grow disgusted with the idea of political \\"science,\\" paraphrasing Tolstoy in _Anna Karenina_ in writing that while successful cultures are in many ways alike, unsuccessful ones fail each in their own way.  He did come to the conclusion that nation-states at least in West Africa, the Near East, and Central Asia were weakening. In some cases organizations and entities outside or beyond the state - such as the various Islamic groups in Egypt and Turkey - were starting to fill in the vacuum, while in other, failed states such as Sierra Leone, nothing was taking its place. Borders in some regions, the legacy of long-gone European imperial powers, were becoming less and less important. Laos and Cambodia were in some sense creations of the French, areas that might have long been swallowed by the Chinese, Vietnamese, andThai and were now being divided up economically if not politically by these countries. I think his firmest conclusion though was that poorly and newly urbanized rural poor flocking to the cities represented the greatest challenge.	2004-05-12
US	52590451	R1330YKZHOMBNI	0375708359	329777968	An Area of Darkness: A Discovery of India	Books	5	10	13	N	N	An unflinching, well written look at India	This book details the experiences of author V.S. Naipaul in India between February 1962 and February 1964, of his travails there with the locals, his discoveries about the people of India, and his coming to terms of what is India and what it means to be Indian. I found him an excellent writer, many of his personal stories reading like fiction, and have since found that Naipaul has a loyal following of readers. I may indeed try to find more of his works in the future.<br /> Naipaul is of Indian heritage, but was not born there but rather on the Caribbean island of Trinidad. Some of the first part of the book detailed his growing up there, of his internal resolution as a child between his Indian household and the often very non-Indian islanders, a very diverse group that included a great many of African descent. Much of the rest of the book at least to me seemed to be the author trying to learn more about the country he ultimately hailed from, about what India is really like.<br /> Naipaul provided several stories and anecdotes about his time in India. He opened the book with a little exploration of the often Byzantine if not Sisyphean paperwork and bureaucracy of India, describing his trials and tribulations of simply trying to import a bit of alcohol to the dry port of Bombay. A lengthy section details his time spent on a hotel on a lake in Kashmir, of his involvement in the day to day lives of those who lived in and ran the hotel, even accompanying them on a pilgrimage to a Hindu shrine in the Himalayas. Another story relates his time he was befriended by a Sikh while traveling by train in southern India, a friendship that was apparently founded in misunderstanding and did not end well.<br /> The main point of the book though was a rather unflinching and unromantic look at India, or at least India in the early 1960s. He shows the India a traveler, an outsider, would actually see, an India that many Indians he writes simply do not see or refuse to see. <br /> Castehe finds still dominates life in India, serving to imprison \\"a man in his function,\\" rendering \\"millions faceless.\\" A businessman's function is to make money by whatever means he can; he does not have a duty though to produce good quality items. It is not an issue of dishonesty or of short-sightedness, as service is not an Indian concept. He described groups of sweepers who cleaned a set of stairs; after they worked with twig brooms, rags, and buckets of dirty water, the stairs and wall are not only not cleaner but dirtier than ever. However they fulfilled their function, which was to sweep, or rather to be sweepers. Actual cleanliness was not the issue. Indians have been known to be picnicking on the banks of a river while someone drowned, not lifting a finger to help. He writes that the Indians do not lack courage or an admiration for it, but rather see courage and the choice to risk one's life to save another the function only of soldiers. Attempts to save government jobs for untouchables is not lauded, as this merely in many Indian's eyes simply puts responsibility into the hands of those unqualified - by their caste - to perform that function.  Those who buck the caste system, or are outside of it, such those Indians who were born overseas, are not accepted by the system and often frustrated. <br />  Naipaul wrote of the many squatters he saw in India (which I am certain didn't win him many friends with those who would promote Indian tourism); Indians he writes, \\"defecate everywhere.\\" He saw people squatting and defecating beside railway tracks, along river banks, on the streets, never looking for cover, rarely with any sense of embarrassment. Even when presented with public lavatories were as likely to use the floor as anything else. Indians he says do not see these squatters, and certainly do not see the problem. Interests in sanitation are the concern of latrine-cleaners - not the concerns of the other castes - and to clean up after oneself would be unseemly, that unnecessary labor outside the required actions of one's caste was degrading. <br /> Though obviously not something Naipaul saw personally he did spend time discussing Gandhi, relating to it the issues of public sanitation and caste. Gandhi, having spent twenty years in South Africa, saw India through an outsider's eyes. He saw sanitation linked to caste and that caste was linked to a disregard for others as well as inefficiency and a needlessly and hopelessly divided country, all of which lead to weakness and the rule of India by foreigners. Gandhi tried repeatedly to attack the psychology of caste, to show that there was dignity and a need for cleaning the excrement and filth of the nation. Naipaul believed that this was Gandhi's most important work, not his message of non-violent resistance of the British, work that he ultimately failed in, as his efforts were eventually reduced to mere symbolism, that latrine cleaning became among many simply an occasional, virtuous, highly symbolic action rather than an effort to really improve things. <br /> I found his thoughts on the numerous ruins of India quite interesting. They are not revered as they might be in Europe, as respect for the past is a European, not an Indian, tradition. Not only are ruins everywhere and considered commonplace, but they do not speak of any development of the country's spirit and definition of nationalism or are revered as such. Rather - as with Mogul architecture - instead they tell of \\"personal plunder\\" and a nation with \\"an infinite capacity for being plundered.\\" They are wasteful and without function; though the Taj Mahal is lovely, it is a despot's monument to one woman, nothing more. <br /> An interesting book, I would like to know how the author's thoughts on India changed in his later writings, if they did.	2004-03-31

He details much of what he saw of the rise and fall of Yeltsin and the advent of Putin and the events of their rule, including the privatization of many Soviet industries (\\"an industrial fire sale\\" of epic proportions), the conflict in Chechnya (the worst fighting in Russia since Stalingrad), and the decline in social and economic well-being of many Russians.<br /> Meier spends a good-sized portion of the book on the subject of Moscow, with its \\"wretched masses and gluttonous elite,\\" a city that remains the heart of Russia, home of over ten million people, one that grew famous after the collapse of the Soviet Union for its boisterous night clubs and its nearly uncontrolled free market. At least some of the city's character derives from Mayor Yuri Luzkhov, who perhaps has influenced the city in its post-Soviet decade more than any other. Adored by Muscovites - who reelected him in 1996 with 90% of the vote - he has become noted for restoring many of the city's pre-Soviet symbols, such as rebuilding the Resurrection Gate to Red Square.<br /><br />Much of Moscow and indeed Russian politics has been dominated by the self-styled oligarchs, the new millionaires and billionaires such as Boris Berezovsky, Vladimir Gusinsky, and Vladimir Potanin who arose during the \\"Great Gab\\" of the Yeltsin years, grabbing a share of the division of post-Soviet spoils and often growing preposterously rich. Their story is not all rosy however, as many have links to organized crime, and they and Russians everywhere were hit hard by the August 1998 stock market crash and a number of scandals which came to public attention such as the Mabetex scandal and the Bank of New York affair, some involving the highest levels of government.<br /> In contrast to the oligarchs, Meier showed that many Russians were not as well off. Some longed for the days of the Soviet Union, when they felt things were better. A third of households lie below the poverty line, and HIV and drug addiction are a growing epidemic in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and elsewhere. Crime he writes is particularly rampant in St. Petersburg, where assassinations of rival politicians and industrialists are not unknown.<br /> The most interesting section was the one on Chechnya. Located a thousand miles south of Moscow between the Black and Caspian Seas, this Connecticut-sized area of 6,000 square miles is one of the so-called small nations that lie within Russia's borders, once romanticized by Pushkin, Tolstoy, and Mikhail Lermontov in military epics starring \\"swarthy mountaineers with bejeweled daggers and mysterious black-eyed\\" women. He chronicled the war in Chechnya - really two wars - the first war began on New Year's Eve 1994 and ended on August 6, 1996, launched to quell a nationalist uprising and in which as many as 100,000 died. The peace that followed brought little more than poverty, banditry, a kidnapping trade, and some local attempts to impose Shari'a law. War with Moscow became inevitable again though when in 1999 two of the most famous fighters of the war - Shamil Basayev and the Saudi mercenary Khattab a.k.a The Black Arab - launched raids into the mostly Muslim neighboring republic of Dagestan (firmly within Russian borders) and a series of massive bombings in August and September of that year killed nearly 300 people in Moscow and elsewhere. Though there were some doubts about a Chechen link to the bombings, the nation united behind what is sometimes called Putin's War, as over a hundred thousand Russian soldiers descended upon Chechnya in September of 1999.<br /> At great risk to himself - unescorted and unapproved journalists in Chechnya were forbidden and kidnapping is a common local occupation - Meier toured Chechnya. Meier wrote of the zachistka, Russian for a \\"little cleanup\\" or a mopping up operation, a routine of the operations during Putin's War, which generally meant a house-to-house search for members of the Chechen opposition, though some have compared them to Stalin's purges, the chiski. Sometimes these operations resulted in civilian deaths, such as occurred in the village of Aldy on February 5, 2000, recognized (eventually) by even the Russian government as a war crime, when civilians were slaughtered and people were summarily executed.<br /> The author saw some of Siberia, flying to the city of Krasnoyarsk and boarding a steamer, sailing 1300 miles up the Yenisei, Russia's second largest river, to the mining town of Norilsk, north of the Arctic Circle. Built of the Gulag he writes, it was the stereotypical Soviet industrial city built over the bones of prisoners used as slave labor, a city ordered by Stalin to exist in one of the world's harshest climates, founded to exploit a vast mineral wealth. Though still producing most of Russia's nickel, platinum, copper, and palladium, the need for workers had decreased in the city. Sadly though many of those who live there - descendents of the original zeks or prisoners (if not former zeks themselves) - have become institutionalized, having no where else in Russia to go to.<br /> Meier also visited Vladivostok and the surrounding region and the island of Sakhalin, the subject of much of Chekhov's writings, which well before the Soviets and Stalin was a distant destination for prisoners, as well as. A rugged region often quite isolated from Moscow, long a haven from Tsarist rule and a last holdout for White partisans during the Civil War, here the locals have long been used to self-reliance. Although the region - particularly Sakhalin - is rich in timber, fur, salmon, and offshore petroleum, development (at least to the benefit of the locals) has been stymied by what some refer to as the three Russian diseases; greed, corruption, and bureaucracy. Attempts at foreign investment in the area have been complicated if not thwarted by organized crime and corrupt politicians.<br /> This 450 page book is too massive to adequately summarize here; excellent coverage of Russia since the Fall, with copious end notes and an exhaustive bibliography.se-to-house search for members of the Chechen opposition, though some have compared them to Stalin's purges, the chiski.

US	52590451	R6EMWTUW32XLL	0452284139	49722860	Dangerous Waters: Modern Piracy and Terror on the High Seas	Books	5	37	40	N	N	Compelling look at the all-too-real threat of modern piracy	_Dangerous Waters_ is an excellent book by John S. Burnett, a revelatory work that showed me a whole new world I had little idea existed, the world of modern pirates. Pirates are unfortunately thought of as dashing romantic figures of the earlier centuries, perhaps a threat during the age of sail or suitable for a Hollywood movie, but not a threat today. Burnett contradicts this stereotype, showing that pirates are alive and well in the 21st century, a threat to everything from the lives of sailors at sea to quite possibly international security, with 335 assaults worldwide and 241 seafarers killed, held hostage, or wounded in 2001. Indeed attacks are up 400 percent since 1992, with over 2000 sailors having been taken hostage in the ten years from 1992-2002. <br />The pirates today are a mixed bunch and can be found all over the world and can be anyone from  a highly trained guerilla warrior to a rogue military unit (such as in Indonesia) to part of an international criminal gang or cartel. Pirates might also be part of international terrorist organizations (particularly Abu Sayaf out of the Philippines, which has strong links to Al-Qaeda as well as Asian crime syndicates and the heroin trade) or even simply local down-and-out fishermen who see a rich prize steaming by and can't resist (he states that poverty has driven many to piracy in the Caribbean, in Nigeria, Bangladesh, and elsewhere). Burnett writes that pirate weapons can vary from knives and machetes to modern assault rifles and grenade launchers. Pirates have even been known to have an insider in the crew of a ship, planted there to assist in a plan act of piracy.  <br />The reader will discover that pirates can attack any ship - ranging from small private yachts to the largest of the supertankers - in any locale, including port or on open, international waters. The goal of the pirates can vary from robbing the ship's safe and the sailors of their personal possessions (such as money and jewelry) to the ship's cargo (be it millions of dollars in petroleum or on a private yacht the expensive electronics) to the ship and the sailors themselves, the former turned into a phantom ship that is used to smuggle weapons, drugs, or illegal immigrants, the latter fodder for a thriving international kidnapping trade (that is if the crew are not simply killed and dumped overboard). <br />Pirates can be found anywhere in the world though the main areas that they seem to operate in are west from Indonesian waters to as far east as Taiwan and the Philippines (favoring the vital shipping lanes through the Malacca Straits and the dangerous waters of the South China Sea), as well as off the coast of Brazil, off the Somali coast of East Africa, and West Africa. The Malacca Straits in particular are a vital area plagued at times by pirates; as $500 billion in goods passes through it annually, sometimes as many as 600 ships a day going through the Straits, which in some places are less than a mile wide, it is a target rich environment for pirates but one that is not particularly well policed.  Though some waters where pirates operate are regularly patrolled - the Royal Malaysian Marine Police and the Singapore marine police are very active against pirates - other countries are unable or unwilling to work against them, with in Indonesia some military units either working with the pirates or pirates themselves. His description of the South China Sea - bordered by Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, the Philippines, China, and Taiwan - was particularly chilling, an area where international laws and standards aren't particularly well-enforced;  which he writes is an \\"unpatrolled black hole where unarmed vessels and their civilian crews simply fall off the edge of the planet,\\" an area where Abu Sayaf rebels have been know to attack ships with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades and kidnap rich tourists off of resort islands. <br /> Burnett found that the odds are stacked in thepirate's favor. Ship crews are smaller than they used to be; in the 1950s a crew of 40 to 45 might manage a tanker carrying 6.3 million gallons of oil; now it is not unusual to find a few as 17 (such as on the _Montrose_, a ship Burnett traveled on) transporting 84 million gallons of oil. With the exception of Russian and Israeli ships, merchant ships very rarely carry weapons (something generally not encouraged on a supertanker anyway), having to rely instead on other anti-piracy devices, such as carpet tacks spread on decks, fire hoses, deck patrols, dummies set at the railings at night, brilliant deck lights, and new satellite tracking devices that can help the International Maritime Bureau and local navies locate hijacked ships (such as ShipLoc). Burnett has shown though that it is nearly impossible to keep off a ship determined pirates, and it is best for a crew to not try and resist (as in many cases pirates do not kidnap or kill). Some shipping companies that have the resources have employed more high-tech and expensive measures, such as wiring decks to administer lethal electric charges, closed-circuit TV cameras to detect someone slipping aboard a ship, and particularly in the case of cruise ships armed mercenaries (some cruise lines are known to use Nepalese Gurkhas). Though the U.S. and British navies don't appear to operate much against pirates, they do appear to take the threat seriously at least in some circumstances; the ships that are used to transport plutonium from Europe to Japan are constantly monitored by spy satellites, often escorted by a surface warship, and always shadowed by at least one British or U.S. nuclear sub. <br /> Burnett laments the fact that pirates are not taken seriously as a growing threat in today's world, not by many of the world's navies, not in some cases by shipping companies, and rarely by the general public (particularly in the United States).	2004-03-22

Into his office comes a stranger by the name of Griffin, bearing with him an intriguing proposal; he is to set aside his duties at what essentially is his dream job (or so he thought) and work for him on a top secret project, a project Griffin cannot reveal any information at the time about and any information Leyster uncovers working for them cannot be published. Leyster at first of course refuses. Griffin leaves Leyster's office, having placed an Igloo cooler on his desk. After Griffin left, Leyster opens it and is astounded by what he finds; the head of a very freshly killed stegosaur. After verifying that it was real Leyster does make contact again with Griffin and agrees to work on his project. <br /> The project is indeed a most impressive one, with Griffin apparently the chief administrator for am ambitious effort to study the Mesozoic from the earliest Triassic to the end of the Cretaceous, shortly before whatever event ended the reign of the dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and the various prehistoric marine reptile species. The organization manages a number of stations throughout the Mesozoic and undertakes extensive studies of the fauna of the era, uncovering a wealth of information and many new species.<br /> Unfortunately a lot of mystery surrounds both time travel and the organization that Leyster is now working for. Both the origin of time travel and the very nature of how it works are closely guarded secrets. Leyster cannot openly publish his research, andindeed the very existence of time travel and that people have seen living dinosaurs must remain a secret from the public (though we find later that in the future it does become public knowledge and Leyster and others are free to publish their findings at that point). <br /> Even more mysteriously there are many rules and regulations regarding time travel. Much effort is made to prevent paradoxes from forming, as apparently one can change the past to a degree, causing immense problems in the future. Griffin and his associates work hard to prevent such paradoxes from forming, a difficult task considering that researchers are recruited from the future to work on the project, working alongside with what are to them often legends, aware of books that the people of Leyster's time haven't even written yet. Sometimes there are teams where some of the researches weren't even born yet in the current time frame of the oldest members of a particular team, having come from that far into the future. There are even occasions when future versions of present day people meet and even work together, though Griffin and his subordinates keep a very tight rein on this. <br /> There are a number of other interesting characters in the book, including notably Dr. Getrude Salley, a rather complicated individual that who while clearly loving paleontology also has a regrettable history of doing some reprehensible things to advance her research and get into the limelight. Leyster and her we find have a very complex history together, one that stretches through time and space. There is also the Old Man, an enigmatic character (whose identity is revealed later in the book), a strange, shadowy man who knows everything about the project and has ultimate authority, coming and going on whims and on projects that no one, not even Griffin, understands. <br /> A lot happens in the book. I think the best section was when an expedition led by Leyster becomes stranded in the late Cretaceous, with Leyster and his team of graduate students having to survive in the hostile wilderness. Even while fighting for their lives and struggling to come up with some of the most basic necessities of life they still remain scientists at heart and make some amazing discoveries. <br /> The end of the book and the ultimate origin of time travel I found to be quite surprising, though I am not sure I entirely liked it; I am still digesting it. <br /> Although I am no scientist, I am an enthusiastic amateur and I found for the most part the science in the book was pretty good. He posits the existence of several species that we do not know from the fossil record, including a basal spinosaur that was popularly called a \\"fisher\\" (and subject to nest parasitism by an allosaur, an interesting though unsupported theory), _Geistosaurus_ (a mute hadrosaur, hadrosaurs being the famous \\"duck-billed\\" dinosaurs that are now believed by many to have been quite vocal animals), and several interesting late Cretaceous forms such as the marsh hopper (a small, vaguely raccoon-like animal that lived along river banks) and tree-divers (hand-sized crocodile relatives that had membranes that stretched between their limbs, enabling them to glide). Also included were a few I thought he did make up at first until I researched them, such as _Stygivenator_ (a highly derived late Cretaceous tyrannosaurid species, smaller than most tyrannosaurs). One problem I had though was with Swanwick depicting some dinosaurs that were not feathered as adults possessing young covered in down (such as the allosaur in the story). By my understanding of such things this is not possible, as the type of body covering a species has as a juvenile will be the same it has as an adult, and that while there were feathered dinosaurs there were no dinosaurs that were feathered while young and not feathered when mature. <br /> An interesting book, I recommend it.	2004-02-18

Very early on in the novel we find that Spock has been hard at work on Romulus, a tumultuous and chaotic place following the events portrayed in \\"Nemesis,\\" with considerable doubt as to who will ultimately be in charge of the Romulan Empire, the loyalty of the military, whether or not a civil war might erupt in the Empire, and how this will affect the Alpha and Beta Quadrants. Though able now to work openly owing to a détente of sorts with the Federation, Spock still faces considerable opposition; in fact so much opposition he is killed early on the book (this is no secret, as the book jacket reveals this information).<br /> The Federation convinces Kirk to go to Romulus to lead a group to investigate Spock's death, traveling in a semi-official capacity on a non-Starfleet vessel (or at least one that does not appear as such, as in reality it is basically a spy ship). Traveling to Romulus with Picard, Beverly Crusher, Scotty, McCoy, and his son, the group quickly becomes embroiled in intrigue and subterfuge mainly on the planet Remus, rather than on the original destination on Romulus. They find that the situation is even more chaotic than previously thought, war is closer than they feared, and that one of their number stands to be quite involved in events in the Empire. They make some surprising discoveries and while some events are resolved it is clear that much remains unresolved and there will be a follow-up book to this one as the Federation - indeed perhaps the entire galaxy - is facing a dire menace that they are woefully unprepared to handle.<br /> That's the summary of what the book is about, roughly, but what did I think of it? It was ok, not great but not bad. I thought it had a good set-up and I am very interested in what is going to happen next in the storyline. It is quite possible that the next book in the series is going to be quite engaging; certainly a lot can be lost in the next one, so grave is the danger faced. The actual story itself was sometimes so-so; the intrigue and politics on Romulus and even more so on Remus got confusing and sometimes tedious, with our heroes splitting up again and again and then conveniently meeting up again and again. Sometimes it seemed a tad unbelievable and even contrived at times howtheir various paths crossed again and again. Maybe it was the way I read the story but sometimes the Romulus-Remus-civil war- Spock's assassination plotline felt a bit rushed, as if the main plot that the authors were interested in was the one first developed in \\"Captains' Peril\\" and one that will clearly be the focus of the next book in the series (or I would be very much surprised if it was not). I liked how it tried to expand upon events portrayed in \\"Nemesis,\\" as I believe that if there were on-going Star Trek series set in its \\"present\\" that fallout from that would be a major focus of stories, but I don't know if it was as quite as effective as it should have been. I think they gave Spock's involvement in these events rather short shrift and it seemed almost as if in the end his efforts were all for naught, I don't know. Though overall in this series - as one reviewer described, the \\"Shatnerverse\\" - there has been considerable attempt to be consistent with not only of course the other novels of the series but also the various movies and television series this do not mean that they always handle those references well. I also felt that some of the characters - notably Crusher and Scotty - weren't given a whole heck of a lot to do. <br /> Still, not a bad book and if you like the series I would say go and read it. Certainly it would be essential read before getting the next in the series, whenever it is published.	2004-02-14
US	52590451	R1M8RVM3P487D0	0671021281	470106474	Captain's Peril (Star Trek)	Books	4	15	17	N	N	Good installment in the Shatner Star Trek series	\\"Captain's Peril\\" is seventh is the excellent Star Trek novel series by William Shatner and Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, a series that began with \\"Ashes of Eden\\" and centers - at least in part - around the premise that Kirk did not meet his final end as portrayed in the movie \\"Star Trek: Generations,\\" but rather he was resurrected, events surrounding this of which are detailed in the second novel in the series, \\"The Return.\\" This novel, as are all the others with the exception of the bulk of \\"Ashes of Eden\\" takes place contemporaneously with the events of the Star Trek universe at large, with each successive novel in the series incorporating events portrayed in the various television series and movies (several throwaway lines in this novel hint at events depicted in the currently on-going series \\"Enterprise\\" with references to Archer and T'Pol). <br /> Having said that though, it is not necessary for one to have read the preceding novels in this series, though they may shed some light on a few brief references to what has gone before. In previous novels of the series James T. Kirk, Jean-Luc Picard, and others have dealt with issues ranging from conspiracies within Starfleet to the Borg to villains from the alternate universe first depicted The Original Series episode \\"Mirror, Mirror.\\" This one starts off with (aside from a prologue set during the Cardassian occupation of Bajor) with Picard and Kirk taking a vacation to Bajor. The two friends sought to combine their mutual interests, the vacation starting out with some orbital skydiving, which would take the pair to a Bajoran archaeological dig along the shores of an inland sea in the desert, the researchers there investigating a sunken ancient city, one that was covered by waters released thanks to Cardassian efforts (depicted in the prologue). <br /> The vacation does not go off as planned; first they almost die during the orbital skydiving thanks to faulty equipment, leaving them miles away from their landing zone next to the dig and without hope to be rescued before possibly dying of thirst or exposure. To pass the time Kirk describes to Picard events he faced very early as captain of the Enterprise, less than six months into its first five year mission. This story is told throughout the course of the novel and I found it quite engaging, showing how Kirk and Spock became friends, how Kirk grew into the role of captain, and what the Enterprise was like in the transitional period between Pike and Kirk having command of the ship. The story tied into a surprising degree with events in the story and was capped at the end of the book by a riveting and chilling epilogue, one which begs to be followed up by the authors in future works. <br /> Kirk and Picard are rescued by one of the archaeologists, but they find that he wasn't out looking for them; he was out seeking a murderer! One of the foremost scientists at the camp had been murdered and no one there knows who did it or why. Much of the novel details Picard's and Kirk's efforts to solve this crime and bring the murderer to justice. The camp is completely cut off from the outside world, with no communications, miles from nowhere in the desert wilderness, Kirk and Picard lacking any weapons or access to sophisticated technology, many in the camp openly hostile to their presence, several with ample motive and opportunity to have committed the murder; the two captains have their work cut out for them. <br /> I found the murder investigation a bit less riveting than Kirk's tale of his early days as captain. While by no means bad - it was interesting in that it had a lot to do with Bajoran history and particularly Bajoran religion - I found it at times confusing. Matters weren't helped much by the fact I had trouble sometimes keeping track of the various archaeologists and others at the camp. This is not to say that they were all alike, as some were quite distinct, but enough were similar and there names sort of ended up blending together for me. I still liked it, just didn't find it as effective as the second plot line, the one set in the past.<br /> A good book, it didn't have quite the epic scope as earlier books in this series and I sort of liked that (though the plotline relayed through Kirk's tale has much broader implications in the future if the authors chose to explore it). All in all though a very good read, one I would recommend (though there were other books in the series that were better); certainly I would read it if you liked others in this series.	2004-02-10
US	52590451	R3MEWTZDWB5OEB	0865474974	376858590	Giant Bluefin	Books	5	6	6	N	N	riveting book about tuna and the harpoon fishery	I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found it surprisingly engrossing. It introduced me to a whole other world, the world of commercial fishing, one I knew little about, a world filled with rivalries, friendships, a long history, a world I think most Americans don't appreciate. Though focusing primarily on the harpoon fishery of the giant bluefin tuna or \\"jumbo bluefin\\" (known by the scientific name of _Thunnus thynnus_) of New England waters, the author Douglas Whynott discusses fishermen who use other methods (such as trolling or using a purse seine) as well as problems that the fishing industry and that individual fishermen face in general as well as some topics in marine biology.<br /> The giant bluefin fishery is a lucrative market, with individual fish often worth $40 or more a pound (when fat after having feed all season on local prey fish), some fish bringing in at market prices as high as $50,000 per fish (though often much lower than that). The highest prices are obtained in Japan, where red tuna meat (maguro) is highly prized. Individual fish are packed in ice and air-lifted over to Japan, each specimen analyzed there at market in a method not unlike a raw diamond is regarded by professional jewelers so that the best cuts could be made, all so Japanese restaurant goers can pay upwards of $75 for a single serving of raw fish.<br /> Whynott relates how the bluefin tuna fishery has come a long way; the bluefin was once called the \\"horse mackerel\\" and worth a mere five cents a pound, generally being served as cat food. In fact in the early 20th century they were even thought to be poisonous and were primarily caught so that the fish could be boiled to produce lamp oil. Fishermen who specialized in bluefin have often had to get other jobs when the fishing season was over, whether fishing for cod or other fish, shrimping, harvesting mussels, or even working non-fishing jobs, something that has been slowly changing as the market for bluefin has become more lucrative though not still quite prevalent.<br /> The fish obtained for the sushi market are provided by the harpoon fishery of New England, an industry that while using spotter planes to locate schools, sophisticated devices to measure water temperature, and a knowledge of esoteric regulations in international committees and national organizations that govern quota size for each season's catches (regulations that are often the subject of intense debate, a topic well-covered in the book), Japanese market preferences (to properly grade fish often takes year of experience, as each fish taken to market is graded on freshness, color, fat, and shape), and even currency fluctuations (as upward or downward exchange rates of the yen versus the dollar can mean large differences in prices received), still relies on a single man hand-throwing a bronze-headed harpoon at a fast moving fish (albeit a harpoon rigged so that a powerful 800-volt electric shock can be delivered to the animal). No other method will do, as purse seining damages the fish and no other method can reliable catch the giant bluefins that the Japanese so highly prize. The harpooners operate from boats that are often called \\"stick boats,\\" constructed with long pulpits built off the bow and out over the water, the pulpit sometimes more than 25 feet in length (designed so that they could be cranked up while in harbor), a stand at the end of which is where the fishermen hurls his 12 foot harpoon.<br /> What made this book so interesting in part was the portrayal of individual fishermen, the author following their trials and tribulations over several seasons.  Whynott focused mainly on two fishermen - Bob Sampson, captain of the _Scratcher_ and his son Brad Sampson - and a spotter pilot, Fred Brooks or \\"Brooksie,\\" going out with them in all manner of weather, relating their hopes and aspirations and the many problems that they have faced. It was not hard not to root for them after a while.<br /> The tuna themselves are of course well-covered in the book, a fish species that arrives every year to the Gulf of Maine to fatten on the locally abundant schools of mackerel, sand eels, and herring, a rich feeding ground that attracts all manner of marine life including several species of sharks, whales, and porpoises, throughout the summer increasing their body weight by more than 7.5 percent per month. The bluefin is a fascinating animal, the largest of the finfish (up to ten feet in length and a thousand pounds in weight), among the fastest (which can swim in 50 mile an hour bursts, able to beat their tail fins at frequencies of thirty cycles per second, providing 90 percent of their locomotive power), and one of the most migratory of all animals (with some tagged individuals known to have made 8,000 mile round trips feeding and spawning forays through the Atlantic). Bluefins have a very sophisticated physiology, having large blood volumes and the highest proportion of oxygen among fishes, concentrations of hemoglobin as high as that of humans, their gill surface area the highest of any fish species, producing what is the metabolically active of all fish species; an animal that is \\"warm-blooded\\" or endothermic, able to maintain body temperatures of between 77 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit while swimming in waters between 45 and 86 degrees from Brazil to the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean to Norway. The bluefin is truly one of the ocean's top predators, essentially a tropical fish that has evolved to take advantage of underutilized food resources in subpolar waters.<br /> An absolutely excellent book, one I would highly recommend.	2004-02-02
US	52590451	RCMIEU9HY876N	1585742759	101502428	Parts Unknown: A Naturalist's Journey in Search of Birds and Wild Places	Books	5	5	6	N	N	good collection of essays on birds, chiefly birds of prey	This book is a collection of essays written by Tim Gallagher, currently editor-in-chief of _Living Bird_ magazine, published by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, as well as an avid nature photographer (several of his nice color photographs grace the book), birder, and wildlife aficionado. The articles were written from between the late 1970s into the year 2000, and apparently most if not all have been published before elsewhere (not saying I have read any of them mind you, but it is possible others who would be interested in this book have).<br /> The articles center around birds, though occasionally other animals are briefly discussed, and range from focusing on issues of research to conservation to some other topics such as law enforcement and research integrity. Many of the articles focus on birds of prey, particularly Peregrine Falcons and the epic fight to save them from near extinction due to DDT (a passion of his), but also Gyrfalcons, Prairie Falcons, Bald Eagles, the Ferruginous Hawk, and California Condors (also the subject of an intensive effort to save them from extinction, one that involved using the closely related Andean Condors among other things and seems to have paid off handsomely, with California Condors now back in the wild not only in California but in Arizona as well). Other birds are covered as well, sometimes in relation to being food to birds of prey, such as Dovekies, ptarmigans, and Red-necked Grebes. Though most of the essays dealt with bird-watching and research in the United States, he described those researching Gyrfalcons in Iceland (which often involved rappelling down sheer cliffs and wading through glacial streams that had claimed lives in the past) and both Gyrfalcons and Peregrine Falcons in Greenland (working in some very rugged arctic conditions) as well as the Ferruginous Hawk in Alberta. <br /> If I had any real complaint about the book was that some of the essays were entirely too short, almost seeming to me that just as theywere really getting interesting they were at an end. Some essays were only five pages or so, though most were longer. <br /> I did enjoy the book though, as he is a both a knowledgeable and personable writer and while passionate about conservation was not preachy about it. He did seem to have a wide-ranging interest in other animals, noting in some of his essays a little bit about some of the other animals that share the habitats with birds, such as ground squirrels, beavers, and whales, among others.<br /> I did learn a great many interesting things for which I am grateful. Gallagher relates how well-regarded the Gyrfalcon or falki is in Iceland, that even schoolchildren can identify them and that farmers who have them nesting on their lands are quite protective of them. Once exported to Europe as a prime bird for the sport of falconry, the favored prey of falconers in the Middle Ages using these birds was the Grey Heron (similar in appearance to the Great Blue Heron of North America), hunts involving them often involving miles of pursuit but generally ending in the heron's capture and then release with a copper band noting the name of the falcon's owner and the year captured. He writes quite a bit about the Dovekie, a starling-sized sea bird of arctic waters that looks in some ways penguin-like (though can fly). Studied intensively by researchers from the Peregrine Fund (important as a food source for birds of prey in the area and as a barometer of overall environment health in Greenland's waters), they are becoming known as amazingly long-lived birds, tremendously loyal to particular nesting sites (though preferring nesting on cliffs that have had recent rockslides as opposed to ones thickly covered in lichen), and the guano that they excrete on land important in a food chain that provides nitrogen for plants that musk oxen and arctic hairs feed on. In one of his chapters on reestablishing the Peregrine Falcon in eastern North America we learn that the famous urban releases of the falcon was do in part because young falcons that have been bred in captivity and released into the wild were too often falling prey to Golden Eagles and Great Horned Owls, birds that would not be present in an urban setting (though plenty of other birds such as feral pigeons and starlings, which could serve as prey items, were). In a chapter on Peregrine Falcon research he discusses findings unearthed by those studying migrating birds at Padre Island, Texas; in a break from their usual hunting habits, plummeting a high speed from a lofty altitude at prey, Peregrines would perch on any available spot on the island, even on crates and pieces of driftwood, where they would wait for other migrants (songbirds, shorebirds, waterfowl, and even other, smaller birds of prey) and take off from ground level and intercept them. <br />My favorite chapter was the one on researching the night-time calls of flying, migrating songbirds, the results of one tireless, self-financed researcher by the name of Bill Evans, who lacked even a master's degree. He set up recording stations using hi-fi VCRs at eventually seven different areas of New York State out of his own pocket, working odd jobs to support himself, and recorded nine hours of audio a night, analyzing the tapes himself and recording and verifying the sound of migrating birds such as warblers and thrushes using later visual observations. Putting together a data-base of such calls, the songs shorter and quite different from songs heard on the ground during mating, and publishing his findings, he pioneered a new field of studying migrating birds, a vast improvement over prior efforts which could count birds migrating at night but not identify species. Gallagher writes that more and more of these stations are being set up but are now using sophisticated audio equipment and pattern recognition software, the information being made available online and an invaluable tool to researchers and conservationists.	2004-01-26
US	52590451	R2A7BZY0P0XLP5	1571312455	447122695	Eccentric Islands: Travels Real and Imaginary	Books	5	7	7	N	N	A wonderful tour of real and imaginary islands	Author Bill Holm has produced in this work a wonderful, eclectic, almost at times rambling (but wonderfully so) tour of a number of islands. Many are actual islands he writes about, places where one can journey to; Madagascar, Isla Mujeres or the Island of Women near Cancun off the Mexican coast, Molokai (part of the Hawaiian Islands, once a leper colony, that chapter fascinating and touching centering as it does on the saintly efforts of Father Damien de Veuster and his care for the unfairly maligned and ill-treated lepers cruelly exiled there), and Mallard Island in Minnesota. Some islands he visits are not actual physical places, a few \\"states of consciousness\\" which he writes so \\"resemble islands that they deserve the geographic name,\\" such as the island of music (Holm, a great lover of pianos, clavichords, and harpsichords, describes how producing music can be an island-like experience in a wonderful, wide-ranging chapter that goes into a great deal of history behind these instruments) and the island of pain (how great physical or emotional pain can isolate oneself from others). Clearly this is a different travel book, one thematically organized rather than simply a description of places, experiences, and detailing the history, politics, cuisine, and culture of the particular places visited by the author.<br /> The largest section of the book - and my favorite part by far - was two rather lengthy chapters describing Holm's experiences in Iceland. A descendent of Icelandic immigrants who grew up in Minnesota, he spent time there in 1979 teaching English and then revisited the island again twenty years later. Clearly loving the place and the people especially, Holm provided for me a wonderful introduction of a place I would now very much like to visit. <br /> We learn that Iceland is a surprisingly small country, an isolated island in the North Atlantic about the size of Ohio (about 40,000 square miles), inhabited by about a quarter million people, most of whom live around the capital and largest city of Reykjavik, and that so sparse has the population of Iceland been through the centuries that only 800,000 Icelanders have ever lived (leading perhaps he says to the sometimes hobby sometimes obsession of many in Iceland with genealogy). A hard island to live on sometimes, first settled in 874 (though a few scattered Irish monks did call the place home before that), the population declined due to the Black Plague in the 14th century, smallpox in the early 18th century, and two large volcanic eruptions in 1783 and 1875, both of which caused massive famine by burying hayfields and killing sheep (it was due to the latter eruption that Holm's great-grandfathers moved to Minnesota). Indeed physically Iceland is a rugged country, subject to volcanic eruptions (the island is still growing, as the volcanic mid-Atlantic ridge bifurcates Iceland) and earthquakes (the author himself experienced a minor one in 1998), ninety percent barren lava and rugged volcanic desert, interspersed with several glaciers, tundra, and boiling fumaroles, occasionally tortured by fierce Arctic gale-force blasts of wind off the polar icecap. <br /> Holm describes a number of the most interesting places in Iceland, such as Pingvellir or the Parliament Plain, an oasis in the southwestern corner of the country where Icelanders first met in 1000 to respond to an ultimatum King Olaf of Norway to become Christian and stop horse eating and infant exposure, this meeting the foundation Icelandic law and the world's first true democracy (differing from the Greek in that in Iceland women could vote too), which with Gullfoss (Golden Falls, one of many magnificent waterfalls in the country), and Geysir (the original geyser, now largely spent and worn out) form the so-called Golden Triangle of tourist attractions in Iceland. <br /> I learned many interesting aspects of Icelandic culture. Icelanders for instance love to dress up to entertain - even in tuxedos and elegantdresses - even in the worst weather. They have a great love of giving flowers for nearly any occasion, even for mere visits over coffee. He was continually touched when even on his return he found that concerns of crime and even the security of their nation's leader were nearly non-existent. Holm sampled a number of Icelandic delicacies, including puffin, svartfugl (guillemot; a sea bird), italskt spaggetti (ground mutton, onion, and ketchup basically), svio (blackened, singed sheep's head), and lots of fish, preferred either boiled or prepared as siginn fiskur (fish hung, dried, and aged outdoors).<br />Outside the major cities many of those in rural Iceland - generally farmers - he found are often quite isolated; Holm found in 1979 that the national highway that circled the island was often a rough gravel track filled with pot-holes, 16-percent grades down steep mountainsides, and areas where the road was completely washed out even. He found quite a bit of improvement upon his return twenty years later but still many areas were a challenging drive. Indeed he took advantage of this isolation on his first visit there to live for a summer with an Icelandic farming family; Holm wanted to learn to speak Icelandic to a better degree (having great trouble with its \\"consonantal clots, trilled rs, and long soulful diphthongs\\"), but found that in the major cities everyone spoke English fluently and generally did not let him \\"butcher\\" their language - only in an isolated rural settlement were there people who spoke little or no English. Iceland is a very much a nation of writers and of readers, producing many fine novelists - several of which have been translated into English - as well as the famous Icelandic sagas. The author was touched upon his first trip to find people in restaurants, stores, and in their cars enthralled by a reading of one of the nation's great novels, Halldor Laxness's _Independent People_, glued to the radio as the story of Bjartur of Summerhouses unfolded, a saga centering around an uneducated, gruff sheep farmer whose all-consuming desire to be independent and beholden to no one leads to tragic consequences for him and his family. <br /> A wonderful book.	2004-01-22

Yemen we find out once hosted powerful pre-Islamic civilizations, South Arabian states like Saba, Ma'in (whose massive and expertly produced stone works later overawed the Romans), Qaban, and Hadramawt, wealthy merchant kingdoms that grew rich on their tight control of aromatic gums - particularly frankincense and myrrh as well as cinnamon brought from India - in great demand among the Pharaonic Egyptians for medicine and for the process of mummification, by the Assyrians, by the Greeks, the Romans, the ancient kingdoms growing rich on spices rather than oil. Many of the lands were cultivated thanks to the Marib Dam - a massive structure that finally collapsed in the sixth century, that according to legend was destroyed by a rat with iron teeth - or to very impressive irrigation works, via stone tunnels cut into the living rocks of the mountains, some tunnels 150 yards long and big enough to drive a car through and still used to supply water to highland villages over 2000 years after they were built.  With the collapse of this civilization - linked by many to the collapse of the Marib Dam - there was a Yemeni diaspora of sorts, as many Yemenis were in the vanguard of the early conquering armies of Islam, spreading throughout the Arab world as far as East Africa, Ethiopia, Iraq, Syria, Tunisia, and even Spain. Later on the Rasulid sultans ruled southern Yemen between the 13th and 15th centuries, making their capital of Ta'izz a wealthy and cosmopolitan capital, its rulers patrons of many of the sciences, producing astrolabes and magnetic compasses while the rest of the Islamic world was inruins thanks to the Mongols.  Modern Yemeni history is also well covered though I found it at times confusing. <br /> The author visited many areas of Yemen. He hiked down canyons and dry wadi (seasonally dry river beds), warned by the locals of the tahish, a cow-sized, hyena like Yemeni bogeyman, though more likely in danger of the sayl, a roaring chest-high wall of water that can suddenly fill canyons thanks to distant highland rains. He viewed many mountain villages and homes perched precariously over such wadi, its citizens living on centuries-old terraces carved into the mountain, designed to catch and slow the descent of every bit of precious water that rains upon the mountains.  He sampled a great variety of Yemeni foods, such as saltah (stew based on vegetables and broth topped by hulbah,  fenugreek flour whisked to a froth with water), rawbah (soured milk from which the fat has been removed to make butter, popular on the island of Suqutra), qishr (a drink made from the husks of coffee beans, the bean of which have long been a major Yemeni export), and baghiyyah honey, said to the finest in the world and produced only in Yemen by bees pasturing only on ilb trees. He encountered a few of the Jews of Yemen, only a few thousand of which are left, identified by their corkscrew curl side locks. He viewed a bara', an Islamic tribal festival still practiced in the mountains, looking like a dance but more akin to a medieval tournament, a place to display skill with weapons and with heavy connotations of honor and tribal solidarity. He wrote of the qabili - the mountain tribesmen - who are regarded by city dwellers as yokels but also regarded with pride as part of their ancestry, regarding them as honorable people, ones practicing great hospitality to strangers, with many symbolically becoming a tribesmen by adoption of the asib, the tribesman's upright dagger. He visited those who were sayyid, male descendents of the Prophet, often whom devote their lives to Qur'anic knowledge, forming a class that has long had a critical role in Yemeni politics and religion. He visited Aden, one of the greatest ports in the world, its \\"craggy profile\\" formed by volcanic activity, a weird city thanks to local topography, not \\"one city but a series of settlements separated by outriders of the central peak, Jabal Shamsan,\\" many of those settlements quite distinct in character, a city once contested by the Ottomans, the French, and held by the British for the better part of two centuries. He visited two sub-cultures within Yemen that don't always Arabic; the Mahris, located east of Hud along al-Masilah, racially distinct and following the very un-Arabic matrilineal descent system, and the native peoples of Suqutra, who until relatively recently many did not speak Arabic at all but rather Suqutri. Indeed the Island of Suqutra, once called the Island of Dragon's Blood thanks to one of its most famous exports, a blood red resin from the dragon's blood tree (_Dracaena cinnabari_, actually a member of the Lily family), is the subject of the last chapter, an island 260 miles from the Yemeni mainland, closer to Somalia than to Yemen, a country that once practiced very un-Islamic adult public circumcisions and witch trails into the late 1960s.<BR> <BR>Well covered is one of the most famous and unique aspects of Yemeni culture, the chewing of qat. A dicotyledon known to science as _Catha edulis_, it is chewed by groups of men socially, the qat chews often important arenas for the transaction of business, discussions of politics and religion, to accompany weddings and funerals, or simply to unwind with friends. Qat is recognized to have a huge variety of sub-types by many Yemeni connoisseurs, with many esoteric rules; qat from a tree over a grave is to be avoided, and qat from lower branches (qatal) is the least prized of qat. <br />I really enjoyed this book, which boasted some interesting sketch book type illustrations, a glossary, and a good bibliography.	2004-01-14
US	52590451	RE162J24BE812	0679758526	63274353	This Cold Heaven: Seven Seasons in Greenland	Books	5	3	4	N	N	A paean to the Inuit and to Greenland	\\"This Cold Heaven\\" is more than anything an ode, a paean to Greenland by one woman. I think in some ways she loves that icebound land as much as Lawrence of Arabia was reported to love the desert, and perhaps for somewhat similar reasons. Her book was full of poetic descriptions of towering icebergs, driving snowstorms, crisp nearly eternal nights, and sheets of mirror-like ice. Admiring the vast ice sheet covering the island, which she described as \\"a siren singing me back to Greenland, its walls of sapphire blue and sheer immensity always beguiling,\\" she really put me there on that island. An American writer, she was drawn to Greenland again and again over the better part of a decade and in this book she chronicles her experiences there as well as much information on Greenland, chiefly about the Inuit people of that land, though to a lesser extent about some of its fauna, flora, geology, and climate. She recounts her travels - mainly by dogsled, but also by boat and helicopter - throughout this largest island in the world, a land under which 95% of it is still locked in ice, a land in which some say the Ice Age never ended at all.<br /> The stars of the book are the Inuit, both as a people and as individuals. Clearly a people she greatly admires both as a culture and as individuals, the reader will learn much about them, descendents of Asians who crossed the Bering Land Bridge from Siberia perhaps 30,000 years, settling Greenland some 5,000 years ago. Their culture - stretching some 6,000 miles from Greenland through Alaska - is a surprisingly unified one, largely speaking the same language and telling the same stories. Indeed not only have they been very unified across distances on land but also across distances in time; many Inuit in Greenland are still essentially using stone and bone age technology (though one increasingly threatened by the arrival of modern technology and the Danish welfare state), even creating string figure art of woolly mammoths, a uniquesocietal memory of a species extinct for many thousands of years.<br /> The Inuit we find are often a people of vivid contrasts and to us perhaps strange habits. Though they enjoy the summer time, which in their part of the world is short though one of unending daylight, they most enjoy the completely dark winters, something perhaps counterintuitive to those not native there; it is only in the dark time of the year that fjords and bays are ice, allowing long sled trips for hunting and for visiting friends. Clocks and calendars are nearly meaningless to the Inuit; Ehrlich often found it to be the case either in the unending night of winter (we also learn by the way that the Inuit word for \\"winter\\" also means \\"a year\\") or in the unending day of summer people would be awake at any hour, whether to fix dinner, socialize, or begin a hunt. One on occasion when a visitor remarked that a dogsled expedition should be gotten off to an early start, Ehrlich recounted how one of the Inuit laughed, stating that their day had more hours. <br /> Inuit food may appear equally strange to the typical American or European; they eat a virtually all- meat diet, the climate and terrain of Greenland completely unsuited to agriculture. Seal, walrus, polar bear, whale, dovekie, auk, and fish are the mainstays of Inuit diet, many times boiled or dried, sometimes eaten raw. One of the more interesting foods they eat is kivioq, a delicacy made from dead auks sewn into a seal gut and left to rot for two months. Though upsetting many Western environmentalists, Ehrlich does an excellent job of showing how the Inuit hunt for survival, not for profit or ritual. Many times she went on dogsled expeditions during which if a hunt for seal was unsuccessful dogs and later people would starve. Clearly the Inuit of Greenland hunt for food and for furs to make warm clothing, doing so with the greatest respect for the animals. Any money they made from their hunts went to buy necessities, such as fuel oil or pencils for children in school. <br /> Ehrlich makes much of the strange dichotomy of seeming cruelty and community. On the one hand during times of hardship, after their much beloved (and utterly important) dogs were eaten (as well as their sleds; we find that in the past that sleds were sometimes constructed of edible materials, with skins soaked in water and frozen into place for runners and even solid frozen chunks of salmon or seal flesh for other parts) the Inuit would turn to cannibalism, even eating their own children. The very old were often expected to die if they became a burden to their community, and orphans, particularly if outsiders, could often be quite harshly treated. Inuit parents she noted often laughed at their children's misfortunes as they learned to handle a sled or hunt, all in an effort to teach them survival skills, however cruel that might appear to an outsider. On the other hand though, the Inuit could be thought of the ideal Communists to some degree; no one owned land. When meat was available, it was freely shared to all who needed. Dogs were always fed first (though this was not entirely altruistic, as aside from kayaks in water this was their chief means of locomotion) and even widows in villages would share in the bounty of a great hunt. Ehrlich spends a good deal of the book recounting the adventures and travels of the ethnographer Knud Rasmussen (a Danish researcher who launched seven expeditions between 1910 and 1933 to study the Inuit people all over Greenland and west to Siberia) and his friend Peter Freuchen, clear outsiders who were warmly welcomed into village after village, whose lived were saved by Inuit, people who brought them into their homes, shared their food, their stories, their way of life. <br /> A wonderful book.	2003-12-30
US	52590451	R327I4F6QFGHMI	0002572168	479363838	The Sea Kingdoms: The History of Celtic Britain and Ireland	Books	5	17	18	N	N	a fantastic book of Celtic history and culture	Alistair Moffat has produced in this work one of the most intriguing and informative history books I have read in some time, covering the Celtic peoples, history, and traditions of Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Cornwall, and the Isle of Man (and to a much lesser extent Brittany in northern France) as well as of England itself. Too often the history of the British Isles is the history of the English, and in this book he seeks to show an entire element of British history now largely forgotten. <br /> Very importantly Moffat defines just what the term Celtic means. Celts are not defined by their race or by their place of birth; rather the Celts of Britain are a speech community. At one time an older version of Welsh was spoken all over the island of Britain and Irish Gaelic was the common tongue of Ireland; they were both cousin languages, sharing syntax and vocabulary, though later becoming mutually unintelligible. The very language of the Celts has often been at the core of their identity from early times, as the Celts have long believed that if their language fell from use that their nation - whether Welsh, Irish, or other - would from fade from history. The opponents of the Celts understood this and for centuries have attacked their language, seeking to eliminate its use from government, the courts, churches and schools, full well realizing that to fully dominate the Celts they had to be rid of their unifying and defining language. As the author summarizes; the war for Britain \\"was as much a war of words as of blood and steel.\\" <br /> Celts were also linked by the sea, hence the title of this book. For centuries the sea was a much better highway than land, and once the ocean linked a Celtic community that stretched to mainland Europe, including modern Portugal, Spain, and France. Indeed the sea was often the focus of much more effort than land, with castles once constructed more to guard stretches of sea rather than areas of land, and the powerful Lord of the Isles starting in the mid-14th century ruling his Sea Kingdom from a movable court at sea, with the islands of Islay and Tiree serving as an administrative center and granary respectively. <br /> Very often we see in this book that the story of the Celtic peoples is the story for the war for Britain. The Romans, the Anglo-Saxons, the Normans, the English, and the British won that war he writes, a victory more or less complete by the end of the18th century. This is a history written by the victors; too often the side of the losers was not told, or improperly told, aided by the fact that the Celts were largely a non-literate (though not illiterate) culture, greatly valuing oral tradition but for the most part not embracers of the written word. Indeed Moffat spends much time analyzing the English and modern view that only written sources should be valued and oral sources are automatically suspect, a view that has cost the world a vast store of history, culture, and literature. <br /> The Celtic lands were by no means completely non-literate; in a striking paradox the Irish monks were noted producers of written material, preserving much ancient Greek and Roman knowledge and literature that might have otherwise been lost. Indeed the saga of the Celtic and particularly Irish monks fills several fascinating chapters; members of this group may have even visited North America prior to Columbus.<br /> Today the Celtic speech community is largely extinct. Cornish and Manx possess no native speakers, the ancient words only on the lips of enthusiasts. Scots Gaelic will likely become extinct within a generation and Irish is in decline as well; only Welsh shows any real strength. Efforts are being made to preserve the Celtic languages, not out of any \\"weird, woolly, quaint, or daft\\" dream of supplanting English, but merely to seek to preserve ancient traditions and knowledge of Celtic history and culture. Language preservation is all the more important when one realizes that Celtic historyoften lacks obvious ruins, with little to compare to say the Valley of the Kings or the Parthenon. <br /> Perhaps even more damaging Moffat writes is that Celtic history is in serious dangerous of being reduced to quaint local color and comfortable entertainment, something more suited to the tourist trade and Hollywood than real history, and unfortunately much Celtic history that is known to the public is a fairly recent invention. The Highland Clearances of the 19th century saw the removal of thousands from the Scottish Highlands, leading to the myth - much embraced by many from Victorian painters to modern filmmakers - of the lonely, windswept, majestic wilderness that was an entirely artificial creation. The kilt most well known today is more properly called the feileadh beag or small kilt and is actually the creation of an 18th century English factory owner to aid employees in his ironworks; even the word kilt is from the Danish kilte, which means \\"to tuck up.\\" Even the tradition of identifying certain tartan patterns (or setts) with certain clan names dates largely back to a book published in 1842 that was largely made-up. The much-loved Welsh tradition of the Gorsedd, a three-day convention of bards and druids, was mostly made up by Edward Williams (who later called himself Iolo Morgannwg), a skilled 18th century Welsh scholar who created much of what is popularly thought of about bards and particularly the Druids (though interweaving so much actual history, rituals, and literature that it has taken entire academic careers to distinguish fact from his fancy). Even when it became known that his (and that of another proponent of druidism, William Price) culture never really existed as such, many still embraced their efforts as part of a national Welsh revival and something decidedly un-English. <br /> A fascinating book, covering many aspects of the Celts; from the bold Border Reivers to the real Rob Roy to Irish nationalism to Cornish wrestling.	2003-12-29

Rather the small war, many rather small-scale engagements that often involved few or no casualties, has been far more common. <br />In reality there have been four types of small wars engaged in by American forces; punitive (to punish attacks made against American lives or property), protective (designed to safeguard these American lives and property), pacification (to occupy a foreign territory), and profiteering (to grab territory or trade concessions), with some operations serving more than one purpose. Boot chronicles these wars through three major periods of American history; from the late 1700s to the 1890s when the U.S. was a growing commercial though not a military power; from 1898 to 1941 when the U.S. was one of the great powers; and from 1941 when the U.S. was a superpower. Boot notes the changes in mission objectives, strategies, and results in these three eras of American military and foreign policy history.<br />The bulk of this work chronicles these small wars, from the Barbary Pirates war in the early 19th century through our actions in Samoa in 1899, the expedition to China during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, the Philippine War (1899-1902), the U.S. intervention in the Russian Civil War in 1918-1920 (which made for harrowing reading), various deployments and occupations in Cuba, Panama, Nicaragua, Mexico, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic in the first half of the 20th century (including the famous expedition against Pancho Villa), the actions of the Yangtze River Patrol in China, up to the Vietnam War. This history makes for gripping reading, providing mewith a history I know little or nothing about, one filled with personal stories of men who should be famous but who instead are largely forgotten today. We are introduced to such individuals as William Eaton, an \\"early-day Lawrence of Arabia\\" who was a U.S. consul to Tunis who helped organized a native and foreign army to dispose the pasha of Tripoli during the Barbary Wars. Another interesting one was Captain David Porter of the U.S. Navy, captain of the _Essex_, who while fighting the British in the Pacific in 1813 crossed 2,500 miles of ocean, put into the Marquesas Islands for repairs, and ended up becoming involved in a native war, trying to annex the islands for the U.S. One of the major stars of this work was Smedly Butler, according to some possibly the greatest Marine who ever lived, who fought in the Spanish-American War, Philippine War, Boxer Uprising, Nicaragua, at Veracruz, Haiti, and again in China in 1927, winning several Medals of Honor, though after retiring becoming an avowed pacifist and opponent of such conflicts. <br />  I found his section on the Vietnam War enlightening, analyzing it in the context of the small wars that had occurred before. He notes some of the reasons as to why that war did not end in success; among them the South Vietnamese were trained as a miniature version of the American army, rather than as a much more effective constabulary force - part army, part police - one focused on internal defense, a type that had been highly effective for the US in the Caribbean, the Philippines, and elsewhere; the U.S. was not in direct command of locally recruited soldiers, as South Vietnamese soldiers were often picked for political rather than competence reasons, again contrary to prior U.S. experience in small wars; and one successful program, the Combined Action Program or CAP, which relied on small groups of U.S. soldiers paired with native soldiers stationed to particular villages, concentrating on knowing local villagers and patrolling the region, rather than on ambitious and ultimately frustrating and wasteful \\"search and destroy\\" missions in the Highlands and elsewhere, was not adequately supported, despite evidence both in Vietnam and in previous small wars that such programs worked and were even popular with U.S. troops and local citizens.<br />Boot closes the book with a highly useful section on analyzing the future of small wars in American foreign and defense policy. He notes that despite claims that the first Gulf War eliminated the Vietnam Syndrome, American military planners and presidents have been too timid in their deployments overseas, too afraid of generating casualties (particularly for humanitarian missions), believing that the only wars that will achieve any degree of support with the American people are the \\"sanitized, high-tech warfare\\" such as was attempted in Kosovo in the late 1990s. Boot writes that not only will this very policy backfire (crippling mission goals and encouraging enemies to attack American forces even more in the belief that any American casualties will force the military to leave their country, among other reasons), but that it is erroneous at its very heart. He writes that in fact the American public is often more motivated in its support of military missions abroad by such factors as the \\"odds of success and the stakes involved\\" rather than purely by body count, even if the mission is not purely one dictated by obvious goals centering on national security. He even notes that sometimes casualties can actually increase support for a mission, either for reasons of wanting revenge or notions that those who died should not have died in vain. He cautions that the Powell Doctrine not withstanding (stating that the U.S. should only get involved in wars with a clear national interest, with overwhelming force, and with a clear exit strategy), we will always face wars in which these things will be lacking and that we should prepare for this, wars that while limited in objectives and methods can achieve notable successes.	2003-12-08
US	52590451	R37QE9NP2PJ5UM	0609607960	540694710	Kangaroo Dreaming: An Australian Wildlife Odyssey	Books	5	7	7	N	N	great book on Australian natural history	I read this book just after having finished Bill Bryson's travel book on Australia, &quot;In A Sunburned Country,&quot; and the contrast could not be more vivid. Bryson focused mainly on the cities, towns, and people of Australia, and I believe he only saw a few kangaroos in his entire sojourn there. Though he did cover some natural history, most of his work was focused on the human history and culture of Australia. Kanze on the other hand on his massive journey around Australia with his wife Debbie spent very little time in cities, trying to avoid urban areas for the most part, and saw a great deal of wildlife, including probably hundreds of kangaroos. In fact, the principal reason they flew to Australia, bought a car, and spent the better part of a year driving around the continent/country (including Tasmania) was to see a bewildering array of plants, animals, and natural landscapes in the &quot;bush.&quot;<br />The author introduces the reader to a many animals, some familiar, many not. We meet a wide variety of kangaroos, including the \\"big four,\\" the common wallaroo (known as the \\"euro\\" in Western Australia), the red kangaroo, the eastern grey, and the western grey, as well as the musky rat-kangaroo, most \\"primitive\\" of kangaroos, smaller than a housecat, distinct in that hops on four feet rather than two, carries nest material with its tail, and is the only kangaroo that raises two young at a time rather than the usual one . They encounter the sugar glider, a marsupial that is strikingly similar to the flying squirrel of North America, one that feeds on the excretions of sap-feeing insects and eucalyptus resin, something few marsupials can digest. A wide variety of parrots (the continent possesses fifty-six species) also amazes the Kanzes when they encountered them in virtually any setting, from rain forest to desert to the middle of large cities. They meet koalas several times, a strange animal that Kanze informs us actually for a time grew more common afterEnglish settlement, as Aborigine hunting of them declined as their own populations retreated before the Europeans, only to suffer in turn when koalas caught the fancy of London furriers. They run into the ubiquitous termite mounds of Queensland, thousands of which tower over the landscape up to eight feet in height, vital to the local ecology as they serve the function of earthworms, which are unable to survive the monsoonal inundations of the local landscape. Interestingly, we learn that at least some termite species build their mounds with their broad fronts parallel to the earth's magnetic poles, one end pointing to magnetic south, the other magnetic north, with the mounds thus situated to soak up morning and afternoon sunshine but only present a thin edge to the blistering midday sun. They meet the potentially dangerous cassowary, a huge flightless bird able to run thirty miles an hour, jump five feet into the air, and disembowel a man with the slash of a talon. Advised to hide and freeze should they encounter one in the forest, the Kanzes run into an overcurious youngster and its protective parent at one point, a situation that could have ended in disaster. Told that if one froze they might be missed, as their eyesight is poor, a comment that to me brought to mind \\"Jurassic Park,\\" a thought the author apparently shared.  Kanze roots around underwater with a snorkel and mask for the elusive Arafura file snake, not formerly described until 1980, a snake with unusually loose but rough skin that uses to grip slippery fish, a water snake that hunts, sleeps, breeds, and gives birth without leaving the water. Among the many other animals they meet and describe for the reader are the manatee-like dugong, honey possums (the only terrestrial mammal to subsist entirely on pollen and nectar), Tasmanian devils,  the hated alien cane toad, a wide variety of native frogs, bowerbirds, bandicoots, platypuses, flying foxes, dingoes, echidnas (also know as spiny anteaters), lyrebirds, sunbirds, and a wide variety of reptiles including sea turtles, pythons, many poisonous snakes, goannas (among the largest lizards alive today, goanna being the Australian name for a monitor lizard, the name probably a corruption of &quot;iguana&quot;), and crocodiles (both freshwater and saltwater varieties). <br />I learned a lot about Australian wildlife and landscapes and some about Australian history and culture and really enjoyed the book, but do offer a few small complaints. Kanze repeatedly compares his journey throughout Australia to that of Odysseus and his trials that were described in \\"The Odyssey.\\" While sometimes the comparisons were apt and even mildly humorous, sometimes they seemed a bit forced and even slightly tedious, with occasional asides into Greek mythology that seemed out of place. Second, many times Kanze mentions taking pictures of a variety of animals throughout his journey, yet there is only the cover picture; nowhere are there are photographs in the book. I would have liked to have seen a few pictures at least of landscapes. <br />Having said that though, this is a very good Australian travel and natural history book, one I would recommend.	2003-12-01
US	52590451	R2C1PY5DCYSRW8	0767903862	430278994	In a Sunburned Country	Books	5	6	9	N	N	very fun travel book on Australia	This was a delightful book, one that I read within two days and left me just salivating for not only for more from Bill Bryson, truly one of the best travel writers and one of the finest humorists writing these days, but for more on Australia! Just as Bryson says at the end of his travels in Australia he wanted to push one to just one more destination, I too wanted him to do that, and will be sure to find more interesting books to read on that wonderful country (and continent). <BR> <BR>Bryson says it best when he writes that not only the many interesting bits of human and natural history but the entire country itself are often &quot;unaccountably overlooked.&quot; His travels throughout the tropics, deserts, and cities of Australia show that it is a &quot;preposterously outsized&quot; country completely filled with &quot;unappreciated wonders.&quot; Bryson clearly loves Australia (and says so numerous times) and goes to great pains to show us the real Australia, the Australia off the beaten path as it were, many times an Australia that many Australians themselves never see, doing so with respect, humor, and a sense of wonder. <br />What are some of these &quot;unappreciated wonders&quot; you may ask? Did you know that in 1967 prime minister Harold Holt was strolling along the beach in Victoria and vanished without a trace, his body never found? I've never read about that anywhere! Or that a large-scale disturbance was recorded by seismographs on May 28, 1993 in the Great Victoria Desert of Western Australia, one that may have been the results of an atomic explosion detonated by the Japanese cult Aum Shinrinkyo? The country is so vast and the deserts so remote and exceedingly hard to survive in that the it was four years before the explosion was ever investigated. News about Australia he notes so rarely reaches the outside world; it is almost as if it were on its own planet. <BR> <BR>Australia as you probably know is home to a great deal of interesting wildlife. Thought not really a natural history writer Bryson does cover some of these interesting animals, some in some detail, such as the box jellyfish (most deadly jellyfish in the world, so awful that victims have been known to scream even when rendered unconscious), the cassowary (flightless, man-sized bird of the rain forests armed with a razor-sharp claw on each foot), the blue-ringed octopus (&quot;whose caress is instant death&quot;), salt water crocodiles (which do occasionally he notes attack boats and even eat people), twelve-foot long earth worms, wombats, the platypus, the dromedary camel (gone feral in the Outback, only place in the world where it can be found in the wild), and the taipan (Australia's deadliest snake). Interesting organisms are not limited to the animal kingdom, as Bryson visits the stromatolites of Shark Bay in Western Australia (essentially living rocks colonized by cyanobacteria, an example of life that was dominant on Earth 3.5 billion years ago) and the karri (the sequoia of Australia, with can be up to 250 feet high and 50 feet around, found in the forests with the jarrah tree, nearly as large).<BR> <BR>Bryson though is at his best when he tours the cities, towns, and hole-in-the wall places of Australia, from Perth to Sydney to Melbourne to Alice Springs and beyond. In Australia's capital, Canberra, he finds a very unusual city, one with such a huge amount of space devoted to landscaping that it was essentially one &quot;extremely large park with city hidden in it,&quot; though he did note that it was quite an achievement to virtually hide a city of 330,000 among so many trees, meadows, and lakes. While there he tries to make sense of Australia's national politics, a subject he finds nearly hopelessly confusing (not aided by the fact that little news get out about Australia to aid one in tracking it), though does appreciate the more colorful language used by some in Parliament House (such as the phrases hopeless nong and mangy maggot). He visits both Sydney (home to its famous harbor, Harbour Bridge, and the Opera House) and Melbourne, two cities that forever are to be rivals within Australia, cities that have competed for hosting the Olympic games and are the butts of each other's jokes. He marvels at Alice Springs, a city that is literally nearly thousands of miles down desert highway in the barren interior yet is a major city complete with K-Marts and thriving on tourism from Ayers Rock.  He visits Perth, the most remote large city on Earth, built on the fabulous mineral wealth of Western Australia, a city somewhat closer to Singapore than it is to Sydney. Bryson revels at the glorious late 1950s feel of some areas of rural Australia (a feeling extending even to the music seemingly favored on the radio) and the punishing heat and bewildering solitude of the desert. <br />Bryson covers a lot of territory not only in terms of geography but also culture and history, discussing Australia's views of their country, its fascination with outlaw &quot;heroes&quot; from its past such as Ned Kelly, their views on government, the sport of cricket, Australian immigration and multiculturalism, the history of the exploration of its desert interior as well as its early settlement, and the story of the Aborigines, both their origins and the history of how they were treated (and are being treated) by White Australia. <br />A great book, I really recommend it.	2003-11-15
US	52590451	R33FGN0MOCFZ37	0393051404	386506024	Monster of God: The Man-Eating Predator in the Jungles of History and the Mind	Books	5	24	24	N	N	exceptional book on mythology, history, and biology	I really enjoyed this exceptional book on the mythology, culture, history, and biology of man-eaters around the world. Though he primarily focuses on four specific animals - the Asiatic lion in the forest of Gir in India, the saltwater crocodile in northern Australia, the brown bear in the forests and mountains of Romania, and the Siberian (or more properly Amur) tiger of the Russian Far East- author David Quammen discusses other predators as well, such as the African lion, the grizzly of North America, the Nile crocodile, and the leopard as well as some now extinct species. <br />Quammen does an excellent job of covering just about any aspect you might wish to learn about animals that occasionally dine on man. Aspects of ecology are very well covered, introducing the reader to many key concepts in ecology (particularly as they relate to these creatures), such as the terms alpha predator, keystone species, and trophic cascades, showing that for a healty ecosystem - including healthy plants and prey animals - the presence of a viable population of predator is crucial. The education this book gave me on ecology was quite remarkable, with the author going into very readable detail on many issues and very interestingly their history as well, showing some of the personalities behind their conception. The individual biology and paleontology of each of the focus species in this book are well covered, as well as that of close and more distant relations, covering everything from the rise and fall of sabertooth mammals (feline and otherwise) to the spread of the tiger species throughout Asia (and its later evolution into various subspecies). <br />Equally interesting - and valuable - in this work Quammen goes into great detail about the interaction between humans and the top predators throughout world history as well as the situation to date. How have large predators - such as perhaps cave bears and cave lions - shaped the evolution (physically and culturally) of ancient peoples? How have such animals shaped the development of human art, literature, mythology, and religion? Quammen brings into this rather engrossing discussion everything from Babylonian epics to Beowulf to Tolkien. <br />Quammen does not only focus on the animals, but on their sometime victims as well. He looks at how have native peoples dealt with man-eaters in the past and how do traditional peoples deal with them today. Quammen is very sensitive to the lives of those who face (and occassionally feed) these predators, really bringing to life for the reader such diverse groups as the Malhadris of India, the Udege of Russia, and the shepherds of Romania. Quammen vividly contrasts this with looking at how has the coming of colonial enterprises and regimes (such as the British in India and Australia) changed interactions with local alpha predators. <br />Perhaps most importantly, this book asks what does the future hold for such predators? Will they always have a guaranteed place in the wild, outside of zoos and circuses? How can one make sure that they do? There is quite a debate raging on how to make sure that forests still stalk the snowy forests of the Russian Far East and the billabongs of steamy northern Australia and Quammen provides excellent coverage of all sides. <br />A very valuable and entertaining book, it has a very extensive bibilography as well. I highly recommend it.	2003-11-12
US	52590451	R25OVH30BMO1CE	0862419964	401690791	Hokkaido Highway Blues: Hitchhiking Japan	Books	5	3	4	N	N	funny and informative look at Japan	I really enjoyed this book. I won't lie to you the reader of this review and say it was the ultimate book one should get on Japan, that it answered every question I had about that nation, but I did learn a lot and it was very funny at times. It is not as one might guess a serious scholarly account of the nation, but it is a fun travelogue. <br />The author, Will Ferguson, was an English teacher living in southern Japan and gets the idea one (drunken) evening at a hanami (cherry blossom party) to follow the Sakura Zensen (the &quot;Cherry Blossom Front&quot;) as it advanced from south to north through the country with the approaching spring. Further, he had the idea to hitchhike the entire time, avoiding trains, planes, and buses (though in a few cases he had to take a public ferry to get from one island to another). Beginning at Cape Sata in southernmost Kyushu, he made it all the way to Cape Soya in Hokkaido (and then afterwards to nearby Rishiri Island).<br />Though having lived in the country for several years and having become fairly proficient in Japanese, Ferguson is still cleary the outsider, the gaijin, and writes in his travels that he will always be the outsider, perhaps welcomed, even liked, but never truly excepted (and in some instances very unwelcome). Though he may develop friendships and even romantic interests with Japanese people, he will always be clearly not Japanese in their eyes. Ferguson shows that in some cases in the book this prevented him from really either understanding or participating in some things, while in other instances it allowed him access to people's thoughts, emotions, and homes, access that a native Japanese person would not have had. <br />The author writes of many fascinating, informative, and sometimes hilarious stories and ancedotes on a variety of topics, such as the size, structure, and decoration of Japanese homes, Godzilla and his fandom (with one city begging to be demolished in the next movie), sumo wrestling, Japanese attempts at making coffee, the yamabushi (strange mystic mountain men), Shintoism and shinto shrines, the famous Bridge of Heaven (a tourist attraction best viewed he writes by turning around, bending over, and looking at from between your legs according to tradition), Japanese monkeys, and love hotels. <br />This book was a lot of fun, one I would recommend to anyone interested in Japan or just nicely done, humorous travel writing.	2003-11-10

Covering events from 1974 to 1989, it does not cover the Eugenics Wars per se, but the events leading up to them, largely centering around the origins of Khan Noonien Singh (and his genetically enhanced brothers and sisters) and of Khan's boyhood and early adulthood.<BR> <BR> The first volume at least might be well sub-titled \\"The Further Adventures of Gary Seven, Roberta Lincoln, and Isis,\\" characters we first encountered in a Star Trek: The Original Series (TOS) episode set in 1968 Earth, where Kirk and company encounter a genetically enhanced human operative from an alien world (operating for a mysterious organization called the Aegis), posted on Earth to save humans from themselves (mostly from nuclear annihilation). Readers may remember that Roberta Lincoln was a young woman native to Earth that became caught up in events in that TOS episode and subsequently became an agent working for Gary Seven. Isis is never really truly explained, but is apparently an alien cat that is able to take the shape of a human woman at times and is highly intelligent. Together the three have apparently had many adventures much in the mold of James Bond, playing behind the scenes spy games to save the world countless times. It is in this role that they become involved in the events described in the book, namely trying to discover what is happening to the some of the world's top geneticists (who are disappearing) and rumors of some mysterious organization that is dabbling in genetic engineering and biological warfare.<br /> I do not intend my statement that the book focuses on those three as a criticism, as it is understandable that they are the main characters, if for no other reason then that Khan (\\"Noon\\" as a child) and his enhanced brethren are children for much of the book. Khan for the main adventure of the book isbarely present or marginally involved most of the time, though later in the book becomes more and more important as he grows up and starts to flex some of his tremendous abilities.<br /> Genetic engineering is an understandable theme running through the book; Khan and his \\"supermen,\\" the genetically enhanced nature of Gary Seven, the villainous geneticists in the book, and a framing story set not long after the first encounter with Khan in TOS episode, where Kirk is considering a request by the Paragon Colony on the planet Sycorax request to join the Federation, a human colony long isolated from the Federation and one that had a population comprised entirely of genetically enhanced individuals. The framing story - the \\"present\\" of the novel - is interesting though rarely visited, and is a tool for telling the main plot of the novel, as it shows Kirk researching the history of the Eugenics Wars as preparation to the decisions he has to make upon arrival at the colony. <br />  I really enjoyed the interweaving of the novel's plot with previously established events in Star Trek history in the past (such as Kirk and company's visit to 1986 San Francisco to look for whales) and in real world history, many of which are quite cleverly made fundamental parts of the storyline, their importance taking on a whole new light. These historical events are addressed in a nice after word at the end of the book.<br /> All in all I really liked the book; Greg Cox is certainly one of the best Star Trek writers out there. The writing that produced the previous book of his that I read, his excellent Q Continuum Trilogy, is still top notch evidently, demonstrating a very good grasp of the characters and history of the Star Trek universe. My only minor criticism is the cover has little to do with the events of the novel; it appears to show American forces fighting Vietnam (not a part of the novel) and shows Khan a bit older than he appears in the story.	2003-07-14
US	52590451	R39IFED99Q8SND	0138700982	753744400	The Sun Never Sets: Travels to the Remaining Outposts of the British Empire	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Both entertaining and somber account of Empire today	Inspired by a newspaper article about a British island he had never heard of, author Simon Winchester made a grand tour of the modern British Empire (the book was published in 1985). Like many, he originally thought that the Empire was no more, that most of the colonies and protectorates had long gone independent. His research revealed that the British Empire still included 200 named islands of any size (and thousands of smaller ones), that according to the 1981 census 5,248,728 people were citizens of the Crown colonies (5,120,000 in Hong Kong, 128,000 in the remaining 15 possessions). Winchester resolved to visit each colonial possession that had a permanent population, a trip that took three years, in which he covered some 100,000 miles. <br /> Winchester visited the remote British Indian Ocean Territory (or BIOT), thousands of miles from the mainland. The territory, made up pretty much of the Chagos Islands, was at one time home to over 2,000 islanders (more than the population of the Falkland Islands), earning their livelihood from a French-run copra and coconut oil company and possessing schools, churches, roads, and the inhabitants having lived there for generations. In the saddest part of the book, Winchester described how the islanders were all more or less deported to Mauritius, 1,800 miles from their former home, even though they were under supposedly British protection, all in the interests of establishing an American military base in Diego Garcia (sometimes called either the Footprint of Freedom due to the island's vaguely foot-shaped appearance, or the Rock by those posted there who hate its isolation). <br /> Winchester visited several remote South Atlantic islands. Tristan da Cunha, 1,800 miles southwest of Cape Town, was a fascinating place, very difficult to reach or even get onto owing to rough seas, weather, and no real harbor. The island essentially one massive volcano (which erupted in 1961, forcing the islanders to temporarily retreat to the UK), in its isolation has produced a unique group of people, all comprised of just seven family names, these Tristinians speaking a unique dialect of English. Ascension Island was he writes once officially dubbed HMS Ascension and treated bureaucratically as a ship! Originally annexed as a place for a transatlantic cable station, today it serves as an electronic listening post and military base, largely for the Americans. St. Helena is an island inhabited by a proud but kind people (\\"Saints\\" to outsiders, \\"Yamstocks\\" to each other), their language a mixture of various dialects and somewhat akin to what one might find in Dickens novel. Famous as the final place of exile for Napoleon Bonaparte, it has served as a prison for others, including the Chief of the Zulus and many Boers; now the islanders feel imprisoned by their remoteness from the outside world, a problem exacerbated by the lack of an airport. The Falkland Islands of course get attention in the book, Winchester having visited the islands on the eve of the Falkland Islands War and even served some time in prison in Argentina. <br /> Winchester visited the five colonies of the Caribbean, with a far nicer climate and less remote but perhaps not any better off than the South Atlantic territories. The Turks and Caicos Islands - two distinct archipelagos- are the third largest inhabited colonial possession (after the Falklands and the BIOT), the Turks deriving their name from a local fez-like red cactus, the Turk's head, the Caicos derived from the word cay. The Turks were once major exporters of salt, though have fallen on hard times since losing that industry to a Bahamian factory. The British Virgin Islands (more properly simply the Virgin Islands) he visited as well, a slower paced - and poorer - counterpart to the U.S. Virgin Islands. Anguilla we find was subject to a massive invasion in 1969 - Operation Sheepskin - that involved two Royal Navy frigates and over 300 soldiers, all in an attempt to put down what was feared a rebellion by the 6,000 islanders. Instead it was a miscommunication, there was no rebellion, and not a shot was fired, much to British embarrassment. Britain's newest inhabited colony, choosing to remain with the UK when St. Kitts became independent, Anguilla demonstrates that some colonies are not yet ready to go independent, or maybe never will. Montserrat we find is another volcanic island, one that just missed out on being the only Irish colony in the Caribbean! Finally we visit the Cayman Islands, the most famous of the British possessions in the Caribbean, home to an (in)famous offshore banking industry, and not much else.<br /> Winchester visited also Gibraltar, Bermuda, and Hong Kong, but decided against visiting Pitcairn Island. <br /> So what states does Winchester find the British Empire in his grand tour? Not in a very good one unfortunately. He finds the colonies an \\"unhappy collection of peoples and places, wanting in imagination,...policy,...a future,...money,...sympathetic administration,... [and]...talented leaders.\\" London he wrote didn't seem to care that drug money was being laundered in the Cayman Islands, or that the Turks and Caicos Islands were a transshipment point for drugs from South America. Several colonies had - at the encouragement of London - developed in the past one-crop economies, and when they failed those colonies - whether it was salt in the Turks and Caicos Islands, flax in St. Helena, or the dockyard in Gibraltar - faced bleak economic futures. None of this was aided by the fact that Whitehall seemed quite begrudging of monetary aid and quite slow to respond to any requests made by the colonial administrations.<br /> Winchester felt though that a more grave injustice was done by the passing of the British Nationality Act in 1981, whereby only those who lived in the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar were full British citizens, able to come and go to the Great Britain as they please and even settle there if they liked. The remainder of the colonists cannot settle in the UK proper with such ease, and for all intents and purposes are aliens in that respect. <br /> This book was both entertaining and somber.	2003-07-01

Kaplan. He finds that the old lines between East and West, even after the official demise of the Iron Curtain, still exist; on one side lands influenced by the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, on the other, beginning with Romania, lands not part of that heritage, instead heirs to Byzantine and Ottoman history. He calls this region, which is east of the European Union and NATO and south of Russia the \\"New Near East,\\" and in this book he sought to explore it. <br /> The book begins as a sequel to his _Balkan Ghosts_.  He finds that Hungary has a booming economy, the economic gulf between it and Romania widening as foreign investment in Hungary is six times that what Romania has received, understandable given the complex and risky Romanian business climate. He fears that Romania is drifting into the Third World with squatter settlements, a low per capita income, and the consumer class restricted to a few districts of Bucharest. Its leaders desperate to \\"lock\\" Romania into Europe via entry into NATO, Romania is clearly at a crossroads.<br /> Bulgaria he finds is very worried about entry into NATO, and is desperate lest it be forgotten by the West; indeed, so desirous of any coverage that Bulgaria's head of state personally thanked Kaplan for writing about his country! Bulgaria also faces the problem posed by the rise of criminal elements, called \\"groupings,\\" that are an increasingly powerful element (one of the early groupings was unbelievably based around the Bulgarian Olympic wrestling team) and the threat of a subtle new imperialism from Russia, that of Russian organized crime, which threatens Bulgarian sovereignty in shadowy ways. <BR> <BR> His trip to the Middle East was spellbinding. Concerned that he wasn't getting the full picture of the region from the international media, he sought to \\"discover the obvious\\" in his travels to Turkey and \\"Greater Syria.\\" He writes that Turkey is a dynamic and fascinating country, one in which the economy was growing 7 percent a year and was forging its own strategic alliances independent of the US thanks to a growing relationship with Israel, which as Kaplan shows the two have a great deal in common. Few outside Turkey he writes appreciate the role of the military there - he called it the \\"deep state\\" - which sought to preserve the ideals of Kemal Ataturk's revolution, chiefly that the state be secular and to fight against such forces as ethnic separatism, an ideal that even Turkey's Islamists seem to have embraced, as they work within the system and are not terrorists.<br /> Syria he finds is not a true nationality, but rather a \\"hodgepodge\\" of several ethnic and religious groups at odds with one another, though as yet have not fought each other as the various groups in Lebanon had. Syria was an artificial creation of France and Britain following World War I, one with all the potent ional after the passing of the Assad regime to go the way of Yugoslavia, a land comprised of a northern region centered around Aleppo with historical links to Mosul and Baghdad, the Sunni Muslim heartland of Hama, Homs, and Damascus, and a south that is Druze and the west which is Alawite, both of which are Shiite. <br /> Syria, an austere country very similar to pre-1989 communist Europe is both dependent upon and dominant in Lebanon, an area historically part of Syria. Booming economically, seemingly having solved the violent struggles of the 1980s, Lebanon is controlled from Damascus; Lebanon is to Syria as Hong Kong is to China, essentially two systems, the smaller but more vibrant system existing only at the good will of the larger power.<br /> Jordan is another artificial state, an \\"accident of history,\\" a consolation prize to the British's World War I ally the emir Abdullah (ally of Lawrence of Arabia), a country that faces an uncertain future with water shortages and a rising Palestinian population, one which might one day combine with the urban Palestinians of the West Bank and overwhelm Jordan's \\"Bedouin monarchy.\\" <br /> After spending time in Israel Kaplan visits Georgia, a country the size of West Virginia with 5.6 million people, creator of one of the world's fourteen alphabets, a true dividing line between East and West, and divided along ethnic lines (particularly in South Ossetia in north-central Georgia). Once nearly destroyed after the Soviet Union by its democratically-elected president Zviad Gamsakhurdia during a time of anarchy and utter chaos, it was ironically saved by the former Soviet elite Eduard Shevardnadze, nothing unusual in the homeland of Stalin. <br /> Azerbaijan, like so much of the New Near East, is not a unified nation with an agreed upon national identity. Many Azeri are more loyal to a particular region, with for instance those in Gandzha in the dusty hinterlands feeling they have little in common with the oil boom town of Baku. Kaplan raises a cautionary note with regards to these divisions and the future of Azerbaijan, a land with vast future oil reserves in the Caspian Sea basin, growing corruption rivaling the worst third world nations, and one which is a subtle battleground between Turkey and Iran for influence. <br /> Kaplan also visits Turkmenistan and Armenia, which made for fascinating reading. <br /> If this book can be said to have a central them, it is twofold. One, the West's insistence on democracy in the New Near East is a fallacy; at stake is more often the very survival of these states, and it is more important to have good leadership than elections, which can lead to democratic governments that do terrible things, such as the ugly war over Nagorno-Karabakh between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Two, the process whereby huge, multiethnic empires become smaller, uniethnic states is often a violent one, which has lead to much bloodshed in the region - such as with the Armenian Genocide - and will lead to it again in the future. This book should be on everyone'sreading list	2003-06-23
US	52590451	RWY3TDOFCZ53J	0679749810	806639526	Balkan Ghosts: A Journey Through History	Books	5	22	26	N	N	first rate book of Balkan history and travel	This was a fantastic book, a wonderful blend of history and travel writing. Reading it I learned a great deal about the Balkans, particularly the lands of the former Yugoslavia as well as Romania, Bulgaria, and Greece. <BR> <BR>One of the best aspects of the book was how Robert D. Kaplan tied together some unifying characteristics of the Balkan states, bringing some order, at least conceptually, to a rather chaotic region. I loved how he wrote that whatever has happened in any trouble spot in the Middle East happened in the Balkans first; for instance they produced the first terrorists of the 20th century (the IMRO or Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization). Before there were radical Muslim clerics in the headlines there were radical Orthodox clergy in the Balkans. The dispossessed Palestinians throughout the Middle East were preceded in the early decades of the 20th century by the huge number of Macedonian refugees in Sofia, Bulgaria, the result of the Second Balkan War in 1913.  Even the Palestinian Intifada had its predecessor in the Albanian intifada in Serbia beginning in the early 1980s. <br />One defining aspect of the various Balkan nations that Kaplan noted was that each one desires that its borders revert to where they were at the exact time of its zenith. This was especially clear in the case of Macedonia; many Greeks believe it is theirs since that was where Alexander the Great hailed from; the Bulgarians had it in the 10th and 13th centuries; it was part of the Serbian empire in the 14th century. As he puts it, the principal sickness of the Balkans is \\"conflicting dreams of lost imperial glory.\\" <br />This book has often been cited for its excellent coverage of the former Yugoslavia, and rightly so, showing a very diverse land, states so diverse today it is hard to believe they were ever united, countries at times mired in past glories and horrors. In Croatia the debate over the World War II legacy of Cardinal Aloysisu Stepinac serves as the primary symbol of the Serb-Croat conflict. Kaplan vividly contrasts Croatia, which is a fairly western, urbane, and ethnically uniform nation, with Bosnia, a \\"morass\\" of ethnically mixed mountain villages, \\"rural, isolated, and full of suspicions and hatreds.\\" He writes that Serbia, almost from its inception in the 12th century, was among the most civilized states in Europe at the time; in the 14th century an empire so powerful that it challenged the Byzantine Empire itself. Indeed Constantinople was so desperate to fight off the advances of King Stefan Dushan that they invited Turkish armies into Europe, which eventually defeated the Serbians at arguably the defining battle of Balkan history, at Kosovo Polje, the Field of Black Birds, in 1389, destroying the Serbian kingdom and creating a legacy of hatred and revenge from that battle that would continue till today. <br />I thought his chapters on Romania even better, a nation through which he traveled extensively. He vividly showed that Romania in the past and to a large degree today is a land where one's survival was paramount - understandable in a nation invaded and ruled by so many - where prostitution, informing on others, and black marketeering were commonplace, so much so that Tsar Nicholas II sneered that being Romanian was not a nationality but a profession. This has been true both on an individual level and on a national level, as Romanian history has been one desperate deal after another to stave off doom. Romania he writes in some ways is an odd land, one caught between East and West; seemingly Slavic, its language Latinate, perhaps more similar to ancient Latin than modern Italian or Spanish, its culture a mixture of the Latin bent for melodrama and the Byzantine and Orthodox legacy of intrigue and mysticism. <br />His portrait of Bulgaria was also quite interesting, a country in the Cold War seemingly squarely under the thumb of Moscow but perhaps more independent than most satellite nations, careful to exercise its policies under the table and covertly, often at the expense of hated Turkey, even involving truly Byzantine plots such as the plan to assassinate the Pope. Kaplan writes that some of its people represent it being dismissed as a mere Communist backwater, as it was once a powerful empire in the 9th and 10th centuries, the first of all Slav peoples to embrace Orthodox Christianity, and it was from Bulgaria that the monks Cyril and Methodius spread the Cyrillic alphabet to Russia and elsewhere, making it the birthplace of Slavonic languages and culture. <br />Kaplan includes Greece as part of the Balkans, even though many he writes do not regard it as such. Having lived at the time of the writing seven years in Greece, he saw first hand that Greece at times was only superficially a Mediterranean and Western country. Just as in other Balkan countries, there are those in Greece who rage about the fate of lands that were once theirs and of Greek minorities abroad. Though Greece produced the first humanistic culture and art, one that glorified the individual rather than the ruler, Westerners often mistakenly believe that this is the defining characteristic of Greece, rather than seeing it as a battleground between East and West on the very fringes of Europe, and fail to take into account later Greek history as much modern Greek thought owes more to Byzantine and Ottoman legacies rather than to Classical times. Much of Greek history and culture is symbolized by the divide between the Hellene, what the ancient Greeks called themselves, their roots in the West, relying on principle and logic, and the Romios, the Greeks of the Eastern Roman and later Byzantine Empires, relying on instinct, on the miracle working powers of icons, seeing Greece as outside Europe. <br />I have only scratched the surface of this riveting book here. I highly recommend it, one that really helped me see common threads both with modern events and the past and among the various Balkan countries.	2003-06-15

Wanting to have some sort of experience of what was it was like to visit such a distant goal in the past, as well as to tour Central Europe, he and two friends walk there! They journey on foot (only very rarely accepting short rides) from the northern Polish port city of Gdansk all the way through the rest of Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria into Turkey. An incredible journey, he describes it vividly, with worries about bandits, wolves, bears, the weather, hostile customs officials, dogs, and most of all finding food and a place to sleep at night. They meet an interesting and diverse group of people along the road, many of whom befriend them, taking them into their homes, sharing part of their lives with the travelers. <br />   Perhaps somewhat dated, published as it was in the early 1990s, Goodwin does provide an interesting portrait of Central Europe. The book spends quite a bit of time in Poland, a land shaped by the rise and fall of empires, shaped by the northern crusades of the Teutonic Knights, the Hanseatic League, of various powers that had over the centuries coveted and eventually gobbled sections or all of Poland, the broad flat plains of the country providing little obstacle to invading armies. Indeed Goodwin finds that the Poles often go to great pains to make it clear that they are distinctly Polish; though often that is simply making it clear that they are not German. As part of the country was once part of Germany, their concern is perhaps understandable.<br />   Though Goodwin's journey never takes him into Germany, he often encountered German cultural influence and odd outposts of Germans, even well into Romania. German settlers had been invited by many rulers in Central Europe, and for centuries German merchants, craftsmen, and guilds dominated town life, the towns in essence becoming German, the main language in Gdansk or Cracow or Buda German. Many of these Germans though Goodwin finds have left, those few remaining either thinking of leaving, stubbornly clinging to old ways in isolated Saxon settlements, or slowly assimilating with the larger majority. <br />    Hungary Goodwin finds is seemingly more stable and prosperous than the others he went through on his trip, particularly when contrasted with Romania. Though a third the size of Poland, its people took pride in regional names and differences, making the country seem larger than it was. One area that was interesting was Silvasvarod, noted for the famed Lippizaner horses it supplies to the Viennese Riding School. <BR> <BR>    Much of the book is spent in Romania, particularly in the region of Transylvania, an area once part of Hungary, its loss still keenly felt by many in Hungary as well as the substantial Hungarian minority in Transylvania itself. Goodwin found a number of people who held strong opinions on the matter, and it appears to remain a bone of contention with many. The only undisputed inhabitants of Transylvania are the once nomadic Szekely, Hungarian speakers, though not Hungarian. Famed for fighting on horseback, noted for their light cavalry even after they ended their nomadic ways, once proudly cherished by the Hungarians as defenders of the realm, they are still found in eastern Transylvania, a region known as Szekelyfold, where Goodwin observed their nearly pagan \\"totem poles\\" that marked graves and the massive palisade gates they erect at the entrance to their farms. <br />    Gypsies Goodwin found played a major role in the life and economy of Central Europe, particularly in Romania. Sometimes feared (many warned Goodwin that they were thieves and cutthroats), sometimes hated (they were very poorly treated by Ceausescu in Romania), sometimes even admired (Goodwin did find some who pointed out that they fulfilled a vital economic function in many areas), he found them more diverse and interesting than he imagined, a people who are not tied down to cities and have more in common with their ancestral Indian homeland than Europe. <br />    Goodwin did not like Romania, feeling it more like the Third World than Europe. He found it a land that had suffered greatly under Ceausescu, his legacy still looming large in everyday life. Romania seemed alone in Central Europe in lagging behind economically and in pursuing democracy, even in basic services. Goodwin visited an orphanage in Romania, making for heartbreaking reading, children barely cared for, virtually unable to speak as they haven't had enough human contact, having to be shown how to play with toys! What disgusted Goodwin the most though was the \\"gang mentality of ordinary Romanians,\\" how the days of mob rule from the past still existed, present everywhere from the unfriendly \\"leering beer-garden swillers\\" that were present in many Romanian bars to the rioting peasant farmers that had recently fought ugly street battles in Tirgu Mures. When leaving Romania, Goodwin suffers from food poisoning, the poison of which he compares to his trip through the country, which had been administered \\"from the moment we crossed its border,\\" beginning in the border town of Oradea, where the \\"first black depression\\" settled upon him, abating only upon leaving. <br /> Goodwin was glad to enter Bulgaria, a land he found far different, a land perhaps of opposites. Country homes he found were often surrounded by trash, rather than extremely clean as they were often elsewhere in Central Europe, a holdover from traditions of not displaying wealth to Turkish overlords. In Bulgaria they nodded to show no, shook their heads to say yes, again legacies of confusing Ottoman rule perhaps. Drier and emptier than any of the previous lands, Goodwin was glad to enter it; clearly feeling his next stop was in Istanbul.<br /> If I had any complaint to offer about the book, it was that we never get to see Istanbul; the book is all about the journey, and really about Central Europe. Having said that though, it was still great to read.	2003-06-02

I definitely wish it had been longer, but as all of the book's proceeds go to charity (specifically CARE, a wonderful organization that spends its money wisely and helps those in impoverished countries help themselves), I don't really mind. <br />The book recounts his all too brief time in Africa (eight days), where he tours the east African nation of Kenya. He visits some of the areas in Kenya in the most need of CARE's help, such as the Nairobi slum of Kibera and the eastern refugee camp of Dadaab, filled with Somali exiles. It is quite sad to read about the horrible conditions many of these people face (wait till you read about what a flying toilet is), but heart warming to see that many are still hopeful and that all is not lost. It would seem that many of these people are good people; all they need is a chance. <br />...it was still fun to read and parts were hilarious. I enjoyed his early thoughts on Africa, such as the initial conversations with those who convinced him to go to Africa that except for the \\"diseases and the bandits and the railway from Nairobi to Mombasa, there's absolutely nothing to worry about\\"! I enjoyed reading about that railroad, which Bryson writes has a tradition of killing passengers and has even been named the Lunatic Express, though Bryson rode it without any serious mishap. Also lots of fun to read was his arrival in Nairobi; expecting the sunny little country town in \\"Out of Africa,\\" Bryson was amazed to instead find traffic, high rise buildings, bill boards - as he puts it, Omaha! His description of a harrowing single-engine plane ride was very funny as well.<br />A fun little book, one in you can read in an hour or two.	2003-05-29
US	52590451	R2K23NB3VS4ZCM	0864424590	135822767	The Olive Grove: Travels in Greece	Books	5	11	13	N	N	excellent travel book on Greece	This is a first rate travel book on Greece, covering some of the mainland and several interesting islands in the Aegean Sea. Author Katherine Kizilos, daughter of a man who emigrated from Greece to Australia, does not cover all of the country, but such is not her intention. She brings to life some of the various corners of Greece, and does so with wit, enthusiasm, and in an informative manner. <br />    She begins the book with visits to several islands. We travel to Syros, an island that is struggling but is still productive, with a declining though still active seaport. She takes us to Thira, the shattered island as she calls it, the ancient name now in use again, though in more recent times it was known as Santorini. Once part of the Minoan civilization, a cataclysmic volcanic eruption nearly destroyed the island around some 3500 years ago and may have been the source of the eventual extinction of the Minoans. The island's ruins boast many of the hallmarks of that great civilization, including multi-storied villas equipped with running water and flushing toilets. Now, it is filled with sweating, complaining tourists she writes, many of whom are not appreciative of the ancient ruins or even of the old ways of the islands, and has gone in part from an island of proud fishermen and farmers to one of shopkeepers and waiters dependent on tourism. We also visit Lesbos, most famous for being the island of Sappho, less so for the undeservedly obscure Theophrastus, who was renown in ancient times, esteemed by Aristotle; regrettably the island's more famous ancient artist overshadows him. The island is subject to periodic pilgrimages by lesbians, to the combined embarrassment and wonderment of some of the island's residents.  I would have liked that the spent more time on the island of Ikaria, but she was pressed for time. Not one of the \\"stony, sun-flooded\\" islands that dot the Aegean, instead it is rich and verdant, and for a time was an independent country, as it was the first northern Aegean island to free itself from Turkish rule. <br />    I really enjoyed her visit to Patmos, the so-called island of the apocalypse. It was on this island where St. John wrote the Book of Revelation, his \\"esoteric and doom-laden prophecy.\\" I loved how she compared it with Thira; in that island, the results of an apocalyptic upheaval are easily visible, yet on Patmos \\"the dark thread of apocalypse\\" was invisible, difficult to see, but perhaps more real. Kizilos visited the shrine where St. John was said to have written, yet was unable to get any sense of the man or his writings, instead encountering yet more tourists, oblivious to the deeper meanings of the cave where he worked, directionless hedonists, filled with \\"manic, purposeless haste.\\" <br />    I was surprised she made a trip to Istanbul, home to a small and declining Greek population. Caught in a perhaps an increasingly Muslim society, victims still of a past (though perhaps improving) Greece-Turkey rift, many stubbornly hang on in that ancient city, once capital of the Greek Byzantine Empire, and still home to the head of the Greek Orthodox Church. I enjoyed how she contrasted the Greeks who call Istanbul home to the non-Greeks who call Thrace in northeastern Greece their home. There we met Turks, Muslims who have been in Greece many generations and know no other home, as well as even a small community of Nubians, descended from servants of an Ottoman emperor and a group of nomads, the Sarakatsans, who had once grazed their flocks on the peaks of the Balkans, but now have largely abandoned those ways. Yet all of these people are part of Greece too, ethnic minorities that are not always accepted or understood by those in Athens but are all a part of Greece.<br />    A good portion of the book was spent in the towns of the Peloponnese near the Gulf of Corinth where her father grew up. It was here more than anywhere else in the book I got a sense of what it was like to live and grow up in Greece. Like most of the rest of Greece, it is a land of declining villages, as sons and daughters flee to busy Athens for jobs or even overseas. Olive groves grow weedy with brambles, grape vines are no longer tended, houses once inhabited for generations lie abandoned, in some areas only the scattered shepherds remain, particularly in the \\"cold and solitary country\\" of mountainous Peloponnese. Whereas there was once a complex relationship in families between the pethera, or mother-in-law, and her nifi, or daughter-in-law, the nifi made to do many tasks to prove her worth, sometimes the target of vented frustration from the pethera's days as a nifi, now the pethera are anxious to please the often well educated nifi, immensely pleased when she visits her mother-in-law's village from the busy and prosperous city. <br />   Vividly the author shows that Greece is a land struggling to cope with its past. Its people still sometimes obsess about the Greek-Turkish rift, even though the author makes apparent that is more of a problem for Greeks than for Turks. The country still struggles with the German occupation during World War II and the later civil war, smaller villages still bearing scars where neighbor turned against neighbor and whole families were betrayed over petty greivences. She provided the stories of several who were caught in both conflicts and they make for gripping reading.  <br />The country though is also trying to cope with the future, with declining rural populations, the rising importance of the tourist industry (some Greeks actually upset that all many foreigners ever want to see are old stone ruins), and even with Albanian refugees, disliked but needed as rural workers.  Kizilos, like many in Greece, is uncertain about the future, but I think she is ultimately hopeful, as the Greeks have more than anything else proven to be a resilient people	2003-05-28

In it, mammalogist Tim Flannery regales us with tales from his many years in New Guinea, searching for new species of mammals on the island, the second largest in the world. A difficult island to work in - highly mountainous; extremely few roads, most villages so isolated that they can only be reached by small planes flying to landing strips hacked out of the jungle; parts of it some of the rainiest spots on earth, some areas receiving 11 meters or more of rain a year; possessing many dangerous animals ranging from crocodiles to snakes to huge spiders; tropical diseases and parasites a real problem in many areas (including malaria and scrub typhus, from which Flannery almost died from when bit by an infected tick)  Flannery had his work cut out for them as he spent over two decades on the island, both in the eastern half, the independent nation of Papua New Guinea, and the western section, Irian Jaya, part of Indonesia.<br />    Flannery is a highly accomplished scientist, having discovered 16 new species of mammals in Melanesia, many of them in New Guinea. Many of these and others are described in the book, and make for fascinating reading. We meet the Black-tailed Giant-rat, the bite from its two centimeter long razor sharp incisors much feared by the inhabitants of the island. The Three-striped Dasyure, a vividly marked rat-sized marsupial predator, one of New Guinea's few mammals active during daylight hours. The Snow Mountains Robin, one of the rarest birds in the world, found in the high alpine regions of the Meren Glacier in Irian Jaya, one of the very few equatorial glaciers in the world. _Antechinus, a small carnivorous marsupial notable in that the male only lives for 11 months, existing only to breed. The diminutive, dingo-like New Guinea singing dog, which arrived in the islands some 2,000 years ago. The six o'clock cicada, a tremendously loud insect that received its name from its trill it emits roughly 6am and 6pm daily. The famous Birds of Paradise, breathtaking in their beauty, several species of which are extremely rare.  He also describes the Long-fingered Triok, a black and white skunk smelling possum with the fourth finger of each hand a great elongated probe for finding insect larvae; you never know what he is going to find next lurking in the barely explored misty peaks and dripping jungles of the island.<BR> <BR>    Three of the most remarkable animals are ones that Flannery discovered or in one case rediscovered. One is _Maokopia ronaldi_, an extinct marsupial herbivore that once dwelt in the high mountain forests. Panda-like in appearance, size, and probably habits, Flannery named this new genus and species from fossils he found in Irian Jaya. Bulmer's Fruit-bat, a bat though extinct for 12,000 years, the largest cave dwelling bat in the world, Flannery was elated to have found them alive in extremely rugged western Papua New Guinea. The one though that Flannery is the most proud of discovering was the Dingiso, a new species of tree-kangaroo he found in the alpine areas of Irian Jaya, a beautiful black and white animal, surprising tame, threatened but fortunately partially protected by native taboos against harming them. <br />    However, as remarkable as all of that is, one could argue that the real stars of this book are the people of New Guinea, particularly the indigenous Melanesian peoples that Flannery spends a great deal of time with and clearly loves. Much of his time researching in the field he was based out of the villages of such people as the Wopkaimin, the Telefol, and the Goilala where he became fast friends with many throughout the island, in both countries, viewing them not as savage barbarians, but as noble, often quite kind people, their older generation vast repositories of cultural and natural history lore. One of the most enjoyable aspects of the books were the many stories about life in those villages, some of the tales tragic, othersheartwarming, and many hilarious.  <br /> Particularly fascinating was what he wrote about the history of cannibalism on the island. Apparently it did exist in the not too distant past, actually in the living memory of some of the villagers he encountered. Though not an every day occurrence by any means, cannibalism was an important part of New Guinea life; indeed, one group Flannery spent some time with, the Miyanmin, were once avid raiders, and actually referred to the neighboring Atbalmin people as bokis es bilong miplea, which more or less translates into something like our refrigerator.  Though cannibalism is now a thing of the past, its effects are still felt he writes, as villages once got some of their population from raids of other villages, the adults of that village were consumed and the children raised as their own; now, that is no longer a source of new people for villages and some are facing some depopulation as a result.<br /> Flannery sounds several cautionary notes in his book. Several species of New Guinea mammals and birds are in serious danger of extinction from over hunting. Though New Guinea is still a land largely without roads, more and more appear all the time, opening up virgin lands for hunters, loggers, and miners. Indeed in Irian Jaya the latter two are devastating ever larger sections of the island; the massive Freeport mine, which exports over ten million dollars worth of minerals daily, has destroyed large sections of forest with waste mine tailings. <br /> He also worries about the future of the people, particularly in Irian Jaya. He believes that in an attempt to make that land more like the rest of Indonesia it is causing not only environmental damage but also cultural damage. Indeed there are concerns over human rights abuses in Irian Jaya, of dissidents disappearing, of remote villagers forced to wear modern clothing and abandon their pig eating culture by distant Muslim politicians, who often find native culture abhorrent.  <br /> Recommended.	2003-05-25

The travels described in the book may have begun as a search for what remains of the ancient empires that once existed, but became as much a discovery of what Africa is today, and what it will become.<br />    Authors Marq De Villiers and Sheila Hirtle divide the book (and the continent) into nine sections, each with its own distinct character and history. Part one looks at southeast Africa, highlights of which include a visit to the impressive stone ruins of Great Zimbabwe, ruins which produce a sound when one's ear is pressed against them, the source unknown. We are introduced to the Makuni or the \\"Living Stones\\" of Zambia, named not after the famous explorer and missionary but rather for the fact that a chief begins his duties by swallowing a small stone, which lodges in his gut and becomes an embodiment of his people. This region is also home to the colorful Maasai warriors, often noted by tourists in colorful red garb (so that people will want to photograph them), nomadic pastoralists that have been pushed out of the increasingly artificial wildlife sanctuaries of Ngorongoro and the Serengeti despite having lived there for many hundreds of years.<br />    Part two looks at the east coast of Africa, the lands of the Swahili speakers. Fabled east Africa, long a tropical coast skirted by (increasingly threatened) coral reefs and (disappearing) dhows, one can still find along it Lamu, near the Somali border, still an island of coral brick buildings and mosques dating back to the 14 century.  Even more famous is exotic Zanzibar, fabled island known to the ancients and part of Tanzania in name only, once a famous source of spices. <br />    The third section looks at southern Africa, a land largely shaped by the Zulus and the migrations they caused in the 1800s thanks to the tyrant Shaka Zulu. We read about mountainous Lesotho, well known for its conical hats, vigorous ponies, and blankets (called Victorians), a distinct national character that is only 150 years old, invented by arguably Africa's wiliest diplomat, Moshoeshoe the Great; and Swaziland, one of the last of the traditional African monarchies, famous for the Umhlanga or Reed Dance, where barely clad young maidens symbolically offer themselves to the king as brides. The enigmatic San or Bushmen of the Kalahari also receive attention.<br />    Part four looks at the ancient rain forest lands of the Kongo, long a source of slaves for the world and even well into the 20th century under the yoke of forced labor by France (in the Congo) and Belgium (in Zaire). It is a troubled region, but one of great contrasts; separated by the Stanley Pool of the mighty Congo River are two very different capital cities; Brazzaville of Congo the authors describe a sleepy and pleasant town, in vivid contrast to Kinshasa, capital of Zaire, a much larger, angrier, and dangerous city. Some of the most interesting passages in the book are in this section, particularly of his travels up the Congo River, in war torn Angola, and among the pygmies of Cameroon.<br />    The fifth section looks at the Gulf of Guinea, long fabled as the Gold Coast and dominated by the fierce Ashanti, bold enough to challenge the British Empire and almost win. Of particular interest are violent and overpopulated Nigeria; the country of Benin (growing more into a model of how Africa could be), whose ancient kingdom of Dahomey was once noted for \\"Amazon\\" warriors; Togo, where vodun (the African incarnation of Haitian voodoo) still reigns; Ghana, perhaps the most \\"Christian\\" of the west African nations and a robust democracy; and Liberia and Sierra Leone, whose prospects are gloomy indeed.<br />    Section six was quite interesting, examining the peoples and old empires of the Sahel, the grasslands bordering the southern Sahara, as well as the Sahara itself. Once dominated by a series of mighty empires, first Ghana for over 800 years, then Mali, the greatest perhaps of Sub-Saharan African empires, then nearly 400 years later the Songhai. Fabled Timbuktu is covered in this section, the desert city a center of Islamic learning from the 14th century on. The authors' coverage of Mali is especially interesting, notable for Mansa Musa, an African king so extravagantly wealthy he was well known in 14th century Europe after his pilgrimage to Mecca, and his predecessor, Abu Bakari II, the Voyager King, who actually sought to reach lands he believed to exist on the other side of the Atlantic, disappearing from history when he accompanied personally 2000 vessels for a perilous journey into the unknown. Also fascinating was coverage of the Tuareg or \\"Blue Men\\" of the Sahara, a fair-skinned desert nomad group where the men go veiled, not the women, and the Dogon tribe, cliff-dwellers in southern Mali that are neither Christian nor Muslim but have instead their own complex religion.<br />    The later sections of the book are somewhat shorter, but no less interesting. Part seven looks at the Maghreb and the Barbary Coast of North Africa, an area once controlled by the now extinct Carthage,  the land of the Berbers, the Bedouin, and the Moors, once dominated by the Almoravid and the Almohad civilizations, in part infused from the Andalucian culture of Islamic Spain. Part eight devotes some time to Egypt, which the authors maintain it is definitively a part of African civilization, and Ethiopia, a fascinating land of rock-hewn churches and according to some the home of the Ark of the Covenant, and once dominated by the powerful Axumite Empire. The book closes with the Great Rift, believed by paleontologists to be the true cradle of mankind, home to the enigmatic Chwezi or BaChwezi empire, the fabled Mountains of the Moon, and the horror that was Idi Amin in Uganda and is the conflict between the Tutsi and the Hutu in Rwanda and Burundi. <br />    A fantastic book!	2003-05-13

I had no idea of just how much treachery, deceit, betrayal, and bloodshed can be laid at the feet of many in the diamond industry over the years. Author Matthew Hart regales many such tales in this very well written and well researched book. We learn about switching, a common sort of theft, in which diamond sorters seek to replace a higher-value stone with a lower value which he or she has brought to work, done to take advantage of a universal practice, the control of diamond inventories often primarily by weight. More common though is outright theft, which takes place anywhere from the diamonds mines to the massive diamond sorting and sale houses in London, Antwerp, and Tel Aviv. The tales of diamonds that have been smuggled out of mines are particularly interested, which have been moved out in gas tanks, have been tapped into ears, even taken away by homing pigeons and hollow arrows fired over the fences that encircle the mines. It is a common belief in the diamond industry that if a person can touch a diamond he or she will try their best to steal it; Hart chronicles the often extraordinary lengths to which the industry seeks to keep them away from human hands.<br />  Unsavory actions often occur with diamonds even before they are found. Hart tells of prospectors who switch allegiances, finding potential diamond pipes in a particular region for one company, than going private or working for someone else when a mine is discovered (or in some cases being sold out by their employer once their use had ended). Several of these type practices were referred to in the author's excellent chapter on the rush for the diamonds of Canada's Arctic Barrens region, where prospectors often sought to claim lands ahead of other prospectors based on pure rumor, laid out false maps that were to be \\"found\\" and lead prospectors on wild goose chases, even acting out fake conversations in bars that were meant to be overhead, all to lead away the competition.<br />  All of this unfortunately pales in comparison to the sad state of affairs that is conflict diamonds, a horrible stain, almost a scarlet letter, on the industry, a problem De Beers and others are still tackling with. Conflict diamonds, products of such war-torn African nations as Angola, have gone from being a side product of such civil wars and revolutions, something used by one side or the other to finance their activities to the very reason such wars are fought in the first place. With thousands of Africans having died in the fighting over these diamonds, both solider and innocent civilian, the civilized nations of the world have been increasingly reluctant to have anything to do with these diamonds and sometimes diamonds in general. And as diamonds from one source are sometimes difficult to distinguish from those of another source, the whole industry has had to come to grips with finding and dealing with those who deal in conflict diamonds, lest governments and the consumer do it for them. The sections on conflict diamonds are gripping and worth the price of the book alone.<br />  In large part the book is the history the De Beers, a juggernaut of a cartel that for decades has controlled the sale, distribution, and price of diamonds worldwide. Hart chronicles the often Byzantine politics within De Beers and the industry as a whole, noting the rise and current possible decline of De Beers, which has within a decade went from a control of 80 percent of the rough market to around 50 percent. Increasingly sources outside the old cartel are offering alternatives to consumers and stiff competition to De Beers, which has been frustrated in attempts to control, discredit, or destroy such sources. They range from Russia, long uncomfortable with its partnership with De Beers and seeking its own way now; to Canada, rich with possibility in the newly discovered Arctic fields; to India, king of the small diamonds, specialists in producing huge volumes of affordable diamonds, able to polish to jewel-like quality diamonds once relegated to industrial use; to Australia, whose Argyle mine has produced a flood of diamonds, many of which are vital to the Indian diamond industry.<br />  Hart does not forget the beauty of diamonds, nor the skill of the diamond cutter. An entire chapter is spent on the art and science of diamond cutting, with the author detailing the process by which the magnificent Centenary diamond was cut, an impressive stone with 247 facets that took 3 years and specializing designed equipment to produce.<br />  I liked how throughout the book Hart introduced many arcane terms about the diamond industry, many of which I had never heard before, ranging from sightholders (diamond buyers with a good standing in the trade, invited by De Beers sales of rough or \\"sights\\" ten times a year at the Diamond Trading Company or DTC in London) to boxes (selling mixtures of rough put together by De Beers and sold to clients at a price set by De Beers) to gletzes (a word of Dutch origin, meaning a fracture in a diamond) to knots (places inside a diamond where the structure alters, where there different orientations in the planes of the crystal) to makes (if a stone is cut so that is a brilliant as it can possibly be, it said to be the best \\"make\\").<br />  This was a fascinating book; I highly recommend it to anyone.of affordable diamonds, able to polish to jewel-like quality diamonds once relegated to industrial use; to Australia, whose Argyle mine has produced a flood of diamonds, many of which are vital to the Indian diamond industry. <br />    Hart does not forget the beauty of diamonds, nor the skill of the diamond cutter.

US	52590451	R2VCQIZ07AEVR4	0802713572	308941940	Universal Foam: From Cappuccino to the Cosmos	Books	5	2	2	N	N	delightful, wide-ranging foray into science	This book was delightful, I learned so much from it. Sidney Perkowitz took a subject a seemingly laughable subject and made it fascinating.<br />    The first section lays down the basics of foam. There is far more than just three states of matter - solid, liquid, and gas - and foam is a important type of &quot;soft matter,&quot; a substance that is neither rigid like a solid nor completely free flowing like a liquid, and generally contains large amounts of a gas.  Perkowitz points out simple observable facts about foams, that in their simplest definitions they are generally bubbles of gas distributed throughout a liquid or a solid; that liquid foams tend to be white, are usually short-lived, and move differently than either a pure gas or a pure liquid; and that foams within solids usually start out as liquid foams. The geometry of the bubbles within foam is discussed as well, with reference to a set of universal laws, Plateau's rules, devised by the 19th-century Belgian physicist Joseph Antoine Ferdinand Plateau. Vital to an understanding of the physics and geometry of foam are knowledge of surface tension, the minimumizing principle, and surfactants (an acronym for surface-active agent), all of which Perkowitz discusses with clarity and precision. <br />    Chapter two goes into the tools used to examine foams. Over the years the methods of studying foam have ranged from cells made from transparent glass half an inch wide to much more complex methods such as diffusing-wave spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging with computer simulations playing a role of increasing importance. <br />    Next we get to examine edible foam, my favorite. Foam is found in a variety of foods, from mousse (French for &quot;foam&quot;) to meringue (which we learn was invented by the Swiss chef Gasparini in 1720 and named after his hometown of Meringen) to bread and beer, all of which are highly reliant upon foam in their formation. We find that the study of foam in a head of beer isa much a science as it is an art, which the brewing industry has done research into, determining what type of glass is the best and on the importance of the foam to beer drinkers. Even more research goes into the foam in crema, important to lovers of espresso. Perkowitz analyses the art and science of foam in cappuccino (where the type, brand, and temperature of the milk are critical), whipped cream (we learn that aerosol whipped creams are propelled by nitrous oxide or laughing gas), carbonated soft drinks (arising originally from drinks believed to have medicinal value), champagne, and that ultimate expression of edible foam, the soufflé (from the French verb souffler, which translates into &quot;to blow or to puff&quot;). <br />    The fourth chapter looks at practical foam, from cork to aerogel to shaving cream. We first look at natural foams that have daily value, such as pumice (foamy volcanic rock), sponges, and cork (where we learn why cork is both a great insulator against heat, why it is great in sound proofing, and why it has been used by wine producers for so long). Plastics, particularly foamed plastics, are analyzed in great detail, from their formation and chemistry to their many uses (and disposal of in landfills as well). Perkowitz looks at foamed plastic in everything from packing peanuts to Styrofoam cups to insulation for the space shuttle to bizarre furniture. Fascinating was his description of aerogel, so-called &quot;frozen smoke,&quot; a ghostly substance as much as 98 percent or more air, an ounce of which contains the area of several football fields. Difficult to manufacture, we learn about its uses particularly in the space program. Liquid foams are also discussed, from shaving cream (which shares some similarities to whipped cream) to foam used in fire-fighting or in oil drilling. Foamed metal, another high-tech product, is also looked at.<br />    Chapter five looks at &quot;living foam,&quot; foam that is found in the world of nature.He describes a single cell as resembling a fluid-filled bubble, which crowd together like foam to form the parts of complex organisms. An understanding of foam has been crucial in the study of cells, body tissues, cell division, and reproduction. Foam, in solid form, gives many bones both strength and light weight. Foams are quite common in animal reproduction and in parental behavior, from frogs to insects to fish to even quail. Foams are also important in medicine, from the days when carbonated water was thought to have value to today when they are important in ultrasound therapy, in birth control, and - negatively - in some ailments such as the bends and altitude sickness, which he writes &quot;has been called a disease of bubbles,&quot; as well as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and transmissible spongiform encephalopathy.<br />    Chapter six looks at foam in meteorology and geology, from pumice, which reveals important information on the subsurface geologic actions of the earth, to sea foam, an understanding of which is important in climatology and an accurate understanding of storms and waves. <br />    The book closes with a look at &quot;cosmic&quot; foam, which exists as part of the very bedrock of the universe in which we live, both at the level of the incredibly small and the incredibly huge. At the smallest possible level of analyses, at the quantum level of subatomic particles, the very space-time continuum is possibly made up of something known as quantum foam. Perkowitz brings into the discussion the research of Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and Max Planck among others. On the larger side of the equation foam describes in a startling way the distribution of galaxies throughout the universe. The very galaxies themselves appear to be distributed in a foam-like pattern, the universe a vast series of cosmic bubbles, the film of which is made up of galaxies which enclose a volume of space up to 200 million light-years that is virtually void of galaxies. This finding has profound implications for the origin of the universe and for the Big Bang.<br />    I highly recommend this book.	2003-04-28

North America, already one of the richest continents in the world in terms of biodiversity, is home now to many thousands of introduced plant and animal species.<br />    Some were brought in for a taste or touch of home, missed by European settlers in the strange wilds of North America. Some, such as the honey bee, also proved of later significant commercial importance, becoming so vital to agriculture and indeed everyday life - pollinating plants, providing wax and honey - that later there would be many who found it hard to believe that the honey bee was not native to North America. Others, such as the rock dove or pigeon, provided a mixed track record; as Todd puts it, noting how revered the dove is in Western literature and how hated the pigeon often is; that in essence,  &quot;the colonists brought doves to the New World and ended up surrounded by pigeons.&quot;  As much as the rock doves proved useful for food, for delivering messages (labeled by some in this regard according to Todd as &quot;gallant&quot; birds, praised in poetry and song), and as prized pets, they proved a huge problem in cities. Others, such as the European starling, proved downright pests. Brought over in a misguided attempt to introduce to the continent all the birds mentioned in the works of Shakespeare, it has spread throughout North America and become a plague like no other, pushing out native species from prime habitat and forming such large flocks in some areas as to present health hazards. <br />    Many introductions were accidental. When a canal was opened between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario in the 19th century, allowing goods from the Great Lakes and the interior of Canada and the United States to reach the sea via the St. Lawrence River (in a chapter she appropriately calls &quot;An Artificial Wedding&quot;), more than just ships plied these waters. The sea lamprey, long resident in Lake Ontario, had not been able to bypass Niagara Falls and enter the rest of the Great Lakes previously. Once present, Todd chronicles how the predator preyed upon the formerly vast schools of  fish in the Great Lakes, sending fishing stocks plummeting and completely reworking the entire ecology of the lakes. Another creature taking unfortunate advantage of mankind to enter a new habitat - in this case the Hawaiian Islands - was the mosquito. Once an island chain completely free from this pest, this insect entered the islands from the emptied dregs of ship's water barrels. Quickly becoming a pest not only to humans but also to birds, the mosquitoes nearly wiped out many of the archipelago's avian fauna by spreading bird pox and avian malaria. Todd also writes of a recent immigrant, the monk parakeet, which first started to appear in the wild in the late 1960s thanks largely to escaped pets. Becoming more widespread, the author shows the debate between the parakeet's champions and those that seek to eliminate the exotic, scared of it achieving pest status, who ask themselves is this species of bird going to be end up becoming the next starling? <br />        Other introductions were done to \\"improve\\" nature, primarily in the latter part of the 19th century.. The ring-necked pheasant from China was imported to improve the hunting, a bird  thought worthy of the sport hunter and more of a challenge than native game birds.  Similar motives were at work with the brown trout of Europe, a prized game fish that did much to foster the refinement and popularity of fly fishing in the United States (though their benefactor, Fred Mather, believed that they could provide a vital new source of food for the American people). With few concerns for the alien species' effects on native fishes the brown trout became by 1900 established in 38 states.  Reindeer, introduced in Alaska with epic ideas to provide the native peoples with animals to herd and with new means of transportation and methods to make money, proved a failure as expected results failed to materialize for many reasons as the book shows.<br />    Finally some introductions were simply done to make money. The story of the nutria, an imported marsh denizen of South America, is fascinating. Brought in to help meet demands for furs - in the days when fur farms were in their infancy and the wild fur-bearing animals becoming scarce - it degenerated from a promising project into get-rich-quick pyramid schemes (which even involved federal investigation) as the semi-valuable nutria pelts were hyped up to gullible buyers in a high-stakes game that penalized those who actually sought to take their pelts to market. Even native animals were moved about the country for such endeavors; the mountain goat, not native to the Olympic Mountains in Washington state, was brought in to try and improve tourism. The region was deemed good mountain goat country; indeed it was too good, with no predators and a variety of very rare and highly local alpine plants that were not able to withstand steady grazing by the agile animals, the mountain goat has proved an ecological disaster. <br />    Todd discusses in an almost short-story format these and many other animals, including a variety of insect pests. The book is well worth purchasing; my only compliant was that even more species could have been detailed.	2003-03-20
US	52590451	R1D5L2BNLFG5MI	1558213988	602935866	Beluga: A Farewell to Whales	Books	5	2	2	N	N	a must for whale lovers	\\"Beluga: A Farewell to Whales\\" is definitely one book I wish the title for was not so apt. In this work Pierre Beland does an amazing job in bringing to life a remarkable animal, the beluga whale, and in particular one population of this species, those that inhabit the immense St. Lawrence estuary in Canada. He also brings to life in a sad and sometimes sickening way the plight facing these animals, cetaceans that even though legally protected in the St. Lawrence since 1979 do not seem to be showing any signs of signifcant population increase.<br />Beland's book in part reads like the current popular medical and forensic autopsy shows, as the author, a dedicated and highly trained biologist, seeks to determine what is killing the whales of the St. Lawrence. Ready at a moment's notice - even on holidays, the dead of winter, or in the middle of the night - to retrieve whale corpses found ashore or adrift, Beland and his colleagues probe each whale carcass for the secrets of its life and its death. With dedication and skill worthy of a criminal forensic team they uncover the truth of each whale's demise, which are often untimely as young whales or even newborns are almost as common in his lab as much more mature adults. <br />What Beland finds is chilling. The whales appear to be dying from pollution, a case he boldy and definitely makes in this book. Examintion of the tissues from the deceased whales reveal staggering amounts of industrial and agricultural chemcials, including polychlorobiphenyls or PCBs, DDT, dieldrin, mirex, chloradane, and more. Even though some of these chemicals haven't been used in the region for decades, their use banned, they continue to wash into the St. Lawrence, a vast river system that drains almost the whole of the Great Lakes region.  Beland writes that beluga whale milk in the estuary has been found to contain as much as ten parts per million of PCBs and six parts per million of DDT; a lot considering fish containing fives times fewer PCBs are considered unfit for human consumption. Ships carrying waste with more than fifty milligrams of PCBs per kilogram (or fifty parts per million) require a special transit permit; sadly, the average male beluga roaming these waters already has that concentration of PCBs in his blubber by age nine. Without suprise, this massive concentration of pollution within the whale's bodies has lead to a host of ailments. St. Lawrence belugas boast the dubious honor of the highest incidence of cancer in any marine mammal, perhaps even a higher rate than that found in man. Beland discusses not only the cancer but also the other health problems that are affecting this population of whale's very survival.<br />Beland clearly is in love with the beluga, a beautiful white whale that he writes wears that \\"peculiar beluga smile,\\" a feature that gives the species \\"the look of an enigmatic wise man or, rather, of a happy imbelice.\\" Remarkable animals, the author spends a great deal of time discusses the biology and behavior of belugas, particularly in a very concise and fact-filled appendix. Among the most vocal of all whale species, their repertoire is more varied than that of dolphins and extremely complex. Highly social creatures, they may surpass dolphins in their potential for social communication. They also according to Beland clearly surpass dolphins in terms of their echolocation capability; in fact this ability is so sophisticated that the belugas have been held for many years by both the United States and the former Soviet Union for studies to aid in the development of sonar technology. Beland discusses this at some length, including the remarkable story of a beluga that escaped from such a facility in the Ukraine and ended up in of all places the Turkish coast, very far indeed from the species usual haunts. <br />The book is also valuable for its history of the interaction between the beluga whales and the people of the St. Lawrence. Hunted for centuries - from the daysof the earliest European settlers and by native peoples before that - Beland discusses the use of weir fisheries to trap whales and of the odd, bizarre, and cruel war fought against the beluga between 1928 and 1939 which even involved bombing the poor whales from the air! Also discussed is the history of the beluga in captivity, covering everything from the early futile attempts involving the likes of P.T. Barnum to today's more sophisiticated modern oceanairums, which although Beland has some misgivings about them, may play a vital role in trying to save the species. <br />Finally the book is a good one to get for those interested in the St. Lawrence estuary itself, an impressive body of water and ecosystem in its own right. As much a sea as a river, the St. Lawrence flows downstream only half the time, it main current reversed every six hours by the tide in a never ending war between the light brown river waters  flowing from the Great Lakes and the green salt water alive with seaweed and all matter of marine animals. Home to a variety of seabirds, fishes, crustaceans, molluscs, and four species of seals - many of which are more charaterstic of arctic climates and are not found as far south anywhere else in the world - even without belugas the river and its life are remarkable and need protection.	2003-03-05
US	52590451	R39E668GUT7FMH	0140076840	316158079	Field Days	Books	5	4	4	N	N	a delightful romp through a variety of topics, great fun	This delightful book, &quot;Field Days,&quot; perfectly fits its title. As author Roger B. Swaim writes in the introduction, field days means not only &quot;the sense of there being explorations and scientific investigations carried on outdoors,&quot; but also that it carries connotations of &quot;the sense of unfettered activity, extreme pleasure, delight, and enthusiasm.&quot; In this work Swaim explores a number of biology and natural history issues in his native New England - and often of the world at large - ranging with pleasure and enthusiam from one topic to another almost as a butterfly flitting about a sunny meadow. Much in the spirit of his book, I provide a small review sample of some of the chapters of his book.<br />&quot;Trackside&quot; explores an unusual topic, railroad flora. He writes that trains are often excellent dispersers of seeds, often resulting in many exotic and unusual plants being found along railroads. From alianthus to onions, sesame to cucumbers, snapdragons to petunias, castor bean from Africa to Dallis grass from South America, pears to apricots, all have been found along railroads, places traditionally thought of of as waste places. Swaim explores how these plants arrive in such an odd location, how they survive, and just marvels at the wonder of it, of how nature always finds a way. <br />&quot;Gypsy Moths&quot; explores one of the most hated denizens of the eastern United States, insect invaders that spread like a plague ever year to the chagrin of local residents, &quot;horrified by the thousands of dark, hairy caterpillars with their blue and red warts, horrified by the incessant leaf chewing, and revolted by the steady drizzle of caterpillar droppings from the branches overhead.&quot; Swaim explores the biology of these insects, their history in the United States, their effects on the local ecology, and of humanity's war against them. Even with these much maligned organisms Swaim finds interesting and enlightened things to say.<br />&quot;Guests at Work&quot; explores one of those uniquely New England pasttimes; making maple syrup. If you never knew how it was made and wanted to know this chapter is a treat, showing how even small residential plots have yielded rich syrup, from light amber Grade A syrup to molasses-dark Grade C. <br />Showing his enthusiasm for the natural world world knows no bounds, in &quot;The Ungracious Host&quot; Swaim explores a subject I don't see often discussed at least in my readings in popular natural history writings; lice. Exploring their biology, the different types of lice that afflict people,  their interaction with humans, and how people combat them, Swaim provided me with information I never knew! <br />There are of course many other subjects discussed in &quot;Field Days,&quot; from fungus to growing and harvesting cranberries to evergreens to pollen (and hay fever) to how animals and plants deal with the arrival of spring to issues of lake water quality...so many topics are discussed with humor, authority, and enthusiasm that there is something for everyone.	2003-02-19

In this work she focuses on her search for a new animal, officially unknown to science, the golden moon bear. Is it a color phase of a known bear, the normally black moon bear? Or perhaps a subspecies of it? Or even a new species altogether, the first new bear species to be described in almost a century? Accompanied by the gifted American biologist Dr. Gary J. Galbreath and Sun Hean, a young and promising Cambodian conservationist, they search throughout Southeast Asia for evidence and accounts of the elusive golden moon bear. Traveling all through Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand, from illegal back alley markets selling endangered species parts to remote forest reserves threatened by encroaching refugees, illegal logging, and poachers to charity-run wildlife rehabiliation centers to dwindling primitive hill tribes vanishing in the face of approaching civilization, their time-honored wisdom of the ways of the forest dying with them, their quest is a long, wild, and sometimes dangerous one. Montgomery and her companions must face all manner of possible threats, from unexploded ordinance from the Vietnam War (Laos being one of the most bombed nations in world history) to concealed land mines deep in the jungle (a legacy of the Khmer Rouge, having left thousands of mines in Cambodia which frequently claim lives and limbs to this day) to warring hill tribes, opium growers, poachers, huge leeches, jungle illnesses; it would seem only their passion and thirst for knowledge kept them going.<br />This book has been described as a mystery, and rightly so. As they proceed down tangled jungle trails and even more tangled urban ones, the mystery deepens. Is there only one possible new species of bear haunting the rain forests and mountains of Southeast Asia or are there more? Locals in various areas speak of other new bear species, not matching descriptions of the golden moon bear, telling Montgomery and the others of \\"horse bears,\\" \\"dog bears,\\" \\"pig bears,\\" and \\"man bears.\\" Others speak of \\"honey bears\\" or huge compleletly black mountain bears, lacking the distinct markings of moon bears. Are these local variants of the two species of bears known to live in Southeast Asia, the sun bear and the moon bear? Perhaps they are new populations of more distant bear species, such as the brown bear and the sloth bear? Or do they represent altogether new species? <BR>Not daunted by this but becoming even more enthusiastic they do their best to expand the frontiers of zoology and answer these questions.<br />The book focuses mainly on bears but other wildife is given some attention. Learn about the dholes, wild rare, red Asian dogs once venerated and protected by Laotian hill tribes. The Asian elephant, still revered by many in the region, particularly in Thailand; in Thai newspapers an elephant's age is always mentioned with his name, and honorific titles are bestowed, Pang for lady elephant, Pai for tuskers, and Sidor for tuskless males. The khting vor, an enigmatic animal first described in 1993, originally said to be a new type of wild ox, later a type of wild sheep or goat, an animal about which Montgomery makes some surprising revelations about.<br />However, more than the natural history of these animals Montgomery brings to readers their plight, that they are in danger of extinction. A rampant black market for animal parts, largely for medicinal purposes, threatens the very existence of some of Southeast Asia's more spectacular wildlife. Bears are captured and savagely and cruely harvested for their paws, made into soups which are more \\"powerful\\" if the animal is still alive when the paw is removed. Montgomery describes in heart-rending detail how animals are inhumanely abused and tortured in the region for the supposed exlirs and potions that they can produce, even when substitute are cheaply and easily avaiable through man-made sources. <br />Perhaps even worse than the market for animal parts is the simple extermination of animals for food. Montgomery describes nearly empty forests in Laos, where virtually every wild animal, from insect to civet to song bird to bat to bear and tiger are collected for the dinner table. Barrels full of smoked bats and empty caves, skewered songbirds and silent sunrises - and worse -are the result in a virtual wildlife holocaust.<br />As in other books by Sy Montgomery the book is a much a travelogue as a work of natural history. Particularly fascintating were her travels in remote, poorly known Laos, one of the most enigmatic nations in the world. A poor nation but rich in diversity - Laos posseses 240 ethnic groups and four ethnolinguistic families, ethnic minorities making up 70 percent of the population, and over 13,000 genetic varieties of rice are cultivated in the country, with only India, one hundred times the land area, having more - to me the book was worthwhile alone for educating me about this country. The book provides similiar interesting details on Cambodia and Thailand as well. <br />In closing I recommend this book highly. Does Montgomery get her bear(s)? Find out by reading the book. As often in science, the answers often lead to still more questions, and the book admitedly does not have a final, definitive answer on all the qestions raised. However, I think you will be greatly satisfied upon reading this great book.	2003-02-17
US	52590451	R2EUCYCYCVWFW5	068484558X	417942399	Journey of the Pink Dolphins: An Amazon Quest	Books	5	10	10	N	N	enchanting travelogue and work of natural history	I loved this book! Sy Montgomery is a talented writer, able to put you in exotic places with vivid descriptions, I almost felt I was in the Amazon. She really brought it to life, I look forward to reading another book of hers I have purchased, \\"Search for the Golden Moon Bear.\\"<br />The book focuses on the author's quest for the pink dolphin, but really it is a journey to find not one but two dolphins. I don't refer to the other species of dolphin that lives in the Amazon, the tucuxis (one which she also covers in the book), but for two sides of the same animal. On the one hand she searches for the pink dolphin, the bufeo in Spanish or boto in Portguese, a living animal of which little is known about in comparison with many other dolphin species. Living in the most massive river system on earth, one connnected to innumerable lakes in the rainy season, in waters often black as coffee and infested with caimans, piranha, stingrays, and electric eels, in often very remote regions to which there is no reliable transportation to, it is a difficult subject to study. An example of cetaceans from an earlier geologic era, primitive when compared to modern oceanic dolphins, the pink dolphins preserve something from an eariler era, a holdover in the modern world. Montgomery and her various companions in the book struggle to get good observations of the dolphins, to try and track them, to identify individuals, to observe their behavior. The author finds that even experts who have studied the bufeo for years are often perplexed by them. She has many successes, providing much interesting information on them and a fine series of color photographs of the often startingly pink dolphins. <br />Montgomery though is also questing for the Encante, the mystical shape-shifting dolphin that is very real to many of the peoples who live along the mighty Amazon. Believed to exist in fabulous cities beneath the surface of the river, the locals speak in conspiratorial tones about the dolphins' magic powers and often lust for attractive humans. The natives often worry that their wives, husbands, sons, and daughters will be stolen about by the fabulous Encante, and speak with awe and reverence about the dolphins. Montgomery continually quests for the natives' views of the Encante, for their \\"true\\" tales, and for how they protect themselves against their fantastic attention.<br />Montgomery doesn't exlusively focus on dolphins though. Her book in part is a vivid travelogue of Amazonia, bringing us to many exotic locations. We visit Manaus, the impossible Paris of the Amazon, home to an opera house right out of a fairy tale. Built upon the backs of native jungle peoples by rubber barons, today it is a squalid city trying to embrace change. She takes us to amazing Meeting of the Waters, where for miles two tributies of the Amazon, the black River Negro and the white Solimoes, flow side by side before forming the true Amazon River. We are taken to two different nature reserves, both with differing strategies, Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo and Mamiraua, where some of the rich life and deadly beauty of Amazonia is preserved against an uncertain future. Montgomery takes us to the impossibly clear waters and white sandy beaches of the Tapajos and Arapiuns Rivers, where she actually swims with the dolphins, something not possible elsewhere in the dark and piranha-infested rivers elsewhere. She undertakes a vision quest by taking the hallucigenic Ayahuasca or \\"Mother of the Vine,\\" something few Westerners have done (and for good reason). <br />Further, while the bufeo or boto is the star of the book, many other animals form a rich supporting cast. The odd hoatzin, a bird with claws, seemingly someting out of the Mesozoic. Electric eels, extremely common and suprisingly complex. Caimans, another seemingly prehistoric species. Amazonian manatees, gentle vegetarians that are much more intelligent than often given credit for. The weird side-necked turtle. All manner of insects, including ants. And more are given space.<br />Some have said that she rhapsodizes too much in the book, but I disagree. She has done her research, the book is filled with interviews with experts, and there is a nice bibliography at the end. She has skillfully combined hard science with poetry, and the effort is very worthwhile. I highly recommend it.	2003-02-04
US	52590451	RZSMMIIQ0UR7Z	0871137895	96115448	The Eternal Frontier: An Ecological History of North America and Its Peoples	Books	4	5	5	N	N	good but perhaps too broad overview of  North America	I rather enjoyed this book, though given its subject matter - discussing the evolutionary and ecological history of North America from the asteroid impact that closed the Mesozoic Era to today's environmental problems - it was perhaps a tad too sweeping. Epic, yes, grandly so, but sometimes I was frustrated that he didn't spend more time on a particular subject or idea that interested me. Arguably this was unavoidable given the 65 million years he sought to cover, but still I wished the book was even longer.<br />Having said that though, the book was quite wortwhile. Many aspects of the fauna and flora of North America were discussed. Quite a bit of space is devoted to mammalian evolution in the Cenozic, something that is hard to find in popular writings (I know, I have looked; there isn't much on the Cenozoic, particularly the Tertiary Period). Oreodonts, uintatheres, protoceratids, and one of my favorites _Teleoceras_ are all given attention. <br />Many interesting questions in North American evolution are raised and then answered. How did temperate forests come to be the dominant biome of most of eastern North America? What part did tree squirrels play in North American plant evolution? How did the bison become the vastly numerous species that thundered across the plains when the settlers arrived? Why did rhinos become extinct in North America? How did horses, at one time quite abundant on the continent (one fossil site in Florida he writes yielded no less than 9 co-existing fossil species), become extinct? Indeed, what happened to the Pleistocene megafauna in general, which included not only horses but mammoths, mastodons, ground sloths, camels, lions, cheetahs, and many other animals?<br />Though the book focuses on North America, by necessity other continents are discussed, logical given the many land bridges that connected North America at various times with Asia, Europe, and South America. I didn't know for instance about the great fauna interchange betweenNorth America and the then European island archipelago 55-46 million years ago, how the fauna of North America overwhelmed the archaic fauna of Europe, though some European animals did successfully colonize North America (Flannery writes that mockingbirds first evolved in the Eocene epoch, likely from starling migrants that arrived from Europe). He goes into more detail in the more well known Great Faunal Interchange between North and South America, where large numbers of species colonized new lands, as well the formation of Beringia in the Pleistocene, the great land bridge that brought over not only many Asian animals but also humans.<br />Though mammals seem to get much of the focus in the book, Flannery does discuss the arrival and/or evolution of birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and plants throughout the time period in focus in the book. I thought his sections on reptiles was particularly intersting, discussing those who survived the asteroid impact in the Gulf of Mexico and those who didn't for instance, as well as notes on the advent of rattlesnakes in North America. Plants are not neglected; his writings on the creosote bush I found unexpected and interesting as well, and as mentioned he spent quite a bit of time discussing the evoltution of arguably North America's most charasteristic biome, the temperate decidious forest.<br />Flannery by necessity discusses a fair amount of climatology, geology, and plate tectonics in \\"The Eternal Frontier\\" as well. Not to an overwhelming degree but enough to allow the reader to get \\"the big picture\\" and to see how these events relate to the continued evolution of life in North America.<br />As might be expected mankind is well covered in the book. Much time is spent on the arrival of the first Native Americas (he refers to them as Indians, acknowledging cultural traditions though noting the inaccuracy) as well as the evolution of the Folsom and Clovis cultures. The impact the native peoples had on North America is thefocus for Flannery, largely their probable role in the extinction of the North American megafauna of the Pleistocene but also their impact elsewhere.<br />Finally, and sadly, there is a considerable section on what Europeans have wrought in North America, from the extinction of the great auk to the slaughter of the buffalo to the ivory-billed woodpecker to vast deforestation...all chronicled. <br />All in all a good book with a nice section of color plates in the middle. A bit more detail in some sections would have been nice though, but perhaps that is not necessarily a fault.	2003-02-02
US	52590451	RYA3N90BR98XZ	073820174X	767657373	Civilization And The Limpet	Books	5	3	3	N	N	first rate, very engaging book on marine biology	I thoroughly enjoyed this book, a delightful tour of a variety of topics in marine biology. The author, Martin Wells, wrote with enthusiasm, humor, and authority on a wide range of subjects. Even better, not only do individual chapter essays focus on a particular animal or group of animals, as Wells often uses them to illustrate larger points in marine biology or biology in general (or often issues in conservation).<br />I can't list all the topics that Wells dives into in this short review, but I would like to mention a few of the ones I found the most interesting. In the chapter titled \\"Hot Fish,\\" he shows that simply considering mammals and birds as warm-blooded and other animals as cold-blooded is a gross oversimplification. Not only do not all mammals and birds maintain a constant high body temperature, but there are essentially warm-blooded fish! Several speices of tuna and sharks, the two groups having developed there \\"warm-bloodedness\\" quite independently, are both able to maintain muscular temperatures well above that of the seas in which they swim. Wells discusses not only how this is possible, but what effec this has on the life of the fish and the ecology of the ocean.<br />In \\"Diverse Divers,\\" he discusses the physiological adaptations needed to dive, as well as some of the afflictions suffered from go deep beneath the surface. Discussing not only the problems faced by humans when diving (including a somewhat uncomfortable but informative discussion of the bends), Wells analyses how other animals deal with the challenges of diving, particularly seals and whales.<br />\\"Buoyancy\\" is another fascinating chapter, where Wells discusses how animals are able to float. Seemingly a simple subject at first, it is a problem for marine life, tackled by a variety of solutions. Wells analyses everything from the pressurized swim bladders of fish to the huge oily livers of basking sharks to marine mammal blubber to alterations in the ionic content of body fluids (suchas in some types of squid) to the cuttlebones in cuttlefish to how the _Nautlius_ does it...I never knew there we so many ways to achieve buoyancy! <br />\\"Dolphins\\" is devoted to many people's favorite marine mammals, and was quite informative. One issue the authors explores is the well known large brains of cetaceans, particularly dolphins. Does that mean that they are most intelligent creatures in the sea, or does it mean maybe something else? Wells offers a theory as to why dolphins have such large brains, and it has to do with their echolocation. Fascinating.<br />Other chapters focus on the _Nautilus_, octopi, those marine organisms that attach to boats (such as barnacles), bioluminescence, the lugworm, and hermaphroditism in marine life, among other topics. A wonderful book, I highly recommend as it has something for everybody who likes the sea and marine life, from the most specatacular dolphins and whales to the lowest marine worms to the hated barnacle to dangerous sharks.	2003-02-02
US	52590451	R3NGZA90OKRNSP	1555911390	78097207	Mountains of the Heart: A Natural History of the Appalachians	Books	5	10	10	N	Y	truly excellent book on Appalachian natural history	Scott Weidensaul has produced with \\"Mountains of the Heart\\" one of the finest examples of popular natural history writing I have ever seen. Thorough and authoritative, yet an easy read and quite engaging, he tackles an immensense subject with enthusiasm and obvious experience. Discussing the geology, ecology, fauna, flora, and conservation of the entire Appalachian mountain chain from central Alabama to Belle Isle, Newfoundland, you will never find a better book on the subject.<br />In reading the book I have learned so much about the natural history of this great eastern wilderness. Unlike many other natural history books which discuss faraway, exotic lands like Antarctica, Thailand, the Amazon jungle, or the Australian Outback, Weidensaul makes an area where I live in fascinating, bringing to my attention a variety of things I never even suspected, making this book a unique treasure. An area I took for granted, had lost my sense of wonder about now seems new and interesting to me. I am sure those reading this review would be similarly enlightened.<br />No you say? Do you know why leaves change color in fall, and how? Or why some trees turn one colors while others don't? Do you know what effect this leaf change has on the animal community in forests (ever hear of foliar fruit flagging?)? Did you know that many Appalachian tree species can survive winter temperatures as low as 80 degrees below zero, far colder than the mountains ever get today? Do you know what tannin is, and why trees produce it, and what effects this has on the forest community? Weidensaul makes what to me was a fairly mundane subject, perhaps suitable for a grade school science book, fascinating and weird. Trees are rightly one of the stars in this book, as Weidensaul recounts the sad tale of the American chestnut, the plight of the Fraser fir, the role of oaks in modern forests (and the potential problems their predominance could cause), and the magnifence of the white pine among many other plants. <br />However, animals receive a great deal of attention in this book as well, as by no means it is only about botany. Almost an entire chapter is devoted to the awe-inspiring annual hawk migrations down the length of the Appalachians. The many unique and highly local species of the mountains salamander fauna, one of the richest in the world, are recounted in great detail. Another unique fauna, the mussel fauna, again one of the world's richest, is also discussed, a subject not much to the lay naturalist. Weidensaul discusses some of the chain's fauna winners - such as black bears, successfully co-exisiting with people in crowded Pennsylvania, moose, which are rebounding in the northern Appalachians, and the raven, formerly a bird of deep wilderness but that one that is increasingly adapting to disturbed habitat - and its losers as well - such as brook trout, a species in decline in all but the most pristine streams, the red wolf, long gone from most of the range and yet to be successfully reintroduced, and the passenger pigeon, once a the most common land bird in the world, thriving on the vast crop of acorns in the Appalachians, now extinct.<br />A truly excellent book with nice illustrations in it, this will please any lover of natural history.	2003-01-09
US	52590451	R2Y67QHDB5SHLP	0805040811	883097346	Lords of the Horizons: A History of the Ottoman Empire	Books	5	7	7	N	N	general overview of Ottoman history, culture, and customs	Jason Goodwin has not produced here an exhaustive history of the Ottoman Empire, detailing every Sultan, event, nor all aspects of this once mighty empire. Nor does he claim to. He does not produce the end-all, be-all book on the subject, but then again, he doesn't claim that this is the only volume you'll ever need on the subject. Readers looking for such are sure to be disappointed.<br />What he did produce is a book that highlights many aspects of the Ottoman Empire, its history, geography, culture, customs, and social mores. Much history is covered, from the days before the final fall of the Byzantine Empire into the early decades of the 20th century. Goodwin does a fairly good job covering large sections of Ottoman history, particularly with regards to Bayezit, Mehmet II, Suleyman the Magnificent, the numerous attempts to conquer Vienna and push into Europe, Barbarossa, the struggles the jannisaries had against modernization, the Crimean War, the Greek war of independence, Mehmet Ali...there is history here aplenty. Other periods or aspects of Ottoman history, such as the Young Turk movement, the Barbary pirates, or relations/actions against the Persians, are much less well-covered. <br />To me though the real reason to buy this book is its fascinating potrayal of what life was actually like in the Ottoman Empire, addressing issues of nationalities, of the economy, of science and techonology, of every day life. I believe that a lot of these details are lacking in other works on the Ottomans. Goodwin discusses Ottoman view of time for instance, of the empire's long refusal to make use of clocks and watches long after Europe and the Americas had embraced them, and then suddenly becoming perhaps worshipful of them, erecting great clock towers that stood \\"as a symbol of Ottoman reform, lonely as lighthouses in every Ottoman city.\\" Another sultan was known for his large collection of western timepieces, who \\"crammed his saloon with two hundred clocks, eighty of themgrandfather clocks,\\" setting Western visitors ill at ease.  Goodwin goes into some detail about the Ottoman guild system, especially prevalent in Constantinople, each guild with its own distinct dress. Whether carpenter or chalk-maker, mason or gravedigger, tavern keeper or baker, each guild had a distinctive dress which its members proudly wore. Goodwin also writes of endowments or vakif, acts of piety and charity enshrined in Islamic law, where people willed money to provide for public services in perpuity after their death, franging from maintaing bridges to maintaing hostels or hans to even feeding birds when there was snow on the ground. Goodwin even goes into some of the fauna of the empire, of the numerous dogs for instance that once roamed the streets of Constantinople, regarded by the Ottomans as unclean but accepted by them for \\"their prescence in the divine plan, recognized their habits, and never called strays.\\" Though perhaps negelecting some nationalities, Goodwin does discuss the customs, dress, habits, and relationship with the Ottoman government with such diverse nationalities as the Greeks, the Albanians, the Jews, and the Tartars. <br />More than just some of the quirks and local color of the Ottoman Empire Goodwin goes into considerable about several major aspects of Ottoman life, in particularly how their military was arranged, how they waged war, and one of the hallmarks of the empire, the recruitment, organization, and usage of the janissaries, the slave soldiers of the Ottomans, for centuries recruited from a \\"boy levy\\" on the subject Balkan peoples. Goodwin also details the nature of the Sultancy, is progression from strong ruler to one who merely reigned, in the beginning a strong and charismatic military and spiritual leader, in the end one often as not beholden to the mob, of progression from the law of the fraticide to the infamous Cage instead, and its effects on the nature and type of Sultans that governed the Ottoman Empire. <br />Afinal note I would like to make about the book is how it ties in the history of other regions of the world and how they either affected the Ottoman Empire or were affected by it. The massive influx for instance of cheap American silver by the Spanish into the Mediterranean caused massive inflation in the Ottoman Empire, which itself was based on a silver standard, one in which gold has less value than silver. As the Ottoman Empire slowly but surely conqured the archipelagoes of the Aegean and cut off most western trade in the eastern Mediterranean, how this lead to the decline of Venice and Genoa, in the latter's case pushing sailors that would have once made their fortunes in the Levant and perhaps the Black Sea to instead explore strange, new worlds. How the the threat of the Ottomans to Vienna and the heart of Europe in fact may have helped saved the Lutheran revolution and the Protestant reformation as a whole. And perhaps how in the end ultimately three of the greatest \\"superpowers\\" of the Renaissance - the Ottoman Empire, the Spanish, and the Venetians - succeeded together and ultimately failed together. <br />In the end this is a good book, in some ways an introduction, to the Ottoman Empire, a civilization that boldly sought to straddle both Europe and Asia, one that once threatened all of Europe and one that was more centuries, even well into its long and slow decline, a land often of peace and prosperity. Well worth reading.	2002-04-18

He tried to visit Lebanon but was unable to, and was warned off from visiting Algeria. He never seriously attempted to visit Libya. Vowing never to take a plane, he travels along the coast and to the various islands by train, bus, taxi, ferry and cruise ship (both luxurious such as the $1000 a day Seabourne to the more decrepit, workaday Turkish vessel Akdeniz). <br />Though Paul seems at time a romantic, quotting descriptions of places from epic poetry, the Illiad, or modern works of fiction, time and again he finds something different, and often that is a great deal more gritty, spent, or to use some of his massive vocabulary, enervated, melancholy, moribund, or lugubrious (I had to use a dictionary several times in reading it, but hey, I learned something). Though some of it comes off as depressing, some quite depressing, I wouldn't have it any other way; he tells it like it is, describing the places he really saw and the people he really met. Avoiding the tourist's Mediterranean, not wanting to just see ruins, castles, and pretty beaches, Paul shows us in this work how the people live, work, and play in the countries of this great \\"Inner Sea.\\" Expressing \\"traveller's guilt\\" at times for being a \\"voyeur,\\" Paul observed often times the sorrows, tragedies, and miseries, but also the joys and the friendliness, of the inhabitants of this part of the world.<br />Paul does not romantize any of the countries he sees. He describes in detail the desolate look of the Spanish seacoast in winter (Paul deliberately traveled in the toursit off season), of all the English-language signs, cheap hotels, billboards, shops selling cheap souvenirs, trailer parks, all waiting forlornly for the summer hordes of tourists, a vacation mecca that was more English than Spanish. He goes into considerable detail his efforts to understand the bloody spectacle that is the bullfight in Spain, talking to Spaniards everywhere and even attending a few (and watching some in smoky bars in Spain), but never develop a true comprehension (or liking) for it. He visits war-torn Slovenia and Croatia, sharing dirty hotels with desperate refugees, worried about snipers, harrassed by police at border checkpoints, looking at bullet and mortar holes in ancient structures. His time in Albania is surreal, a land of screaming and whining beggars, virtual starvation, a land that just recovered from one of the most xenophobic dicators in history, one that mandated everyone has his own bunker and not even own his own car - his description of Albania alone was worth the price of the book. Northern Cyprus he spent some time in, a ghost-town, a phantom nation, one that doesn't exist except in a legal limbo, cut-off from the rest of the island by the Green Line, forever a truncated failure of a country, in reality an expensive Turkish colony. He referred to Greece as \\"the ragged edge of Europe,\\" a poor country that was basically a slightly better Albania as it were, a nation that was not really modern and an EC welfar state, and despite its rich cultural history, the people of that nation today - he writes - are not really truly aware of or part of the heritage of Aristotle, Pericles, and Archimedes. I could go on at length here, but suffice it to say his portraits of each country are fascinating. Some are a bit brief; he doesn't spend that much time in Slovenia for instance (not as much as he did in Croatia for example), and I got the impression in Morocco he was just glad his trip was finally ended. <br />The book is not perfect though. Some of the locations I thought he would spend more time on, specifically Jerusalem, Istanbul, and Venice, but perhaps if he did the book would be massive. At the very least in Istanbul there were political and terrorist problems, thus complicating his stay. All in all though I found this book quite worthwhile.	2002-04-02

In a highly readable and often highly amusing format he catalogues a &quot;who's who&quot; of &quot;invisible&quot; objects, organisms, ideas, and forces at work in every day life from allergens to burps, from carbon monoxide to dust, from gravity to mites, ozone to pheromones, quarks to wind. <br />Each entry gets a few paragraph to a few pages, often with intersting quotations from famous people on the subject, the history of the subject, and lots of other useful and often amusing information, though sometimes disquieting too. Did you know that some foods are &quot;hot,&quot; that they are naturally more radioactive than others (Brazil nuts, thanks to the gamma-ray rich soil they are grown in, are 14,000 times more radioactive than most other fruits)? Did you know that 10% of our body weight is made up of bacteria? That cigarette smoke contains 1% carbon monoxide by volume (10,000 parts per million)? That a single transatlantic flight will expose a person to so much cosmic rays as to equal a whole-mouth dental X-ray series? That prions, small subviral &quot;germs&quot;,&quot; &quot;can withstand boiling temperatures, X-rays, ultraviolet radiation, and sundry chemcial insults, like ten years in formaldehyde?&quot; Oh yeah. What a wonderful world. <br />Not all of it is scary stuff though, and much of the invisible world, including such subjects as quarks, neutrinos, photons, water vapor, comet tails, and krypton are quite harmless to humans. Learn such interesting facts that the pheromones of the silkworm's moth is so powerful that a male moth can detect as little as one trillionth of a millionth of a gram per one thousandth of a liter! That quarks, the most basic bit of matter that can exist, are &quot;point-particles,&quot; meaning they have no volume, and have a kind of charge, but negative or positive obut called &quot;color&quot; and having nothing to do with light! That of the four fundamentalforces - electromagnetic force, strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force, and gravity - gravity is arguably the weakest, yet unlike the others perhaps there is no known way to switch it off, shield from its effects, reverse, release it, or otherwise mess with it! Neat stuff. Maybe it IS a wonderful world after all. <br />All in all a fun and informative book, highly recommended.	2002-02-26

A great work of military fiction, the stars of this novel are those who serve on the &quot;small ships,&quot; the destroyers, frigates, and minesweepers that often do not get into the headlines, ships that perform vital duties in war and in peace for the US Navy. While aircraft carriers (as in the Stephen Coonts novels) or submarines (as in the Tom Clancy novels) are more often the star in works of fiction, the &quot;little guys&quot; finally get their due in this work. <br />As the title suggests, the novel is set in the Persian Gulf. Published in 1990 - prior to the Gulf War - in the novel the Cold War is still the paradigm in US defense thinking, the Iran-Iraq War still rages, and the &quot;tanker war&quot; continues as well, the US (and British) escort of American, Kuwaiti, and other countries tankers and other merchant vessels through a deadly gamut of island bases, deadly small boats called &quot;boghammers,&quot; aircraft, and mines. A narrow, shallow desert sea that winds its way through hostile, often warring countries, not allowing Americans basing rights for ships or aircraft, the seas too shallow for the great aircraft carriers or our mighty submarines, the task to protect one of the busiest and most important shipping lanes in the world falls clearly on the shoulder of destroyers, frigates, and minesweepers. As in real history, with the &quot;accidental&quot; firing of a missle on the USS Stark, the tragic downing of a commercial airline by the USS Vincennes, and most recenlty by the terrorist attack on the USS Cole, these ships are vulnerable, in the front line of what Poyer calls in the dedication &quot;...a strange war, a half-war, shadowy and constrained...in what we call peace - though it isn't.&quot;<br />More accurately, the focus of the book is primarily upon Lieutenant-Commander Dan Lenson, a star of previous Poyer novels, who serves as XO on the USS Turner Van Zandt. Hoping to have command of the ship when the captain is relieved due to illness, he instead finds himself serving a new captain, Benjamin Shaker, a man who lost his last command, the USS Louis Strong, to a missile fired from an unseen enemy. Sunk with the loss of many hands, many of the crew having died from fire damage from the missile strike, Shaker is determined that history will not repeat itself. Ordering changes in how the ship is run and even ordering torn out everything flammable, down to the crew's polyester uniforms, even against Navy regulations, Lenson obeys, but is unsure what is captain's ultimate intentions are, how far he should follow him, and how his past will affect how he operates. As the USS Turner Van Zandt continues to escort new convoys to and from Kuwait, protecting them from accidental and intential attack by Iraqi and much more often Iranian ships and aircraft, will this captain stay within established procedure for dealing with these threats, in a &quot;war&quot; that is waged under tight political constraints, or will he go beyond? What does Lenson really know about this captain, can he trust him? What unknown dangers lie in wait for the vulnerable convoy threadings its way down the deadly Gulf? <br />Poyer does a great job of illustrating several other charcters in the work, from aging reservist minesweeper divers to the hard-living helicopter aircrew of the ship to the drug-addicted but (mostly, sorta) trying to do well semi-stowaway corpsman, they add depth to the novel, their fates all intertwined in the end. His vivid descriptions of life abord the ship and sailing through the tropical desert sea are excellent. <br />Good book, I recommend it.	2001-10-17
US	52590451	RZGMZ2ZUZW904	0517378108	677137820	Complete Encyclopedia Of Battleships	Books	5	13	13	N	N	well-illustrated and thorough reference on battleships!	Tony Gibbons has produced an excellent reference work here on battleships, beginning with the first true ironclad, the French ship Gloire launched in 1860, through the present day, with the last battleships built the Soviet rocket crusiers of the Kirov class, lauched in 1980 and onwards (along with details on the Iowa class battleships, which served into the early 1990s). Every ironclad, predreadnought, dreadnought, and battle cruiser class from the Gloire on is detailed, with information provided on a variety of vital statistics, such as dimensions, machinery, armament, performance, and crew and details on the design, operational, and service history of the class. One of the ships of every class is illustrated in color, with key ships in battleship history - such as the Gloire, the HMS Warrior, the USS Maine, the HMS Dreadnought, the Scharnhosrt, and the Yamato for example - given double page spread illustrations and accompanied by photographs. <br />Gibbons introuduces the book with a general naval history as it relates to battleships, going all the way back to the great wooden ships-of-the-line and detailing key moments in battleship history such as the role of the predreadnoughts in empire building of the late 19th century, European naval armanents races prior to World War I, the great fleet actions of that war, the Washington Naval Conference, and the role battleships played in World War II. Developments in machinery and operational use are discussed as well as they occurred through history. <br />The various ship classes examined are divided into various chapters by era, generally each chapter covering a decade of history and opening with a detailed look at specific elements new in battleship design relating to guns, machinery, armor, etc, and ship use for those years, particularly against such emerging threats as torpedo boats, submarines, and aircraft. Battleships that later became converted to other types of ships (such as the Lexington class of American ships, planned as battle cruisers but completed as fleet carriers) or planed but never built (such as the American Montana class of battleships and the British Lion class)are discussed as well, shown both as originally plan and/or built and as they operated.<br />All in all a good reference work on a fascinating group of ships, particularly good in my opinion for its excellence coverage of ironclads and predreadnoughts, not as well covered in my opinion as some of the more famous battleships of the 20th century, particularly those that fought in World War II. Any true fan of battleships, battle cruisers, ironclads, and predreadnoughts would be thrilled to own this.	2001-10-16

Normally, I am not a big fan of Westerns, either novels or movies (or TV series or even really non-fiction works either), but I couldn't resist this book. This almost 400 page work details exhaustively any Western term, definition, piece of equipment, animal, plant, or slang you could ever want to have defined. <br />Some examples? Sure! Many slang terms are defined. Above my huckleberry means basically out of one's control. A granger was a settler or farmer, as opposed to a cattleman. A soiled dove is a prostitute. A grub pile is cooked food; a meal. A mockey is a wild mare. <br />Watts details more than fun to read slang though. He has some fairly extensive definitions as well. You learn that the term ghost town was probably never even used in the 19th century for instance. There is a nice map and defintion for cattle trail, showing the route of the Chisolm Trial, the Shreveport Trail, and others. There is more cattle and horse related terms than you ever imagine, from entries on castration to hot-bloods to peggers to under-bits. There is an extensive discussion of stampedes, particularly on how they relate to writers of fact and fiction. <br />Many defintions are accompanied by 19th century style illustrations or rarely photographs, often showing equipment such as pole fences, chuck wagons, soddies, and mantillas and animals and plants such as elks, prickly pears, heelers, grizzly bears, and burros. <br />So if you have even a slight interest in the Old West, rattle your hocks and get this book! It's a mother lode of terminology, fits for fans of the history of the Old West or of novels and movies set in it.	2001-10-16

In part, the book is fairly basic, addressing some basic topics such as what are continents, addressing if Columbus \\"discovered\\" America or not, what is a light year, and listing the world's largest seas for instance. Some commentators called the book remedial I see, and at times, yes, it can be. Many of the questions that are answered (the information in the book is generally presented as a particular question followed by several paragraphs to several pages of answers for each) can be high school or even middle school level (though not written at middle school level). <br />By and large though, I found the book a really neat read, covering a lot of topics. While it might have been nice if some questions were gone into in more depth, all in all the author, Kenneth C. Davis, is to be commended by his well-written answers to a variety of questions in world geography. To me, many topics that were addressed were not remedial at all. What do tides and tidal waves have to do with one another? Isn't Europe just part of Asia? Why is Australia a continent? Where was the Garden of Eden, or was there one? Why are there no deserts on the Equator? Why is the Black Sea called that? How did Africa come to be called the Dark Continent?  Are there Canaries in the Canary Islands? What the heck is a Hoosier? I don't know about you, but I wasn't able to answer all those questions, and I was intrigued to read the interesting and well-written answers to these questions. If want some fun light reading in geography and history, bone up on your trivia for the next time you watch Jeopardy! or play Trivial Pursuit, or just want to impress your familiy and friends, this book is one to get.	2001-10-10

Carrying on with his trend of introducing new characters and then following their exploits across many novels, this time we are treated to something different. Instead of Jack Ryan in the spotlight, we get two individuals that have grown in importance in the last few books, mainly since (and  primarily starting with) Clear and Present Danger; John Clark and Domingo Chavez. <br />The President in this book (Ryan, but never mentioned by name that I recall and not an important character) orders the creation of Rainbow, a multi-national (primarily NATO with some Israeli particpation) anti-terrorism task force. Based in the United Kingdom, the highly secretive organization is comprised of two teams, one always on duty, set to respond to hostage and terrorists activities anywhere on the world at a moment's notice. Clark is called up to be pretty much in charge of it, with Chavez as a right-hand man. Rainbow is formed and trained, comprising American, British, German, and other nationalities, and is ready for action.<br />They don't have to wait long as a series of terrorist and hostage situations occur in Europe, first in a bank in Swizterland, then in a private residence in Austria, and then again in a Disney-esque amusment park in Spain. What is the linkage, or is there one? Why the sudden rash of terrorism? Rainbow deals with each indicedent very effecitively, but is something larger at work here?<br />It isn't long before the reader finds that there is someone behind the attacks, at least some of them, though it is while before events become clear to the reader (and much longer to the characters in the novel, not only the members of Rainbow and the intelligence, military, and law enforcement communities that support them, but also in the guise of former KGB agent Colonel Dmitriy Arkadeyevich Popov, who works for the main antagonists in the book, but does not have the &quot;full story,&quot; at least at first).<br />The main villains, it is revealed, are members of a very secretive cadre of very hard core environmentalists, ones who are experimenting with biological warfare, with the goal of wiping out all humanity except for a elite few, ones who can properly &quot;appreciate&quot; the natural world. How this ties in with Popov, Rainbow, and the rash of terrorism is revealed, and it is chilling. Soon, the all of humanity is at stake here. <br />Some have criticized making environmental terrorists the key vilains in this epic novel. Some have said that this represents Mr. Clancy's views on protecting the environment. Personally, I thought the villain choice was unusual and interesting and made for a great story. He has already dealt with Irish and Arabic-Islamic terrorists, I think he was going for something that he (and others) had not explored previously. While I don't think he was condeming all environmentalists and conservationists, he clearly felt (my opinion here) that some are capable of such actions, and I don't think he is that off base. Not all terrorists and mass murderers come from Northern Ireland or the Middle East; one need only look at Jonestown Massacre, Oklahoma City Bombing, and the Heaven's Gate mass suicide. The scariest thing is that those in government might not see the next source of terror, one that might come from among its own members, and Clancy explores that with skill. Clancy does not discount all of the concerns of these very radical environmentalists, but he makes clear that their ultimate goal in this novel is postitvely ghastly.<br />A good book, a few flaws, but all in all highly enjoyable.	2001-10-03
US	52590451	R2NPAL053FXI1M	0688172016	561376189	Flash Point: A Novel	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Great action and eerie in its prescience!	This, the third novel by James W. Huston, was a highly enjoyable read, keeping me up late at night. The author, drawing upon his experience as an F-14 fighter pilot, writes an excellent and thrilling tale of modern warfare and Middle Eastern intrigue that seems... to be ripped from today's headlines. It is chilling how some of the sames issues facing the United States and its allies today are explored in this novel. Can the US declare war on one man and his organization? Though Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda are the not the adversaries in this novel, a similiar organization with roots dating back to the Crusades is, and it is not unlike the threat facing the world today in that it is a secretive organization that exists in more than one country and is not a nation-state. Simiarliy explored, how does a nation like the US combat such a terrorist organization? Can it use conventional means, can bombers, fighters, and missiles do the job? How does it handle the fact that the terrorists might be based on a country the US is not at war with, and while not officially harboring the terrorists, has no desire to aid the US in its efforts against them? What if in the effort to combat the terrorists the war widens to include countries that the terrorists are based in, such as in this work Lebanon, Syria, and Iran?<br />The book, aside from exploring weighty issues, is a great action-adventure novel of mititary fiction. Those who love to read about modern US aircraft carriers in action and their aircraft at war, particularly the famous F-14 Tomcat, will be thrilled by the very detailed and realistic descriptions of aerial operations, including extensive combat scenes. Like Tom Clancy, the CIA, Israeli intelligence services, and American special forces have a role in this work, and like previous Huston works there are some legal and political aspects to the novel, but the stars are the fighter pilots, those on the carrier who support them, and the aircraft themselves.<br />My onlycomplaint with the novel would probably be some of the characterization of the main character, F-14 pilot Lieutenant Sean Woods. Driven into obsession over the death of his best friend at the hands of terrorists in Israel, coupled with some aspects of Wood's personal history, he almost comes off as a nut of sorts, a conspiracy freak not unlike those who obsess over &quot;cover ups&quot; relating to such historical events as the Kennedy assasination. As the action unfolds and more information is brought to the reader, at least to me, his attitude became more understandable and in the end was not a problem for me, but I would like to note that some of his initial actions were a tad off-putting. I also kept in mind that whatever Woods thought, those around him didn't share those ideas necessarily, nor was Woods always right. <br />All in all a great read. If you like Tom Clancy or the previous two novels by Mr. Huston, you should love this work. I highly recommend it.	2001-10-02

Author James W. Huston, drawing skillfully both upon his military background as an F-14 fighter pilot in the US Navy and his legal background as a lawyer, has crafted a tightly woven yarn about terrorism in the South Pacific - Indonesia to be exact - and what the President and the US Congress do about it. <br />When terrorists capture the US flagged merchant ship Pacific Flyer, kill most of the crew, kidnap the captain, and then booby-trap the ship to kill potential rescuers, the world is stunned. Though the world expects President Manchester (a fictional president who serves after the President Clinton of this novel's timeline), to react, he does not order a military strike, instead announcing he is against continuing the &quot;cycle of violence&quot; and that while he will order a carrier battle fleet to help find the terrorist's island hideout, will not act militarily, instead seeing it as an internal Indonesian police matter. <br />Many are outraged as his reaction, none more so than Speaker of the House John Stanbridge. Furous over what he sees as a failure to act and accusing the President of pacifism, he tries to get around the President's orders regarding the terrorists, hidden on a foritified island which the battle group centered around the carrier USS Constitution under Admrial Billings locates.<br />Brash and brilliant aide to Standbridge, Jim Dillon, comes up with a little known provision in the US Constituion in Article I, Secton 8, relating to the power of the Congress to issues Letters of Marque and Reprisal. Researching it, he finds that the power was formerly used to grant legal authority to armed merchantmen in times of war, authorizing private ships to act as war ships. Instead, with Standbrige's support, it is proposed, voted on, and passed, the Letter instead issued to the Constitution battle group! <br />I won't comment much more on the course of the novel, other than to say it is great political thriller to see the constitutional crisis that comes to embroil all three branches of the federal government, and the struggle of Congress and the President to get the battle group to act how they see fit. It is also a great military thriller, to see a US carrier battle group, with fighters, attack craft, helicopters, and Marines operating against terrorists, a true joy to read particularly in the wake of the tragic and horrid attacks of September 11, 2001. <br />Highly recommend this work to all fans of military fiction, technothrillers, political thrillers, and fans of Tom Clancy.

Though readable on its own, to me the book is better if you have read Balance of Power.<br />Admiral Billings, having obeyed the Letter of Marque and Reprisal issued by Congress, largely thanks to Speaker of the House Standbrige and over the strenuos objections of President Manchester, and hand delivered by Speaker's aide Jim Dillon, successfully defeated the terrorists who attacked the Pacific Flyer killing all of the crew except for the captain, whom they kidnapped. These events closing out the Balance of Power, the beginning of Price of Power finds him under arrest upon his return to Pearl Harbor. The court marital, convened at the authority of the President, charges the Admiral for disobeying a direct order from the commander-in-chief and guilty of murder for those Americans who died in the attack.  <br />Meanwhile, some of the terrorists, including their leader who calls himself George Washington, we find had escaped and kidnapped the American head of a mining company in Indonesia and his wife. Also, those terrorists who were captured on the US Navy raid, returned with the USS Constitution back to Hawaii, may be released as there may be insufficient evidence to hold them for trial (this partially at the insistence of President Manchester). <br />Will Admiral Billings be court martaled and convicted, a pawn in the continuning struggle between President Manchester and Congress, particulary the Speaker of the House? Who will defend him? Will the terrorists be defeated? Will the hostages be rescued and the terrorists defeated once and for all, and who will give them the order to do so, Congress or the President?<br />A gripping thriller, though both a work of military fiction and great courtroom drama, to me the legal aspects of this novel somewhat outshine the military aspects. The court martial and brilliant defense of Admiral Billingswas riveting, keeping me up late at night, and it was fascinating to see the continuing struggles between President and the Congress, as impeachment proceedings under Standbridge's direction of Manchester occur. <br />The real hero of the book though, fascinating given all the high powered lawyers, politicans, and military leaders, is Jim Dillon, the aide to Standbridge and the originator of the idea for a Letter of Marque and Reprisal (see Balance of Power). A very likeable character, quick of wit and great at thinking on his feet, but not possessing all the answers and becoming sick of the political fighting, is the core character of the novel.<br />A fastastic novel, one of the best explorations of the &quot;fallout&quot; from a previous novel I have ever seen, in some ways is better than Balance of Power. I never thought I would be a fan of courtroom drama, but the trials scenes were so extraordinary that I just may give Grisham and others a try. An excellent work of miliary fiction, lots to keep Tom Clancy and technothriller fans happy, even Marchinko fans happy with the US Navy Seals, key players in this work! Highly recommended.	2001-10-02

Steadman, Steven Zousmer, and Lee M. Steadman have done an outstanding job on this book on Galapagos wildlife. The book is basically divided into two parts. The first part, amply illustrated by highly quality full color photographs, describes the overall geology, topography, climate, flora, and especially fauna of this important group of islands. Much of this stems from the fieldwork of David Steadman and his brother Lee. Truly fascinating, everything from paleonotological research in the islands, speciation of the island's famous finches, Charles Darwin's explorations and work in the islands, to conservation and more are addressed. Also found in part one are maps, both modern day and some early maps from when the island's were first being explored, as well some early scientific illustrations of the island's plants and animals.<br />Part two though to me is the main reason to buy this fine book, which contains the color plates by artist and scientist Lee M. Steadman. These excellent illustrations depict every resident species of bird from the islands as well as least one species of each major group of native reptiles and mammals. Even a few extinct species are illustrated. Accompanying each full page illustration of an animal in its native habitat is a full page description of the species, noting physical description in detail, ecological role, natural history notes, life habits, how the group got to the islands, possible relations to other species not only on other islands in the Galapagos but also on the mainland, and notes relating to conservation. The color plates are excellent, very true to life and quite beautiful, illustrating such species as the Galapagos Tortoise (of course!), the Marine Iguana, Red Bat, Galapagos Fur Seal, Galapagos Penguin, Dark-rumped Petrel, Flightless Cormorant, Lava Heron, and the San Cristobal Mockingbird. The famous finches of course are given several great pages of illustrations with several pages of text devoted to them.<br />This is a great buy, and it is a true shame that this book is out of print! I'll never understand why some books go out of print, this book is in my opinion a classic not only on the Galapagos but in the field of natural history in general, and should be reprinted again and again. I highly urged all of those interested in these wondrous isles to get Amazon to search for this book for you.	2001-03-25

With both a fact-filled and readable text and a wealth of excellent illustrations, it is a great resource for young and old. Though the main star of the book is the famous woolly mammoth, other mammoths are covered, such as the dwarf mammoths of Wrangel Island, the California Channel Islands, and of Malta and Sicily; the Columbian Mammoth; the Steppe Mammoth; and the ancestral mammoth, Mammuthus meridionalis. <br />All aspects of mammoths are covered, anything you could ever want to know about them (that is known to scientists I should say). Mammoth evolution is covered, with discussions and illustrations showing the relationship between the various types of mammoths as well as mastodons and elephants. The entire Proboscidean family tree is detailed, tracing back the evolution of the group to trunk-less Moerithierum over 40 million years ago. The history of mammoth discoveries in Siberia is discussed with many great illustrations, showing many of the famous finds such as the Beresovka Mammoth and baby mammoth Dima, both well preserved frozen mammoths. The mammoths (Columbian Mammoths) that were trapped in the infamous La Brea tar pits of modern Los Angeles are reviewed, with an illustration of a typical scene at the tar pits and discussion of paleontology there. All aspects of mammoth natural history are delved into; what they ate, what preyed upon them, how they aged, the nature of their hairy covering, what habitats they favored, along with detailed discussions of mammoth anatomy and physiology, even analysis of mammoth molars and how they chewed and electron microscope images of mammoth blood cells. Mammoths and human culture is well covered, with ample illustrations of cave paintings and carvings of mammoths, early man hunting and eating mammoths, mammoth bone tools, even mammoth bone huts! The final section of the book is devoted to mammoth extinction and the various causes, primarily climatic and human hunting. Also included are a useful glossary, an appendix discussing how what is known about mammoths came to light, several maps detailing mammoth finds around the world, and a bibliography. <br />Great popular science writing and lavishly illustrated, this all one could ever want on mammoths.	2001-03-11
US	52590451	R2QLY04XTZIIBX	0517321599	982194889	The World Atlas of Birds	Books	5	5	5	N	N	excellent sampler of the world's bird species	Scott and company have done an excellent job profiling some of the world's most fascinating bird species in an innovative format. The World Atlas of Birds is divided into sections based on zoogeographic realm (the Nearctic Realm or North America, the Ethiopian Realm or Africa, and so forth, including all the continents as well as islands and the world's oceans). Within each major &quot;continental section,&quot; there are further subdivisions based on habitat; for instance, in North America there are seperate page entries for the tundra, taiga and boreal forest, dry oak woodlands, chapparral, prairie grasslands, Everglades, and so forth, covering all major bird habitats, including urban and suburban. Within each page or two devoted to a particular habitat, two to around ten or so bird species are profiled, each illustrated and with several paragraphs devoted to range, taxonomy, ecological role, and other interesting natural history information. By no means are all bird species for a particular habitat listed or described, just a handful of interesting and representative birds.<br />The World Atlas of Birds is not a dry guidebook, but truly a show case of some of the more interesting bird species around the world, filled with neat information. Read how the Magpie Goose of Australia continues to confound ornithologists; is it a swan, goose, or duck, as it possesses traits of all three groups. Learn about Lichtenstein's Sandgrouse of the harsh deserts of Africa; to bring water back to chicks in the nest, the males soak their belly feathers in water and use them as a sponge to carry water back, sometimes as much as 15 to 20 times their weight in water. Discover the enormously successful Little Owl of Europe; though 90 percent of its diet is generally invertebrates, it can expand its diet to include small birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians, resulting in more than enough to eat and allowing as many as 20 breeding pairs to nest in as little as one square kilometer. Read about the Galapagos Hawk from the islands made famous by Darwin, tame enough to feed out of person's hand and known to hunt smaller birds like a falcon, catch insects like a nighjar in midflight, and feed on carrion like a vulture. Or the Poorwill of the American Southwest, one of the few birds which actually hibernate! Or the Oilbird of South America, a nocturnal cavedweller that hunts by echolocation at night!<br />In addition to profiles of fascinating birds from each region of the world, this book also has an introductory section discussing birds in general, such as their evolutionary history, feathers, how they fly, methods of landing, locomotion while on the ground, techniques of feeding, patterns of migration, courtship behavior and so forth, as well as a listing of some of the world's most endangered (or recently extinct) birds for the various continents and major island groups in the world. The book closes with a thorough multipage appendix, detailing every order and family of modern bird, including an illustration of a representative species, notes on habitat, nesting, feeding, food sources, social behavior, general physical characteristics for the group, range, and how many species comprise the order or family in question. <br />Truly this book is tremendous resource for anyone interested in birds, particulary the more fascinating facts about their life or about learning about birds from distant parts of the world. This book needs to be reprinted, it is too much a treasure not to.	2001-03-10
US	52590451	R31IRFVDH9F52A	0671799401	670905136	Prehistoric Life: The Rise of the Vertebrates	Books	5	3	3	N	N	truly outstanding book on all aspects of life on earth	This is a wonderful book, one of my five favorites when it comes to paleontology. Where to begin! First all, the book covers the entire history of life on earth, beginning with the origin of the earth itself, through the beginning of life, the advent of multicellular life, the bizarre Vendian fauna of the late Precambrian, through the now famous world of the Burgess Shale, into the explosion of life in the seas of the Cambrian, on into the debut of fishes, the conquering of land by plants, insects, and amphibians, to the development of reptiles, all the way through early mammals, dinosaurs, pterosaurs, the Cenozoic &quot;Age of Mammals,&quot; the Ice Ages, and early man. As I have pointed out in other reviews, too many books focus exclusively or mainly on dinosaurs, and David Norman deserves high credit for not negelecting other aspects of the development of life on earth.<br />Second, he is thorough in his coverage on most aspects of the paleonotological record. In his section on trilobites for instance, he has photographs of trilobite fossils and artists illustrations of trilobites swimming, molting, walking, curling up in defense, egg laying, and plowing the seabed for food. The accompanying text is no less detailed and useful. On the lengthy section of conquering the land, Norman has a great diagram showing the major structural changes that fishes underwent to conquer the terrestrial world (particularly in the areas of the pelvic and pectoral girdles and the spine), several illustrations of amphibian skeletons, and several nice illustrations of early amphibians, both individually and in the context of their environment. Dinosaurs as you might imagine get a huge section, with an entire additional chapter devoted the evolution of birds and dinosaur-bird relationships (including discussion of issues of dinosaur endothermy). Marine reptiles of the Mesozoic are not neglected, with many excellent illustrations including some very fine paintings, photographs of fossils, and a diagram illustrating the differences between the swimming and body styles of three main groups, ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and pliosaurs. The section on extinct mammals and mammalian evolution is quite thorough and one of my favorites, as extinct mammals are otherwise very poorly covered in the popular literature. In a readable and engaging format Norman discusses such varied topics in this area as the differences between birds and mammals with regards to the efficiency of their breathing systems, the evolutionary history of Australia's marsupials, the Great Faunal Interchange between North and South America, the evolution of whales, and the rise of grasslands and the role that played in mammalian evolution. <br />Third, the book, as you might gather, is richly illustrated. Though very much a great text one can sit down and read, it is packed with excellent photographs, drawings, and paintings of fossils, skeletons, animals and plants as they appeared in life, and prehistoric environments. Personal favorites include on pages 100-101 the early reptile Hylonmous scampering after a meal in a coal swamp, on pages 136-137 a scene of two Late Triassic pterosaurs fishing for a meal, and a Gigantopithecus family with associated fauna and flora on page 219. <br />Fourth (do you still need a reason to buy this book?) the book is very readable. Though quite accurate (though unfortunately one or two aspects of its coverage of the Burgess Shale and dinosaurs are a bit dated, hard to avoid), it is not a difficult read and one need not be a professional biologist. Relevant terms are well explained, often with the aid of diagrams and charts.	2001-03-09

Beginning in the present with deer and rabbits seen from his treestand, he goes further and further back in time, showing more and more exotic wildlife. Soon he shows pheasants, partrides, foxes, deer, and wild boars, as well as bringing us to early modern and medieval Holland. Eventually the work progresses all the way back to the Pleistocene, with wonderful illustrations of early man and such long vanished animals as Irish elk, woolly rhinos, and his crowning acheivement, the woolly mammoth.<br />Though the modern animals are well depicted, the main reason to buy this lavishly illustrated book are for its Ice Age fauna. In addition to extinct mammals, animals no longer found wild in the Netherlands such as wolves, horses, lions, bears, and elk are well covered as well. <br />This book is again extremely beautiful; many of the paintings have a very haunting quality. The way he takes you back in time really shows a unity of theme and makes the Ice Age fauna that much more real, showing they were as natural a part of the landscape as trees or rabbits, and look all the more real for being depicted in landscape still around today. <br />The book is not only on wildlife and landscape, as he shows a great deal of the life of peasants, farmers, fishermen, hunters, and eventually primitive early Man in Holland. He shows the building of ancient burial mounds, the dolmens. Poortvliet takes you on an Ice Age hunt for reindeer, then back to the village to show how the skins were prepared for clothing. He richly depicts a medieval hunt, complete with peasant drivers pressed into service, magnificent hounds, and the deadly last stand of the wild boar that was often the subject of the great hunt. A good number of pages are depicted to the interaction of wolves and humans in the Netherlands, showing wolf attacks and the campaign to wipe them out in response. <br />Sorry if I ramble in this review but there is just so much to take in with this magnificent work, it is like a concentrated blast of Dutch natural and human history, rich with wonderfully depicted landscapes, wildlife, human interest, and magnificent Ice Age fauna. Truly a rare book. A great book to get lost in, a great coffee table book, just a great book.	2001-03-08

A great resource, it exhaustively and authoritatively chronicles all known mammals preserved as fossils from that period of earth's history. In addition to the well known megafauna such as mammoths, mastodons, dire wolves, ground sloths, and giant bison, Kurten and Anderson detail animals nearly always ignored in popular works, such as rodents, bats, and insectivores. <br />The book begins with a thorough listing of all known sites of Blancan, Irvingtonian, and Rancholabrean faunas throught the United States and Canada, with each site sorted by state or province, its location noted on a map (and in detail in the text), and notes included on general nature of the site, species recovered there, and often notes on its general importance. Nice black and white illustrations of some of the faunas are interspersed in this section of the tome.<br />The bulk of the book though is the exhaustive listing of fossil mammals, each chapter organized around a particular order, and the chapter subdivided by family. Each species has common, alternate common, genus, species, and alternate (and no longer valid) genus and species names (such as in the case with the Jefferson's Mammoth, Mammuthus jeffersoni; it has also been called the Columbian Mammoth and the Imperial Mammoth, and seven other scientific names have been ascribed to it).<br />Entries vary in the detail to which the species is described, though many are given several paragraphs devoted to description, life habits, and speculation as to the reason for extinction. Black and white illustrations of fossils are included in each chapter, and a small number of extinct mammals are shown as how they appeared in life. Occasional maps illustrate sites of major finds. <br />Though not really a book one can sit down in a nice chair and read, it is interesting to flip through. Though more of a scholarly resource, it gives one pause to consider just how many mammals are no longer present on this continent. North America not only had the infamous &quot;sabretooth,&quot; the dire wolf, the mastodon, mammoths, tank-like glyptodonts, and the exotic ground sloth, but it once had scores of camels and llamas, a bewildering variety of horses, as well as giant beavers, yaks, cheetah, giant marmots, and possibly even pandas.	2001-03-07

Other creatures such as the giant squid and the pygmy elephant are poorly known and quite enigmatic, but nonetheless real and seem to fall between the shadowy border of &quot;standard&quot; zoology and cryptozoology. <br />Cryptzoology also as a field includes a host of other strange creatures, many famous such as the sasquatch (or Bigfoot), yeti (or Abomininable Snowman), and the Loch Ness Monster, others fairly obscure such as the waitoreke (an otter-like mammal that may exist in New Zealand), the marozi (the enigmatic spotted lion of East Africa), and the buru (a large unknown monitor lizard of the remote valleys in the Himalayas). To an educated person who prides himself on having read a great many nature and science books, many &quot;cryptids&quot; (animals of interest to cryptozoologists) seem outlandish and improbable, such as the skunk ape of Florida or even the Loch Ness Monster (as the loch in question has been combed over extensively, and any air-breathing monster would have long been discovered and documented). It is with the creatures that *just may* exist, that don't sound so improbable, that gives to me cryptozoology (and this book) its charm. Surely hairy wildmen don't haunt the rain forests of Washington state, but who is to say with absolute certainty the buru or the marozi don't exist? <br />Coleman and Clark cover the field well, with entries for famous and not-so-famous cryptids, as well as large animals that have come to light in the 20th century. In part, it is these newly discovered animals - the Komodo dragon in 1910, the coelacanth in 1938, the kouprey in 1961 - that help make the science of cryptzoology at least partially legitimate. In addition, they have entries for famous cryptzoologists such as Matthew A. Bille, a leader in cryptocetology (the study of hidden or undiscovered whales) and Bernard Heuvelmans, the &quot;Father of Cryptzoology,&quot; whose has written numerous works on cryptozoology, particularly on mysterious hominids such as the yeti. <br />Whether cryptozoology is a legitimate and cutting edge science or a collection of real animals, folktales, myths, and legends all mixed together is for the reader to decide. Coleman and Clark treat the subject with seriousness and professionalism, and the book is fun to browse through, complete with nice illustrations of cryptids and cryptozoologists. A nice bibliography is included, along with a list of cryptozoology musuems and exhibits, periodicals, and websites.	2001-03-05

Authors James Hanock and James Kushlan, along with illustrators Robert Gillmor and Peter Hayman have put together a simply gorgeous guide to all the world's species of herons, egrets, and bitterns. A guide to herons on every continent except Antarctica, all 60 species as recognized by the book, it is a thorough treatment of each one. Each species has a breathtaking color illustration, many times an additional black and white illustration, the common name, genus and species name, alternate common names, when and who first described it as species, maps illustrating range (including directions of migration and areas of casual occurrences), several paragraphs describing in detail their physical appearance, notes on their distribution and population, migration, habitat, behavior flying, feeding, and breeding, descriptions of nests, eggs, and young, and a note or two on taxonomy. Subspecies are noted as well; for instance a two page color range map depicts the 30 subspecies of the green-backed heron, found throught the Americas, Africa, Asia, Australia, and several Pacific and Indian Ocean island groups. <br />In addition to being a thorough field guide and collection of natural history notes on the world's herons, egrets, and bitterns the first section of the book contains useful articles on heron classification, courtship, feeding, and tips on identifying herons and egrets, including several color plates that aid in identifying the many white herons and egrets that live around the world. An extensive bibliography closes out this work.<br />Whether you want to read more about the great blue heron or the black-crowned night heron that lives around the local river or swamp, or something more exotic, like the black heron of Africa or the zigzag heron of South America, then this is the book for you. The book will also be of interest to conservationists, as several species such as the slaty egret have very restricted ranges (in this case known to breed only in the Okavango swamp in northwest Botswana) or very small populations such as Malagasy heron.	2001-03-05

Chronicling Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, French, and English activities in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, it is ambitious and epic in scope.<br />Sherry paints a picture of continual hardship on the part of these sailors on voyages of exploration, trade, and warfare. Political infighting and miserly sovereigns delayed missions for years, or so underfunded them that they were doomed to failure thanks to decreipt ships, wormy food, or otherwise poor supplies. Leaders of expeditions were often chosen by the rulers of the various nations not because of sailing skill or some personal or professional trait that made them outstanding explorers, but because they were owed favors, were the darlings of various kings, or simply because they bought their way on. Time and again sailing expeditions broke down into infighting and sometimes outright mutiny when supplies ran low, there were disputes over leadership of a ship or expedition, when winds were poor, and/or when a mythical island failed to appear, either because it never existed in the first place or because the ships were woefully off course. Petty treachery and arrogance often poisoned relations with peaceful natives throughout the Pacific, resulting in suffering on both sides and inevitable European massacres of Polynesians, Melanesians, and Micronesians, or sometimes vice versa. Other times fairly peaceful European explorers and merchants were meant with extremely hostile natives and slaughtered, perhaps the legacy of previous visits, or in some cases due to local xenophobia and warlike ways. If one wanted to die old, exploring the Pacific was not recommended.<br />Sherry does a great job discussing the continual struggles to just get to the Pacific, of one nation trying to reach this world's largest ocean and its coasts and islands and avoid areas of Spanish, English, or other national domination. Much of these efforts relate to events and schemes in the Strait of Magellan and Tierra Del Fuego, and make for interesting though sometimes sad reading.<br />Much of the later parts of the book concern the struggle for finding and laying claim to the mythical southern continent, long thought to exist. It was almost painful to read about expeditons that either just missed Australia, or saw Australia and failed to realize it was the continent they were seeking. It appeared even when some did realize what it was, it wasn't the legendary paradise they hoped it would be.<br />My only real complaint about the book is that after a while reading about how so miserably so many explorers and expeditions turned about, about explorers languishing in port for years due to lack of funds, of ships stranded at sea with dwindling food and water thanks to lack of sufficient winds, of continual conflicts with islanders, it almost got depressing. One certainly can't acccuse Sherry of needlessly romanticizing the exploration of the Pacific. Perhaps it is just me though, but I found some of the continual hardship a bit tedious.<br />Still, this is a very good history book, one well worth buying.ommended. <br />Sherry does a great job discussing the continual struggles to just get to the Pacific, of one nation trying to reach this world's largest ocean and its coasts and islands and avoid areas of Spanish, English, or other national domination.

What a gorgeous book. <br />With truly spectacular photographs and informative text they explore the misty rain forests of Borneo, home to thousands of species still new to science, domain of the orangutan, the rarely seen rhino, the secretive tarsier, flying frogs and flying snakes, and on Mount Kinabalu, the massive cloud-wreathed peak that dominates northern Borneo, over 3,000 orchid species, a full 10 percent of the world's total. Next they explore frigid and storm-ravaged South Georgia, &quot;one of a scattering of small islands that ring Antarctica like the moons of an icy planet.&quot; Here the two show us raucous penguin colonies, thousands of seals, graceful albatrosses, terns, petrels, and more that call this island at the end of the earth home. Then it is on to Hawaii, &quot;the farthest paradise.&quot; Born of fiery volcanoes, they are home to unqiue flora such as the 'ama'u fern, first to colonize after lava flows have cooled, and the magnificent silverswords, which breed at ten or fifteen years of age in breathtaking blossoms, and then perish. The animal life is no less impressive here, with thousands of endemic land snails, breathtaking birds such as the brilliant 'i'iwi or the wide-ranging blue-faced booby, and marine creatures such as the Hawaiian monk seal and the green sea turtle. Next they whisk you to Madagascar, a lost world that preserves some of the life from the days of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana, present during the time of the dinosaurs. This giant island, as this book shows, is home to scores of lemurs (including the playful ringtail and the nocturnal aye-aye), chameleons, bizarre baobab species, geckos, and more, all of which developed in isolation from the rest of the world. The last stop is Okavango, an African widlife paradise in the form of an inland delta and associated wetlands, all in the midst of the harsh Kalahari Desert. Here one can find the largest elephant herd on the planet as well as hippos, lechwes (a type of marsh-dwelling antelope), storks, crocodiles, frogs, flamingos, lions, and other manner of creature great and small.<br />The greatest thing about the book is obviously the photographs, but the accompanying text is wortwhile too. The text addresses issue of conservation, and provide many interesting facts and information. For instance the section on Madagascar discusses some of the fascinating extinct megafauna (such as elephant birds and giant lemurs) that once existed there. <br />A great book, a must for any nature lover or anyone who loves exotic destinations.	2001-03-04

One of the first major actions iniatiated by the United States following the North Korean invasion, it is a story of American forces being thrown back and surrounded by surging Chinese communist forces. US forces were for the most part woefully equipped and had not planned on the highly effective counterattack, and Russ chronicles many units that were cut off, surrounded, and annihilated. The US Army comes of as particularly ineffectual and poorly led, time and again failing to help its men and compounding bad situations.<br />The true heroes, and the main focus of the book, are the US Marines. Showing that truly every Marine is a rifleman, the book is very much the story of how Marine units, far from safety, fighting in brutal cold on harsh mountaintops, ill-supplied, had to fight their way to the sea and rescue. With combat in every direction they faced and the only real help generally coming from harried naval and Marine aviators who were unable to stay long in the area, they had no choice but to launch a fighting retreat. <br />Though the book has high praises for the Marines, it does not glamorize war. The fighting was harsh, and Russ does not hold back from describing everything from frostbite to battle wounds to crushed hopes to fields littered with corpses. The conflict was brutal and without quarter, and Russ does not flinch in detailing it. <br />While the book might be a bit harsh for some, it is a great depiction of heroism, courage, military skill, and just plain luck, one of the unsung chapters in American military history. Everyone should read this book.	2001-03-04

Most of the animal kingdom, and much of the biomass on the planet, are invertebrates! Insects, spiders, centipedes, molluscs, crustaceans, echnioderms, worms, all greatly outnumber vertebrates and are absolutely vital to continued life on earth, and all are greatly unappreciated by the average person. <br />Richard Conniff takes us on a representative tour of several members of the invertebrate world. Though he only scratches the surface, he shows us some of the most fascinating of the &quot;creepy crawlies,&quot; creatures that often have few admirers in the media or popular culture. From the fascinating world of flies to the invaluable leech to the hated fire ant to beetles, fleas, and giant squid and beyond, Conniff shows us the astounding world of invertebrates. <br />Strictly speaking, Conniff includes one vertebrate in the mix, the lowly but extremely unusual hagfish, so it is not only invertebrates. Having said that though this was an excellent book, one well worth reading. Popular science writing at its best.	2001-03-03

O'Toole does a very credible and noteworthy job discussing all aspects of the war, detailing not only the land and naval operations during the war, but the diplomatic events preceding the crisis and during it, and actions on the American political scene in Congress, the White House, and the press leading up to and during the conflict. O'Toole discusses as well previous events in relations between the United States, Cuba, and Spain, and how the US had a long involvement in Cuba long before 1898 running guns, smuggling, and otherwise aiding Cuban insurgents and rebels against Spanish authorities. The author shows that the Spanish-American War was practically inevitable given the past history of American involvement and views on the region, and was not out of the realm of possibility that war might have occured much earlier.<br />The Spanish-American War was in many ways a war between a declining Spain, increasingly weak in Europe, overextended, fighting a war it did not want over a possession that was increasingly more trouble than it was worth, and a rising United States, eager to flex its muscles after the long recovery from the Civil War, increasingly concerned with events outside it borders (the interest in part fueled by a very activist press), and an eager and enthusiastic Theodore Roosevelt building and running an increasingly world class navy. The Spanish-American War pretty much marks the debut of the US as a world power as it closed the war having defeated a major European power and with possessions far outside of traditional home waters.  <br />O'Toole shows in detail the conflicts on land and in the sea, and how truly different they were. The naval conflicts went exceedingly well for the United States thanks to excellent tactics and ships, and casualties were extremely light. O'Toole vividly shows how the Battle of Manila Bay and events in the Phillipines made Admiral Dewey a hero, as well as how Oregon's dash around the Horn made it a legend. The land battles stand in stark contrast, as they were beset by confused leadership at times, ill-preparation, difficult terrain, disease, and a desperate Spanish defense force. Casualties were much higher on land, and O'Toole shows how the fighting in the jungles and mountains of Cuba was far from &quot;splendid.&quot; <br />O'Toole closes the book with a look at the war in the Phillipines, which soon developed into the Phillipine Insurrection. Though he does not spend a great deal of time on this aspect of the war, he does draw some startlingly parallels between this theater of operations and the much later Vietnam War; a war fought in the jungle, where the enemy and the friend were difficult to tell apart, fought by often demoralized troops with hazy objectives, a conflict in which cruel tactics were employed by both sides, far more brutal than was seen in Cuba. <br />A great read, a must for military historians, students of Latin America, and of American history, as well as anyone wanting to know more about the &quot;splendid little war.&quot;	2001-03-03

Combining personal experience with solid entomological fact, Hubbell presents to the average reader fascinating glimpses of a number of invertebrate groups, such as water striders, dragonflies, daddy longlegs, and butterflies. Hubbell shows the life stories of these groups, the role they play in nature, and the people whose lives they affect. Whether beautiful or hideous, valuable or a pest, Hubbell shows them all to be fascinating creatures. Despite that many of them are quite common, some such as black flies too common, the authors show that mysteries still exist with these creatures, how sometimes relatively basic aspects of their lives and roles in nature are mysteries. <br />This book is very readable and while not too technical is filled with lots of interesting and accurate facts and a wealth of personal experience on the part of the author. If you ever wanted to know more about the butterflies in your garden, the dragonflies wizzing by you over the local lake or pond, or that daddy longlegs in the attic or toolshed, this is the book for you.	2001-03-03

Crisp high quality photographs of vertebrate fossils are provided, everything from the hindlimb of Dromornis stirtoni to the top view of the skull of Leaellynasaura to numerous fish fossils. The primary focus appears to be on dinosaurs, though extinct mammals are well covered as well. <br />Accompanying the photographs are short articles detailing various aspects of the region's history, such as extinction of Australia's Quarternary megafauna, the floodplain faunas of the Great Southern Rift Valley of the Early Cretaceous, the role the increasing aridity of post-Miocene Australia played in evolution,  and the fauna of the Gogo Reef. Longer articles deal with the basic geologic and paleontological history of Gondwana, the history of research there, and the role of Gondwana in the global context of worldwide evolution of animals. Numerous photographs of wildlife today accompany discussions of the unique biogeography of Australia and the role isolation has played in the development of the organisms there. <br />A beautiful coffee-table book, I hold from giving five stars for two reasons. One, the price is fairly high; though a really nice book to own, it may be out of the price range for many, or at least more than they really want to pay. Two, though the numerous photographs of fossils in the book are really high quality, I think the book could have benefitted from more artists' illustrations of the animals and their environment in life. Though a few nice ones are included, several more could have really added to the value and popular appeal of this book. Many of the extinct fauna of Gondwana are bizarre and fascinating, particularly some of the extinct marsupial megafauna, and it would have been nice to see more illustrations of how they looked in life. All in all though a really well donebook.	2001-03-03

A great concept.<br />Unfortunately it was rather unevenly carried out. The non-fiction sections are quite good, though a few are relatively dry to read. I did learn a few things reading these sections, and alone they just about make the book worthwhile. There were some interesting discussions over the relationship of prosauropods and sauropods for instance, and there was a great article on migrating dinosaurs. <br />However the short stories vary alot in style and quality, some quite good, other more moderately decent, and a few frankly terrible and hard to get through. The short stories and non-fictions are paired together, and it looks like they found it difficult to find a short story to put with some of the non-fiction sections. <br />Though this may only apply to the hard-cover edition which I have, I feel I must point out the book was either poorly edited, which I find suprising, or poorly published. The book was replete with words that were run together, misplaced punctuation, odd gaps in sentences, and even misspelled words. They were so common at times that it was jarring and irritating. While many books have one or two such errors, there were many of them in this work. Hopefully the paperback version cleared this up.<br />Having said that though this was still not a bad book and a worthwhile one to get, though frankly I would not place at the top of the list of books to fill your dinosaur needs. Still, wouldn't be bad to have either.	2001-03-03

Parts of it are, well, not so good.<br />The good first. The authors make an effort to depict entire environments throughout the Mesozoic of North America, not just focusing on showy (though fascinating) dinosaurs. Reading like a nature show transcript, Colgrande and Felder don't discuss scientific theories or paleontoligsts, but try to place in you the actual landscape of the past, whether a Triassic rain forest or a Jurassic inland sea. Plants, invertebrates, birds, mammals, other reptiles, pterosaurs, marine reptiles are all discussed being born, living, and dying in lush worlds.<br />Some of the descriptions are quite engaging. I especially loved the Triassic rain forest (preserved as the petrified forest) and the Niobrara Sea. <br />Another plus are some of the illustrations. The ones of marine life are inspired, and others are quite excellent. In a field increasingly crowded with prehistoric art, some of this stands out. <br />Now the bad. This book is full of theories, and it doesnt' really tell you that, or doesn't stress it. Some, such as the idea that hypsilophodontids might have been corpophages is interesting, but it is just that - a theory. No evidence of it. And some of the theories (or illustrations showing such theories) are arugably wrong. Several dinosaurs species are shown as feathered as young, but scaled as adults. From what I understand this just not possible. Those are two entirely two different types of external covering, and it is not possible to switch from one to the another; if you are born with feathers, you live your life with feathers, you don't switch to scales at a certain age. Yes, birds have down while in the nest, but later get feathers, not scales. While this makes for some pretty pictures, and yes some dinosaurs species may have been feathered their entire lives, there is no evidence to suggest feathered (or furred for that matter) hadrosaurs. <br />Anotherbad point is ironically the illustrations. Though some are quite good, others are not good. Some come across as wooden or simplistic, while others are strangely unconvincing. One or two I would even describe as bad. Perhaps the illustrator wasn't quite as trained as he should have been, perhaps a few subjects were beyond his grasp, or maybe this was simply too much to paint, an overly ambitious project.<br />This book is an interesting one and can certainly inspire debate among amateur paleonotologists such as myself, but this might not be the best book available.	2001-03-02

Raup does an extraordinary job in this fine work on the mysteries of extinction. Addressing not only the infamous K-T extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs, pterosaurs, prehistoric marine reptiles, ammonites, and many less well known organims of the Mesozoic, he addresses other significant extinction events in earth's history, ranging from the Cambrian period all the way up to extinctions in recent centuries, such as the heath hen in the eastern United States. Raup is able to draw many interesting theories and conclusions by analyzing extinction as an event and process seperate from and beyond the details of the individual organisms. Too many works, at least popular works, dwell overmuch on the extinction of the dinosaurs and related archosaur fauna (and to a lesser extent the mammalian and avian megafauna at the end of the Pleistocene)and fail to draw overall conclusions about what extinction is, how it comes about, and what roles it plays in the history of life on earth. Though the details of particular organims that become extinct are important, Raup seeks to draw broader and more widely applicable conclusions, and in this he succeeds brilliantly.<br />Raup analyzes and addresses a variety of potential causes of extinction from biological (such as predation, epidemic disease, etc.) to physical (sea level rises and falls, volcanism, etc.) to fairly exotic (cosmic radiation, asteroid impact, etc.), as well of course interactions between various causes. He also discusses the importance of small population sizes playing a role in and of themselves in a species extinction, how small populations (using the heath hen as an example) are uniquely vulnerable to such factors as demographic stochasticity, extrinsic forces, social dysfunction, and so forth, all described in informative but very readable format. The debate over the role of small population size is particularly interesting in discussions of potential modern day extinctions, a probelm faced by modern day conservationists and environmentalists. <br />Weaving in discussions of probability, statistics, geology, astronomy, climate, and the overall history of life on earth, Raup does an excellent job on the subject of extinction. Any amateur paleontologist or indeed biologist, as well as those involved in conservation efforts, would be well served by this book.	2001-03-02

The chapter on prehistoric creatures was pretty interesting, and considering the dearth of popular works on extinct mammals make this book a worthwhile read alone. <br />Tudge though is at his best when describing the various types of early humans and protohumans -from the various types of Australopithecines to Homo sapiens - and how they evolved, how they lived, and in some cases, how they spread. Useful are his discussion of ecomorphs and how the generalized ecomorphs of primates favored the development of bipedal, tool-using, intelligent protohumans, and his coverage of the diet of australopithecines and early humans and how this affected our evolution, as well as what we know of these beings. Tudge also provides a lot of interesting theories and information regarding the spread of not only Homo sapiens into the world but Homo erectus before him; also theories as to what happened to the Neanderthals and if they were a seperate species or not are detailed as well.<br />The Tudge book is not perfect though. I think he spends too much time on background prior to discussions of early man. Though interesting, they take up a sizeable section of the book. Some of the asides in the chapter on extinct mammals while interesting are controversial, though he does provide citations for those interested in checking on things. Examples include his mentioning of the theory that giant ground sloths may have been arboreal, that the mastodon genus Cuvieronius may have survived in Central America until several centuries after Christ, and that the dwarf mammoth of Wrangel Island (which survived into historic times, this has been well documented) is actually pictured on a pharaoh's tomb in Egypt, according to some having been illustrated when one was presented as a gift!  <br />Still, I wouldn't let some of these controversial statements steer potential readers away from this book. It still provides decent coverage of extinct mammals, concepts in paleontology, and a good coverage of eartly man, his development, and spread around the globe.	2001-03-02

Not merely a book on the debate over the dropping of the atomic bombs, though at its core it is that, but a thorough retelling of the final months, days, even hours of the war against the empire of Japan. <br />Frank provides extensive information on all aspects of the final push against Japan, including intelligence briefings, intercepted military and diplomatic radio communications, thoughts of leading policymakers both civilian and military in both Japan and the the Allied nations, final Japanese activities in the Pacific and in China, American naval actitity in and around Japanese waters including blockading actions, and the extensive convential air campaign against Japan. <br />Frank draws upon all this information to show that not only was Japan not close to surrender prior to the dropping of the two atomic bombs, but that very likely the dropping of the bombs - and the subsequent surrender - likely saved many millions of American, Allied, and Japanese lives. Frank does not glamorize war and does not flinch from portraying the suffering from conventional and nuclear bombing raids, but he makes a compelling and highly logical case that the suffering would have orders of magnitude worse if invasion had occurred.<br />Frank has very detailed discussions of the proposed Allied invasions of Japan, including troop, aircraft, and naval strengths and deployments on boths sides and detailed battle plan maps, as well as discussions over the terrain of the proposed landing areas and the likely involvement of Japanese civilians. For those interested in what &quot;might have been&quot; the sections detailing the hypothetical invasion that thankfully never came are pure gold.<br />I don't think anyone can find a better case anywhere for why the US dropped the bomb, nor a better chronicle of the decision to drop it and the events and atmosphere in Japan and the US leading up to it.

Though skilled writers can most the seemingly most arcane and esoteric aspects of history interesting, Gannon has written a riveting account of the first U-boat attacks along the US coast in World War II. Reading ever bit like a great Tom Clancy novel (or something similiar), Gannon puts you in the action as if you were on a U-boat, or the merchant ships that were hunted, or in Bletchley Park trying to figure out U-boat actions and intentions and warn the slumbering American merchant ships and port cities. <br />Much of the work focuses on the actions of a representative U-boat from this operation, U-123 commanded by Captain Reinhard Hardegen. You follow him, his officers, and crew from their U-boat pens in occupied France as they sortie out into the stormy North Atlantic and engage in operations up and down the American coast, attacking merchant ships that were not prepared for a sudden Nazi assault, backlight by cities that were not apparently aware that a war was going on. Often in full view of major cities and beachgoers on vaction, Hardegen and other U-boat commanders sunk merchant craft in a period of extraordinary success for the German Navy.<br />Gannon also chronciles the efforts to find and track the U-boats, both in war-weary and desperate British circles and in somewhat naive and arrogant American circles. Gannon paints an interesting contrast between the highly effective and dedicated British Naval Intelligence, working around the clock to amass as much information on each U-boat, right down to personal details on the commanders, and their American counterparts under Admiral King, who were unprepared and were slow to see the need to take countermeasures against the sudden attacks, at some points unsure of what to do, and slow to implement them. Gannon describes King as a man unconcerned and ill-prepared to deal with the Battle of the Atlantic. For all his heroics in the Pacific, King, accoring to Gannon, costs lives and equipment again and again in the war versus Hitler's submarines through inaction and poor action.  <br />A great book, highly recommended.	2001-03-02

Alcocok observed the intimate details of the birth, breeding habits, feeding habits, and sometimes death of a large variety of Australian birds, insects, and mammals. Each chapter devoted to a particular species, he covers not only well known species such as the kookaburra, flying fox, and platypus, but lesser known ones (at least to Americans), such as the northern logrunner, resin wasp, and silver gull. <br />Alcock not only covers the life habits of a number of species, but also during the course of the book, using these species as examples, explores many concepts in biology. Why do birds sing so early in the morning? Are marsupials really primitive and not able to compete with placental mamamls (such as dogs and horses)? Particulary interesting are his speculations on adaptations on animals. Do all the features of an animal, from the cooperative efforts by grey-crowned babblers to raise a brood of young to the red tail feathers in the otherwise black red-tailed cockatoo all surve useful purposes in species (and individual) survival and were the results of evoultion, or is it wrong to atttribute every feature and behavior an animal to direct survival of individuals and the production of new offspring?<br />A highly worthwhile and readable book, I recommend it.	2001-03-02

Fortey in a wonderful, informative, well-written, and highly readable book details the history of life on earth from its origin to the last ice age. He brings to light (and life) many topics not as well known to the popular follower of things paleontological, such as the discovery of diverse faunas in the late Precambrian, debates over the nature and importance of the Burgess Shale fauna, and issues over the origination of the first land vertebrates. He discusses in an authoritative but easily understood manner some of the lesser known but none the less important organims in earth's past, many of which are I weren't familiar with, such as graptolites and conodonts. <br />Fortey intersperses his wonderful text with personal ancedotes from his years in the field - he is an expert on all things trilobite - as well as asides from the history of paleonotology as a science. Not distracting, but fun to read and really show how paleontology exists as a field and a profession. <br />I found the book quite delightful and highly recommend it. I look forward to reading his book on trilobites, which I am sure is excellent as well. Fortey shows there is more to prehistoric life than dinosaurs (though he does cover them too), and what wonderful life that was.	2001-03-01

Focusing mainly on the work of LSU ornithologists and in particular the accomplished John O'Neill, it provides a first hand view of such expeditions, describes many of the new birds species found, shows how ornithologists work (it's not just bird-watching either), and provides interesting discussions on issues relating to taxonomy, scientific credibility, collecting specimens, conservation, neotropical ecology, evolution, and even South American politics. I highly recommend it.	2001-03-01

Tyson shows us a virtual continent that is largey unknown to the rest of the world, home to bizarre wildlife found nowhere else on earth and enigmas that still confound researchers.  Tyson addresses many issues relating to Madagascar. Why are so many plants and animals unique to Madagascar? Why did they speciate so wildly? How did they get there to begin with?  Describing in detail the extinct megafauna of Madagascar - giant lemurs, giant tortoises, pygmy hippos, and the mighty elephant bird - he addresses issues of how they lived, research relating to them, and how they became extinct - if all of them are indeed extinct, as some may still exist in unexplored corners of the giant island. <br />Tyson also addresses the history of the island, from its original settlement apparently around the time of Christ to the present day. The origin of the Malagasy people is still a mystery, and Tyson explores Indonesian, Africa, and Arabian (as well as later European) influxes and influences on the island, not only in terms of history and archeology but also religion, culture, society, psychology, and how the people of the island make a living. The Malagasy are a fascinating blend of Indonesian, African, and Arabian peoples, showing diverse traits from these cultures and providing a continual mystery to researchers. <br />Tyson closes the book with a detailed and comprehensive look at the effort to save the last wild areas of Madagascar. Showing how a new national park is working, he shows that much has been accomplished on the island, but much remains to be done, and the preservation effort is fraught with peril. If conservationists are to save the unique chameleons, geckos, tenrecs, lemurs, serpent eagles, and other wildlife of Madgascar, as well as its unqiue flora, Tyson shows how they must address basic issues of human dignity, the economy, land rights, and basic education as well. <br />A truly great book, a wonderful introduction to Madagascar that I just can't recommend highly enough!	2001-03-01

Thorough in its coverage, it speaks of issues relating to the biology and geology of the deep sea, replete with dragon fish, angler fish, hydrothermal vents, weird worms, crinoids, and all manner of seemingly alien life forms. Read about the search for &quot;living fossils&quot; and relics of bygone ages, as well as the quest for that enigmatic monster, the giant squid.  Several black and white illustrations help bring these organisms to life.<br />The book also covers the human history with relation to the deep sea as well, chronicling the exploration of the deep and man's views of it, from the days of ancient history through Jules Verne through Cold War intrigue. The history of many famous deep sea submarines and exploration vehicles are provided, as well as the men and often politics behind them. Not all uses of the deep sea have been peaceful, as illustrated by coverage of US-Soviet interactions during the last 50 years, well covered in this book.<br />I recommend this book, as not only it is a great nature and science book but also a history book, a rare thing. It is very readable and has kept up the last few nights.	2001-03-01

Though a bit technical at times, it has a good overview of bird evolution and of fossil birds throughout the Mesozoic and throughout the Cenozoic, with excellent coverage of many Tertiary species, especially at Green River(from the Eocene of Wyoming) and Messel (from the Eocene of Central Europe). Their relationship to dinosaurs is well covered, and some time is spent on the K/T event that ended much Mesozoic life. Numerous diagrams and illustrations and a thorough bibliography. While not all may agree with his take on Protoavis, this remains a worthwhile on avian evolution and fossil bird speciesA good book.	2001-03-01

The book chronicles not only his search for the bird and aspects of its natural history, but presents encounters with many other birds of Central America as well. Home to some wondrous birds in the almost magical rain forests, Maslow shows though that the avifauna and the land they inhabit is threatened by instable politics, unchecked population growth, and deforestation. A must read for any interested in birds south of the border.	2001-03-01
US	52590451	R3A67S0KZLUTJL	1563318296	664584609	Atlas of the Prehistoric World	Books	4	19	19	N	N	good intro on prehistoric life	I found this book delightful. While not as hard hitting or as &quot;meaty&quot; as Fortey's Life or the recent Scientific American Book of Dinosaurs, it does provide a nice overview in coffee-table-book-format of life on earth. I liked how it presented the fauna and flora for each geologic period, illustrating a particular environment for a given location in that time period, such as the Ghost Ranch fauna in Triassic New Mexico or the Vendian fauna from Precambrian Australia. I particularly liked the Riversleigh marsupial fauna and the Eocene Messel fauna (and flora too) of Germany.<br />There are many nice maps of the Earth throughout its history showing the appearence and disappearance of the continents, tracing the rise and fall of Pangea, Gondwanaland, and Laurasia.<br />The book has several appendices about a number of subjects, such as volcanoes, plate tectonics, fossil formation, sedminentation, and biographies of major paleonotologists. They are rather basic, but help make this a great book for those new to prehistoric life and would make this an excellent text for middle school or high school students.	2001-03-01

One of its strongpoint is that he provides a lot of background in addressing the problems and events of the Second World War.  In order to understand why the Battle of France was fought the way it was,  he takes you back to the First World War, the lessons &quot;learned,&quot;  and events in the various armies between the war. To shed light on the  Battle of Britain and the Blitz, he brings you the bombings of London in  WWI, and what was thought of that at the time. In many cases, in order to  understand why generals and admirals commanded their troops to do certain  things, and why certain types of equipment were or were not available, you  had to understand the mind set of the time, and the history they were  drawing upon.<br />Another strength of the book is its look at the  personalities of the people involved, which as much as anything else helped  determine who won or lost. From Churchill to Rommel to Zhukov, you have to  understand to an extent their personal motivations, how they interacted  with their subordinates and superiors, and the lessons they had learned  earlier in life. Churchill for instance was shaped by early life  experiences in Cuba prior to the Spanish-American War and during the Boer  War, and by his serving as the civilian head of the Royal Navy.<br />The book  is pretty harsh on the British. While clearly liking the British (he is  British himself), and greatly impressed by the courage of many of her  warriors, again and again he lays into them for shortsightedness, petty  infighting, turf wars, and failure to learn from battle.<br />All and all a  good book. Less good for an overall history of the war, but better to  understand some of the background of the war, some of the personalites  involved, and why the two sides did not do better than they did.	2000-05-27
