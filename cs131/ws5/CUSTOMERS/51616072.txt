Why would a retired football star ask his wife of eleven years to divorce him? Why would a woman run from a man who loves her dearly? These two questions plagued my mind as I read Ivy's Dilemma. Not to fear the author does a magnificent job at not only answering these questions but giving you enough history where it allows you to have compassion for the characters involved.<br /><br />True to life characters that remind you of your bestfriend along with believable situations make Ivy's Dilemma an engrossing and exciting read.<br /><br />Young love, parental love, family love, spiritual love and friendship love, its not always about me nor the situation was the message I walked away with after reading the last page. Reign, truly wrote from her heart and I cannot wait to read the rest of the series.	2005-09-20

A crisp new voice in urban literature, Danielle Santiago gives her readers a raw and true voice that commands attention. Chapter after chapter the reader is drawn not into a story but the life of a deadly Little Ghetto Girl named Kisa Kane. Soldiers in Kisa' lucrative drug business; Eisani and Ta-Ta who also happen to be her cousins are also as deadly.<br /><br />I have heard other readers compare Kisa Kane to Winter in Coldest Winter Ever. The game might be the same but the characters are not. Kisa had her own paper while Winter was large because of another. Kisa has been in the game since she was nineteen years of age. Her boyfriend Sincere is also in the game and at the top of it. As Kisa tries numerous times to leave the game, the forces continue to pull her back. Little Ghetto Girl gives you a glimpse of the consequences from the choices we make. You are either true to the game or your not, you cannot have one foot in and the other one out. Ask Kisa, Sincere and Lena, Sincere' mother.<br /><br />I don't know if my review will do much justice. I hope it does because Little Ghetto Girl is a must read! If my review alone does not convince you then the thirty something reviews combined should. The average review ratings is a 5, I absolutely loved it! My emotions were up and down I was excited as I turned every single page. One point I was left with when I closed this book was the grass is not greener on the other side and if it is you  might be looking at astro-turf!<br /><br />Missy<br /><br />Bound Galley read, purchased at HBF 2002 - I am waiting for Grinding For Keeps..I feel Maddy's, Kennedy and the boys pain.	2005-08-24

In this fast paced emotionally driven novel we are introduced to Rachel, mother of Grace and Eric who were raised by matriarch Mama Belle until her death.<br /><br />After that time because of Rachel's inability to care for her children they are sent to live with relatives. The consequences of the choices she made and those that were made for her divides the family and only God can heal the open wounds. Lost on how to love and hurt because she thinks her mother preferred alcohol, men and her brother over her; Grace begins singing in a jazz club in New Orleans and having frivolous affairs with men whose name she cannot remember to ease the pain of her past. In life and in literature the very thing we run from always seems to find us.<br /><br />The author has an amazing anointing to capture life issues that tug at your heart long after you close the book. The Things She Does at Night photographs the young adult in us all trying to find something to fill the void left by a family member. I truly enjoyed this novel for many reasons but the main one being it was well written with wonderful characters that jumped right off the page.<br /><br />Missy	2005-08-12

When one of my local book club members nominated it for our January read I thought wow, can I do it. I must admit I am very glad I did, it is obvious the book is long, that goes without saying. What lines between the front and back jacket is an African American look at feuds, mob like family saga and a look at a mis-understood man.<br /><br />The story opens with Leroi Tremain and his uncle Jake trying to raid the Dumont family terrain. In doing so Jake gets killed and Leroi kills two white deputies. At the advice of the family elder he if forced to leave everything he knows and love until \\"things cool down\\" as his family says. His departure takes him on a wild Wild West ride from Louisiana, Oklahoma, New York and San Francisco.<br /><br />Standing at the Scratch Line tracks Leroi's life and revelations from being Leroi to King, from his early teens to his 40's. It forces the reader to examine the justice system then and now. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and look forward to its sequel.<br /><br />Missy	2005-02-02

When she encounters strife at the job from another black woman things really begin to heat up.<br /><br />The author writes a well written story which many of us can identify with; the juggling game. Char wants to get ahead by works while behind the conference room doors the knives are pointing at her back. Her personal relationship is as stressful as her quest to be the first black manager at her company. The protagonist, Charvette trades one pain for another which disguises itself as satisfaction, nevertheless Charvette' character is strong willed and she continues to finds a way.<br /><br />The idea of Working in the Dark was one all of us needed to hear, but the delivery was a little weak. I wanted to become Charvette' friend but she was not developed enough, her situation tugged at my heart, but nothing more. I am always looking for something different to read and this certainly was.

Her characters quickly become family and you get so wrapped up in their lives you are literally laughing out loud, or choked by your tears.<br /><br />I read an article online a couple of years ago by Lauretta Pierce of The Literary World.

Included within each chapter is a &quot;point to ponder&quot; &quot;a verse to remember&quot; and &quot;a question to consider&quot; wonderful format.<br />However the end result only touches the surface and could be an insult to mature Christians. The concept and idea was a good one but the delivery sucked.<br />Rick Warren makes a claim that his book is a blueprint for Christians living in the 21st Century. I can agree with that if the Christian is a mature one and knows how to read the Word.<br />Not proof-texting, which allows you to say anything you want with scripture. It allows you to win the argument of the hour.<br />I was shocked at the paraphrasing and incomplete use of the word. For example, on page 41, the question under the chapter heading is What is your life? followed by a scripture reference James 4;14b (NIV). As a mature Christian my Pastor told me read it for yourself and this is what MY bible says: James 4<br />14 How do you know what will happen tomorrow? For your life is like the morning fog--it's here a little while, then it's gone.<br />I will repeat myself this technique is fine for the mature Christians or for someone who was taught to learn it for yourself. However I believe this book should be read but if you are new to your walk please do not pick this book up without an open mind and a bible right next to you.	2004-07-01

While on the other hand I thought why what are we (black people) a science project.<br />Clearly as you read the book your questions change and your initial emotions are either magnified or remain the same. One question blanketed me throughout the book, why leave your privileged life to walk in the shoes of a black man or any minority?<br />This classical non-fiction journal of the writers experience was captivating and educational. Walking behind Johns' eyes allowed me to see my people and the actions of others in a different light. The author captures the accents and slang in such a way I could hear the characters speaking.<br />It is my hope that many different people will read Black Like Me, and realize that people are \\"human individuals\\" the actions of some or one does not represent the total race.<br />Missy	2004-02-26

Why did he do it? Why was her best friend being so evasive? Why did she leave Kelly? In another I was overjoyed at Shanta and her sister Abby's luck at finding their potential love mate in a very unlikely place.<br />Ms. Grosvenor has five works of fiction, one non-fiction and one poetry book under her belt. An author whose bio is as colorful as a bag of skittles proves she has skills. I was truly entertained by all three stories in Pretty Boys, and look forward to future works by this author.	2004-02-04

Can she stand by and watch or does she move up from the shadows and snatch back her sons and their friends into her bosom?<br />Ascending Shadows was a fast-paced tale that every young male should read, and every mother, sister and aunt should tell.<br />The one message I walked away with after turning the last page of Ascending Shadows was, sometimes we are all victims of our environment.

She must use those roots and folklore to help her see what is in front of her face.<br />I absolutely adored the way this story was told, the book opened with Grandma Ollie writing in her bible and closed the same way.  As I read this story, I felt that I was sitting in on those hair-brushing moments Terri and Grandma Ollie shared. I often wondered if Grandma Ollie was in fact the author's grandmother who raised her.<br />It is my hope that this review reaches everyone who likes a feel good story, because this is certainly it.

For ten years, JC sat in his cell harboring thoughts of revenge against his childhood friends who gave him up to save themselves.<br />Triple Take will astound you; it is not an innovative read, but the writing  certainly is. You can tell the author is a poet by his eloquent writing style. Moore creatively draws you into each chapter, giving you the reader just enough to have you guessing who this chapter will be about and what fate will beset them.<br />Donald Goines wrote from memory of how his neighbors lived and how some died. Moore uses this same style of writing easily because he grew up in the projects on the far South-side of Chi-Town. He has the language and lifestyle photocopied to memory. One of my favorite genres is `Ghetto Realism\\" and Y. Blak Moore is certainly one author to watch out for. I look forward to his future works and plan to save a space for them on my bookshelf.<br />Triple Play is for the reader who can handle an intense and explosive read, in addition to a page-turner.<br />Missy	2003-03-13

One way of doing this is to have a winning attitude, think positive, nothing we have not heard before right? Well this author proceeds to say that faith and positive thinking does not work alone, you need to take action. Gain control of your life, gain ownership of some real estate. The modern slave is of no race, creed or color.<br />Robert Henderson, Jr. exercises the use of cliches and scripture lessons to expound on his point. Sometimes it is repetitive but in view of the fact that it reads like good news that we slaves (people) need, so be it. I believe the one message Henderson wanted us to walk away with is this, we as slaves need to begin taking advantage of America and all of its riches.

If someone were taking applications for the most depressed and broken spirited, Stanice would definitely get the job. Her feelings about her life worth were void, but God had plans for her. I Say a Prayer for Me, chronicles her faith and jubilation as she struggles to survive and believe.<br />Going to the Go-Go's was a priority for Stanice. It did not matter that she worked a day job and partied until 2am. Her addiction started innocently, she only wanted to stay awake at work, and No Doz was just the thing. How she went from No Doz to heroine is an incredible story.<br />I Say a Prayer for Me is filled with devotionals and spiritual boosters after every chapter. You can incorporate them for your personal use. As Stanice's walk with faith was being born, she hit many lows, but we also saw her positives. This piece of non-fiction gives the reader a well-rounded view of addiction and the struggles one can go through. After closing I Say a Prayer for Me, the most prominent message I walked away with was the battles are not ours alone, Yolanda Adams sings \\"It's the Lord's \\" and I am a firm believer of that.<br />Missy<br />APOOO Bookclub	2003-02-16

Baby Momma Drama by Carl Weber<br />Reviewed by Missy<br />APOOO Rating: 4<br />Amazon Rating: 4<br />Carl Weber is dubbed by many as the King of Drama, and after reading his third book Baby Momma Drama, I am inclined to agree. Have you ever given any thought to what \\"Baby Momma Drama\\" entails? If not, you need to read Carl Webers latest. Each character offers us a different insight into \\"Baby Momma Drama.\\"<br />Baby Momma Drama # 1- Jasmine is currently dating Derrick the drug dealing roughneck who fathered a baby with his ex, Wendy. Jasmine finds herself making decisions that are morally incorrect for her out of fear of losing her man to his Baby Momma. In the end, she is pushed over the edge.<br />Baby Daddy Drama # 2- Stephanie has a good man willing to be<br />the \\"Baby Daddy\\" but she cannot stay out of her daughters Baby Daddys boxers. She certainly finds it easy to put her man's needs on the back burner, though.<br />Momma Drama # 3-Big Momma, grandmother to Jasmine and Stephanie can jump-start more drama than a little bit. She is meddling and always trying to bully her way into her grand daughters lives.<br />Mixed with all this drama is a whole lot of sex and spontaneous<br />decisions that have lasting repercussions. A baby is born into<br />horrible circumstances, and Jasmine unwillingly finds herself back in \\"Baby Momma Drama\\" but in a different light. Wendy and Derrick wind up in the big house doing big time.<br />Carl Weber did an excellent job of delivering a story filled with drama that was not only believable but also entertaining. I enjoyed hearing the male perspective on drama. If you like reading the drama of characters whose actions are consistent and not so far out there, then this is the next book you should be reading.<br />Missy<br />APOOO BookClub	2003-02-09

Barnett's first book titled Callaloo & Other Lesbian Love Tales. Many of the lesbian theme books available do not show the positive side of loving another women; the tender moments shared in a way that Callaloo does. Most of the stories in these 197 pages are from another era; a time when it was taboo to love another woman. Each story fills me with pride and appreciation for those who paved the way for us.<br />In \\"The Homecoming of Narda Boggs, a slave girl is brought to life by the European massa's daughter who happens to be African American. \\"Black Triangles, Rainbows and Dykes\\" gave the reader a little history of the upside down triangle. It initially started out as a negative and the gay and lesbian community brought the symbol alive. In Nazi Concentration camps when lesbians were \\"outed\\", they were forced to wear upside down triangles. The very last short \\"Callaloo\\" explains the origins of the word and how deep one will go to make their partner happy.<br />Some of the stories were lacking consistency. The language used to define the eras were mixed. The book promised love tales and it certainly makes good on that promise. When I reached the last pages of the book, it saddened me that LaShonda K. Barnett parked her pen. Although it excited me more to know she will be steering it again to complete Jam her second book.<br />Missy	2003-01-26

Anderson offers the reader a refreshing story of a young man's walk with faith and personal growth. The main character, Salliq Washington, thinks he has it all, unfortunately it takes some hard knocks before he realizes his life is amiss, and what having it all truly means. One of my favorite lines from the book is the very last one and I quote, &quot;There is no need to search any longer, Salliq Washington has finally been found.&quot;<br />The author's style of writing was concise and upbeat. Finding Salliq began just as it ended with a bang, and it really draws you into the story. It was different reading Salliq's thoughts. Initially I didn't expect to enjoy Finding Salliq because I am not fond of narrative reads but this one was written with so many twists and turns it kept me intrigued. In addition to the storyline, the songs in the book really took me back to a time when I was club hopping and finger popping. I had one small problem with the book, the editing caused me to re-read many sentences where small words were missing.<br />As I read this book, a few phrases kept coming to my mind. The first one was &quot;we are all a work in progress&quot; and Salliq certainly proved that. Finding Salliq is a testimony of faith, growth and making your own way in life instead of waiting for others to do it for you. Sometimes doing the right thing means leaving those you love behind. Robert L. Anderson has written an excellent book and it is my credence that Finding Salliq is for everyone.<br />Reviewed by Missy<br />APOOO BookClub	2003-01-25

Reed delivers an innocent adult read, appropriately titled Midnight Sunshine. Midnight Sunshine depicts the time of day it is in the United States when Nathan Patterson receives his call from his sunshine, Marife Velasquez, who lives in the Philippines.<br />When reading a magazine Nathan sees an advertisement that changes his life. The ad reads Beautiful, Faithful, Asian Women Want to Meet and Marry You. Through letters and a wonderfully told story, one which the reader gets to bare witness to, a love unfolds between a lonely successful African-American man who should have it all and a financially poor Asian woman who wants it all, emotionally.<br />The story between Nathan and Marife is somewhat like my own. I met my soulmate over the internet 6 years ago. I, like Marife, left my home state to be with my partner. I, on the other hand, moved with more luggage than Marife. She traveled with only one bag to Boston to meet Nathan.<br />Midnight Sunshine had a mixture of vibrant characters that blended well with the story. Each one had their own voice and unfolded wonderfully. As the story progressed I could feel all the personal touches that were added to the book and the research the author did in getting the Filipino language down.

I feel truly blessed that Mr. Ross feels passionate about African Americans that he has put it on paper for all to read. For fourteen months the author traveled all over gathering, interviewing and collecting stories from ordinary people with everyday lives.<br />Chapter after chapter The Ways of Black Folks offer invaluable information that anyone can identify with.

I have to smile now at my ignorance, what is that old saying \\"Ignorance is Bliss.\\" Under the chapter title, the geography of where the interviewee is from is listed along with a quote.<br />The Ways of Black Folks, A Year in the Life of a People, was a very informative read.

Now let us fast forward to 2002 and add a little ghetto fabulous flair to both. Raven Ward, twenty-something sassy and always horny will stop at nothing to get her boots waxed. Her greatest accomplishment in life is to seek revenge on those who have wronged her, by any means necessary. Her morals are straight out of the \\"me generation.\\" The reason given for Raven's irresponsible behavior however is not a plausible one. It feels like foreplay without the actual act.<br />The flow of this book sometimes seem uneven from paragraph to paragraph. On several occasions characters' voices changed so quickly I had to re-read the paragraph. This book should be applauded for the racey language used in the detail of events expressed and knowledge of sexual acts. The omission of the storyline and character history is an oversight which caused this reader to give a mediocre rating of a 2.5 on the APOOO scale.

I had the opportunity to spend time with Darline Dorce-Coupet at the Harlem 2002 Book Festival. She was eager to hear my and my book club thoughts on Embracing the Horror. Unfortunately, I had not read it at that time.<br />I finished the book this past Thursday night and I am still<br />assimilating the story. Many times throughout my life I wished for the power Arielle dominated. The capacity to hunger and pine for sex as she did. Arielle Erin Symonette shared her temple with a Goddess named Erzulie, The Goddess of Love and Desire, who tormented her soul to the degree that Arielle was not aware of and the men who thought of her sexual appetite as voracious; she was the best lover they ever had.<br />Arielle attempts to love two men, one her husband Cedric Courage, who is under her spell and adores her or is it the Goddess inside her that has him under a spell. On the other side of the spectrum is Danyel Champion, a brother who knows exactly what to do with Arielle&#146;s sexual hunger, but because theirs is a forbidden lust they resume their relationship behind the confines of their separate residences. Not only<br />is Arielle a married woman, but she and Danyel hold a secret so taboo that it can haunt them and their family for generations to come.<br />Embracing the Horror is a little over 600 pages, and once you pick up the book and begin, reading you will continue to turn pages. The author does an excellent job of storytelling, I was lost in it most times. Her delivery and promise of a story of Forbidden Love was met without a doubt. I would recommend this book to anyone who has an affinity for suspense, the supernatural and erotica.<br />Missy<br />APOOO BookClub	2002-11-11

I chose the book because of the<br />beautiful cover. I borrowed Talk of the Town for similar reasons, the<br />cover design; the need to give this duo another chance and lastly Talk<br />of the Town picks up where Revenge is Best Served Cold left off.<br />Talk of the Town is a New York City newspaper which embellishes on the<br />lifestyles of the rich and famous while offering a little gossip as a<br />side dish. Miles Nelson, who is the Executive V.P at Sound<br />Entertainment finds his name splattered on the pages of Talk of the<br />Town after a not so innocent dinner with his VP of A&R, Vic Pellam.<br />As luck would have it, Morgan who is working from home decides to scan<br />the pages of the paper. She notices the mention of her husband's name<br />staring at her from the pages as she continues to read the headline and a<br />seething sensation overwhelms her. Morgan Nelson is the CEO of<br />Cache'and her company is in desperate need of financial backing, the kind the St.<br />James family has offered her. But as the saying goes \\"bad news comes<br />in threes.\\" Morgan makes a decision that could inevitably cause her<br />not only to lose the backing offered to her by Mr. St. James, but her<br />company as well.<br />Best friends save the day for both Miles and Morgan Nelson. Talk of the<br />Town was tied together in a neat bow. Getting to the conclusion was a<br />roller coaster ride, I would definitely take again. Yolanda Joe calls<br />Tracie Howard and Danita Carter the \\"dynamic duo\\" and I concur with<br />her. You do not need to read Revenge is Best Served Cold to enjoy Talk<br />of the Town. However, what is tea without honey? It is good but the<br />honey certainly makes it sweet.<br />I love reading about affluent African Americans who are striving to<br />keep what they have and maintain good friendships.<br />Missy<br />APOOO Bookclub	2002-10-30

Connie Briscoe does such a<br />wonderful job of giving the characters life they all become primary at some point in the book. The storylines draw you and your emotions,whether you want to be in that scene or not.<br />Stereotypes and social issues are in abundance in this book. They are so expertly placed instead of feeding into it, you identify with it and move on. I believe the message in PG County was to make us all connect with race and class so we can begin to build social change.<br />PG County is about many of the ism's; socialism, racism, classcism and materialism, which are the things we allow to limit our relationships and interactions with others. It is about the material things that can get in the way of relationships and family. It is about secrets, history<br />stereotypes and four wonderful characters that only Connie Briscoe could have created with such life. As I read this book, I was right there at the parties eating all the good food and walking around choosing sides throughout the story when needed.<br />Jolene thought if she had enough money it would wash away her childhood teasing, but not all the money in the world could remove the pain in her heart. Pearl's character had it all and was too modest to know it.<br />She struggled with her self worth as did Barbara, her self worth was found in a bottle of vodka and Candice's quest for the truth regarding her heritage brought her more than she bargained for.

Morrison returns with the handsome and unforgettable Wellington Jones and his soul mate Jada \\"Diamond\\" Tanner for another round this time in Never Again Once More. Unfortunately for readers, Wellington is married to another as is Jada, but when it comes to matters of the heart these two make us wonder; does anything else matter?<br />Some readers were disappointed with the break-up of Wellington and Jada towards the end of Soul Mates Dissipates, Mary B.Morrison's sister novel to Never Again Once More. I believe it is because of the readers' idea of what a soul mate is or should be. I enjoyed the book because it showed us how couples who are soul mates are not always put together at the right time.<br />Never Again Once More takes us twenty years into Wellington and Jada's future. Emotionally time stood still for Wellington and Jada, but they learned to go with the motions learning to love others while the passion they held simmering slowly began to heat up and burn those around them. The time might not have been the most opportune for Wellington and Jada, but love takes no prisoners.<br />The characters in Never Again Once More all had hidden desires that they masked by settling for less, until their hearts could hold out no longer. It's funny how the mouth verbalizes never, but the heart screams once more. I thoroughly enjoyed this book; having the chance to meet with old characters from Soul Mates Dissipates and seeing their growth was a welcomed treat.<br />At the beginning of Never Again Once More the time warping was a little confusing and I almost lost the story,but Mary B Morrison made up for it throughout the book, with her clear messages and well developed old and new characters that will tug at your heart.<br />...	2002-09-24

The<br />readers of Getting Unstuck are blessed that Conscious<br />decided to share her sessions at Daytop Village, a<br />long term drug facility with us, through Getting<br />Unstuck. I first heard about Conscious via an email,<br />which highlighted her website...<br />Once I began surfing the site I could not stop. As<br />luck would have it, I was blessed with the opportunity<br />to meet Conscious at the 2002 Harlem Book Festival. I<br />say blessed because, as I read her autobiography, I<br />was able to visualize her actions throughout the book.<br />Getting Unstuck affords us the opportunity to follow<br />Conscious as she comes face to face with repressed<br />memories of her past. Allan, her confidant and<br />counselor, from Daytop Village gives Conscious what she needs to begin her journey to wellness. Through her sessions, she tears at the core of her world. While reading her conversations with Allan, my heart was<br />aching for all the pain and conditions she endured as<br />a child. Chemical, sexual, and mental abuse are not<br />issues that should affect a child's life, but for<br />Conscious, that was her life.<br />The author used a \\"No Holds Barred\\" attitude in<br />writing this autobiography. Getting Unstuck is not for<br />the weak. I remember my thoughts when I read the title,<br />I kept saying getting unstuck from what; someone<br />answered AIDS/HIV. Once Conscious received her calling<br />from God, she knew what was to be her quest. She had to<br />leave the place she was in and move on. In my opinion,<br />to become unstuck, you simply have to face what ever it<br />is, deal with it; then move on by any means necessary.<br />Missy<br />APOOO Book Club	2002-09-11

Throughout the journey of Sugar &amp; Tracy you will find many different reasons Sugar wanted her story told. The one reason I feel held true page after page is &quot;Don't give up, God can change anybody.<br />Two women from opposite lifestyles come together to cleanse one, but ironically they both receive the greatest bath of their lives. Sugar Turner is a hustler, hooker and welfare mother. Amongst her negatives, I found her to have an angelic and smart voice. Ehlers, the author of Sugar's Life in the Hood is a cultural anthropologist and has done an excellent job of showing the social structure of Sugar's world. Sugar's story chronicled how she came from hustling, prostitution and welfare to enrolling in college, being apart of an entrepreneur program and forward to a paying job.<br />The author did an excellent job of painting pictures from Sugar and Ehler's world. I felt like Sugar was my friend and I rooted for her throughout the book. The author and Sugar shared in the telling of this story, because they worked so well together the book was more showing then telling and narration.

Not because I believe I know everything but when I read, I want entertainment. I could not envision a self-help book that could do that. Having What Matters, entertaining moments were strategically placed throughout the book. The author's calm wit kept me turning pages.The nine chapter titles were simple such as, \\"Successfully Defining Success and \\"Leaving the World a Better Place,\\" but they were filled with an abundance of information.<br />After reading the first paragraph of the introduction, and remembering a time my sister took me by Mrs. Greenwood's Bedford Stuyvesant mansion, I regarded her as EF Hutton and I intended to listen to her narration. If listening to her would help me achieve what she has, an eighteen room mansion, a closet filled with designer clothes and shoes, owning four prosperous businesses, two bed and breakfast inns, a restaurant, a coffeehouse as well as a stint as editor in chief of Essence magazine, my ears and eyes are wide open.<br />Having What Matters helps the black woman to define her success. Mrs. Greenwood proudly wears the term \\"bootstrapper\\" mentality. It means a person who has the mindset of not the victim but the winner; an individual who can rise above the trials and tribulations she is faced with. Mrs. Greenwood's burning desire is to be able to give each of us what we need to get what matters to us. What does it matter to have a high paying job, but you dread going to work everyday?

Justin has<br />money, power and woman; he is also married with two<br />children. He plays a dangerous game with women and an<br />even more dangerous one with his wife Alexis.  The<br />author leaves the reader with the impression that<br />Justin learned his ways of infidelity from his father<br />Henry; who he affectionately nicknamed \\"the rooster\\"<br />In the beginning of the book his wife Alexis,<br />surprised me with her cool persona. She continued with<br />her everyday routine knowing her husband was<br />unfaithful to her on more than one occasion. Her<br />seemingly acceptance of Justin's infidelities did not<br />last long.

As a book reviewer I get several books to read, review, and sometimes return. Some of these books are so good I do not want to return them. Ditchdigger's Daughters is one of those books. When I first picked this book up, I was feeling a little defeated and exasperated about my job. This book gave me Donald Thornton wisdom to be the best, never mind that my colleagues are faster and younger. As Donald Thornton would say find the brightest rabbit, catch up to him/her, and pass him.<br />Donald Thornton passed away in 1993. What he left behind for his daughters to peruse is his wit and wisdom. Still today, I bet his daughters have every lesson stored so they can pass it on to their children. He had no education but somehow he raised six girls to become accomplished black women. He used resources within himself that some people would never think of. To finance his children's education they each paid for the other, with the proceeds from their band. The band was called the Thornettes and later changed to the Thornton Sisters, they played for students at Princeton and various other Colleges.<br />Donald Thornton's six splits as family and friends affectionately called him and his girls went on to become more than what anyone expected of them. Betty became a nurse, Linda a dentist, Rita is the head of the science department in a private school, the author of The Ditchdigger's Daughters Yvonne, is an OB/GYN, Donna is a court stenographer and Jeanette has a doctorate in counseling psychology. Their story is not so much  about what they have become but how they got there. The Ditchdigger's Daughters will astound and amaze you. You will think twice before you express what you cannot do in your personal life. The history in this book was wonderful and it was a quick read. Thornton Ladies, I am sure your mother is happy that her wish has come true, to have her family's story told in a book that is in the library. What a hidden treasure, The Ditchdigger's Daughter  is a must read.<br />Missy.<br />Missy	2002-08-15

If Oka the demon is allowed to plant his seed into the chosen one earth as we know it, it will be consumed with darkness and evil.<br /><br />The author Tony Lindsay did a wonderful job of using real life characters such as drug addicts and prostitutes and giving them a purpose whether it was good or bad. Allowing them the opportunity to see something different and to dream a little dream.

Each one dealing with Hope being molested by her stepfather. \\"I squeezed my eyes real tight, but I couldn't get what I had just seen out of my mind. My stepfather's face in between my twin sister's legs. Even with my eyes closed I could still see them.\\"<br />Every time I read one of Miller's books, I learn something. Satin Doll taught me the harm of \\"silent agreements\\" in a relationship. In I'm Telling, I learned it does not matter the outcome of telling a secret you have to get it out and obtain some sort of closure. Faith told the secret, trying to help her sister and Miss Irene's reaction was not what Faith expected.<br />Miss Irene longed for someone to adore all 400 pounds of her, and Hope was so mentally unstable that she never realized the one thing she wanted she already had in her twin sister Faith, to be chosen over another. The characters and the situation pulled me into the story. I felt like I was walking through this novel with Faith and Hope.

I was born in Harlem and raised in Brooklyn; my affinity for the Harlem Renaissance period is strong even today. Each chapter is divided from the1900s  2000, and they are appropriately named. A small biography is placed before the excerpt and what book it was taken from.<br />Devon W. Carbado sectioned the book into different time periods.During the Protest Era a quote jumped off the pages at me \\"To be white male in America and realize your gayness and find out your opressed is a very different thing than being oppressed all your life as a woman of color.\\" In Harlem during the 1920s we witnessed a cultural firecracker with books like never before. I wonder how many of those books were written from Wallace Thurman's boarding house at 136th Street called the Niggerati Manor? There is an American Folk saying; if you want to keep something secret from black folks put it between the covers of a book. Nowadays that is not the case. With titles like Black Like Us and The Greatest Taboo by Delroy Constantine curiosity is winning. Black Like Us makes me feel proud of the many literary giants included in this work, empowering and sending us love.<br />It is the stories and quotes from this book that will keep Black Like Us as a reference tool on reader's shelves for years to come. Julie Blackwomon offers an excerpt from Voyages Out 2  titled \\"Symbols,\\" a short story that reflects Julie's own life. She makes a very intriguing statement, \\"coming out of the closet is more than just a \\"gay thing\\" It is my hope that authors like these in Black Like Us help to cease the homophobia in the gay and heterosexual African American community.

It reminded me of our yearly burning bowl. An event where members of my church we come together to remove all the old stuff from our lives to make room for the new. This is accomplished by writing down the things we want to get rid of and burning them outside in a metal trashcan; it's called feeding the universe.  Once this is accomplished we gather back inside and on a separate piece of paper we write what we want to fill the space with that we just created. This is exactly what this novel by Jacquelyn Jermayne was about.<br />All four characters in this book had some serious cleaning to do. Vivienne needed to let go and let good love in; Catrina needed to understand who she was without a man. Shawntale needed to learn how to remove other peoples garbage from her life; and Myani needed to learn how to release hidden experiences and move on. Of all the characters in this book Myani was my shero. She displayed an inner strength from the first time we were introduced. She was a timid sort of character who I constantly prayed would find inner peace. I also prayed that each character would find the answers they so desperately needed.<br />Initially I thought wow, there's a lot of information in this book regarding the characters, but once I turned the last page I realized most of the information was needed. This is a must read for everyone and when you finish reading it take a look at your closet and ask yourself, &quot;is it time for your cleaning?&quot;<br />Missy APOOO Bookclub.	2002-07-14

Unfortunately, an obsessed fan is about to make her life long dream of becoming a successful author a nightmare. No matter what state she has a book signing in there is a particular man who is always there. She casually mentions it to her best friend Lynda, and asks her not to tell her husband just yet.

She had the strength of 20 woman. This book had me on the edge of my seat turning page after page intrigued to know what was going to happen next.

Upon turning the last page and digesting Darrin Keith Bastfields' words, Tupac Amaru Shakur became my friend and brother. A loss that was magnified ten times after finishing the book.<br />The author takes us on a trip down memory lane of his school days and neighborhood times in Baltimore with Tupac, with mentions of Jada Pinkett now Jada Pinkett Smith and Dana M. Smith a.ka. Mouse the human beatbox. In the prologue Darrin Keith Bastfield says \\"And it is my intention that all of you have this firsthand experience, and be duly affected by it.\\" I can attest that I have been affected and will remain so for a long time.<br />I want to thank the author for validating my thoughts regarding Tupacs' personality.

Hardy is back again with BD, Babyface, Gene, Mitchell, Raheim and his son Lil Brotha Man, a family of wonderful characters I've missed. Love the One You're with delves into the \\"black gay male\\" psyche. Topics such as gay republicans, young boys in school and how to mold them, black identity different mentality and thoughts on bisexuality are widely placed throughout the book. Initially I had a slight problem with this because I wanted to read more about the characters. As I continued to read I realized these issues were the characters and it gave them more life.<br />The novel is told around Raheim while he is away to make his first feature film. Mitchell is left at home with temptations coming from everywhere. There's an old clich&eacute;' when the cat is away the mice will play. Will Mitchell, aka \\"the mouse\\" play and risk the eighteen months he has thus far with Raheim.<br />Grab your favorite blanket, and pick up the book to find out.

For Every Black Eye is for anyone whose loved one has been abused and anyone who is fed up.<br />From the first page you are drawn into the psychotic rage of Febe as she screams \\"Kill Him\\" to Annie. Febe is the childhood protector of Annie, who after 35 years is still fighting the battles Annie cannot. She is the dark side of us all. For 10 years Febe restrained herself as best she could. But now an unborn child is at risk, and she wants the monster and all like him DEAD.<br />CF Hawthorne blends a sick but realistic tale with a cast of believable characters you will get to know. I fell in love with Febe and her strength. Her wit and take no prisoners attitude kept me turning page after page. I have just a small concern; we really didn't get to know Annie, aside from the fact that she was shy and timid. On the other hand maybe this is a smooth tactic the author wanted. If so it leaves me asking myself: Do we ever see who the abused really is inside? Do we ever get to know the abused? I'm afraid not.<br />For Every Black Eye by CF Hawthorne is the best narrative of Domestic Violence I have ever read. Hopefully after you read it, the next time you come face to face with someone crying inside out you will know the sign and can reach out.	2002-05-14

Check out Nina's sister Troi who appears to have everything you could ask for or does she?? Troi's husband Vaughn in his mid twenties still trying and fighting with the little boy in him..... Dominique introduces alot of characters in this book,who are all dysfunctional in their own way. (Aren't we all) Don't sleep on them because I guarantee you will miss something about. She evens has my favorite furbabie in this book a Shih Tzu...the cutiest animal in the American Kennel Club. I believe the author is trying to tell us, we cannot run from who we are nor can we escape things from our childhood by ignoring or buring them, we need to regurgitate. Great book!	2001-01-31

How can you nto see your child in pain and agony, how can you not see a child has a secret she needs to tell.<br />I loved the Rhonda character, she was made out as a princess to Annette but Annette saw through her glass house and realized she had cracks in her windows just like she did. The friendship and secrets they shared I thought would bond them forever, but what tore them apart was enough strain for anyone.<br />There's another character in the book I loved but her name escapes me shewas the blind girl who had the gift of knowing and the insight of a grandma.	2000-11-29

The insight it gave into Sororities was minimal to keep pacs, but enough to stay with the story.<br />Between friends we always forgot each of us have something special to offer each other. So if you ever think you are not as..... think again...Or read Sorority Sisters to understand how you can share that special something you have to offer your sistas.	2000-11-27
