The book is about a little known event in early 1945 when 100+ men from the 6th Ranger Battalion saved 500+ men from a Japanese prisoner of war camp in Cabantuan.  There was every expectation that the Japanese were going to execute these prisoners like they had done to others.  However, the 6th Ranger Battalion had other thoughts on this.  The story of how this event transpires made it hard to put the book down.  I couldn't put the book down, because the writing style kept me interested and the changes in the story kept me wondering how it would end.  This is a great story and the book does a great job of telling it.  I highly recommend this book.	2005-09-24

This, in my opinion, is by far the best of the three books.    It starts off like a race horse, as Grant pushes his strategy to capture Lee.  What is that strategy, you ask yourself?  But, you don't know, as Newt keeps that hidden to you.  It leads to an initial preliminary fight to capture the bridges over the Monocacy river near Frederick.  But, wait, wasn't a battle fought there - the analogies to the real historical fights are uncanny, and start here.  Custer dies in this fight - no Battle of Little Big Horn you ask yourself and wonder what will happen next.  You can't put the book down as you get drawn in.  Scales Confederate division arrives and captures the town, but James McPherson arrives with the Union infantry in the nick of time and Grant tells him to grab hold of Lee \\"and not let him go\\".  McPherson wonders, will his corps survive, will he survive?  But this is for the good of the strategy which you still haven't been told, and you get drawn in further.    A beautiful set of scenes are set up by Newt then to describe the death of a great Civil War general, the marriage to his wife at his deathbed and his wife's response after his death.  More than any other sets of scenes by any other book, you recognize the tragedy that was our Civil War - the tragic loss of human life, and the stupidity of war.  Grant and others wonder, is this being enacted on us because of our sins?    Over the next days, in the town of Frederick, Maryland, the analogies to the battle of Gettysburg unfold including a Confederate charge even larger than Pickett's charge as Lee makes a powerful attempt to roll up Grant's flank and catches him by surprise.    And, the scenes from this battle keep you riveted.  The scenes of the Colored Division standing firm and tall and blocking the charge which threatens to roll-up Grant's flank and win the war.  The scenesof that same division drawing off the Confederates best division the Texas division to fight them behind a railroad cut and a new \\"hornet's nest\\".  The scenes of Lee taking personal lead of the last attack into town and being told by his adjutants to go to the back (much as occurred many times in 1864).  And the scenes of Henry Hunt, a crew of a 3 inch rifled cannon and the confederates charging through the streets of Frederick and the confrontation between them.  And as this happens, Grant's strategy is unfolded to the reader.  But, I won't tell you ending of this well written book.  It was well worth the first two books leading to it.  However, you can also read this book on its own, in my opinion, to get a sense of the tragedy and scale of the Civil War.   Needless to say, unlike one of the reviews provided below the ending is very satisfying.	2005-08-07

This is the best researched history book that I've read in the last year, and it reads like a novel.  Mr. McCullough has researched it all - the major characters, even some of the minor characters, the period, the areas, the battles, everything.  I especially like the little anecdotes about Washington and his generals and also the British generals.  It was interesting to read the disputes in Parliament about what to do about the Americas.  There are some beautiful pictures and maps of the area also included. Excellent book.	2005-08-06

As mentioned in the title, Champion Hill was the decisive battle for Vicksburg, and this book lays out the preliminary events, the post events and what happened during the battle in significant clarity and detail.  The maps are excellent and provide good support for the writing.  Their are numerous pictures and each major officer is depicted.  The details of the battle are laid out at the regiment level, highlighting what each regiment accomplished.  Even more, human interest stories are provided giving the book that personal touch.  In all, this is well written book and highly recommended.	2005-07-30

For example, the traditional view is that the 20th Maine and more specifically, Colonel Chamberlain were the sole winners of this battle.  However, as this book highlights, there were many more individuals who performed a crucial role in this fight, many of whom died due tto their roles.  Like Strong Vincent, who placed the 20th Maine because he led that brigade, and whose leadership at crucial moments assured that the battle on the other side was won, and who also died because of his wounds in this fight.  Like Paddy O'Rourke, whose 146th Pennsylvania came to rescue of a regiment in Vincent's brigade at the right time to stop a Confederate charge, and who also died in this fight.  Like General Weed, who led the brigade which contained the 146th Pennsylvania, who also died in this fight.  Like Lieutenant Hazlett whose battery was crucial to the fight and who also died next to General Weed.  And, like General Crawford, who led the charge of his Pennsylvania Reserves at the end of the battle to clear the ground so that further sniping wouldn't kill Union officers.  They are all there, and put together in a very readable story.  This is why I highly recommend this book.	2005-07-16

Lou Gehrig is someone that we all can aspire to and emulate.  The book relates it all: his reserved character, his great baseball records and clutch hitting, and his experience with ALS.  It is all here.  Although I've read and seen and heard many examples of the \\"luckiest man\\" speech, this book does the best job that I've seen of sharing it - the background leading up to the day, Lou's humility during the speech and the results.  (He received more letters from fans reacting to that speech than ever before.)  Being a New York Yankee fan from way back in my youngster years, I was interested in reading about this great baseball hero.  And heroic he was - the number of times that he won World Series games and his clutch hitting resulted in World Series wins which are related in some detail, even on a batter by batter basis.  The fact that he was one of the best clutch hitters of all time  (just look at his number of RBIs and grand slam home runs).  This book is worth the read.  It is great to read about such a great man so that we can all try to emulate him.  After reading this book, I can truly say that Lou Gehrig was the greatest New York Yankee of all time.	2005-06-16

The author's words, defining that event, are a lot better than mine, direct, to the point, poignant, so I will use his.  \\"On the thirty-first day of December, in the year of their Lord, four hundred and six, by the Christian calendar, the peoples of Germania, the Alans, the Quadi, the Marcommani, the Siling and Asding Vandals, led by the their five kings, broke camp and crossed the ice at Moganticum.\\"  (Moganticum is the Roman name for Mainz, Germany.)    In all history books covering that period, this is considered a cataclysmic, major event leading up to the Fall of the Roman Empire, but something similar, not as well-written, is all that you will see in the history books.  This book fills in the gaps, with a very believable story written in the first person by the General who led the XX Legion (the last Roman legion from Britain), in the defense of that area from the peoples of Germania.  Yes, we really don't know what happened during that event, but this story is very believable and very poignant.  You feel like you are there at General Maximus' side, as he shares his experiences of what occurred leading up that event as he tried to get the Roman citizens of the area prepared.  And, you feel like you are there at General Maximus' side, as he shares what transpired after December 31, 406.  Beautifully, well-written historical fiction is the result about an event that had historical impact in a very believable manner.  Only a couple of books reach this level (e.g. The Killer Angels).  This is one of them.	2005-05-08

Having worked 15 years in this field making this change happen and improving productivity (no really improve it), I can tell you that Michael Kennedy is on target.  And, no, it isn't complex centralized task management processes and detailed centralized resource planning systems that require small armies of program management office bureaucrats put in place to control people.  It is the people themselves.  It is their knowledge and the use of the right process and tools that enables that knowledge that really counts.  Personally, with all the junk out there today on controls systems, centralized project management, resource management and other approaches, and after being at another conference preaching this junk in the Pharmaceuctical industry (and where is their productivity at?)  And recognizing that this junk really doesn't work, it is great to read a book that shows what does work.  If you want your organization to really be successful in product development (no really successful in product development), don't read and listen to the junk coming out of PMI and the related consultants that purport to have the solution, which has no proof that it works in product development (only in the construction industry), read this instead.  And, then work hard to make it happen in your company, with patience and perseverance - the right stuff!	2005-04-14
US	52748267	R18NJRQ6NCBRM8	006073499X	711613781	The Scourge of God	Books	5	30	30	N	Y	Well written book on Attila, Aetius and Rome	This is a well written book on Attila and Aetius and Rome.  The writer creates the story from the perspective of an individual named Jonas who is sent to Attila as an ambassador and his experiences living with the Huns, and afterwards including the battle of Maurican plain.  The writing style is quick, short sentences with numerous changes in plot resulting in continual excitement wondering what will happen next to Jonas.  The images painted about the different protoganists are also very realistic:   - images of Attila, a brutal, violent individual who was somewhat neurotic;   - images of the Huns, who murdered and treated others with cruelty,   - images of the Romans, with the decadence of a declining, rotting empire with graft and corruption from officials and a military in significant decline;  - images of the Visigoths who reminded me of the Rohan knights from Lord of the Rings (in fact some believe that the Lord of the Rings was written from the apocayptic story of 451AD);  - images of Aetius, a Roman with integrity and honor trying to keep a dying empire together;  and other images providing a very realistic perspective on what happened in 451AD.  The realism of the story was shown in other ways also.  The author painted a realistic picture of the look of a Roman soldier, the Visigoth knight, the Frankish soldier, the Hun and all the protoganists of that period.  The author did not get into the numbers game on how many soldiers were involved in the battle (although he discusses his believes in an ending section), just saying that there seemed to be \\"hundreds of thousands\\", and the Visigoth army was made of 10,000 men.  The story is so well written that it really doesn't have to harp about the numbers of men involved.  Even the idea of storekeepers in the Roman army and runaway slaves in the Hun army swelling the numbers made sense.  Although the ending did not make much sense, but that time, I was drawn into the book and accepted it.  This is a well-written and well researched book and well worth the purchase.	2005-04-01

I have purchased all three of them and will provide my opinion on them.  This is the first book for evaluation.  Although this book is a fast read and has some interesting spots, it is totally implausible.   Although this is fiction, it is stated that is based upon fact, as the author states that \\"this then is the Battle of Chalons\\".  Well, it's not, at least not for me.   It doesn't depict with any level of accuracy the Roman army of that period.  The Roman army at this time was not dressed in traditional legionnaire garb.  Any basic reference of that period would clearly advise that this is not accurate.  The actual dress of the Roman soldier on the 4th and 5th century is more like a early medieval knight as shown in many good sources on this subject.  The Roman army at this time was in major decline and this is not shown with any degree of accuracy.  It provides almost a comic book view of the Huns.  These were violent and brutal people.  Finally, the numbers provided for each side are absurd.  (Yes, they are!)  The Hun army at the time of the battle of the Catalaunian fields is referenced as being one million men.  Even the sources of the time, which are considered to be way too high, provide the number as between 300-700,000.  Terry Gore advises in his book, Neglected Heroes, that the accurate numbers were from 35,000-45,000 for each side (with the Romans and their allies outnumbering the Huns unlike what this book suggests), and Arther Ferrill in that great book, The Fall of the Roman Empire, the Military Explanation, references that the 300-700,000 men provided in the original sources are not accurate just indicators from these sources that this was a major battle.  Well, 35,000-45,000 men each is a major battle for that time.    In order to put some perspective on the numbers, his 500,000 Alammani are 15 times the numbers fought in the battle of Strasbourg.  His 250,000 Romans are 20 times the numbers fought in the battle of Strasbourg (100 years earlier when the Roman army was more powerful).  This number would have been more than any number of Romans who fought in a battle at any time prior to that, including the Civil Wars between Caesar and Pompey.  And, this was 25 years prior to the end of the empire.  I wouldn't make such an issue of this if the author didn't keep harping on the numbers.  But, his insistence on the numbers are just an indication of a poorly written book.	2005-03-21

It is clear that Mr. Perret does not know a whole lot about the Civil War, but does that mean he doesn't know about Lincoln?  On the contrary, I found this book to be interesting and enlightening on Lincoln and I've read other books on our greatest President.  Some of the interesting items that I learned from this book are as follows.  Lincoln saved numerous soldier's who deserted from firing squads and by executive decree he saved a lot of men from this fate.  He continually visited hospitals to talk to wounded soldiers.  His focus and concern was with the individual soldier, and visited the army to meet them and talk to them.  This book studied Lincoln not the Civil War.  And, the input on this Lincoln study was from the perspective of the Library of Congress.  So what if Mr. Perret didn't recognize that more than two regiments of sharpshooters beat the Confederates on July 2nd, 1863 at Gettysburg.  This isn't a history of the Civil War.  It is a historical telling of Lincoln's role in the Civil War.  More importantly, to me, it highlighted what a good man he was.  We were lucky to have him as President during this trying time.  If you are interested in learning about Lincoln, I recommend this book.  It is good at delving into his personality.  If you are interested in learning about the Civil War, don't read this book.  It is as simple as that.	2005-02-26

As the author mentions, this campaign to capture Vicksburg is a rather unknown period of the war and this is a good book on this campaign.  It has its plusses and its minuses.  On the positive side, it covers the campaign in detail with a number of human interest stories.  The experiences of the citizens and soldiers who lived in Vicksburg, e.g. living in caves, the casualties, the experiences of soldiers in the hospitals (for example, he goes through the procedure that a doctor used to remove a leg - interesting although somewhat gruesome but it highlights the suffering).  He is an apparent fan of Pemberton (although he recognizes his mistakes well) and not a fan of Joe Johnston (but I haven't found a Civil War writer who is...).  He covers them well and also the top Union generals: Grant, Sherman and McClernand, including Grant's supposed bouts with alcohol and the feud between McClernand and Grant.  This is a balanced coverage.  On the minuses side, I found myself getting confused at times about what was really happening.  For example, the coverage of the battles including the maps which are very confusing, which ramble about this unit and that unit going this way and that.  The early book with this Confederate general and that Confederate general doing this and that is also confusing and may cause you to get you to get frustrated with the book, but stick with it.  At one point, he has Pemberton in Vicksburg and needing to go to Vicksburg in the same paragraph.  So, I read it again, and... huh.  But then the story picks up when Grant tries one approach versus another to reach Vicksburg and decides on approaching it from the South.  This is very interesting showing the chess moves between Grant, Pemberton and Johnston which Grant ultimately won.  This is a good book, on a period that should be covered more.  It may be confusing because unlike Gettysburg, where each writer can read the other books and build on them, there are few sources.  So, I recommend it.	2005-02-18

He initially described the approach in a couple of excellent articles written in the late 1970s but this book, first written in the late 1980s and updated twice since, is really the best source for the stage-gate process. Although his writing can be dry and his tone preachy, you can't argue with the base information and the conclusions. He studied 3000 new products in hundreds of companies to identify what separates the winners from the losers in new products, and stage-gates are one of the keys, along with cross-functional teams and a clear understanding of the customer's needs.  Today over 96% of companies in a recent survey use stage-gates, and the best at bringing new products to market, the organizations that are the most profitable and growing the fastest, do it well.  This book lays out how to do it well.  If you want to install a stage-gate process, and you need to, if your company doesn't have one, this is your best source.	2005-02-09

It is balanced - giving the perspective of the bomber crews, the US fighter pilots, the German defending pilots and the German antiaircraft crews and even the civilians.  This is certainly hard given the obvious tendency to want to tell the story from the Allies side, but by doing that, it gives a better perspective. <br />For example, it tells how the German pilots approached the bombers from the front and even gives examples of what a B-17 would like from different distances.  This shows how difficult it was for our boys to defend themselves.  From the front, a German fighter pilot would target the cockpit with a 20mm cannon that had a longer range than the 50 caliber machine guns, and with good aiming... well.  It told the results of that too.  But, then it told the results of the US fighter pilots bouncing the German fighters and shooting them down right before or after the Germans attacked our bombers.  Then, in those rare instances, where someone survived and wanted to talk about it, the book provides their experiences.  The story of the \\"bloody 100th\\" bomb group for example which experienced terrible casualities in this mission.  Finally, it gives a balanced perspective of the results: the Germans won the tactical battle but lost strategically.  The next day and the next day and the next day, the US bombers kept coming back.  Which really highlights how we won this portion of WWII and in reality the war - through persistence and courage.  Again, after (and during) reading this book, it gave me pause to think about what they did for us.  Thank you to all veterans of WWII.	2005-02-06

The only book that is close is Trudeau's more organized book on the battle.  But, what this book lacks in organization, it more than makes up in human interest stories and in just plain generating interest level in the story.  Sears is a good writer, a somewhat poetic and passionate writer.  Examples are: the best chapter title of: \\"A Simile of Hell Broke Lose\\", the numerous positive names for Hancock, emphasizing his great leadership and his presence.  (Yes, as one critic mentions, Sears is biased but towards the better Generals and leaders).  The human interest stories are there: like the deaths of three brothers named Thomas in a South Carolina regiment in the Wheatfield, the two men from a Pennsylvania regiment who won the medal of honor because they carried their comrade to safety (who later died), and the deaths of Weed and Hazlett who were close prior to the battle and died next to each other.  The prose is very powerful, poetic, and leads you to want to continue with the story.  Also, the details are covered like Trudeau but in a less organized way (who can beat chapters and maps based upon time of day for organization).  The story is down to the regiment level and chronicled based upon the right timing and location but not in as structured a way.  Consequently, I found myself drawn into a story.  And, what a story it is.  Sears tells with feeling and beautiful, poetic prose.  When Sears book first showed on the market, I had just finished Trudeau, and thought, this can not be better.  But, it is.  A well written book for a most important event in our history.	2005-01-26

The only other book on this battle that compares favorably to this one is Sears book which was published at the same time.  I like this book for the following reasons.  (1) It is very well organized.  The book is structured based upon time of day.  Past books on Gettysburg, e.g. Coddington and Pfanz, don't do anywhere near as good a job, in my opinion in organizing what was essentially a very confusing battle.  The battle was especially confusing on the second day, July 2nd, and Trudeau handles this very well by presenting the different geographical regions on time of day basis.  Also, this is supported with excellent maps that also show the time of the day.  So, at 5:45pm, at one point you'll be on Little Round Top with the 20th Maine, then he'll move to the west side of Little Round Top with 140th New York and then he'll move to the Wheatfield with Irish Brigade.  It gave me a sense of being there seeing it all transpire at the same time.  Well organized.  Of course, some may find this to be a jumbled approach.  But, I find it to be a very interesting way of sharing what happened on a minute by minute basis all over a very confusing battlefield.  (2) This book gets down to the brigade and regiment level and does an excellent job of it.  There is probably too much slant to the Union side (Sears is more balanced) but there is coverage of all the units, not just the 20th Maine, the 1st Minnesota and a couple of other popular units (e.g. 2nd, 6th and 7th Wisconsin of the Iron Brigade). <br />So, if you want a well organized book, organizing the battle on a time of day basis, with excellent maps, and going down to the regiment level, this is it.  I find myself going back to this book for just these reasons time and time again, as an excellent reference.  I highly recommend it.	2005-01-25

It is also a very good book.  But, it is not the best.  In my opinion, Sears' and Trudea's books are better.  As stated in the title, this book is a study in command.  So, that is what it focuses on, the commanders of the battle, the different generals and how they responded.  In the process, Coddington does a good job of covering the battle.  However, at times, I find this book to be confusing, especially during the afternoon of July 2nd.  In fact, in late 1980s when Pfanz' book on the 2nd day came out, it was refreshing because, to me, it provided some clarity around this confusion.  Further, the book really doesn't get down to the regiment level of the battle like Sears and Trudeau do.  Yes, the book covers the 20th Maine, and the 1st Minnesota, but that is about as far as it goes.  There isn't good coverage of the regiments and brigades even that fought in the Wheatfield example (even the Irish Brigade and Caldwell's other brigades are not given good coverage).  Nor is there good coverage of the attack of Weed's brigade and heroics of Paddy O'Rorke.  Yes, this is a good book but not the best.  Sears and Trudeau do a better job of coverage at the regiment and brigade level, and they are better organized.  For a single book on the Gettysburg battle, I recommend either of them over Coddington (to determine which one see my evaluations of those books for more on their coverage).	2005-01-25

First, I'll focus on the good elements of this book.  Then, highlight its' flaws. <br />Unlike the first book, there is a level of plausibility to it, except in a couple of instances which I'll highlight later.  The attempt to take Washington, DC and the capture of Baltimore are all represented in a believable manner.  Also, Lee doesn't come across as being infallible.  Second, the way that the book represents Lincoln, Grant along with Lee is very believable.  There are a couple of excellent scenes with Lincoln.  The one that will stay with me for awhile is when Lincoln is with the dying Confederate soldier (pages 123-125) and his presence right behind the line of soldiers during an attack, risking his life.  (There was a somewhat overly melodramatic scene after that with the 54th Massachusetts and Colonel Robert Shaw, the focus of the 1989 movie Glory, but I'll leave that to the reader so not to ruin the story.)  The discussion between Lee and the Rabbi in Baltimore is an interesting one also, very believable given Lee's known perspectives on slavery and how generals should handle politics.  These scenes and others make this a somewhat memorable book. <br />On the negative side, does Newt truly believe that Sickles was that stupid?  At the battle of Gunpowder River (interesting name, huh?, but there is actually a place with that name), Sickles is set up by Lee and he falls into it like a fool.  Maybe this was necessary to set up the battle between Grant and Lee which, by the way, doesn't come until the next book (hopefully).  Second, the bias towards the Confederacy continued at the end of the book.  Sickles losses his leg just like in Gettysburg.  But..., does Armistead die?  No, in spite of the fact that most of his command is destroyed.  Does Hood get wounded?  No, but he really isn't in the thick of it.  I suppose Newt tries to resolve this with what happens to one of the cavalry leaders of the Confederacy, but it doesn't seem plausible, at all (I'll leave it to the reader to determine which one).  In fact, Longstreet pulls his pistol and kills a Union soldier, when the Union infantry charges the Confederate line but doesn't get hurt, even scratched.  Are these guys, supermen, Newt? <br />Anyhow, in spite of all this, this book is a worthwhile read, although, due to the need to read Gettysburg first, it won't be as memorable as that great book, The Killer Angels.	2005-01-23

The author does a good job of researching his topic.  Although the writing is somewhat dry and to the point, there appears to be little truthful that can be said and this period is not well documented.  Some sections that I like especially where the early parts when about the Indian raiding that closed the roads in Colorado in 1865 and the fear that spread into Denver.  The section on the Connor campaign in August/September was also interesting.  Especially about the one unit attacked by thousands of Indians and the excerpts on Roman Nose who road in front of the soliders guns without getting touched.  Although this isn't a great book, it is an interesting book and one worth looking at if you are interested in the Indian wars in the west.	2005-01-20

The action on Prospect Hill was especially handled well detailing what happened to Meade's and Gibbon's Union Army Divisions and why they broke the line.  I never recognized until reading this book, how close the Union Army was to winning this battle, if only reserves were provided in a timely fashion, and if only this action was started earlier.  And, the reason why is astounding - Burnside couldn't make up his mind what to do until morning while his generals on that flank waited, and waited and waited. <br />And, the attack on Marye's Heights is also covered - one division after another going up the hill to get slaughtered (as shown so well in the movie Gods and Generals). <br />And, Burnside really didn't want to emphasize this part of the battle - he wanted to emphasize the Prospect Heights part - but didn't push it. <br />It clearly highlights the inadequate generals on the Union side and the sacrifice that the Union soldiers made.	2005-01-20

It covers all the major elements of the battle, and goes through some interesting anecdotes on the battle and the area.  Like the story of Generals Barlow and Gordon, Sallie the dog, John Burns, the oldest combatant at Gettysburg, Amos Humiston, etc..<br />I like the pages on General Longstreet and his new monument erected in 1998.  This is one of the high points of the book.<br />Of course, there are also many pages on Colonel Chamberlain and 20th Maine.  But, then, other important regiments are covered like the 1st Minnesota (that lost 82% of the their ranks in a doomed charge to save the day) or the 140 New York, and Paddy O'Rorke, who came to save the day on the other side of Little Round Top from the 20th Maine. Paddy O'Rorke was killed in this action.<br />Then there is the beautiful scene of the Irish Brigade and the Father Colby who gave them absolution before the battle.  The Irish Brigade played a key role in stopping the Confederates in the Wheatfield.<br />These stories are very readable tied to a trip around the battlefield and connected to markers.<br />This is the best tour guide book that I've ever read on what is the most sacred ground on our soil.<br />I highly recommend it.	2005-01-19

Not by any sense is this story beliveable.  For this reason, I can't recommend this book.  And, this book has a strong bias towards the south and Lee, making him look like some sort of god.<br /><br />But first, let me highlight why the book is not plausible.<br /><br />First, Newt has us believe that Lee's army can march 35 miles in enemy territory without a warning from the populous that this is happening, all while the Union army could march less than half that disance to get to Union Mills first.  And, he writes this off, saying that Meade was getting many statements that the Rebels were here and there and everywhere.  I can see this happening in Virginia, but I'm sorry not in Pennsylvania.  Incredulous!<br /><br />Second, when Meade is brought news from Buford's courier that Longstreet's corps is in Taneytown and going for Union Mills (where the good defensible ground was at Pipe Creek) and all the Union supplies in Westminster, what does Meade do?  He vacillates.  And, when Hancock argues with him, he decides to call a council of his corps commanders, waisting six valuable hours of road time.  Just think, now really, what would have happened?  Hancock would have asked to take his corps to Westminster.  Meade, being a new commander, would have relented.  After all Hancock had done this before at Fredericksburg (see the movie Gods and Generals which is better than this book), and given the danger of (1) losing his supply center (2) having the Confederate army between him and Washington, DC, and (3) having the Confederate army capture the highly defensible ground at Pipe Creek (where he was planning to defend), and especially how Meade acted afterwards, why wouldn't he have relented?  Does Newt think that Meade was that stupid?<br /><br />However, if Meade had acted on this news from his best scouting General, Buford, by the way, who just saved the day prior to this, Hancock would have been in both Westminster, and Union Mills before Longstreet, and that would have ruined Newt's implausible story.  Hence - his bias.<br /><br />Third, when Meade finally relents and moves the Army of Potomac to Union Mills, he decides to attack, when more than half the Confederate army is on the hill and dug in, knowing full well that his chances of success are minimal.  Also, can't he read the maps like Lee?  Doesn't he see that Lee is poised at his flank in Taneytown to take Littletown and close the door trapping the Army of the Potomac in a Cannae battle.  But, to the keep the implausibility going, Newt has them attack at Pipe Creek, the ground that the Union generals looked at and noticed that no one would be able to crack.  Again, does Newt think that Meade was that stupid?<br /><br />Now for the bias - Newt's love of Lee bias.  Buford gets killed (yes he does) from a cannonade of a couple of batteries.  All of the generals of the Army of the Potomac but Sickles and Hunt are either killed or captured.  But... Lee and Longstreet are in the open, while a cannonade of 230 cannons from the Union army explodes around them, wounding and killing people around them.  Do they get killed or hurt?  No.<br /><br />And then there is the Longstreet and Lee story - the enduring story about Gettysburg brought out so well in a great book, not a poor book like this one on Gettysburg - but a great book, The Killer Angels.<br /><br />Hey, Newt, Lee did not come up with the idea to do a turning movement and then find defensible ground to get the Union army to attack, be accurate and read some history.  Get your facts, right!  Longstreet suggested this - see all the credible history books on this.  No, Newt, Longstreet did not suggest a turning attack on the flank, but a great move around 35 miles. However, of course, Newt rewrites the facts so that he can make Lee look like a god.<br /><br />But, then again, the flanking wouldn't have worked, because Hancock would have been in Westminster first and theConfederate army would have been destroyed in detail, when Sickles attacked their retreating troops like he suggested.<br /><br />Which, I suppose is why Lee was right in attacking at Gettysburg, and the only redeeming quality of this book.  The book's story is so implausible that you recognize the Lee in fact did what he had to do - to attack and dislodge the Union army.  He thought this out, recognized that the Union army had the center line of axis due to the roads, didn't have stupid generals, and would be warned by the populace.<br /><br />So, Lee attacked.  Why?  Because if he did what Longstreet suggested, his army would have been destroyed.<br /><br />When you get all the facts straight, the battle of Gettysburg was set on the first day when Buford forced the Confederates to attack them, held them until Reynolds came up and then the Union held the high ground.<br /><br />Sorry, Newt, although an interesting read, your alternative is implausible.in detail, when Sickles attacked their retreating troops like he suggested. <br />Which, I suppose is why Lee was right in attacking at Gettysburg, and the only redeeming quality of this book.

It tells the story of the Omaha Beach landings on D-Day, June 6, 1944 from the perspective of the people who were there.  Primary sources tell the experiences of the first wave of soldiers and the surprises that they experienced when the enemy strongpoints were not eliminated.  It tells their experiences as they improvised from the original plan from going through the draws to going up the bluffs.  The unit stories are riveting, the 2nd Rangers, C Company (Saving Private Ryan?) as they landed on Dog Green and went up the bluff. The 5th and 2nd Rangers between Vierville and Colleville going up the bluff to attack Vierville from the east.  The 16th Regiment, Company C and others also going up the bluff to attack Colleville and other towns.  Then there are the human interest stories about the priest going amongst the wounded on the beach while under machine gun and mortar fire.  I couldn't put this book down.  What they did for us to keep us free brings tears to my eyes now as I write this.	2004-08-24

I was expecting a book that was biased in one direction or the other regarding Wyatt Earp, because that appears to be the norm.  However, this writer told both sides of the story: both the good and the bad.  And, ultimately, Wyatt Earp comes out as a real person with all his flaws.  However, he also comes out as a true American hero who represented law and order the only way he knew in a part of the country that had crooked sheriffs and political gamesmanship.  I really enjoyed this book.  I wish that this author would do the same sort of impeccable research on other old west icons.	2004-08-09

It tells the story of a man on the dodge, Tom McLean, who has committed crimes.  But, in spite of that, I developed a feeling for him, that... well, I hoped that he does escape to live his dreams of being free from the life that he made for himself.<br />In spite of his life of crime, Tom does have some redeeming characteristices.  He fights for what is right many times in the book, fighting the evil that exists in the group of crooks that he has to join to get away to his dream of freedom.  He is a complex character, and you continually wonder why he turned into the person that he did.<br />I found myself not being able to put this book down due to this complexity in the main character and in the beauty of the writing and the plot twists.  The descriptions of the country that he travels, the Bighorn mountains of Wyoming are beautiful.  Because of this, I'm looking forward to travel there over the summer.<br />Kirby Jonas, keep up the good work.  I'm one of your fans.	2004-04-25

Traditional project management approaches do a lousy job of solving this. For example, although traditional PERT was developed to do this, it is not used. (In fact, in most environments PERT is not defined as the tool but as a network diagram because of this.) Finally, there is an effective approach to proactively dealing with inaccuracy in estimates. The critical chain approach can accomplish this, and this is the best book for defining what critical chain is.	2001-09-19

Chapters 10 and 11 have the best approach that I've read recently on managing innovation projects. In Chapter 10, Discovery driven planning, and its approach of identifying and managing the assumptions behind an innovation project is very powerful.  This is much more powerful than the traditional construction based approach to project management.  In Chapter 11, the authors present a better approach to evaluating project progress based upon surveys.  This is much more powerful than the traditional project management approach of earned value, which frankly does not work here and generates a ton of non-value added effort.  If you are a project manager and you work in innovation/new product development, I highly recommend that you buy this book.  Then determine how to use it in your organization.	2001-08-04

This shouldn't be a surprise though since Mickey Rosenau understands project management practice in the field of product development. Beware of the other authors who claim that they understand product development and then apply a traditional approach to project management.  Project management in product development is different, and a traditional approach to project management doesn't work in product development.
