I much prefer a good thriller. However, Tapply and Brady Coyne are the exception to my rule.<br /><br />Nervous Water is another entry into the Coyne series.  I am never sure if I just really like Tapply's writing or if I just really like the character her created.  Regardless, this book is another wonderful Brady Coyne story.<br /><br />What makes these books so great is that Tapply has given his characters \\"real life\\" traits.  They fight, make mistakes and work their way through the storylines at such a delightful and real pace that you can almost feel that they are real.<br /><br />Nervous Water explores deep-rooted family issues intermingled with legal and personal issues.  At the same time, being entertaining and a page turner.<br /><br />I am not sure about the relationship between our main character and his \\"love\\".  I always kind of feel that this does not work for Coyne and he should be single for a while.<br /><br />Also, I do find it difficult to plod through all the fishing references made (and there are alot in this one). I know that Tapply is a fishing enthusiast, but I would love for him to figure out that there is a really good chance that most of his fans ARE NOT and that is why I give this book 4 instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />Otherwise. Another perfect read.	2005-09-30

He has a way of writing that keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />However, the Last Victim just did not hit the mark at all.  The storyline itself (twins - one running for office - the other going around trying to make things all better) is boring.  Yep, O'Brien has committed the ultimate sin.  He wrote a BORING thriller.<br /><br />Last Victim just does not feel as though it gets off the ground at all.  There are just pages and pages of pointless dialogue and I just could not get into liking any of the main characters.  The sister was supposed to be \\"strong female\\" lead and really her role ended up being more that of \\"house cleaner and making sure all is perfect\\" for her almost famous brother.<br /><br />O'Brien's previous book left me cold also.  I am worried that this is becoming his new writing style.  Bring back the old style please.	2005-09-13

Hard to explain, but usually very intereting and fun read.<br /><br />Now comes Perfect Nightmare.  Uh! what happened?  The book is slow to the extreme and the main characters are not likeable in the least - which would be great if they were interesting.  Lindsay is so whiny that I wanted to smack her upside the head a few thousand times.  The whole family dynamics did not work.<br /><br />However the more horrific part is that this story was just not very scary or enjoyable in anyway.  No suspense, no dread feeliing - nothing.<br /><br />Pass on this one. I think John Saul missed the mark big time -0	2005-09-01

I love this comic strip and absolutely every book in this series is excellent.<br /><br />The whole gang is back (although we don't see Peter's girlfriend or Eileen in these)and as always, they are funny and inspired.<br /><br />Once again, I have to comment on the extremely small size of the book.

Unfortunately, this latest entry falls far from the mark.<br /><br />Cunnah usually has a way of writing her scenes that make them funny and interesting.  This is not the case with this book. The opening scene is a good example.<br /><br />Cunnah starts off with a funny premise and then goes on and on and on and insists in describing it in minute to minute detail at which point it just becomes boring.<br /><br />We get that the boss is a jerk and we get that our main character is going to have to be the poor suffering soul among all the kiss ups.  But for some reason, Cunnah just kept going page after page on ONE scene.<br /><br />It was too much and it basically set the tone, for me, for the rest of the book.<br /><br />I just could not get into this storyline.  It felt rehashed somehow and I did not really care about the ending.<br /><br />I guess every author is allowed one miss and Cunnah had hers with this one.	2005-08-26

Although aimed at teen audiences, I am an adult and I enjoyed this book (as I did the first one).<br /><br />The writing is fun and the storyline kind of plays into everyone's fantasy of getting away from it all for the summer and to play in the Hamptons.  Meet rich people and do exciting things that we would not normally get a chance to do.<br /><br />Having said this, if you are the type who needs to have a strong, solid, realistic storyline than DO NOT purchase this book. The Mara character especially is so unrealistic (everything she does is picture worthy and oh so, perfect) that you will want to gag.<br /><br />However, if you don't mind this than go ahead and read this one. I thoroughly enjoyed it and hope that there is a part trois sometime down the road.	2005-08-10

To the point where I vowed never to buy them again.<br /><br />But, I caved in with Undomestic Goddess (yes, I know its not a Shopaholic one) because the storyline sounded corny, but good.<br /><br />I am glad that I did.  While Kinsella, in my opinion, has a habit of going way over the top with both her characters personalities and the situation she puts them in, this book was truly fun to read.<br /><br />I think what really helped this book was the fact that,unlike Becky in Shopaholic, our main character is a strong, lead person who has a life of her own.  Who does not expect to go along her merry little way and have everyone around her just gravitate naturally to her - despite her obvious character flaws.<br /><br />The storyline is actually interesting and kept me wanting to know more about our main character.<br /><br />Of course, once Samantha goes through her \\"office\\" phase, the storyline gets extremely corny and hard to swallow, but somehow, in this instance, the author pulled it off for me.	2005-07-28

There are very short bits of suspense, but overall, the writing is slow and sluggish and frankly, I miss Paul alot.

Abby, our main character has been exposed all her life to weddings and now, she is trying to avoid being a bridesmaid for her sister.<br /><br />Needless to say, this is so not going to happen.<br /><br />I enjoyed this story.  It is sweet and innocent, but not overly sweetly.

It felt to me that the genre could use some new blood.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this story did absolutely nothing for me.  The author basically has two concurrent storylines going on at the same time and for the longest time, the two don't blend.  Actually, it took forever for them to merge and by then, you can't really care about either of them.<br /><br />The writing style was ok, but that's about the best I can say about this one.

This one is an extremely heavy hitter.  I found myself taking deep breaths between chapters.<br /><br />The story of Lynn and her *love* of E is frank and extremely graphic.  She made me feel as though I was right there with her during her harshest experiences.<br /><br />It is so scary to see how easily we can fall into the trap of addiction and Lynn makes mention of this quite frequently in her memoir.<br /><br />What sets this one apart though is that Lynn apparently still had quite lucid moments during her trips.  She frequently mentions, during her heaviest uses, how unhappy she was even during the middle of her E trips.<br /><br />I loved this book.

The \\"bad guy\\" of the story uses this to infiltrate himself into the Dr's life and cauze huge problems.<br /><br />While I did not hate this book, I really never got into it.  The author has a habit of starting off a chapter in a promising way, then lapses into philosophical debates with his own characters.  The result of this, of course, being that any suspense that may have been growing immediately comes to a halt.<br /><br />I like my thrillers to be straight.  No waxing poetic.  This book has way too much of it.<br /><br />You get to a point where you can't care about the storyline cauz it is so entertwined with esoterical questions and views.<br /><br />Unfortunatley, this book was kind of plain boring.	2005-06-02

I have enjoyed all of them immensely and this latest entry is no exception.<br /><br />The author has a way of writing Alice in an utterly charming and totally real teen-angst way.<br /><br />What marks these books from others is that the author intervenes subtle humor that takes off the hard edge from some of the storyline.  So, you get the \\"point\\" of the story without the downer side of it.<br /><br />Alice is a typical teenager -slightly out of tune with her reality (typical teen) and you find yourself rooting for her.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the parents don't play major support roles in these books, but that is a small criticism.<br /><br />This is a great series for any teen.<br /><br />I highly recommend them.	2005-05-28

US	51315280	R3ECQ2LVRH004C	0451411846	565170239	Before I Wake	Books	4	25	25	N	N	Spooky	This thriller features a former FBI profiler.  She is no longer in the business because a few years ago, while attempting to locate a killer - she was talked into undergoing scientific experiences in which she was dunked into a tank for days on end and forced to \\"get\\" into the mind of the killer via sensory deprivation and other means.  In the process, the killer found out and killed her family - or did he?<br /><br />Now, she is out of retirement and returns to the site where these experiences where conducted because there have been more murders.<br /><br />This book is spooky.  From the cover of the book which features a desolate looking asylum to the description (very well done by the author) of the interior of the institution (read asylum) the author does a wonderful job of making you feel as though you see the abandoned cafeteria, the holding areas for the former \\"subjects\\" and all the spooky stuff still around.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book.  The characters were interesting as you were never sure if they were the good guys or not.<br /><br />The one complaint I have is that the atuhor, at one point, chooses to remove  the characters from the asylum and transports them off the \\"Hill\\".  I feel as though the book lost a little bit of its appeal at this point.  She definitely should have written the entire story within the grounds.<br /><br />Still, a solid thriller with alot of detours and you won't really be able to figure out the ending on your own.<br /><br />A good investment.	2005-05-02

I do, however, wonder about his knowledge of the Traditions which talk about anonymity in the media and the press. I am pretty sure having your pictures and full name on the cover of the book may be a breach of anonymity.<br /><br />Still, I appreciate his total honesty.

The storyline is about two couples who meet in prenatal classes and the story of what happens to their relationships when their children are born.<br /><br />The whole storyline is farfetched and completely unrealistic. Particularly when we read about Jake and his wife Alice.  Jake has become obsessed about living a frugal lifestyle to the point where he expects his wife to recycle toilet paper (and other stuff)  We discover that he is not capable of being a good husband and father.<br /><br />The other couple Hugo and Amanda are polar opposites from Jake and Alice, but these two also have a horrible relationship and the author overdoes it with the Amanda character big time.<br /><br />You just know that somehow, these couples will not remain together but you can see the end a mile away.<br /><br />There is nothing new here.  The storyline is cute if not ridiculous and if you can hold your disbelief, then buy this book.  If you are the kind of reader who likes your storyline to be realistic then stay very far away from this one.	2005-04-26

The last few of them have left me blah and this one is no exception.<br /><br />While I had enjoyed this author's previous works, this book does not work on many different levels.<br /><br />Basically 3 friends grow up together and more or less have a crush on the same guy. Only one of them ends up with him, but one of the other girls, who is now an adult is still very much in love with him.<br /><br />For one thing, the author does not really do a good job of explaining why this guy is so special.  Why he would warrant a crush of over 20 years.<br /><br />Additionally, I had some reservations about all of the characters.  They all seem to have their own agenda and gave the book a weird feeling.<br /><br />The ending is also weird as there are gender issues involved that don't mesh at all.<br /><br />Don't buy this book.  It just does not work in too many ways.	2005-04-24

Would it not have worked way better as non-fiction? It was my belief that this book was based on the author's personal experiences.<br /><br />Yes, it would have been a little dicey to make it non fiction, but certainly lots more fun.<br /><br />As it stands, this book is full of stories about \\"make believe\\" stars.  The author has our main character jumping from one star to the other without much coordination and throughout the whole thing, we are also subjected to silly comments from the main character.<br /><br />Also, are we expected to believe that the \\"star assistant\\" works for all these people and does not even have contracts with any of them? Smacks of plot advancement to me.<br /><br />Overall, unfortunately, this book was boring for me.

The author manages to really involve us in the storyline of this couple who are somewhat desperately attempting to have a baby.<br /><br />However, the author needs to make her main character (Emma) a heck of a lot less annoying.  Although I felt for Emma and her hubby not being able to conceive, the author managed to make me extremely dislike Emma.<br /><br />Emma was portrayed as increasingly infantile and I kept expecting her to start stamping her foot and holding her breath until the powers that be gave her what she wanted.<br /><br />I think if I had been her hubby or family, I would have smacked her. This removed alot of the pleasure of this book for me, hence the 3 stars.<br /><br />I think there would have been a few other ways to explain Emma's frustration without making her so annoying.<br /><br />Still, I would consider reading the next novel by this author.	2005-04-21

I ended up feeling extremely sorry for the kids and very mad at Michelle for getting herself into this situation.  I kept thinking that she managed to bring woman back to the dark ages quite easily.  During the first part of the book, I kept thinking \\"how hard is it not to keep having babies\\".<br /><br />Michelle really seemed like a total doormat and I felt for the kids.<br /><br />However, I must give her huge credit for never giving up and always remembering her most  important responsibility was to her kids.<br /><br />As for the writing itself.

The author gives attention to details but does not go on and on for no reason.<br /><br />The characters and the storyline were interesting and the pacing was good.  However, for some reason I figured out who \\"done it\\" almost immediately.  I am not sure if this is because of my superb deduction skills (doubtful) or because the storyline and plot were just not as tight as they may have been.<br /><br />I kind of got the impression this has been done and done and done before.<br /><br />Not a bad read, but it wasn't particularly fun as I knew the ending by page 50.	2005-04-13

On the way home, on their bikes, a motorist with road rage deliberately rams them with his car and kills the girlfriend.  While Rob tries to convince police that the motorist (a prominent attorney) deliberately killed his girlfriend, the killer gets off with no jail time.<br /><br />This freaks out Rob who can't let go of the murder.  During all of this, a mysterious person introduces himself and asks Rob to join \\"the Circle\\".  Basically, 10 people wearing mask meet in a room.  They all have in common on thing - they want revenge agains a person who killed their loved ones.<br /><br />This thriller is actually a very clever premise.  i.e. you can't kill your fiance's murderer because you will be an automatic suspect, BUT you can get someone else to do it and then you can return the favor.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the storyline.  You feel for the main character Rob and you even feel for the other characters (who are never truly fleshed out all that much).  There is also a very clever turn in this storyline that you may not see coming.<br /><br />The writing is good although the author tends to go on and on about small details.  However, the suspense is there and I found myself leafing through the pages at an alarming rate - dying to see the story unfold.<br /><br />Excellent purchase.	2005-04-09

I absolutely loved the author's previous book.<br /><br />The premise of this book is that our main character Natalie feels as though she does not have a life. She has just moved \\"to the big city\\" and is living in a small apartment which use to belong to someone else - this person apparently had quite a social life as Natalie keeps getting continuous phone calls and letters for this now departed person.<br /><br />Of course, this only serves to make Natalie feel like more and more of a failure, because she never gets calls or any interesting mail.<br /><br />Through the course of the early pages of the book, Natalie gets an interesting letter addressed to the previous owner.  As Natalie's self-esteem becomes lower and lower (and after a night of heavy drinking), she decides to open this letter and POOFF!! she hooks up with the man of her dreams. Except Natalie is now impersonating someone else.<br /><br />This book was ok, however, it had such a sad overtone to it that I just could not get into it with halfway as much relish as with \\"When in Rome\\".<br /><br />Additionally, the whole \\"imitating someone else\\" thing got old very early on in this book.  The author expects us to believe that the people in Natalie's life will all \\"play along\\" with her of-so-funny deception.<br /><br />I am also very disconcerted by the fact that this story is not that funny. The author's previous work was quite funny at times and made up for some of the more \\"cheesy\\"  moments, but this book is just not that good.<br /><br />Also, the end is so predictable.  I won't ruin the ending for anyone, but let's just say it stretches the limits of reality quite a bit.<br /><br />Actually, that is my biggest problem with this book. ITS JUST TOO UNREAL.<br /><br />Not a great one.	2005-03-29

He is appointed (by a narrow margin) as CEO of the large company after the previous CEO is murdered.<br /><br />This is pretty basic stuff for a Frey novel.<br /><br />I have not really enjoyed Frey's last novels.  This one is another example.<br /><br />While there is nothing hugely wrong with the book, the writing feels cold and extremely formal to me.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, the storyline is based almost entirely in the corporate world. By this I mean that we see very little of ANY of the private side of any of the characters.  Specifically, the scenes written for Christian are almost always inside the office headquarters - giving us absolutely no chance to \\"like\\" or \\"understand\\" this character at all. He is written coldly and there is always a distance between the reader and the characters of the book - this is difficult to explain.<br /><br />The plot and storyline are ok and there are a few holes in them (not enough to remove from the overall effect) however, since I never felt invested in the characters, I really did not care all that much about what happens in the end.<br /><br />Frey sort of misses the mark on this one.	2005-03-29

Its hard to believe that anyone would tolerate these types for very long - so this makes the story a bit of a stretch for me.<br /><br />However, I enjoy the relationship between Al and August (this kid is going to need therapy) and even Al's friends are interesting and play a semi-important role in the book.  The character of Spence feels as though he just \\"appears\\" in the story and then pops out and in again. This character did not feel fleshed out properly to me.<br /><br />The writer has an engaging writing style and the story is fun although it is far from deep.<br /><br />The character of Al is truly a doormat (as one of her friends points out to her) and this kind of removes some of the pleasure of reading this for me. I would have liked to see Al with more backbone - but then again, this book would not be possible if Al was written in this manner.<br /><br />Overall, a very good choice.	2005-03-23

EVERYTHING she does is about her weight.<br /><br />The storyline is well written if a little cutesy at times and we genuinely like Kat.<br /><br />Of course this story also touches a chord with all women - because it deals with body image and more specifically romance and worldview of weight.<br /><br />My only slight negative would be that Kat is written a little too wishy-washy.  This, in my opinion, is often the case in chick lit.  I would have wanted her to pick her battles a little better.<br /><br />Still, this novel about love, weight, weight and oh yeah! weight ..... is a great read.	2005-03-19

If I had found my teenage daughter reading this, I would have been upset.<br /><br />The basic storyline of three girls looking for love is not new. However, what is new is that they are 15 and 16 years old and while they are not portrayed as delinquents, the author gives them no life at all except when it comes to parties, booze and sex.<br /><br />These girl spend the entire book drinking beer (when did this become ok at 15?) they keep trying to make out with older guys (I thought this was illegal) and through all of this, while there is mention of parents, NONE of them are even remotely important to the plot.  These issues seem to be treated as a mere means to a result (to get the guy to like them).<br /><br />I am not that old that I don't know what is going on with the teens today, however, do I want to hand them over books that promote this kind of behaviour. NOPE.<br /><br />There are many, many teen books out there that explore these very same subject matters in a much more enlightened way. Buy those and skip this one.	2005-03-16

However, like many other reviewers, I had mixed feelings about both the book and the author not to mention the technique used.<br /><br />Eating disorders are horrible, cunning and extremely sneaky things.<br /><br />I could really sympathize with what this family went through. I admire the fact that the mother cared enough to get invloved and to be willing to participate in the recovering process.<br /><br />Having said that, I did not like this mother one little bit. For one thing, she somehow managed to make this book more about her than about her anorexic daughter.  Secondly, it sounds to me as though she was really the one pushing for all this, that the rest of the family kind of just went along with whatever \\"mom\\" said. You tend to get the impression this is one lady who is used to getting her own way - some in recovery may call this a character defect. As a matter of fact, when reading the book, the author often refers to herself as \\"the mother\\" - as though this made her extremely special somehow.<br /><br />I actually wholeheartedly agree that addiction is not a choice and it is totally unfair to always automatically blame the families. However, I got the chills when reading this book - this is one mother with control issues.<br /><br />On the other hand, if my daughter was in this position, I may very well do the same thing.<br /><br />The author has mentioned that she takes some kind of weird pride in people saying negative things about her views.  This only proves to me that this whole thing has become a way for the mother to be special.<br /><br />I hope that this author's method has truly been beneficial for her daughter. In the end, if it has not - the daughter will be the one to pay for it. Eating disorders never go away...	2005-03-12

However, once your main character decides to \\"try\\" to have sex (sort of )with the new guy in her life (sort of), the book and the storyline started feeling just like many standard chick lit books.<br /><br />Also, I am extremely skeptical of all the \\"coincidences\\" that just seem to happen to our main character.<br /><br />While this is not a horrible read, its really average.  Save yourself the money and get it at the local library.	2005-03-11
US	51315280	RZ05YAY9M1DLE	0892967919	49675541	Midas	Books	4	7	9	N	N	Very good	The last Russeell Andrews books have left me blah.<br /><br />However, in Midas, we finally find the kind of action that was noteworthy of Russell's first book.<br /><br />Midas is an honest to goodness thriller. Complete with small town sheriff (Justin Westwood is back), bombs and a wonderful whodunnit with conspiracy theories abound.<br /><br />This book was clearly written after 9/11 as you will find many direct references to terrorists, bombs and a general fear of the unknown.<br /><br />Russell has written an extremely tight storyline - the plot holds up and for the longest time, the storyline is written as though two separate chain of events are going on.<br /><br />I really enjoy the character of Justin Westwood and I absolutely loved the character of Bruno Pecozzi who is written in a complex - never sure if he is a good guy or not point of view.  I hope to see lots more interaction between these two in future books.<br /><br />My only negative.  Midas can get extremely technical at times. Lots of descriptions (in detail) of planes, bombs and even the financial aspects are extremely confusing.  So, be sure you are giving your 100% attention when you read this book or you will miss something that will, no doubt, be extremely important sometime down the storyline.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this one.	2005-03-11
US	51315280	RUX0T1PMMLSAO	0843955201	760131474	The Dead Stone	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Very good	I was not a fan of this author's previous book. I thought it was somewhat juvenile.<br /><br />Dead Stone came out and I thought I would give the author another try.<br /><br />I am glad that I did.  While the main character can be a little silly, I loved the whole plot line in this book.<br /><br />Her interaction with the townspeople (who do not realize she is \\"one of them\\") is priceless.  I especially liked her connection with Hank.<br /><br />The writing is somewhat basic, but the story is told at a fairly good pace and you end up really liking this book. The main character's relationship with her dog also adds to this book.<br /><br />Buy it.	2005-03-09

A great mixture of whoddunit that incorporates books, books and more books.<br /><br />While his previous book was a little slow, this book is a sure winner.<br /><br />It all starts with Cliff's lady-love asking him to investigate (unofficially) a case in which a friend from the past is accused of murder.<br /><br />As it turns out, Cliff finds more than he thought in the way of a house full of books which may or may not be worth a fortune.<br /><br />Dunning is wonderful at making his storyline grow in intensity. I found myself turning the pages at an alarming rate dying to find out more.<br /><br />This is a solid thriller with many, many turns and twists and you will not be able to figure out the ending.<br /><br />Absolutely wonderful read.	2005-03-05

There are lots and lots of good teen books out there.<br /><br />Dizzy is not bad.  It is basically the story of a 12 year old who gets to spend some time with her wayward mother and share some experiences with her.<br /><br />While the first half of the book was pretty good, the second hald kind of drags - especially when we get into the too many details of Storm's life.<br /><br />I don't especially like the Storm character very much and felt extremely sorry for Dizzy who can't ever seem to reconcile herself fully with the mother she was dealt.<br /><br />This is a fair book.	2005-03-03

It is indeed a misery to read through the beginning pages when our Lu basically thinks she has indigestion for 6 straight weeks.  She has had two other children  - so get a clue.<br /><br />Also, the relationship with Lu and her children - while written to be funny kind of made me sad.  This is a lady who does not know what it is to be close to people.<br /><br />Throughout the book - the author writes of her character \\"I will not cry\\" so many times that I wanted to scream \\"just do it already\\".<br /><br />While this is not horrible chick lit - its average and the book could have been cut by half - its way too long.<br /><br />If you want to read this, get it at your local library or used bookstore.  I am sorry that I bought it new and spent the money.	2005-03-03

She hasn't been there two minutes and yet insists on buying a home.  She of course, finds the \\"perfect\\" home but can't afford it - in rides the perfect real estate agent who finds her a loving home.  However,surprisingly not all is on the up and up as she will soon find out. (This turns out to be the only twist in this predictable story).<br /><br />Even her relationship with the next door neighboor (female) felt tedious to me.  Our main character \\"uses\\" the neighbors loneliness and makes her an instant babysitter to two somewhat annoying and quite bratty kids.<br /><br />This book was meant to be written as a heartwarming story of a suddenly single mother who needs to venture forth.  But it comes off as making the main character selfish and the whole storyline boring.<br /><br />This is definitely NOT chick lit material.  It should be considered more as general fiction.<br /><br />Even reading my review of this book bores me.  This is just basically too boring for more words - so I will stop.	2005-03-03

Had been expecting this book with great anticipation.<br /><br />Our two main characters - Morelli and Vanessa, both have deep, dark secrets that will eventually link them together.  But first, we have to do through endless pages of boring interactions (the relationship with Morelli and the kid was so sugary) that it makes you want to skip to the end of the book.<br /><br />Margolin's usual flow in the storyline practically does not exist in this book.  His transition from main characters (who are not even in the same geographical area for the longest time) is ackward and extremely drawn out.<br /><br />Although I did like the Morelli character, the Vanessa one left me cold.<br /><br />Margolin fills his novel up with too much detail and fluff and when he actually gets to the nitty-gritty, its boring.<br /><br />This one is a pass.	2005-03-02

She also happens to be one of the only students who is not blonde in this Florida high school.<br /><br />This book starts off with a bang.  By introducing the lead character into a new school, full of \\"Britney Spears\\" wannabes. You can actually imagine Annissa, short haired AND brunette (how dare she) trying to figure out how she is going to survive her year at the new school.<br /><br />She is pitted against these wannabes who are determined to make her life as difficult as possible.  On top of all that, they are part of the cheerleading squad that Annissa wants to join.<br /><br />What ensues is a bunch of exchanges between the parties and funny (sometimes not so funny) events and overall a great storyline.<br /><br />Mind you, the storyline has been DONE before, but it is well written and fun to read.<br /><br />I was really into it until about 3/4 of the book when things get horribly mushy and extremely predictable.  This, I did not care for so much.  The author could have made the ending a tad less predictable. Which would have added more depth to the book.<br /><br />Otherwise, it was a great read.	2005-02-27

While there was nothing wrong with the premise of the storyline and the nice little detours it took (just when you thought you had it figured out), I felt as though the main character (Sean) was kind of a farce in this book.<br /><br />He was far from being deep in any meaningful way and the wise-cracks did not ring true for me.<br /><br />The storyline was a nice touch though and had me guessing to the end.<br /><br />While I did not hate this book, it just was not as tight and engrossing as the previous Haig books.	2005-02-27

I enjoyed the basic premise of the book, but for me there are different levels of thriller.<br /><br />I would classify this one as \\"soft-thriller\\".  There are no real surprises, the main characters are all likeable and the main leads are always female and male who end up falling in love.<br /><br />While there is nothing really wrong with the storyline (serial children killer) the whole thing is deja vu at best and the writing style is kind of sugary.<br /><br />Average read.	2005-02-10

The big question looming for me while reading this book, \\"is she even going to survive all the alcohol she has fed her body\\".<br /><br />Zailckas has a way of writing her story without being overly dramatic although she does occasionally stray and start waxing a little poetic (this part I could have done withoutl) HOWEVER, she is extremely honest and doesn't spend alot of time preaching.<br /><br />Basically, she is saying \\"this is my story, I was stupid and while I can't say that I will never go there again, I am going to do my best not to\\".<br /><br />I got the impression that the author was still extremely fragile and I wanted to scream \\"WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS IN ALL THIS\\" - yes, they are present in the book, but it felt to me as though they were always on the sidelines - basically clueless or working hard at being clueless.<br /><br />An impressive piece of work. If you have a problem with alcohol or are in recovery now, read this book - its a winner.	2005-02-10

This book is a little gem of a look at women and how we view our bodies. The author starts off by saying \\"while there is a war in Iraq, I am worried about my tummy\\".<br /><br />For women who do not have image issues (all 3 of you) this book will seem silly, but for the rest of us who are oh-so conscious of our bodies and especially their faults, this book will hit home.<br /><br />A series of vignettes from various women, interwoven with Eve Ensler's comments and own views, this book is loaded with insight into how women think.<br /><br />My only negative.  It is way too short.	2005-02-09

Featuring two women (one single, one married) who are tired of their lives and want to \\"live it up\\".  Low and behold, one of them gets a cheque for one million dollars and they decide to go to New York to spend, spend, spend.<br /><br />This book is average at best.  There is one gigantic hole in the beginning. If my employer left a million dollar cheque for me on my desk, I would make darn sure that it wasn't a huge mistake.<br /><br />My first thought when I was reading the book was that the person making out the cheque thought it was for $1,000.00.  Through convoluted ways, we find out that yes, that was the case and that somebody else added a couple of zeros.  No matter,it seems obvious to me that the main character would have had the brains to confirm the amount with her employer.<br /><br />So, from there on, the book and the storyline fell apart for me.<br /><br />As well, these two main characters are so incredibly childish that they were huge turn offs.<br /><br />The writing style was also nothing to write home about.<br /><br />This is a pass.	2005-02-09

While this book may appeal to people \\"in the airline business\\", for me, as a layperson I found it to be one of the most boring books I have ever read.

US	51315280	RXEQL5MCB7C95	0765311410	38402791	The Majority Rules	Books	3	5	11	N	N	Different	This thriller is a difficult book to review.  It starts off with our main character being asked to take over the just recently vacated position of judge.  Apparently, the previous judge was murdered.  Tim did not get his position without a price and the price is that he has to \\"vote\\" a certain way in certain cases.<br /><br />This does not sit well with Tim and he enlists the help of a former lover to help him take down the whole thing.<br /><br />The storyline is great and the plot is logical and keeps you interested, but there was something about the whole tone of the book that just turned me off.  I think its the writing style. The whole book felt like it was written in a standoff, once removed voice. The whole writing style felt stilted to me.  It is difficult to explain, but I just felt as though the author was writing this book in the third person (even though it is only partly like that).<br /><br />A good read, but could have been deeper.	2005-02-03

It explores the area of espionnage with a twist.<br /><br />I love  Hardwick's down to earth and thoroughly readable style of writing.  I am not a huge fan of espionnage books, but Hardwick made me literally devour this book.  He writes humble and human characters and his plots are always a whodunnit til the end.<br /><br />I still prefer to read Hardwick's police stuff, but this book was a nice change of pace.<br /><br />Great, great.	2005-02-02
US	51315280	R25PQWP13TNZFC	076535084X	397807582	Pandemic	Books	4	18	20	N	N	Excellent debut novel	This thriller is about today's issues.  Dr. Noah Haldane is the head guy at the WHO and he has seen his share of scary epidemics. He firmly believes that we have yet to see the \\"big one\\". On the government side is Gwen.  She is convinced that the next wave of the epidemic will be brought in as a killing tool by terrorits.<br /><br />As it turns out - they are both right.<br /><br />Together our two main characters fly, basically, all over the map trying to track a new strain of the flu.  Think Smallpox, SARS and Spanish Flu and you have a good idea of the potency of this new potential epidemic.  In a bid against time, they try desperately to put the pieces together to avoid a worlwide contamination.<br /><br />This is a fantastic debut thriller from a Canadian author who happens to be a doctor.<br /><br />The writing is fresh  without too much details to unimportant things.  The characters are likeable and it is refreshing to see that both characters are smart.  While the Noah Haldane was more flushed out than the Gwen character, we do get a good feel for both of these people.<br /><br />The pace can be a little slow at times and if you are expecting action every page - you will be disappointed.  However, the story builds into a logical, strong plot.<br /><br />The author, I think, forgot that he was writing for an average layperson. Some of his technical terms need to be rephrased as I got a little confused on the medical terms (especially in the early part of the book - when we are still trying to absorb character names, etc.)  Also, the pace could be a tad faster. While the length of the book was fine, it did occassionally drag just a little bit.  Still, these minor complaints do not in any way overshadow the quality of this book.<br /><br />Other than that, the cast of characters (including Clayton) were wonderful and I give this a 4 star rating for a first time author.<br /><br />BUY IT.	2005-02-01

She is part of her very perfect cousin's (Helen) wedding. She even has to go to the bachelorette party.  This story focuses mainly on immediately before, during and right after the party.<br /><br />Full of surprises, especially from Helen herself, the storyline brings you full circle and the characters have all discovered some shocking secrets about themselves.<br /><br />This book is a winner.

Actual story is not.  I feel as though the writing is incredibly controlled and the whole plot just does not flow for me.  The main character is kind of on a constant whine and basically, this whole plot just does not work.<br /><br />It is incredibly difficult for me to write this as I am a HUGE Ben Kincaid fan.

I LOVED IT!<br /><br />The story of two friends - Voula and Jaimie.  Jaimie has always been the wild one, but now she is settled down and wants a child - badly.  This really rocks Voula's world as she is pretty sure that relationships and children are not in her future.  Can their friendship survive?<br /><br />While this book is written with an eye towards fun, it is actually a grown up read about sticking by your friends even if you don't see their point of view.  Its about loving the people in your life and its about figuring out how to be the best that you can be.<br /><br />While this may sound a little dramatic for a chick lit book, Papa manages to introduce all of these important issues in the storyline while conveying some of the funnier moments (and not so funny) about wanting to have a child.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book and thought it was an intelligent and \\"feel good\\" read.<br /><br />Buy it.	2005-01-26

McMahon usually tells much more interesting stories and this one kind of stalls at some points because of the limited storyline location.<br /><br />However, towards the middle to mid end of the book, the story picks up considerably and you can find vintage McMahon once again.<br /><br />So, I would rate this book as a 3 star thriller because of the strength of the writing and the end of the story.<br /><br />A fair read overall. McMahon is usually stronger than this. I consider this book to be his weakest in the series.	2005-01-26

The story is about a twentysomething woman who gets dumped by her husband for an older women.  So, the main character is left raising her young daughter by herself.<br /><br />The story is solely based on the interactions between our main character and her child - relative to the rest of the world.<br /><br />It works.  Its funny and because the storyline is unusual for chick lit, there are lots of stories to tell.  The writing is very well done and the book is kind of divided between the main characters.  Also, cute little diary entries, written by Zoe, the 6 year old girl are wonderful and kind of insightful.<br /><br />I think the only thing I don't like is that the author portrays Zoe as extremely spoiled and VERY whiny. Kind of irritating, but does not remove from the great story.<br /><br />Buy it.	2005-01-23

Fairstein's latest book is so basic that I had to double check to make sure it wasn't her debut book that they now decided to release.<br /><br />Although the basic premise might have been interesting (a dead body found in Poe's house), you find out very quickly that this has nothing to do with Poe.  I believe this book would certainly have been far better had she decided to include him.<br /><br />While this book is not horrible, its just more of the same that Fairstein has been turning out.  Absolutely nothing new here and the story just is not that interesting.  Its as though she does not know what to write anymore so she keeps using bits and pieces of her other stories.<br /><br />Or maybe I am just tired of reading the works of major authors and having the feeling they just \\"called it in\\".<br /><br />Lately, I have been enjoying unknowns alot more than our \\"bestseller\\" authors.	2005-01-19

While the first few pages are a little weird (i.e. the therapist basically tells the couple what date to get married - and they do) this memoir is fresh and honest.<br /><br />Shapiro takes a frank look at her addictions - starting with cigarettes only to discover that she has many more than she thought (see title).<br /><br />Shapiro writes in a refreshing way and does not mince words when necessary. She manages to keep the tone of the story serious but fun and interesting at the same time.  She is not overly dramatic (which often happens in memoirs) and basically, gives up a few pointers on how to overcome our additions.<br /><br />I thoroughloy enjoyed this book.	2005-01-16

However, butchered bodies are showing up around the area and its bringing out the big guns - such as the FBI.<br /><br />One FBI guy knows instantly who is responsible.  The Prince of Darkness, who was supposed to have been killed two years ago.<br /><br />While the premise of this book sounds exciting, the writing is not.  The author writes in a down to earth manner, but for some reason, spends page after page describing and/or introducting yet another character.<br /><br />This book is deep in characters and very little on plot and action.  Although I get the impression the author was trying to flesh out the characters, the end results is that we get bogged down in the number of characters and we get bored by the little activity there is.<br /><br />While this is not a horrible read, there just isn't much action in this book.	2005-01-12

I also enjoy the main character who is written with intelligence.<br /><br />However, this thriller is EXTREMELY descriptive when it comes to the violence and kind of turned me off a little bit.

Parrish is another great thriller.<br /><br />What I enjoy about this author's work is that he writes intelligent, complex thrillers.<br /><br />The main character is a loner (by choice) although you feel, in this book, that he is starting to get weary of it. Enters the sexy Susan, a defense attorney who has turned Kincaid's eye.  Unfortunatley, she also comes with lots of baggage.<br /><br />Which is where the story really starts unfolding. We have kidnapping, murder and general mayhem.<br /><br />The author has a way of making the action kind of gather momentum and yet, his storytelling is never boring.<br /><br />This book is a must read for any lover of good thrillers.	2005-01-12

This one is made up entirely of email exchanges.<br /><br />I found it a little confusing in the beginning to figure out which character was emailing and to whom. After a while you get use to it though.<br /><br />While there was some clever exchanges, this book is a bit standard stuff for chick lit. The only exception being the bad news delivered to one of the main characters.  I hate serious bad news in chick lit. I read this stuff to relax me and reading about bad stuff just stresses me out.  So, this is one of the reasons I give it a 3 star rating.<br /><br />Also, there are so many characters in this story that you never really get into any of it cauz you are constantly switching voices.<br /><br />This is ok stuff, but don't spend your money on it. Get it at the library.	2005-01-11

Its amazing how much of this stuff is out there and how much of it is just average.<br /><br />I had not really liked this author's previous book, but I thought this one sounded promising.<br /><br />The whole wedding thing is so overdone in chick lit. Especially the whole \\"all my friends are getting married and I am happy to help them with that, but I AM NOT interested in finding a man myself\\".<br /><br />This book never actually gets started.  The author has a lot to say, but never gets anywhere.<br /><br />Also, what is with the tiny, tiny writing? I was pulling out my eyes to read this stuff.<br /><br />Average at best (and I am being kind).	2005-01-11

I was eagerly looking forward to this one.<br /><br />Going Coastal is about our main character -working in a diner and hating it - or so she thinks.<br /><br />Basically, this book is about finding yourself and what you truly love.  There are many wacky characters as you would imagine in the diner and our main heroine has some hilarious interactions with most of them. The writing style is fun and breezy and although there is a \\"morale\\" to this story, the overeall tone is about being who you should be.<br /><br />While this book wasn't as \\"sweet and innocent\\" as Smothering, I still enjoyed it thoroughly.  Great chick lit reading.	2005-01-10

Jackson Novels)	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Excellent	Brady and J.W. are back together again on Martha's Vineyard.  This time, each are working on separate projects - which of course end up entertwining.<br /><br />I was hesitant to purchase this book as the last collaboration between these two (I am a HUGE Brady Coyne fan, but not so much J.W.) was far from stellar (in my opinion).<br /><br />No such problems this time around.<br /><br />The story based primarily on a huge charity show staged on Martha's Vineyard which is a perfect breeding ground for sabotage and murder is perfectly written.<br /><br />There is a perfect blend of J.W. and Brady in this one and THANK GOD all of the fishing references are down to a minimum.  Unfortunately, the last collaboration featured pages and pages of fishing stories and it really dragged the story down.  This is not the case here.<br /><br />There is a genuine connection between the two main characters and both authors managed to retain their individual styles, while incorporating each other's writing.<br /><br />The suspense is wonderful and you truly do not really know who did it - until the end.<br /><br />We  could probably do with a lot less adulation when it comes to J.W.'s wife.  The authors insist on describing her beauty, intelligence and overall wonderfulness WAY TOO MUCH.  It really interferes with the story, but this is a small detail.<br /><br />BUY THIS ONE.  ITS WORTH THE PRICE.	2005-01-08

Our main character is married to Mike, but flashes back to whether she should have married Mike - the other one.  Conveniently, the Mike she did not marry appears magically just when she is having doubts about her choice of Mikes.<br /><br />I thought the basic premise of the book was quite clever.  Although I am not a fan of the jumping from past to present, it was done well and was obviously needed in order to give us the proper information.<br /><br />As with a lot of chick lit stuff, I got irritated with the main character here.  She seems to live ONLY for her children and is entirely focused on pleasing everyone around her - except herself - a fact that is distressingly appearing more and more in chick lit.<br /><br />I also enjoy this author's books and I give this one 3 stars - unfortunately, it was not as witty or fun to read as her \\"slightly...\\" series.<br /><br />Still, not a bad read and I would recommend it.	2004-12-31

The story of a woman who spins music for a living and lives on other people`s couches.<br /><br />THIS BOOK IS WEIRD.  The whole premise of a woman sleeping on a different couch every night was strange.  I also wasn't crazy about the subject matter (spinning music).<br /><br />Although the story was well written, I have to admit that after finishing this book, I realized that I did not like any of the characters.<br /><br />The author was good about joining Samantha, PJ and Leslie together - when at first glance it appears they have nothing in common.  However, none of these characters were remotely likeable.<br /><br />PJ who is kind of the main character is not particularly fun and she really gets on your nerves after a while - she relies on absolutely EVERYONE else to do everything for her. Not a pleasant characteristic in a main heroine.<br /><br />I did not hate this book, I just found it very weird and not that much fun to read.	2004-12-30

One of them is Hayley who comes on strong at first.  Then slowly, Hayley starts turning on Anna and starts making her life a living nightmare.  Through all of this, Melanie, another friend hovers between the two never knowing how to deal with the situation.<br /><br />I absolutely loved reading this young-adult book. While I felt, at times, frustrated, mad, sad and scared, this story, told from the point of view of Melanie was so solid and well told.<br /><br />While we can feel Anna's increasing depression at the way Hayley is treating her, I found it interesting to view the character of Hayley - clearly some kind of psycho in the making. It is scary to think that these things (bullying) actually happen to our kids.<br /><br />While I thought the author did a good job of fleshing out Anna's parents, they really only appear towards the end of the book, clueless as to why Anna would try to commit suicide.  This also scares me - that parents seem not to know what is happening with their kids anymore.<br /><br />Melanie is probably the least fleshed out for me. She comes across as weak and extremely vulnerable - which apparently she is.<br /><br />This book is a gem.  I wish they had these types of books when I was growing up!<br /><br />Buy it.	2004-12-24

I mean, I really hated this character. I could not find one good thing about her. I am pretty sure that is not what the author had in mind.<br /><br />She words \\"sue\\" appears at least 50 times in the first 50 pages and Wanda sounds like all she wants to do is get even with everyone (now that she can't beat the crap out of them).<br /><br />I hated, hated this book.

Its obvious that the author is a smart, creative woman, yet, she came across as whiny and self-indulgent.<br /><br />The fact that she stopped breastfeeding, which in turn made her loose her complete identity was painful and frustrating to read. I wanted to scream at her that there is more to life than just being someone's mother.<br /><br />I realize that this was but a symptom of what is really going on for her, but still.... the whole thing just grew tiresome.<br /><br />As for the anorexia, the author makes it sound as though compared to no longer breastfeeding, the anorexia was just a little bit of a problem with food.<br /><br />The one thing I did feel was her struggle with her mother and the self-loathing it left with her. Obviously there is a huge relationship between her mother and her feelings as  a mother, but this book does not have one ounce of humour - it really could have used a little.<br /><br />Thank goodness the book was so slim.<br /><br />Not a recommended read.	2004-12-22

It turns out they catch the guy and place him in Gibson Hospital for the mentally ill.<br /><br />Fast forward to 18 years later and the little girl is now a psychiatrist with a plan to somehow get to the serial killer and along with some friends get a mental memory image of the event of it on tape.<br /><br />Its very confusing in the beginning because although the author tries to explain mental memory images to us laypersons, its stilll not really clear.<br /><br />Anyway, suffice it to say that the scheme backfires and the main character becomes involved in a complicated case of scientific reasearch gone seriously awry.<br /><br />The story was good (what I could get of it) and there are a few intesting turns in the story which kept me reading.  The pace is very good and the author does not get too bogged down in boring details.<br /><br />The only real problems I had (apart from the scientific part) was that I really did not like the main character at all. Although she was supposed to be a heroine, I kind of felt as though she was kind of portrayed as \\"me, me, me\\" and \\"i want, i want, i want\\" all the time. It got a little annoying.<br /><br />Not quite sure what the role of the guy next door was supposed to be either. He kind of floats in and out of the story without giving us a chance to get to know him.<br /><br />Still, this book kept me reading until the end and while I would not reread it over and over again, it was a good read.	2004-12-17

Although the author writes in non-legalese, there is so much said for nothing.  It feels as though the author just keeps writing and writing and never actually gets anywhere with his theme.<br /><br />The action is fair, but I was so bored by the time it appeared that I just could not get into it.<br /><br />I really, really wanted to like this book, but it just did not happen.	2004-12-15

Killing of little children are happening in St-Louis and Chicago with strange coincidences.<br /><br />I LOVE the character of Joe Keough.  This book is not chock full of action, but the author manages to describe the murder scenes with a vivid accuracy (without too much gore) and lets you feel as though you are seeing it yourself.<br /><br />The character of Keough is far from perfect and is, in fact, loaded with confusion. HIs heart is in the right place though and all he knows is that he needs to find the killer(s).<br /><br />As I said, there isn't a ton of action on every page, but Keough will walk you through these murders with a sharp eye and very interesting twists.<br /><br />This is a smart thriller and is absolutely worth the price of the book.<br /><br />Buy it.	2004-12-13

Melissa Senate is a good writer and entertains.<br /><br />This book is fairly standard chick lit fare in that it revolves around weddings and friends.  Throw in the usual \\"eccentric, ego-centered boss\\" and you pretty much have your usual cast of characters.<br /><br />While I thought the premise of this book was a little farfetched - the main character happens to work for a wedding magazine and ends up being their \\"modern bride demo\\", there were a few cute moments.<br /><br />What I truly did enjoy in the book was the unexpected look at the relationship between our main character and her brother and grandmother.  Both of which were highly touching.<br /><br />I could have done without the brother's annoyingly pregnant girlfriend (I have to pee again...).<br /><br />Another bright spot was the main characters circle of friends (including 2 year old Summer).<br /><br />I would love to see Senate's next book focus on this circle of friends - there is potential there.<br /><br />This is fairly standard chick lit stuff - pleasant and breezy.

While I could have used more interaction between Trey and Jane, prior to them heading to the basement, the characters worked for me.<br /><br />This book is fair until you hit about 2/3 of it when the hospital needs to be evacuated and most of the characters find themselves in the dreary, spooky basement.  The author describes the action in a quick, precise manner and makes sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />You can actually picture yourself going through the torture chambers, etc.  As a matter of fact, in my opinion, the descriptions of the basement are more interesting than the \\"bad guys\\" in this book.<br /><br />Put it all together and you get a solid, scary story.	2004-12-01

It was painful enough to read the exerpts where Kerry can't seem to open her mouth and speak a coherent sentence (this happened a few too many times). The author was intent on making sure that Kerry got more and more clueless about her surroundings as the story went on.<br /><br />Also, the whole Dave thing was kind of annoying and went nowhere.<br /><br />The writing style is great and the basic story was great, but I find myself let down a bit.  This was good, but could have been much better.	2004-10-13

Although his second to last book left me a little disappointed, Left for Dead has more than made up for it.<br />A woman wakes up in the hospital with only fragmented  memories of how she got there. Suddenly she is surrounded by friends and family, but something is very wrong.  Why can't she feel connected  to any of them?  and where is her son?<br />In the meantime, a demented serial killer is on the prowl -<br />This thriller reminds me of the old fashioned &quot;who dunnit&quot;.  While I have read thousands of these, I could not, honestly, figure out who the guilty party was until the very end.<br />The writing is wonderfully suggestive, while never giving anything away.  The main character is likeable and the pace is fast and never ending.<br />This is a very good thriller.  Buy it.	2004-07-17

First do No Harm is the story of two scientists who learn the hard way that in their profession, First Do No Harm is the most important thing.<br />A wonderful thriller pitting two scientists, both with good intentions but with very different views of what is the right thing to do.<br />The suspense is upheld throughout the entire book starting in the Congo in the late 1990's to today where the novels brings takes us from the US to Moscow to Nepal.<br />In the process, I learned alot about the potential dangers the smallpox virus can create and the pro and cons of its potential for good.<br />Its difficult to explain this story without giving too much away. Suffice it to say that I could not put down this thriller and as a bonus, it made me sit back and consider the &quot;benefits&quot; of modern medical research.<br />BUY THIS ONE and ENJOY IT!!!	2004-07-02

I read this author because her thrillers usually take place at airports or in a plane (I love airplane disaster/thriller books).  THIS IS WHAT MAKES HER BOOKS DIFFERENT!!!<br />However, this time around, although mention of planes and flying is made in passing, the crux of the action takes place on the ground - turning this thriller into yet another standard, average book.<br />The writing was excellent and the lead character is fun.  But, I was extremely disappointed by the fact that only about 15% of the book takes place in the sky.	2004-04-13

The cover did not attract me, but the storyline sounded different.<br />What a treat.  The writing is breezy and honest, but the most interesting aspect is the author's view of the boys in his class. Or rather the sometimes surprisingly good writings included in the book, which were all done by the kids.<br />I find it great interesting that the author actually made me like these kids.

My opinion of most chick lit books lately has been that there is too much &quot;crap&quot; published out there.  Its not always good.<br />This one is funny, witty and good.  Our main character hooks up with her ex, while still with her current boyfriend.  This, of course, leads her to all kinds of escapades, including a weird and totally impossible trip to Rome.<br />I laughed out loud at times (which I rarely do when reading) and  thought the writing wonderful.<br />HOWEVER, the lead character was portrayed as so innocent and naive at times that It made me want to throw the book up against the wall.  Come on, can we really be expected to believe that she never has a clue?	2004-02-27

So many times, in chick lit books now, the characters are shallow and boring.  This was not the case.<br />A case in point would be the relationship between the lead character and her &quot;stepmother&quot;.<br />While  the ending was quite predictable, I would recommend this to everyone who is looking for a good read.	2004-02-27

However, I thought the author was a bit too flowery in most of the writing.  Although I realize this is a &quot;memoir&quot;, I would have appreciated a more straight forward tone.  At times, I felt as though I was reading part memoir/part poetry and it took away from the core of the story.<br />Also, I realize that OA has anonymity traditions (which I respect), but where are Frances' views, comments, struggles with the 12 steps?????  I believe that the look at her spiritual aspect re:  OA  was sorely lacking.  A few casual comments were dropped, but when you read this book you get more of a feeling that OA is about the weight than the Steps.<br />I did, however, greatly appreciated the author's very candid look at herself and her life.	2004-02-08

I was hesitant to purchase this \\"chick lit\\" book as I have become bored and somewhat sickened by the stuff published under \\"chick lit\\" these days.<br />However, I am grateful that I went ahead and bought it.  The two leads (female) are extremely interesting and well-defined characters.<br />Oddly enough, the men, in this book play a distant third to the women and their relationship building - with themselves.<br />The author has chosen to work on her leads and have them discover more and more about themselves with each event in their lives.  Be it, career changes, Overeaters Anonymous meetings, these women are growing emotionally and spiriutally.<br />There are lots of fun moments though and this book is far from being heavy or preachy.<br />Buy it.	2004-01-06

Kate and her daugher get on the plane and their lives change forever.<br />This book was excellent.  I was worried, at first, that the crux of the story would occur on the ground (I LOVE airplane disaster stories), but I need not worry.  The last 40 or so pages are based in the air and are completely hair raising.<br />I enjoy this author's writing style, the characters are enjoyable and the pace is great.<br />One comment though.  I felt as though the author portrays his  Kate character with just a little too much sugar.  The relationship between the grandmother and grandaughter is fine, but anytime the relationships involved Kate the whole thing gets kind of sugary.  The relationship between Kate and her mother is a little too perfect and frankly, silly.  The relationship between Kate and Molly was sometimes annoying as  Kate's ONLY focus was always &quot;I want to be with my baby, I want to be with my baby&quot;...  Too much.  I realize that the basis of the story is to save Molly, but the author made Kate sound so silly at times.	2003-12-06

I see by the other reviews (most of them anyway) that it was highly enjoyed. My comments are mixed.  This book was extremely well written.  The suspense was present from the beginning and kept me riveted...until 2/3 into the story.  When &quot;Dr. Dean&quot; starts figuring out what is happening, I lost interest.  The problem: the ending belonged in a science-fiction book.  I would have been happy with either a supernatural ending or a &quot;thriller&quot; ending, but this story ended up in Robert Heinlein land.  I HATE SCIENCE-FICTION, that is why I buy thrillers.  I think it was a mistake for the author to do this.<br />So, for me, this one only rates 3 stars.	2003-08-09

Fine - but I have to say that FINALLY there is some smart, interesting chick lit out there.<br />I am a big fan of the genre, Bridget Jones being a personal favorite. However, in the last little while, I feel as though too much &quot;junk&quot; has been printed  in the name of &quot;chick lit&quot;.<br />Finally, Coffee and Kung Fu is a wonderfully written, SMART book. This book will actually make you think about feelings, expectations and loss.<br />The main character, Nicci, is not adorable, cutesy or perfect. She is actually quite ordinary - which is, of course, part of the charm of this story. What a nice switch of pace - a main character who is actually very ordinary. She doesn't come out with terrifically witty comebacks, doesn't seem to have any money at all, and most surprisingly, very little interest in men, marriage and 2.5 kids.<br />Although the story tended to lull a little bit (too much Rob) and the Ethan character could have been a little more fleshed out (although this may be intentional on the part of the writer), I would recommend this book to anyone who is tired of reading generic chick lit stuff.	2003-07-28

The premise of the book (a food addict attends a clinic to help her understand her food addiction) was of great interest to me.<br />The use of food addict was also something that drew me to this book, as I have believed for a long time that there is such a thing.<br />This book does not disappoint. The author is very honest in her detailing of her experiences. From the beginning when she felt that this clinic stay was of no use to her, we can feel the pain she was in. The story simply gets more fascinating (and candid) as the author reveals herself more and more. In the end, you are cheering her on.<br />I have found this book to be extremely helpful in looking at the whole body image, wellness issue in a totally different view. If you are hoping for a quick fix, this would not be the book for you.<br />But if you believe that you can achieve wellness by better understanding your body and mind, this is the book for you.<br />Excellent purchase!	2002-10-07

Although I do enjoy the casualness of  the author's writing style, I was left wanting more. It seemed to me that the author never stuck to a situation long enough for us to get a real feel for what she and the people around her where going through.<br />I believe this book would have worked better if she had stuck to a job longer instead of fluttering from job to job.

The main character, Nina, is a wonderful contrast of hard professional, soft motherly instinct and confused woman.

I am not usually a fan of \\"noir\\" thrillers, but this author has gotten me totally hooked on her stuff.<br />The main character \\"Cass\\" is a wonderfuln mixture of likeable and not so likeable.<br />The story is set in a somewhat dark area \\"prison, good vs bad religion, sex\\" and the author intermingles all of her characters wonderfully.<br />Perhaps the ending was a bit contrived, but that absolutely does not remove from the story that got you there.<br />BUY THIS BOOK	2002-07-14

This book felt tedious and contrived. I missed the wonderful sarcasm that was so evident in Amanda`s Wedding and I just could not like any of the characters in this one.<br />This book simply felt off for me.<br />I did not enjoy the &quot;so called&quot; romance aspect of it and unfortunately, the comedy wasn`t very funny.

This BookNotes is practical, efficient and lightweight. I mention the weight issue because I intended to carry this book with me everywhere and did not, therefore, want it to be a burden.<br />The sections are: Tracking system for books loaned (could have done without this), Book Notes (to me the most valuable part of this book - they could have added a few more pages to this section), Notes to Myself (always helpful)and numbers of note.<br />Nice clear printing (large letters) and wonderful quotations on books can be found throughout.<br />Excellent purchase.	2002-05-19

Well, its really not. Although I like the writer`s flowing style of writing, this book is as far from a romantic comedy as you can get.<br />The author intermingles too many things and we end up having difficulty sorting through it all.<br />I also never felt a deep connection with any of the main characters in this book, especially between the girlfriends.<br />I enjoyed the book, but basically expected it to be a lot more entertaining.

While this book is more of a techno thriller, the plotline moves at top speed (I finished it in two sittings).

I was looking forward to reading The Jury and was very pleased by it. Although I have a bit of a problem with the title (the Jury wasn't a big part of the book) Martini can tell a courtroom story with the best of them.

I also ended up reading them out of order, starting with Slightly Chipped.<br />I loved the premise of these books.  I loved reading about two people discovering their love of books and more specifically their love of collecting.  Their writing style is funny, witty and entertaining.<br />Although I loved all three books, I thought that Warmly Inscribed was the weakest of the three books.  The charm, for me, of the first two books was to read about the Goldstone's anecdotes about their constant search for yet another bookstore and, of course, another book that they could not possibly buy (but ended up buying anyway).  The last book did not have the &quot;friendly, fun, never know what you are going to discover next feeling&quot; that the first two books had. The story was somewhat dry (the forger story was too long) and it felt as though they kept jumping from one story to another without really telling us anything.<br />By the way, I enjoy hearing about the meals they have during their book collecting trips.  THAT's the kind of stuff that made the first two books fun!	2001-07-08

However, all is not what it seems and soon Gordon and Teresa are involved in an illicit affair which forces Gordon and Ellie to hatch some deadly plans.<br />What first grabbed me about this book was the cover (yes, I will admit it). Bright yellow and the word &quot;suspense&quot; prominently shown.<br />I am glad I did. While the beginning can be a tad slow, the book moves along at a nice pace towards the middle to the end. None of the characters are overly likable, yet, you can sort of sympathize with them on some level. The story is enthralling and I love the various settings for this book (Cape Cod, the boardroom, the polical arena).

A nice apartment in a trendy London area, a good job writing for Successful Savings, socialite friends and tons of clothing.<br />The only problem is, she can't afford the clothes, the only reason she has such a nice flat is because she shares it with a rich debutante and she absolutely HATES her job.  So, she shops! and shops!<br />I tried very hard to like the main character in this book. I failed.<br />Although the story is told in a fun way, you never feel an ounce of sympathy for Becky.  She comes across as self-centered, living in her own little world which, frankly, borders on the silly.  I often found myself thinking that this character could never possibly exist in the real world.<br />Similarly, all the people in Becky's life seem to float around her in their own little worlds. She doesn't seem to connect with any of them until the very end, where magically, all falls into place.<br />The only redeeming feature of this book was the breezy, often funny descriptions of Becky's shopping trips.	2001-02-08

Interesting to see the 30 year old males point of view.  Of course, I had a few problems with Digby's constance search for a perfect, slim, 21 year old - but that's MY issue.<br />You laugh through both Nadine's and Digby's misfortunes and silly games and find yourself rooting for them.<br />I have to say that savoring the trip to the ending was much better than the actual ending itself - which was somewhat predictable.<br />All in all a great read!	2001-02-06

He writes intelligent thrillers about the financial world.<br />I read this book in hardcover quite a while ago.  However, as always, his characters were a mixture of likable and not so likable people.  The speed of the storyline (always in the finance world where things go at a hectic pace) is good and the plotlines are interesting.<br />I always prefer authors who give their &quot;main characters&quot; human flaws and Frey does that very well here.

He tries to &quot;remake&quot; himself by becoming a detective in a small town and by finding love again.<br />However, Jack soons becomes the target of another serial killer intent on exposing a nasty secret and Jack's past now catches up with him.<br />This book walks the fine line between good and evil with our hero battling his inner demons and trying to find the serial killer before he kills again.<br />I just could not put this book down.  The pace was constant and the storyline just kept turning and turning.  I especially liked the way the author did not make Jack out to be some kind of &quot;superman&quot;.

Its as though Kellerman wasn't quite sure what  kind of person Cindy should be so she made her into a very  &quot;neutral&quot; kind of person.<br />Also, I found the storyline was very  slow.

It seems as though NTR had not  published anything of this type for a while. Although I thought this book  had its moments - it really takes an interesting look at both the  &quot;police procedurial&quot; and the &quot;victim&quot; side of the laws,  including a very interesting turn of events for Lilly's estranged husband-  the author insists on MUDDLING this by overdoing it with the interaction  between Lilly(the main character) and Shana (her daughter).  While I  realize that this is one of the main plotlines, the author makes Shana  sound like a whiny 5 year old (when indeed she is in college) who cannot  function without daddy or mommy.<br />She made the main character (Lilly)  sound like a dotting mother, absolutely controlled by every whiny emotion  Shana has.<br />Frankly, this whole relationship did not work at all and  seriously removed a lot of the pleasure of this book for me.<br />I wish the  author would just stick to the legal thriller aspect which, in my opinion,  is the only redeeming feature in this book.	2000-08-20

It always seems that Marlene, Butch and Lucy are all living out  their lives separately and that although the stories do cross over, are  never really intertwined properly.<br />This last novel is no exception to  this.  While I admire Tanenbaum's attitude of &quot;strong women - no  victims&quot; approach in all his books, I never get the feeling that the  characters complete themselves.<br />Nonetheless, a good read and of course,  as always, the somewhat &quot;dry humor&quot; is always great.	2000-08-12

In this newest book, Nina is still trying to get over the death of her  husband (frankly a plot development from the last book that I felt was NOT  needed).  In the midst of all this, her son comes to her for help.  A  friend is in legal trouble and needs help.  From here, the O'Shaughnessey's  develop a well thought out, interesting &quot;who done it&quot; that will  leave you guessing throughout.<br />I like the way this book thoroughly  explores the legal aspect without hitting you over the head with it. While  the authors attempted to bring the supporting characters into play once  again (her son, Paul, her brother and sister in law as well as the office  staff), I felt that they did not do as good a job with this as in previous  books.  While the story was centered on her son and his friend, the son  character was underdeveloped in my opinion.  I also thoroughly enjoy Paul  and Nina and while it is explored again in this book, it feels as though we  are left at exactly the same point as in the previous books.<br />Regardless  of this, this was a wonderful read and this series is one my favorites.  I  just wish they would write more than one novel a year or at the very least,  make their books twice as long since it always feel too short :)	2000-08-12

This book answers the eternal question &quot;what  if...&quot; and makes us see that the &quot;grass really is always greener  on the other side&quot;.<br />Written with wry humor and some very poignant  moments (especially for those of us who let &quot;him&quot; get away) this  book makes us think that what we have here, today is o.k.<br />I absolutely  loved the writing style (airy and down to earth) and as previously  mentioned, thought the premise was excellent and very well rounded out.  An  absolute fun to read and I hope this auhtor comes back with more, more,  more.	2000-08-02

Although I am younger than Cybill, I feel she portrays a realistic image of women in the media and in life in general.<br />This book ABSOLUTELY confirmed this.  Cybill's  writing is to the point and honest.  If you are going to do an  autobiography - it should be intertaining and honest.<br />Cybill pulls no  punches and describes her life with humour (most of the time), some wisdom  and a lot of honesty.<br />I was a little surprised at some of the  relationships she has had, but she will be the first to tell you &quot;no  regrets&quot;.<br />This book is interesting, real and I have absolutely no  regrets about buying it.  Thank you Cybill for telling it like it really  is.	2000-04-04

Unlike Frey's last one, this one has a very good pace to it and the story is enthralling from beginning to end.<br />Some of his characters are very down and dirty and I certainly would  not want to be working with most of these but they are certainly needed to  hold the story together and they do this wonderfully.<br />The only negative  is that Frey tends to downplay the women in his books  - Oliver's wife and  mistress are good examples of this.  Let's get some stronger women roles  throughout his books.<br />Overall, this is the best one yet! I can't wait to  read the next one.	1999-10-04
