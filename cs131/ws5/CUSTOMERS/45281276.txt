US	45281276	R26AGZS281D1NU	0399147284	853678814	Chosen Prey	Books	4	28	33	N	N	4 stars as part of a series 2 stars as a stand alone book	This was a hard book for me to rate. I have read the previous books in Sandford's Prey series, eleven in all. As a reader who is familiar with all long running characters and plot threads, reading this book was like running into an old friend you have not seen in years, and talking like you live next door to each other. It was a pleasure to read simply for the continued evolution of the characters I have grown to know and love.<br />On the other hand, as a passable, stand alone novel, Sandford falls so far short of his past triumphs that I wonder if this does not signal the end for Lucas Davenport and company. Gone is all the tension, suspense, and thrill-of-the-chase that was so prevalent in many of the early Prey books. It has been replaced with a tired reworking of past Prey villains and a soap opera pace. In fact, the hunt for the bad guy plays a secondary role to Lucas' relationship with his ex-fianc&eacute;e. It is writing like this that leads me to believe that Sandford is trying to stage a stopping point in this series.<br />If you have not read the previous Prey books, perhaps your money or time would be better spent reading a different book. If you are a Prey veteran, then carry on.	2001-08-31

It may read or sound like a review, but it is not, because what could I possibly say about 'Truman', by David McCullough, that cannot be summed up in one word: Pulitzer.<br />Nothing. Obviously.<br />What I can do is tell you that as someone who grew up in Jackson County, Missouri, (not far from Independence) this book was a revelation. I learned things about the history of Jackson County that I never could have found in any other book. I have driven on roads, played at parks, and been inside buildings that were named for the people who shaped my region's history; People who were heretofore unknown to me entirely. For this information alone, I recommend this book to anyone who has lived in Jackson County or Independence, Missouri.<br />If you have no such affiliation with that particular area, the biography of a simple man who became the most powerful man in the world, and who shaped so much of our nation's history, isn't bad either. Some other reviews here on Amazon.com have stated that this book reads like a Harry Truman love-fest. I do not think that is quite the fair assessment. While McCullough's rendition of history does seem to cast a somewhat glowing light on Truman, who is to say that it is not deserved. I could list the many monumental and significant things that HST accomplished while in public office, but it would a waste of my time. All I can do is recommend that you read this book and have confidence that you will be able to objectively weigh his momentous deeds along with his failures and flaws, and, in the end, give Harry S Truman his rightful place in history.	2001-08-31

If you have not read those volumes, do so now.<br />In this episode, the charter members of The Mossepath League encounter their alter egos in the form of the Dash-it-All Boys, while the other members of the league match themselves against a secret society, obsessed with discovering lost Viking riches, known as the Broumnage Club.<br />These adventures, however, are once again woven into the fabric of the continuing story of Bird, a small boy whose story has been heretofore a mystery, in great Van Reid style. That is to say brilliantly. Reid's talent for intertwining story threads is unmatched by any author in my eclectic library, and it is a singular pleasure to find recurring, peripheral characters scattered about the pages of  'Daniel Plainway', as well as 'Mollie Peer'. When these characters appear, it is sometimes to deliver a funny anecdote or story, or to be merely a small participant in an ongoing conversation; and whether identified by name, or left for me to surmise their identity myself, I always feel like a participant in an inside joke.<br />I would love to apprise you as to the identity of Daniel Plainway, or hint at how he is connected to young Bird, but I feel I would be diminishing your reading pleasure, not enhancing it. The best turn I could do for you, in regards to this review, is stress upon you the joy you will have in reading Van Reid's chronicles of The Moosepath League, starting with 'Cordelia Underwood', then 'Mollie Peer' and ending with 'Daniel Plainway'.<br />I feel confident when you are finished with this trio, you will be anticipating the fourth installment in this saga as eagerly as I am.	2001-08-02

'Mollie Peer' is the second installment in the adventures of the Moosepath League. If you have not read the first installment, 'Cordelia Underwood', you should do so now.<br />Once again, Van Reid gives us a charming, funny and altogether delightful romp through historic Maine. This time around the story is a little more tense and fast-paced, but Reid still manages to infuse enough humor and romance to keep the reading light and breezy. Reid also includes a great piece of New England folklore when he recounts the Riddle of the Needle, Rock, and Mirror. This anecdote alone is almost enough to justify reading this book.<br />The members of the Moosepath League are some of the most enjoyable characters I have ever come across in my reading, and I have complete confidence that you will feel the same.	2001-07-29

The story in the second book is a little better than the first, but you will soon decide that it does not matter what she writes about as long as she does it in fine Stephanie Plum style.<br />If you have read 'One for the Money' chances are you are only reading this review by accident because you would have already started reading 'Two for the Dough'.

In 'Three Plums in One' you get the first three books in the Stephanie Plum series, 'One for the Money', 'Two for the Dough' and 'Three to Get Deadly'. Evanovich has created one of the most endearing, hilarious and completely entertaining characters to populate any genre of fiction you could hope to read in your lifetime.<br />Stephanie Plum is an out-of-work lingerie buyer who falls into bounty hunting through a combination of a family acquaintance and a pressing need for food, shelter and neon shades of makeup. When you think of a Bounty Hunter you think of a smart, cunning, confident law-enforcement type, but after you meet her, you will think &quot;Oxymoron&quot; whenever you hear the phrase &quot;Stephanie Plum, Bounty Hunter.&quot;<br />Stephanie bungles her way through several fugitive apprehensions, as well as a rocky, quasi-romantic relationship, all the while giving us all the hilarious details in her frank, rambling narrative. Joe Morelli, a Trenton, New Jersey vice cop, plays Tracy to Stephanie's Hepburn, and Evanovich will have you in tears with her talent for writing the sardonic and sarcastic dialogue that takes place between these two.<br />Each episode has an underlying mystery to solve, but soon after you start reading you will discover that no matter what Stephanie is describing in her narrative, you would happily read along, much in the same way you would listening to a master storyteller describe a root canal.<br />'Three Plums in One' is a fast, sometimes suspenseful and often (very often) hilarious read. The three novels run together seamlessly, creating a sense of continuity that will have you thinking it was written as one novel, and then divided.<br />Read this book now. You will not be sorry. And, just for fun, count the cars.	2001-07-26

I feel like a sell-out giving this book five stars. I started reading this book expecting a tough, street-smart bounty hunter, but got a stumbling, bumbling out-of-work lingerie buyer instead, and I still loved her. I thought I would be reading a taught and suspenseful thriller, but got a running narrative from a stumbling, bumbling out-of-work lingerie buyer instead, and I still loved it.<br />It was only after reading 'One for the Money' did I realize that Evanovich's genius was in the crafting of one of the most entertaining and real characters ever created, and not in the tight plotting of a mystery or thriller. The story is incidental, it is the laugh-out-loud narrative of Stephanie Plum that makes this book great. She has a matter-of-fact sense about her that often makes her comments regarding the bizarre circumstances of her life quite hilarious.<br />When you read this book, and you should, you will laugh aloud, a lot. If you do not, then something is wrong with you.<br />Read this book now.	2001-07-22

Dan Brown's 'Angels &amp; Demons' is a fast paced, eclectic suspense/thriller. His cast of characters include a Harvard symbology professor, a couple of brilliant scientists from C.E.R.N., the head of the Vatican's Swiss Guard, the dead Pope's chamberlain, and the famed anti-Christian cult of the Illuminati. He intertwines space-age technology with ancient catholic rituals without skipping a beat.<br />I decided to read this book after reading other reviews from Amazon.com. One reviewer stated something like &quot;move over Umberto Eco.&quot; Well, not quite. Brown does not write in the same erudite, literary fashion as Eco, but he does create a very enthralling page-turner. Other reviewers said it was too unbelievable. Well, it does require you to suspend disbelief, but it is fiction after all. I will not go into the details of the plot, as other reviews have already covered it, but I will say that 'Angels &amp; Demons' reminds me of Michael Crichton's 'Timeline' in that the plot is pushed forward, at a dizzying pace, by a deadline.<br />This book will grab you, and it might not let go. When you reach the heart of the book, the short, crisp chapters - there are over 100 - will keep you reading, because each one ends with a little teaser. I kept telling myself &quot;One more small chapter.&quot; The problem was, I said it after every chapter, until I was finally done at six in the morning.<br />Read this book. Now.	2001-07-17

This must be an example of great modesty, because this book is nothing short of a work of genius. After reading 'Cordelia Underwood' I would have thought that Mr. Reid would surely have various degrees and titles to his name, the least of which would have been Professor of Literature at some fine college, and the most of which would have been Historian and Archivist for The Moosepath League.<br />Van Reid has written a good old-fashioned yarn that includes humor (the laugh-out-loud variety, and lots of it,) wit, romance, and an undeniable sense of adventure that sweeps the reader away to another time and place. The cast of wonderful characters and the eloquent and the stylishly written narrative transform themselves into a vivid, transportive tale, the likes of which I have never read before.  Although I have read many books, and wished myself a part of them, I have never had the yearning to have known the characters and participated in the adventures written about, as I had with 'Cordelia Underwood.' I was truly saddened that the book had to end.<br />To try to describe the plot, or explain its finer points, would only take away from the experience of reading this book, so, suffice it to say that a chance meeting at a local wharf between Cordelia Underwood and Tobias Walton starts these two on numerous solo and intersecting adventures. In addition, any attempt on my part to describe these two main characters would only detract from the pleasure you will have in meeting them for the first time yourselves.<br />I love this book and I completely recommend it to everyone. Read it NOW.	2001-07-16

What if the Cuban Missile Crisis had not ended, but became a nuclear war instead? DuBois paints a very harrowing picture of a military state in his post-war America.<br />The story takes place in 1972, ten years after the Cuban War, and it centers on Carl Landry, an ex-army sergeant who is now a reporter for the Boston Globe. He has a strange encounter with another veteran who turns up dead a month later. Although his editor tells him to drop the story, Carl thinks something is amiss and continues to investigate. Intrigue ensues. The story gets a little convoluted at times, and is easy to predict at others; but overall it is fast paced and engrossing.<br />If you enjoyed 'Fatherland' then you will probably enjoy 'Resurrection Day.' And if you have not read 'Fatherland' and you read and enjoy this book, give it a try.	2001-07-05

It is a masterpiece of noir fiction.<br />The plot is an historical &quot;What if.&quot; What if Germany won the war? What if Joseph Kennedy became President, not JFK? What if the world never found out about the Jewish exterminations that took place at German concentration camps?  All scary prospects to be sure; but Harris does a fine job with the story and details, and truly makes the reader feel that, not only is it plausible, but could have very easily happened.<br />The first part of the book is a murder/conspiracy mystery, and then when the mystery is solved, the second half hinges on suspense. While reading 'Fatherland&quot;, I could not help but feel like I was reading an important piece of fiction. That may not have been the case, but I am sure that I was reading one of the finest alternative histories ever written or imagined.<br />If you like historical fiction, or if WW2 fiction interests you, then do not miss this fine novel.	2001-07-01

I would like to prevent any other readers from making the same mistake.<br />Crabbe sure knows a lot of information about the Brooklyn Bridge, but his delivery needed some more editing and polish. I found his attempt to write accents, and what he must suppose was southern use of language, was laughable. It was also frustrating to read several pages of irrelevant story, for no better reasons than to impart more statistics and facts about the bridge itself.<br />Please do not read this book because of the comparisons to Caleb Carr. Read this book because you think the plot sounds interesting, or you like the cover art or anything other than the comparisons to 'The Alienist.'	2001-06-28

However, I am trying to introduce my wife to the world of reading, and this is the book she wanted to read. She asked me to read it as well, so that we could discuss it afterwards.<br />I surely hope that Sparks was using this seventh grade writing style as a tool to convey the speech patterns of the narrator. Because, if this is truly his writing style, he is one sorry author. He uses the phrase &quot;If you know what I mean&quot; just about a million times. His prose literally rambles on like a middle school short story for a creative writing class.<br />However, in spite of the fact that this book is total slop, I liked it. I thought parts of were touching. Even if the plot was movie-of-the-week material. I can't help it. I must be just a big softy, because I got choked up several times.<br />The only downside to liking this book, for me, is that now my wife wants to read another Nicholas Sparks book. Oh well, the things we do for love.	2001-06-27
US	45281276	R99UFRXY5UOMH	060960483X	976422585	The Book of Q: A Novel	Books	4	8	11	N	N	Read this for fun, not Enlightment	This book is a thriller/adventure book. Of course, that is my opinion. It is not a historical mystery or historical thriller. It is not a revelation on the true word of Christ; however, it is a small diatribe on the institution of the Catholic Church. Again, this is only my opinion.<br />My point being, if you like the thriller or adventure genres, then you might find this book to your liking. If you are considering this book because you find the history of the church or scriptures interesting, or you are looking to find a new, different view of the Bible, look elsewhere.<br />The story centers on a young priest, Ian Pearse, who gets caught up in a quest to find an ancient scroll. The Manicheans, a secret society of a Faith long thought destroyed by the Catholic Church, desperately want to find the scroll so that they may, in turn, destroy the Catholic Church with its revelations on the true word of Christ.<br />'The Book of Q' is, at points, far-fetched and contrived. But, hey, this IS fiction. My biggest complaint is the unnecessary detail Rabb uses in his descriptions of the various locales used in the book. Without providing maps to reference, his use of exact street names, as well as exact landmarks, often ends up being frustrating, and distracts from the story. Unless, of course, you have actually been to Vatican City and the other places described in the book.<br />Read this book for the adventure and suspense, not for theological extrapolations.	2001-06-26

There are two main storylines: cracking the enigma code before a shipping convoy is destroyed, and discovering the motives and intentions of the mysterious Claire Romilly.<br />Both these storylines revolve around the main character, Tom Jericho, a cryptanalyst working on breaking the german naval enigma code.<br />'Enigma' starts off very slowly, and after 90 pages, I was about to put the book down and move on. However, Harris really starts getting to the heart of the action about this time, and the book really takes off. Perhaps he could have condensed the first 90 pages and made this book five stars, but taken as a whole 'Enigma' is quite entertaining.<br />If you enjoy books about wartime codebreaking, you will definitely want to read this book. If you read and enjoy 'Enigma', you should check out Neal Stephenson's 'Cryptonomicon.'	2001-06-24

I agree with most of them, that this was a fine book. Out of the five Kenzie/Gennaro books in the series, this is perhaps my favorite. It leans a little more into the thriller/suspense genre than it does the PI genre, but that is OK, because I know it is a series and not a stand-alone book.<br />Some reviewers (a few) have panned this book as derivative and in one particular spot too much like 'Silence of the Lambs'. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but I would just say that almost everything is derivative in some way, and Harris does not have a patent on prison visitations as a plotline.<br />Dennis Lehane crafts some of the best sentences I have read in this genre, so you should read the entire Kenzie/Gennaro series starting with 'A Drink Before the War', and if you have already read it, then read 'Darkness, Take My Hand' NOW.	2001-06-19

However, it has all these things to the 10th power. Mooney also makes some mistakes with plotting and details.<br />Some examples are: in one sequence Jack Casey, the ex-FBI, small town detective main character, is driving a truck, and then he is in a Porsche, and then is once again in the truck. The Sandman, the evil genius always knows Casey's cell phone number, no matter how many new phones Casey gets. In addition, the Sandman always has better technology than the FBI. The Sandman's technological expertise almost becomes comical later in the book. I will not even mention the problems with the Invisible-Man-ex-profiler-techno-wharehouse Malcolm Fletcher.<br />There are also quite a few times when it becomes obvious that this is Mooney's first book. The example that annoyed me the most was Mooney's numerous descriptions of how Casey would become weak or lightheaded. When you read the book, just count 'em.<br />I rated this book three stars because it was fairly exciting to read, even given the flaws I mentioned above. And I definitely think it would make a very good Die-Hard type movie.	2001-06-17

Then, maybe just to show off, Lehane plays a little running commentary, about right and wrong, good and bad, designed to give this novel a literary conscience.<br />If that sounds like a load, well, remember it is 1:15 in the morning.<br />Patrick Kenzie's narration is filled with such wry wit and humor; you cannot help but like him.

Deaver is one of my favorite authors, but this book just does not have the punch that his others had. I had high expectations for Tate Collier, but he turned out to be a paper-thin portrayal with no character.<br />I actually found myself rooting for Dr. Aaron Matthews, the villain, especially after he makes some quite ingenious moves in order to destroy the lives of the main characters.<br />Overall, although the characters are written thinly, and it lacks the typical Deaver-esque suspense, 'Speaking in Tongues' is an O.K. book.

Fire Marshal Georgia Skeehan solves cases and catches bad guy. But could it really be that simple? NO.<br />Suzanne Chazin has written a hugely entertaining, suspenseful and original thriller. And it was her debut novel to boot.<br />Chazin has created a real, sympathetic heroine in Georgia Skeehan. I look forward to reading the next Skeehan book.<br />I could not help but feel while I was reading this book that it was written by Jeffery Deaver. Chazin's prose is very similar to Deaver's, and she even personalizes the bad guy by giving him a nickname until we discover his identity. This is something that Deaver does often, and very effectively. In addition, the level of suspense, and the feeling that there is a suprise waiting around every page also reminds me of Deaver.<br />If you have ever read a Deaver book, or if you like page-turning suspense with an original story and, a new, original heroine, read this book.	2001-06-07
US	45281276	R1Q1CB7DMTRTBG	0151002991	328763020	In the Garden of Iden: A Novel of the Company	Books	4	4	5	N	N	A Different take on Time Travel	I decided to read this book, based on Amazon.com's suggestions, since I really liked 'To Say Nothing of the Dog' by Connie Willis.<br />Although 'Iden&quot; is similar in some ways to 'Dog', I found myself feeling disappointed about 100-150 pages into the book. However, I was committing one of the cardinal sins of reading: I was not reading with an open mind. So, I cleared my head of any preconceived notions or expectations, and found that I really did like this book.<br />The main character is Mendoza, a child who was saved from the Spanish Inquisition by the &quot;Company.&quot; The Company saves children destined to die, and makes them immortal, in order to have them save things that become extinct in the future, such as plants and animals.<br />Mendoza's specialty is plants, and her first assignment is to preserve a plant that can cure liver cancer. She meets a mortal man, and falls in love. Most of the book deals with Mendoza's internal conflict over being immortal versus loving a mortal. I wished that Baker could have woven a better subplot, but because this is a series and not just one novel, the absence of a more intricate storyline is acceptable.<br />Baker also stays away from annoyingly explaining, in detail, every piece of electronic equipment used or referred to in this book. A lot of times SF authors feel the need to treat the readers like they have no imagination, or intelligence, and therefore have to give you specs, not to mention the instruction manual, on any gadgets or machines. Baker does not do this.<br />I look forward to reading the other &quot;Company&quot; books. If you like Time-Travel or the idea of Immortals, read this book. Moreover, if you like it, you should really check out 'To Say Nothing of the Dog' by Connie Willis, as well.	2001-06-06

While I think Nasaw did a very good job researching the medical side of this book, I think he fell asleep at the wheel when it came to the actions of FBI Agent E.L. Pender.<br />I would have enjoyed this book so much more if Pender had been a private detective hired by a family member of one of the missing women. It would have made it much easier to believe all the stupid mistakes he makes. He did not ring true for a FBI agent. He especially did not ring true for a FBI agent who supposedly has 20 years experience hunting down serial killers. I could give you examples of why I feel this way, but it would ruin certain parts of the book, in case you do decide to read it.<br />'The Girls He Adored' moved along at quite a quick pace, but I was left feeling like Nasaw had written a much larger book, and stripped away pieces at random, just to make it shorter. Much of what was stripped away must have been the parts where we learn to care about these characters.<br />Overall, I am not upset I read this book, but I would think twice before reading another book by Nasaw.	2001-06-02

You may also have read that some plot lines disappear, or that some obvious questions remained unanswered by the books ending.<br />All these things are true.<br />However, if you like historical fiction, or action/adventure books, you will probably like this one. I loved the way this book blended strong historical references with fiction, and the way it was woven together with a '90's plotline. I like most of the characters, although they were not written with deep volume. Actually, it is a tribute to the scope and pace of this book that I did not object to the characters that were nothing more than vague outlines.<br />There are some implausibilities, such as, how a group of people, or descendants of this group, so intricately laced together during WW2, could, almost randomly, reunite in the '90s without it becoming obvious to everyone involved.<br />Every book has its flaws. The scope, pace, and subject of this book worked well enough for me to overlook, what, in the end are minor flaws.<br />Stephenson has written a book that is exciting, informative, and suprisingly funny. At times, to me, it was gut-busting-teary-eyed-laugh-out-loud funny (i.e. pages 511-528.)<br />Do not let the size or negative reviews scare you off. Despite the flaws I have mentioned above, this book is worth reading.<br />So Read It.	2001-05-31

This book is not a crime novel; it is not even a novel. It is a failed character study of three friends, who are trying to come to grips with one of them reporting to prison for an inevitable 7 year sentence.<br />Had Benioff delved deeper into each of the three friends, and explored and explained their actions in more detail, I believe the book would have been much more satisfying. As it is, I was left feeling cheated.	2001-05-23

I believe that I may try to read one of her other books, possibly 'Fatlands', but I could not recommend 'Mapping the Edge' to anyone.<br />It is very possible that I have too much testosterone to understand the character of Anna. I found in the book's first 100 pages that Anna acts in a totally selfish, and to me, unfamiliar, way towards her child and loved ones. At this point, I did not care what happened to her, and I could not resurrect any such feelings as the book continued.<br />I am sure that many people will find this book enjoyable, I, however, was not one of them.	2001-05-22

Betsy Tobin has written a very compelling little tale about finding one's place in the world (as well as one's true self,) disguised as a murder mystery. The story and style remind me strongly of Thomas H Cook. Tobin's prose is not as stylish or romantic as Cook's, but she has struck the nerve of human emotion and discovery that many of Cook's books achieve.<br />Although 'Bone House' is a short novel, it is very satisfying in the end. While you are waiting for Tobin's next book, check out Thomas H Cook.	2001-05-22

Then, when you think it is all over, Deaver throws in a heart stopping twist.<br />If you have never read a Deaver book, you will probably be hooked after this one.

It is plotted well enough and the pace is blistering. What this book is not, is literature. Moreover, anyone who reads a Michael Crichton book expecting literature needs to fault themselves and not the writer.<br />In this soon-to-be movie (one can only hope) a rag tag team of archeologists visit the 14th century in hopes of saving one of their own, who is unexpectedly trapped in the Middle Ages. Unfortunately, they only have 37 hours to locate and rescue him.<br />If books about time travel or the Middle Ages interest you, be sure not to miss Timeline.	2001-05-19

Occasionally I will read a Stephen King book or something along those lines. I had read some reviews of I Am Legend on Amazon, and when I saw it at the library, it was a very thin book, so I thought why not.<br />What I found was an Orwellian book about human nature, about the desire to continue on, to assimilate. I would compare this book to Animal Farm on several levels.<br />Furthermore, the writing is superb. I understand that this was only Matheson's third book, but his brilliance with the written word, and his understanding of the human condition, was already evident.<br />Horror fans should not miss reading this book. I am not an expert on horror writing, but I believe this book would have to be considered on of the best ever written in that genre. However, if you are not a horror or vampire fan, you should still try this book.<br />I think it would be nearly impossible for anyone who is a fan of great writing to dismiss this book. Read it.	2001-05-18

I started to feel like Sandford was unable to write a Prey book where Davenport wasn't hooking up with a woman, but I did not dwell on it long as this book has a suprise in the form of a mystery witness.

Ellroy takes one of the most debated events in world history and credibly adds his own set of possibilities to the mix.<br />I am no conspiracy junkie, but I simply do not believe Oswald was the lone shooter, or if he ever pulled a trigger that day. For me, Ellroy weaves a wonderfully complex web of conspiracy that feels like a guilty pleasure to read.<br />The tight prose is typical Ellroy, and the scope of this book is epic. Unless you are a mindless sheep willing to be led to slaughter, you will probably never feel the same way about Warren Commission findings again.<br />Read this book.	2001-05-16

The police detective Voort is horrible.<br />However, the worst part of the book was the writing style. Black is all over the place with his writing. He wastes so much of the reader's time with irrelevant material, trying to be descriptive. The problem is his descriptions have nothing to do with anything involving the plot or characters. And when he does try to give us character descriptions he either describes clothing, or attempts to use mundane prose to let us in on the personality of the characters.<br />I could go on and on about how bad this book is, but I will not.

Michael Brock, one of the hostages, discovers a conspiracy, by his own law firm, that is responsible for the homeless man's actions as well as the death of a family forced to sleep in a car.<br />This book is filled with help the Homeless propaganda (not that I dislike the homeless) and it ruins what could have been a great plot.	2001-05-16
US	45281276	R3RQGKYQER7TGZ	055310893X	54175040	The Cutout	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Gripping suspense...	I read a review from another person here on Amazon.com that pretty much ripped this book for violence aimed at kids. I have two children, but I am also one of the most open-minded people around. Frankly, I thought the reader was probably some pent up Christian. I was wrong. I think the level of violence detailed went somewhere just over the top.<br />The horror and atrocities that the author conveys through these violent acts could have been handled in a much better manner. Not that it disturbed me enough to stop reading, I just think some of it was left in for shock value.<br />Having said that, I want you to know how much I really liked this book. It had me at the edge of my seat on many instances. The main character of Caroline Carmichael was extremely well developed, and the sense of deceptive, clandestine betrayal was perfect.<br />The CIA is responsible for the biggest complaint I have about this book. During the preface, Mathews describes how, as an ex-CIA employee, she had to submit this book for their approval; And they only had her change one word. ONE WORD. I read the whole book thinking which word. How could one word make that much difference?<br />If you like gripping suspense and clandestine intrigue, read this book.	2001-05-10

Lindsay gives some depth to the main character, FBI Agent Taz Fallon, by giving him emotional issues. The problem is, you still do not really care about him. He is merely an instrument providing a means to an end.<br />The plot is original, and littered with attempted plot twists. What I am trying to say is that I enjoyed reading this book, and I am not upset that I spent my time reading this book, but the plot twists and revelations were as easy to anticipate as sunrise and sunset.	2001-05-06

I look forward to reading his next one.<br />While he does not quite sport the powerful prose of an Ian Pears when it comes to his descriptive power, he has done a more than adequate job in relaying the horrors committed by the wayward men of the sea. Where Griffin falls a little short is in his lack of emotional depth, or motivation, given to some of the main characters.<br />If you like historical fiction, and/or if you like adventure stories, read this book.<br />You may want to read the glossary in the back of the book before you start, unless you are a veteran of pirate books or the navy.	2001-04-30

I apparently was too forthcoming in the reasons why I like the Edwin Kreiss character so much.<br />This time I will just say that I share his sentiment for the punishment the kidnappers of his daughter deserve.<br />Hunting Season is wrought with political infighting between the government's different alphabet agencies, the FBI, the CIA, the ATF, not to mention the Justice Department. Figuring out who is being honest, and what the real motives are behind any of the actions of these agencies is a mystery in itself, and adds to the enjoyment of this book.<br />Throw in Kreiss, a former CIA/FBI super-agent who specialized in hunting down other agents, and you have one heck of a good book.<br />If you are viewing this review, then you are probably already interested in this book, so do yourself a favor and read it.	2001-04-29

While this effort does not come close to being in the same league as that book, it is quite a good, stimulating read. It is written in the first person, which can take some time to get used to.<br />Iles tries to add flourishing touches of human emotions into the book's sub-story, but the characters are mostly shells. Thomas H Cook is quite good at this, and I wonder if Black Cross was written after Mortal Fear, because Iles' characters in that book were much better.<br />This is a long book, but reads quickly. It is not really a true serial murder mystery because the killer does not fit into that mold, but it does have some interesting plot twists and suspense.<br />While it is no Red Dragon or Silence, it is fun to read.	2001-04-27

I read so many positive reviews on Amazon, and I like historical fiction generally.<br />The main character, Father Felix, is a sniveling, demented crybaby and sissy. I wish I would have been there just to smack him upside his head. I doubt the real Father Felix acted this way.<br />I expected there to be some mystery involed in the plot as well, but Holman was very transparent in this area.<br />I wonder what this book would have been like had Ian Pears written it. (hint: MUCH BETTER)<br />If you are a Holman fan, read it. If you have a long bus ride, and you have a copy of this book, read it.	2001-04-27

I am not saying they shared plot lines, or characters, or anything else for that matter; I just kept feeling like I was reading a remake of the film, only set in WW2 Germany and present day Lisbon.<br />The book has a sweeping epic type of timeline. The main characters eventually give way to their adult children, who then become the focus of the book, save for the Detective trying to solve the initial murder in the present.<br />A Small Death in Lisbon serves up a couple of great plot twists, along with one not-so-great revelation. It was fun to read, and kept me guessing for the most part.<br />I suggest you read it, and see if you get my Casino reference. I am probably just nuts though.<br />Read it.	2001-04-27

I think Places in the Dark is easily on par with 'Instruments'.<br />The human feelings Cook seems to be able to tap into and give his characters is a true talent. The mystery unfolds slowly and gathers steam. And you may guess the revelation about the mystery character's identity, but you will still appreciate deftness in which it is delivered.<br />This book, like most of Cook's books, is short but packed with atmosphere, mystery and human feeling.<br />Read it.	2001-04-21

It was mostly a thriller, but some reviews hinted at a courtroom drama type thing.<br />It was defiantely a suspense/thriller. While the book was a very entertaining read, that moves along at a very quick pace, it is also very predictable.<br />Margolin throws in plot twists that, you, the reader, will find yourself suggesting before they happen. Still, this was a very exciting read. I unfortunately have this knack for plotting and development that ruins most mystery books and movies.<br />And for the ending, it was well drawn out and somewhat believable. I have read that Margolin should be compared to Grisham, but I don't think that is true. Grisham would have built up some suspense, and then ended the book on the last 2 pages. The endings have always been the worst thing about a Grisham novel. He always ends his books so abruptly, like running as fast as you can to the edge of the cliff, and then just falling.<br />Gone, But Not Forgotten is a fun book to read. If you like thrillers, or suspense books, then you should definatley read this.	2001-03-30
US	45281276	RTG39NSIVT17V	055310554X	183251768	Instruments of the Night	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Another Cook masterpiece	Instruments of Night is not written in a stylish prose like Breakheart Hill, but this makes it none the less desriptive. Some reviewers have described the level of sadism or violence to be too high. I am sorry for them.<br />Cook uses small vague descriptions of violence, and makes the reader use their imagination to create the scene. He sets the stage, and your mind directs the play without effort. It was only after some retrospect that I came to realize that I was the one who conjured up the deatiled horrors that Cook hints at. That is exactly how books should be written. They should ease the reader into the book, as if they were an invisible participant, not imagining how the scenes looked, but &quot;knowing&quot; how it happened.<br />I liked this book very much after I finished it, but after several minutes of replaying it inside my mind, I find that I like it even more, mostly for the reasons I mentioned above.<br />This book is not perfect. There are a couple of mistakes that are very secondary to the machinations of the plot, and can be forgiven very easily. I will not tell you what they are, because most likely you will never notice them. The one other thing that seems out of place, is that when the main character, Graves, receives assistance from another writer in solving the mystery, it is hard to tell who, of the two, is the mystery writer.<br />Read this book. It is short, only 296 pages, and can be read in a few hours time. If you don't like it, well then you only wasted a few hours. I actually read this book when I became bogged down in another book I was reading. It was a suprisingly good 'time-out.'	2001-03-29

The action starts fairly quichly, and settles into a good pace. This was the first book by Dennis Lehane I have read, and I wish I would have read the other Kenzie - Gennaro books first. I wish I would have had more insight into the characters, but it did not hurt the book too much.<br />Sacred's splash of mystery, quick pace and decent plot twists make this book a good read. It will not induce any bouts of deep thought, but every now and again it is good to have a change of pace.<br />Read it.	2001-03-24

His style of prose truly lends itself to a daydreaming stream of consciousness. He lets you drift backwards in the main character's memory, and pulls you back to the present, all the time staying mostly in chronological order. Only once or twice does he ask you to piece together a bridge for the occurences being described.<br />This is a very short read, not only in actual legnth, but also because the way the story flows.<br />This book is also excellent when it comes to describing teenage angst and yearning. He uses words in a very beautiful and tearing collage to portray love.<br />There is a very strong element of mystery in this book, and it pulled me in, but the edge of human emotions made me keep reading until I was done, only hours after starting this book.<br />Read it.	2001-03-19

I usually do not read fantasy books, but it is a genre that I am starting to enjoy.<br />This book could take place anywhere, and involve any group of characters, but just so happens to be set in OZ. In my view it is a very clever exercise in theologic theory. It chronicles the life of the &quot;Wicked Witch&quot; of the West, and the events that lead to her becoming the Witch.<br />Some reviewers have given this book bad reviews, stating that the author did not do his research because things did not jive with what they remembered, i.e. The Movie. Well, the movie is not loyal to the actual book. This book does stay very close to the book. I would tell those reviewers to do THEIR research. It kills me that some people probably don't even know there is a book.<br />I would really have given this book 5 stars, except that the ending is convaluted. The main character does things in the last section of the book that are SO against her character that was established in all the preceding pages. It is if Maguire needed to keep the book as close to 400 pages as possible, and he just wrote a quick ending. It was frustrating for me to read the irrational actions of a character I had come to like.<br />Other than the ending it was a enjoyable read. If you like anything OZ, or you like a good fantasy read, you should give this book a try.	2001-03-14

It was the first book by Wilbur Smith that I have read. I will probably read more books by Smith, most probably River God. However, I do not like his writing style at all.<br />If you like hard-boiled writing, or writing that only deals with relevant information that pushes the characters or plot forward, then this book is not for you. In one passage he takes nearly three paragraphs to describe how the upcoming section of the river had a couple of bends in it. This descriptive assault of metaphors does not push the plot ahead, and if it is meant to give depth to the character of the river, it insults the reader with its redundant obviousness. He does this so often, that a book that should have been around 300 pages ends up being nearly 500 pages.<br />These wasted and excessive words actually forced this book to sit unattended for nearly 24 hours on my coffee table. I very seldom delay finishing a book, and at this point I felt like I had to force myself to read on, and, I am sure, that most readers would agree that feeling forced to read is not what recreational reading should be about.<br />Having giving you my complaints, I will now say that, overall, I liked this book. At times it was a real page-turner. I am glad I finished this book.	2001-03-09

Can't Stop	I read this book after reading reviews of it on amazon.com, and having seen it referred to in reviews of other books I had liked.<br />At first, I could not stand the writing style. It just dumps the story and characters into your lap. That is not to say it involves you in the story right off. It takes awhile for you to see any semblance of plot. In the first few chapters there are no less than two people whom you hope are killed in gruesome manners, and the sooner the better. But I kept reading.<br />I still did not particularly like the book, but I had read enough to understand the plot (or so I thought) and I needed to have some answers before I could stop reading and start a new book. I was well into the last third of the book before I realized that I cared about the characters and their fates as much as I needed answers to the questions of the plot.<br />Some people have said this book is a comedy. It is light-hearted, and has some good situational comedy that, if you were watching it as a TV show, would probably make you laugh very hard; However, even though I could see the humor, for me it only pushed the plot ahead faster.<br />I doubt any of you have read my other reviews, but I do not go into characters, or the plot, and I will not here. But, I will tell you that if you dislike this book to begin with, just keep reading and you will be suprised.<br />In addition, for those people who say the book is inaccurate at times, I did notice some inaccuracies, but it is fiction. Get over it.	2001-03-05

Having just read 'An Instance of the Fingerpost', I was somewhat skeptical that I would find another historical mystery with as much depth. As 'Instance' delicately lays down the possible truths to its story, 'A Conspiracy of Paper' hammers you over the head with its plethora of possibilities.<br />There are so many possible conclusions to hypothesize while reading this book, it might be frustrating to someone who cannot devote a good portion of concentration to this book. However, if you enjoy unraveling complex mysteries, you will love this book.<br />I am not one to touch on characters or basic plot lines in my reviews, so I will not go there except to say that most characters are multi-layered, and that this layering adds much to the mystery.<br />The writing style of Liss is not the same circuitous style that Pears uses in 'Instance', but you get used to it after a couple of chapters.<br />If you have read 'An Instance of the Fingerpost' and liked it, read this book. If you have not, then if you like this book after you are done, you should read it as well.	2001-03-02

It stripped away all the preconceived notions of the slave mongering, and morally decrepit Confederate Army. Many characters in this book could simply not fight against their family, even thought they swore an oath at Westpoint to defend the Union. Others merely wanted to defend their states' honor. Others believed that it was their constitutional right to govern themselves that they were fighting for.<br />It is very possible that the underlying cause for the War was slavery, but not because men hungered to own other men as property.<br />I have read some reviews by people for whom this book was required reading, and they have not been fair reviews. I truly feel sorry for anyone who does not have the capacity to understand this fine work of literature. And it is certainly Literature. This book is written so that you may glimpse into the mind of men with great burdens upon them, and makes you one of them. At the end of this book I had a lump in my throat because I feel now I can better understand the enormity of the burden these men faced.<br />Read this book. You owe it to yourself.

I thought it was one of the best historical fiction books I have ever read. Some characters in this book, such as Hanna Siegel, need more development to justify taking up so many pages, but other than that, I thought it was very well written.<br />I have a 50-100-page rule when I read a book. If I am not slightly interested in a character when I reach these pages, I just stop reading and move to the next book. On Secret Service pushed the limits because it spends much of the beginning skipping from character to character, and you are not sure when each will pop up again. However, in the end, this book kept my attention very well. My total reading time was 7 hours, which I completed almost continuously.	2001-02-11
