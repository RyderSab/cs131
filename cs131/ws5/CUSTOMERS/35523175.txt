It is rare that a book draws me in so fully and completely as \\"The Red Tent\\" did. The book sat, unread, on my shelf for a long time - it looked so thick and I knew once I opened it I would give my heart over to it... and indeed I did...and then I immediately passed it along to my daughter to read.<br /><br />While I am fairly Bible literate, this is not a requirement to read this novel - in fact, it would serve as a more compelling introduction to the culture of the times moreso than the old epic movies that used to be so popular and all seemed to star Charlton Heston... *smile*<br /><br />While this is the story of Dinah - the narrator - it goes backward far enough in history and just enough forward to make the circle of the story feel complete. I loved reading about Leah, especially, who in the past I always pitied. Diamont's Leah is not to be pitied - she is to be honored and respected.  The women who married - and shared Jacob - almost made having multiple wives a perfectly ok practice.  I know, odd - but the camaradie and caring they shared was amazing - and the community of \\"the Red Tent\\" made me wish we had something akin to this in present day.... Respite from all the guys and a time to bond as women....  even when rivalries flared and problems arose, there was always someone left who cared....<br /><br />Mid-way through the book there is a tragedy and I almost stopped readiing, it hurt me so deeply.  How often has that happened in my reading life? Never! I might stop because I was bored or indifferent, but not here.<br /><br />\\"The Red Tent\\" is not filled with suspense... its romantic elements are woven artistically into the fabric of the story - there is murder, there is rape, there is abuse, there is sibling rivalry, there is loss and love... but mostly there is heart and connection in a family that stands the test of time and generations - that rights poor choices over generations and keeps the stories of the family alive through oral tradition.<br /><br />I also loved the ongoing theme of the mid-wife repeating itself and appearing across the generations.  Again, there is more life - even for the barren women.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /> <br />I also loved the ongoing theme of the mid-wife repeating itself and appearing across the generations.

Along the journey we meet extended family and see what they have done to cope with the tragedy and twists and turns of life which bring us careening away from life and then, eventually - seem to boomerang us back, eventually, to ourselves.<br /><br />Baggott's writing is exceptionally compelling.  Here are two of my favorite sections:<br /><br />From page 45, told by Pixie:<br /><br />\\"You see, memory is its own animal.  It can hibernate, spawn, and riseup - moths in a well lit room, each thing body lifted by fierce wings.  It doesn't make sense, but sometimes the moths are fireflies - their fiery hearts are what light the room. I'm trying to explain memories as things with wings.  I'm trying to explain my mind, and it's a faulty, desperate thing.  Listen, an ordinary woman, unpacking groceries in a bright kitchen in a cheery colonial, a mother of two, a dentist's wife, could choke to death on so many white moths and fireflies.\\"<br /><br />From page 241, told by Ezra:<br /><br />\\"I wished it was an old train, one with steam, one just about to set off into a fog. I wanted to lose my father in a cloud, but he was standing there, with his heart beating in his chest, blood running through his veins, his lungs pulling and pushing air.  I preferred the ghost.  There was a gust of wind, a hot breeze, and the Phillies baseball cap flipped off my father's head, backward, behind him, into the train and he turned around to go after it.\\"<br /><br />I love the rhythm of the writing and the clear, evocative emotion-pictures Baggott uses... while at the same time feeling just a touch of the narrator's tendency to \\"stand back\\" from the scene.<br /><br />My suggestion is to read this book and feel it for yourself -thm of the writing and the clear, evocative emotion-pictures Baggott uses... while at the same time feeling just a touch of the narrator's tendency to \\"stand back\\" from the scene. <br /> <br />My suggestion is to read this book and feel it for yourself -  <br />	2005-08-22

I wasn't sure what to make of this book when I first opened it. I am an actor and an entrepreneur - so currently \\"act\\" on stage and believe in Shakespeare's oft quoted phrase, \\"All the world's a stage.....\\"<br /><br />I wasn't prepared to find so many valuable tips and tricks to begin to use immediately both in my acting (I am looking forward to my next audition!) and in my everyday life.  I will also try some of this out in my coaching practice - and perhaps modify accordingly.<br /><br />Another bonus is Ms. Robbins writing voice. I have no idea what the voice that springs from her body sounds like, but I just \\"get\\" that it is warm, engaging, open and has a melodious quality to it.... just like her book.  I had to put the book down last night to go meet a friend and I found myself wanting to read \\"just one more suggestion, just one more....\\" And I think it was partially because I wanted to \\"hang out\\" with the author some more.<br /><br />This book would be handy for EVERYONE.

What I love the most about this book is<br /><br />that Ms. Ryan offers such a variety of ideas AND<br /><br />she shares ideas that DON'T work for her that<br /><br />MAY be helpful to you.  She doesn't make those<br /><br />ideas WRONG, she simply says \\"I don't value<br /><br />this but many do\\" such as Walking Meditation... and<br /><br />she gripes about exercise yet asks you to do it<br /><br />and maybe, then, she will feel energized to<br /><br />exercise, too.<br /><br />Some of my favorite suggestions include<br /><br />creating a drawer of happinesss enhancers,<br /><br />Call in Well (this is on my Son's birthday, May<br /><br />6... it isn't a national holiday YET!)....

Debbie Macomber is an excellent weaver of stories.<br /><br />I picked this book up off my coffee table - my mother<br /><br />had left it here after a recent visit.<br /><br />I didn't mean to read it, but I found after starting I<br /><br />had \\"all of a sudden\\" turned all the way to page 45<br /><br />and by then was wholeheartedly curious and committed<br /><br />to the four characters in this carefully \\"knitted together\\"<br /><br />(pun intended) story of deepening love, respect<br /><br />and personal growth.<br /><br />Using the age old craft of Knitting as a metaphor,<br /><br />we meet an unlikely group of friends who each<br /><br />change the others lives.  I found myself equally<br /><br />drawn to all main four characters - who are diverse,<br /><br />I imagine, so readers connect to one.<br /><br />I connected to all four at different times.<br /><br />The reader can almost feel the authors love<br /><br />for both the craft of knitting and for each character -<br /><br />and the continual learning of life lessons along<br /><br />the way. The characters were relatable - meaning,<br /><br />they were like people you and I know.

This play is fascinating on many levels - and is rich<br /><br />enough to continue to wow audiences long after<br /><br />September 11 sinks deeper into history.<br /><br />There is a lot of truth here - richly evident in the<br /><br />human element of the stories Joan and Nick<br /><br />weave together at a time when stories (beyond<br /><br />horror and heartbreak) were able to tell.<br /><br />Joan, a writer, is introduced to Nick in the days<br /><br />after September 11 because Nick has the<br /><br />privilege - and the awesome responsibility -<br /><br />to speak at the funerals of his men who died<br /><br />in the attacks on the World Trade Center.<br /><br />The audience (in this case, reader) gets to know<br /><br />Joan, the interviewer and  more - about her<br /><br />background in Oklahoma.  We learn, for me<br /><br />it was first hand and finally, about the magnitude<br /><br />of the impact this event had on the New York<br /><br />fire departments, especially in Manhatten.<br /><br />The relationship between Nick and Joan is<br /><br />remarkable AND truthful - sort of a universal<br /><br />relationship of souls connecting post tragedy<br /><br />of this size and strength.<br /><br />Finally - I enjoyed reading the Preface, the<br /><br />Author's Note and the Director's Note. It<br /><br />felt almost sacred to hear how this very vital<br /><br />piece of theatre, and literature, came into<br /><br />being.<br /><br />I would love to see it performed somewhere.<br /><br />Ah, to be so blessed.	2005-07-10

The last time I cried when I turned the final page of a book was Natalie Goldberg's \\"Writing Down the Bones.\\"  Julia Cameron's \\"Letters to a Young Artist\\" is quite different than Goldberg's work.... But the emotion was the same.  \\"I was having so much fun `being with you', Julia - please don't stop now!\\"<br /><br />I am a long-term fan of Julia Cameron. The first time I read \\"The Artist's Way\\" it was because so many of my coaching clients were fans. The one thing about that book that bothered me was what I perceived as Cameron's whiny voice.  I have really enjoyed watching her evolve through her follow-up books  - and her tone shifting along the way.<br /><br />In \\"Letters\\" her ton shifts from the beginning of the letters to \\"X\\" as she goes along. I liken her tone to Simon Cowell of American Idol... because she tells the truth without any sugar coating... so it might make some readers angry.<br /><br />My recommendation is to look underneath those first appearances of temperament - and read the incredible truths which pour out of these pages - nearly every page of my copy is underlined and dog eared.<br /><br />Listen:  \\"Making art takes guts. Choosing to be vulnerable and exposed rather that safely blocked is a risky venture. The ultimate reward, however, is truly great art.\\"  (p. 9)<br /><br />\\"Cultivate an attitude of expectancy, for it's expectancy that keeps us alert and optimisti. Attention and optimism are necessary to the long haul.\\" (pg. 61).<br /><br />\\"Art is a spiritual calling, and like any vocation it is subject to the dark night of the soul.\\" P. 94<br /><br />\\"There is one trick to setting goals, I think. And that is to always leave enough breathing room for the divine to enter.\\"  (p. 138)<br /><br />Now you can see why I cried. This book is absolutely incredible and has been my almost constant companion, always open, since I read it the first time. It is literally packed with thoughts to prompt both my writing and my creative process.<br /><br />This is a book which would make Rainer Rilke proud - I get the feeling he would suggest we live the questions this book evokes - not judge the book on its tone, instead allow the truths within to take us on a journey through our days.<br /> <br />This is a book which would make Rainer Rilke proud - I get the feeling he would suggest we live the questions this book evokes - not judge the book on its tone, instead allow the truths within to take us on a journey through our days. <br />	2005-05-14

It provides questions, checklists - ideas for inspiration and small areas to write - but it doesn't deliver what the title infers.<br /><br />What it does do is break your life into several chunks by age - and then after \\"Coming of Age\\" and \\"Coming into Your Own\\" is the most excellent chapter - \\"Self Realization\\" and then it ends.<br /><br />Childhood and Adolescence are each as long as \\"the rest of your life\\" - which disappointed me and made me wonder about the age of the author.<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen more inspiration for the writing itself - and some basic tidbits about the writing process. To its credit, the book suggests three different methods for gleaning details of your life - and then it stops.<br /><br />It is like a meal that is missing the main course.<br /><br />The salad is there, there is a side dish - maybe even a roll or two - but the main course is missing. Your stomach is still growling and you are being ushered out the door. The salad may have been tasty and the side dish savory and yet... there is still something missing.<br /><br />I appreciate the attempt - and hope this one is fleshed out more on a revised edition.	2005-04-04

With one of the most scintillating first sentences I have read in a long time (I won't give it away) how could I not be curious to know more about Tory Bodeen and her keen sixth sense or her friend Hope and the aftermath of what happened the summer they were both eight years old?<br /><br />I actually put this book down for an entire week (yes, life gets busy!) and when I picked it back up was ready for the ending I expected.<br /><br />Roberts didn't stoop to that: instead, she wove the threads in a completely different direction than I was expecting. When I got to the \\"surprise within a surprise\\" I was let down at first, thinking \\"formula!\\" but then that evaporated into more delightful nuances.<br /><br />I enjoyed the backdrops - Tory's store opening, the small, southern hamlet \\"Progress\\" and the variety of supportive characters throughout the book.<br /><br />This is a winner on many planes - and if you are a writer, read this one simply to watch a mastercraftswoman in action, whether you usually read books like this or not, you will find value here.	2005-03-29

He uses the metaphor of a simple coin flip and the \\"two potentials morphing into one\\" - to explain the \\"factual\\" taking form in a simple turn of events.<br /><br />I was afraid this would be a book that pointed at the \\"what is wrong\\" with life.<br /><br />Instead, Roese teaches the reader how to move from \\"woe is me\\" into (in the words of Thoreau which are in the book) \\"making the most of your regrets, never smother sorrow, but tend and cherish it until it comes to have a separate and integral interest. To regret deeply is to live afresh.\\"<br /><br />A-ha, I said, as I read along nodding.<br /><br />I also appreciated the balance of half of the book being explanations and examples and half the book being \\"putting counterfactuals to work for you.\\"<br /><br />Sometimes books like this explain it all and then do very little with application.<br /><br />This book really assists and empowers the reader to apply what they have learned.<br /><br />My favorite quote in the book is \\"Neglecting the messages of your own emotions can mean persisting in counterproductive behaviors and missing unique opportunities for growth and renewel.\\"<br /><br />YES! No more denial of emotions, instead - we learn how to use them positively through what Roese calls, harnessing regret to create new action rather than suppressing regret.<br /><br />Yes, I am convinced - more of us need to read and embrace this message.	2005-03-22

I have had great experience listening to people I know and admire - that is how I found Julia Cameron, for example - who has gone on to be instrumental in my own personal growth.<br /><br />In this case, I found my thoughts and experiences do not gel with as much of what Debbie Ford says - and I found the presentation of the content to be a bit jarring.<br /><br />I discovered I didn't have problems with most of the message of this book, it was more its presentation and organization that I found to be outside the helpful, positive range.<br /><br />The book opens with very familiar content, with material from a Tony Robbins quiote, \\"Quality questions create a quality life.\\"  I agree - wholeheartedly.  It felt rather \\"status quo, here I am reading another main-stream motivational book\\" and then Ford takes the leap into Spirituality, with a lot of talk about one's star, life force and flame. Again, I appreciate Spirituality... so aside from the sort of un-gentle glide, I was ok with this content.<br /><br />She wrote about Amma, a spiritual leader I have heard others experience, and I thought that was pretty cool so I kept reading and as I did I became less and less comfortable - and more and more curious about what makes so many people so appreciative of this book?<br /><br />If you like things like \\"Choices that DIM YOUR LIFE versus CHOICES THAT MAKE YOUR FIRE ROAR\\" you will appreciate this book.<br /><br />If you believe in by-passing emotion - you will appreciate this book.<br /><br />And that is where I shut this book - because as an active creator/performer/writer, I simply can not bypass emotion.  I can bypass opinion, but I can not bypass the truth within my emotion and the message within my emotion.<br /><br />For me, that is what was the clincher or the \\"final straw\\" so to speak which would keep me from making a recommendation of this particular title.

Alison Smith courageously puts her story out there in a clean, concise and often connecting manner that simply says, \\"Here is what happened.\\" - and we, the readers, get to witness the unfolding right before our eyes, our hearts and our spirit.<br /><br />We read of the three years between the time of young Roy's death and when Alison reaches the age Roy was when he died - and then lives beyond him... something that we can intuitively understand is among the most difficult aspects of being a surviving sibling for her to face.<br /><br />Alison became \\"The One Whose Brother Died\\". Her community supported her and yet, allowed her to starve herself and not sleep and withdraw. I loved the section where her mother discovered the work of Kubler-Ross and attempted to get Alison and her very religious, ritualistic husband to share their feelings about Roy's death and their survival - but neither would budge.<br /><br />There isn't a trace of judgment in the tone of this book - it is vibrantly fresh and true.<br /><br />One note of interest: I was grateful I started the book in the back - in the Interview with the Author.  It gave insight into Alison and made me smile in recognition.... It was like I was rooting for her and for this book and for myself... if she can do it, I can (and YOU can), too.	2005-03-08

Her sense of humor and joy for life shines through each of the stories which are presented as the whole of her writing life.<br /><br />I have never read any of her fiction, yet now I am so compelled by her words that I know there is much more to her than \\"Sagwa\\" the PBS Children's Show based on the character she created (also the name of a cat in her life.)<br /><br />Each essay could easily be read on its own, although I found myself breezing through the book from cover-to-cover in less than a week even with a heavy reading schedule. They were ALL intriguing - from reading of her youth to reading of her challenges with her health later in life to reading about her surprising syncronicities and muses - to being a \\"Cliff Notes\\" subject....<br /><br />This book would be great reading for anyone who enjoys humorous self reflection though it would be especially great for any fledgling writers out there.<br /><br />Tan shares one question she asks regularly, \\"What happened?\\" and I have found it to be a great scene mover, especially in the script I am writing.	2005-02-21

My friend and fellow writer, Greg Goodsell, liked to read Sylvia Plath's work at  the Open Mic's we attended. I would hear her name and think, \\"I am so woefully under-educated in these classics.\\" For the past few years I have set to righting that wrong.<br /><br />Sylvia Plath's tale of Esther Greenwood's stumble into insanity mirrors her own journey in many uncanny ways.  It is not unlike the words of Virginia Woolf who wrote \\"\\"If one shuts one's eyes and thinks of the novel as a whole, it would seem to be a creation owning a certain looking-glass likeness to life.\\"<br /><br />Esther's life mirrors not only Plath's life, it also mirrors many others of us who have experienced depression.  The voice is as clear and familiar as the rooms in my home - known intimately through daily experience.  Plath's writing is evocative, clear and haunting.<br /><br />We are witness to Esther's journey first as an intern at a woman's magazine - a highly coveted position - to her tumble into deep depression, hospitalization, and return to \\"the outside\\".  We witness her continued losses (one of her friends succumbs to suicide, her experience of shock treatment, her first love relationships.<br /><br />My favorite lines in the montage of tremendous lines  are these, both from the final chapter::<br /><br />\\"A fresh fall of snow blanketed the asylum grounds, not a Christmas sprinkle, but a man-high January deluge, the sort tha snuffs out schools and offices and churches, and leaves, for a day or more, a pure, blank sheet in place of memo pads, date books and calendars.\\"<br /><br />\\"I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart.  I am, I am, I am....\\"<br /><br />This book is now used in many classrooms.  This is a very good thing, to explore insanity as well as witness a writer capable of creating such beauty and at the same time, not being able to continue with her own life.<br /><br />I would also suggest readers study Plath's poetry, my favorite collection being \\"Ariel\\".  Finally, if you are especially taken with the life of Sylvia Plath, there is a DVD you may want to rent starring Gwyneth Paltrow in the lead role and is entitled \\"Sylvia.\\"  I found it to be highly telling and entertaining.r /> <br />I would also suggest readers study Plath's poetry, my favorite collection being \\"Ariel\\".

Borysenko writes with a friend-like, compassionate voice as she guides the reader into a more centered life style.<br /><br />The strategies discussed won't be new for those \\"experienced\\" at Personal Development AND the presentation makes it worth the investment.  Each idea is narrowed down so succinctly and at the same time, the resulting \\"a-ha's\\" have the possibility of being substantial for those who take the principles and put them into practice.<br /><br />I love how personable Joan comes across - in the section on perfectionism she describes how she still deals with it in her life through a story from a recent holiday dinner. Her chapter on \\"Breath\\" is so simple and yes, so powerful.  These happen to be my favorites, but each lesson has gold to be mined.<br /><br />For those folks who don't want to do the lessons \\"one-a-week\\", the book could easily be opened to any page, read and applied in that moment.  The chapterettes can literally be read while waiting in line at the grocery store so there is no reason NOT to live more peacefully now -<br /><br />There - see how effortless that was? *Smile* Reading and using this book is even easier than reading this review....

God first, Family second, then the 3-P's with Commitment being fleshed out as purpose, ideals, goals, integrity, truth and follow through as well as that also tiny bit annoying \\"you gotta wanna!\\".<br /><br />I would suggest reading this book for everyone simply because the information is solid, it is familiar enough and reinforces a lot of what you may already know and that you haven't yet tied together.<br /><br />There are enough Bobs in the world - lets introduce them to this book and see what happens.	2004-12-22

Todd Michael takes the very familiar New Testament Story of Jesus feeding the 5,000 and outlines the 12 conditions that made this miracle possible and then takes those conditions and explains how to apply those conditions to create miracles of your own.<br /><br />The tone is that of a well-loved teacher or guide.  I am thinking of some of the movies I have scene with a teacher from an exclusive school in New England - Mr. Hundert from the Emperor's Club comes to mind.  Michael bolsters his discoveries with references from Strong's Exhaustive Concordance and has obviously spent a lot of time really digging deeply into the material.<br /><br />His focus is on the greater good of others, strong on a service attitude. His advice in the Receiving Chapter is to releases something - anything - thus activating an opening for you to receive.<br /><br />He outlines the 12 Miracle Conditions and then takes it one step further (of critical importance) and that is activating the miracle conditions through application and meditation.<br /><br />Here is my favorite quote from the book, since it strongly supports my own belief:<br /><br />\\"The less a vacuum contains - the emptier it is - the more powerful the attractive force it exerts on the surrounding world.\\"  (This explains the releasing in the receiving chapter I mentioned earlier.)<br /><br />The weakness of the book is the lopsided content within the Conditions. \\"Engaging\\" contained only 6 pages (!)  It is one of the later chapters. Earlier chapters were 16 pages, 12 pages, with the opening chapter being a whopping 32 pages.<br /><br />It almost felt like he was pushing a deadline - so the later and equally significant chapters were comparatively rather shallow.

In writing this review, I have been sometimes challenged to harken back to the pure strengths of this book in specifics. I have scribbled notes to myself in the margins, noted great quotes within, and yet I think the best way to really grasp the gloriousness of this book is to simply get your hands on it and read it yourself. I know I will be re-reading it, re-reading it and re-reading it.<br /><br />It is the sort of book you can pick up and open in any section and find something valuable whether it is a story or an example or a simple application.<br /><br /> \\"Love\\" has been a tremendously successful book - indeed, Buscaglia had 5 books on the New York Times best seller list at once - people (even those who found him \\"odd\\") craved what he taught. Those lessons come through loud and clear in this relatively compact treatise which was inspired from the lectures and student contact from the course he taught at a California (naturally, perhaps some of you are thinking) University.<br /><br />Each chapter offers the reader the opportunity to plunge headlong into the topic of love: we come to know that love is a learned phenomenon, that there are strong forces which keep us from experiencing - and giving and receiving love.  We discover the importance of loving ourselves and how to begin to activate that process.<br /><br />I found the most effective chapter to be \\"Love Recognizes Needs\\" because it shares examples of the ways in which we can simply, easily and (dare I say it?) even methodically become more aware and give love more readily to others AND receive love more readily for ourselves.<br /><br />I wish I had known of Leo Buscaglia when he was still living. His message is simple and profound, it is grace-filled and warm - and in his writing and life he seems to have been capable of living without concern about what \\"mainstream thinkers\\" thought of him.<br /><br />On page 89, Buscaglia quotes Thornton Wilder - and this quote really says all that needs to be said about reading and applying the lessons from this book:<br /><br />\\"There is a land of the living and a land of the dead. The bridge is love.\\"to be said about reading and applying the lessons from this book: <br /> <br />\\"There is a land of the living and a land of the dead. The bridge is love.\\"  <br />	2004-12-11

I pulled it off the shelf and held it in my hands like a sacred instrument of sorts. It was heavy and had the appearance of an art history book or a coffee table book, only in this volume, the artistry celebrated is that of intuition - specifically, intuition guided by the Divine - to create a life of wonder, richness, intention and naturally, intuition.<br /><br />It is filled with fill in the blank contemplative exercises and assessments, beautiful art, evocative questions and beautiful quotations you will want to write in your own quote notebook if you have one.<br /><br />I only wish their was more white space, only that might make the book more pricey.  (That was another huge surprise - when I felt it in my hands I thought \\"oh, this is an expensive one and was shocked to see it wasn't expensive at all!)<br /><br />Lynn Robinson writes in a way that you feel as if you are sitting having a delicious meal and glass of wine with a friend - perhaps with instrumental music softly playing in the background and perhaps other wonderfully connected people sharing your journey.<br /><br />Even if you think you have \\"read it all\\" in the \\"Create a Life You Love\\" or \\"Intuition for Spiritual People\\" you will really find a gem in this book - for the sensory delight if nothing else.<br /><br />Revel in this one.	2004-12-10

Each month  of the year has a guideline, some interesting content with fun facts like James Michener started writing at age 40 and easy to follow tips of the month.<br /><br />There is a writing prompt for every day of the year. No writer would be lost for ideas with this book close at hand. I can see myself using it and re-using it and re-using it.<br /><br />Reeves comes across as a writing buddy sharing thoughts and guidance in perfectly reasonable and re-readable doses.	2004-12-08

I started highlighting parts that spoke to me personally and I realized I would have highlighted almost the entire book if I kept it up, so I chose to highlight only the MOST significant parts to me.... (I ended up underlining a bunch of passages, starring some others, writing in the front pages where more than 25 highly acclaimed sources from across the globe sing their praises for this timeless novel.<br /><br />The story of \\"The Alchemist\\" focuses on a boy we first meet as a Shepherd named Santiago.  He could be you or me, but for that first moment, he is purely 100% himself - and we, as readers, experience his transformation as he lives his Personal Legend.<br /><br />Santiago meets many wise people and other beings  - disguised as \\"ordinary\\" who speak to him - in the language of the soul of the world.<br /><br />He learns from his sheep, the desert, an Englishman, a tired-grovely crystal merchant. He learns from thieves, he learns from the sky, he learns from putting one foot in front of the other.<br /><br />This tenth anniversary edition also includes a Reader's Guide and Discussion guide (which I will use individually for my second reading of this book.)<br /><br />The book wraps spirituality, humor, history, entrepreneurialism and more into one simple, satisfying package.<br /><br />Here are some of my personal favorite quotes from its pages:<br /><br />\\"The horizon was tinged with red, and suddenly the sun appeared. The boy thought back to that conversation with his father and felt happy. He had already seen many castles. He owned a jacket, a book he could trade for another, and a flock of sheep. But most important, he was able every day to live out his dream.  I couldn't have found God in the seminary, he thought, as he looked at the sunrise.\\" P. 10<br /><br />\\"But the sheep had taught him something even more important: there was a language in the world that everyone understood, a language the boy had used throughout the time he was trying to improve things at the shop. It was the language of enthusiasm, of things accomplished with love and purpose, as part of a search for something he believed in and desired.\\" P. 62<br /><br />\\"I had to test your courage,\\"  the stranger said, \\"Courage is the quality most essential to understanding the Language of the World.\\" P. 111<br /><br />\\"That's the principle that governs all things,\\" he said.  \\"In alchemy, it's called the Soul of the World. When you want something with all your heart, that's when you are closest to the Soul of the World. It is always a positive force.\\" P. 78<br /><br />Read this book. Read it again.

In a nutshell, they are ask -always work beyond expectation;  Get the Word Out; and Stay With It.)<br /><br />The content is mostly based on selling a physical product, one at a time (like the author sells cars, one at a time to one customer at a time)the lessons could be applicable in other areas as well.	2004-12-06

I appreciate the \\"12.5\\" number of principles Gitomer uses (different, again)... which he suggests the reader read once and then review and apply.<br /><br />The reader could literally take this captivating book and create his or her own course of selling study from the pages within. Gitomer's enthusiastic voice rings off the pages and while I don't always appreciate his exact lessons, I find myself liking him.<br /><br />If he tried to sell me something, I know I would at least take my time to look if not buy right away.  That alone is worth the price of a selling book to me.<br /><br />I don't always agree with what Jeffery Gitomer says, but I really enjoy his writing. Not only that, he is downright likeable.

I love the first line of this book: \\"Where does a story truly begin? In life, there are seldom clear cut beginnings, those moments when we can, in looking back, say that everything started.\\"  I read that sentence and sighed deeply - gorgeous beginning.<br /><br />Most of the book followed with a satisfying flavor - I enjoyed the characters and recognized many of the familiar components in this genre.  Tough, macho yet vulnerable strong guy with a difficult and heartbroken past (naturally a widower from childhood sweetheart wife), Miles Ryan and nightmare bearing, loveable soccer playing son, Jonah Miles,  child meets smart, beautiful yet sadly divorced (who could have let her go?) second grade teacher, Sarah Andrews.<br /><br />We can all predict what will follow.<br /><br />I had somehow figured out the \\"who-dun-it\\" right as the character who did it came into clear focus.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the writing and the characters were so good, I kept going.<br /><br />The part that I simply couldn't continue reading was Miles' obsession and hatred of the community thugs with whom he has a lifelong rivalry.  Otis, Otis, Otis.  The scenes involving Otis and his brothers could all have been nixed for my reading, though I realize they are another common element of the genre..... to me, they added unnecessary pages in a 368 page book.  I bet they would be fun to cast if this title is made into a movie, like some of author Nicholas Sparks other books.<br /><br />The words in this book are wonderfully crafted. For that, I give 5 Stars. The execution - not as good to me - I give three stars.... Which is why I come out with a 4 rating.  If you are interested in writing this genre, read it.  Learn from the artistry of the words within.  If you want to be entertained by engaging characters, read about Sarah. Jonah, Miles and their supporting folks (Sarah's parents, Brenda, etc) and when you see Otis and \\"the boys\\" show up, skip it.....	2004-11-26

I had really looked forward to hearing Schneider's take in Chapter 9: The Ethical Questions: Spirituality, Privacy and Politics.  I wasn't sure why or how Spirituality fit into that equation, and I still don't after reading the chapter.<br /><br />In re-reading it, I see how Schneider speaks of \\"ethical questions in writing will of necessity touch our most primal spiritual orientation\\" so seeing that, perhaps the chapter would have been better titled differently.  Even so, it doesn't detract from the content of the book, it is simply a moment of saying \\"Hmmm. That is interesting. I wonder what is up with that?\\"<br /><br />I can not recommend this book highly enough for all writers at all stages of creative growth. It is expansive and expanding, intriguing and evocative.

I really wanted to check my vocabulary with that of a respectable high school senior.<br /><br />It was eye-opening to say the least.  The last time I was in a conventional classroom was upon receiving my bachelor's degree twenty years ago..... and I wondered if I had been adequately introduced to these words then... or not?<br /><br />(It reminds me of the line Tom Hanks speaks in \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" - \\"I don't even want to think about what they are not teaching you in school.\\")<br /><br />I knew some words well - like oligarchy and usurp and feckless.  I patted myself on the back in that moment.<br /><br />I had been able to sort of \\"get\\" inculcate (to impress upon the mind of another by frequent instruction) but on the other hand, I had no idea what nanotechnology meant nor did I know much about the word \\"evanescent\\" except for some songs made popular by a band called \\"Evanescence\\" which I now can tell you means \\"vanishing like vapors.\\"<br /><br />The book includes an occasional quote from thinkers and writers which incorporates the word being stressed.  My favorites included Willa Cather and Thomas Hobbes.<br /><br />I noticed from visiting here at Amazon there is also a version of this book for college freshmen. I think my seventh grade daughter and I will start with that volume (a word a day) and work up to this one.<br /><br />Not only was it educational, it was enjoyable - a significant combination.	2004-08-20

What could delight a pre-schooler/kindergartner more? VERY LITTLE!<br /><br />The illustrations are colorful and SOOOO expressive. I think some of the children from my kindergarten class 35 years ago are caught forever in these pages, as are the children from MY children's classes....<br /><br />I just wish my kindergarten teacher, Miss Wick, was more like the teacher Deborah Lee Rose creatd for us.<br /><br />Brava - beautifully crafted.....	2004-08-19

What does it smell like?\\" and as a parent-reader you can go more deeply as the child grows older.<br /><br />The photos are amazing - nice and large -<br /><br />Some of the poets included are Yeats, Tennessee Williams, Shakespeare and Steve Crow - who wrote one of my favorite pieces which goes like this: \\"Snow is a mind falling, a continuous breath of climbs, loops, spirals dips into the eart like white fireflies\\".....<br /><br />Not quite Mother Goose ...... and equally as beloved for your children once they are introduced to it.	2004-08-19

Beautiful acetone pages teach little readers about the plants underwater and how the fish creatively camouflage themselves to stay safe.<br /><br />Carle's signature style of illustration captures the delight of my children and of me, too.<br /><br />I personally laughed at the \\"babysitting\\" comment of one of the fish dads. How many times have I heard my friends complaining about fathers terming the time they spend alone with their children as \\"babysitting\\"?<br /><br />Perfect time for the parent reading the book to laugh with the child and say \\"He isn't babysitting, he is Daddying!\\"<br /><br />I learned a couple great \\"fishy\\" lessons from this colorful book.  Great to read after watching \\"Finding Nemo.\\" another favorite in my family.	2004-08-18

Books	4	7	7	N	N	Worthwhile Reading, Especially for Fellow Actors	While this is not the most tightly woven book I have ever read, I always enjoy reading about the life journey and current thoughts of an actor.  I especially respect Kelsey Grammer's long run as Frasier Crane.<br /><br />Though this memoir, we learn of the details of Grammer's life and also his life philosophy.  We hear the truth behind the Hollywood gossip.  We also hear the heart behind the actor and the character we have come to know from our weekly \\"visits\\".<br /><br />This book and Grammer's work itself taught me a lot about the power of comedy, and how as an actor, comedy is not as easy as it looks... and yes, it is as significant as high drama.<br /><br />It can be read very quickly - as an actor as well I try to read as much as I can from other actors.  This is a book that can be shared and enjoyed by many.	2004-08-13

I don't read much fiction so when I find a book I that really holds my attention like \\"Temporary Sanity\\" did, I take special note.<br /><br />The whole book was woven together very well - I enjoyed each character - even the ones who were created especially so we would be frustrated with them.<br /><br />Marty is very likeable as the able and highly intuitive defense attorney with a heart.  I can imagine the small firm she works in is actually a positive place to hang your hat.  (This must be fiction *smiling*.)<br /><br />Not only is the writing thoroughly engaging and entertaining, the subject matter is one we can all relate to - in all its horrifying glory.<br /><br />What worked especially well was the ending. I had no clue what was coming.  I love when I am taken by surprise like this - kudos to Rose Connors for pulling off such a delightful conclusion.	2004-08-13

I almost didn't read this one because I thought, \\"oh, man, I am not in the mood for a romance novel\\" but this book read as a romance novel plus a lot more.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the author's voice as he explored and \\"lived in\\" the life of Jesse and Mickey.  His tone was realistic - and I heard some of myself in his thoughts and phrasings. Jesse was especially multi-dimensional.<br /><br />Also, the exploration of family was excellent - again, especially from Jesse's perspective.<br /><br />It also reminded me there are many stories within our family tree that are not \\"open\\" that would fascinate us - and remind us of the uniqueness of these people with whom we share our blood lines.<br /><br />There are some of the usual \\"romance-novel\\" aspects of this book as well, but for the most part I found it deliciously, perfectly unconventionally conventional.	2004-08-13

There it sat, on a shelf at my parent's house while I was on vacation and the next thing I knew I had not put the darn thing down.... .<br /><br />The tight, engaging writing of Jill Marie Landis was coated in magical dust which seemed to intoxicate me.  There was a bit of \\"swirlyness\\" as I wondered to myself \\"is this a suspense, crime type book or is this a romance novel?\\" yet Landis managed to bring it back to focus, mostly because of the characters of Carly and Jake.<br /><br />The other \\"characters\\" which I found to work so well were the \\"character\\" of Carly's art and the fictitious village of \\"Twilight Cove\\".  I found myself reveling in the simple descriptions and the house Jake was planning to restore was an excellent metaphor for Carly's life - although that restoration, wisdom tells us and Carly shows us, will come from one source only - herself.	2004-08-13

Every time I pick up anything by Rilke I am astounded.<br />I read these works and think, \\"This is a diary? What if people, years from now published my morning pages notebooks? Hardly the beauty found here.\\"<br />AND yet in Rilke's words, I find an appreciation not only for him, for his art, for the people who populated his life experience - I also find an extreme appreciation for the connection we all share.<br />What is exceptionally invigorating about these Diaries is their wide variety of creative expression. There are poems - there are pieces of short fiction - there is a sort of travel narrative and art criticism.<br />Unlike another reader, I found it highly personal.... Like stepping into the pages of anyone's diary is highly personal.<br />I found myself singing songs of gratitude for the fact his diaries were saved so that we could enjoy them today, more than one hundred years later.<br />Ironic and perfect, given that final appraisal by me, to hear this one quote from this book which really sums up Rilke's reflection of life from his pen - \\"Whoever understands and honors Death grants Life greatness.\\"	2004-07-19

Carolyn See writes \\"Making a Literary Life\\" directly from her heart.  Naturally, then, it is angled from her particular point of view and has suggestions some of the other reviewers might find a bit unattractive - and what I read in her words was this:  Create your life as a writer who is fully herself.<br />If that \\"fully herself\\" means writing personal notes - so be it.  (I think this is something which sets a writer apart. I know as a publisher and editor who occasionally receives hand written notes.... They stand out from the onslaught of form letters, hastily scribed emails, etc.)<br />What is YOUR \\"fully yourself\\" action or practice which makes YOU are writer and forms YOUR literary life?<br />See glides through her examples with heartfulness, with truth, with integrity and with a wry sense of humor which helps you to say \\"Thank goodness she is human, and just like me... and survived being obsessed with the written word.\\"<br />My favorite words in this entire book are these: \\"We live in a beautiful, sentient universe that yearns for you to tell the truth about it. If you love this world and this craft, they will lift you to a place you can't begin to imagine.\\"<br />The writers who \\"get\\" those words will enjoy this work.  Those writers who don't understand those words might be disappointed upon reading this book.<br />My heart-hope is you will both believe those words and live those words as you create your literary life.	2004-07-06

I will be perpetually grateful to my friend who introduced me to Mary Oliver's work.  I was so excited to read she had released another book I could not wait to get my hands on it.  The Amazon box arrived and I excitedly tore it open and began to read.<br />Exquisite.  One simple word to describe Mary Oliver's work.<br />I enjoy her poetry and her books about how to write poetry so I was curious about how this mostly essay book would fare.<br />I was not disappointed.<br />A couple of the chapters wobbled very slightly: I was curious about the inclusion of the previously published essays on Emerson and Hawthorne. While they were interesting, they seemed a bit out of place with the other chapters.<br />I especially appreciated the peek into parts of the author's personal life that I had not been privy to in the past.  I loved witnessing more of her life, connecting to the stories and nodding my head as she observed the day unfold about her.<br />My favorite quote from the book goes like this:<br />\\"It is the intimate, never the general, that is teacherly.  The idea of love is not love. The idea of the ocean is neither salt nor sand; the face of the seal cannot rise from the idea to stare at you, to astound your heart.\\"<br />Ahhhh - yes!<br />The book is short - only 101 pages - and I know I will read it again and again and again and hope Mary Oliver blesses us with another book soon.	2004-07-05

I facilitate a popular prosperity class so I like to keep myself abreast of all the prosperity books which blossom forth, especially those which take a spiritual approach.<br />I have not been a Sark reader to this point although I was vaguely aware of her work as \\"the author whose books look almost like a very colorful journal\\" and kind of dismissed them as not being \\"meaty\\" enough for my usually taste.<br />What I found from this particular title is Sark is plenty meaty after all, she just provides her meal in a way that makes the digestion much easier - much less of a work out for the reader.<br />I found myself laughing out loud and nodding in recognition as I read Sark's words and I even found she uses a word I thought I had made up: \\"enoughness\\" - as I am so likely to say \\"Syncronicity rocks!\\" (in more ways than one!)<br />The Self Love chapter is absolutely excellent - very simple and also very profound.<br />I also appreciate Sark's take on dropping incessant inquiry and analysis and the idea of giving ourselves the gift of what we seek from others.<br />These two gems are worth more than gold in my book - and I certainly will be passing along these thoughts to my students and clients.<br />Thank you - to Sark - I know my experience of YOU has expanded as my experience of the Prosperity Pie (expanding all good things) has grown as a result of actually reading your book instead of skimming and rejecting.	2004-06-28

Your need and longing and the ability to express yourself will come back. Like love, you can't force it. Like love, it will find you when it's ready.&quot;<br />and<br />&quot;When you write, you need to have a certain willingness inside you, an auto induced mood of simultaneous quiet and energetic readiness that lets your imagination know its ok to come out now.&quot;<br />Berg is primarily a fiction writer, so she writes a lot about topics which would be especially beneficial for writers of fiction.<br />All in all a respectable, decent read but not among my favorites.	2004-06-04

This book reminds me of a Workshop in a Book.  The author suggests the reader first go through the first two chapters \\"Before You Start\\" and \\"Starting\\" and then, feel more free to \\"hop scotch\\" through the other chapters... actually, I added the hop scotch part, but hopefully you get the metaphor within the Life Writing review.<br />Strengths of this book include the check lists, the plethora of exercises to support your writing process.  It definitely inspires action rather than just READING about memoir writing, if you follow through the book and work as you go, you will get your stories out and into tangible form.<br />I appreciated quotes from many writers who I admire such as Natalie Goldberg and Rainer Rilke.<br />The weaknesses of the book are the lay out (I would prefer a more spacious feeling - perhaps by taking out some of the workshop examples and allowing the reader/writer to be inspired by his/her own process instead) and some of the tone, which I could see bringing blocks to the writer (see, for example, the discussion of \\"Truth\\" and \\"Facts.\\")<br />I also notice and wanted to inform you there is also a strong sense of this book being a sales piece for the Soleil Network and the Workshops run by the author.  Notes at the end - resources perhaps, would be fitting.... But there were these notices, and inserts, and the lengthy workshop examples..... so just to let you know that is there in case that is something that would get in the way of receiving full value for you.	2004-04-23

I sat at the bookstore reading this book and nodding, saying \\"Yes, this author knows! He gets it, he gets it!\\"<br />Peter Block asks the important questions, gives pearls of wisdom highlighted among the content.  He clearly understands what he is facing and moves the reader easily into seeing solutions which work and those which are simply adding more of the \\"old ways\\" of coercion, patriarchy and adding more \\"disease\\" to the organization instead of the RECREATION which will move the organization to its highest level possible.<br />This quote from Chapter 15 Sums up Block's attitude and approach... and had me want to stand on the table and applaud.<br />\\"If we took responsibility for our freedom, committed ourselves to service and had faith that our security lay within ourselves, we could stop asking the question, \\"HOW?\\" we would see that we have the answer.  In every case the answer to the question, \\"How\\" is YES.

I was thrilled to find this expansive volume of poetry which all my children - ages three through 12 - could equally enjoy.  The mini-biographies of many of the poets provide an excellent source of further exploration into the individual lives of the poets.<br />The way the poems are separated also provide a means for additional conversation with children.  The sections are diverse (from Poems about Nature, Poems about Family, Poems that Tell Stories, and Poems to Ponder) again will appeal to children of different age groups and for different reasons.<br />Excellent for home school parents and as a bridge from Mother Goose to more advanced poetry for the older pre-school aged child.  The illustrations, like many of the poems, are classics - familiar color plates as well as simple line drawings in an old fashioned style.	2004-04-11

Doyle gently teaches the readers how to get over this hurdle of \\"secretly believing we would only succeed by suffering.\\"<br />She sends a newsflash: \\"The difference between people who achieved billionaire status and mere millionaire status is that the billionaires LOVE what they do\\".<br />This topic is critically important for all, men and women alike and across faiths. I didn't pick this up because I was a fan of Doyle's, although I can see she likes to be controversial from the other titles she has written.<br />I am grateful to see this topic is being addressed: may we give and receive bountifully starting with the simple lessons contained here.

Mr. Epstein's passion for his subject was the first attractor for me upon reading this well written, intriguing biography of Edna St. Vincent Millay, specifically focusing on her very tumultuous love life and the poetry which was birthed due to her romantic and [physical relations].<br />The prose reads like Mr. Epstein has fallen in love with Edna just as the many men in her path fell in love with her.<br />I also found the diversions which came later (like the horse Chaladon) and her well known descent into alcoholism and drug addiction were very compelling to dive into: I would have appreciated more of these times, although the limited documentation available would explain why there isn't more information here.<br />This book does its job well: makes me more curious about Edna St. Vincent Millay: from her poetry, her plays and her life outside the written word.	2004-04-10

I read this book expecting to learn about metrical poetry: kind of the basics of how they work, how they are constructed.<br />I didn't expect spiritual and personal growth lessons.<br />Needless to say, I was delighted to be fed on so many different levels.  Given Mary Oliver is the author, I shouldn't be surprised.....<br />I also wasn't expecting to be so compelled to try on the metrical form by reading this book yet I am! And the great thing is I am also learning (through practice) the freedom and spiritual side of writing \\"according to form and rhythm\\".<br />Highly recommended to poets and anyone who loves a poet or the written word.	2004-04-10

I was thinking, \\"This will all be old hat, I am sure\\" until I saw the authors include the staff from The Poetry Center in San Francisco.<br />What poet or poet-in-the-making doesn't nod, smile and point when we read this affirmation?  \\"Poetry has more meaning, music and emotion per words, per syllable, per letter than any other kind of writing.\\"  (I could have sworn I heard an \\"Amen!\\" from the crowd or maybe... that was me.)<br />The book also includes some very valuable appendices with websites and poetry organizations.<br />Excellent resource for all poets and the people who love them.

In the section on \\"Anorexia of language, why we can't write\\" which personifies silence in this way.  \\"I have been staring into silence's blank face all month and I want to rattle it, to shake it, to force it to confess what's at its obsessive, fanatical core.\\"<br />There is also a lot of ripeness in the chapter on Envy: the Writer's vocational hazard.

From the very opening pages (where we learn why blondes are tow-heads....from the explanation I wonder why they weren't called \\"Flax Heads\\" Ah, well.<br />What really got me going with this book, though, is Kyff's suggestion that the reader consider reading the book as \\"entering a room filled with intriguing people.\\"  As a word lover, this is a concept I can completely understand: after all, aren't words purely intriguing people?<br />I sat in my seat, nodding in surprise to find \\"winging it\\" was not in the same vein as literally \\"flying by the seat of my pants\\" instead it comes from a stage and performance root - unprepared actors would have someone in the wings prompting them with their lines. Laziness lead to \\"winging it\\" because there was no other preparation.<br />I can somehow picture a cow with aching feet when I learned \\"tender foot\\" actually comes from importing cattle who didn't fare too well on the \\"rough\\" colonial terrain... that is until they got used to it.<br />Wow your friends and romance your word loving spirit through this engaging and mind stretching volume.	2004-03-16

Is that all women care about? Not this one.<br />Gaffney has an exceptional talent for inhabiting the mind of her characters and speaking distinctively as she writes each character.<br />All three protagonists in this novel are strong, complex, likeable and dislikeable.<br />All three are real.<br />All three are dealing with a variety of players, different challenges in different stages of life.  It was effortless to feel compassion, anger, laugh and cry with each of them.<br />While the main point of the book is to be a study of the relationship of three generations of women in the same family, I saw it as an additionally strong study in personal evolution through challenging situations and everyday situations.<br />I saw the responses as realistically human just as each character was realistically human.<br />Some examples of Gaffney's word weavings which I found especially enjoyable:<br />page 66:<br />\\"Brian's job becoming, at least it had accomplished what my mother, guilt over Ruth, and 50 milligrams of Zoloft hadn't been able to: my return to the real world.  Half of me might be in the ether, zoned out and inattentive, mired in the old grief and guilt that a death in the family brings - naturally - but the other half was coping.

So much of what I observe in the world is so contrary to these words (especially together!) that I was intrigued and simply had to see what Wilder had to say.<br />I was not disappointed.<br />The book is not very long, so I wasn't sure at first, especially when the first 41 pages were basically all introduction, including a Brief History of Money.<br />All was interesting AND I wondered... &quot;Where's the beef?&quot;<br />The last sentence of the &quot;Brief History&quot; hit the nail on the head with these words: &quot;The trick is to reunite money with its spiritual roots.  To make money love.&quot;<br />The rest of the book does exactly that: teaches, informs and inspires the reader exactly how to interact with money as love and then live that experience out in the world so as to reunite everyone with that experience.<br />The informed, inspired reader could take that message and literally become a &quot;Money is Love&quot; evangelist.<br />Try it out: do the exercises and see for yourself.

The main point I took away from this simple and quirky volume is to teach that our spiritual practices are not to be about being cumbersome or difficult, instead they are to be about openness to beauty and power, a practice of what feels good, what feels right.<br />It reminds me that anything can be sacred and spiritual, from reading about the process of flossing your teeth to the things we say to ourselves or that others say to us to anything at all.<br />And even in its bare-bones simplicity, it makes you think.	2004-02-15

I avoided buying this book for weeks, yet I could hear its title reverberating in my ears.  &quot;Woe is I!&quot; and &quot;Woe is I?!&quot; and &quot;Woe! Is I.&quot;<br />I finally answered the call and bought it.<br />Reading &quot;Woe is I&quot; is like having your own entertaining grammar teacher sitting alongside you as you proof-read your work.  Yes, entertaining grammar teacher! You read correctly.<br />(See the chapter on &quot;Saying is Believing -- How to Write What You Mean.&quot;)<br />I am a writer who has been known to commit grammatical goofs from time to time.  O'Conner's guide to grammar is user friendly, amusing, and makes the subject memorable.<br />It includes a useful glossary and index so that the reader can easily find a solution to his or her grammatical query.  I also appreciate the examples O'Conner uses to show incorrect errors and their correction.  It is helpful to see the problem &quot;in action&quot; and then see the way she would solve it.<br />O'Conner clucks over the mistakes writers frequently make... though she does so quite gently.<br />The chapter on &quot;Verbal Abuse&quot; is both hilarious and thought evoking.<br />This book is a pleasant companion to Strunk and White's Element's of Style.  It does the job with humor -- and many more words than the classic-slim volume of all-you-need-to-know about basic writing.<br />Enjoy this one. If the title calls out to you like it did to me, it must mean you are supposed to read it!	2004-02-12

My copy of &quot;The Artist's Way&quot; is tattered and written in so much I would probably do well to get another copy.<br />It has been life changing for me -- and yet her tone tends to annoy me in this earlier work of hers.<br />In comes &quot;Walking in this World&quot; -- much calmer writing with same approach -- a 12 week writing/life discovery course.<br />Many people I knew had challenges with staying the course over the entire 12 weeks which brings us to this new book which does not have a week-by-week approach, instead it reminds me more of a Natalie Goldberg approach: short, easy to digest chapters followed by an application step or a &quot;try this&quot; where the reader gets to DO SOMETHING from the lessons of the chapter.<br />I remember when I was younger I used to go to James Taylor concerts every summer.  I always knew I would get a quality show and as I aged along with JT, it just got better.<br />Same thing is true here: Julia Cameron is more human, more true, more approachable and more - dare I say it - loveable? than she has been in the past.<br />It is difficult to express what a treasure this book is to me already, even in the week or so I have owned it.<br />I know I will go back to it repeatedly and it will become probably even more worn and jaded than The Artist's Way.  I have already been recommending it to every Julia Cameron fan I know and I would like to run and hug and kiss my friend who recommended it to me!<br />What I love is that for people who could not see themselves committing to 12 weeks of work can easily commit to choosing a chapter (one of my friends just opens the book and reads wherever it opens!) and spending three minutes with the chapter itself and then, when inspired, do the additional work Cameron offers.<br />I can't say it enough.  You'll just have to buy this book and see for yourself.	2004-02-11

Each page has quite a bit of text and I thought, \\"This is way too much on a page to teach the very littlest children who really need the lessons the most\\" and then I saw the bolded, larger words on each page could be the only words read.  Those words would be enough for the littlest ones to understand the message of the book.<br />It would be tough to write a perfect book on this subject that pleases everyone.<br />This book makes a sincere effort and will be helpful for many who read it.	2004-02-07

I am always looking for recommendations of those movies I truly do not want to miss, especially when I am renting and overwhelmed by the vast array of movies on the shelves at my local rental outlet.<br />This unique title is chock full of suggestions so that I can look at movies to fit my mood and inspire me accordingly.<br />They list &quot;Antianxiety&quot; movies (I was thrilled to see quotes from Adaptation: Charlie Kaufman as played by Nicholas Cage: an excellent movie!; movies about finding that significant love in your life, movies to inspire your meaning in life.... and much more.<br />Sidebars from the authors help us get to know each of them better and the quotes from movies are priceless.<br />They also have a unique section called &quot;Junk Food for the Soul&quot; which gives warning for movies which are wayyyyy to fluffy without much substance... and recognizing sometimes those very same movies taste so good, they are worthy of the investment of time.<br />Some new movies I had not considered before reading this book are &quot;School Ties&quot; (an early Brandon Fraser, Matt Damon film) and &quot;The Misfits&quot; a 1960 classic.<br />In fact, the only weakness I really saw was in the selection of movies.  There were a lot of really current movies -- and I know there are lots of wonderful &quot;oldies and goodies&quot; although these may be less available for rental at our local rental stores.<br />I also saw from reading the back of the book that these authors have a slew of other movie titles. I am guessing they are all worth scanning.	2004-02-07

As I read this book I felt like I was along on Tama Kieve's journey.  Her book is like a &quot;permission slip&quot; which allows the ability to get off the crowded, usual path and onto the extraordinary path... the different, less traveled way AND the way back to our true selves.<br />Especially heart warming is the truthfulness of the writing.<br />Just because Kieves is a &quot;Harvard Lawyer&quot; doesn't mean this whole process was a piece of cake... not at all! Her doubts, her fears, her wonderings, musings and continuings are similar to the ones I have felt as I have traveled my &quot;unconventional path.&quot;<br />As you seek your perfectly unique, beautiful -- and perhaps unconventional path -- you will, like me, laugh in recognition and delight to hear of the first Creative Writing class where Tama writes in amazement, &quot;She had plumbing and plumbing problems!  Then she yawned, revealing silver fillings.  As if all that weren't enough, I happened to notice that a part of her hem hung longer than the rest of her denim, made-in- America, made-on-my-planet, skirt.&quot; followed by her HUGE a-ha &quot;This writing guru was an ordinary woman!&quot;<br />This book is wise, hilarious, inspiring, thought evoking and much much more than can be put into words.<br />Kieves chooses her words with artful thought. She literally seems to have lodged herself in my thoughts regularly. I know it is a book I will return to repeatedly.<br />Read this one now. You won't be disappointed.	2004-02-04

Because there were five different women involved, I didn't feel very deeply involved with any of them.<br />Two I liked and two annoyed the heck out of me for the most part.... and the fifth? She was ok... I think? I really didn't get to know her very well.<br />I also wished there was a straight, normal man we could all appreciate.<br />I captured several really good lines from Jaffe, but that was not worth the more than 400 page read.

One sentence he wrote about you using his process said, &quot;Either way, I'm here for you for the long haul&quot; just cracked me up!<br />Simply stated in Carson's word, &quot;Your Gremlin is the narrator in your head that diverts you from finding simple pleasures inside.&quot;  He also reminded me how my own Gremlin hypnotizes me to what is really true.<br />The process is presented at its simplest and includes excercises to deepen the readers experience.<br />All of this is very valuable AND I would recommend this book AND I think there is something missing because I hardly see my life as having ONE Gremlin... perhaps it is a HEAD Gremlin... to me the Narrator Gremlin wears different costumes.<br />Nonetheless, overall both the book and the process will have incredible value for you, especially if you take action and integrate what you learn AND take it even deeper as it works in your life.	2004-01-22

I have only read this book once... and it gives me the impression that I will probably increase my assessment (and rating) over time as I integrate Laura Day's message and wisdom into my daily practice.<br />Her writing style is almost angelic -- I don't want to say fluffy because that sounds as if I don't value her message -- I truly do... AND I also want to recognize it may take time for some readers to have that light go on.. that Shift that one reviewer noted... to happen.<br />Perhaps two readings through, journaling continuing (as she suggests) and continuing to being open to the Circle and the Gifts in each element.<br />This is probably my favorite feature of the book.<br />Day approaches Conscious Creation from making a &quot;Wish&quot; and she suggests creating &quot;Reality Tales&quot; (a la the old 'Fairy Tales').  She suggests the reader keep a Circle Journal as the initial wish manifests... and the stages... each stage, she says, includes a gift.... which is very aligned with my thinking and belief as well.<br />I strongly encourage anyone who is intrigued by this book to get a copy and begin the process and watch what unfolds. And then read it again, continue the process and watch what unfolds.  And do it again.  And Again. And Again.	2004-01-22

All this time I just thought I was different than most people I met!!<br />I found this book comforting, hilarious, mind opening and connecting.<br />The biographies of other quirkyalones and the chapter on quirkytogethers was especially excellent, since being a quirkyalone does not mean you are a recluse, its more like you are comfortable with solitude AND enjoy company.<br />No wonder I never fared well on the Myers-Briggs when it came to &quot;Am I Extroverted or Introverted?&quot; I am quirkyalone! I love parties and people AND I need to be alone, too.<br />Ironically, I found this book in the &quot;Relationships&quot; section of the bookstore, which gave me a good laugh.<br />Read this book and give it as a gift to anyone you know who fits the profile.

I wanted to stand up and applaud when I read that section.<br />My only real criticism is the title, which should let the reader know this is about ROMANTIC abandonment... and can be applied to other areas.  It really zeros in, for the most part, on the romantic side.	2004-01-22

This title uses flaps, envelopes and pop ups imaginatively to engage the reader in its Fairy Adventures.<br />One slight criticism is the fanciful writing is more difficult for little ones to read on their own.... but we read it together through once and then she was able to read it herself.<br />I especially liked showing her the \\"writing backwards in the mirror\\" trick (she had never seen that before)as illustrated in the \\"Fairy Secret Code\\".<br />The book also has a puffy, padded feel to it, making the process of holding it in your hands different than most other books which also sets it apart from the others on your shelf.<br />I also suggest people purchase a copy from a place like Amazon where other hands have not looked through it.  We bought our copy at a local bookstore so the treasured tiara had been taken out: we didn't notice until we got home and had read it and opened flaps, etc, too late to return.	2004-01-20

I am not a big reader of Mary Higgins Clark: I have only tried out three or four of her page turners. Nonetheless, discovering her life through this memoir was quite fascinating.<br />Tidbits that surprised me (and at the same time, brought me to<br />say &quot;Oh, ofcourse!) include the many tragedies that make up her<br />life. Even as I call them &quot;tragedies&quot; I can almost feel her disagree.<br />Her spirit seemed to recognize and acknowledge the less-than-idyllic factors which make up the tapestry of her life AND at the same time, she didn't ever allow those to stop her.... she had a life to live, after all, as we all do.<br />My favorite &quot;fact tidbit&quot; was to read about Mary Higgins Clark's original writing jobs as well as her original writing group. It really reinforces how important it can be for ALL writers to participate in critique and writing groups with other writers.<br />She has one particular career in writing that made me say &quot;OH!<br />So thats how she honed the craft of 'page turning writer' compelling the reader to find out more&quot;. I don't want to give it away, though..... instead I invite you to experience the book yourself.	2004-01-20

Its more of the &quot;Name it and claim it&quot; approach which works very well.... when the claiming involves taking congruent action, about which Nemeth also offers instruction.<br />Its an all around powerful read, one which I repeat and refer to frequently both for my own learning and for my life coaching clients as well since this is oftentimes a challenging area.<br />If you read it and put the information to use, you will definitely have a positive return on your investment.	2004-01-15

I think I was the last person in the United States to become aware of Henry Ford's anti-semitism.<br />I make it a practice to study one person a month and I decided as a business builder, Henry Ford was worthy of my attention and study.<br />I found this particular biography and thought, &quot;OK, this has a completely different approach, let's try it on.&quot;<br />I found Baldwin's passion and zealousness for his topic and his particular slant to be very powerful.  As is frequent in such writing, it also became a barrier because every action Ford took became, through Baldwin's eyes, a matter of Ford being the Personification of Evil.<br />I am not condoning Ford's thoughts, beliefs or behaviors.  I am believing that not every action he took was a result of some undercurrent of Anti Semitism.<br />That said, this book is worth a read due to the level of research Baldwin has done both in this biography and the biography of one of Ford's friends and role models (and less rabidly Anti-Semitic although there was some there) in Thomas Alva Edison.<br />I just had this thought: I wonder how many business leaders remain staunchly racist... yet it has gone deeply underground in this age.<br />I wonder how many business (and political leaders) continue to harbor less than transformed thought?<br />Something to think about... and continue to stand against.	2004-01-15

This book  does not disappoint.<br />I am a bit perplexed by some of these other reviews: could they have possibly read the same book I have next to me, highlighted - read and re-read, scribbled inside due to the many insights contained within?<br />I found the chapters on \\"Running and Writing\\" and \\"Failure\\" to be exceptionally intriguing.  The \\"Running and Writing\\" chapter reminds me of Natalie Goldberg's love affair with the same topic in her work \\"Wild Mind\\".  I can completely connect viscerally to Oates' statement, \\"Running seems to allow me, ideally, an expanded consciousness.\\"<br />\\"Failure\\" reminded me that \\"the greats\\" too, have had their own versions of unsuccess... and some people, such as Alice James the sister-in-the-shadows of William and Henry James may have appeared in life to be the personification of \\"Failure\\" in her (found after death) words immortal.<br />Stories such as these, told in the voice of a \\"JCO\\" (yes, she refers to her writer self using her initials in the book) are quite enlightening and reassuring to me.<br />I will treasure this book.

I was looking for a quick read over the Christmas Holiday weekend and happened across this title by the author whose name I recognized from \\"The Christmas Box\\".  I had read that title years ago, shortly after the death of my daughter and never even saw it as a romance, I saw it as a getting-over-grief-story, so I was intrigued to see how Evans \\"wrote romance.\\"<br />The opening of the book confused me briefly (annoyed me?) though once I got passed it I easily remembered the formula of romance novels and could fairly easily see where this one was going.<br />Notably enjoyable in the journey was the discussion of art, Italy and Eliana's painting of Ross' portrait.  I was very curious about \\"The Big Secret of Ross\\" but again, that just got on my nerves as a part of the formulaic aspect of the romance.  It would not dissuade me from reading: in fact, there was gold here which makes me recommend the book to folks looking for some quality entertainment in this genre.<br />One of the most interesting aspects of the book was following along on Ross' tours at the museum where he is an \\"under the table\\" tour guide.<br />Question: Why didn't Eliana maintain her Italian name in the U.S?<br />I most likely won't get an answer.... Though I simply HAD to ask it!<br />Final note, if you haven't read \\"The Christmas Box\\" I highly recommend it.

I found sections 4 and 5 to be crescendo-esque, filled with a-ha moments and ideas for me to take into my poetry (and other) writing practice.<br />Earlier reviews concur that this title is reminiscent of Natalie Goldberg and Anne Lamott: in my estimation, these are really great indications of a solid, enjoyable, applications oriented read.  I was not disappointed.<br />My only disappointment in regards to this book is that I have not been able to find anything else by the same author..... hopefully this will change!	2003-12-27

Emma had one more book to read for her monthly reading award so we plunked down and started reading.<br />This board book is deceptive... it is written for a child: starting as a small baby and up to a teen and yet it can also be very much for the adult reading to the small baby up to the teen.<br />It describes how the parent loves the child and how God loves the child, asking the child to accept and know the answer to the question of whether or not they are loved \\"Just in Case You Ever Wonder\\"... and who doesn't wonder, \\"Does my family love me?\\"  or \\"Does God love me?\\" or \\"What is there about me to love?\\"<br />Lucado lays it out beautifully for the child in each of us to know and treasure.<br />You will want to have a copy of this one around \\"just in case\\" a child wanders by who you might have the chance to sit and read for a while.  You could even sit out on your front steps and wait for your neighbors to come out and offer to read to them for a spell.<br />I read it to Emma who then read it to two-year-old Sam and then to herself again and then to Sam again and then to herself again.<br />She started the day cranky and ended up going to school with a big smile on her face.<br />See what I mean about this book?<br />Read it to all the \\"children\\" of every age you can.  It will be good for YOUR soul as well as theirs.	2003-12-01

I have read &quot;Traveling Mercies&quot; and &quot;Bird by Bird&quot; and was really excited to spend my Thanksgiving Weekend with family AND this new novel.<br />I found myself laughing out loud in some places and I ALMOST want to give away the funniest line in the whole book... but lets just say this: its when Angela and Mattie are discussing Mattie wanting to (jokingly) end her life.  Angela's line is brilliant: I may borrow it someday.  Who knows, perhaps tomorrow!<br />I also admired Lamott's usage of metaphor... it added her signature flavor as the story unfolded.  She also frequently labeled people as &quot;beautiful&quot; or &quot;stunning&quot; and then described them microscopically. Putting together the pieces I thought, &quot;That is what YOU see as beautiful?!&quot;  (Pauline as an example.) Very thought evoking.... sneakily thought evoking!<br />On the weaker side, I found myself longing for more depth: didn't really know much of Mattie beyond the surface.  Perhaps that is Lamott's intention: for the reader to create more of the character ourselves?  Given that the book covers more than 4 years of Mattie's life, I can understand that individual characterizations may lose something if the author doesn't want to write an encyclopedia-length book.... nonetheless, I longed for more insight into Mattie's responses to all the events which took place.  There was some picture painting and I would have appreciated one or two sentences more in these snapshots.  It could have made all the difference in the world.<br />I was curious about Abby... and then decided, &quot;Its Mattie's book, not Abby's book&quot; and then I realized there was no particular feeling of closeness with Mattie either, for that matter.<br />In one respect, this book is sort of like watching a few seasons of television's &quot;thirtysomething&quot; with a more eclectic, weathered by life California cast.  I enjoyed &quot;thirtysomething&quot; so I consider that a positive thing.<br />If the thought of that makes your skin crawl... then don't start with this one.... check out &quot;Bird by Bird&quot; also by Lamott to get a taste of her style which I found to be consistent in this novel.<br />I find it especially appealing that the main character in this book is a Christian woman who &quot;normal&quot;.... meaning flawed, angry and out of control at times, lustful with a menagerie of friends and a truck load of skeletons in her closet and in her surrounding closets.<br />A refreshing way to retreat from my own family skeletons in order to get to know Ms. Lamott's characters.consider that a positive thing.<br />If the thought of that makes your skin crawl... then don't start with this one.... check out &quot;Bird by Bird&quot; also by Lamott to get a taste of her style which I found to be consistent in this novel.<br />I find it especially appealing that the main character in this book is a Christian woman who &quot;normal&quot;.... meaning flawed, angry and out of control at times, lustful with a menagerie of friends and a truck load of skeletons in her closet and in her surrounding closets.<br />A refreshing way to retreat from my own family skeletons in order to get to know Ms. Lamott's characters.	2003-11-30

Makes me wonder what books are being written THIS YEAR that my six year old daughters daughter, at 41 will say, \\"Wow, this voice is from 1938? And she is so present to today!\\"<br />As a writer and a teacher of writing myself, I have spoken words similar to these crafted by Ueland: \\"No writing is a waste of time-- no creative work where the feelings, the imagination, the intelligence must work.  With every sentence you write, you have learned something. It has done you good.  It has stretched your understanding.\\"<br />While the book is written in a sometimes rambly form that makes my left brained side shout \\"What was the editor thinking when s/he organized this darn thing?!\\" at the same time I think this exact feature is one which teaches by example as well.  Rambly, unorganized, out of order, pieces dropped and not necessarily re-picked up... its ok.  Its life.  Its ok.  As I just quoted \\"It has stretched your understanding.\\"<br />My copy is heavily underlined and dog eared... even though it is less than a year old I have gone back to favored sections repeatedly.<br />Read this one and you will have a brand new \\" haven't we met somewhere before?\\" friend on your bookshelf to enjoy for a long, long time.	2003-11-30

I loved discovering favorites of mine such as on the Anne Sullivan/Helen Keller picture my six year old delightedly intoned: Its the teacher!! referring to the play The Miracle Worker we saw several months ago).<br />There are also lesser known forerunners: Mary Katherine Goddard, first woman publisher in America in the 18th Century, Elizabeth Blackwell, the 1st Woman to earn a medical degree.<br />Another story about the books namesake: A is for Abigail: we read about the impact Abigail Adams had upon the political process within the context of her time.  How she participated in the US Revolutionary war in a different way than the men AND it was significant as well.  We also learned how her vast letter writing to her husband, future president John Adams, effected our history, especially in her words, I desire that you should remember the ladies.<br />Excellent for girls and boys alike, this is one that can be visited again, and again, and again.	2003-11-16

Each reviewer has taken away a special - and different - nugget from the book.<br />Here is what especially intrigued me:<br />Hog compared the \\"raves and applause\\" that Feathers received<br />to what he received.... nothing.  He craved what Feathers received.<br />He judged himself unfavorably and risked his life to<br />have the applause, like Feathers.<br />Feathers didn't care about the applause.  He was just doing what<br />he loved to do, which included being an excellent friend of<br />Hog.<br />The most inspiring moment for them came when they flew out<br />of the \\"applause range\\" and could simply enjoy flying and being<br />together.<br />It would be fascinating to read this as a family or a group of friends and see what they people walk away with... my guess is that each would walk away with something inspiring, something different, and some significant unique message especially for them.<br />Read it to hear your significant message.	2003-11-16

How much stuff is packed in here?  I wondered.<br />The excellent features of this book include the \\"In Your Notebook\\" sections where you can try out the techniques and strategies Mayes has just explained.  I also really enjoy the variety of poets  whose works are introduced.<br />However, there are some moments where there is so much detail that I found myself losing interest and not retaining as much.  In that respect, it really showed Mayes background with a university-type audience.<br />It is definitely worth it to have on any aspiring poet's shelf. I can see myself using this as a reference and as an inspiration for years to come.	2003-11-15

It may not be 100% new material.  What it does do is package its message in a way that is workable, applicable, engaging and enjoyable to read.<br />I found myself mildly annoyed in certain paragraphs though it certainly was not enough for me to set aside all the goodness just because of that.<br />It would be like turning down some double chocolate fudge because I didn't like the serving dish.

It is a guidebook for the spiritual person to integrate methods from many different traditions and beliefs into their spiritual development.<br />Several aspects of this book that really makes it especially rich include the large variety of cross cultural practices including activities and ritual which you might not have necessarily thought of before as &quot;prayer&quot;.<br />Oman Shannon reminds the reader that prayer practice is best moved beyond the realm of our &quot;juice draining&quot; early religious training and into the world of sacred intention so that we can truly encounter the divine.<br />Each chapter outlines another prayer practice and includes a feature called &quot;Suggestions for beginning the exploration.&quot;  This tool is especially helpful as it continues the integration process.... I mean learning about these practices is interesting AND actually using them takes them to the next level.<br />I found the sections on &quot;Chants&quot;, &quot;Milagros&quot;, &quot;Mastermind Groups&quot; and &quot;Forgiveness Practices&quot; to be among the most beneficial... although I am sure as different scenarios appear in my life, different chapters will be applied and utilized.	2003-10-20

Its length makes it encyclopedic.  Having a challenge? Turn to the corresponding chapter.<br />I recommend reading it through once and then going back to the chapters that speak especially to you and using those techniques first.... You will reap much gold along the way, guaranteed.	2003-07-20

Studying Martha Graham's life is an awakening experience.  Reading Graham's memoir \\"Blood Memory\\" simultaneously provides a beautiful counterpoint, knowing the subject will not observe herself in the same way as her biographer.<br />I dance away from this book with a definite appreciation for Graham's brilliance in creativity and willingness to navigate the many rough patches she encountered AND give such a gift to humanity at the same time.<br />The numbers of influential people she touched is amazing and enlightening.<br />I suggest this book for any creative thinker: there are applications for all of us.	2003-07-20

Hogg and Blau use a very workable, applicable style to deal with parenting a toddler: as I am on my fourth toddler, I can attest that the techniques are valuable and easily used in parenting.<br />I especially appreciate the step by step approach and belief in \\"conscious\\" parenting instead of parenting-by-the-numbers.  The suggestions and notes from \\"real\\" people via email interspersed further give the book a personalized, realistic flavor.<br />The ending chapters about having another baby and valuing relationships are very much a part of parenting the toddler.  My only wish is there was a touch more in regards to collaborative-parenting  with both parents being consistent Baby Whisperers.	2003-07-20

My heart literally beats with more lightness and vibrance as I read this enlightening book.<br />A student of \\"Oneness\\" between spiritual traditions, I was delighted to read this new offering.  Maggie Oman Shannon introduces scripture selections with artful prose which mirrors and calls forth the scripture and principals in question.<br />I can see myself suggesting this book to many people who have yet to realize our many \\"likenesses\\" between the descendents of Abraham.<br />In fact, the book reminds me that we are ALL unified... whether our beliefs come from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam or any other faith.  Our hearts connect us just as this book connected me so surely with its message.	2003-07-20

I was curious about the \\"supportive cast\\" as well.  What would happen to them all, post Greek holiday?<br />I was mildly annoyed to find the next section had my least favorite character as its protagonist.  Because Ms. Glass writes with such beauty, I continued on in spite of the initial distaste.<br />What I found was as I read further, I actually found myself caring deeply about these people.  I had a startling \\"a-ha\\" moment when I realized what happened for me in relationship to my feelings about Fenno paralleled the feelings Fenno had for his relatives and friends.  As he turned his corner, I sighed remembering my own turned corner... and it became richer also as the result of his corner.<br />Intriguing and compelling.<br />There are also some beautiful tidbits along the way, turns of the pencil such as \\"proud pilot of an improvised life\\" and \\"I hate it when people talk about twists of fate\\", Anna liked to say.  \\"When it comes to life, we spin our own yarn, and where we end up is really, in fact, where we always intended to be.\\"<br />The integration of characters crossing into each other's lives is another subtle nuance.  I was reminded of Miles Drentell (character from \\"thirtysomething\\") remarking \\"People are like magnets.\\"<br />I wonder if Ms. Glass was a fan of that show?	2003-07-20

Beautifully illustrated and thought evoking story which allows young readers (and their parents/teachers/siblings) to see what an impact different choices make in lives both factual and fictional.<br />Milo and his mice friends on their very special island find a mysterious stone and then need to decide what next step to take.  Pfister gives a choice for the reader: happy ending or sad ending.  Very clever and both endings should be read so that children can understand how choices build upon choices both in writing, creativity and in real life.<br />Great book for adults as well and Grandparents may want to keep a copy on hand for when their grand children come visit.	2003-06-29

I picked it up at a used book sale solely based upon the fact it was a past selection from Oprah's Book Club.<br />The characters were so weakly painted and shallowly portrayed the only ones I was more than vaguely interested in were Jack's children, Jack and Kathryn's daughter and Kathryn's grandmother.  In fact, I found it amusing that one of the readers on this page referred to Kathryn as a stay-at-home wife when she was a music teacher at the local high school... her job is mentioned several times throughout the book.... Though the way the book reads I am not surprised he didn't pick up on it!<br />The story was predictable except for a couple surprises which were so jarring they annoyed me more than anything else.  From the first chapter I could have fast forwarded to the end with amazing accuracy.  I did read it quickly, mostly because I wanted to get to the end AND there was no intriguing, interesting or poetic writing or character development to get in the pathway of my journey through the 291 pages.<br />The only reason the book gets 2 stars from me is because it did compel me to keep reading.... If only to confirm my prophetic view of the story.....which I managed quite efficiently.	2003-06-29

On the front on back covers I have written many of the exceptionally thought provoking word art sections which include:<br />A description of a summer desert heat on page 165:<br />\\"Full on summer fell like a hammer\\"<br />And words describing teen aged Astrid's painting  on page 379:<br />\\"streaks that became Blakean figures at sunrise.\\"<br />There are many, many more and if you are a writer or anyone who loves words, I could recommend the book based on that aspect of it alone.<br />The story emphasizes survival amidst an overwhelmingly despicable backdrop while managing not to not make the daughter, Astrid, into a said and the mother, Ingrid look like demon spawn at best.<br />Instead both women are human, both flawed and also both filled with divine inspiration at times throughout the book.  Both seek love and unconditional acceptance from the other.  I found the ending highly satisfying, which I was not sure would happen considering some parts of the book which were so disturbing my stomach would get upset!	2003-06-29

Maisel's book is a year long study and integrated plan to both practice and experience &quot;creativity as a religion&quot;.  The suggested plan is to work through the book sequentially... which is an EXCELLENT intention I hope readers take on.  And at the same time, I am reading bits and pieces and chunks and applying not step by step but instead following syncronicity in my life.<br />My theory and observation is that either will neet positive results.<br />The bite sized chunks with the very human voice of the author, once again a book by Eric Maisel hits the target both artistically and effectively.	2003-06-27

Be Impeccable with Your Word<br />2. Don't Take Anything Personally<br />3. Don't Make Assumptions<br />4. Always Do Your Best<br />My favorite quote from the book, to sort of give you a flavor for the writing is this: \\"Just to breathe is enough for us to always be happy, to enjoy life.\\"<br />Implementing the Four Agreements is when you will realize it is NOT as simple as it seems.<br />An excellent, thought provoking book which you can take as deeply as you desire.  It WILL change your life if you are willing to stick to the Agreements.	2003-06-20

I don't have anything AGAINST Dr. Phil, I just hoped it wouldn't<br />have a lot of really good food for thought, practical applications and wisdom in the straight, no nonsense approach that makes up Oprah's buddy, Dr. Phil.<br />Well, I couldn't help myself: this book is chock full of good stuff.<br />Not only that, Dr. Phil's voice rings through his writing so clearly that I can literally hear him talking to me as I read!<br />The approach in the book is very much a step-by-step approach working with a foundation of gathering evidence from defining moments in your life and then creating a plan of action through taking action upon positive, empowering choices instead of being \\"stuck\\" in the quagmire of your negative life history.<br />Dr. Phil reminds us to \\"Know your history so you can walk out of it.\\"<br />He tells on himself more than once, describing his own episodes of \\"creative stupidity\\" which had me howling with laughter.<br />Another lightbulb moment for me and a pure \\"Dr. Philism\\" was the<br />reality that we are, in every moment, contributing or contaminating our relationships. Wow. That alone is worth the purchase of the book: especially in reading the supportive paragraphs.<br />Like I said earlier, I didn't WANT to like this book. The main problem there is too much tangible substance that I can use to apply to my life in a positive way that I can't help myself in giving it a high rating.	2003-06-17

This entertaining book with humorous and compelling illustrations by Jared Lee takes us on a tour of one little boy's thinking and wildly outlandish imagination process as he is getting prepared for his new gym teacher on the first day of school.<br />Everything becomes larger than life.... just like when children and adults are fearful and the fear turns into worry in anticipation of that \\"thing\\" you fear. Included examples of who the new teacher reportedly resembles are \\"Coach Kong\\" and a wielder of Crazy Glue during a game of Tag.<br />My daughter and I had great discussions about the literal thinking: Cart Wheels.... you see a cart with wheels which the children are supporting, headstands are children balancing on their heads, and a baseball game played with real (as in black things flying through the air with fangs shining and ready to bite.... Not frighteningly for the reader though our protagonist has the ever familiar deer in the headlights look.<br />The best is the ending: a reminder that most worry is ill placed after all....as our friend enters the gymnasium to a much different reality than the one he had colorfully imagined.<br />You can read this book \\"just for fun\\" or deepen the experience by engaging your child in conversation about the negative impact of  worry, adding meaning that isn't there and how getting real is what is always the most empowering.	2003-06-14

This book is  a treasure trove of ideas, inspiration and many many reasons<br />to remember and ACT on &quot;Putting Your Heart&quot; on paper.<br />Klauser is an extremely engaging writer. I found myself smiling in<br />response to what I thought were personal inside jokes like a lyric<br />from &quot;Sound of Silence&quot; being weaved into a paragraph about the<br />impact of the vocalization of a baby upon a group of tired, unengaged<br />adults.<br />This is a book I find myself continuing to return to over time.  I don't<br />think I ever read through it front to back.  Instead, I go to the Table<br />of Contents to find what calls to my spirit and then I usually find<br />myself reading a couple chapters before and after that chapter.<br />I can't imagine any reader coming away with less than 49 ideas to<br />try out and implement, much beyond what Klauser calls &quot;Now You&quot;<br />when she specifically asks you to apply what is in the chapter.<br />Read this book, treasure this book.

I am not a big reader of Mary Higgins Clark: I have only<br />tried out three or four of her page turners.  Nonetheless, discovering<br />her life through this memoir was quite fascinating.<br />Tidbits that surprised me (and at the same time, brought me to<br />say &quot;Oh, ofcourse!) include the many tragedies that make up her<br />life.  Even as I call them &quot;tragedies&quot; I can almost feel her disagree.<br />Her spirit seemed to recognize and acknowledge the less-than-idyllic<br />factors which make up the tapestry of her life AND at the same<br />time, she didn't ever allow those to stop her.... she had a life to live,<br />after all, as we all do.<br />My favorite &quot;fact tidbit&quot; was to read about Mary Higgins Clark's<br />original writing jobs as well as her original writing group.  It<br />really reinforces how important it can be for ALL writers to<br />participate in critique and writing groups with other writers.<br />She has one particular career in writing that made me say &quot;OH!<br />So thats how she honed the craft of 'page turning writer' compelling<br />the reader to find out more&quot;.  I don't want to give it away, though..... instead<br />I invite you to experience the book  yourself.	2003-06-08

There are some books I read once and then turn right around and read through again.<br />\\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" is one of those books.<br />Sue Monk Kidd writes with beauty, texture and with a voice the reader can climb into and receive a good sized dose of care and comfort.  With messages on several different levels, the reader is treated to an excellent story, pages filled with characters you get to know and care about personally and deeper meaning within all of it which does not clunk the reader over the head like a frying pan: it sort of simmers and boils as the story unfolds.<br />I fell in love with Lily Owens, the 14 year old protagonist in this story of South Carolina in the 60's.  I found myself wishing I had been as strong as she was at her young age and at the same time, from her story being grateful for my story as I recognized the beauty of the fabric that all our lives are woven into as one.<br />As a mother of an eleven-year-old daughter who is just starting to read \\"adult books\\", I can't wait for her schedule to be cleared enough so that she can really dig into this book so we can talk about it together: in fact, I am thinking it would be a great summer Mother-Daughter book club read.<br />See how inspiring \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\"  is?
