Until I found this book, I had no idea to what great and amazing extent crickets are revered, bred and cared for as pets in Asia. Some are raised for their \\"musicianship\\", others for their fighting skills, employed in to-the-death matches like fighting cocks and fighting dogs. Then there is the amazing amount of cricket paraphernalia, both antique and modern that is on display here in the many photos that accompany the text.  <br /> <br />This book reprints in their near entirety, two nearly century old, classic books about crickets, adding modern photographs and other information. This is not dry \\"insect science\\",  this book is about the culture (or perhaps \\"cult\\"!) of the cricket as practiced in Asian countries, where as much care and feeding and love is applied to these insects as Americans devote to their dogs and cats. <br /> <br /> Did you have any idea that cricket owners can diagnose various illnesses of their crickets and nurse them to health with the help of special diets? It's true, and you can read about it here, along with many other fascinating details. Did you know that some cricket owners apply wax to their cricket's wings to sweeten the sound of their song? Read all about it here.  <br /> <br /> If I didn't know for sure this book is factual, I could believe it was some satirical Monty Python-esque send-up of extreme pet owners. But these are facts and if more people would read this book, I would not be at all surprised if the culture of crickets as pets would spread significantly within the United States.  <br /> <br />	2005-07-03

It seems that Mr. Randi concludes that anything and everything he doesn't understand or have proof of is a fraud or hoax. One example: acupuncture.  Never mind that thousands,  if not millions of people have been helped and healed by acupuncture, but even the American Medical Association has concluded that it is a legitimate medical therapy. But Randi includes it in his list of frauds and hoaxes.<br /><br />There are many other examples where Randi errs and misleads, or simply does not understand and chooses to cast aspersions (p on) what he is woefully ignorant about. In some cases he cites individuals who have supposedly exposed frauds or disproven claims and theories, but the reader is left with little or no details to assess the claims of the \\"fraud buster.\\"<br /><br />In other cases, a supernatural feat is presumed to have been disproven simply because someone else has managed to appear to replicate the supernatural feat by using sleight-of-hand or other trickery.<br /><br /> Not everything that is real and true can or needs to be proven by science or  proven to Mr. Randi. (A large portion of the history of science, in fact, is a history of proving that what science once concluded was unreal or unprovable is in fact real.)  If you accept on face value  everything that Mr. Randi wants you to accept, your life will be much poorer for it.<br /><br />This book will provide great reassurance for people who don't want to believe in anything other than their egos. As stated above, this book is a great example of where skepticism has fallen victim to cynicism and that makes this book more harmful than helpful.  To a great extent,  I am very surprised and sorry to conclude, this book itself is a fraud.rmful than helpful.

It promotes culling the best most healthy and vigorous animals and thus ultimately leads to absolutely unnecessary degradation of wildlife. This book epitomizes the very worst and shameful aspects of hunting: Trophy hunting!<br /><br /> Look to this book for great examples of North America's most magnificent animals slaughtered for sport and the names of the people who did the slaughtering.<br /><br />This book is a tremendous record of the insensitivity of man and calousness toward life. Just imagine the scene in the wild, as a hunter and companions come across a deer in the wild: \\"Wow, that is the most beautiful buck I have ever seen! Look at the rack on it--probably the largest in North America. Simply magnificent! I am going to snuff it's life out right now and claim it as a trophy and a book will brag about my accomplishment!\\"<br /><br />The irony inherent throughout this book is staggering. The record of needless slaughter is appalling.<br /><br />If sport  hunting is to continue, wouldn't it make more sense to harvest the weakest and most decrepid animals, rather than promote slaughtering the the most healthy and magnificent creatures of each species?<br /><br />I am certain that in the fullness of time, nearly every hunter listed in this book and celebrated for his record kills, will regret and be ashamed of the actions recorded here.<br /><br />But as much as those of us who love animals and respect life may be inclined to hate these misguided hunters whose names are shamelessly recorded in these pages, we  should somehow have compassion for them and their misguided ways, the kind of compassion we hope that in this life or another, they might show toward the beautiful animals God has graced us with in this world.	2005-06-12

The author takes the reader through the history of the process and shows how it developed through all its many forms and styles, from ancient to modern, to the time of original publication in the early 1970s. <br /> <br />Noteworthy and groundbreaking artists in the field are properly noted and discussed. <br /> <br />While not specifically a how-to book, the basics of the craft are addressed in a thoughtful, knowledgeable way. The illustrations, both black and white and full color are excellent, numerous and varied in style and era. Includes a glossary, bibliography and timeline.  <br /> <br />The text is not overlong or ponderous--in fact, it's a quick read--yet a tremendous amount of worthwhile information is conveyed. I'd say anyone with a serious interest in the fine art and craft of wood engraving and wood cuts would consider this book a fine treat, and very likely a must-have.  It's a very good book.	2005-05-19

But be aware, despite the title, these volumes cover primarily American painters, not artists who specialized in other media. <br /> <br />The writing is authoritative and learned, but not especially over-bearing or highly critical.  <br /> <br />Of special interest is the auction sales analysis for the works of each artist covered. (The sales stats only cover up to 1985, making them outdated, but still of interest.)  There are also knowledgeable essays on the dominant trends and \\"schools\\" of American art.  <br /> <br />The selection of artists and genres is wide-ranging. I was happy to see that great California impressionist painters such as Edgar Payne, Maurice Braun, Hanson Puthuff and others were not overlooked.    <br /> <br />Overall, this is a well-presented, nicely packaged overview of American Painting that can serve as an easy-to-digest art history, or helpful reference work for art collectors and gallery workers. Of course, contemporary fine art painters will also find much to ponder and be inspired by in these pages.	2005-03-31

Yeechh! Here, in this book, is an antidote to that residential architectural lobotomy. Here are far-out, totally unique, woodsy homes, the color photos of which get me as giddy as my first tree house. This is Northern California hippie architecture at it's \\"I'd rather do it myself; I don't believe in building codes\\" finest. Wood, wood, and lots more wood,  hacked and carved and pieced together according to blueprints of the heart and soul, and, in some cases, the apparent availability of of old logs and scrap lumber. To some, these might be considered hippie \\"shacks\\", but that would be not be accurate. These are homes and they exude warmth and character--and no drywall in sight, thank you very much. I see them as fairytale abodes of the backwoods.  I hope that  more residential architects and designers take a look at this book and capture from it the artistry and soul that is missing from so much residential building. If you ever loved a tree house or woodsy fort when you were a kid, and want to see what that feeling can be like when it grows up and doesn't forget its roots, check out this book. It's not a how-to book, there are no instructions, just photos of ideas realized, something to stir your mind, and help you forget about plaster and drywall. You could likely be inspired to head to the nearest lumber pile with  your hammer and saw and start building something, anything--a home, a treehouse, a dog house, a bird house--with a renewed artistic spirit and wide-open imagination.

This is powerful stuff that hits on many levels, one simply being that (rarely mentioned in U.S. history books or classes) Canada was a great place of refuge from the horrors that had entrapped slaves in the United States.<br /><br />In this book we get to hear, in their own voices, fugitive slaves, many whom had been free--but still fugitive-- for only a matter of weeks at the time their stories were recorded. They tell what their lives were like as a slave, and what it felt like to escape from that burden.<br /><br />The narratives are in various lengths, but all powerful, as the richness of these former slaves' humanity comes forth and the reader comes away thinking, \\"hey, these people sound just like you and me--except they had to suffer years of a living hell, being the property of others, in many cases being treated worse than a mongrel dog.\\"  We also hear from slaves whose masters were less cruel, but not so benevolent that their slaves did not wish to escape.<br /><br />The bottom line is there is plenty of  of first-hand information here that reveals the hearts and minds of recently escaped slaves, details of their lives,  and from that we are reminded of both the evil that had entrapped them, and the great longing for freedom that helped them escape from those chains.<br /><br />This book helps bring home the reality of slavery, something so horrible and wrong, but nevertheless something many Americans were more than eager to enforce less than 150 years ago.  There is something in the narratives of these former slaves that brings forth the reality of slavery in ways that are rarely touched upon in school text books. We need books like this to remind us of the evil that can arise so easily in people when given the chance to command power over others. As I said, these narratives are from less than 150 years ago--not long enough ago for all that evil to have completely evaporated.<br /><br />Can you imagine what is was like to be a slave in the United States? Few of us really can, even if we think we can. But this book makes it a little easier--and that's a good thing. Great book.ago for all that evil to have completely evaporated. <br /> <br />Can you imagine what is was like to be a slave in the United States? Few of us really can, even if we think we can.

This is a wonderful, lavishly illustrated book of modest physical dimensions, but immense in wealth of appreciation and education about the history and techniques of ukiyo-e woodblock prints of Japan, as the artform flourished from the mid-seventeenth to mid-nineteenth century.   <br /> <br />Written by a renowned Japanese expert and collector, this book is rich with information that spans all aspects of the artform that emerged from the merchant-townsman cultureof late-feudal-period Japan, depicting beautiful (and often licentious) women, Kabuki actors, and incredible landscapes and seascapes.  Much attention is given to the artists themselves and the social environment that motivated them to create this art of the \\"common people.\\" <br /> <br />This book includes 49 full color reproductions of woodblock masterworks, plus 129 black and white reproductions that trace the the history of the art from it beginnings with monocrhome prints to its cullmination with  polychrome masterpieces that would never be matched.  <br /> <br />This book will be an absolute delight and must-have for ukiyo-e collectors and will likely provide a revelation for those who are just beginning to explore and appreciate this form of classic art.	2004-11-03

I never knew how much I didn't know about motorcycles until I looked through this big, slick book. More than 2,300 motorcycle manufacturers are listed. It is great fun to look through this, checking out the more than 1,200 photos to see old favorite models,odd ducks, plus the hundreds of bikes from manufacturers I never knew existed. (Where in the world are the skeletons of all these old, strange bikes buried? You'd think they must decompose like bodies!) Spans more than 100 years of motorcylce history. I'm not giving this book five stars because there aren't photos of every bike mentioned, and many manufacturers don't get any photos and only a small write up. Even for the bigger name manufacturers, the write-ups are not comprehensive and overlook a lot of models, so don't expect this to be \\"definitive\\"  or especially technical. But it is still a joy to behold. To have a more comprehensive encyclopedia of motorcycles would take many volumes. This is a nice \\"coffee-table\\" overview of motorcycle history with lots of interesting bikes to ponder and a fair amount of information. It is the kind of book that may inspire some people into collecting old bikes. It is hard to imagine any motorcycle afficionado who wouldn't get some kick out of this. A worthy gift.	2004-09-18

Musings is too light a term to use for the warm, down-to-earth essays that Moore provides us as he shares his thoughts and experiences with life, art, and aesthetics. With the words are page after page of photos of Moore, his work, along with images of things that have been his inspirations. This is a book about art appreciation, but grounded in the practicality of a working, master artist who is humble and thoughtful. It is hard to imagine how any sculptor who hopes to create works of lasting greatness could not profit and indeed be inspired by knowing this book. But Moore's basic, fundamental philosophies about art and life make this a book of vital inspiration for just about anyone who likes to think of, and operate in the world, along artistic terms. It is a warm, friendly unimposing book grounded with the weight of deep truth and careful observation.	2004-02-25

With that said, this book is kind of cool and is worthy of being reviewed because I'm sure there are people out there who will have need for this kind of way-back-machine look at a time gone by. There is a wide variety of &quot;underground&quot; interiors here, and a few ideas to be gleaned, or at least a few things that might get the creative juices flowing for designers who need a little prodding about being adventurous and trying anything, or, conversely, reminders that the try-anything &quot;alternative&quot; approach can be taken too far or in the wrong direction. But then again, some of these interiors do look to be fun places to visit, but actually live in them, I'm not so sure. But I am sure that some interior designers or set designers will find that giving bookshelf space for this book will be worthwhile either as a historical document, hysterical document, or, as suggested already, an idea stimulator.	2004-02-21

I kept this in my car tape player for a week or so while doing short errands, and found myself sitting in the car in parking lots listening a little longer when I should have been getting out and getting my errands over with. Frazier is the ultimate dry-humorist with a very humble style, layering facts upon facts, upon observations notebook-style and leaving me chuckling without him ever having &quot;cracked a joke.&quot;  The tape simultaneously made me want to drive through the Great Plains while also making me feel that if I never do visit the region I have a much better idea of it.  I learned about Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, General Custer, contemporary folks, the land, much more. What is particular noteworthy about this tape, is that unlike so many audio books, this one is read by the author himself. While not the sonorous-voiced typical narrator I was expecting, I ultimately found Frazier's voice particularly charming and satisfying, knowing that probably no one else could capture the essence and tone of the work so well. There is compassion in his voice, enthusiasm, wonderment and wry humor. This tape set was fun, humorous, educational, heartfelt, and as open and breezy as the Great Plains.

About half the pages are for Williams' grand, celebratory poem--a poem of beauty and stark fact-- about whales, that includes history, biology, all the ways whales have enriched our society, both living and as a product, the tragic aspects regarding the thoughtless, non-sacred killing of the great beasts and details of hunting and processing, etc. Indeed, Williams' epic seems to include all aspects of the culture of the whale. The second half of the book contains hundreds of fascinating quotes about whales, culled from nearly every epoch of written human history, and serves the reader as a virtual encyclopedia about whales. The book is illustrated throughout with fine photographs, including beautiful full color photos of whales alive and well in their natural habitat, to photos depicting the myriad ways humans have exploited and profited from the whale. This is a good book, a song celebrating the sacredness of whales and lamenting our human society that  has for the most part  taken them for granted.

Although just shy of seven feet tall, he never made it to the pros, committing suicide after a string of disappointments, run-ins with police and other authority figures,  and the pressure of the public spotlight and expectations. It's a story that seems to repeat itself every few years, with just the names and the faces changing. In Presley's version, the story takes you from the streets of Detroit to the campus of Cal Berkeley amidst the political and black civil rights turmoil of the 1960s. This seems to be a fair and accurate account and may have seemed more vital or groundbreaking when it was written four decades ago.

The author writes poetically and impressionistically about his visits to California and New York and points in between. He is simultaneously impressed,  charmed, confounded, curious, and intrigued by this big country and its people, in contrast to Europe and Europeans. This is not so much a travelogue, but rather a gentle and thoughtful dissection of American culture, done in drive-by fashion, taking in the architecture, billboards, men and women on the sidewalks, the corner stop-and-shops, the geography, the highways, deserts, even the skies.  This is not a book putting down America, as one might eroneously assume, but neither is it a pat-on-the-back. For American readers, it will serve as a mirror that reflects striking realities, both flattering and not, that, nevertheless,  have become so common to us Americans that they are practically invisible to us, if not for the insightful light shined by this urbane French writer. Think of  this book as a French impressionistic painting of America,--more in the &quot;people-caught-in-the-act&quot; style of Manet, rather than Monet with his lillies and haystacks--where the mundane, the ugly,  the beautiful and the grandiose blend into a composition of insight, harmony and even-handed judgement of the particulars.	2003-10-20

The author explores a total of 62 ghost towns. It would be of interest to history buffs, explorers, and off-roaders, as well as nature lovers. It's interesting, even if you never venture out your front door. Weis is a great writer, with a light, lively and humorous style as he recounts the ups and downs of back roads, dirt trails and encounters with locals as he tracks down these lost worlds of the west.  And Weis is also truly an outstanding photographer, with dozens of dramatic black and white photos here to prove it. We've all heard about a handful of \\"tourist attraction\\" ghost towns, but this author, after checking out a few of those,  goes way beyond and finds all kinds of ghost towns that truly have been forgotten. Reading this book is truly inspiring, encouraging readers to go out and explore and find their own lost towns with their weed-filled roads and teetering buildings, and perhaps a few odd characters lurking about. Weis gives tips for how to study topograhic maps to discover old town sites and what it takes to get to them. This book really strikes a chord in the heart of all would-be explorers and western history buffs. This is truly an enjoyable book, mixing light history, exploration, and just plain fun. It includes maps, and lots of great info. Who knows what has become of these ghost towns since this book was written? Weis' book makes that a question most people who read it will be hankering to explore.	2003-10-02
US	46235601	R144ZTHB7SPNGU	051765282X	195291082	Sex in the Comics	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Good historical overview	This is a fine, large-format, serious-minded history of sex in 20th century  comics, that would be of interest to comic fans, comic artists, as well as art, social and cultural historians. It is fully illustrated, in both black and white and full color, and includes an index. There is about equal amounts text and examples of comics. This book covers a wide-gamut, from Lil' Abner, to R. Crumb to Cathy, to Frank Frazetta, to Penthouse's Wicked Wanda, and Playboy's Little Annie Fannie, and a smattering of the undergrounds. There is also an overview of comics in various countries throughout the world. There is a fair amount of explicit content, but  it is not gratuitous. It has a nice dustjacket, modest on the front, a little more risque on the back. I won't give this book a five star rating, because although this book covers a lot of ground, I'm sure there is a lot of territory not covered, and that someone could go into more scholarly depth on the subject.  (For instance, there isn't any discussion of how these comics relate to erotic art  prior to the 20th century.) But at the moment, I don't know of another book that is any more comprehensive. Bear in mind that this book is nearly 20 years old.	2003-09-08

The title is misleading however.This book focuses on bitchen electric guitars, their history, the wild and unusual models, the classics, and specific legendary guitars used by the guitar gods like Hendrix, Clapton, etc.. It's full of photos and great facts, and the lineage of models and history of the manufacturers. What is really neat are the photos of all the odd models made by companies other than the big names like Fender and Gibson. Besides all the fine photos and great layout, there is a lot of interesting information about the influence and use of various guitars on different bands and sounds from the sixties. The layout is really something--not only are there photos of cool guitars, there are also photos of vintage magazine ads for various guitar models, photos of rarely seen album covers from obscure sixties guitar bands, etc. Reading is not necessasary to enjoy this book! But there is plenty to read as well. This is a fun book.  Anyone who has ever looked longingly at some old electric guitar on stage or hanging on a shop wall is sure to get a kick out of  this book. Great gift.	2003-08-30

What would you expect from a book compiled from the best feature articles from one of the best movie-making magazines?  With an introduction by Frank Capra? This is great stuff. Having been published in the early 1970s, it naturally focuses mostly on the great directors and their work in the 1960s and early 70s.  So that means you have articles and interviews with Stanley Kubrick, Alfred Hitchcock, Roger Corman, Don Siegal,  Robert Altman, Richard Lester, Gordon Parks, Mel Brooks, John Frankenheimer, so much more. There's a large section detailing John Ford and his masterpiece Stagecoach. There's a section on notable first films that serves as a great reminder of some overlooked gems of film making that you will want to track down. I can't imagine anyone who's serious about film making who would not enjoy this book. It's like a great issue of a great magazine--you can open it up at nearly any page and start reading and start enjoying and start learning and appreciating, and wanting to go watch some geat movies that you may have overlooked or not fully absorbed. It's fun.	2003-08-28

It's all presented in a common-sense, practical and bright style--it's a classic.

Has brief histories of the crafts, along with black and while illustrations of dozens of examples of collectible objects. Also a glossary of terms, a listing of manufacturers (both old and new) and information about the often very difficult task of dating of  treen objects. This book is certainly helpful and informative, but may not be as in-depth as some would prefer, but to suit those readers, the author has graciously provided a bibliography for more in-depth study.  Some may also wish that there were photographed examples of objects instead of just drawings, although the drawings are good, detailed  ones and may actually be of greater clarity  and detail than simple photographs. This book is certainly a good starting place for collectors.	2003-05-20

Homes and Interiors: of Taos, Santa Fe and the Southwest	Books	5	6	6	N	N	A treasure for architects and serious decorators	Any architect or serious interior decorator exploring, or deeply into, the southwestern style will not be disappointed with this book. It is filled with hundreds of photos of interior and exterior features, including wide-angle views encompassing entire rooms, showing southwest fine art and artifacts in a domestic context. Don't be surprised that most of the photos are black and white--although there are dozens of color photos too. Instead, appreciate the play of light and shadow that finely crafted adobe structures have at their command. Black and white photos show this in high contrast. But don't let the photos overshadow the text that will provide an education to adobe architects of all levels. Anyone iiving in a true adobe, and wants to follow a classic southwest theme, will find lots of inspiration--and then the hunt will be on to find the kind of indigenous southwest decor seen here.	2003-01-14
