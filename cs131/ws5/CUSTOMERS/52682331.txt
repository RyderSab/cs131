I have read every Xanth book from the beginning, but this will be the last one I read.  My wife said she gave up on this series long ago, about the time the Adult Conspiracy subplot started.  At first, the AC was just an  annoyance, but it has now just about completely taken over.  As I mentioned  in my review of &quot;Zombie Lover,&quot; it is not the sexual references  themselves that bother me, just the fact that they seem to me to be  jarringly out of place in Xanth books. As bad as the AC is, this book is  pretty lame all the way around.  Other than a few well-placed zingers at  Microsoft in the first chapter, there is little fun in this book.  For all  the enjoyment I have had from reading Xanth in the past, I am grateful.  I  am just sad that it has come to an end.	1999-12-01

It is interesting to read through the reviews, from the ones that say they want to give this book 6 stars or more, to those who say 1 star is too much.  Yet, the overall average is 4 stars, which in my opinion is the  correct rating, so perhaps that proves that the rating system works pretty  well, at least when there are a large number of reviews.  This is by no  means the best book ever written, nor is it laugh-out-loud funny  throughout.  One reviewer called it &quot;Carl Hiaasen Lite&quot; and I  think that is a fair assessment.  It is a quick, fun read and quite funny.   It does have a plot, and a suspenseful ending.  Even though the actual  ending was not that surprising, Barry did have me wondering how he was  going to get rid of the bad guys and save the good guys.  I think that Dave  Barry has a future in fiction, but I would agree with those who feel his  nonfiction is better.  I feel confident that he will continue to write  sucessfully in both areas.	1999-11-05

I am not a big reader of true crime books, but I had for some time wanted to read a book about the Charles Whitman murders.  I had always assumed there were books about it, but it turns out this is the first book devoted  solely to this case.  That is surprising to me.  This was a very  well-documented book, and it pointed up some of the many misconceptions  about the Tower shootings. The author also points out some of the  inaccuracies in the movie, &quot;The Deadly Tower.&quot;  The only minor  point I would like to have seen that was missing from the book would've  been a list of the victims, and even more &quot;Where are they Now&quot;  type information in the appendix.  It is not possible to completely make  sense of such a horrifying event as this, but this book does a good job of  explaining the unexplainable.	1999-09-20

Some of the reviews have compared this to the Bruce Willis movie &quot;Armageddon.&quot;  I have to admit I didn't see the movie, but I think the comparisons are very superficial.  If I had to compare it to a  movie, it would probably be &quot;When Worlds Collide.&quot;  Speaking of  movies, I doubt that Hollywood will make one of this book, and if they did  they would probably butcher it, but it might be worth it just for the  special-effects spectacular that would be needed for the ending.  The basic  idea of a large object colliding with Earth is not new, but it was handled  very well in this book.  There were also some echoes of the first Hogan  novel, &quot;Inherit the Stars.&quot;  Hogan doesn't do as many sequels  as some writers, but it would be interesting to see what he could follow  this up with.  It sure wouldn't be set on Earth, unless it was much further  in the future.  I made the mistake of picking this up to read a little  bit before going to sleep, when I was about 150 pages from the end.  I  ended up finishing it, and was really dragging the next day.  As I said  above, the way it ends is not too big a surprise, except perhaps for the  extent of the disaster, and you knew the hero would survive, but it still  keeps you going.  I have read a lot of science fiction that was exciting,  and a lot that was intellectually stimulating, especially by James Hogan.   This book combines both and does it very well.	1999-09-16

Book Three was the final one in the series, which is probably the best thing that can be said about it.  I feel that the writers' goal in getting involved with this  project, other than making money, was to attract Asimov fans to read their  other works.  In my case, at least, they have failed.  If there is anything  that can break a deeply-ingrained habit of finishing a series once it is  started, this series is it.  There are some decent moments in this book,  but it is confusing and filled with pointless activity that ultimately  accomplishes very little.  I gave it 2 stars only because it does tie  everything together and because of the timeline in the appendix.  I checked  this book out from the Library.  I absolutely cannot recommend that anyone  pay hardcover prices for this one.	1999-09-07

I actually read this about a month ago, but for some reason Amazon was not accepting reviews.  I guess that is because the US edition isn't out yet.  I occasionally have a chance to get the UK edition, which is why I have  already read this.  Anyway, this was a great book.  Not as many  laugh-out-loud moments as some of the Discworld books, but it more than  makes up for that by having a more engaging and interesting story than most  of this series.  Obviously, I am a big fan of this series.  Given the  popularity of vampires in fantasy fiction nowadays, it was perhaps  inevitable that Pratchett would put his own spin on the sub-genre.  It such  a good story that it would've been worth reading, perhaps three stars, with  no humor at all.  For those who think Terry has been slipping a bit lately,  all I can say is read this one.  As good as the Discworld series is, my  all-time favorite of his was the collaboration with Neil Gaiman, &quot;Good  Omens.&quot;  Wouldn't it be fun to see him do a vampire collaboration with  Kim Newman?  Just a thought.	1999-09-07

The multiple story lines are sort of a two-edged sword.  They do make the story a bit harder to follow.  I found myself frequently referring to the list of characters in the  beginning of the book.  The plus side is that all the characters were  interesting, each in his or her own way.  There is a certain amount of  analogy between this war and our own World War II.  There is Algarve as  Germany, Unkerlant as Russia, Forthweg as Poland, and so forth.  There is  even magical research similar to the Manhattan Project.  One analogy that  isn't there, is I don't see who corresponds to the United States, as a  major power that sits out the early part of the war, then play a decisive  role in the final outcome.  Perhaps that will happen in later volumes.   Others have commented about how you cannot really tell who are the good  guys, if there are any.  I forget who said it, but I remember a quote that  said something to the effect that everyone is a hero in their own story.   All of the viewpoint characters are convinced that their side is the right  one, thought a few are slowly learning otherwise.  This story is definitely  worth reading, alhough I would like an explanation of a few things here and  there.  For example, the &quot;eggs&quot; are referred to early on as  dragon's eggs, but as many of them as there are, it would seem they would  have to be artificially or magically created rather than laid by dragons.   All in all, I would say this is a notch below the Worldwar/Colonization  series, but still well worth reading.  I look forward to future volumes in  this series.	1999-08-22

I am of an age to have read Heinlein and Asimov's juveniles when I was a teenager, although most of them I read as an adult.  I read this book primarily because I am a big fan  of James Hogan.  I have not read any of the other Jupiter Novels, but I get  the feeling from reading some of the descriptions and reviews on Amazon  that there is a specific formula or &quot;bible&quot; that is set up for  this series. That is not bad in and of itself, but I couldn't help but feel  that Hogan was a bit constrained by this format.  I remember the Heinlein  juveniles as being a bit more free-wheeling.  I would say that if you are  an adult fan of Hogan, don't expect too much of this one.  If you are a  teenager and have enjoyed the other books in the Jupiter series, you will  enjoy this one as well.  It is a quick read, the characters are likeable,  the science is realistic, and the changes in the main character and his  friends as they come of age are believable.	1999-07-12

I have read every installment in the David Sullivan series, have seen the characters grow up from teenagers to confident and competent young adults.  I have enjoyed every one thoroughly.  This final one is certainly no  exception.  A previous reviewer stated that you can pick this one up and  get involved in the story even if you haven't read the earlier books.  I  don't really disagree with that, but I would still recommend reading the  earlier ones first.  All this assumes that this really is the last one.  Like most writers, Deitz has left a few loopholes that might lead to  another book, although he has wrapped up just about all of the ongoing  story lines.  If this is the last one with these characters, then it was an  action-packed finale, which also showed the very human successes and  failures of the mortal and Faery participants.  If there is to be a  continuation, it will most likely feature Calvin's heritage, I would think.  Either way, this was a very good book, which I suggest you read as soon as  you can.	1999-06-23

Not every story is laugh-out-loud funny.  Every story IS worth reading, which is not the case with every anthology you might pick up, especially a  &quot;theme&quot; anthology.  The only mild complaint I would have was  there was no Mathemagics story by Margaret Ball.  Despite that slight  disappointment, I would recommend this installment in what I really hope  will be a continuing series.	1999-06-12

This book was very much worth reading and I enjoyed it.  I just can't quite give it 5 stars.  I cannot put my finger on anything major, just a few minor things here and there that made it not quite as good as the  previous ones in the series. One complaint I have is that the character  of Dietz wimped out at the end.  The problem of two diverse story lines was  a bit distracting at times, but that was tied together pretty well.  However, there was a major glitch, in my opinion, with the explanation of  how the hit man was always able to find Kinsey.  I don't want to give that  away, but I will say that it was not very believable.  This is not so much  a stumbling point in the series as a leveling off.  I still eagerly look  forward to reading the rest of this series.	1999-05-10

I finished this book a few days ago, and have since been debating whether to submit a review or not.  I am a big fan of Terry Pratchett's.  He is one of the few authors that I will buy in hardback, and the only one that I  will buy the UK editions of his books, despite the high price on this side  of the pond.  I missed the UK edition, so I read the US one of this book.   The problem with this book is hard to describe.  It's not like it wasn't  funny.  It was.  I guess the usual lack of continuity was a bit more than  in other books.  Perhaps I missed more of the &quot;in&quot; jokes than  usual.  Reading the other reviews of this book, there seems to be little  middle ground.  I think that is what I am trying to provide with this  review, middle ground.  This was far from the best of the series, but it  wasn't as disappointing as some of the reviewers would have it.  Bottom  line, I don't hesitate to recommend this book.  Just don't expect it to be  quite as good as others in this series.  I have the UK edition of  &quot;Carpe Jugulum&quot; and I look forward to reading it soon.	1999-05-08

I have been a big fan of James Hogan ever since I first started reading &quot;Inherit the Stars&quot; more than 10 years ago.  The only down side of that is that when I get a collection like this, it inevitably contains  some material that I have already read.  &quot;Madam Butterfly&quot; was  excellent, I would say that it was worth getting this book for that story  alone, although it is also available in other anthologies.  Plus, there  were three other stories, &quot;Identity Crisis,&quot; &quot;Last  Ditch,&quot; and &quot;Zap Thy Neighbor&quot; that were new to me and quite  enjoyable.  &quot;Leapfrog&quot; and the novella &quot;Out of Time&quot; I  had read before, but were worth a re-read. The non-fiction articles were in  two categories: amusing auto-bographical sketches, and thought-provoking  and sometimes controversial science articles.  If you are a Hogan fan, as I  am, you should definitely read this.  If you are new to his work, this book  could serve as an introduction.  Either way, I heartily recommend it.	1999-04-12

This time Spenser takes on two cases for the price of one, which is zero.  He even mentions in passing another case he had that he didn't get paid for.  When was the last time he made any money?  I don't think he is  independently wealthy, so I guess he just makes money off the boring cases  that we don't read about.  Or maybe Susan is supporting him?  That aside,  this was a good story with lots of twists and surprises.  I would like to  have seen a bit more of a confrontation with the guys who threaten to kill  Spenser and Hawk.  They do get theirs in the end, but that is largely  offstage.  The strength of this book, as always, is the interplay among the  characters.  The resolution of the stalking subplot was really good, we get  to see an unexpected side of Susan. I enjoyed this book, but I still wonder  if Parker would keep writing them if his financial arrangements were the  same as Spenser's.	1999-04-08

I enjoyed this book, but I suspect I would've enjoyed it more if I were more familiar with the Edgar Rice Burroughs Barsoom stories.  Recursive SF is like alternate history in that you have to be familiar with the original  material in order to get full enjoyment out of it. Also, this is not much  like most of Niven's other work, so that may be a problem for some of those  who prefer only &quot;Hard&quot; science fiction.  That said,  I recommend  this book for a quick, entertaining read.  It does help, as a previous  reviewer stated, to read the short stories first.  In fact, I think the  book should've been printed in that order.	1999-04-05

It is probably pretty easy to write a book where a one-dimensional, uninteresting protagonist solves an easy mystery.  It would be harder to write one where that same character solves an intriguing mystery, or where  an interesting, multi-faceted protagonist solves a boring mystery.  It is  perhaps easiest of all to baffle the readers throughout, then pull a rabbit  of the the hat at the end, trying to be clever.  Sue Grafton does not take  any of these easy routes.  Kinsey Millhone is a very interesting,  believable, just plain human, character.  The mystery in this 6th  installment plays fair.  Until the very end, you have several choices of  who the culprit might be.  The actual killer was not a total surprise, but  wasn't one of the ones I was thinking were most likely.  I enjoyed this  book, and I recommend it highly.  By the time I get a chance to read the  rest of the current books, &quot;O is for Outlaw&quot; should be out, then  I guess I will have to eagerly await each future book, just like those who  have been reading this series all along.	1999-03-24

I do not consider myself to be a big Horror fan.  I have read all of Lovecraft's works, and recently have been enjoying Kim Newman's Anno Dracula series.  A comment that Newman posted on this site led me to get  this book for his story, &quot;Coppola's Dracula.&quot;  That was  definitely my favorite story in the book, but I was pleasantly surprised  that most of the other stories were decent as well.  Like almost all  anthologies, there are some stories that were not so hot, but there were no  absolute clunkers, in my view.  I would recommend this book to anyone who  enjoys horror fiction, whether they are a long-time fan, or a relative  new-comer like I am.	1999-03-23

There is less action than the Worldwar series, but that is offset by a build-up of suspense.  The mystery attack on the Colonization fleet, the secrecy about the purpose of the &quot;Lewis and Clark,&quot;  the  unsettling effects of ginger on the females of the Race, all serve to make  you wonder what will happen next.  Although I was not as dispointed as some  readers by the ending of the first series, I still find myself hoping that  humanity will eventually have a complete triumph. However, Turtledove  does seem to love a massive number of sub-plots, not all of which seem  meaningful.  What, for instance, is going to come out of the scenes with  Straha?  Nonetheless,  to my way of thinking, one test of the first book of  any series is whether it leaves you wanting to read the next one.  This  book, while not as good as it could be, certainly passes that test.	1999-03-21

I am obviously a latecomer to this series, but I am enjoying each book I  have read so far.  If they keep getting better as they go along, I expect  to be in for quite a treat by the time I get to &quot;N&quot; or perhaps  &quot;O&quot; by the time I get that far.  I don't read a lot of mysteries,  but I find I can usually guess pretty well what is going to be the  solution, but this one surprised me completely.  I would recommend this  series to anyone.  It is not absolutely necessary to read them in order,  but I would suggest you do that if possible.  Kinsey Millhone is a very  interesting character, one who is smart and tough, but also vulnerable and  fallible.  I look forward to running through the entire alphabet, but I do  wonder what Grafton will do for &quot;Q&quot; or &quot;X.&quot;	1999-02-28

One of the first recommendations I received from Amazon.com was &quot;Anno Dracula.&quot;  I had barely even heard of the book, but my wife had bought a copy, so I decided to read it.  &quot;The Bloody Red Baron&quot; quickly  followed, then this latest book.  I don't want to give away too much, but  it does appear that &quot;Judgment of Tears&quot; may be the last in the  series.  I hope not, because I feel the series is getting better with each  book.  Many people felt that book three would be set in World War II, and  that might've been good, but it might also have been a bit of &quot;been  there, done that.&quot;  By setting this one in 1959, with frequent  references to what did happen in WWII, Newman kept continuity while  breaking new ground. The setting in Rome really added to the flavor of the  book.  This is a serious book, but there is also a lot of humor and satire.   Newman probably better hope that Ian Fleming wasn't a vampire, or he might  rise from the grave to seek revenge for the send-up of James Bond. Vampires  seem to be a popular theme nowadays, but Newman seems to have staked  (sorry) out his own territory.  Regardless of whether or not he continues  this series, I am eagerly awaiting his next novel.  Meanwhile, I plan to  get his other novels and read them.  If you haven't read this series, you  do need to start at the beginning.  If you have already read the first two,  but haven't read this one yet, what are you waiting for?	1998-11-17

Dave Barry doesn't mention his actual birthday, but from some of the clues in the text, he is just about exactly one year younger than I am.  Thus, I can relate to most of what he is talking about throughout.  There was more  serious commentary than I am used to seeing in his books, but it was very  appropriate and enjoyable.  Even though I did serve in the U.S. Army from  1967-1970, though not in Vietnam, I was not offended by the section when he  talks about his avoiding military service.  I know there will be some  people who will think of him as a draft dodger, but that wasn't a problem  for me.  Instead, it was interesting to see a little bit of the person  behind the ever-present wisecracks. I don't know if many other folks would  compare Dave Barry to the late Lewis Grizzard, but I am a big fan of both.   Dave doesn't show us quite as much of his serious side as Lewis did, but  since Lewis was also a boomer, I think they both have some things in  common.  I don't know if they ever met or if they were friends, but for  some reason there were aspects of this book that made me think of Lewis  Grizzard.  Dave Barry may or may not take that as a compliment, but it is  intended to be one.  I thought this was a very good book, the only mild  criticisms I have are mentioned in previous reviews, that is the short  length and the ending of the year-by-year review in 1974.  I can hardly  wait till 2007 or 2008 when we will see &quot;Dave Barry Turns 60.&quot;	1998-11-09

This is not a bad book, but it would have been better if the author would  concentrate on story-telling and humor, including the inevitable puns.  I  am no prude.  There is nothing wrong with sexual innuendo, or outright sex  for that matter.  I read plenty of books that have sex in them.  That said,  I think the whole Adult Conspiracy sub-plot is getting way out of  proportion in recent Xanth books.  No one reads Xanth books looking for  titillation.  Also, why the thinly veiled social relevance?  Anthony is  always complaining about the &quot;cri-tics&quot; and I begin to wonder if  he is responding to them by force-feeding political correctness into the  stories.  There is plenty of fiction, even fantasy fiction, on the market  that addresses serious issues.  Xanth books are marketted as being light  entertainment, so why not provide that?  Despite all that, I enjoyed the  book.  I just would've enjoyed it a lot more without the coyness and PC  attitude.	1998-10-23

I see that another reviewer has already commented on the same points I was  going to make, and on the same stories.  I realize that in order to be  interested in Alternate History, one needs to be well-versed in  &quot;real&quot; history.  However, there are very few of us who are  knowledgable on all facets of history.  The story about the Goeben read  like a good war story, but not being familiar with the actual history of  the event hurt my enjoyment of it as an Alternate History story.  Other  stories in the book were also hurt by the lack of introductory material.   For example, I got the point of the story &quot;A Hard Day For Mother, but  I wouldn't have if I hadn't seen the movie &quot;Gettysburg.&quot;  I could  not help but wonder if there weren't a lot of readers who missed the point  of that one.  Also, there were several typo's in that story that were  annoying.  I don't know who to blame for that, perhaps an over-reliance on  spell-check programs.  Those will not catch the use of &quot;out&quot; when  you meant &quot;our&quot; for example.  This is admittedly minor, but it is  something that shouldn't have happened in a professionally published book.   I realize that Turtledove was not the sole editor, even though his name was  the only one on the cover, but if he is going to be the one up front,  perhaps he should've looked at these things.  This was a good book, but it  could've been a lot better with the attention to a few details like  introductions and proofreading.	1998-10-03

One  of the stories, &quot;Jotok,&quot; did not involve humans and the telepath  connection was not obvious.  Since it was not a Man-Kzin conflict, I  wondered why it was in this anthology, although it was certainly a  well-done story.  I don't suppose there are enough Jotok-Kzin Wars stories  to make up a book.  This may sound like a complaint, but it isn't.  In  fact, the more I think about that story, it does serve as background to the  Man-Kzin Wars.  Another intersting thing about this book is the fact that  all the stories involve either first contact between humans and Kzin, or  are set early in the first war.  That, combined with the Jotok story, which  is set very early in the history of the Kzin empire, probably in  prehistoric times on Earth, makes this book more of a prequel to the other  books in the series.  I enjoyed all five stories, and believe any Known  Space fans will like it also.	1998-09-22

Since I had been looking for this book in used book stores for some time,  then finally got it by placing an out-of-print order with amazon.com, it  seemed only fair that I review it here.  Like most short-story collections,  this is a bit uneven, but most of the stories are above average.  Some,  like &quot;The Boring Beast&quot; are very funny.  Others, like &quot;The  Last Article&quot; and &quot;The Road Not Taken,&quot; are very original  and thought-provoking.  Several of the stories have appeared in other  collections or anthologies.  This book is not easy to find, but if you can  get your hands on it, it is well worth your time.	1998-08-23

When I first started reading &quot;Running with the Demon,&quot;  I was a bit apprehensive, because it was obviously a departure from Brooks' Shannara and Landover series, both of which I had enjoyed.  Not only is in set in contemporary times, but it is darker and very introspective.  That said, I enjoyed &quot;Running&quot; very much.  This sequel is certainly worth reading, but it didn't quite live up to the previous work.  For one thing, it is much shorter, which isn't always bad, but in this case it seemed like there was just less story there.  There is also some truth to the contention that you can guess early on who the demon is, but it is not as blatant as some reviewers would have it.  I was still in doubt a little bit until the very end.  Part of the problem there was the fact that there were only two or three possibilities for the identity.  The part I liked the most was the fact that both Nest and John Ross were forced to come to terms with their magic, in so! mewhat surprising fashion.  I don't know if this series is destined to be a trilogy or longer, but there seems to be somewhat of a tradition that the second book of a trilogy is the weakest.  This book is not bad, but I do hope that Brooks picks it up a bit in the next one.	1998-08-09

What makes this book interesting is the shifting points of view and the &quot;pox on both their houses&quot; style.  In most war books, the author has an &quot;Us vs. Them&quot; mentality.  In Turtledove's Worldwar Series, it was Humans vs. Lizards.  Here, you don't know who to root for.  Should you root for the North because they won in &quot;real life&quot; and opposed slavery, or against them because they are allied with Germany, are the first to use poison gas, and don't treat Negroes much better than the South?  Should you root for the South because they are the historical underdogs and are aligned with Britain and France or against them because they still treat the freed slaves like dirt?  Or do you root for those on both sides who plot revolution, the Negroes, the Socialists, or the Mormons?  Turtledove may know who the good guys are, but he isn't telling us yet, which is both interesting and frustrating.  Like some of the other reviewers here, I have to state that some of the subplots should be eliminated.  Still, one wonders, what is next?  Does the title &quot;American Front&quot; imply that the next book will be &quot;European Front,&quot;  and all the plots left hanging here will continue to dangle until some future volume?  I guess that is what defines a good series, is if the first book leaves you panting for more.  This book certainly does that.  Also, to those who said they would wait for the paperback next time, try your local Public Library,	1998-07-07
US	52682331	RVLKJEZHTZP8N	0671878786	222459126	Star Child	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Excellent book by an excellent writer.	I could be accused of being biased, since I have been a BIG fan of James P. Hogan ever since I first picked up &quot;Inherit the Stars&quot; over ten years ago, but I would have to say that &quot;Star Child&quot; is one of the best books I have read in some time.  It is a collection of four linked stories about Taya and her robot mentor Kort.  The first Story, &quot;Silver Shoes for a Princess&quot; was originally published in 1979.  In that story, Taya is 9 years old and travelling through space aboard a mysterious spacecraft called Merkon, headed toward a star called Vaxis.  I don't want to give away too much of the story, but in the second story, Taya is 19 and they are just landing on the planet they call Azure.  In the third story, she is in her 40's, and we learn more about the mystery of Merkon.  In the final story, she is an old woman and Kort must face what will happen to him when she dies.  Hogan is adept at presenting us with a puzzle, which is gradually unravelled in a logical manner.  Even aspects that might otherwise be thought of as spiritual or mystical are examined in a rational way.  If you are a Hogan fan, as I am, you should run, not walk, to your favorite bookstore and snap this one up!  If you have read a few, or even none, of his previous works, I would urge you to do likewise, then look for his other books.  Either way, you are in for a treat.	1998-06-27
US	52682331	R1ASEOTRYMJ324	0345412400	904445099	Mind Matters	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Tough going, but worth the effort.	I started to say I &quot;enjoyed&quot; this book, but it seems to be this is not the type of book that one &quot;enjoys.&quot;  I have read everything of James P. Hogan's work I could get my hands on, and he is one of my top two or three favorite writers.  This is non-fiction, but it reflects the same clear and interesting style of his fiction.  I would say that this book is not for a casual reader, nor was it intended as a textbook, though at some points it may seem that way.  Artificial intelligence is a very interesting and widely misunderstood subject, and perhaps the greatest value of this book is in exploding some of the myths about AI.  This is not a quick, easy read, but for the layman who wants to learn more about AI, it is well worth the time and effort involved in reading it.	1998-05-14
US	52682331	R2QCZGWY8FQ1PF	0312862024	737885864	Between the Rivers	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Not your typical Turtledove, but worthwile.	I first noticed Harry Turtledove when he kept showing up in anthologies.  When the Worldwar Series came out, I jumped at that, and have since been reading his older material, but also keeping up with new work as it comes out.  If you only think of Harry Turtledove in terms of alternate history, this book is not what you would expect.  It has some echoes of &quot;The Case of the Toxic Spell Dump&quot; in style, but it really doesn't compare that closely with any of his previous work that I have read.  It is a fantasy set at the beginning of the Bronze Age, in what would appear to be an analog of Mesapotamia, but with different place names and with actual living, breathing gods.  The gods are definitely superhuman, but fall a long way short of being omnipotent.  As in most of his work, Turtledove leaves room for more,  While I still prefer his alternate history science fiction, this fantasy was very enjoyable, with characters that you will care about.  If there is a sequel(s), I would look forward to reading more about this world.	1998-05-14
US	52682331	R35HQ5SPNMQ2YK	0061052426	920320505	Foundation and Chaos (Second Foundation Trilogy)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Better than Benford, Not as good as Asimov.	After reading Foundation's Fear, I had my doubts about this one.  I was pleasantly surprised by Bear's version.  My biggest complaint about the previous volume was the &quot;Joan&quot; and &quot;Voltaire&quot; constructs, which were totally at odds with the established flavor of the Foundation series.  In this volume, they were de-emphasized, and I hope to see them totally eliminated from the third volume.  I have not read much of Bear's other works, this volume tends to encourage me to do so, as well as to look forward to the third volume a great deal more than the first book made me look forward to this one. If you were not happy with the first book, and are debating whether to give this one a try, I would say it is worth it.	1998-05-14
