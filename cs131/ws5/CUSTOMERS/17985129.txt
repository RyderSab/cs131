Recommended     ...    5  stars <br /> <br />The Review <br />Callie and the Stepmother  opens as Callie is hugging her dad goodbye.  Dad drives a truck, and Callie must stay home with her new stepmother Pam.  Everyone knows stepmothers are evil and do bad things when your dad is away.  To make matters even worse Callie also has a new fourteen-year-old stepsister.  To make matters even worse again Andrea doesn't like Callie and doesn't want to share her room with Callie.  Callie knows it is going to be a long two days before dad returns.   <br /> <br />Callie and the Stepmother is writer Meyers' first children's chapter book.  The work is an outgrowth of the writers' bedtime stories she made up for her son when he was younger.  The book offers a list of illustrations, table of contents and chapters meant to be enjoyed by middle grade readers.  The tale will lend itself to use as a `read to' for the younger set, while vocabulary used is within the reading scope of most 9 - 12 year olds.  Illustrations provided by artist Rose Gauss set the written word off to perfection. <br /> <br />   The misconception children often harbor regarding what is real and what is storybook is often blurred at best.  Meyers' Callie and the Stepmother takes those misconceptions, adds a likeable little girl Callie, a patient stepmother and a typical older step sibling and manages to meld them all into an interesting, entertaining, readable work.   <br /> <br />Excellent resource reading suggestion for the child therapists shelf, the home pleasure reading library, the blended home library, home school and classroom reading corner. <br /> <br /> This is a book I would use in my own classroom for a unit on family, understanding and working through fear and misunderstand. <br /> <br />Enjoyed the read, happy to recommend. <br /> <br />Reviewed by: molly martin       <br /> <br />20+ years California classroom teacher <br />  <br />	2005-08-11

Recommended    .............     4.5  stars <br /> <br />The Review <br />The narrative opens in a small Alaska with someone sneaking into the window.  The house is empty. Marty lays her sleeping bag on the floor and lays down to sleep.  The new school year will begin and Marty, Martha, will be facing it without her boy friend Steven.  Marty, her sisters Gwen and Dottie live with their working Mom and sometime when home from the Coast Guard dad.  Marty has had the summer to come to grips with Steven's death.  School begins, a new owner for the movie theater where Marty works comes to town, life goes on.  Then, Fish and Game begin to make noises about re opening the investigation into Steven's death.  He was well versed in living in the wild and they are wondering how he and several more recent campers have come to be the victim of an accidental shooting.  Winter melts into spring.  Marty sends applications to colleges and faces the questions put to her by Fish and Game. Life goes on. <br /> <br />Writer Lion has wrought an appealing mystery certain to please the young adult market.  Overflowing with exhilarating settings, a genuine conundrum and believably human characters Upstream is an engaging read.  Writer Lion's adroitness for the human situation and her cloudless portrayal haul the reader right into the chronicle.  Lion possesses a perception for the human inner self which she puts to skillful use to furnish a narrative filled with tingle, sentiment and coming of age.  The reader is drawn into the tale from the opening lines as we accompany Marty into the now deserted home of her dead boy friend and that interest is held tight right down to the last page where we find Marty now grown up, finished with college and following her life dream.   <br /> <br />Upstream is writer Lion's second work and is a commendable effort.  That writer Lion has done her homework into people, activities, and tenor of youth is manifest as the anecdote unfolds.  Lion uses occasional flash back type scene setting to explain what has led to Steven's demise.  Brimming with a profusely fabricated chronicle, snappy, fulfilling conversations, in addition to a judiciously interwoven theme regarding a young woman coming to grips with life and herself Upstream is an agreeably composed work.  Characters presented by writer Lion are creditable, discussion is acceptable as it serves to move the narrative along from beginning to end.   <br /> <br />An indisputable winner for the target audience of young adult to adult aficionados of `slice of life' accounts.  The well written account has ample action to satisfy readers. Upstream is an superb choice for the middle to high school level home sch0ol or public school libraries, home library shelf as well as gift book selection for readers ages 13 and up who possess good reading skills and have an enjoyment  for a gripping tale well told.  Oblique references to teenaged sexual activity will served to preclude some readers from enjoying the book. <br /> <br />Enjoyed the read, happy to recommend. <br /> <br />I received a hard back edition for review. <br /> <br />Reviewed by: molly martin       <br /> [...] <br />[...] <br />20+ years California classroom teacher <br />  <br />Genre: YA fiction <br />Author: Melissa Lion  <br />Line/Publisher Wendy Lamb Books/Random House <br />Random House, 1745 Broadway Avenue of Americas NYC, NY <br /> ISBN: 0 385 74643 <br />Available : $15.95  Amazon <br />	2005-06-09

From the opening lines as we peer into the deep blue waters of the Moray Firth right to the last pages when we find Zack married, with a child on the way, his night terrors a distant memory and National Geographic again funding his expeditions The Loch holds reader interest fast. <br /> <br />Alten's characters are well thought out zesty individuals, dialog is full of grit and acceptable, settings swell with particulars in this well written work.  It is obvious Writer Alten has done a good bit of research into the background surrounding Loch Ness and the myths surrounding it as well as investigation into the marine world and those who delve its depths. The storyline making up The Loch is filled with twists, turns and puzzlement.  This Scottish descendant especially delighted in the writer's lapses into history, vernacular and accent on the Scottish countryside.  First-hand witness chronicles of those who have seen, or are convinced they have seen something in the Loch as well as bits and pieces of chronicled fact add to reader enjoyment.   <br /> <br />Enjoyed the read, happy to recommend. <br /> <br />	2005-06-09

Molly's Reviews	Editor Gallagher has produced a book using contributions from real moms and meant to be used by real moms.  From start to finish the new mom is offered suggestions on everything from which type of formula is best and why individual women prefer one over the other to what features to look for in a stroller.  Moms who have faced late night diaper changes suggest one piece pajamas with zippers rather than cute footed garments that are hard to put on and take off.  Women who have faced sleep deprivation during the first weeks following the birth of their baby offer good sound advice to new moms concerning the importance for baby AND mom to get enough sleep.    Each hint is presented in clear, concise language and in type large enough to read easily.  Chapters are filled with short easily read hints new moms can read while nursing or bottle feeding their new baby, while waiting for the train to pass by or the light to change.  Format is sensible; few new mothers have time to plow through pages and pages of tiny print.	2005-05-30

On board a warship moving toward Cuba she was loathe to give up the dream she had been enjoying.  As yet Jill is unaware that her life and that of NFL Quarterback Terry Jackson will be caught up in the same dangerous scheme.       Writer Wegman is a career naval reserve officer who calls upon his knowledge of the military to produce a meritorious work filled with esotericism, excellent dialogue and zestful action.  Fans of fast paced suspense thrillers are offered plenty of each from this rousing chiller.  I enjoyed the character Jill Sinclair.  She is a strong woman with firm ideas as to right and wrong and what to do.  While easily read Caveat Games is not a formula work with the ending discerned by the end of the first few pages.  Wegman's exquisitely masterminded plot is set against a tapestry of engaging characters, powerful circumstances and compelling situations in this keenly focused tale.        Good book for a long afternoon spent lazing while reading in the shade of a tree on a summer afternoon. Caveat Games is a good addition to the home library pleasure reading shelf, the home school high school level reading program and for those who simply enjoy a well written, good thriller.    Caveat Games is available as both eBook download and paper versions.  I was sent a soft cover print edition for review.

She quickly learned that while there is often much verbiage about `programs' and the like; reality is parents of a handicapped child face many brick walls: day care, schools and society at large often do not want any in their midst but the `normal' kid.  Jade was born at a time when many Downs and other `different' kids were shunted into facilities where they were allowed to live as eternal children simply because no one knew or accepted that these kids can and will learn.  They learn a bit less, at a slower rate, but learn they do just as do their peers.  As Gail and Jade sat by the lake and watched `wheeshes' fly by, or visited the mall at Christmastime the pair behaved as any `normal' parent and child enjoying the day and time spent with each other.   <br /> <br />Natural Harmony Jade's Story is an excellent addition to the home library for those who enjoy a true slice of life type work.

Molly's Reviews:  Unassuming but puissant in significance and sentiment presented in an uncomplicated style; The Rite of Passage is enhanced by extension, showcasing a sequence of stirring reflections.  The free verse format is excellent here and effect space for the reader to participate in the emotions stirred by the poet's muse.  Charming verse with sweeping appeal.  I like the fervent explicitness of this distinctively expressed, refreshing write.  The flow is as the current running over a well worn riverbed in this eminent rhetoric.	2004-08-05

Family Meetings are suggested as a method for improving family and business relationships.  Joys and pitfalls of working with those in your own family is approached in a no nonsense manner laced with good straight forward hints, information and wisdom as well as a bit of humor and plain old common sense.  I found Michaud's discussion of communication and behavioral styles and how they affect business success to be especially enlightening.
