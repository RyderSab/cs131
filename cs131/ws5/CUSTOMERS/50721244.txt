US	50721244	R16EJFK9CGDLBX	081917680X	783677496	Goal Dust	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Page turner, true Pioneer Athlete, Actor, Multi talented man	One of the first two Black football players to play professionally in the USA, when white people still did not want to play sports with Blacks and lose to them in front of other whites. He also mentions how he developed one of the most versatile, muscular and lean physiques when weight training was not condoned by trainers (he performed 1000 pushups, situps and squats daily!). His departure for the Canadian League and the better reception he received there while also being embraced by his Native American brethren was touching too, Woody was part Native. He actually wrestled a bear that had its claws taken off!). Wrestling with many legendary personalities of the era like Gorgeous George (his coming to George's aid when his career was over while living in a run down motel is touching and sad), Hollywood was a natural especially being an ex football player/Wrestler and knowing many people. He always took care of both his families financially. His love for his Hawaiian wife and their long and happy relationship is an example for the rest of us. Insights into his relationship and experiences with such Hollywood actors as Lee Marvin (who kissed him in Las Vegas while drunk!), John Wayne (almost going to blows with the Duke in a stagecoach scene!) and his close relationship with the legendary film director John Ford are discussed. Hope more people get to know this pioneer and are moved as well as influenced by how he lived his life to the full without compromising his ethics or those around him. Highly recommended!!!	2002-12-08

Took only 3-4 days to read since it moved at a very fast pace with so many things happening in James Browns life. His upbringing, music, family, record companies, IRS, managers, riots, struggles are all here. Before reading this I was a big fan even though I was not sure of the place this man occupied in music, as an innovater and business person, now I do. The first man to popularize the &quot;live&quot; album, strict band leader, tireless composer/arranger, producer, drummer, singer, dancer and many more things that one person had in him (as well as surrounded himself with exceptional musicians and some exceptional business partners). Also learned of his ethnic background which is Asian/Black/Indian. Many roadblocks on the way and a glimpse of what the business end of the entertainment world is like round out an exceptional and candid look into the life of Soul brother number 1!	2002-06-06

Shows some of the questionable business practices at the top of any profession and shows a glimpse at what it's like to manage a profesional athlete to the top and all that comes with that too.

One of the grittiest, heart pumping books I have ever read. 6 stories all related to boxers, their trainers, cutmen and the eerie lifes that surround them. From a crooked fighter trying to rip off a cutman, to a young woman trying to convince an older trainer to be the first woman to be trained, to a story in the backdrop of the L.A. riots of the early 90's. I felt anger, sorrow, pride and happiness throughout. Waiting for Mr. Toole's next book!	2002-02-26

One of the best books ever written on boxing, specifically amature boxing. The author definately got into the fighter's interior as to why they do what they do. Describes details about the complex relationship between trainer and boxer. William Plummer tries himself a go at the ring by sparring with the best fighter in the gym only to find out that a key ingredient needed to fight is the animal instinct of defeating your opponent and inflicting pain (something he found he did not have, which is something that cannot be said about writing since this man can definately write!). If you want to find out about the inner workings of young men raised in urban areas with little escape from their surroundins except by jail, death or by entering the ring, this book will provide that and much more! Also recomended on boxing are \\"The Sweet Science\\" by A.J. Liebling, \\"On Boxing\\" by Joyce Carol Oates, \\"To Swallow a Toad\\" by Robert Preston Wood.	2002-02-09

Brutal no restraints forwardness about growing up a Russian Jew in Amsterdam, New York and eventually becoming a very talented actor. Stayed up quite a few nights and early mornings page after page not being able to stop until sleep crepted over! His accounts of going to college, actors school, early arrival in Hollywood, many encounters with other well known actors, directors and producers gives everyone an inside view of the lives behind the faces we see on the screen. One of the most memorable scenes is when he gets employment in a summer inn that caters to wealthy single ladies after he changed his name so as not to be rejected for being Jewish. The female owner of the inn takes a liking to him (and confesses her dislike of Jews often) and on the last night of the summer she invites him to her room. While  Douglas is having intercourse with her he whispers in her ear. &quot;how does it feel to be contaminated by a Jewish penis inside of you&quot; as he climaxes.<br />It does not get more prsonal than that.	2001-10-02

A very well documented biography on a genuine American and French hero. Unfortunately he was born during the Jim Crow era in the south (even though the constitution which was written over 100 years before his birth mentions &quot;all men are created equal&quot;, this did not include any non-caucasian's or women, did it? Did not use the word minority since it denotes less than some majority, there are more non-caucasian's in the world anyway and what is really meant by that word is just that, non-caucasian. I find it odd that the USA was founded by European descendants like the English, French and even though the country prided itself on it's progresive nature, it did not include equality, even though Europe itself did not practice racial discrimination). He was born the seventh child of a large family and his father always had a premonition of a very distinguished future for him and let it be known to him when he was young. Talks about his travel through the south after he left home and was told early by his father of a country (France) where all men are truly free. This had a profound effect on him because he eventually made it to France via England first. <br />He began his livelyhood as a theatre performer and boxer; two opposing and similar avocations. He joined the military and became the first Black American and Black Frenchman aviator and was awarded medals for his bravery, dedication and skills. Very well liked, he had a contagious personality and started working at a famous Paris club later in life and eventually became a club owner himself. He met the famous of the day like Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Langston Hughes, Bricktop and many others. This biography also got me interested in Jazz age Paris to request both autobiographies of Hughes and Bricktop.<br />Slowly (too slowly) more is being known about this man and his acomplishments and contributions to the human race.<br />You won't be able to put it down. Jack Johnson's autobiography &quot;In theRing and Out&quot; is another good bio of that era too.	2001-09-28

Software that tracks your clients specifically for mortgages or real estate, keeps info, prepares letters, estimates, comparisons all the way down to guiding the loan and real estate transactions to the closing stage with complete cruise control. I contacted many companies and they usually send free demos and I purchased the one that best suited my needs and it helped me maintain client info and keep contact with them while at the same time developing new relationships and approaching new potential customers with ease!<br />I was surprised that in a city of more than 80,000 inhabitants with surrounding population of another 80,000 in nearby towns I was one of maybe a handful of either real estate agents or loan officers who even used a software program! This is out of over 300 licensed realtors and another 40 loan officers!<br />This allowed me to close more loans a month than the majority, get more referrals and have an 85% to 95% customer loyalty with no advertising!!!<br />If you want to develop a clientele, maintain happy customers, track referrals and enjoy a business on cruise control in this business you need to use the latest technology to take you there (where few others are at!!!)!!!	2001-04-19

Motivated and influenced by this book I took an &quot;education&quot; vacation to Lucca, Italy in 1998 and took Italian language lessons at a school and stayed with an Italian family; this is my overall favorite vacation due to coming in contact with the native culture, language and making friends at the school to experience a foreign country with others.	2001-04-17
