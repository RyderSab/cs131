I had tried, in good faith, to read some of his other books, and had felt there was something going on that I couldn't understand. After reading this book it became clear to me. Mr. Shah is an academic opportunist. He found an overlooked tradition of mystical teaching and he was fluent in the language it was written in, so he began promting himself as an expert on it and also as an enlightened mystic.<br />This book here was written later in his life, I believe, and consists of one embittered rant after another about people not taking him, and Sufism, seriously enough. Apparently Mr. Shah hadn't sufficient self awareness to realize how he was coming across, or perhaps he had some oh so suble rationalization for why he was allowed, nay, even required, to be so thoroughly and continually foul tempered. He does show somewhat of a flair for rationalization in this book.<br />To me, Idries Shah was just a phenomenally pig headed man who noone around him ever had the guts to stand up to.	2002-08-20

I guess he just had a talent for self promotion.<br />Anyway, this book is very hard to read, it suffers a lot from the twisted syntax of a non-english speaker. Its hard to understand why the editors didn't try and clean it up and make it more readable. Perhaps Mr. Shah considered every word he wrote as golden and inviolable.<br />There is a lot of medieval scholarship thrown in the reader's face here and its easy to get snowed. But if you read it carefully you see that there is really only one message being put forward in this book, and that is that Sufism is an important and central mystical discipline. In fact, it is very likely the most important and seminal mystical discipline that ever existed, according to the author. These claims begin very early to start to ressemble the old joke about Russians always claiming that they had invented everything first, e.g., the radio, telephone, light bulb, everything. Very outrageous claims are made over and over again with a straight face.<br />The general tone of the book is extremely irascible and defensive. After having read as many lovey-dovey hippie mysticism books back in the early seventities, encountering this attitude in someone who professes to be fully steeped in mystic knowledge is nothing short of astonishing. If there is mystical illumination present here, it doesn't shine through very strongly. Instead it is shrouded by the black, billowing clouds of Mr. Shah's permanent spleen and distemper.<br />I did a casual survey of other sources on Sufism, and I was surprised to see that Idries Shah is never mentioned as a serious source. ...<br />You can read some of the chapters on interpreting the arabic of the ancient Sufi prophets for comic relief since the system of interpretation advanced is so loose that it allows absolutely anything you want to be read into them.	2002-08-20
US	52310842	R38FR60OJ9L48I	0899681794	930950913	Night Land	Books	4	30	37	N	N	amazing and exasperating	In broad outline, this book is cartoonish and childish, it reminded me a lot of the Marvel comics I read when I was a kid in the sixties.<br />But it's childishness is also its greatest strength, since Hodgson is the only author I know who can so potently conjure up the childhood terror of the dark.<br />Some of the visible monsters and hazards that are described are almost laughably preposterous, but Hodgson never blinks and ended up convincing me to suspend my disbelief.<br />One significant drawback is the meglomaniacal importance placed on the hero and his quest, it just doesn't quite ring true.  A modern anology would be the Apollo 13 moon mission, I suppose, when millions of people were all thinking and worrying and hoping for the safe return of a handful of astronauts.  So the phenomenon is not unprecedented, I just found that Hodgson treated it in an overly grandiose, facile and unconvincing way.<br />I read the same edition as one of the other reviewers below, the Ballantine one, and the second volume was somewhat edited, according to the preface.  A lot of the excess romantic stuff was deleted.  Even so, there are many long passages that are well nigh unreadable, because they are so over-the-top cutesy and mushy.<br />The faux 17th century writing style gets very wearing, as well, but it does succeed in significantly adding to the larger than life grandeur of the tale.  It's a pity that Hodgson was killed in WWI, if he had lived to edit it, and clean up the style to make it more convincingly 17th century, the book would have benefited tremendously.<br />And another of the endearing qualities of the story is that the landscape and basic story premise is very psychologically evocative of any person living a hopeless, dispirited existence. It really succeeds as a psychological allegory, in my opinion.<br />Speaking of psychological things, Hodgson succeeds in describing many human emotions in a very tangible and palpable way.  His<br />description of telepathic &quot;good vibrations&quot; pre-dates the hippies by many decades.  And he is also very good as evoking how one's emotional state can drastically alter one's life in a very marked, and even physical, way.  He was a writer of rare insight and sensitivity, and the world suffered a great loss when he died so young and needlessly.<br />It's been said in other places on the web, maybe not in these reviews here, that one of the most remarkable things about this book is that the tension is sustained for so long a time.  I have to agree.  One way that Hodgson does this is to adopt an almost journal-like structure for the story, each meal time in every day is covered, all along the quest.  This keeps the focus of the story narrow and close down on the hero's level, so you never stop empathizing heavily with him.<br />All in all, I would say, that if you are a fan of fantasy, then you should definitely give this a try, it's an amazingly original and engrossing fantasy.ic &quot;good vibrations&quot; pre-dates the hippies by many decades.

If Farmer had had any sense she would have enlisted the help of a ghost writer.  As it is, this book is written in the most harsh, strident, hateful manner imaginable.  The experiences themselves are unpleasant enough to begin with, but that is really immaterial.  Farmer could make a sunday box social seem like an ordeal of hate and strife.  With her horrendous attitude, it's no wonder they kept her locked up as long as they did.  If she didn't have the emotional intelligence, or tranquility, to realize that all she had to do was to cooperate and take responsibility for her life, she could have gotten out of the loony bin much sooner, I'm sure.  So this book just adds insult to injury by piling self justification upon self justification to create a mountain of chaotic spitefulness.  Farmer was given a great gift, but it was wasted by the simple fact that she lacked any real human affection or heart.  Of course I'm sure she did really suffer unjustly to a fair extent because of the antiquated and/or sub-standard treatment facilities.  But that doesn't let her off the hook in my opinion.  There's such a thing as maintaining one's dignity and shunning pity from others on the one hand and just being mindlessly hateful and grudgeful on the other.  Farmer never woke up to seeing that distiction, apparently.  This book is really too scary to even serve as an object lesson on how not to live your life.  It should be reserved for only those with the bravest hearts among us, to peer into the pit of chaos and despair and try to map its contours for the rest of us.	2001-06-09

This book is one of the few that I was sincerely sorry that it had to end.  My only complaint is that it is a little too slick, a little too Hollywood-ready.  It would be interesting to read an account that showed a little more of the warts-and-all detail of the experience.  It's a pity that this is out of print.  And in answer to one of the reviewers comments below about what this book says about Turkey, well, in my opiniion, this book is an attack on Turkey.  The author has almost nothing good to say about Turkey, and he never loses an opportunity to slag it off.  But I am definitely interested in finding books that portray modern Turkey, and other countries in this region, in a more positive light.  There never was a region that more needed reabilitating in the world's eyes, than the middle east today, I believe.  Another good reason to read this book is to show the difference between it and the popular film that was made of it.  It was quite an eye opener to me to find that two of the most horrific and lurid episodes that occur in the movie, do not occur in the book, most notably, the disgusting tongue-biting-off sequence.	2001-05-29

The author is a TV sportswriter and it shows.  I believe that the author had some genuine affection and devotion for Morrie, but he has not successfully captured that here.  Instead, his prose comes across as shallow, manipulative and insincere.  If I were the author, I'd take a year off and go live by myself in a remote cabin and re-write this book, ripping each word from my heart.  This book here is just too facile, too TV-esque.  The only thing that the author seems truly heartfuelt about is the awe in which he holds Ted Koppel and the Nightline program.	2001-05-29

Certainly not 400+ pages.<br />I read every word of this bloated mess, I'm sorry to say.  The bloating is accomplished by the inclusion of tons of irrelevant information.  Much of it is unnecessary incidental information, but one of the largest, and most irritating sources of bloat, is the inclusion of irrelevant biographical information.<br />To add insult to injury, the material relating to the families of the victims is handled in a very clumsy and insincere way.  The insult to the victims is further established by the silly title of this book, this phrase is supposed to be heard whispered on the wind by the ghost of the victims and is directed towards Charles Ng with respect to receiving the death penalty.<br />There's some interesting material in this book, but it's completely overwhelmed by shameless filler material.	2001-05-20

The main character, Karuna, from whose perspective the story is told, speaks of everything in her life with such coldness and cattiness, it's impossible to believe in the authenticity of the story.  It is also a very unpleasant experience for the reader to have to share such an emotionally arid experience of such long duration.  But, happily, Karuna starts to loosen up a bit and live a more connected life about half way through.  And by the time the book ends, Karuna's voice has become comfortable like an old sock.  And I suppose she is to be praised for never really totally letting go of her icy self possession throughout.<br />But the most interesting thing about this book is how much I learned from it as an, admittedly very provincial, American. The poeple of India are very poorly represented in American media, I feel.  It think many people in American still think of India as mostly populated with skeletal beggars brushing flies off their eyes with one hand while holding out a begging bowl with the other.  This book was a total eye-opener in that respect.  Karuna is a very savvy young woman.  She is, if anything, too westernized.  This book shows that affluent, well educated Indians are not in the least bit shy about moving around in western dominated culture and worldly affairs.<br />This book was really an amazing, eye opening experience for me. But that was largely due to the fact I am an American.  But I would have given this book 5 stars, except the story is fairly flat, monotonous, and as I said above, somewhat unbelievable in it's extreme coldness.  It is a fact of human namure that even the most self possessed and domineering person on the planet will still have a number of soft spots for people and things in their lives.  The complete absence of any such tender humanity through long stretches of this book make it hard to swallow.	2001-04-30

And Krakauer is a good writer when he can stay focused on the story.  Unfortunately he pads this simple story way out of proportion.  It's a real insult to the reader.  He adds all kinds of quotes from high falutin sources to try and make the story take on trancendent meaning, and it's just gets in the way.  Also, he just assumes that everyone will fall in love with MacCandless, but that is hardly the case.  He seemed like a nice enough kid, but not nice enough to justify all the praise and attention heaped on him here.  If the people that MacCandless met on the road took a liking to him, then that means he was an outgoing, personable guy, not some kind of saint in training.  If MacCandless was so otherworldly and saintly then the facts could have spoken for themselves, instead of having to smash the reader in the face with the conclusion over and over again.  This story has all the poignancy of one of those evening news feel-good, &quot;kitten in a tree&quot; stories.  I think this book insults MacCandless's memory more than honors it.  I doubt MacCandless would have approved of this book if he had lived.	2001-04-25

The style was very choppy and inconsistent.  It seeemd like the author couldn't make up her mind what tone to take or who she imagined her readers to be.<br />The specific material itself was very meagre.  So the author used a lot of tricks to stretch it out and pad it.  There was a lot of half baked speculation.  A lot of &quot;perhaps this&quot; and &quot;this may be why&quot;.  In one paragraph alone I counted nearly 8 'may's.<br />The whole book was done in a sloppy and slipshod fashion.  Transparent attempts at pretending to be sympathetic towards Nash were very common.  This book was obviously just written to exploit Nash's Nobel notoriety.<br />The actual text is 388 pages.  But it could have easily been much shorter, probably around 220.  The padding with pointless speculations and extraneous material is obvious throughout.  The worst example of padding is the 35 page notes section.  The author heavily footnotes the text as if it were an article in a scholarly journal!  (Instead of the lurid supermaket tabloid style expose that it is.)  If any other biographer wanted Ms. Nasar's sources, they could conceivably contact her.  But to include these in a mass market paperback boggles the mind!<br />Anyway, this book does show that John Nash is a very interesting man.  It is a pity that a more competent and sympathetic biographer hasn't come forward to tell his story.  I would not recommend buying this book.  You would do better to check it out of a library and skim through it.	2001-04-16

And since there's very little feeling of respect for any sort of legacies from the past amongst software engineers, I doubt many modern day hackers give any credence to anything that is in here just because it is &quot;historical&quot; or &quot;traditional&quot;.<br />More importantly, software engineers as a breed have been shown to be amoral and power and money hungry.  Witness Bill Gates and all the rest.  There is very little that is &quot;cute&quot; or &quot;happy&quot; about such people, in my opinion.  In fact, I doubt your modern day hacker even bothers to make up cute little jargon anymore to amuse himself.  He doesn't need to, he can take a weekend and go snowboarding in the Alps, or indulge some other sybaritic taste.<br />The only value this book has is as a nostalgia piece for people who initially got into computers 25-30 years ago.	2001-03-08

Anyway, it rings false for me.  Virtually none of the brightness and magic that shines so sweetly in childhood is present here.<br />The great appeal of this book is, as I'm sure many have noted before me, schadenfreude, i.e., enjoyment obtained from the troubles of others.  The appeal is further compounded by the novelty of the contrast between the book's dreariness and all the sugar coated pap everyone gets fed to them by Hollywood and TV.  But that's just my guess.  And although I enjoy a good pratfall as much as the next guy, I'm not ghoulish enough to enjoy wading through 300 pages of it.  As for TV and Hollywood, people would find more nourishment for their souls all around them if they would just turn their backs on the entertainment industry.  Thanks for listening.	2001-03-08

Writing &quot;coolly&quot; about your life is a tough balancing act.  On the one hand, you make the stories quick and easy to disgest, but on the other, you surrender a lot of authority to tell your own story.<br />Overall, this is a little too close to Dave Barry or Erma Bombeck, but it's still well worth reading.	2001-02-28

This guy is a total blowhard and is completely in love with the sound of his own voice. He is a total master of the obvious, he states obvious things at great length over and over again with minor variations. It's hard to believe that he was involved in any meaningful way with any hi-tech success. I think it's more likely that he lucked into a situation that he fought hard to stay a part of, but he was never really a key player.

It's one long litany of misery, one crime, punishment or misfortune after another, sprinkled with the occasional half hearted attempts to explain the author's conflicted feelings about his life of crime and alienation.  You get no real feeling of the other people in his life, or of any of the color and joys in his life, as every life, even the most debased, must possess.  It's really a gothic kind of book, so if you enjoy tales of misery and subjugation and being a loner, then this is the book for you.<br />There is a long (34 page) afterword at the end of the book that gives a little more of a context on the author's life, citing some letters and things taken from during the later part of the author's life, after he had reformed.  This is nice, but it is sprinkled with some of the most ridiculously florid and extravagant praise for Jack Black, it's very jarring, almost sickening.  I know that the author of the afterword means well, but I really think he does Jack Black a disservice taking that sort of approach.  A simple, unvarnished presentation of the material would have been much better.<br />Anyway, it was a real chore reading this book, and I'm glad I'm done with it.  It's definitely not for everyone.  The stark plainness of the prose is a real effort to slog through.  But for those who are motivated, it does provide a rare glimpse into a different world.  There was a similar book published by Virago 15 years ago called &quot;Madelaine&quot;, written by an anonymous woman that described her life as a prostitute in the American and Canadian prairies in the last half of the 19th century.	2000-12-07

Mostly it is Rollins whining about how anguished he is about everything.  None of Rollins descriptions of his anguish are particulary cogent or compelling.  This book was a very self indulgent, narcissistic enterprise.  Sometimes narcissism is redeemed if the mind in question is worth regarding in the first place.  But that is not the case here.  Rollins has nothing to say other than his insistence that he was the right and the will to say it.  It's a lot like some musclebound pretty boy walking around the streets saying &quot;Now hear this&quot;, &quot;Now hear this&quot;, through a loud speak over and over again, but never saying anything else.  This is not completely fair, since Rollins does make attempts to describe and reason about his pain and anguish about his life, it's just that Rollins' powers of description and reasoning are very feeble and ineffectual.  He seems to know this, but he is comepletely without shame about it.  He even goes so far as to encourage other people with similar lack of abilities to follow his example.  He says in the &quot;afterword&quot;, or whatever (I'm quoting form memory): &quot;I am of average intelligence.  If I can do the things described in this book and write about them, then so can you.&quot;  (Note Rollin's manly and forthwright shunning of effete contractions, such as &quot;I'm&quot;.)

Even worse, the cartoonishness wasn't even particularly funny or pleasing.  In fact, much of it was extremely trite and facile.<br />The breathless comic book exaggeration with which everything is described gets tiring very quickly.<br />The only people who could enjoy this book, I imagine, would be people who desparately need an alternate comic book description of NYC in order to salve the years of misery they have had to endure dealing with the real thing.<br />There is no narrative, as such, just one more outlandish development piled on after another.<br />I came to this book with only mild expections, but even those were let down.<br />Another book that takes a similar story telling approach is &quot;Perfume&quot; by Peter Suskind, and that only succeeds for the first half of the book.  Sustaining an ominscient view magically-real narrative for even 200 pages is no simple matter.	2000-11-26

Ultimately unsatisfying, like eating a half dozen candy bars instead of supper.  The fact that it really happened doesn't seem to add much weight.  The author is telling about his life at such a remove, that it no longer seems to move him much, except to mirth.  There are some funny bits in this book, and that is the main reason to read it.<br />I'm a little disappointed by the packaging, as well.  This book has been padded with &quot;white space&quot;.  The print is large and there are double blank pages dividing each chapter.  This book could have been published as a novella at around 190 pages and at a much cheaper price, I suspect.	2000-11-21

I got bogged down in one of the many lavish discriptions of New Orleans banquet food, and gave up.

US	52310842	RDWQPPGV1KVA9	1930900007	979064135	David and the Phoenix	Books	5	2	2	N	N	beautiful book	Kind of an anacronism these days, I suppose, since it emphasizes the child's personal, solitary imagination and experience, whereas Harry Potter is very much about social and worldly egagement and participation.  Also, the way the Phoenix talks, it's easy to conjecture that it is a stand-in for a beloved and truly Grand, grandparent.  Children's books about grandparents being grand and magical are fairly rare these days in these youth culture oriented times.<br />I first read this when I was 12.  I got it out of the Library yesterday and re-visited it for the first time in 35 years.  It was a nice place to re-visit.  I don't have any grandchildren, but when I do, I hope I can pursuade my son to read them this for bedtimes.	2000-10-05

Even the worst hood has some sense of importance and  urgency to their lives. But Coyle and company are just presented here as  vermin under a microscope.<br />As for the vaunted accuracy of the dialogue, I  believe this book does fall down a bit. It shows that there is very little  variation between the club-tongued lower class dialect of Boston and  Brooklynese. As a lifelong resident of the Boston area, I believe this is  inaccurate. The only person I know of that has successfully captured the  Boston dialect in the media is John Ratzenberger playing the Cliff Clavin  character in the TV programm &quot;Cheers&quot;.	2000-09-13

Also, seems very dated,  rooted in the '50's.<br />Most of the stories are of the &quot;Twilight  Zone&quot;/&quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; form and structure. I.e.,  creepy setting, followed by twist ending. And this is more of a fantasy and  supernatural book than science fiction.<br />There is a lot of erudition on  display here, but it is the fussy, showy kind often displayed by the  autodidact. The pace and economy of some of the stories suffer because  unnecessary erudition is packed in with everything else.	2000-09-13

None of the characters in the book ever come alive. They are very wooden and cold and distant.<br />The author is also a painter, and painted the cover illustration (in, to my mind, very appropriately muddy browns) and did 5 cartoon illustrations inside the book. The author paints quite a few word pictures in the narative, as well, and very nicely too, for what that's worth. But the plot is rambling and episodic at best.<br />There's some self referential foolery sprinkled throughout which raises a couple guffaws, but don't really add anything to the book as a whole.<br />A lot of people say this is a Scottish novel, in particular, that much of it is located in and around Glasgow. But the local detail seems, like most of the detail in this book, to be irrelevant. The overall effect/impression is part rancid mustiness and part impudent narcissism, namely the author's. The author compares himself to Vonnegut at one point towards the end of the book, and I think it's a fair comparison. Unfortunately, I feel that Vonnegut is a total vacuous waste of time, too.<br />One telling detail from the book is about the paintings that the first incarnation of the lead character, Duncan Thaw/Lanark, paints. Everyone complains that the faces Thaw paints are always disturbing and twisted. But my reaction is \\"who cares?\\" The author obviously doesn't understand people, nor is he capable of empathizing with his readers, and therefore is unable to write an account that a reader can connect with.<br />I think the author should have stuck to the graphic arts.	2000-07-27

I'm an adult, but I like reading books for young adults. This book is very poorly plotted, is very uninvolving, and is generally written very sloppily. I had to give up  75 pages from the end, because it was so bogus. This author could not write  a credible action sequence to save his life. The hero of the story does  very little on her own behalf, takes very little initiative, very few  risks. She just rides along like a good little princess. This book is also  full of happy little patronising expository comments and lectures. It's  like an episode of The Magic Schoolbus from PBS. This book is a drag anyway  you slice it. If you want a good children's story adventure, read Robin  Jarvis. You can order Jarvis's books from amazon.co.uk.	2000-07-09

It is very hard to write about surreal  things because anything goes. It's hard to make it seem credible and  involving.

It has some very good writing and some very gripping sequences. But some of the sentences are stiff and obscure. And overall, the book did not flow. And the contrast between the ordinary world of the children and the fantastic  world they became enmeshed in was too stark and jarring. The various  aspects of the fantastic world are thrown pell mell at the reader with  little development or integration. The sequence where the children get lost  in the tunnels deep in the mountain is just so shatteringly hopeless as it  starts out, I never really recovered. The author is just so ridiculously  matter of fact about it.	1999-12-05

Futhermore, she is shown to be attacked, robbed, and fatally wounded by a group of street urchins while the hero looks on without acting to come to her aid. I found this to be very sickening.<br />The rest of the book is very smug and arrogant too, in my opinion.
