Greenblatt uses the plays combined with the snippets we know from the bard's past to create an astonishing biography.<br /><br />Greenblatt is an entertaining writer who clearly knows the plays inside and out. He has drawn from extensive analysis of the text to create a complex and thoroughly convincing picture of the great writer. This is a great book and should be read by anyone with more than a passing interest in Shakespeare.<br /><br />I was particualry impressed with his chapter on Macbeth which drew up on its links to the Gun powder plot and beyond. He places Shakespeare as a man of his time whode writing transcended it.	2005-05-06

It does not seek to bludgeon the reader with its views or bait the opposition. It seeks to understand the dominant political coalition in the most powerful nation on Earth. The central thrust is that the conservatives are now fully entrenched in power and the world needs to do more than chant slogans at them.<br /><br />Perhaps the best book on politics for the past 20 years - certainly essential to understanding the present state of the world.	2005-03-28

In Status Anxiety, he turns his atention to the dread that seems to inhabit successful societies.<br /><br />His look at the underpinnings of success is astonishing for its ability to make us rethink the way we live our life. The terms of success and failure are seen as almost meaningless. He argues strongly for redefining what we what to do and working to that end despite what anyone says.<br /><br />De Botton demonstrates enormous learning with a blaze of references and anecdotes throughout the book.<br /><br />An excellent thought provoking book from a writer who is at the top of his game.	2005-02-18

Menand manages to blend the lives of four very different people to tell a story of the development of a school of thought called pragmatism. Some of his writing is exceptional with digressions into the fascinating social history of the United States following the civil war. The way he manages to combine topics diverse as spiritualism, mathematics, document forgery and race relations into a single narrative is startling.<br /><br />The book opened up a fascinating period of intellectual ferment that gave rise to ideas that still influence the way the world thinks and acts.	2005-02-05

I think one of the reasons that Nixon invites so much controversy was that he was a complex and contradictory man. He just does not seem to fit. Watergate destroyed him, but you have conservatives railing against him and liberals saying he did good work and vice versa. Greenberg attempts an overview of all these competing images and it is surprising how often the image being projected says more about the writer than Nixon himself. A very interesting book that deserve patient study.	2004-02-08

Napoleon was a fantastic military leader, and great self promoter and opportunitst who led France and Europe into disaster.<br />Johnson puts forward a compelling case that Napoleon's memory should be scorned.

I would not call it a hatchet job, but I would not call it an accurate history either. Summers is obsessive with his footnotes, but it is the context of these anecdotes that seems awry.<br />Summers make no real attempt at balance and Nixon's achievements are sidelined in his rush for the dirt of his presidency. And there is plenty of dirt to be found. I preferred Kutler's dissection in War's of Watergate: The Last Crisis of Richard Nixon to Summers' extended tabloid newspaper-style trashing. I am no fan of Nixon, but I am an opponent of senstationalism dressing up as accurate history.<br />Bad, bad history.	2003-09-20

Attwood is intolerably bleak in her future and this is the central weakness of the book. There is no humour of fun - apart from sexual exploitation and drugs. If it is satire, it is satire of the blackest kind.

She may have been called the original obscure object of desire. Jay Gatsby hungers for a past where he was happy with Daisy. But is she is part of the  moneyed world  which is entered by crime or by inheritance. No one really earns it. Fitzgerald seems at odds with the American dream of wealth, but attracted to the glamour and excess of it.<br />The lack of  a moral compass in financial matters, can also be seen in the directionless lives of the novel's characters. Gatsby uses his fortune in an ill fated attempt to bring back Daisy. The narrator has empty affairs with people in his office. Daisy and Tom `smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money ... and let other people clean up the mess.' The author seems attracted to fame and fortune, and yet horrified by it. There is no moral centre in this universe.<br />A very sad novel that has haunted readers for almost 80 years.	2003-06-29

Professor White shows that both the Kennedy and the Khrushchev adminstrations, after fumbling at the start, were able to balance and sort out a very deadly game of nuclear chess. The recent film Thirteen Days shows the American side, but White expands to show the game being played in the Kremlin as well.<br />Professor White writes in a very lean manner and his conclusions are well grounded.

From that start, Orlean delves into the feverish world that is orchid collecting. Her focus is sometimes personal and sometimes historical. She shifts lenses and timeframes throuhgout the book.

For those who question the role history has in our lives I suggest you read this book and look at the world anew. Its focus is Churchill's fight against the appeasers in 1930s English politics. The staggering stupidity and the relentless badgering of Churchill as he stood his ground is an amazing story. Many people have described the Battle of Britain as Churchill's finest hour, but it was these long years with fascism growing in Europe that really mark him with distinction. Manchester is a brilliant historian and this is his masterwork. A dreadful pity that the third volume was never printed due his ill health.	2003-03-18

If you had not seen his television series, you might picture him as a hunched over academic scrouging through his books. No, he is a very energetic outdoorsy type with a real charm and flair for history.<br />I read this book after reading his work on the Trojan War and Alexander the Great. Both are fine books, particularly his amazing quest in the footsteps of Alexander. This work is a far better book, more detailed and more personal. He ranges over thousands of years of English history and enjoys bouncing ideas through time and space.<br />Wood is at his best when his describes the joy of old books and the historical treasure they contain.

I particularly like her ability to create a character in a few lines. Dr Tony Hill is once again matching wits with a deadly and dangerous opponent. A deeply flawed and anxious hero for the 21st century.<br />Murder is no parlour game in McDermid's universe and the killings are horrific. The suspense builds until you just cannot put down the book. Her driving narrative and ability to sweep you along are tremendous. I think the Tony Hill books are some of the finest of genre and McDermid can proudly stake her claim to be one of the top thriller writers in the world today.<br />That said, it is rather nice to go out to the garden and breath some fresh air when you have finished. McDermid creates a very nasty and black world. It occured to me that she owes a little to the gothic writers with their castles and torture chambers. And Hill is like a tortured knight bringing the evil killer to justice.	2003-02-10

Nonetheless, it does appears to be several stories loosely linked into a central narrative. Each of the stories is suberbly crafted and the writing is exceptional. But at times, I could not see the overall theme of the writer and where he thought it all fitted.<br />It is almost like several short stories mixed together and then placing the characters togther at the end of the war as they sort out their lives.<br />Despite this weakness, I loved the description of the desert and the trips through the wilderness. The love story is imaginatively told and the bomb decommissioning scenes are harrowing.	2003-01-29

I could not stop once I got going. The real strength is clash of characters that Val McDermid creates throughout the book. She can create a character in a few lines and then you feel as if you know them.<br />It has a strong narrative. The pressure builds as the book progresses, and you cannot stop reading. It is not really a who dunnit, but how on earth are they going to catch a serial killer mastermind.<br />I suspect McDermid has been influenced by Thomas Harris but she reworks the formula and avoids making her serial killer into a 'bogey man' like Hannibal Lecter. Lecter is a force and not a real being. The killer in Mermaids is a real person and the novel is more scary as a result.<br />An enormously enjoyable read as a clinical psychologist Tony Hill - who has his own problems - matches wits with a very sick and intelligent killer.	2003-01-29

The complaints ofthe Romans should very similar to today's tourists. I enjoyed the stories of his long suffering girl friend and their often hilarious adventures. The chapter on Capri is a great tale.<br />Having just completed the Italian leg of the journey, Perrottet is often spot on in his descriptions of Naples and Capri.<br />I like the way Perrottet blended in the stories of the present with travel stories of the past. A very intelligent and funny book that is highly enjoyable on every level.<br />As an Australian reader, I liked the way he linked the site of Gallopoli to the main narrative and showed that for all our civilisation, we have moved only a short distance from the Romans.	2002-12-14

But it is flawed on one count. Morris cannot deal with the social and political swirl around Roosevelt. We have no idea of the political forces with which he dealt. I think the very best biographies can see the individual against the backdrop of history - not as something apart from it.

Hanson argues that it has been political and social ideas of freedom and democracy that have given the West its edge in the military arena. He uses several well founded examples to support his case.<br />Hanson is most at home with the ancient Greeks and Roman history and his analysis of Salamis, Gaugamela and Cannae are highpoints of the book. The chapter on Tet is poor.<br />His overall thesis is that the west gains power basically through a commitment - sometimes a very loose commitment - to individual freedom which translates into better military technology and discipline on the battlefield.<br />The other chapters are all thought provoking and stimulating. While the book is provocative, it also repeats itself constantly and you find yourself tempted to move on.<br />The edition I read contained an analysis of September 11 attack, and in this case Hanson is far more clear in his thinking and analysis. Indeed, he is stronger at synthesis and draws some fascinating conclusions about western power from his research.	2002-10-22

Most readers of ancient history are aware of Cicero the writer, but his contribution did not stop there. He was deeply involved in the deadly game of politics during the Roman civil war that spelled the end of the republic. Everitt has produced a thorough examination of the life of Cicero.<br />I would have liked a more thorough explanation of the Roman political system. In this regard, the biography fails a little. We know what Cicero is doing but we do not understand the reasons for it and I would liked more depth in this book. Quite often, I felt the need to read other sources to understand the dynamics of Roman society and politics. Moreover, the footnoting is very scant and needs more rigour.<br />Overall Everitt presents the life of Cicero very well, but he does not do justice to the times.	2002-10-21

Locked in his room in an asylum with only his books, armed with his incredible mind and astonishing persistence, W.C.

Winchester is a superb storyteller and he even makes the forming of a dictionary an interesting tale. Mixing the tragedy with the remarkable achievement of W.C.

In recent years, Freud has been subject to endless ridicule and reassessment, but there is no doubt that his mind created a intellectual whirlwind that we are still living within. Think of our age's obsession with sex and you gain a glimmer of the impact of this man, who looked beneath the polite surface to the dark underpinnings. It is fascinating to read the life of the man who changed we think about ourselves forever.<br />In particular, I admired his scrupulous work habits and his intensity at task. Gay has written a daunting and impressive biography. I would have liked more information about the imapct of his ideas and the way they are received today, but then again that may have filled another book. Apart from that, I cannot fault the research that went into this book and the style with which it is written.	2002-06-23

I think the character Bendix is such a figure. Crying out to believe, wanting to believe, but unable to believe. I suspect we have the closest vision of Graham Greene himself in this work. It is a lament on the inability to believe in god. It is a masterpiece.	2002-06-17

In an age where race issues were beginning to divide the country, Ford used a broad brush western to show the dangers of hysterical racism. Ethan Edwards is the most complex hero, Ford ever produced and he defies analysis. After his efforts to reunite a family, he sees he has no place at all. Buscombe has written a very good and learned book on the searchers, but I still want more.	2002-06-14

In particular, they highlight the close to insane policies of the Russian Government as they sought to bolster the Cuban regime from US attack. This book gives the whole picture including the bay of pigs and other US misadventures that drove Castro into the Soviet orbit. The most fascinating section for me was the part on Castro and way he was compelled to adopt Soviet style communism. The US simply did not leave him any choice. A balanced look at high powered diplomacy that had gone mad.	2002-06-13

Watching three days of rain was the first time I went to the theatre unaware of anything about the play and then realising that I was watching one of the greatest plays ever written unfurl around me. The play is at times witty or sad or profound, but it is always real and Greenberg shows the links between the past and the future and the impossibility of knowing or understanding the forces that drove your parents. We get a picture of the parents and it is shaken apart in the second half. Three days of rain is a truely great piece of theatre.	2002-05-21

This is what Kirsch has managed to achieve in an excellent book that is superbly edited and written. W.H. Auden appears as a sensible and balanced critic of Shakespeare and his observations are always telling. I really like his chapter on Macbeth even though Auden claims that he has nothing to offer.

At first I was a little tentative about it and thought that it was too cute, but gradually I found myself sucked into the vortex of a Greek Island and an unspeakable crime against humanity. My advice is to stick with the book and you will find that the characters grow on you as their situation becomes more desperate. My only quibble is that the author did not seem sure how to finish the work, but it is only a quibble. Captain Corelli stands for humanity at a time of inhumanity.

Carville and Begala come to the same conclusions by a more indirect route. Beneath the jokes and the outright political bias, are two very clear minds giving very sound advice. The book is worth purchasing for their chapter on hard work alone. It advises no short cuts or get rich schemes. Success requires focus and commitment. The only thing that the authors skate over is a moral purpose. They clearly forgive Clinton for lapses, but they do not forgive politicians - of any side - for abandoning their moral beliefs. Hence I would have liked one more chapter on ethics, but I cannot deny the immense value and wisdom of this book.	2002-05-18

She was not 'an historian'. This book is a superb read from beginning to end and delights in telling a wonderful story of a very violent era. I am not sure that Tuchman actually proves her case that the 14th century was a distant mirror, but it is a fine piece of historical writing in any case. Even though Tuchman focuses on one slightly obsure nobleman, she manages to sweep across the history of the time and place with a relentless curiousity and drive.<br />I disagree with my tutor and I believe this is a fine book with some of the best historical prose in the English language.<br />As for the mirror, well it is a great title and gets you thinking, but I cannot see the link apart from the violence, which seemed to be present in every century.	2002-04-23

He seems to [pull] up information and to organise it into different patterns and perspectives. Every page has something of value. His previous book called the Work of Nations redefined the pitfalls and advantages of globalisation. In this book, which is pitched at a lower level, you sense the same divided attitude toward success. As an unashamed winner in the great global game, Reich has seen the benefits it can bestow a person, while ripping apart a person's life and their community.<br />I like the mixture of personal and global in his thinking. He comes at problems from many different angles. He shows how global forces penetrate everything and the impact on himself.<br />Unfortunately, like many analytical thinkers, Reich has no real solutions, but he has redefined the problems of a work-driven society on an individual and a global level. It is a starting point to help society move on.	2002-04-19

You find yourself moving from one chapter to another and it is no strain at all. Manchester was in top form with the history of America from the depths of the depression to watergate.<br />I particularly enjoyed the intertwining of social and political history. It creates a denseness to the period and you could see how the undercurrents moved from one generation to another. The hopelessness of the depression and then the blast of war that led to the conservatism of the 1950s and the protest period of the 1960s, and finally the backlash in the election of Nixon.<br />Manchester can write superbly and his energy never wavers. Without doubt, one of the greatest history books of this century.	2002-04-16

It is the work of a mind that cannot keep still and keep taking one step further on. Read it and I hope that it opens this exciting and daunting author to you as well. I was never the same after reading it and it has coloured all my thinking ever since. Read it and understand the Taliban, World War One and the Ku Klux Klan.

I see many similar themes in the rise of Milosevic. His use of ethnic hatred, the concentration camps and eventually the killings on a mass scale. Yet despite the mounting evidence, you can see from Halberstam's book, the extraordinary lengths that Europe and the United States went to in order not to do anything. Beginning with the toothless UN involvement through to the limited bombing of the Kosovo campaign. You get the impression that Milosevic was brought down by good luck rather than good management.<br />The sections on the invasions of Croatia and Bosnia and the stop start inaction of the allies was a harrowing read as the number of casualties rose.<br />Hallberstam is always interesting and throught provoking. To my mind, he clearly shows that the United States can never be insular again. It must engage in and be engaged in world events.<br />Also interesting is the strong link between domestic and international politics in the United States. Halberstam is able to show how every international relations issue has domestic impacts.<br />A very interesting book - both balanced and fair.	2002-04-05

Like all good narrative histories, it maintains a balance between the detail and the sweep of history. Any book that is fresh and alive after forty years, begins to deserve the title of classic. Unfortunately history does not stand still and many of Palmer's conclusions need to be tested. It needs to be read alongside Soboul and Schama to gain an understanding of the complexity of this period. Even so, a great work that will repay careful reading.<br />From this starting point, you can delve back into the influences that brought this group to power and forward to the Napoleonic period.	2002-03-30

Historians such as Albert Soboul have dominated thinking about the events of 1787 to 1795. Schama takes careful aim at these historians with a massive work, that looks at the chaotic underpinnings of the French Revolution.<br />Schama is a great writer and recreates the swirl of detail of the period. Nonethless, historians such as Soboul need to be read as well. Schama can get a little lost in the detail and the great contribution of Soboul has been to look at the underlying social changes that affected French Society during that period.<br />It would be a grave mistake to believe that Schama was in any sense definitive, but he has shattered the Jacobin-Marxist school's ownership of the French Revolution. Each reader will have to decide which about truth of each interpretation.	2002-03-30

I have read the whole book through and it is a superb narrative. This is no mean feat, for if you where to write a history of the United States from Columbus to the present, it would be close to a third of the time that he covers. You can start to see the relationship between the writers of the period and the politicians. You can begin to way each period is interlocked with the next.

Yet this biography is so strong, it can stand on its own. Nasar is an excellent writer who can create excellent pen pictures of life at RAND, MIT and Princeton. She shows great style in creating the environment of the late 1940s and the 1950s. Nash emerges as a complex, demanding and flawed person - an individual. Nash has since refuted the claims of anti-semitism and homosexuality in the book, but it is good to see that Nasar does not side step the issues at all. It is probably prudent to read Nash's comments on the book before making a judgement.<br />Where Nash is weak is in her descriptions of mathematical formulae. She does not appear to have any real understanding of the mathematics and I would have thought a plain English explanation of his work would have strengthened the biography. I got a little frustrated that she did not tackle this task. Yet it is perhaps a measure of Nash's genius that the ideas are so complex they cannot be easily reduced to a paragraph. Still she could have tried harded in this area. Nasar tends to get around this problem, by getting another expert to describe the brilliance of the idea, rather than the mathemtical idea itself.<br />Based on my own experiences with people with schizophrenia, Nash's recovery is remarkable and this is the section is probably the most interesting, perhaps because it is so startling. Even after reading the biogrpahy, I still find it hard to believe that someone could recover given the severity of the illness, so it gives some hope to people who suffer this disability and those close to them.<br />An absorbing biography and close to a great one.	2002-03-16

She is a writer with her own mind and this approach puts her out of step with nearly everyone in academia. Paglia  is a always readable and controversial. She has put a generation of  feminist's teeth on edge. And on occasion she gets distracted from the task  in hand to take a jab at her opponents.<br /> Yet this is a superb piece of  criticism taking in every apsect of the production of Hitchcock's  masterwork. Paglia is very good at the sexual and oedipal politics that  pervade Hitchock's work.<br /> It shows that film criticism needs not be dense  writing aimed solely at obscuring meaning.<br /> Her discussion on the  ending of the Birds certainly opened my eyes to a flaw of the film. As  great as the film is, the ending does not work. The original ending would  have provided a great climax to a masterwork, yet it was not chosen. Anyone  interested in the Birds or hitchcock should read this book.<br /> The book  covers a lot of ground and is immensely readable. The best of the series  which has shown good marketing sense, but really not a lot of good  criticism.	2000-07-22

Selecting battles and working out what keys could have turned when. Yet the author does not examine the implications fully. His account of Agincourt is  excellent, but in others he is on very weak ground. Can we really argue  that Hitler would have won the second world war if he didn't pause for  three days with his panzer divisions in France. Isn't it far more likely  that he was so self destructive that eventually a coalition would have been  formed to destroy him. Hitler invaded Russia when Britian was on its knees  and declared war on the United States for no real reason, wasn't that a key  factor. In a desperate war he spent massive resources in his insane quest  to eliminate the Jewish population. He also ignored the potential of the  'Jewish science' of nuclear phyisics. Hitler could not keep Italy in check  and it led to an absurd invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece which derailed  the invasion of Russia. Yes, chance plays a role in history but can it  change long term historical forces. A far better body of work on similar  topic is the British Televison Series Great Military Blunders which covers  the same terrain and makes a more sophisticated analysis. A good and fun  read but it really needed more rigour and analysis than provided here.	2000-07-11

For anyone interested in Hitler there is no better starting point. However, it is only a starting point,  Toland has no real ability at telling you why things happened. He cannot  get beneath the surface, but that is a small fault. The book needs better  footnoting and some of the references are weak, based on interviews that  cannot be followed, but overall it is a well-written and compelling account  of Hitler. It is certainly the most accessible biography of Hitler  available.	2000-07-09

This biography places his  achievements in context. Lincoln still emerges as a great man, but  tentative and complex. I would make it compulsory reading for every student  studying US history along with McPherson on the civil war.	2000-07-08

Bracher develops his arguments carefully and he helps create a picture of a society losing its grip and  inviting Hitler to destroy it.<br /> This book should be in print and should  be read by anyone who had even a passing interest in 20th Century History.	2000-07-08

Spoto is an ambitious writer who obviously enjoys his subject's films. His vision of Alfred Hitchcock as a tormented and sexually frustrated artist is not entirely convincing. Spoto piles on the anecdotes but cannot create a staisfactory synthesis of tormented genius.<br />Hitchcock eludes him as he has eluded most biographers. The central problem of Hitchcock was that he was an entertainer and no amount of intellectual analysis can deny this fact. His films were to be commercial successes and he aimed steadily at his market. Spoto focuses far too much on the sexual underpinnings of Hitchock's work and ignores the enormous fun of the films.<br />This book is a fair introduction to Hitchcock. Writers like Robin Wood,have gone further and better. Yet in the end, the sheer volume of his research will make this obligatory reading on Hitchcock. It will never be defintive.	2000-07-04

He would snub you as a peasant, but we delight in his approach to the Nazis as he hunts the biggest game of all - Hitler and then is hunted by the Nazis. The  final sequence in the pit is a delight. A superb book to be read and  enjoyed. Both versions of the film are excellent as well.	2000-07-02

It is a work that begins slowly and builds to a terrific climax. Carroll has written many fine horror tales and I think this is his  best. Not quite Ray Bradbury but very close.	2000-07-01
US	53057856	R507GM2CQC2ZV	0060929588	485442755	Napoleon Bonaparte: A Life	Books	2	14	20	N	Y	A poor vision of Napoleon	I opened Adam Schom's book with high hopes. A one volume biography of Napoleon that should at least give me the bones of his life and impact. But Schom is fundamentally a military historian and it shows in page after  page. He does not focus on the important legal and administrative changes  that Napoleon introduced throughout his reign. His rule meant that the  Aristorocracy could never hope to return to France in the way they ruled  before the revolution. Schom basically ignores the French Revolution and  its aftermath. He tells little of the social and political whirlpool that  led to Bonaparte taking power. His refusal to even acknowledge the  existence of the Code Napoleon is staggering and leaves this volume with a  great hole that no amount of love affairs and military campaigns can fill.  The correct title should have been a military biography, but little else. A  grave disappointment.	2000-07-01

He gives an excellent introduction to the Wilder classic Double Indemnity and gives a good background to the film.<br />Schickel could have done more and looked at the various interpretations of the film, but he is content to keep it focussed on its history.	2000-06-25

I think not. From a pure stratgic view, the British should  never have lost the war. The American people had decided that the British  were to be thrown out and thrown out they were. Bobrick is a conservative  historian and perhaps needs to look a little less at the figure heads and  more at social causes.<br /> But that is a quibble, Bobrick has written a  fine book which provides a sound introduction to the American war of  Independence.	2000-06-10

His two volumes on Churchill and the biography of MacArthur are excellent. This volume is well below his high standards, and he seems to flounder in trying to produce a  narrative to cover a huge spread of history. Unlike the tremendous Glory  and the Dream, he cannot weave his narrative magic over such as long  period.<br /> Manchester always writes well and this is no exception. The  critical problem is that he really offers no fresh insight. His  descriptions of Magellan's voyage are riveting and he seems to delight in  telling every gruesome detail of the middle ages.  For all the narrative  excellence, he does not get into the mind of an era.<br /> Also in some cases,  his selection of sources is dubious, particularly his section on the  Borgia's is based on some very shaky sources and his conclusions would be  hotly contested by many.<br /> This book can only be a good and colourful  general introduction to the period, but little more.	2000-06-10

It was not to be.<br /> Lukacs is very set in his ways and often passes off his views as fact. Toland is dismissed - even though his biography is a best seller - as being hard to read. A surprise for anyone who has read Toland's work.<br /> He then tries to link Toland with David Irving, even though they have nothing in common. He also points out that Toland has some bizarre views on Pearl Harbour, and says this indicates an authoritarian bent and that Toland admires Hitler, and so does the infamous Irving. I re-read Toland's work and I found it to be a well written biography of Hitler and I really cannot understand Lukacs' conclusion that he is an admirer.<br /> Fest's work - which he likes far more - is difficult to read and yet receives no such attack. The fact is that Lukacs does not like Toland's work and has thrown every bit of mud that he can at him.<br /> Further he basically ignores the work of Konrad Heiden before the war and the huge debt that Bullock had to the writer in his biography. Yet Bullock is praised for his efforts.<br /> Finally his virtual silence on Bracher is a real fault of the book. Bracher provides a far more cohesive argument for the rise of Hitler than Fest - in my opinion - and he is barely mentioned.<br /> Behind a facade of historical accuracy, Lukacs likes what he likes and is unfair to those he does not.	1999-01-19

Yet it is a disappointing book as Taylor seems to get lost in endless erudite arguments about Shakespeare. The book needs far more context than supplied here to explain to the reader what is occurring.<br /><br />The general problem with the reputational school is that hey seem to think that the debate caused by the work, is more important than the work itself. In the end, the quality of Shakespeare's writing and ideas are what continues to encourage study.<br /><br />I am not convinced by the central argument that Shakespeare's reputation is not fully deserved.	1998-11-14
