US	49106448	R3VF0MJXM5SW77	0743417127	613039611	Green Lantern: Hero's Quest (JLA (Pocket Star))	Books	4	11	15	N	N	Storyline contradictions notwithstanding, a solid read	Well, I was anxious to get this book... in 2003 when it was supposed to be released.  A lengthy couple of years and my enthusiasm turned slightly into dread that it would never come out.  Finally, it made it past whatever hurdles had so delayed it. <br /> <br />I confess that I was a fan of Green Lantern in my youth, and I am woefully ignorant of the current setting.  Thus, while some other reviewers have noted the severe divergences from the comic story, I cannot provide that (much like how some people love movies based on books when they haven't read them, but the people who have read the book are outraged at alterations -- I am typically among the latter by the way).  <br /> <br />The book does a fairly good job of telling the story of how a young man inexplicably and randomly ends up with a Green Lantern ring and the immense power it gives its wearer.  Kyle is a down and out artist with no confidence and no luck.  He gets the ring in a back alley after losing out on pursuing a girl, and life takes a big turn from there.   <br /> <br />He gradually learns how to use the ring somewhat subconsciously or from the ring itself, or so it would seem (the actual mechanism is a bit iffier but is explained).  He meets up with the Justice League and pretty quickly falls into their poor graces by being a typical flaky young man with personal concerns and no desire to be a hero.  When the Justice League disappears mysteriously, save for Kyle and Batman, Kyle is tasked with the quest to recover them.  What follows is some outlandish coincidences that affects the very nature of reality and all the beings living in it, which only Kyle and a couple alien helpers to save. <br /> <br />The characterization is good, and the book flies by.  I was left wanting a bit more, as Kyle essentially becomes a new man after his hero quest.  While this is not the best of the JLA books, it is a decent read, at least for those like me who have not kept up with the comics for over a decade.	2005-04-26
US	49106448	R1O8AZZ93KR98O	0756402816	740922398	Renaissance Faire	Books	4	30	30	N	N	Some good, some not so much	This anthology gives a number of stories set at Renaissance Faires in various parts of the country.  All make use of some fantastic encounters or occurrences to tell their stories. <br /> <br />\\"Jewels Beyond Price\\" by Elizabeth Ann Scarborough is a fine story, though it is a bit slow.  Nothing like a genie to make life interesting. <br /> <br />\\"Diminished Chord\\" by Joe Haldeman does not actually take place at a Fair, but it does make use of fantasy.  A musician has a magical encounter with a mysterious woman and acquires something that allows him to become successful later.  The closest to a Fair is a musical performance among other players of antiquated instruments at a gathering at a home. <br /> <br />\\"Splinter\\" by Kevin J. Anderson and Rebecca Moesta is a nice lesson-story that brings in some historical personages and religious artifacts to educate a misguided young man. <br /> <br />\\"Girolamo and Mistress Willendorf\\" by John Maddox Roberts is a really nice story about an eternal conflict.  It brings in classic religious items and something of the battle of the sexes. <br /> <br />\\"A Time for Steel\\" by Robert E. Vardeman is a nice little Arthurian story set in a modern Fair.  I enjoyed this one. <br /> <br />\\"One Hot Day\\" by Stephen Gabriel is one of the stories in the anthology that links an attendee of a Fair to the past by some mystical means.  The buildup was good, but the end was a bit sudden.  The resolution itself, though, we nicely done. <br /> <br />\\"Wimpin' Wady\\" by Jayge Carr is something of a lesser part of this book.  This one deals with faeries and changelings and parental authority and how children of any race can be precocious.   <br /> <br />\\"Brewed Fortune\\" by Michael Stackpole is one of the really good stories in this book.  Using characters from a past story, he uses a Renaissance Fair setting to tell a story about the assistant to an investigator that ties into the ancestry of that assistant's past.  Really well done. <br /> <br />\\"Marriage A La Modred\\" by Esthner Friesner was another lesser story in the book.  A young man inadvertently gets his sister into trouble with a fantastic Fair-attendee, leading him to a noble decision to save her.  The ending is lame, and most of the dialogue and developments nothing to write home about.  Not her best work. <br /> <br />\\"A Dance of Seven Vales\\" by Rose Wolf is another so-so story.  This one has magical and mystical doings aiding preservation of the environment, and the many creatures that live therein. <br /> <br />\\"Moses' Miracles\\" by Roberta Gellis is a really nice story.  A collector of rare manuscripts and his assistant make an interesting acquiantance at a Fair.  Linking ancient religion and New World civilizations in a satisfying way, Gellis delivers one of the better stories in this book. <br /> <br />\\"Grok\\" by Donald J. Bingle is a bit sad, telling the story of a forgotten man whose only life takes place at the annual Fair. <br /> <br />\\"Renaissance Fear\\" by Stephen D. Sullivan is another lesson-story, and another time-travel story.  While it is at least not as touchy-feely as most of the stories in this collection, the overriding lesson of being honest is not as valuable.   <br /> <br />\\"The Land of the Awful Shadow\\" by Brian A. Hopkins is another great one in this collection.  The trials and tribulations of youth are the focus here, especially as they relate to alternate realities and people able to perceive them. <br /> <br />\\"Faire Likeness\\" by the recently-departed Andre Norton is a typical great work from her.  A wonderfully gifted artist and the magic he wields to produce his works is the focal point.  The same great characterization and viewpoint that she could write is evident in this one. <br /> <br />Overall, the few really good stories make this collection a good buy, but there are a few in here that were certainly not to my liking.	2005-04-20
US	49106448	R3S4DDIX2A4P7V	0786933941	978348793	Realms of the Dragons: The Year of Rogue Dragons (Forgotten Realms Anthology)	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A decent anthology	Providing a selection of stories from a range of eras in the Forgotten Realms history and present, this anthology's stories all involve dragons in some fashion. <br /> <br />While his is usually the best among Forgotten Realms anthologies, Salvatore's \\"Wickless in the Nether\\" is not really anything to rave about.  This is another Artemis Entreri and Jarlaxle story, this time having them being manipulated by dragons.  The story really does not go anywhere, though it might tie into the next novel involving them.  This one just did not do it for me, though it was the reason I bought the book. <br /> <br />\\"Soulbound\\" gives us a story of a Shadow Dragon and its dealings with some clerics of Shadow.  The ending was disappointing, though there might be a sequel at some point, or so I hope. <br /> <br />\\"First Flight\\" by Edward Bolme is a great read.  This one has a wizard of Netheril investigating some mysterious happenings, and being caught up in some deific meddling. <br /> <br />Cunningham's \\"Gorlist's Dragon\\" was so-so, telling the tale of a drow in Ched Nasad.  This is something of a coming-of-age tale, and was worth the read. <br /> <br />Greenwood's \\"Keeper of Secrets\\" was also a so-so read.  This is a story set in Waterdeep, with some familiar characters.  Mirt the Moneylender contacts a mysterious figure of rumor in his attempt to solve the murder of one of those in debt to him. <br /> <br />\\"The Topaz Dragon\\" by Lebow was a nice story.  This one has a dragon trying to use those who would steal her egg to her own ends. <br /> <br />\\"Serpestrillvyth\\" by Richard Baker was a really nice story.  While many others have nice touchy-feely resolutions, this one certainly does not.  It deals with a band of adventurers in their mission to save a town from the depredations of an evil dragon. <br /> <br />\\"Waylaid\\" is a good read, brought to us by Thomas Reid.  It has a half-elf snared by a white dragon and coerced into doing its bidding. <br /> <br />\\"Standard Delving Procedure\\" by Smedman started out very promising, though the ending was somewhat abrupt and only partially satisfying.  I liked it overall though, with an older dwarf trying to mentor a younger impetuous one. <br /> <br />\\"An Icy Heart\\" provides a nice story about Dragon Turtles and their attempts to deal with the Rage, the malady that is making dragons go crazy. <br /> <br />\\"Penitential Rites\\" by Strohm is a murder mystery that was really not that tough to solve.  I did not get much from this tale of a half-dragon trying to repent for his past misdeeds. <br /> <br />Dave Gross's \\"How Sharper Than a Serpent's Tooth\\" is a truly great story.  This one has a theater troupe writing and performing a play as a special commission.  The characterization and plot development, as well as the details of the day-to-day theater life.  This and Byers' story are the two best in the book. <br /> <br />\\"Beer with a Fat Dragon\\" is another so-so story.  This one has characters from the Forgotten Realms' Far East dealing with a dragon legend from that region. <br /> <br />Richard Lee Byers' \\"The Prisoner of Hulburg\\" is another great story.  Evil Zhents, archeological delvings, thieves, psionics, clerics, demons, and fighting, all good stuff.  Definitely a page turner. <br /> <br />While most of the stories are so-so, the writing itself is generally good.  The two stories by Byers and Gross alone make this collection worth picking up.	2005-03-25
US	49106448	R2A5CXCQ1JDOEX	0451453786	677702999	Battletech 15: Close Quarters (Bk. 15)	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Great characterization and interpretation	Milan in _Close Quarters_ gives perhaps the first best characterization of those people living in the Battletech era.  The similes and metaphors are totally in-character to the setting, not relying upon contemporary comparisons to make the reader understand.  However, while this might normally prevent a reader unfamiliar with the setting and some of the major characters, I think that the preentation is such that even a newcomer could understand without trouble. <br /> <br />My beef is with the characters.  The main character is entirely too superhuman in her abilities.  Not only is she the best scout and tactician of the regiment, she is also the best hand-to-hand fighter and the fastest runner and everything else.  Her only flaw is a lack of emotion, which is the only aspect of her character that might be considered to change during the course of the novel.  She becomes friends with people she normally would not, but her growth I feel is very limited.  Also, the other characters are either two-dimensional or cliches, like the unit commander grief-stricken over a family-member's death and unable to function to the commander's son desperate to earn pop's approval.  Those elements reduce the quality of the overall work.  There is the standard combat scenes which are not as good as others in the Battletech series.  Also, the story does not really seem to impact the big picture, just those involved directly in the story.  In that respect this is not really a \\"core\\" novel in the series and is not terribly essential to the overall comprehension.  However, as noted above, the perspective of the characters and setting in this might be the best to this point in the series.	2005-01-11
US	49106448	REUTT15SXV2R4	0743475208	499678654	Wild Cards (v. 1)	Books	4	10	12	N	N	A truly great collection of connected stories	Martin provided in Wilds Cards a new universe for writers to explore superheroes.  The assemblage of authors in this first collection of stories set in his Wild Card universe is truly great. <br /> <br />The first story creates the setting, as an alien virus is released into the air above New York City despite the best efforts of a WWII ace hero.  This is the jumping off point for the subsequent stories, which advance the story forward in time successively. <br /> <br />Zelazny's story is the prize of this collection, creating an Ace (a person afflicted by the alien virus and receiving powers instead of deformation, while those deformed are Jokers) who reappears and is mentioned in the later stories.  A little boy is forced into adulthood, and the conclusion really hits home. <br /> <br />Other stories detail Aces with powers of different sorts.  Some have their powers dormant only to be activated by chance, while others work to develop their powers to become like their comic book heroes of youth.  Some are criminals, some are just regular people who have to deal with the card that fate drew for them. <br /> <br />There are several interludes that take the form of news excerpts through the years, to rationalize the events of the day or explain in scientific terms the nature of the powers that Aces demonstrate.  There are a couple stories that I feel are only so-so, which kept this review from a fifth star, but I have obtained the second collection eagerly to read more.	2005-01-11
US	49106448	RPJNQ90E99G92	0451459512	938448810	Battletech: The Classic Era: The Legend of the Jade Phoenix Trilogy	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Excellent glimpse into the Clan warrior lifestyle	Wow.  I am actually angry at myself for not having read this trilogy when it came out more than ten years ago.  The tale of Aidan Pryde is truly one of the best in the Battletech series. <br /> <br />The trilogy edition is a nice product, with a new flashy cover.  Interstingly, the separate novels maintain their own page numbers, unlike some other novel compilations I have read, so each one has its old title page and starts on page 1.  I liked that. <br /> <br />The first novel takes us through the Warrior training regimen in Clan Jade Falcon.  The lifestyle of the trainees and the established warriors is very well done.  The competition between the siblings and their relationships is great reading.  The eventual result of the training, and the application of non-standard tactics makes this one a page turner, especially with the atypical path events take. <br /> <br />The second novel deals with the warrior life of Aidan, in his assumed guise of a different person.  The lower status of this other has led him to low-prestige assignments, but a rare opportunity to show his abilities, despite his differences with higher-ranking officers, affords him a rare opportunity to fight for a Bloodname.  But the path to that status is anything but easy.  This novel has a great deal more mech combat than Way of the Clans had, but it does not detract from the story. <br /> <br />The third novel takes place at a later point in Aidan's life, after he has served for some time as a Bloodnamed warrior.  He has been assigned to command the rebuilt disgraced Jade Falcon unit which was lost in the Clan invasion of the Inner Sphere, primarily because he himself was looked down upon as a disgraced warrior due to his colored past.  His unit is to be among those fighting ComStar on Tukayyid.  The fate of this battle was detailed in a prior novel, but not from the Clan point of view, and not in the singular detail that this one provides.  The exhibition of battlefield acumen staves off certaindefeat, but it is a pyrrhic victory at best.  Again, the quixotic nature of Clan interpersonal relationships is delved into, but in a different way than the earlier novels.  Again, a great read and a real page-turner.	2004-12-02

While the author's plotting and characterization have vastly improved, and the hither and thither storyline is reduced essentially to a single story arc, the actual events in the story are extremely atypical per what one would expect in the Battletech universe. <br /> <br />The Black Thorns, having won their battle with Clan defenders in Main Event, are contracted by the Draconis Combine to fight more Clan warriors.  This time they are to be sent behind Clan lines on a raid against a soon-to-be-completed factory. <br /> <br />There is an overriding storyline with the protagonist and his relationship to the DropShip captain.  However, this is presented mostly as a back-of-the-mind concern, having little effect on the character himself.  Rather than being changed by the circumstances, he pretty much proceeds as usual, showing him to be a flat character in my opinion. <br /> <br />The battle follows pretty standard lines, with the Black Thorns being outnumbered and outclassed, but faring well due to their training and the relatively low caliber of their opposition.  The climactic battle in the story is pretty anticlimactic in its resolution.  I was disappointed in it, as it hinged more upon trickery than skill. <br /> <br />Overall, an OK book, not the worst in the BT series, but far from the best.  It was an improvement over Main Event, but the lack of a third novel leaves us all hanging as to the fate of the unit.	2004-12-02

The main character starts out with nothing, and attempts to recruit his former neighbors and family members to his cause.  The rejection leads him to Solaris VII, where he must fight to gain the materiel he needs for his personal vendetta.  He is there but a few days before leaving for Outreach to find a contract for his new merc unit, and to recruit more personnel.  Everything works out relatively neat and tidy.  It just does not read like a good novel, with the convenience of events and the results.   <br /> <br />Also, given the back cover text, I had expected more along the lines of a Solaris-set novel, but the story stays on that world for a comparatively short time.  Much more time is spent on the world that the unit is contracted to defend.  And the antagonism there again reads like something from a poorly-designed RPG campaign, with the local strife resulting in an action by that planet's leaders unlike any other in the Battletech universe.  The story climaxes with combat against Clan invaders, with the occasional pointless death thrown in, I assume to highlight the random savagery of war, but seemingly tacked on as an afterthought. <br /> <br />I was really disappointed in this novel.  Note, however, that the sequel is vastly superior and very much worth the read, while this one is sure to languish on my shelf without getting a second read.	2004-12-02
US	49106448	RVWD3PBNR5AVU	1844161129	45409039	Traitor General (Gaunt's Ghosts)	Books	4	15	16	N	Y	An interesting chapter in the Ghosts storyline...	Dan Abnett again provides a wonderful page-turner of a novel in the Gaunt's Ghosts' storyline.  The prologue sets the stage quite well, as the commanding officers of the Ghosts are not present at a function they normally would attend, replaced instead by other familiar faces. <br /> <br />The leadership along with a select squad of some of the most able of the Ghosts has been tasked with a very important and secret mission.  They have journeyed to a Chaos-held world to seek their quarry, whose identity is kept secret for most of the book but should be known to readers of an earlier book in the series. <br /> <br />The Ghosts are forced to trust people they normally would not, and they are forced to go places and face foes that others would almost certainly avoid.  Not only must they face the Chaos forces, they must deal with the insinuation into their very beings of the essence of Chaos.  Unity begins to wear among the group as they near their quarry, and the reader must worry whether they will destroy themselves in internecine conflict. <br /> <br />As with the other Ghosts novels, the characters are very well-developed, but it is through the Chaos effects that we see somethings that were only hinted at before.  There are of course a number of battles, but not terribly gruesome as some of the earlier books.  The body count, perhaps due to the small size of the infiltrating force, is lower than most of the preceding books.  The ending, however, is something of a punch in the gut, despite not being entirely unexpected.  More great WH40k action, though, at its best.	2004-10-28

Rather, more avenues are opened up and not addressed.   <br /> <br />Drizzt and Innovindil continue their efforts to fight the orc legions, with Drizzt and Obould the orc-king finally meeting in combat.  However, Salvatore changes gears slightly and makes this enemy beyond Drizzt's normal abilities.  Salvatore does, however, make no secret of getting to Drizzt the tools needed for the job.  While the battles show some of Salvatore's old flair, the inability of Drizzt the Invincible to defeat this blessed orc grates against me, especially given the inner rage Drizzt feels for this orc having killed (so Drizzt believes) his closest companions. <br /> <br />The nonexistent love quadrangle between Catti-Brie, Wulfgar, Drizzt and Delly Curtie is played too far, as well as some cliched use of a newly-childless mother in her grief, to move this story along.  It almost seemed like the cast might have been too large, and some of the chaff needed to be separated from the grain.  Suffice to say that a number of consistent supporting characters do not survive this book intact, though the primary players of the Drizzt series come through for the most part.  There is also still some notable lack of appreciation from the Nesmeans despite the efforts of those from Mithral Hall to aid them, selflessly. <br /> <br />The end of this novel, though, leaves nothing finished.  A new quest is planned, Wulfgar must travel down the river to seek a lost child, Catti-brie and Drizzt finally get to business, the orcs are still holding sway over the northland and the surface region of Mithral Hall, the humans are surprisingly willing to let the orcs stay put and dig in, there is new cooperation among Dwarven nations, and there is still strife between the frost giants and the orcs.  But most of that was true at the end of the second book.  While the writing of this storywas fine, and perhaps the best in this trilogy, the necessity of flipping back and forth between so many disparate storylines seemed to give short shrift to them all.  Yes there are clever and well-written fight scenes.  Yes, there is sword and sorcery goodness.  Yes there is stupidity and sacrifice.  But there is no resolution.  I think that loyal readers would not have minded wrapping up some of the many loose ends before starting a new series, we still would be willing to buy it.  But leaving so much hanging, for a year at least, is really beneath a good author, in my opinion.	2004-10-24
US	49106448	R154ZHOD3IL6WX	0743488385	707202787	Visions of Liberty	Books	4	12	12	N	Y	A very nice anthology of sf stories	The stories collected in this book all center in some way around a central concept of society in the absence of official government.  In nearly all cases, the inertia of societal mores leads to a moral and just society, despite a lack of officialdom to enforce laws, of which there are none.   <br /> <br />Lloyd Biggle, Jr.'s \\"The Unnullified World\\" showcases the difficulties encountered by an interstellar investigator trying to track a murderer on a planet lacking a government.  The majority of characters are involved with mining, either the actual process or among the ranks of the corporations which fund them.  The manner in which the population deals with the killer is somewhat interesting.   <br /> <br />\\"The Right's Tough\\" by Robert Sawyer shows what happens when relativity plays a part in people's perspectives.  A long-absent team of space explorere returns to an Earth centuries after leaving it, to find that government no longer exists.  Every person is connected from childhood to a central computer which tracks the manner in which they interact with others, alerting people, for example, when a pickpocket grows near.  The problems these astronauts encounter seem very much not in character with those who should hold such heroic posts, in my mind, with an unsatisfying conclusion to a good story concept. <br /> <br />Mike Resnick and Tobias Buckell's \\"The Shackles of Freedom\\" shows what a future Amish community located on another planet might be like, through the eyes of a modern-trained physician working among them.  His knowledge and capabilities are hampered by the locals' beliefs, forcing him to rely upon ancient methods only.  This story is very well-done, I thought, and I liked it a lot.  Good inner conflict of the protagonist. <br /> <br />Brad Linaweaver's \\"A Reception at the Anarchist Embassy\\" is a strange story about troubles on a government-free world trying to resist influence from the United Planets.  I was not terrbly impressed with this story, as it seemed to me to be intended primarily to deliver the closing line.  The story itself seemed less than the others in the collection. <br /> <br />Michael Stackpole's \\"According to Their Need\\" is the newest in his Purgatory Station series, even though it does not occur on the station.  The main character of this series of stories is visiting a friend on a retirement planet which is free of officials.  There are strenuous requirements to become a citizen, even for a short time, which have been violated.  The friend was formerly a police investigator, and she must reassume that mantle to solve a murder and disappearance as there is no parallel on the world.  There is something of a cheat, I thought, near the end that Stackpole does not usually resort to, but I thought that most of the story was a good one. <br /> <br />Jane Lindskold's \\"Pakeha\\" takes place on New Zealand, after the cessation of government throughout most of the world after a severe technological regression.  An immigrant who previously relied upon brawn and might must attempt to integrate himself into a community of give and take, but he is reluctant to give despite expecting others to do so.  I thought the story started well and slowed down, and the end was not unexpected, but I liked the story a good deal overall. <br /> <br />\\"Devil's Star\\" by Jack Williamson has a new member of the Terran Republic military thrust into a strange circumstance of infiltrating a world with whom contact was lost.  This ex-prison planet has been left alone for quite some time and has developed the technology to visit space again.  The young agent is sent to discover the making of this society and how the Terrans might reassert their control over it.  Things get hairy when he falls in love with a native girl and decides that he prefers the non-authoritarian rule of the world to that of Terra.  This was another good story from the Grandmaster. <br /> <br />Mark Tier's \\"Renegade\\" shows us what life in the US might be likeafter the fall of the government and the change of the US military to a large mercenary organization.  A murderer has escaped the bounds of being tracked by severing all ties to insurance agencies, who want him caught to pay up for killing their client.  The story is told from the perspective of an insurance investigator who is in pursuit of the murderer.  This is a great and fun story by the co-editor of the book. <br /> <br />\\"The COlonizing of Tharle\\" by James Hogan is another story about a planet that is being re-contacted by Terran authorities.  Society here has taken a strange turn, as people try to keep the economy balanced personally, not so much globally, buy upping prices to what they can afford while merchants try to reduce prices to as little as they need.  A young officer from the Terran ship falls for a local girl and decides he likes their society better.  Not a bad story, but on the heels of Williamson's it seemed a bit like a re-run. <br /> <br />Overall, while there are some typos and grammar errors and the like in this book, I liked it a lot and would not hesitate to recommend it to someone who enjoys reading sf short stories.	2004-10-14
US	49106448	R3GKQLREBUX83L	0743417151	380461451	Exterminators (JLA (Pocket Star))	Books	5	16	17	N	N	An excellent novel	Christpoher Golden really knows how to write.  Either that, or his editors are geniuses, for this book was truly a page turner. <br /> <br />A huge crop of new metahumans has appeared suddenly, and nearly all are linked to England.  As one might expect, some try to use their power for good, some for evil, and some are simply whack-jobs.  The situation grows much worse, though, when all the new metahumans begin to mutate into monsters. <br /> <br />This mutation, however, is the clue that the Justice League needs to solve the mystery.  There is a definite tie between the new mutations and a mysterious foe that the League fought in their earliest days.   <br /> <br />This book highlights the main JLA members: Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter, Flash, and Green Lantern;  but there is also a large number of cameos by other heroes, including the Justice Society and many reserve JLA members.  I was glad to see Firestorm again, even if only briefly.  Some others who appear are Blue Beetle, Booster Gold, Atom, Captain Atom, Steel, Nightwing (and mention of the rest of the Titans), and Captain Marvel.  But these characters are not mere window-dressing, at least not universally, as we are given insights to their thoughts and views as well.  This was a very nice addition, and one that could easily have been skipped, but these inclusions really made the supporting cast (despite a limited role and scope) a contributing element to the story. <br /> <br />Golden does a great job of taking the characters from the visual comic environment into the novel.  The POV focuses on a single character at a time, but we are given insight into that character's views of the others in the JLA (and the current crisis) and how they feel about the past.  Rather than a simple book of fights, there is a good undercurrent to the book, and effort was made to show some character evolution.  I was very much impressed with the quality of the book, what I consider a faithful adherence to the fundamentals of the characters as they appear in the comics, along with a solid story in which to place them.  Golden has, as with his Marvel novels, really set a high bar for others to follow.  This is the best JLA book yet.	2004-09-15

This ring becomes the pivotal part of the story, as it turns the boy into a new Sinestro. <br /> <br />There is a scene that takes place in 1972 (though the book gives 1992 in the heading, which is a missed typo, and later the characters refer to 1971) with Hal Jordan, Green Arrow and Black Canary fighting Sinestro and defeating him handily.  This passage really seems pointless to me, as it might have been a factor later in the book, but seemed not to be.  Perhaps this will be relevant in the sequel(s).  There is also an inconsitency in one part of this scene when Green Arrow gives his bow to Canary, but then still has his bow...? <br /> <br />Hmm, anyway, we move to the present day and get tons of Kyle Raynor agonizing over his personal life, while his girlfriend Jade keeps turning away his offer to commit for real.  This really reads like high school claptrap, but it is at least somewhat well-done.  This relationship issue ends up leading to the abduction of Jade by Sinestro, with whom she was kinda messing around.  So GL has to follow, he gets in trouble, they have to work together to get free, somewhat typical plot development.   <br /> <br />There are cameos by Plasticman, Hal Jordan as the Spector, Superman, and the old golden age Green Lantern, Jade's father.  Only Spector really seems important to the story, though he does not do much more than change something here, influence something there.  We get a lot of angst in his inner thoughts as well.  Not too badly done, though. <br /> <br />The resolution is rather abrupt, though it did not really leave anything hanging, which I appreciated.  Too many first parts of trilogies leave things obviously open, which vexes me.  However, the writing style of this novel was not great to me.  Nearly every paragraph relies uponsimile and metaphor to explain things, and the references are so contemporary that the book may be unreadable 10-20 years from now.  It really got old fast.  Also, there was a fretfully large population of typos and word mixups, like \\"the\\" for \\"they\\" and \\"breath\\" for \\"breathe.\\"  I think that a word processing spell check was used, but that a thorough proofread was not performed.   <br /> <br />However, the story was not terrible, though it was not a very long book to pay hardcover price for.  That, combined with the poor quality control, leads me to recommend that people wait for the paperback version of this one.	2004-08-08
US	49106448	R1QU5LPS1QJKFY	1844160890	537951728	Double Eagle (A Warhammer 40,000 Novel)	Books	5	27	28	N	Y	Abnett's expertise extends to the air	Double Eagle sees the focus put on the pilots of the Imperium, specifically a group of fighter- and bomber-pilots who were first seen in one of the Gaunt's Ghosts novels.  As per usual, Abnett has superior character development.  This book, as with all his others, is truly a page-turner. <br /> <br />Something of an aside to the Ghosts storyline, this novel takes place on a planet suffering from a Chaos invasion in the Sabbat Campaign that Abnett has written so much about.  (In fact, there are some references to the Ghosts storyline, but not so that the reader is left confused.)  As with Abnett's other works, we see comparatively little of the enemy in terms of internal thoughts, only getting that before they interact with the heroes.  There is only one such villain, actually, an ace of aces who seems unstoppable.  He makes several appearances, always defeating those he faces, or driving them to extreme measures to flee. <br /> <br />One of the primary characters is the flight commander of the Phantine XX fighter wing.  She is a great character, mixing in-combat skill with concern for her wingmates.  Others in the unit also provide great characters, the old nice guy, the new kid trying to prove himself.  The planes are also like characters, given their jinxes and idiosyncrasies.  The unit really is a whole, from machine, to tech, to pilots. <br /> <br />Another arc of the story deals with a bomber pilot who is in another unit.  He was saved by one of the Ghosts in another novel, and feels he is on borrowed time, that he should be dead.  He meets a woman who has lost pretty well everything, and they find in each other that which they were missing.  This is really my favorite part of the book.  The human side. <br /> <br />There is a great deal of air combat, which Abnett delivers with exquisite skill.  I could feel all the losses and exult in the victories as though I were there.  There are a number of close calls, tight squeezes, near-misses.  All those things thatmake such situations interesting to read.   <br /> <br />This novel shows again that Abnett is the best of the WH40k authors, at least in my opinion.  Despite the lack of a well-determined enemy, this book is a great read.  After all, the reader is supposed to feel for the Imperium, not those who hate all life.  In that respect, the lack of depth in the enemy is perfect.  However, as has been occurring more and more of late in new release books, there were a number of typos.  Not the British-American differences in certain words, which I have grown accustomed to through Abnett and the rest, but simple lack of proofreading, I believe.  The story was so great, though, that I overlooked that entirely in my rating.	2004-08-08
US	49106448	R2FDQ4IT4UV0O1	1844160777	654358799	What Price Victory (Warhammer 40,000)	Books	3	15	15	N	N	Only so-so, a far cry from some of the other 40k anthologies	The first story in this antho is \\"Thorn Wishes Talon\\" by Dan Abnett.  This is something of a prequel for Abnett's _Ravenor_ Warhammer 40k novel.  Those who have read Abnett's Eisenhorn trilogy or short stories might recognize the title as a prhase used often by characters in those works.  We have a cast of characters not totally unfamiliar, though the new additions are not fleshed out as well as one might hope.  Still, this story seems to work as a bridge between the Eisenhorn trilogy and the _Ravenor_ novel, as I mentioned, as something of a passing of the torch.  It is OK, and really lends a better view to the events in that novel.<br />Next up is Mitchel Scanlon's \\"Forever Loyal.\\"  In this story we have a records clerk from an imperial world attempting to acquire some relics or riches in order to escape his dreary life.  This story is OK, but I rarely appreciate stories that go nowhere for the sake of a specific ending as this one seemed to be.  There is no character development, but simply a lot of suffering (on the characters' parts, as well as the reader's) leading...  well, nowhere.<br />Simon Spurrier's \\"Elucidium\\" is a mammoth of a story, over 90 pages in length.  This one deals with a less well-written race in the WH40k universe, at least in terms of depth.  Often we see genestealers simply as enemies.  In this case, we have a story from the point of view of one of their mutated descendants, one who lacks the unadulterated savagery of the pure genestealers.  The reader sees something of the culture of the genestealers and their motivations.  There are a number of twists and turns, which are only acceptable in that the point of view is limited in nature.  The ending is good, though the story relies upon the ends justifying the means, as one character must eliminate people on his own side simply because he disliikes their specific methods.  <br />Darius Hinks' \\"Calculus Logi\\" is not so great.  I was into it initially, as there was good story advancement.  The resolution, however, was a disappointment.  A servitor and several non-augmented human prisoners are the survivors of a crashed ship.  They are trapped in a cave by the local environment and wildlife, forced to make repeated deadly voyages in order to survive.  The party gets whittled down, and betrayal becomes the order of the day.  That much is fine, but some of the events that immediately preceed the conclusion seem poorly designed.  <br />\\"Crimson Night\\" by James Swallow is one of the better efforts in this collection.  A Space Marine unit arrives to take over a planetary garrison from a vicious fellow Space Marine unit.  The two units are almost immediately at each others' throats, as their philosophies are somewhat opposed.  There is also some unsavory legendry associated with the relieved unit, and some past with the arriving unit's commander.  The plot seems to exonerate the departing space marines in one fashion, incriminate them in another.  I actually liked this story, as it threw in some random events unique to the planet, not seeming like a retelling of other stories.<br />\\"Hunter/Prey\\" by Andy Hoare is the next story.  This one deals with a Guard unit near the Eye of Terror facing off against some invading Chaos Marines.  The enemy has some powerful members, and the guard unit does not fare well.  Suddenly, the humans get a new ally, literally from nowhere, who then disappears as fast as he arrived.  I found this story a mite abrupt and unsatisfying.  I just think more could have been done with it, though the notion of eternal conflict between the hero and his enemies gave a nice touch to the story.<br />Sandy Mitchell's \\"The Beguiling\\" wraps up this collection of stories.  This is a Ciaphas Cain story, one of which appeared in another WH40k antho.  Cain is an imperial commissar who would rather not get into trouble, so he tries to find back area places to kick back and relax and stay safe.  However, he never seems to get his wish, and though he onlyever tries to protect himself, he is always hailed as a hero for his actions against the enemy.  This story places him in the middle of two warring bands of Chaos minions, with results not unlike those described above.  I enjoyed this story as I did the prior one I read, as it has a pulp fiction kind of film noir feel to it.  Great stuff.<br />I was a little disppointed in the spelling and grammar errors that were evident throughout this book.  Abnett's story seemed to have more than the others, which I consider very atypical.  I consider only three of the stories herein really to be worth reading, but they all go fast at least.	2004-06-02
US	49106448	RP0JCSD4SLZEM	0345313763	864496271	The Beast Master	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Great tale of coming to terms with one's past	In _Beast Master_ Norton gave us a really good coming of age tale.  Hosteen Storm was a beast master in the now-defunct Patrol.  The military (and the need for his talents) was reduced after their defeat of the Xiks, which came only after those aliens had destroyed Terra.  All Terrans are being repatriated to other human colonies, including Arzor where Storm has arrived.  With him he has brought his Team, a Dune Cat, an African Eagle, and two Meercats.  These are creatures developed and trained to work in concert with the telepathic beast masters.  The eagle is the scout from the air, the meercats the saboteurs, and the cat provides muscle and cunning on the ground.<br />Storm has come for two reasons, to settle snd find a home, and to fulfill a vow made to his Grandfather for revenge.  He has sworn to kill a man named Quade, for what Quade did to Storm's family.  Storm meets with Quade before he is ready, and pretends not to possess the knowledge of his Navajo heritage.  He ends up working with Quade to find that man's son, encountering a umber of natives (&quot;Norbies&quot;), with whom communication consists of sign language due to differing vocal abilities.  <br />Storm signs on to help herd horses, then makes his way to the wilderness with some Norbies in tow.  Exploration leads to danger, as they encounter remnants of an ancient civilzation that had lived upon Arzor.  They also encounter violence, from Norbie-hating humans and some aliens who should not be there.  It falls to the Beast Master team to oppose these foes.  <br />Norton does a good job of presenting mood, exposition, and character development.  The resolution is somewhat abrupt, leaving the reader wanting more.  Eventually more was presented in _Lord of Thunder_.  With new books coming out recently from Norton about the Beast Master, after a 40 year hiatus, I felt a review of the old ones was in order.  They are both enjoyable reads.	2004-04-28
US	49106448	R3K14IV4DZ3D62	0345350804	109454413	The Best of H. P. Lovecraft: Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A collection of great stories	This anthology contains, for the most part, truly excellent works of horror fiction.  Lovecraft is considered by many as the best purveyor of horror fiction of the 20th century, all the more impressive since he did not live beyond the first half.<br />As with most anthos of fiction, there are some truly great stories in this one, some that are so-so, and some that are not so great.  &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot; and &quot;The Music of Erich Zahn&quot; are two of my favorites of this one.  &quot;Call&quot; is the story that really is Lovecraft's best-known, I believe.  It was the first to establish very well the pantheon of the Old Ones that appear in so many of his later stories (including those in this collection).  There have been a number of emulators of his style, and even products by others based on his works (like role-playing games), but it was reading these originals that really made me long for the older days.<br />Lovecraft makes painstaking effort to establish mood and environment.  There are always unknowns, the cornerstone of his horror.  Many take the form of investigations of mysterious happenings, and a number of them are similar to others, but that similarity is more in presentation than in the particulars.  It seems that he did a very good job of using new concepts in all the contained stories.  Some of the stories in this one really could benefit from a reduction in volume.  &quot;The Whisperer in the Dark&quot; simply dragged on way too long.  Despite the reader being well aware from the narrative of what was occurring, the narrator himself seemed unable to make the simple conclusion of his situation.  I really was disappointed in that one.<br />As stated, these stories are classics, and nearly all of them are wonderful reads.  Even some of those that go on too long have something in them of the refinement of the mythology that Lovecraft was creating.  This book is a great buy, even in the slightly more expensive trade paperback format.	2004-04-27
US	49106448	R3OSVJD639BIHL	0345313968	258603697	Lord of Thunder	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Great read	The sequel to _Beast Master_, this book is a good continuation of that storyline.  Picking up several months after Storm and his team dealt with the alien presence on the planet Arzor, Storm's new home, this book starts out with a mysterious migration of the native Norbies.  They are gathering in large numbers, ignoring old enmities with other tribes, and traveling to forbidden regions.  Storm is engaged to search for a crashed human ship at the same time, in the forbidden regions.  What follows deals less with the environment of Arzor than in _Beast Master_, focusing instead on the hidden caverns of the ancient race which once peopled this planet.  There were ruins of their presence on Arzor in the previous book, but nothing like that which is found in this one.  Storm endures a great deal in his attempt to locate potential survivors of the crash, including facing angry Norbies and dealing with hostile creatures and machinery.<br />I like this book, as with the first one, because those parts which are not understood by the characters are not described.  It is really a 3rd person limited POV, and very well done by the Grand Master Norton.  Given that after a 40 year separation Norton has produced some new Beast Master stories, I felt a review of the original stories were in order.  On a side note, the story as presented in these two books is far superior to that of the movies and TV show.  These are much more of a sf focus, with some mystical elements (primarily Amerindian and Norbie &quot;medicine&quot;) added in very nicely.	2004-04-27
US	49106448	R3VMBQVF87J2WX	1844160726	824415416	Ravenor (Inquisitor Ravenor)	Books	4	7	9	N	Y	Another good effort from Abnett	Well, Dan Abnett has once again produced a winner.  Ravenor contains the same great characterization as his many other Warhammer 40k novels, as well as a solid amount of carnage.<br />However, there are a few things I found to detract, unfortunately.  The narrative viewpoint switches back and forth from third person to first (Ravenor himself).  While not terrible, I think that a complete work in third person would have been acceptable.  Also, as a number of the main characters also appeared in the Eisenhorn trilogy, there are allusions to some of their pasts which were detailed in that series but which will be unfamiliar to readers of just this book.  There were a number of typos as well, not the usual case for Abnett's works in my experience.<br />Nevertheless, the story moves fast, with good action and progress.  The plot revolves around Ravenor and company attempting to locate the source of a chaos-inspired drug in use on Imperium worlds.  It leads them to lawless regions in which they are accosted by aliens, traitors, and renegades.  It was clear pretty early on that this was to be the first book in a series, as there were a number of loose ends left unaddressed.  <br />This was still a great book.  It was really enjoyable to read again of some of the compatriots of Eisenhorn.  There are some fond mentions of him from those who knew him, tying this new series to that one even more than the inclusion of returning characters.  This book continues the high-quality that Abnett established in that trilogy, and I look forward eagerly to the next installment.  This book was worth the hardcover price!	2004-04-27
US	49106448	RNYOWBXHQ1YFA	0743417135	129787742	The Flash: Stop Motion (Justice League of America)	Books	4	12	13	N	N	Truly excellent novelization of the Flash	This is one of the best comic character-based novels to date, and the best of the DC novels I have read.  There is great characterization, especially as the point of view focuses on Wally West nearly exclusively.  His insecurities and lack of confidence as a JLA member are dealt with very nicely.<br />Basically, as with other JLA novels, a new villain is created and dealt with, leaving nothing to interfere with the comic universe itself, but adding nicely to the feel of the universe.  There is a new speedster in Keystone City, one who is faster than the Flash.  This new speedster's actions cause some calamitous world disasters, as well as a number of gruesome murders.  The JLA are largely insufficient to the task, with only Wally able to oppose this particular villain.<br />There is great exposition, good atmosphere, and a great comic-book feel.  A number of other JLA members make appearances, though for the most part they are incidental window-dressing.  What I like is that Wally actually is shown to be a round character, with his disposition altered over the course of the story.  I found the ending a bit unsatisfying, somewhat abrupt and without the resolution to the climactic encounter.  Still, this is a great book, and it works even for non-comic readers, as I am a fan of old but not terribly up to date as of the last decade and then some.	2004-03-10

Wow, yet another powerful effort from Michael Stackpole.  I have read every one of his books, and this easily stands at or near the top in terms of quality.<br />The Dragoncrown war continues to rage, with all the devious machinations and backbiting and infighting that Stackpole is so adept at writing.  Secret societies, clandestine meetings and political posturing contribute significantly to this book, as in the previous three in this world of Stackpole's creation.  <br />In the north, a gifted general, Adrogans, had won a great but surprisingly easy victory in the previous book.  Now, some of the results of that swift conquest conspire to turn the assembled nobles of the many kingdoms against him due to fostered suspicion.  In the south, the gifted young woman, Alexia, who from birth was trained to lead armies, is forced to confront experienced leaders in a concerted effort to drive the enemies from the southland.  She is accompanied by a number of remarkable companions, including her lover, Tarrant Hawkins, a disgraced hero of old, are the champions united to lead the forces of the south.  The young wizard, Kerrigan, who had been as much a liability as a boon comes into his own, facing and passing a number of challenges beyond the ken of any but him.  The determined Vorquelf, Resolute, leads a separate band to the north to infiltrate the lair of the evil queen of the north and end her threat forever.  Paramount among his goals is the redemption of his homeland, conquered and defaced by the queen and her minions for over a century.<br />At no point in this book did the story seem to slow.  Stackpole weaves romance, humor, action, and intrigue so well that I simply could not put down the book, and it was done before I realized it!  There are many developments which were foreshadowed, though the manifestation of some events was unexpected.  The characterization is excellent, with some characters being truly respectable, and others simply deserving hatred.  Stackpolehas really come into his own in the creation and development of his own world.  You will not be disappointed in reading this book!  Even the population of spelling and punctuation errors typically so rife in first editions these days is a vast improvement over other recent books.	2004-01-21
US	49106448	R3SDQKIIA0HS6T	0345428528	713415479	The Unifying Force (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 19)	Books	4	1	2	N	N	An excellent end to the series, slightly rushed at the end	James Luceno was given quite a task for completing this series.  Following up the previous great book by Keyes, this novel begins several months after Nom Anor's escape from Zonama Sekot.  <br />Han and Leia work their magic a few more times, fighting against insurmountable odds, managing to squeeze through thanks to some extraordinary circumstances.  Luke and the other jedi along with Zonama Sekot take the fight to the Yuuzhan Vong in a make-or-break confrontation.  Atrocities on both sides continue in this most horrendous conflict the galaxy has ever known.<br />Many characters appear and play notable parts, including some not seen throughout this entire series.  Old enemies are united against the common threat, while the Shamed Ones rise up against their masters.  There is certainly no shortage of combat sequences in this book, both in spacecraft and on the ground.  Some of the best hand-to-hand combat in the series, with the first real efforts by some who have not seen real combat since early in the series.<br />I got the feeling near the end of this massive tome that Luceno was trying extra hard to tie up every loose end.  And I think he wrapped up most everything.  Some things get revealed that are not surprising, given the oft-repeated hints in the long NJO series.  There are no real round characters in this one, though some characters' behavior is certainly erratic, though not necessarily in keeping with the directions they had been heading.<br />I really enjoyed this book, though some of the occurrences at the conclusion are a mite smarmy.  Also, I had expected something more monumental, along the lines of the first book in the series.  I will leave it unsaid if my expectation was fulfilled.  This book (and Keyes' preceding novel) really brought the series to a satisfying end, one that should not disappoint my fellow Star Wars fanatics.	2003-12-03
US	49106448	R2H8C26PCAZL37	0786930241	511579897	1: The Best of the Realms (Forgotten Realms Anthology)	Books	4	31	34	N	N	Basically a bunch of repeats, but one new story	I bought this book primarily to get the R.A. Salvatore story that appears in it.  This story is the only first-appearing story in the collection.  The others are all reprints of stories that have appeared in the various &quot;Realms of...&quot; anthologies over the past decade or so.  I will only review some of the other stories, since they have all appeared previously.<br />&quot;Empty Joys&quot; by Salvatore is the final story in the book, but I review it first since it is the only new story.  This is another tale of Artemis Entreri and Jarlaxle adventuring together.  In this case, they join up with a band of highwaymen.  Salvatore gives some tantalizing information regarding the nature of the relationship between the two fighters, giving some insight into how they regard one another.  It seems that Jarlaxle might not be quite so trusting and cavalier toward Artemis as some readers might have thought.  <br />&quot;Rite of Blood&quot; by Elaine Cunningham tells a story of a young drow female being subjected to her test of adulthood.  The exposition was a bit long compared to a very abrupt resolution, but the treachery and deadly efficiency of the drow is driven home.  My favorite part of this story is the mention of the drow Jarlaxle, suggesting to me that this story takes place further in the past than Salvatore's works.  Other of Salvatore's characters appear and are good to meet again from a different writer.<br />&quot;Elminster at the Magefair&quot; by Ed Greenwood is an okay story, though the end is just unsatisfying.  Again, there is great characterization and development early, only to suffer a brief conflict and resolution.  Basically, Elminster is tricked into collecting a particular item, later being attacked in something of a robbery attempt.  But the reader is left wondering about the backstory of the robber and the item(s) he was after.<br />&quot;And the Dark Tide Rises&quot; by Keith Strohm is a good story.  A young man is lured by a sea elf to theshore and tasked with a mission.  After completing his mission, he manages to get into some trouble trying to revisit said elf.  The end is a pyrrhic victory at best.  This story was very well-written, with good characterization and exposition.<br />&quot;The Rose Window&quot; by Monte Cook is just great.  A priest acquires a special window for his abbey from another being torn down.  He and his assistant begin seeing things in the glass, and things get progressively worse from there.  Cook did a great job of writing a Lovecraftian story in the Realms setting.  The ending makes it so rewarding.<br />&quot;Red Ambition&quot; by Jean Rabe is a good tale of some Red Wizards of Thay.  The typical backstabbing and underhanded reversals of this treacherous group are all highlighted.  However, though they are skilled at deception, are they the best?  Rabe gives a good accounting for those who might think otherwise.<br />&quot;The Greatest Hero Who Ever Died&quot; by J. Robert King is another winner.  Telling of a scheming and murderous plot that brought low a well-respected knight, King draws in the reader with a god plot and good characters.  The tale takes place in a lonely tavern on a cold winter's night, told by a traveler.  The tale takes place in the not-too-distant past, with something of a twist before all is done.  Another great ending.  <br />&quot;Six of Swords&quot; by Connors and &quot;The Common Spell&quot; by Novak-Grubb are pretty worthwhile reads.  Both rely on slight twists to resolve things.  &quot;Blood Sport&quot; by Golden is a good read, telling another part of the life if the elven vampire Jander Sunstar.  The other stories in the book are pretty pedestrian, but not terrible to read.	2003-11-22

After the prior three atrocities in the NJO series, I was so gratified to read this next contribution to the series by Greg Keyes.  Unlike those previous three books, this one is neither plodding nor asinine, but is in fact a great read that moves very fast.  Despite being of decent length, I had finished in less than two hours.  After starting I simply could not put it down!<br />Getting away from the lack of focus in the recent books, Keyes keeps the reader on a much smaller cast of characters.  The Zonama Sekot storyline involving Luke and company plays basically no part.  This book deals primarily with Tahiri, though Nom Anor and Corran Horn play significant roles.  Han and Leia make some necessary rescues as per their standard, while the Happenings on the former Coruscant only appear early on and are not switched back to (which is good since that would distract the reader from the real story here).<br />Tahiri and Corran undertake a covert raid to extract some Vong from their new capital.  Their goal is to locate Zonama Sekot and prove its existence.  Supreme Overlord Shimrra has eliminated evidence of the planet, perhaps out of fear.  The reader is given some clues to the origin of that fear.  It really is the point of this book, and the justification for the other recent works, or so it would seem.<br />The Ryn network that such a big deal was made about does play a minor part, and serves to get Han and Leia involved in this story, thought they are really an extraneous story arc.  There is some good space combat at a classic location from the Thrawn series.  Some of the losses there play a part in the next book, though that is for a later review.  There is some of the typical combat innovation in that battle, on both sides of the fight, making it somewhat gripping, though the end can be anticipated.<br />Overall, while there were no real surprises, there were some very nice suggestions and ticklers, which increase the desire to read the succeeding and final volume in this series.  I highly recommend this book for any reader of the NJO series.  The good thing is that if you stopped because of the previous three books, Keyes does an excellent job of summing everything up (which was better than reading those three books) and moving the story along.  This book really took away the bad taste of the last books, and I bought it only for completion.  I was very surprised and the result was a truly rewarding read.	2003-11-22
US	49106448	R198T76H3D46SY	0786930128	637698164	The Lone Drow (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 2)	Books	4	10	13	N	N	Tough to judge, but not the best out there	Well, I went with four stars, because three just did not feel right.  I really like this book as an exhibition of the style that kept me buying and reading Salvatore's books since I first read The Crystal Shard: fast-paced (for the most part), good exposition, lots of action.  <br />As mentioned by other reviewers, the title is misleading in that not only is Drizzt not the sole focus of the book, but he never really is alone!  Salvatore apparently decided to inject a love triangle thanks to some latent cowardice in Dizzt and the racial [age] difference between elves and humans.  While it is certainly valid, I can see that in the third installment there are two ways to go.  Either love will conquer all or jealousy will tear apart.  I felt that the lead-in, while necessary to attain this plot direction, was somewhat out-of-character.  Recall from The Thousand Orcs that there were two surface elves who together aided those opposing the orcs and giants.  Well, apparently the make decides to venture alone for the first time in the book and winds up causing some problems later.  In all other cases, the two were inseparable, so I felt that this was simply a machination to set things up and it was not the disaster as made out.<br />I love the combat sequences, including the innovative battle techniques that Salvatore seems always to interject.  There is savagery and cunning on the part of the orcs, who rely on weight of numbers to sway the course of battle, while the dwarves rely on tactics, strength and compassion to oppose the monsters.  Deception plays a large roll in the many battles, as well as plain old butchery.  It seems that there is a growing lack of suitable and/or believable enemies for the Companions to face, so Salvatore provides a deity-aided enemy in this one.  It takes some time for the scope of this enemy's abilities truly to be revealed, but we learn that this opponent is quite able to stand against the Companions of the Hall.  He is not Artemis Entreri,though, who was one of the best villains I have ever read and loved to hate.<br />There is little in the way of surprise, save for one late development, which I will not spoil.  Self-sacrifice gets played up a little TOO much, but it is done faithfully in character.  Drizzt gets in touch with his elven side a bit, but the notion of him coaching someone to be like the Hunter I found ludicrous (since it took him a decade in the Underdark to attain that level of detechment and survival instinct).  Some glaring contradictions present themselves, but they are not totally out of character.<br />This book had very little in the way of typos, exceptional among first printings in my experience.  There was some pronoun mixups early, but they were largely consistent and correct later.  There were a few misspellings, but a lot of grammar errors (split infinitives, anyone?).  However, I chose to ignore that in my rating, else it would have been three stars, since it detracted from the reading for me.  But this was a good, fast read, despite being ~350 pages.  Hopefully the third and final book in the series will deliver some more great enjoyment!	2003-11-11

As in Abnett's previous Ghosts novels, there is gruesome depictions of combat not for the squeamish, but the author also mixes in a great deal of the human side of things, with some mysticism thrown in to boot.<br />While it seemed from the previous novel that this storyline was stagnating (at least it did to me), Abnett completely redeemed my faith in him with Sabbat Martyr.  While there are some more unfortunate losses of personnel, both to combat and other less desirable circumstances, I never felt betrayed in any way, as I did somewhat in Straight Silver (two books prior), when one of the better characters died somewhat uselessly.  But authorial fiat is sacrosanct, and Abnett came through in this one.  Despite some attempts at misdirection, the conclusion was not surprising.  There were three main partings of ways in this book, all unfortunate in their own respects, but there were also two reunitings of sorts.  Finally, it seems that there is some hope for the Imperials in this dark future universe.<br />In all ways, atmosphere, characterization, suspense, action, dialogue, Abnett delivers a winner in this one.  While the book might be somewhat confusing for readers not familiar with the characters, nothing really would be missed too much by picking up the story here.  And if you have not read the other six Ghosts novels, what are you waiting for?  Thus far, they have all been worth the read.	2003-09-12
US	49106448	R33BBKSROR7PNP	0743458982	972674723	Hardwired (Transformers, Book 1)	Books	1	2	4	N	N	Save your money, wise consumer	OK, I hate being so critical, but this book has ruined Transformers for me.  The story really goes nowhere, ending nearly as poorly as it began.  There are basically three separate plots, none truly interesting.  Many times various Transformers appear only long enough to die, contributing nothing to the story, save perhaps to spare those that died the horror of getting through the whole book.  I had to flog myself to finish this one.  Also, making a conservative estimate, there was an average of two typos per page, minimum; I cannot imagine that it was proofread at all to end up in this state, full of misspelled words, grammar errors, punctuation errors, and homophone mix-ups.  It was SO terribly distracting, but actually not any worse than the story itself.  There are so many twists and turns that it's impossible to determine the nature of anything, and even though it clearly says &quot;Book 1&quot; on the cover, there still should be a full resolution for this book in itself.  However, there simply is not.	2003-08-06

This book alone should have been the output for these two authors, as it was the only one worth reading, and was not great to begin with.<br />First, the Nom Anor storyline basically went nowhere.  There is nothing achieved, nothing resolved, and it ends basically where it began.  The entire plot should have been omitted from this set of three books.  It would have been better to have a single book focused on that, like the Jacen story of Traitor.  Not this mish-mash jump-around format.  <br />Second, the Han-Leia-Jaina-Jag-Tahiri plot also went about nowhere.  Tahiri has the only growth among them, with the others essentially unchanged from their molds before these two had their go at Star Wars.  Again, the writing was very youth-oriented, in my opinion, seeming to rely upon those things that kids would interpret as romantic or symbolic of great love, when in fact they are not.  The resolution of the Tahiri story also could have been achieved in about ten pages, instead of taking three books.  At least Pellaeon and the Empire do some good.  There should be more focus on good characters like him, as there is a great deal of exploration that could be done regarding the Imperial contribution to the war effort.<br />Third, at least Luke, Mara, Jacen, Saba, et al., managed to accomplish something.  They located the Rogue Planet, and there is some action on that planet.  You can definitely tell that the same guys wrote these three books, since the conflicts in them are all the same formula:  Land on planet, get attacked for no reason by people you do not know, reason with them instead of taking them down, find out they were not responsible for their actions, hug.  It is insulting.  <br />And the book's end was so touchy-feely that I was revolted.  While I can say that they wrapped everythingup, I also have to say that nothing really changed!  Thus nothing needed to be packaged at the end!  I really hope that the next SW:NJO book is plotted and written better (and edited, too, for while this one was less populated with typoes and grammar errors than the first two, it still had WAY too many for my money -- hire a proofreader, dangit!), else I am done with this shared universe.	2003-07-25

These animals serve as spies and assistants, not always engaged in enmity but never totally forthright in manners which might conflict with their master's wishes.<br />The plot centers around Halloween's rare event, and the potential for releasing the bound Elder Gods to reign over Earth again.  Victory will mean life for the winners and death for the defeated.  In an all or nothing contest, and with Zelazny penning the tale, the outcome is left mostly in doubt, though given the narrator's identity and viewpoint, it's not completely uncertain.  My only real complaint was the placement of some of Wilson's illustrations, in that at least one gave away at the beginning of a chapter the fate of one of the players.  Not real upsetting, but they could have placed the drawing at the chapter's end or when the revelation was made instead.  Overall, a great read that goes by just too fast!	2003-07-15
US	49106448	R2CQTS1PHMSTV0	1931484627	174127729	Trial By Fire (R.A. Salvatore's DemonWars, Book 1)	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Great expansion of the Corona world	In both the collection of comics and the original Salvatore short story, this new format graphic novel is a great buy.  First, the artwork of the comics is excellent.  Bringing to life the rich world of Corona, consisting of eight Salvatore novels, the comic series collected here provides a great visualization that does not conflict with that of the novels.  The story follows that of Andacanavar, the Norseman ranger trained by the Elves, upon his return to his people after being trained far from home for nearly his entire life.  The story has two other main characters, Moira, an Abellican Sister, and Grave, a Bloody Cap Powrie Dwarf.  They are united somewhat by coincidence to rescue the abducted daughter of the Norse king.  The combat visuals are as vibrant as those conceived by Salvatore in his novels, with the same sources of treachery as one might expect.  <br />The short story is a nice background for Grave, telling a tale of Powries and pirates combining their skills to sink a third ship.  Of course, the pirates were perhaps stretching the bounds of credulity in trusting the Bloody Caps.  It is nice to see that some get their just desserts.  The story is pretty brief however, likely due to the format in which it's presented, but it has typical great Salvatore prose, telling the first story focused on a Powrie.	2003-07-11
US	49106448	R27FHTR3MAX7GD	0743443551	498316227	Crucible of War (Warhammer 40,000 Novels)	Books	4	19	20	N	N	Anthology of mostly good Warhammer 40k stories	There have been several anthologies of Warhammer 40k short stories released in the last few years, most originating in Inferno magazine.  While there have been low points and high ones, this book is definitely a high point.<br />Farrer and Rusk's \\"Liberation Day\\" is one of the lesser stories in my opinion.  On a space hulk, orks have enslaved a number of humans.  Among these is a man who leads a slave revolt in the hopes of rescue.  The ending is rather lifeless (no pun intended) as what seemes it might be a pyrrhic victory turns into a terrible ending.<br />Dan Abnett's \\"The Curiosity\\" is one of the better stories in this book.  A zoologist has nearly completed a total planetary survey of all life forms, when reports arrive of a new top level predator.  Forced to investigate or have his life's work ruined, the timid scholar joins a hunt for a truly savage beast.  There is not really any great surprise, but Abnett's writing has always impressed me (and his two stories in this collection motivated my purchase -- I was not let down), combining mood, exposition, interesting characters, death, violence -- all the great parts of a Warhammer 40k story.<br />Graham McNeill's \\"Payback\\" is a pretty good story of the backbiting between criminal partners.  There are some pretty good passages in this story that are very memorable, as the protagonist attempts to avenge himself upon his traitorous partner.<br />David Charters' \\"The Emperor's Will\\" is a very good story about an army of Space Marines returning home from a long campaign.  They are diverted at the last minute to deal with some civil unrest on a nearby world.  The leader of the Marines wishes to preserve the lives of those that survived the campaign, despite their own bloodthirsty desire to eradicate the traitors.  The solution is pretty well-deserved upon its victim, as a realtively bloodless victory is secured.  Nice story that puts me in mind of some of the actions of WWII soldiers just trying to survive the conflict.<br />Sandy Mitchell's \\"Fight or Flight\\" (A Ciaphas Cain story) is a great, fun story.  Weaving self-deprecating humor with his own cowardice, the narrator tells of his first assigment as a commissar, one of those entrusted with bolstering morale in the Imperial forces.  Sometimes people just get what they deserve, and this is a good example.  Really enjoyable reading.<br />\\"On Mournful Wings\\" by Si Spurrier tells a tale of two orphans forced to join a contingent of other boys their age to undergo a rite of passage.  This journey is a test for joining a Space Marine force, and utter survival is not the only qualification.  I was not really taken with this story, though it tried to reveal something of the mindset of the Marine selection process at the end.  <br />\\"Backcloth for a Crown Additional\\", an Inquisitor Eisenhorn story, is Abnett's second contribution to this book.  Another great episode in Eisenhorn's long life, I think it did a better job than a lot of the Eisenhorn trilogy.  Much more entertaining and pretty well-conceived, Abnett delivers a story of sleuthing and spirituality, friendship and temerity, that is worth the read.<br />Jonathon Green's \\"Firestarter\\" was another of the low points.  Another gangster-oriented tale, this story simply never interested me. Poor exposition and characters, save for the bounty hunter Creed, who is actually fairly prototypical, disjointed switching if viewpoint, I was not satisfied with this one.<br />Matt Ralphs' \\"Warp Spawn\\" was another so-so effort.  While the ending was nicely orchestrated, as some raiding Eldar are set to get theirs, I was mostly not impressed.  Still an able work, I rank it as being near the middle of the scale among those presented therein.<br />McNeill's second contribution, \\"Leviathan\\", an Ultramarines Story, details the incursion of the Marines into a Space Hulk threatening a world their chapter was long ago committed to protect.  Reminiscent of another Space Marine penetration of a Space Hulk from an earlier anthology, I was not terribly impressed.  Also, some kinda loose threads left me expecting more, only to be disappointed.  Not as good a story as his other in this book.<br />Overall I rate this collection as a great buy.  More of the stories are worth reading than not, in my opinion, and they give a good range of foci for Warhammer 40k stories, giving a good feel for the game universe.  The fiction of this setting is really getting good, and this book demonstrates that ably.	2003-07-04

Instead he found himself as a man without a country, as his throne had been usurped by his murderous, devious sister Katherine.  Though throne-less, Victor salvages some power by being appointed Precentor Martial of Comstar and Commander of the Star League military.  This sourcebook is presented as a briefing from Victor's top intel agent as an update on the present doings among the Inner Sphere realms, the Periphery, and the Clans.  Including a nice military review of the Lyran and Davion halves of the former FedCom over which Victor had ruled, including unit loyalties and deployments, this book gives a good feeling of the major powers for each other as well as their internal assessments.<br />This is a nicely presented sourcebook that allows a good continuation of a Battletech campaign in this time of turmoil before the FedCom civil war (when Katherine finally got hers) and the Word of Blake Jihad (though the WoB has already recaptured Terra and begun their buildup).  There are many hints dropped of things that came later, proving the well-developed course of events that FASA had planned.  For collectors and players alike, this book serves as a good game aid.	2003-07-04

He has amnesia and is drugged and stuck in some strange place.  Effecting a quick escape, he tracks down a familiar name and encounters a few memory-jogging relatives.  From there begins quite an odyssey, the five book series known as the First Chronicle of Amber.  These five books tell a grand story of the grand conflict within an ancient kingdom ruled by demi-godlike individuals.  <br />Corwin, the narrator and protagonist, is one of these ruling individuals.  He is one of the Nine Princes in the book's title, and he is a leading contender for the succession.  His brother Eric, however, has his own designs.  Corwin works to recover his memory and is embroiled in a conflict for the throne of Amber.  There are many mystical aspects to the realm of Amber and the royal family.  And considering how darn many there are, he does a great job of personifying them all.<br />Told in the first person, Zelazny of old did a wonderful writing job in this novel.  Excellent exposition, great fight scenes, good atmosphere, wonderful descriptions.  Easily among the top notch of his novels.  The ending is not as grim as the action right after the climax, which is a good respite.  Suffice to say that Zelazny does not always leave the heroes to be the grand saviors with all enemies falling before them.	2003-06-12

He earlier had passed on a chance to study with Luke and the rest of the newly formed Jedi Academy, but he begins feeling lost. Not certain of his path, he bounces from place to place, essentially trying to find himself via that literary technique known as a hero's journey.<br />His adventures call upon him to use all his past experiences, from his origin as a type of federal agent (for the Corellian Security Force), to his time as an X-Wing ace pilot and member of Rogue Squadron, to the time he spent at the Academy. <br />This story is told first person, and it is quite well done. While among the top as far as length goes for Star Wars novels, this book seemed to go too fast. There was nothing, in my opinion, in the way of dull or dragging parts. Just an excellent novel by an excellent writer.	2003-06-07
US	49106448	R3NDW47H8KLP3H	0380809060	394892878	The Great Book of Amber: The Complete Amber Chronicles, 1-10 (Chronicles of Amber)	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Zelazny's most ambitious and, perhaps, best-known work	This mammot collection of ten novels weighs in at over 1250 pages, of which the first half are great.  <br />Book 1 introduces the universe of Amber, in which all parallel worlds are but shadows of Amber, the one true city.  Corwin, the narrator and protagonist, has been exiled and an amnesiac on a shadow world called Earth.  A few attempts to punch his ticket start a recollection process and he finds his way to some of his fellow scheming siblings and to Amber and the return of his memory.  The rest of this book, and books 2-5, follow Corwin as he undertakes various machinations to make things right, in his own image, though the reader is certainly on his side, as he seems not so much a lesser of various evils, though he is that, but a hero in his own right, despite various mentioned past transgressions.<br />There are numerous illegitimate siblings, backstabbing plots, megalomaniacal villains of miraculous power, and some neat toys in their methods of remote communication and teleportation.  There was not so much in the way of magic or advanced SF-type technology, rather a good tale of redemption and pyrrhic victories.<br />The second set of five novels is narrated by Merlin, another illegitimate Amberite, with roots in the Courts of Chaos as well.  It starts with him in Berkeley on the same shadow Earth that all Amberites seem to visit (according to THIS set of five anyway).  Unfortunately, there is both a very strong presence and dependence of the story on magic that it seems a poor follow up for the first series.  There are SO many twists and turns, and SO many MORE illegitimate Amberite descendents that one struggles to keep up.  There often is nothing in the way of foreshadowing, as these are true surprises.  While this is due to the first-person narration, it is still somewhat annoying, in my opinion.  I think that book 6 is pretty good, and perhaps the latter half of book 10 (which seems somewhat hurried in wrapping things up, and still leaves a great number of loose ends) are good, with 7 being OK, and 8 and 9 seeming to drag on with this not-quite-so-abstract conflict of order versus chaos.  Note that all books are still well-written in that inimitable, incomparable Zelazny prose;  I just disliked the path of the story, but that is, of course, the author's prerogative.<br />Note that this book labels itself the Complete Amber Saga, but there were a number of short stories that Zelazny wrote in the Amber setting that are omitted here.  I personally would have liked their inclusion, but this is still a good weighty book to entertain for a week or so of intensive reading.	2003-06-04

Combining the settings and storylines of the two previous books, Mortalis and Transcendence, Salvatore succeeds in wrapping up many storylines.<br />In the northern kingdom of Honce-the-Bear, Aydrian, the son of Pony and Elbryan, is consolidating his rule while striking out in new directions.  He sends forces to the southern land of Behren, where Brynn Dharielle threw off the tyranny of the capital Jacintha and plunged that kingdom into chaos.  Aydrian's forces are perhaps too ambitious, and Brynn's To-Gai-Ru get involved with resisting the northerners, along with her faithful companions Pagonel (an excellent character reminiscent of other Salvatore characters) and Agradeleous the Dragon.<br />In the north, Pony seeks to warn her friends of the danger of her son, after he let her go free.  She also seeks something of retribution from the elves for their misguided rearing of him.<br />Prince Midalis, the rightful king after Aydrian the usurper killed Midalis' brother, is rallying allies to oppose the ambitious boy.  His distance from the seat of power and lack of numbers does not fare well for him.<br />The elves are faced with a danger unlike any they have ever faced, in a demon-corrupted boy of incalculable power who knows where they live and hates them.  The result of his vengeful attacks comes back to haunt him.<br />There are MANY instances of remarkable and heroic self-sacrifice, though too much success for those who work evil.  There is a gathering in this book of heroes, a gathering perhaps unmatched since Tolkien's Fellowship of the Ring (Please note that I am not making a comparison here, simply trying to cite a previous example of a large band of larger-than-life heroes that readers might identify).  Opposing them, however, is an array of evil that in many ways equals them.  Miscalculations, overestimations, and plain old mistakes combine with derring-do, cunning and courage to bring about the resolution of the many conflicts in this storyline.  Note that many threads are not completely resolved, perhaps being saved for a new series.<br />There were points in this book that I thought were too like Mortalis, in which evil simply seemed unstoppable and would win the day.  The glimmers of light through that dark cloud are too few.  I can say that the final 250 pages or so were riveting.  The stage had been set and the action and scheming were nearly unrelenting.  There are some telling losses, but also some great victories.  There was a surprising number of grammar errors and typos, which I felt did detract slightly from the enjoyment, but near the end I did not notice them as the story was too gripping.  The ending is so heartwrenching that I cannot really describe it.  <br />Please read this book!  There are not many novels released that are so good as this one!	2003-05-19

I cannot fathom how nearly 400 pages can contain NOTHING to advance a storyline.  Even if you are a fan who would normally buy it for your collection, my advice is to skip it altogether.<br />As with the first book in this trilogy, there are numerous spelling and grammar errors (particularly split infinitives, which might be acceptable for speech, but not for narration), fixations on particular words and/or phrases (e.g., &quot;Be that as it may...&quot; is used WAY too often), and inconsistencies.  I still am unaware whether CEDF stands for Chiss Expansionary Defense Force or Chiss Expeditionary Defense Force, since it switches between them repeatedly.  Or perhaps there are two such bodies, one with each name, that share the same acronym; it certainly is not clarified in this book.<br />As with Remnant, book 1 of the trilogy, there are three separate storylines.  One following Luke and others on a quest to find The Rogue Planet (see that book for a story actually worth reading), the second follows Han and Leia et al. investigating comm breakdown from former New Republic Allies, the third focuses on Nom Anor and his infidel uprising on the former Coruscant.<br />All three story lines go nowhere.  For Luke, there is an absolutely pointless and unresolved conflict that occurs on the Chiss homeworld, which we don't even get to see on the star chart, with everything still referred to as the Unknown Regions.  Nevermind that they mention many planets and such, leaving the reader to guess where they might be.  For Han and Leia, on Bakura, there is about 100 wasted pages of poor exposition, again with battles simply for their own sake, serving no plot advancing purpose.  The resolution is disappointing, again with no surprise.  Meanwhile, NOTHING happens with Nom Anor except that he gains an informer.  <br />Honestly, this story reads as though written both by AND for a twelve year old.  It is insulting that this is included in the storylinepopulated by quality writing earlier in the series.  The best thing this book might be used for is recycling.	2003-05-11
US	49106448	R1BXEU10H7T4G2	0743443276	735945182	Riders of the Dead (Warhammer Novel)	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Somewhat slow start, typical great Abnett finish	The early portions of this book are not consumed with the typical fire of Abnett's other books, e.g., the Gaunt's Ghosts Warhammer 40k novels, but there are many good things to recommend this book.<br />First, for readers who are unfamiliar with the Warhammer Fantasy universe, things might be a bit confusing, but Abnett does a good job of explaining things as they come, focusing more upon the characters and their plights than on the game world.  <br />There are two main characters, who begin the story very different from how they are at the novel's end.  One was born into nobility, and is very haughty and overbearing, while the other is of lesser birth and has worked very hard to improve his station.  They are fellow horse soldiers in the Empire, sent to help the defense against the northern hordes. <br />They quickly become separated, and their lives follow very different paths both from each other and from their previous existences.  One is captured by the evil northern forces and is slowly corrupted by them, while the other falls in with the barbarians of the steppes, tenuous allies of the Empire.  Both experience radical changes of perspective and personality before the climax of the novel.  <br />Besides what I thought was a slow start, it seemed that the end was almost too quick.  Perhaps this in itself is a statement of the way of life in the Warhammer world, but for a novel it seemed very hurried and disappointing.  Don't get me wrong, now, for the last 75 pages or so I could not put the book down.  But for the first hardcover Warhammer book, I would have liked a longer novel with more resolution than was given, though the very end was quite nicely done.<br />Basically, I really liked the story, but I think most people should wait for the paperback, as this is not quite worth the hardback price.  Personally, I hope that the Black Library puts out more hardcover books (again, Gaunt's Ghosts, guys!), but that they make it more worth the price.  For [the money], I want a longer read than this one.	2003-05-03
US	49106448	R3C8D2NLU9K3RZ	0345428706	141218621	Remnant: Force Heretic I (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order)	Books	2	12	15	N	N	You can skip the first half...	While I love the Star Wars series of novels, this latest is really lacking in comparison with the earlier releases.  (To be honest, in my opinion, none have matched the level set by Stackpole in the beginning of the NJO.)  For most of the book, the characters are wooden, as the authors relate large amounts of the previous installments to explain the current emotional states of the characters and the political status of the galaxy.  Almost nothing new happens in the first half, and if you've read the earlier books, it reads like a re-run.<br />There are two separate missions that are followed, plus the exploits of the persistent Nom Anor.  The first of these (arbitrarily chosen) has Luke, Mara, Jacen, and some others trying to find a lead on the location of Zonama Sekot (the world from Rogue Planet).  To do this, they journey to the Imperial Remnant to ask for information.  Of course, they get embroiled in combat, as the Empire finally decides to fight the Yuuzhan Vong.  That is really the only development in this entire novel, and the only part that kept me interested.<br />The second mission has Han, Leia, Jaina, Tahiri, and Jag, plus some not-so-noteworthies, investigating the breaks in communication to old members of the New Republic.  In this, we see an end to the Yevetha (from a pre-NJO terrible set of books) and some really boring scenes of the small force wiping out a minor group of Yuuzhan Vong.  We get a lot of focus on Tahiri, as Jag is suspicious of her, and she is apparently dealing with the resurfacing after-effects of the Yuuzhan Vong attempt to shape her MANY novels ago.  There is an attempt to breed mystery and suspense, but it flops badly (again, Stackpole leads the way in such intrigue and action).<br />In the third thread, Nom Anor on Yuuzhantar (Coruscant) links up with a group of shamed ones and hides from the real members of their society.  Again, there is little accomplished in this vein of the story, though it seems that perhaps Nom Anor is the Force Heretic of the title, and not NECESSARILY Tahiri Veila, though it could be both.<br />So, as I mentioned earlier, there is little to no development of any of the characters.  There are no new characters introduced who are worth any mention.  I did like the confrontation of Pellaeon with the Moff Council near the end, but other than that this novel is really below par for the series.  Succeeding the good inroads made two novels ago, with Traitor, after a repetitious series of similar stories, we are given THIS.  Also, the setup of this book has no chapter divisions, simply break lines where the story line switches.  Not really unacceptable, but certainly noticeable.  Also, it seems that during the writing, the authors would hook onto a juicy long word, and use it three or more times in a few pages, then never use it again.  If you read it, you'll see what I mean.  Overall very poor writing.  And considering that this is among the longest of the series (400+), I had hoped for good things to happen, not to get a lot of fluff.	2003-02-14
US	49106448	R1N86L7APEYAIW	0756400821	332301430	Sol's Children	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Great SF close to home	This anthology is comprised of seventeen stories taking place at varying points in the future within our solar system.  From the moon to Mercury to Pluto to the asteroid belt, all the planets or their moons are used as settings.  <br />Timothy Zahn's \\"Old-Boy Network\\" takes place on Mars; it is a story in which the human toll from avaricious greed is revealed.  The ending is as good as one could hope, were we in such a position.  Brian A. Hopkins' \\"Mirrors\\" and Mike Stackpole's \\"Least of My Brethren\\" both give insight into how we should treat those beings we create through genetic engineering to be subservient.  In their humanity, be it vengeful or sacrificial, their true hearts are revealed, regardless of their outward humanity.  Jack Haldeman II's \\"In Finnegan's Wake\\" and Brian Thomsen's \\"The Grand Tour\\" take us on a tour of the system in the guise of a race (Haldeman) or a last great exploration (Thomsen).  In \\"Finnegan\\" two people try to triumph over their personal ghosts, while in \\"Tour\\", a poet ends up siding with scientists and the great curiosity latent to humans.  John Helfers' \\"Ghosts of Neptune\\" is the longest in the collection, and is not too bad.  While seeming familiar to other stories, this seemed more apt to be expanded into a novel rather than being the short we are given.  Rusch's \\"Moments\\" and Bingle's \\"Patience\\" give us tales of murder.  The difference is that one is the result of corporate profit-enhancement, the other of unadulterated madness.  Bingle's story is one of the best in the book, in which I particularly liked the lack of hypocrisy in the murderer.  Jeff Crook's \\"'Roid\\" is another good story.  One man makes a sacrifice in vain to do what he believes is right, though we learn his efforts were all for naught.  \\"The Demons of Jupiter's Moons\\" by Resnick and Stafford gives a good accounting of man vs. alien.  Those little beasties aroused the wrong sleeping dragon.  Dupree's \\"Ringflow\\" and Gibson's \\"Acceptable Risk\\" both give us examplesof exploration efforts gone bad.  While neither end well for those involved, the end was the choice of each, and is somewhat ennobling in itself.  Sullivan's \\"Martian Knights\\" is a good man vs. machine conflict.  Making good use of irony, he shows us that not all members of a group should be judged by their fellows of that group.  Davis' \\"Omega Time\\" tells the story of a man who could live without his deceased wife, but faces the promis he made that they would be together, in his mind not just unto death, but beyond it.  Green's \\"Son of a Belter Earl\\" is really not a good story.  It moves slowly and is uninteresting, doing nothing for the collection.  Pack's \\"A Coin for Charon\\" illustrates very well that trust is too easily misplaced.  Know your friends well, it seems, to ensure they are not, in fact, your enemies.  <br />I really liked this collection, which has SF stories in nearly every vein:  Hard SF, horror, mystery, humor...  The authors are a mix of well-known and lauded with lesser-known up-and-comers.  Overall the stories are great, though some of the stories suffer from egregious misspellings.  The truly great thing about these stories is that they nearly all deal not just with humans and their reactions and behaviors, but with humanity and our plight against the universe and each other.  That's what SF is really all about.	2003-01-29

THe heroes go their separate ways to recuperate.  Wonder Woman returns to her home island of Themyscira to search for a missing diver in that area of the Bermuda Triangle.  When she finds that the man is not on her home, she begins to search for him, thinking perhaps there might be an additional island hidden nearby.<br />Along with the wife of the missing man, Wonder Woman finds this other island, which is the opposite of her own home.  This new island is populated entirely by men, with the missing man among them.  During an abortive attempt to cheat fate, she manages to help a proscribed course of events along its course.<br />Among the results of her rescue attempt, the island begins to intrude upon our dimension, causing much in the way of tectonic upheaval.  The rest of the Earthbound JLA main team journeys individually to investigate.  As per the usual, all but one of the team is captured, though it is one of these that effects the release of the others.  A big battle never really happens, though an ancient Greek god does make an appearance.  In the end, the day is saved and nothing has been altered in terms of the JLA membership.<br />As in the title of this review, this book is simply average among other comic-based novels.  There is also some glaring inconsistency between this book and the previous JLA book, The Stone King.  In the other book Wonder Woman and Superman journey unprotected to the center of the Earth, yet in Mythos, Wonder Woman is unable to approach closely to a lava flow, which temperature is far less than the Earth's core, and alos lacking the core's extreme pressure.  Someone needs to keep these things correlated correctly.  Stalwart JLA fans might like it more than others, but I am hopeful the next book will improve things.	2003-01-25
US	49106448	R10NQ6KYAQPN4T	074344325X	1877704	Straight Silver (Gaunt's Ghosts: Warhammer)	Books	4	7	8	N	N	A lesser book in the series, still a good military sf novel	Hmm, I nearly fell into the trap of comparing this book with the others in the series, which are easily superior to this one.  That is not the issue, though, what matters is: how good is THIS book considered on its own?  Again, we find the Tanith First embroiled in a conflict in which they are forced to follow asinine orders which do not use their abilities appropriately.  In this manner, Abnett subjects them to one of the more antiquated forms of combat, that being trench warfare as in World War I, with chemical weapons in use.  While antiquated with respect to their usual mode of combat (something mentioned explicitly several times), it is occurring on a planet for which that is the level of development.  Also, they are constrained to follow the orders of the planetery officials in prosecuting the war.  More of that hell that is war, it seems.<br />Little progress is made in advancing the characters from the state they occupied at the end of the previous novel.  It seems almost like Abnett hit a length limit and simply stopped the book, making this novel almost a brief transition in the series.  There is more mysticism like that used in Honor Guard, which seems basically to foreshadow something in the next book.  The really likable characters do well, though as before a lot of them get shot up.  There is one REALLY unlikable character who again comes through (in Guns of Tanith he murdered one of the major characters in the regiment), it seems to me, simply to have a villain in the ranks (nevermind that there are already several who hate the commander, Gaunt; I guess we needed someone for the regular ranks to battle).  <br />All in all, this is the weakest book yet in the series.  It does serve well, though, in introducing new readers to the present state of the characters and the setting.  Given that this is the sixth in the series, perhaps he and the editors felt such a book was called for.  The ending is pretty unsatisfying, since, as I mentioned, this book seems to be simply a setup for the next book.  The writing, though, is very well done, in terms of describing the atmosphere and emotions of those in the trenches or in the no-man's-land.  Mixing conflict, humor, suspense, sacrifice, triumph and tragedy, Abnett still delivers a great read.	2003-01-13
US	49106448	RBRGCXB64K8SB	0743417100	665010316	Batman: The Stone King (Justice League of America)	Books	4	2	3	N	N	A good comic-based novel	Over the last few years, there has been a dearth of good comic book-based novels, since the Marvel efforst have really faltered.  I was pleased to see that DC has begun putting out books, starting with a few Batman novels, even a Wonder Woman book.  Now they have started releasing Justice League books.  It seems that they will be releasing them with a specific character as the focus, in this case Batman.<br />The book opens with the Justice League working their minds and muscles to save Gotham City from disaster.  A result of their solution is that an ancient pyramid is uncovered, the archaeological find of all time it seems.  Unfortunately, the history of that pyramid leads to disaster the world over in terms of the spirit of one who was slain there.<br />This spirit possesses a student and begins wreaking havoc.  Having learned something of the world from this student, the first efforts are geared toward subduing those who could stop his planetary domination, the super heroes of the Justice League.  He manages to capture most of the main lineup, as it were, with Batman escaping and Martian Manuhunter not being present.  Since it is in Gotham, Batman is able to bring his resources to bear against the villain.<br />The action proceeds from there, with little in the way of surprises.  I dislike how some things were mentioned again and again and again, as though the reader would forget them from one chapter to the next.  It does not really detract from the story, however.  Personally, I have grown unfamiliar with the DC universe, and this book served as a good refresher, in that the back story to many characters is given.  There was one thing in particular that disturbed me, as to how one of the heroes escaped his prison, as it seemed he was just suddenly free, but such things happen in comics sometimes, so I am inclined to let it go.  I think JLA fans will enjoy this book, Batman fans, too.	2003-01-13
US	49106448	RLFWBM2XI1NIG	0553379208	869489956	When Dragons Rage (The Dragoncrown War Cycle, Book 2)	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Another Stackpole masterpiece	First, I think that the title is a bit misleading, given that there are no actual dragon appearances until the latter 20% or so of the book, and considering the length of the book, this makes for little dragon rage.  <br />Picking up nearly immediately after the end of Fortress Draconis (FD), Stackpole spends the first few chapters refreshing the reader's memory of what transpired in the previous book.  As with FD, the story is told via focusing on a different character each chapter.  As with FD, we see things from the viewpoint of Will the thief and prophesied savior, Alexia the warrior princess, Kerrigan the wizard and Adrogans the general.  We also are introduced to several new players, including Isaura, the adopted daughter of the southlands' scourge, Chytrine, and one of the two sons of the despicable King Scrainwood.  Hawkins, the narrator of Dark Glory War (DGW) and the pariah of the South, and Resolute are again relegated to supporting roles.<br />This novel comprises another fantastic effort of prose.  The classic Stackpole action and suspense and political maneuvering is a major factor.  Some of the history and philosophy of the world is also addressed, which I found rewarding.  There is also a pair of love stories that crop up, and they are very well done without seeming to be tacked on as in some other fantasy novels.  Will, in particular, is VERY well written, especially as regards his acceptance of his foretold path and, basically, his growth as a person and a leader of men.  <br />Again in this series, the ending leaves something of a foul taste in the mouth.  While neither FD nor this book are as stunning as the end of DGW, the lack of closure is frustrating in light of needing to wait a year for any resolution.  Many of the things that in other reviews are listed as surprises really should not be considering the foreshadowing throughout both FD and this book.  And I think that the seemingly tragic occurrence near the end might be easily resolved when one considers the Norrington Prophecy (in the front of the book).  So, while I have a few complaints, this book is a must-read, not only for those who have started the series, but for any readers of the highest quality epic fantasy available.	2002-12-17

Having read the book in very short time, despite its length, I must say my loyalty was rewarded.<br />Following a different path than any of the previous books in the Demon Wars setting, Salvatore explores an entirely different culture than in those ealier novels.  Thus we are not re-hashing any of the same old story lines as before.  While there is a returning character, he holds true to his form while still managing to grow from his prior mindset.  The main character appeared in the last book, but she was only a minor player.  Here she is allowed to grow.  The events of this book occur simultaneously with Ascendence, with each book referring to events transpiring in the other.<br />Having completed her Elven training, Brynn Dharielle embarks on her quest to liberate her people from their conquerors.  With her is Belli-mar Juraviel, her Elven companion and mentor.  Early in their journey, they become sidetracked, the circumstances of which gain them a new companion.  In their effort to traverse the mountains and gain Brynn's homeland, another significant branch is added to the storyline.  <br />In addition to the good guys mentioned above, there are also the conquerors.  Some of the political machinations of these religious fanatics described by Salvatore are just delicious, while many of the resulting actions are quite disturbing.  The main character from this group is the leader of the Behrenese peoples, and the architect of the conquest of Brynn's homeland.  While he is supprted by religious fervor and thrives upon it, it is quite clear that he is both a heretic and a hypocrite, making him one to love to hate.<br />There is another new set of characters in the guise of an enclave of reclusive monks.  One of the major characters in the story is a member of this monastery, and he is a great character, often proving to be a moral foil to Brynn and others with his blunt innocent statements and questions.<br />For character development and the new setting for the world of Corona, Salvatore has outdone himself, and far surpassed the previous book in the series.  Fantasy readers will love this one.	2002-12-13

After a leap of several decades into the future from the last Battletech novel, things have changed far more, perhaps, than during the entire succession wars period.  Nearly all the familiar characters from the past are dead, leaving only a very limited tie to the past;  in fact there is really only one returning character from the old days.  <br />Humanity is still fractured with regards to any single galactic government, but there has been an inroad to peace, if only in a limited region of space.  Unfortunately, though this new principality has been around for a while, it is not so secure as its residents might hope.  The initiation of the Dark Age concept actually occurs several months before the book begins, with the centuries-old, high-speed interstellar communications network being sabotaged by unknown conspirators.  This has forced all the interdependent worlds to begin fending for themselves for the first time in a long time.  The results are frightening, with power being seized by very unsavory individuals.  <br />Writing in the first person, a first for any of the Battletech/Mechwarrior series, Stackpole shows the same brilliant prose and excellent action and intrigue that his readers have come to expect from him.  While the game line might not appeal to all the old fans, I think that the new storyline will.  Except for a few re-drawn political lines, the universe is still recognizable.  And for new readers to the game universe, Stackpole does a good job in bringing the reader up to speed on the past 60+ years of the Inner Sphere.  I highly recommend this book.	2002-12-10
US	49106448	R1VK7UN8MQOD0	0786928042	926952674	The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms:  The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)	Books	4	11	13	N	N	Somewhat slow start but a great finish	Whenever an author has written an extended series of books about the same characters, there is always inclusion of a period of introduction (or reminders) of significant events.  This is mainly for new readers of the series.  For those who have read the previous works, this can be tedious.  Such is the case for this book.  However, without being cumbersome, Salvatore managed to hit the major events in the characters' lives to illuminate some of their motivations.  The problem is that there are a good many characters that require this, so it seems to take a while.<br />As with all of the books in this series, there are great combat action sequences.  The gist of the story is that there are numerous orcs and giants uniting in the north to menace the goodly races (human, dwarf, elf).  This happens as the companions are returning to Mithral Hall for Bruenor to reclaim his crown.  They are diverted from this course to avenge the deaths of those early victims of the orc/giant alliance.  This diversion leads the companions into significant danger, with Wulfgar acting as counselor to Catti-Brie at one point.  This and the event that precipitated it give some conflict and depth to her character which persists the rest of the novel.  Regis continues acting contrary to his early ways, and his inner reasons for this are discussed.  Drizzt, meanwhile, is Drizzt, narrating the book through section introductions.  He does not play any larger a part than the other characters, though he does shine as per his usual.<br />There is significant inclusion of previous Salvatore characters, not only those originally from this series, as the Dwarven brothers from the Cleric Quintet appear.  New characters are also introduced, on both sides of the conflict.  Salvatore manages to weave political intrigue into the mix, again on both sides, to great effect.    <br />The climactic battle of this novel occurs in the defense of a remote village against the evil hordes.  This takes a good portion of the end of the novel, but it flies past.  Facing insurmountable odds, the companions battle on.  Humor even finds its way into the mix before all is done.  <br />As the title of this review indicates, I thought that the book started slow, but this was mostly due to the introductory process I noted earlier.  The several segregated storylines are united in the end to a satisfying conclusion.  I truly think that this book will appeal to both new and established readers of the series.  And trust me, you, like me, will be dismayed that another year will pass before the next book in the series is released.	2002-10-28
US	49106448	R3KA9ZJJKQB8GX	034542865X	707181604	Traitor (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 13)	Books	4	36	39	N	N	An intense and gratifying read	In TRAITOR, Matthew Stover gives one of the first real hero journeys in the NJO series.  Jacen Solo was captured by the Yuuzhan Vong shortly after his brother Anakin died.  It has long been advanced that he was subsequently killed by them.  Stover provides the action which led to Jacen's severance from the force causing even his twin sister Jaina to believe him dead.  <br />While all the previous NJO novels boasted a large supporting cast, TRAITOR possesses only six characters.  The foremost of them are Jacen and Vergere.  Vergere has appeared several times in past NJO novels, as well as some Pre-Empire novels.  Always enigmatic, she plays both friend and foe to Jacen, seemingly helping ease his pain at times during his indenture, other times aiding those who hold him.  Constantly throughout the book, the reader is forced to wonder exactly whose side she is on, if on any side at all other than her own.  Thankfully, it seems this question is honestly resolved at the book's end.<br />As a prisoner, Jacen is first subjected to what any reader would regard as torture, but not for any specific purpose, e.g., gathering of information.  This motivation, among others, is part of the learning Jacen must experience in order finally to find a path for his life.  In previous novels he has appeared only as a whiner, always wondering if he is doing enough, too much, or simply the wrong thing.  While he must suffer much, he gains wisdom and experience unique among Jedi.<br />This book is filled with some of the most descriptive writing in the series, but it lacks some of the flamboyant action and violence typical of some of the past books.  If you really want space combat and individual battles of Jedi and Yuuzhan Vong, this is really not the book for you.  While there are some moments, they all serve to educate and mature young Jacen.  There is a very significant combat at the end involving a figure not seen much since the earlier novels in the series in which he played a noticeable role.  <br />I really enjoyed this book, as it was more cerebral and psychological in nature than those preceeding it in the series.  It is a short book, though, under 300 pages, ending too quickly for my enjoyment.	2002-08-02
US	49106448	R3FZV393304XU7	0345428684	499156103	Rebel Stand: Enemy Lines 2 (Star wars: The New Jedi Order)	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Better and better	Wow.  That's really all I can say.  I have just finished reading Rebel Stand, easily the best NJO novel yet.  Once I started (with the previous novel, Rebel Dream, being almost necessary to understand all the plot devices taking place), I just could not stop.  Allston expertly weaves humor, compassion, desperation, and dedication into the plot and the characters.  <br />On Coruscant, the mysterious dark force presence, which drew Luke and the Wraiths to investigate, is revealed.  Formidable is truly an understatement.  In this, Allston uses a character that was a very loose end from years past in the pre-NJO series, one that I am pleased to have revealed, finally.  There is also some very good suspense as Allston sets the stage for the events that culminate.  Gotta LOVE infiltration of a Vong-conquered world by the best ever, plus a few jedi.<br />On Borleias, where Wedge is commanding a stalwart and devious defense using remnants of Coruscant defenders to give the Yuuzhan Vong a good pasting, we get plenty of space combat mixed with good old Rebel ingenuity.  There are many uses of technology and trickery which surfaced in previous books in the series.  Foremost among them, and possibly the most satisfying, is the impersonation by Jaina Solo of the Vong trickster Goddess.  This gives an extra twist in the guts of the enemy as they are desperate to capture her so that they might set her against her captured brother (whom we have not seen since Star by Star, but to which there is a reference by Tsavong Lah.  This seemed to me the only foreshadowing of the next NJO installment.  My guess is that they have converted Jacen into a Vong-warped dark jedi, as they failed to do with Tahiri, who shines in this book, by the way.  It would explain his lack of presence in the force.  Enough of this digression, though :) .). <br />If you like Star Wars, or the NJO, or if you have become tired from some of the earlier installments in the series, this book will restore your faith.I can't give any book a higher recommendation.	2002-06-02

This time, there are some very different major obstacles to overcome if they are to win.  <br />Phandine is an industrial world, and has been so for centuries.  The planet has been so raped as to be uninhabitable save in extreme elevations, and even then the air is toxic and domes are required to survive.  The planet is essential to the war effort through provision of fuel and similar necessary chemicals.<br />Gaunt and Company are tasked with subduing one of three domes on one of the various habitats.  As has come to be the norm for them, the Ghosts quickly find that their plans are not quite achievable.  fortunately, they are masters of improvisation, and it helps to get a little precognition before the battle.<br />While they always seem to be in hard-fought battles, this time they are facing some truly talented opposition in the Blood Pact.  Not only these chaos troopers are after them, though, as there are aliens that have allied themselves with the Blood Pact in hating humanity.  And since the Blood Pact have held this world for some time, you can be sure that they have prepared well to defend it.<br />Abnett consistently puts out high-quality work.  All the Gaunt's Ghosts novels are above par, and they are the best of the Warhammer 40k novels (only Abnett's Eisenhorn novels come close).  If you have tried any of the other Ghosts novels, you'll find nothing in this one to disappoint.	2002-05-06

Especially those who are rebelling against his authority, Doctor Octopus mainly.<br />Spider-Man is still besieged by doubt over the origin of Pity, the newest Six member.  Implications from the previous novel in the trilogy pointed to her being his sister, but there are still considerations to support the contrary.  <br />The story moves along very fast, and is the first among the Marvel novels really to have some graphic violence.  But it is not too gratuitous, keeping in character with the murderers it is related to.  Sometimes the story might seem a bit disjointed due to the narrative style of going back several minutes in time to describe what was happening off-stage, as it were.  There are some twists near the end, but they are not too surprising.  There is good resolution and updating with regard to the comics, as Castro fills in a bit on what the future holds for our villains after this novel occurs.  The very end gives us some revelations that, to me at least, seemed tacked on.  A certain character appears to provide these new insights.  The only part of this interaction that I liked was the reactions of Peter and Mary Jane to finding this person in their home.  Now THAT was funny.<br />I liked this book, as it really kept to the comic book perceptions of the characters.  However, there were an atrocious number of typos, grammar errors, and just poor editing, even for a first edition like this.  It really detracted from the reading experience, so my advice is to wait for a later edition;  hopefully this issue will be rectified.  Spidey fans should definitely like this one.	2002-04-30

We see much less Jar-Jar Binks, no mention of midi-chlorians, and TONS of battles.<br />The story begins ten years after The Phantom Menace (TPM).  Palaptine is still the Supreme Chancellor, having circumvented term limits through some inventive politics, and is embroiled in a major crisis.  The main point of the book, in my opinion, is the same as that in TPM, to display the machinations of Palpatine on his path to becoming Emperor.  While we don't see him appear as Darth Sidious with the frequency he did in TPM, this is due to superior maneuvering requiring less direct involvement.<br />Much of the story focuses on the budding relationship between Anakin, the Padawan learner of Obi-Wan, and Padme Amidala, now the Senator from Naboo.  Anakin has been given his first solo mission, that of protecting Padme, thus forcing them into close, unsupervised contact much of the time.  While their interactions seem more at place in a grade school, this might be explained away due to their collective inexperience.  <br />Obi-Wan, meanwhile, is investigating an assassination attempt, and he discovers some truly remarkable things.  Along the way he also has some deadly encounters.  The final stages of this story center around what he has discovered on a secluded planet.  And we get to see a truly epic scale combat involving many jedi.  <br />I thought the ending came a bit suddenly, without the resolution of TPM, but this might simply be setting the stage for the next film.  I couldn't put down this book, especially during the last one-third or so.  The action is just too engrossing.  If you're willing to overlook the many typoes and grammatical errors you'll have a great experience reading this book.  And if you are more dedicated than I and wait for the movie first, please read thisbook afterward, as it is a great novelization of a movie.	2002-04-29

I think this just might be the best novel Asimov wrote, and it happened to be completed just before his death.<br />The novel consists of four parts, each separated by about ten years.  This is really about Seldon, and the path his life takes.  In the first part, many things are simliar to Prelude, the Empire is falling to pieces, an old friend from the Robot series is the person functionally running the empire, and psychohistory is still just a fledgling science.  He and his wife, who is his protector (appointed by Daneel Olivaw), have adopted the young boy they encountered in Prelude.  The events of this first part see the departure of Daneel, with Seldon being unexpectedly elevated to fill his position.<br />Part two deals with Seldon's life as a political functionary, running the dying empire while trying to hammer out psychohistory so that he can save humanity.  Again, a major character exits the scene, but not quite as one might expect.  This results in Seldon exiting politics and focusing solely on his work in part three.  Governmental authority has been assumed by the military, and psychohistory is finally able to make some predictions.  Hari loses an old friend and his family uncovers a plot to kill someone, they think Hari is the target.  While the plot twists a bit in this part are VERY well done, the end is really tragic.  This time Hari lost the most important person in the galaxy to him.<br />In part four, Hari is essentially all alone, with only his granddaughter remaining of all the friends and family he once had.  His son and daughter-in-law each meet unfortunate fates, while the capital planet Trantor is now feeling the decay that the empire as a whole has felt for some time.  Hari is forced to make some decisions that enable the second foundation to be created, though it also costs him someone dear.<br />The endingis as one might expect, the death of the great one, as readers of the series would know.  He manages to wrap things up in time, at least enough to set things on the track that psychohistory saw fit, and that the second foundation can steer.<br />I really think this was a story of Asimov himself in many ways.  It deals with a brilliant man, recognized as such during his own lifetime, who deals with the loss of his friends and family as he outlives them all.  But still he works.  And he dies while working.  Asimov himself said that he identified with Seldon more than any of his other characters, and after chronicling the life and death of Seldon, Asimov himself died.  He is already sorely missed.	2002-04-27
US	49106448	R2PR079TWFMS53	0586071105	834333861	Foundation and Earth	Books	4	22	26	N	N	The series comes full-circle	As the last chronological addition to the Foundation series before he died, Isaac Asimov gave SF readers a gem.  The story begins immediately after the ending of Foundation's Edge, when Golan Trevize decided the fate of humanity that all should eventually form a single superorganism called Galaxia, enlarging the present superorganism called Gaia.  The main characters are Trevize;  Bliss, a part of Gaia;  and Pelorat, a scholar.  The drive of the story is a continuation of the previous book, in that Trevize seeks Earth, mainly to determine why all records of it have been expunged.  Additionally, Trevize is allowing his previous decision to hinge upon the end result of their odyssey across the Milky Way - if he wants, he can reverse his choice and Galaxia will NOT go forward, and humans will remain the independent interactors we are today.<br />There are few clues remaining to direct them, and they first visit a planet the readers saw in Robots and Empire, though it was under a different name.  The path of the three is constantly accompanied by debates between Trevize and Bliss about the nature of life and whether a superorganism is the best option.  Based on the obstacles and encounters they meet, the end decision is relatively predictable.<br />In this novel, we see two of the spacer worlds, one which was the first, Aurora, and one which was the last, Soloria.  First stop among the spacer worlds is Aurora, which gives a grim picture of what happens to a terraformed planet once the humans have gone extinct.  Their trip to Solaria solves a riddle from R&amp;E as to what happened to the Solarians.  Again, not the most pleasant evolution of an advanced society.  The implications of this visit really affect Trevize's decision.  Their next stop is a nearly completely dead world, but one that gives them a clue to Earth.<br />After a brief stop at Alpha Centauri, they finally locate the home system of humanity, but Earth is as readers of the series would expect from R&amp;Eand from the Empire series:  Earth is a completely uninhabitable radioactive wasteland.  The actual endpoint of their voyage is a nice surprise, in my opinion, but not nearly so much as who we meet at the end, a dear old friend.  This meeting wraps up many issues, and Trevize makes his final decision regarding the fate of mankind.<br />This book is excellent, though not quite a &quot;Foundation&quot; book in my opinion, as we never really deal with that government, save in very tertiary ways.  Like most of Asimov's novels, the story is the main thing, but there is some good character development.  And if you couldn't guess from the rest of this review, it was really nice to re-visit so many once-familiar places and to meet some old friends.  I hope you enjoy it, too.	2002-04-27
US	49106448	R19JOKVXRT7FFV	0553379194	541233613	Fortress Draconis (The DragonCrown War Cycle, Book 1)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Truly great epic fantasy	Being the first book in the Dragoncrown trilogy, Fortress Draconis takes place 25 years after the Dark Glory War.  In the end of that book, we see nearly all of that generation's heroes perverted into the service of the evil queen of the north, Chytrine.  The only one to escape was the previous novel's narrator, Tarrant Hawkins.  Having been named a coward and a traitor, for being the only one to return, he now goes by the name of Kedyn's Crow (Kedyn is the God of Warriors in this world).  <br />While there are several notable characters from DGW making significant contributions to this work, the focus is really on three new heroes for this age.  Will, an orphan turned street thief, may just be the crux of the entire war against Chytrine, based on a prophecy from the prequel volume.  Kerrigan is a young wizard who has been bred and trained to be better than any other human wizard in memory, yet his sheltered upbringing may be his own doom.  Alexia, whom we saw in DGW as an infant barely being rescued from the invading forces, has grown into a true warrior princess, having been raised among the Gyrkyme, half-breeds of elves and giant birds.<br />This novel takes the reader to many of the same places as in DGW, allowing us to see the effects of time.  While some places have improved in the previous quarter-century, others have decayed.  Those characters who were of good character still are, while those whose might have been questionable have only grown worse.  The armies of Chytrine have grown more powerful, mostly due to the larger number of Generals, the evil-perverted, magically-altered heroes of the previous age.  Also, her technology has grown further.  Whereas in the first novel, she had but one cannon, the first usage of gunpowder in this fantasy world, now there are musket-like weapons and cannons abounding, for both sides, but she manages to have innovations to counter the growing armories of the good.  As before, there is the presence of magic, but it is notoverwhelmingly done.  <br />Again, Stackpole gives us some characters to love, some to hate.  It is difficult that now some of those to hate were just the opposite in DGW.  Again, we have a depressing ending, but one that can be seen coming from a great distance.  But never fear, a provision was made earlier with the character Resolute in regards to a certain magical enchantment.  Comeuppance will be delicious.  <br />As far as fantasy novels that have been published recently, I rank this easily among the top of any author out there.  You get all the elements you might want from a fantasy novel, and you get a LOT of it, with over 500 pages to satisfy you.  Happy reading!	2002-04-26
US	49106448	R1GT3USND03HCF	0553578073	225750695	The Dark Glory War (A Prelude to the DragonCrown War Cycle)	Books	5	13	15	N	N	Stackpole at his best	The author certainly wastes no time in getting to the meat of the story.  To begin, we meet the three main characters, friends all going through a rite of passage at the same time, one a noble, another the son of a military man, the third a commoner.  Their passage to adulthood is interrupted by a monumental event, an invasion from an enemy of old from the north.  Having been in the right place at the right time, all three are thrust into an odyssey across their continent.  This serves the purpose of introducing the reader both to the varied cultures in this fantasy world, and to the varied races in this world.  Among the goodly races are humans, elves of a type to give a refreshing view of them, and a race of shapeshifters.  The evil races are headed by an evil sorceress, who controls gibberers, temeryces (feathered, sickle-toed fast running horrors), and giants.  The evil has lain dormant for a long time, choosing now to strike, when the populace has grown complacent.<br />Stackpole, as per his usual, deals with the politics of the various regions in regard to one another.  Character development is also very well done.  The three young men truly become the heroes of their generation.  Their journey takes them through many battles, all captured in exquisite detail.  While the good guys fare well, there are many extenuating circumstances that conspire to make them pyrrhic victories at best.<br />The story, told by one of the three as a memoir of sorts, ends with extensive setup for the upcoming trilogy, as it is intended.  This book has all the elements one might seek from a fantasy novel: action, intrigue, suspense, magic, even romance.  Stackpole as much as any other author can create characters that you just truly HATE, and others that you love like your own sibling.  If you like fantasy novels and would like something of a change of pace from the tried and true material that is already moldering out there, give this one a try.  You won't be sorry.	2002-04-26
US	49106448	RGBVBNCVRWEUB	0786918756	415392370	Elminster in Hell	Books	4	8	13	N	N	A devil's plaything	Weakened and trapped in hell after using his not inconsiderable power to repair a rift between the dark domain and his homeland of Toril, Elminster is captured by a powerful devil.  Tortured in unimaginable ways, the demon seeks to break Elminster and thus obtain his unique knowledge both of magic and of the Goddess of Magic, Mystra.<br />The story reads in many places like a group of mostly unrelated short stories, in the guise of Elminster's memories being viewed by the demon like some Saturday afternoon matinee.  Often, though, we return to the mental battle being waged between El and the devil.  It is overwhelmingly lopsided in the Hell-spawn's favor.  We also flash to scenes in Toril, where El is desperately trying to contact powerful friends, in the hope they may aid him.<br />This novel is another in the chronicle of the life of Elminster, having now moved from the distant past to more contemporary times in the current scheme of the Forgotten Realms.  Frequently do we see the mighty Elminster reduced to ignominious defeat, as would be nearly all of the well-known Realms heroes were they in a similar predicament.  We are given a relatively good versing in the politics of Hell, through the conversations between El and the Demon.  We also deal repeatedly with a demon that is apparently too foolish to realize what El is doing the whole time.  Also the demon constantly announces that he has had enough of El's distractions, only to allow himself to be distracted yet again.  This is probably the weakest point of the book, but it must be considered acceptable in light of the vast brilliance and wisdom of Elminster; being able to constantly deflect the devil could certainly be no easy feat.<br />I think that overall this is a good book, but that it is not as good as some of the earlier books in the series, where we were privy to the early years of the Realms' most reknowned wizard.	2001-09-27

But the forces of Chaos are well-prepared, and Gaunt suffers a disgrace.  Basically broken in terms of military command, Gaunt is given one last mission to redeem himself before beign forcibly retired and allowing the Ghosts to be dispersed.  He is to seek and recover a most important and ancient artifact.<br />This novel, as with all the Ghosts books to date, is filled with great amounts of carnage and violence.  But this is the depiction of a most unprecendented war, one in which the enemy has only a regard for madness and suffering, as well as a hatred of all that is stable.  And against this we have a single great leader, not only fighting the enemy, but dealing with jealousy and prejudice from different units and superior officers.  As he has done in the three previous books, Abnett lets us see new sides to almost all the characters.  This is a great talent, as the personalities never stagnate, and it keeps the reader interested.  I highly recommend this book, not only to Warhammer 40k players, but to any that like well-written science fiction.	2001-09-18
US	49106448	R336APLNBTTZ2G	0345442989	164434464	Star Wars: Cloak of Deception	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Political intrigue abounds in the Old Republic	In this novel, we see more of the high-calibre writing talent of James Luceno, who previously scripted two of the New Jedi Order (NJO) novels.  <br />Luceno does a masterful job of capturing the essence of characters that many will recognize, including the eventual Moff Tarkin, Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi (as a youth of course), and a host of others.  Other characters make appearances, including: Vergere, who seems to be playing a part in the NJO series, a Jedi Master named Cboath, a newly elected leader named Amidala, and two jedi whom we saw face Darth Maul in Shadow Hunter.  Luceno has done a great job of keeping the reader guessing on exactly what the eventual goal of the plot being hatched by dissidents really is.  Of course it turns out that Sidious has been orchestrating things very far in advance.  But we are also able to see the even Palpatine cannot plan EVERYthing, as he exhibits some doubts and slight apprehensions during the story.<br />The novel takes place some weeks before Shadow Hunter, and thence before Phantom Menace.  Luceno, as mentioned, did an excellent job in incorporating all those things we know to have taken place, but also in rounding out HOW they came about.  I think that this is an excellent lead-in to Phantom Menace, better than Shadow Hunter.  <br />I have read that many feel the book moves too slow.  Well, it may seem so, but for those with patience, it takes only a moment's thought to realize how much work went into planning the outcome.  It is clearly worth any perceived effort.  Much of what we see is political machinations, a great deal of course being orchestrated by Palpatine.  We are able to see how he was able to position himself to be the successor to the Chancellor's post.  <br />Much of the story also hinges upon the pursuit of some criminals by the Jedi, particularly Qui-Gon Jin.  We are able to see how he was unable to remove a momentary focus from his mind, as we know later proved to be his undoing.  There is also Jedi combaton a scale not appreciated before the NJO series, as we see a relatively large gathering of Jedi working in concert against a much numerically larger foe.  When you read this, you will know why the Jedi were so feared by criminal elements, and by Palpatine.<br />I don't know that I could give much more praise to this book than I have already.  I am sure that most Star Wars readers already have this one, but I would like to recommend this to those that may have been soured on Star Wars after Phantom Menace came out.  I know of many that claimed they did not understand what it was all about.  Well folks, here is the background that will answer your questions.	2001-09-18

It is a dark time for the Jedi, taking a large toll on their ranks. In accord with the Vong's demands, the Jedi are being rounded up and given as appeasement to the Vong. The view of the Jedi in the New Republic further deteriorates, as Luke and Mara have arrest warrants issued by the Senate. As in the previous books in this series, much focus is given to the younger Jedi, Jacen, Jaina, Anakin, and Tahiri, in particular. We also get a nice return in the presence of Corran Horn as he attempts to rein in two of the kids. There are also the requisite battle scenes between Jedi and Vong, although on a much lesser scale than earlier parts of the series. This is mostly due to the Vong maintaining the present state of the invasion and not furthering their conquest. A pivotal point of this book is Mara's plight. She learns that the synthesized medication she is taking is dangerous for her unborn child, so she must decide whether to save herself or her baby. I'm sure you can guess her chosen path. Her importance not only to Luke, but to the kids as well, is underscored very well in this respect. Another side quest is the search for a safe haven for the now-hunted Jedi, especially the children from the academy. Though we are not privy to the search itself, the nature of the chosen destination is revealed, and seems like a nice choice, given the pattern of Vong (and Republic) thought. I have to say that I recommend this book as a nice contribution to the NJO series. It seems to me that something big is building, and the crescendo is coming soon. If you like Star Wars, and especially any of the NJO series, you will appreciate this one too.	2001-08-25
US	49106448	RQXHQBTU1T27V	0743434668	944723848	Spiderman: Revenge of the Sinister Six	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A long wait, but definitely worth it	Finally we receive the second installment in the Sinster Six Trilogy.  This novel furthers the story begun in THe Gathering of the Sinister Six.  As might be expected, there are many fight scenes between Spidey and his enemies.  Especially good to read is the day-long series of battles orchestrated by the Six to occupy Spidey and SAFE while a peculiar theft is committed.<br />Castro gives us an excellent read.  He manages to capture the spirit of the comic book universe quite well, as good as any of the other Marvel Novel contributors.<br />Especially interesting is the search Peter Parker undertakes to verify the possibility of his having a long-lost older sister.  The reader is led to believe that she is in league with the Six (being, in fact, their sixth member) via association with the man who killed Peter's parents and psychologically dominates her.  This so-called Gentleman is a nice addition to the rogues' gallery of Spidey foes.<br />I really enjoyed this book, and for any Spider-man fan it should not disappoint.  There is my standard complaint that the events in the novels do not affect the course of action in the comic books, but there will always be such discrepancies.  Happy reading!	2001-08-20
US	49106448	R362SVX1ALET7U	0671876996	571919868	Forever After	Books	4	20	20	N	N	This last work of a great one is, well, great	In this last work of Roger Zelazny, he culled together a grouping of four absolutely top-notch authors for a collaborative effort.  Mike Stackpole, David Drake, Robert Asprin and Jane Lindskold each chronicle an individual quest of recently separated companions.  The quests are to return to safekeeping various magical items whose combined presence is tearing up the very fabric of reality.<br />Stackpole gives us the story of the loyal assassin and his mission to return a powerful amulet to its former resting place, now that it's use is no longer required.  In his quest for the most absolutely perfect ways of killing his enemies, the assassin has surpassed all others, confronting his former teacher in a climactic battle over ownership of the powerful item.  I personally feel this to have been one of Stackpole's best works, and on its merit alone is this book an excellent read.<br />David Drake gives us the story of an elf and a norse woman determined to rid themselves of a powerful ring.  They set out across a terribly desolate region to dispose of the ring, with incredible danger and death hounding them the whole way.  Personally I considered this the least of the stories -- I just could not get into it, although the dialogue between the questors and the ring is amusing at times.<br />Asprin provides the funniest of the stories, with a dragon's perspective of an encounter with a warrior.  You see, the warrior figures to get the dragon to guard the deadly sword he has been commissioned to dispose of.  The dragon has other ideas.  The solution to the dilemma is very nicely devised by the hero, as is the slight twist ending.  I really enjoyed this story.<br />Lindskold gives us the quest of the Army's best commander to return an ancient scroll from whence it came.  During the journey, various things arouse her suspicions as to the true motives behind the quests on which she and her erstwhile companions have been sent.  Realizing a great danger is building, she hastenshome to the upcoming wedding and coronation of the nation's newly acknowledged monarchs.<br />Preceding each story, and wrapping up the saga is a bridging story by Zelazny himself.  These stories form the backbone of the global picture, as it were.  In fact, these could almost be read as a well-written story unto themselves, with the intervening stories merely fleshing out the details.  Since that was the plan, it was carried off quite successfully.  I highly recommend this book, especially for those who enjoy slightly off-the-wall fantasy, as this book possesses that in spades.  Happy reading!	2001-08-18

But there is a problem.  The progression of the Foundation follows the Seldon Plan PRECISELY!  <br />Such absolute perfection rings to a select few as too unlikely to occur naturally.  Especially in light of the severe deviations in the past, as in the conquest by the Mule.  Even the Second Foundation, the guardians of the Plan are unable to explain the uncanny adherence.  The First Foundation believes this to be the result of the Second Foundation's influence.  The Second Foundation is uncertain as to who may be causing such undue influence.<br />So two individuals are sent on somewhat parallel missions.  One from the First Foundation, ostensibly to discover the location of the Second Foundation.  This mission quickly becomes a drive to locate Earth, the legendary planet of origin of mankind.  <br />The Second Foundationer's mission is to pursue this other man, as he seems to be indelibly entwined with the future of the Plan, despite the fact that Psychohistory is unable to predict the actions of an individual.  Further complicating this chase is the fact that the Second Foundation has been infiltrated, as evidenced by the distinct absence of specific information from all their databases.<br />This novel continues the drive by Asimov to link his Robot, Empire and Foundation Series.  We get several tantalizing references to some things that are not completed, leaving the door open to an obvious sequel.  The writing is classic Asimov, with sufficient twists to keep the reader entertained.  The ending is very much different from what might be expected at the outset, as the degree to which outside forces have interfered is vast.  Overall this is a good read, although it tends to drag in places.  As a continuation of the epic chronicle of future history, it is invaluable.	2001-08-14

Taking place in the future, for the most part anyway, these stories generally deal with Humans in conflict with alien races.  The stories are unrelated to one another, each being a separate universe unto itself.  The gamut of science fiction is pretty much handled, as there are uses of such things as: FTL travel, enhanced mental abilities, cybernetically enhanced humans, time-travel paradox-type situations. . .  None of these stories are found lacking in appeal, with the characters not totally flat as happens in many SF stories.  If you like science fiction with a military twist, I believe you will enjoy this collection.	2001-07-13

It is not common to find even a textbook with such well-detailed instructions from beginning level to advanced for a myriad of topics in the field.  Of course, there is a very significant focus on biological applications, so some portions of the book are not entirely relevant to materials science folks like myself.  This book covers the basics of optics, sample preparation, imaging, photography and film developing, and specifics about both TEMs and SEMs.  This book is a very good investment for anyone intending to perform work with such instruments.	2001-06-26

Imagine his surprise when he realizes that he has never been to his hometown!  Apparently his entire past has been implanted, and he is determined to discover the truth of his life.  <br />What follows is a VERY well-written tale in a very classic style.  He meets up with former associates who were happy with his amnesiac state.  They of course object most strenuously to his recovering memory, and they try to arrest his progress in increasingly lethal degrees.  Eventually they resort to kidnapping the only loved one Don has, and that is beyond tolerance.  <br />This novel is not very long, taking just a couple hours to read, but there are moany things that the authors foresaw (in 1982) that have more or less come to be, like universal access to facilities like banking from any computer outlet (one of the minor such cases).  He is aided by a very unique ability, the reason his associates fear him, that of a sort of machine telepathy.  He is able to send his consciousness into any electronic device.  This you can bet comes in very handy in such a technological (1994!) setting.  <br />I have only recently begun tracking down all of Zelazny's books, this being the third I have read, and I consider this to be a great novel.  There is good character advancement, well-written first-person perspective, and action without excessive gratuitous violence.	2001-06-20

Books	1	5	12	N	N	Not the Paranoia I know and love	Well, I sure hate to be so critical, but this book just could not get the job done.  For those who have played the Paranoia rpg, the setting is a humorous one in the near future, in which a Big Brother-like Computer controls the human populace.  When things go wrong beyond the Computer's ability to control, a Troubleshooting team is sent in to rectify the problem.  The results are usually quite amusing, as every team member is secretly a subversive, trying to overthrow the computer, and either do away with or frame his companions in the process.<br />This book, however, fails in attempting slap-stick humor.  Too many things happen at once, and the nature of the setting is not explained in an effective manner.  All the quirky machine screw-ups play as just plain stupid.  And the dialog between the team members and the citizens they encounter is worse than even the worst Paranoia session I ever played.<br />If you play and enjoy the Paranoia game, please steer clear of this book, as it might make you quit playing from sheer disgust.  If only it were possible to give a rating of less than one star.	2001-06-18

While I am unfamiliar with that game universe, the caliber of the authors presented here is nearly unparalleled, being culled from the top ranks of today's current SF producers.<br />While several of the stories are less notable than others, all take place in a region of our galaxy known as the Verge, outside the more populace, &quot;safe&quot; regions.  Thus can this setting be used for horror, SF, mystery, and the old favorite hack-and-slash.  In my opinion, there are examples of each of these, with some incorporating multiple aspects.  Overall, the stories are nicely character-oriented, as with all quality SF writings.

In the creation of his Foundation, Seldon also created a Second Foundation, whose location was only vaguely referred.  Its nature as uncertain as its location, finally are we given a view of this entity.  As in the previous Foundation books, this is not a single story but two individual stories.<br />The first story deals with the Mule, the Foundation-conquering mutant, and his search for the Second Foundation, the only thing barring him from universal domination.  Relentless in his search, an encounter is finally made, which is incredibly well-written and suspenseful.  Truly an excellent work of SF.<br />The second story takes place not terribly long after the first, and depicts yet another search for the elusive Second Foundation.  The stakes do not seem to be as high, but the eventual effect greater.  The Foundation has come to be complacent with regard to a certainty that its success is assured, especially with another Foundation out there keeping watch, as they believe.  Consequently, a malaise has settled over the citizenry, who believe there is no urgency to anything.  Some see this failing and seek to locate or disprove the existence of the other Foundation to either reinforce the belief or stimulate some activity.  And boy do we get taken on a fun ride.  Always keeping us guessing, as the clues lead us this way and that, it seems that Isaac always has the last laugh, as he keeps yanking the rug from under us.<br />As with the other preceding books in this series, I won't waste much space lauding the quality therein, for there has been enough said that I could not really be original.  But this entire series is highly recommended for any who enjoy true science fiction.  Happy reading!	2001-06-03
US	49106448	R32JE1O8UCM2MG	0553293370	834333861	Foundation and Empire	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Foundation Onward!	As in Foundation, this is actually not a single story.  Here are presented two separate episodes in the development of the Foundation toward the establishment of the Second Galactic Empire.<br />The first details the encounter between the growing Foundation and the still-very-powerful Empire.  At the forefront is an Imperial General of outstanding ability and charisma.  Unfortunately, Hari Seldon, the architect of the Foundation, predicted all this with his psychohistorical calculations.  While the general is very successful in his opposition to the Foundation, his very nature ensures his downfall.<br />The second story is quite ingenious, in that the single large failing of Seldon's psychohistory is brought to light.  An individual beyond the predictive nature of psychohistory has appeared and done the impossible.  While there is a type of mystery presented, Asimov either wanted the reader to know the answer before the characters, or he didn't try very hard to obscure the nature of things.  But this is a crucial moment in the Foundation's development, as they seem to be vulnerable after all.  This story depends heavily on a plot element present in all the Robot-Empire- and now Foundation Series:  psionic abilities.  Clearly this was a favorite concept for Asimov, and he never seems to abuse it;  that is, it never seems there for its own sake but always represents a fundamental encounter when it appears, and you can bet there are severe ramifications.<br />While I have noted a few complaints about the second of these two stories, this book is still very well written, with action and suspense as good as any I've read.  Asimov did such a wonderful job crafting this future history that I can only applaud having had the pleasure to read it.  If you like S-F, you will love this whole series, chosen as the Best Series Ever Hugo winner.  Need I say more?	2001-06-03
US	49106448	R35QJF8EILNGLA	0553278398	525478656	Prelude to Foundation (Foundation, Book 1)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	The Adventures of Hari Seldon	For readers of the original Foundation novels, this novel actually depicts Hari Seldon as a person, not as a God figure.  Really the best bridge between the Robot, Empire, and Foundation series, in this novel we are finally allowed to see Trantor, the Galactic Empire's capital, before the Empire's fall has truly begun.<br />Seldon, a mathematician, has developed a theory which in concept might be applied to predict the general outcome of events affecting humanity, but only on a very large scale.  But the theory is essentially useless -- impractical.  This failing is brought to light very early, and provides the drive for the story, as Hari tries to observe humanity so as to develop interpretive Laws to make his theory, Psychohistory, practicable after all.  <br />He proceeds to visit various locales of the planet, each region almost a world unto itself on the great city-world that is Trantor.  He is alternately pursued, assisted, and hampered by scheming factions in the Imperial structure.  <br />Asimov does provide us some info on the adventures of Seldon, but there are really no surprises in this book.  From the first meeting with some of the characters I had their nature identified.  Although Seldon is ignorant and very often surprised by the unsettling behavior of people he encounters, in keeping with his ignorance of humanity.  Seldon is presented almost like a country bumpkin gone to the city.  Nevertheless, having read the Robot and Empire novels (in the latter of which should this novel be counted, not purely as the first Foundation novel, in my opinion) this is a good bridge leading into the Foundation series.  If you have not read the Empire novels, nothing really would be lost, but some confusion may result from not reading the Robot novels first.  In fact, if the Robot series were not read, some of the obvious clues to which I earlier referred would not be caught.  In any case, this novel does a good job of presenting the problems with the Galactic Empire, which in my mind has many similarities to the Old Republic from Star Wars (A decrepit government ruled from a single large city-planet, e.g.), and thus leading very well into the Foundation series.	2001-06-03

The sole reason for this evasion rests in Sark's dominion over a no-account world called Florina.  No-account, that is, except for a wondrous crop that grows only upon Florina.  This crop is so entwined in the culture of the galaxy that Sark has become unbelievably wealthy, so much so that Trantor fears the large army to be raised by such wealth.  <br />Upon the planet Florina, there is a man whose memory has been erased for the danger it poses to the delicate balance that exists over Florina's condition.  In his profession he uncovered a secret now lost, one of paramount importance to the safety of all Florina.  <br />This novel chronicles the mystery surrounding this mind-wiped man and the adventures that ensue as his memory begins to return.  Asimov again displayed his excellent plotting ability as he leads you in various directions, so that you come to conclusions that are completely wrong, lest you recall the earlier-placed clues that would prevent such erroneous conclusions.  When the questions are all finally answered, too many viable suspects have been eliminated, and there is left only the guilty.  Asimov was successful in twisting the events such that any reader would be kept guessing.  <br />This book is the second of the three Empire novels, which depict different time periods in the creation of the Galactic Empire.  This takes place after the Empire is relatively well established.  Preceding these novels, but not necessary for any understanding (as Asimov did not tie them together until well after the Empire novels were published) of the events.  <br />Following the Empire novels are the Foundation novels, which chronicle the fall of the Empire.  In order to truly get the feel of this universe, this book clues the reader in as to how Trantor progressed in its Imperial goal.  Also, he provides information that indicate the state of things in the thirdEmpire novel, Pebble in the Sky.	2001-06-03

The fall of the Galactic Empire having been foreseen by the great Hari Seldon through his Psychohistory, a colony, of sorts, of scholars was established on a planet far from the center of the Empire.<br />This Foundation, as the colony is referred, is intended to limit the chaos sure to follow from the Empire's eventual fall.  Proceeding the fall, various small dominions erupt, and for a time the Foundation treads water as a neutral entity, but things soon come to a head, and action must be taken.  Unfortunately, scholars are not the best equipped to handle such situations.<br />From the outcome of these events, the political structure of the Foundation is altered, and from there again does a conflict occur.  As there was such a concentration of intellectual beings in the Foundation, there was no decline in technology as in the rest of the former Empire.  And so might superior technology aid in the well-being of the Foundation, as well as its regard from neighbors.<br />This book is actually several separate stories, taking place at different times in the early history of the Foundation, as the citizens try to fulfill the goal of Hari Seldon, now long dead, but nonetheless still influential.  These stories are very well written, and obviously had a great deal of thought put into them as to how the collapse and restoration of such an entity might proceed.  If you like REAL science fiction, I highly recommend this book, you won't regret it.	2001-06-03

A strange accident transports an innocent middle-aged man thousands of years into Earth's future from his native mid-twentieth century.  Earth is much-changed in this future, as a poisoned backwater world of no importance in the Galactic Empire.  The citizens of this Empire not even aware that Earth was the original home of humanity, despite that very assertion by Earth's inhabitants.  <br />An archaeologist seeks to end this dispute by visiting Earth to find proof one way or another about Earth's place in humankind's past.  And he happens to be visiting shortly after the arrival of our hapless 20th century American.  But things are not to be that easy.<br />This novel details the efforts of the archaeologist to solve the mystery, the travails of an unintentional time traveler adjusting to his fate, and the others they encounter.  Asimov also uses a plot element to be found in both the Robot Novels and the Foundation Novels:  Psionics, obviously a favorite concept of his.  <br />The storyline becomes entangled with the politicians of Earth and their feelings toward the Empire as a whole, especially their rancor at being despised by the Empire.  Unlike the previous two Empire Novels, this story does not read as a mystery.  Rather this novel is more an adventure in the future, with some romantic elements thrown in.  <br />Among the three Empire Novels, this is my favorite.  The story may start a bit slow, but once it picks up it does not slow down until the conclusion, where Asimov pretty much sums it up as one might see coming.  There was not really anything difficult to anticipate, but the concepts are wonderfully applied.  I recommend this book even if you have not read any of the other Empire Novels, as you will really not miss out on anything.	2001-06-03

This novel takes place about six years after The Phantom Menace, with Anakin apprenticed to Obi-Wan Kenobi, and being quite a handful.  It doesn't help that Kenobi is himself so young.  <br />The precocious Anakin, constantly fracturing the customs of the Jedi Temple, has been assigned a test, despite his youth.  He and Obi-Wan are to travel to a non-aligned world famed for producing the best ships in the galaxy.  Their objective is two-fold:  Obtain one of these ships, and determine the fate of a fellow jedi sent to the same planet.  For readers of The New Jedi Order (NJO) series, the identity and fate of this Jedi should be obvious.  In this respect, the mystery of the same presented in the NJO novels is solved.  <br />Arriving at the planet, the two Jedi are pursued by an up-and-coming Republic military officer named Tarkin, who should also be well known to Star Wars afficionados.  Tarkin's goal is also to obtain the secret of the manufacture of such superior ships.  We see the same ruthlessness in this man as we might expect from his actions in A New Hope.  <br />Anakin and Obi-Wan learn many things of the unique culture of this Rogue Planet, which has recently repulsed a very powerful invading force, whose methods and actions should further ring familiar to NJO readers.  It is in preparation for the return of the same or equally powerful invaders that the planet has begun preparations to safeguard its independence for the future.  The nature of these preparations are relatively obvious to the reader, but not so obvious to the characters until put into use.  <br />In the course of the mission, we are given audience to the beginnings of Anakin's descent into the Dark Side, as well as meeting several familiar old faces.  But the revelations are limited in scope, as there must be restrictions on what can be included in these &quot;historical&quot; Star Wars novels.  That is the only reason for this novel not receiving 5 stars.  It just wasn't difficult to solve the mystery of the planet, and we really didn't learn a terribly great amount of any particular characters, other than Anakin and Obi-Wan.  And what we are given is just sparse enough to be unstaisfying.  But we do see the foreshadowing of things we know come to pass, as intimated by Tarkin in reference to the future of the Republic leadership. <br />Despite these slight criticisms, this is a great read with a good amount of action without being gratuitous.  And, hey, it's a Star Wars novel, how could you go wrong?	2001-05-27

A student near to graduating is suddenly thrust into danger as a bomb is discoverd in his closet.  It becomes clear that it must have been placed by the same faction that arranged for the death of his father, a prominent political figure.  <br />This young man is thus forced to flee Earth and seek assistance from a contemporary of his father, one who may be able to offer him asylum from his pursuers.  Of course, though, Asimov makes sure that things in life are never easy, as we can all relate.  Refused assistance, he must flee still further, with the skein becoming more tangled as the chase proceeds.  <br />Eventually, he deduces the murderer's identity, and a confrontation must follow.  The result helps set the stage for a human Galactic Empire, begun in Robots and Empire, in which the source of Earth's radioactive nature was initiated, paving the way for galactic colonization, and in fact forcing humans to leave Earth as it became more uninhabitable.  It is interesting that Asimov was able to incorporate all three of his epic series into a single long narrative of future history.  <br />As the first Empire novel, this book is nevertheless not the most necessary for continuity of the storyline, but it is still worth the read.	2001-04-30

The intervening years have seen a vast and continuing expansion of Earth people into new worlds.  These new inhabitants are called Settlers, and are reviled by the venerable Spacers, with the feeling being mutual.  Dr. Fastolfe, who favored the Earth colonization effort, has recently died, but his enemies live on.  And a peculiar crisis has arisen.<br />On the planet Solaria, since abandoned by those who called the world home, there remains a vast robot population, without human masters.  A Settler ship approaches the Spacer world of Aurora with a request to &quot;borrow&quot; Gladia, the only known Solarian whose location is certain.  It is the Settlers' belief that only she might be able to assist them with their problem, that of humans being murdered on Solaria, BY ROBOTS!  As the First Law should never allow such to occur, all sides are uncertain how to proceed.<br />Gladia indeed does accompany the Settler mission, along with her loyal robots Daneel and Giskard.  The realization that the Solarians when abandoning their planet arranged so that no other humans were to be tolerated becomes certain, despite the seeming contradiction.  <br />Surviving the initial mission, Gladia is then taken on a triumphal tour of sorts, as her association with the Settler-worshipped Elijah makes her an idol to the Settlers, who can scarcely believe her to be the same woman known to have been a contamporary of Elijah.  Also, despite the hatred of the Settlers for robots (as associated with Spacers), Daneel and Giskard are permitted, for similar reasons, though still openly despised.  <br />Her tour takes her to Earth, where a clandestine mission by those Auroran elements who hate Earth and the Settlers is nearly to fruition.  And only Daneel and Giskard are free and knowledgeable enough to investigate the matter.<br />It is this mission and its result that really tie in the Robot,Empire, and Foundation series.  This novel detailed the causes of several previously mysterious states mentioned in those farther future series.  Asimov again showcased his plotting ability, while being careful to not contradict those occurences known in the later novels.  As an end to the Robot series, there remains a large mystery to be solved, paving the way for future efforts.	2001-04-30

But the new worlds' residents, the Spacers, are not in thrall of Earth, rather they hold Earth by the throat.  Now, in the one Spacer locale on the homeworld of humanity, a prominent spacer has been murdered.   Tasked with capturing the murderer, Elijah Baley, a resident of the largest human City, essentially large hives mostly underground, must team with a human-appearing robot to solve the crime.  Robots, however, are not very well regarded on Earth at this time, so Elijah must overcome his own bias in order to work effectively with Robot Daneel Olivaw.   The book details many of the conditions of overpopulated Earth and the eternally enclosed humans, who now have an unreasoning fear of the outdoors.  The politics between the Spacers and the native Earthmen is also discussed in detail. Overall, this is a very well-balanced story which begins the robot series, continuing from the basis Asimov set in his collection Robot stories in I, ROBOT.	2001-04-24

Another Spacer has been murdered, but not on Earth this time, on the newest colonized Spacer world, Solaria.  Solaria is the antithesis of Earth, having a VERY lopsided robot to human ratio, while on Earth, robots are still despised and distrusted.  Teaming again with R. Daneel Olivew, his investigative partner from Caves of Steel, Baley must deal with not only his own aversion to the vast robot presence, but the frequent travels through the outdoors, which his agoraphobic mind can scarcely tolerate.  In addition is the nature of the Solarians, who have become so isolated from each other as to consider obscene the actual presence of humans.   Meeting resistance constantly, from the Solarians and from his own partner, Baley begins to see that the Solarian way is just as bad as the Earth way, where the people are not isolated from each other, but from the galaxy.  Eventually, after pursuing several wrong leads, Baley hits upon the truth, but it's not quite as one might expect. I highly recommend this as another great Asimov novel;  as part of the Robot-Empire-Foundation storyline, it's a very good part.	2001-04-24

The prominent roboticist who created the humaniform robots is accused by his political nemesis of a very serious crime.  Once again, he calls upon Elijah Baley, the now galactically-reknowned police detective from Earth.  And once again, Baley must travel to another Spacer world, where by his very Earth-nativity, he is treated with hostility.  Again, Asimov sheds light on the dichotomy of the Earth and Spacer cultures, where reliance on robots on the Spacer worlds has made them weak in a sense, while the human aversion to anything robotic has also failed in its prejudice. At stake is the very future of the Earth natives ability to expend outward as they once did to found the Spacer worlds, a future very much opposed by the majority of the Spacer populace.  If Baley fails to exonerate the accused, then the reactionary elements of Aurora's political entity will prevent any Earth colonizations. Again, Baley teams with R. Daneel Olivaw to solve the mystery.   It was this novel in which first we began to see Asimov tying together his three marked series:  Robot, Empire, and Foundation.  Again, as with the previous two Robot novels, Asimov shed more light on the nature of humanity after expansion into space, while setting the groundwork for the far-flung future of his following series.	2001-04-24

In this episode, the Jedi Academy on Yavin 4 is threatened, and with no help forthcoming from the New Republic Government, due to apathy and antipathy toward the Jedi.  <br />Refusing the orders to the contrary, Anakin takes it upon himself to ensure the safety of his fellow Jedi.  But he arrives a mite too late.  Marooned on a planet with essentially no help, we see him in a life-or-death challenge to rescue his best friend.  Encountering unexpected allies and gaining new insights into both the alien invaders and himself, Anakin blazes a new branch in the trail of the New Jedi Order.  <br />For those who like the concept of a guerrilla-like scenario, this book is excellent, as Anakin must rely on his wits and improvisation to survive.  The reader is exposed to new nuances of the Yuuzhan Vong political structure, as well as their Shapers, those who engineer new life-forms for specific purposes.<br />Keyes does a fine job of conveying the desperation of the Jedi, as well as the aloofness of Fey'Iya, and the contempt of the Vong.  Anakin risks much, his life, the lives of others, treading near the dark side, and is changed as a result.  To know exactly how, you'll need to read it, and it's a fun ride.	2001-04-07

Any person who can write such gripping SF, as well as mysteries, non-fiction, and textbooks, is to be acknowledged as a true master, as was Isaac Asimov. This collection of his first robot stories, which paved the way for the Robot series, are essential to anyone intending to read that series.   Each story is a small mystery unto itself, with the humans tasked with characterizing the errant bahavior(s) of certain robots, which may or may not be obeying Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics (Robotics, by the way, being a term coined BY Asimov himself), delving into the very nature of Robots to determine the errors.  Thus is the reader educated on the foundation of Robotics in Asimov's Universe.  Each story is very clever, and showcased Asimov's wit and talent in the genre. It is really tough to find good competition for a work of this caliber.	2001-03-06

Blending well with the previous (Luceno) installments of the New Jedi Order series, Tyers continues the road to redemption of Han Solo, as well as fleshing out the role that the Solo children play in the Yuuzhan Vong invasion.  As a chapter in that storyline, this is an essential read.<br />While not quite as good as those of Stackpole, the battle scenes are very good, without being there just for their own sake.  They are also not drawn out, which is often a problem with other books, where the story itself may be lacking.  Just to clarify:  this story is not lacking in any way.  All the major players are in the story, with most receiving specific attention.  Jacen Solo especially plays a large part.<br />In an effort not to reveal anything crucial and ruin it for you, some of the occurrences in this novel have me hopping around in impatience to see how they will be resolved in the next book.  <br />Now I know that all you fellow Star Wars die-hards have probably bought this one anyway, but for those that are not stalwart fans, you might become so by reading this book.	2001-02-26

Finally are we able to learn something of the life of Darth Maul.  Taking place immediately before the beginning of The Phantom Menace, we follow the efforts of Darth Maul to prevent the premature exposure of the Sith.  <br />Reaves combines action, suspense, and often humor, into an effortless, fast read.  As the story takes place in the bowels of Coruscant, we see some of the incongruities of the Republic government, and the Jedi.  We also get a few tantalizing glimpses of Darth Sidious, as he directs the actions of Maul in his pursuit.  <br />The battles are very nicely written, without being overdone, and letting us into the mind of Maul, with his contempt for the Jedi, and basically all non-Sith.  I had a few minor complaints about this book, but to discuss them would be to reveal essential events in the story.<br />I do recommend this book to all Star Wars enthusiasts, assuming you haven't already got this one.  If you're waiting for paperback, you still want to remember to get this one.  It reads fast, like all the Star Wars books -- you just can't put it down!	2001-02-26

As with many authors involved in multiple projects, Salvatore's Forgotten Realms works have been declining in quality as he must be spread too thin.  This is very evident considering what we have come to expect after the Icewind Dale and Dark Elf Trilogies.  Every book since those six has been worse than the previous.  This newest effort continues his work at fleshing out the other characters of the series, reversing the downward trend, and being of high quality again.  Here we see Jarlaxle and Entreri struggling against the machinations of the Drow and the Crystal Shard, with new incites provided into their pasts and motivations.  This book was a vast improvement over the last few novels, and I recommend it highly.  However, as you might read in all the other reviews, Drizzt is once again absent, but it's still an excellent read.  No one can bring to life a combat scene as well as Salvatore, and he shows it many times here.	2001-01-27

While I feel that Friedman is an excellent author, this book was very weak.  The story is a  continuation of one from the very early history of the X-Men, which  apparently wasn't quite resolved.  For those not well-versed in X-Men  knowledge (if there are any who would be buying an X-Men book), this might  be a difficult read, as there is very little background given for the  characters.  Also, there is essentially no character development and the  plot was rather weak.  Also, while not the most important aspect, there  were numerous and repeated spelling  (The country is spelled  C-o-l-o-m-b-i-a, not C-o-l-u-m-b-i-a!  Come on!) and grammar errors.  No  offense, but when I shell out for a hardback book, it would be nice if  someone had proofread it.
