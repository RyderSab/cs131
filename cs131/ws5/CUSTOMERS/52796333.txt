The author painstakingly recreates the events leading up to the murders, the media coverage to rival that of the OJ trial, the trial itself, and the subsequent appeals.  You can tell the author did her homework.  Each chapter is filled with footnotes that provide not only the source of the information, but at times additional facts about the time period, the city, and the mores of the time.  It was fascinating to read about a city I visit regularly and recognize some of the places mentioned.<br />However, the most fascinating part of this book was the trial itself.  The media circus surrounding the trial was phenomenal; the 3 major newspapers took turns printing sensational accounts of the murder, the trial, and the defendant as well as out and out lies in the form of forged letters and false testimonies of people involved in the case.  Additionally, the differences between trial procedure and proper behavior then and now are astounding.  For example, in the trial, jurors actually stood up and asked questions of the witnesses.<br />The only negative comment I have is that the author waited until the very end of the book to discuss the possible reason behind the murders.  Granted, this was her opinion (though backed by facts) so I can understand why she placed it outside the narrative of events from murder to trial, but it was frustrating at times to read the story without any idea why these murders occurred.<br />Despite this one drawback, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in mysteries, history, and human behavior.	2002-04-18

We would weave different designs and give them to each other as gifts.  It was so much fun.<br />My best friend's daughter is turning 8, and when I saw this book, I knew this would be perfect for her.  She is creative and loves jewelry.  This book is the perfect starter kit for making friendship bracelets.  Along with step by step instructions with illustrations for making simple to complex patterns, this book also provides a handy measuring guide and all the supplies needed to make many plain and beaded friendship bracelets.  A variety of colored floss and beads (including blue, red, green, pink, white, and black) means that just about every taste is covered.<br />I highly recommend this product as a gift for any creative or crafty girl (or boy)!	2002-04-06

According to the legend, \\"In every generation there is a Chosen One. She alone will stand against the vampires, the demons and the forces of darkness. She is the Slayer.\\"  The Slayer is a girl, usually in her late teens, who has superior strength, fighting, and healing abilities and uses those abilities to fight vampires and demons.  When one Slayer dies, the next is called.<br />This collection of short stories tells the tales of some of those slayers.  From a Slayer in Ancient Greece to a young African-America Slayer in 1950s Florida, each story details a portion of these girls' short lives as the Slayer.  Written mainly by genre novelists, the majority of these stories are well-written and range from humorous to chilling to poignant.  <br />Some of the stories are particularly touching such as my favorite story, \\"A Good Run,\\" which tells of a Greek Slayer in 490 BC who must protect a messenger during the first marathon, the Battle of Marathon between the Greeks and the Persians.  The story follows the thoughts of this Slayer as she runs along with the messenger, protecting him from evil as he heads toward Sparta to ask for the support of Spartan troops for Athens.<br />The only downside to this collection is that Slayers rarely live long lives so many of the stories deal with the death of these Slayers.  Some are particularly depressing or horrible such as in \\"Die Blutgrafin\\" and \\"Silent Screams.\\"<br />I recommend \\"Tales of the Slayer\\" to anyone who is, was, or will be a fan of \\"Buffy, the Vampire Slayer.\\"  It can also be enjoyed by fans of vampire stories or the fantasy genre since, as long as you know the premise, the stories will make sense even to someone who has never seen an episode of \\"Buffy.\\"  This book is labelled \\"Volume1\\"; I sincerely hope that \\"Volume 2\\" is in the works.	2002-02-07

Farscape fans have grown to expect stunning and intriguingly plotted episodes, amazing actors, and fantastic sets and special effects.  As we're currently in a long, long drought before the next new episodes here in the US, I picked up a copy of &quot;House of Cards&quot; to help get me through.<br />In &quot;House of Cards,&quot; the characterizations are pretty good, the pop-culture humor of the main character, earth-man John Crichton, is evident, and the plot works well enough.  While spending time on a Las Vegas-type planet, Rygel loses Moya in a card game and the crew must perform a variety of tasks to pay off the debt.  These tasks actually mask a more sinister purpose(of course).  All the while, John can't seem to remember the words to &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; and is driving everyone nuts singing the chorus over and over again, out loud, to try to jog his memory.<br />However, &quot;House of Cards&quot; is a slight novel.  It's only 224 pages, but it's worth a read, especially if you, like I, are in rerun hell.	2002-02-07

In the fourth and, so far, longest installment in the Harry Potter saga, we join Harry, Hermione, and Ron as they attend the World Cup of Quidditch and start their 4th year of wizard training at Hogwarts.<br />Thrust into the competition of the Triwizard Tournament through the machinations of an unknown foe, Harry must face not only the challenges of the contest itself, but also the temptation to give up, to give in to offers to help him cheat, and to his own renewed celebrity.  Harry comes up against tougher puzzles, scarier foes, and a tragedy that hits close to home.<br />JK Rowling has done it again as she tells the next tale of Harry Potter and doesn't shy away from tough situations and tough decisions for her characters who don't always make the right decisions but do try their best.  I've read this book twice, and each time it makes me cry a little and laugh out loud.  I highly recommend each of the Harry Potter stories.	2002-02-07

As we share an interest in anthropology and have visited some of the sites in New Mexico mentioned in this book, she thought I would enjoy it. And I did! This book is part travelogue, part archaeology text, and part collection of legends, folktales, and any odd theories he comes across. The mix makes for interesting reading. Childress is intelligent and well-informed but quirky as well. His observations on people he meets and life in the places he visits are at times insightful, funny, and strange.  <br />The only warning I'd give is that the books published by Adventures Unlimited tend to be poorly edited so don't be surprised to find some spelling and grammar errors present.  Still, these errors didn't detract from my enjoyment of \\"Lost Cities of North and Central America.\\"<br />This isn't a serious academic text, but it's quite informative,  an excellent read, and lots of fun!	2002-02-05

Olivia is a precocious, intelligent, and very imaginative young pig. In this book she is called on to share her weekend activities with her class. She describes an amazing day at the circus filled with spills, thrills, and all manner of exciting derring-do as Olivia saves the day when all the circus performers are out sick. If you like the Eloise books, try Olivia; you'll like her.<br />I recently saw my nephew, and he insisted on bringing the book out and \\"reading\\" it to me. He loves the book so much that he has asked to have it read to him before bed almost every night. He knew whole passages by heart and recited them to me word for word. It was so much fun listening to him so excited over a book.<br />Reading to your kids is a sure way to help them develop language skills. That, and it's so much fun!	2002-01-23

The idea of a vampire who can resurrect after being staked is intriguing to this fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  This book examines the idea in a much more effective way than the odd season 5 premiere episode &quot;Buffy vs. Dracula.&quot;  The story is well-written; Christopher Golden does a great job developing the plot including throwing in historical sections which give the reader a view into Veronique's experiences over the centuries.  There's also a sub-plot about Buffy's mom being ill which curiously foreshadows events of last season.<br />Now for the &quot;but&quot; part, so to speak.  While the idea is interesting and well-developed, this whole book is a bit more gory than other Buffy novels I've read, and it ends on a depressing note.  I still recommend it if you are a fan of the series.  I tend to read these during summer hiatus when I am Buffy-deprived.	2001-09-25

My first encounter with Bill Bryson was through &quot;Made In America&quot; (also highly recommended) his everyman's guide to the history of the English language in America.  I found Bryson to be intelligent, funny, and down-right readable.  I followed up with &quot;Mother Tongue&quot; which wasn't as funny as &quot;Made in America&quot; but equally as informative and a pleasure to read.<br />I then picked up &quot;A Walk in the Woods.&quot;  I just couldn't get &quot;into&quot; this book.  Bryson's style was different from the other books I'd read, and I found it not quite as compelling.  A couple of months ago I picked up this book and started reading it.  It is similar in tone and style to &quot;A Walk in the Woods,&quot; but this time, I found myself intrigued.  Maybe it's the subject matter, or maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this type of book when I tried to read &quot;A Walk in the Woods.&quot;<br />Regardless, I highly recommend &quot;In a Sunburned Country.&quot;  If you like to travel, or just armchair travel, if you find new cultures and countries fascinating, if you like to learn little-known and quirky facts about people and places, I'm sure you will enjoy this book, no worries.	2001-09-18

In The Lion In The Valley, we meet up with Amelia Peabody and her husband, Radcliffe Emerson as they set out once again for a dig in Egypt.  Their son Ramses, a &quot;catastrophically precocious&quot; 8 year old with an eerie aptitude for languages both ancient and modern, accompanies them for only the 2nd time and promptly gets himself kidnapped.  He is rescued almost immediately, but that isn't the end of their misfortune.  Mishaps continue to plague their dig, and the hand of the Master Criminal once more appears to be present.<br />If you haven't read any of this series yet and you don't want to start all the way at the beginning, this is a good place to start.  There's enough coverage of the past stories so you won't get lost without being repetitive for those who have read the 3 previous books.  A great story with wonderful characters, I highly recommend it.	2001-07-09

This book not only helped me to realize that I was wasting my life wishing I could go travel instead of traveling but that I could certainly do it alone.  Thalia Zapatos gives good, practical advice about traveling alone (or with a companion-including a great quiz for helping figure out yours and your companion's traveling styles) with sensible attention to safety issues without being alarmist.<br />What puts this book above and beyond your basic to do list type books is the inclusion of great anecdotes and short essays by women(including the author) recalling trips they've taken. These demonstrate the usefulness of the author's advice and humanize it as well.	2001-05-09

This devastatingly frightening condition is no match for Monk though; his deep-seated instincts, which made him a formidable police detective (as he learns is his profession), lead him to slowly figure out, little by little, who he is and allow him solve a brutal murder.<br />Anne Perry provides a good mystery with a twist. I really liked the way she provided insight into Monk's thought process, fear and confusion while trying to discover all he can about himself. <br />I gave this book four stars instead of five only because I guessed ahead of time a significant plot point; however, this book is still a four star novel because I was surprised by the ending and was very impressed and fascinated by the way Perry introduces her characters, lets us get one impression of each, and then provides more in-depth information and personality development.<br />This book will pull you right in!	2001-05-02

Not all of them were great, but this book is phenominal.  The story deals with hurt people; people damaged by their own actions trying to somehow live their lives without doing any more damage.  So what do they do?  They isolate themselves emotionally.  The mystery at the center of the plot isn't all that baffling.  The best part of this book is the way Hoffman gives us tiny glimpses into the characters' souls.  I read this book over the course of two winter days, but I could feel the heat and humidity of Verity as well as the desperate desire, fear, and determination of the two main characters.	2001-04-25

The movie took the characters' names, some of their personality traits, and a couple of plot lines and mixed them up into an unrecognizable parody of this amazing book.  That's not to say the movie was all bad.  I might have liked it more if I hadn't read this book first and loved it so much.<br />Practical Magic tells the story of the Owens' women whose bad luck with men is notorious.  It would be difficult to give a short summary of the plot since it is interjected with little anecdotes from the lives of ancestors, the girls who grow up(Sally and Gillian) under their aunts' (more or less) care, and Sally's daughters.<br />As usual, Hoffman paints the tale with beautiful descriptions and a wonderful narrative.  One of my favorite parts is the the description of the lilacs and the effect they have on other people in the town.<br />I highly recommend this book.  Not all of Hoffman's books are as good, but this is one of her best.  See my review of &quot;Turtle Moon&quot; as well.	2001-04-25

No sooner had I finished it when I bought the next 2 in the series.<br />The Curse of the Pharoahs is the 2nd book in the Amelia Peabody series.  Amelia is back, as witty, smart, and wryly humorous as ever working with husband Emerson to solve a purported case of a pharoah's curse.  The plot is convoluted enough to keep you guessing but not to lose you in the middle and the satellite characters are, as usual, well-fleshed out with their own quirks and personalities.  This book introduces one of my favorite secondary characters, Kevin O'Connell a reporter for the rag sheet, The Daily Yell.<br />Peters includes a good helping of Egyptian history and archaeology weaving it deftly through the well-plotted mystery.	2001-04-18

However there are so many more stories than the few presented in fairy tale books or in the recent tv mini-series.  I decided I wanted to read all of the stories.<br />I did some research into different translations and versions.  I chose this one because it was a new translation and the translator was of Middle-Eastern origins.  Haddaway explains in the introduction how his style of writing, the sentences structure, and word choice reflect the cadence and style of the stories he heard told as a boy growing up.<br />The language is beautiful, well written, and very funny.  There is the occasional problem with vague pronoun use, but English pronouns can be very tricky for non-native speakers (and for native speakers as well).  These problems are few and far between and don't detract from the stories.  I highly recommend this edition of The Arabian Nights.	2001-04-18

I had looked at this book a number of times before buying it...I can't believe I waited so long!  I am now completely hooked on Amelia Peabody.  She is a heroine for all ages.<br />Set in 1884, Crocodile on the Sandbank presents the first person account of Amelia Peabody, 32, unmarried and independent after inheriting her father's estate. Amelia is sharp, witty, wryly humorous, and very intelligent.  She sets off on an adventure travelling from her home in England through Europe to Rome where she comes to the rescue of Evelyn Barton-Forbes.  Abandoned and penniless Evelyn is humbled but she still maintains her common sense and courage.  The two immediately hit it off, and Evelyn becomes a companion to Amelia as they set off for Egypt.<br />Once in Egypt, the two meet the Emerson brothers, archaeologists working on a dig in Amarna.  The four join forces to contend with grave-robbers, the ever present Egyptian sun and wind, and a mysterious mummy stalking them by night. <br />Laugh-out-loud funny in parts, romantic (though not romance-novel-esque), as well as thrilling and suspenseful, Crocodile on the Sandbank combines the best of mystery, history, and great characters.  I have since read every one of the Amelia Peabody books and am anxiously awaiting the new one coming out May 1st.	2001-04-18

In the previous books we've seen her acumen for mysteries and archaeology and she just keeps improving her investigation and excavation skills in this 3rd book in the series.<br />You are also reacquainted with Radcliffe Emerson(her husband, intellectual equal, and true partner).  Their son, Walter Peabody Emerson (known as Ramses) comes along with them on the dig where he acquires a highly intelligent Egyptian brindled cat whom he promptly names Bastet after the Egyptian cat goddess.  Ramses is extremely precocious, very funny, singularly stubborn, and always trying to find the loophole in his parents' edicts.  He is a great contribution to the cast.  We still get to see the great relationship between Emerson and Peabody (as they affectionately refer to each other) as well as their interaction with Ramses.<br />Amelia doesn't seem like a very demonstrative mother, but her love for her son is there.  She's the kind of person who takes for granted that her family knows she loves them and prefers to show it through actions instead of words.  (In the latest couple of additions to this series, we see her affection come out into the open more.)<br />Once again, Peters provides an intriguing mystery along with more great information on the early days of Egyptian archaeology and Ancient Egyptian culture.  I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 because I got lost a couple of times and had to go back and trace some of the story elements more than once in order to follow what was going on with the mystery.  However, that does not mean this wasn't a great book.	2001-04-18

Imagine in a time without computers searching through millions of books and documents for the earliest known record of a particular word, creating a comprehensive definition for the word, and providing examples of its use...all by hand, all organized without the aid of a database--a thing without which most businesses today would not be able to function.<br />If you love to read, are a history buff, or just find insights into real human beings interesting, you must read The Professor and the Madman.	2001-03-30

Lisa Goldstein has created an intersting world connecting up the various subways in cities around the world. She also brings in Egyptian mythology, children's literature, and literary archetypes as parts of her Nefer Lands(Netherworld).  The only weak aspect was her trying to tie in what seemed like all great children's literature.  I could see a connection to some, but not all of the books mentioned.<br />In all though, it's a pretty good story.  The characters are interesting and fleshed out enough to make them sympathetic protagonists or effective antagonists.  <br />Two years ago I bought and read Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman.  There are obvious parallels between that book and Dark Cities Underground.  I enjoyed both and would recommend both, but I feel that Neverwhere is the superior book.<br />DCU is a bit thin.  Much is written of the build up to the main characters realizing that something else is down there underground, but there just isn't the development of the underground world the way there is in Neverwhere.  I also liked the characters in Neverwhere a bit better.<br />Read both books and see what you think.	2001-02-14

Beauty is no longer a two dimensional fairy-tale heroine.  Beauty is intelligent, loves learning, and riding her horse.  When her family's fortunes take a turn for the worse, she shows her strenght, taking on much of the hard work forced upon her family by their financial downfall.  She isn't perfect; occasionally she complains, she can be stubborn and willful, but she is more real than Beauty has ever been.<br />The supporting character are created with as much loving care.  No cardboard cutouts of selfish sisters or a bumbling father.  Each character is drawn with meticulous care.<br />Buy this book, read it, read it to your kids, or your spouse, or even your grandmother.  You won't regret it.	2001-02-10

It's a fascinating book, many-layered, and complex enough to challenge the reader.  When I first picked it up, I certainly wasn't expecting all the philosophy involved, but I love to learn, and this was a great introduction to the subject.  The storyline falls apart a bit at the end, but perhaps that is intentional, maybe to reflect the chaos of one's mind trying to create sense from all of the conflicting philosophical theories.  I highly recommend it.	2001-02-10

I don't have any conscious memory of specific expectations when I began reading this book, but the unintentional comparison was there.  Sophie's World was thought-provoking, a work of genius.  <br />The Solitaire Mystery is worth reading, there's no doubt of that.

It is one of my favorites; I've probably read it at least 12 times.<br />&quot;Rose Daughter&quot; didn't have the variety of characters nor the excellent narrative that &quot;Beauty&quot; does.  Sometimes the story got confused and at other times it dragged a bit.

Incredibly imaginative with wonderfully detailed elements, Neil Gaiman creates a whole world from the names associated with the London Underground.  Having visited London in 1997 and ridden on the Underground many times, I recognized many of the place names Gaiman used to create his fantastic world of London Below.<br />Our reluctant hero, Richard Mayhew assists a young woman, Door, whom he find hurt on the street little knowing what is in store for him.  His contact with the world of London Below sets in motion a series of events which changes Richard's life forever.  First, the world of London Above (his world) suddenly refused to acknowledge his existence.  No one recognizes him, they forget his name as soon as he introduces himself, his apartment is rented out, his desk is cleared away.  Richard goes looking for Door for an explanation, and that is just the beginning of the adventure.<br />Three words only:  Read this book!	2001-01-09

The Eloise books are true classics of American children's literature.  However, their appeal isn't limited to children.  Far from it, many adults, teens, and children alike all love Eloise.<br />If you haven't read the Eloise books, you simply must.  It's absolutely essential!	2001-01-09

As an Eloise fan and a dedicated Travel-buff, this book is a perreniel favorite.<br />My sister and I had a battered copy that had belonged to my mom.  Little did we know that it was a first edition.  Unfortunately, with the cover missing and many of the pages creased and loose, it certainly didn't look like much.<br />That didn't matter to us, all the pages were still there, and we read that book, along with Eloise and Eloise in Moscow, over and over again.  How happy I was to see that these books have been re-printed.	2001-01-09

The next time I came across it was Pamela Dean's inventive adaptation of the legend for Terry Windling's Fairy Tale series (again see my review).  The Perilous Gard is another fine reworking of this legend.<br />My email group was discussing fairy tales and fairy tale adaptations and a member mentioned this book after my post regarding the books above.  I purchased it and read it.  What a wonderful story.  I'm always pleased to see strong female characters.  For years while growing up, all I had the opportunity to read in school was books with male protagonists.  That's not to say that I didn't enjoy these books, but the chance to read books with female protagonists, and strong, capable women or girls at that, is a pleasure.<br />It's funny, after purchasing this book, I found out that I had read another of Pope's books &quot;The Sherwood Ring.&quot;  I read it ages ago and enjoyed it very much.	2001-01-09

I have seen too many HTML guides that are page after page of straight text with few illustrations and no examples.  Now these are fine if you're just interested in theory, but what if you want something to get you started coding HTML?<br />At the recommendation of a friend I purchased this book.  Within a few weeks of using this book, I felt very comfortable coding and editing HTML WITHOUT any kind of WYSIWYG editor (Frontpage, Composer).  I started creating all my HTML pages using notepad or wordpad.  I figured out how to do some simple style sheets, tables, text editing, all kinds of links, images, etc.<br />The book is set up like this:  First it's organized into chapters by topic.  Each chapter contains a number of new things to learn.  Each section, such as &quot;Using Background Color (page 98)&quot; contains a short intro paragraph (usually no more than a few sentences), step by step written instructions, tips, plus two illustrations, one of the code and one of the output of that code.  The book also contains a very thorough index, color chart, html tag list, and compatibility guide.<br />If you want to learn the basics of HTML this book is just the thing.  It will take you through the whole process from planning, through design and building your site, to publishing it.	2001-01-09

I found this book, part of-and perhaps the best of- Terri Windling's Fairy Tale series, at the local bookstore and bought it, took it home, and read it in a weekend. I couldn't put it down.  I've read it a number of times since.<br />The plot itself works the Tam Lin legend (included in ballad form in the book)into the like of a young woman attending a small midwestern liberal arts college.  Janet enters school as an English major(I was an English major in college) where she finds friends in her roomates and romance in a bumpy relationship with a Classics major.<br />For anyone who loves literature, this book also has an added appeal, Pamela Dean recommends many, many books, plays, and poems through the character of Janet.  Some were books I'd already read, others I've read since.  I can't recommend this book enough.	2001-01-09

In &quot;CS Lewis: Letters to Children&quot; a letter is included in which a child asks Lewis what the proper order is in which to read the books.  CS Lewis gives some explanation about how the books were not published in chronological order, but he recommends reading them in chronological order that being the order listed in the book description above.  So it seems clear that reading them either way is just as good and will not decrease the pleasure in reading these amazing books.<br />I originally read them in the order in which they were published, that is The Lion, the With, and the Wardrobe first and The Magician's Nephew 4th or so.  I enjoyed the books just as much that way.  I highly recommend that everyone read these books in either order.<br />Also, if you can obtain a copy of &quot;CS Lewis: Letters to Children&quot; I highly recommend it.  It gives a greater insight into the man who wrote these books.	2000-11-07

Britain and Ireland, 2000)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A Useful Resource depending on your trip's focus	I used the 1997 edition to travel alone through England and Scotland for 3 1/2 weeks in October of '97. I found it very useful and informative. I knew ahead of time many of the things I wanted to do and see.  This guide was  quite helpful in getting me around England by public transportation.  My  focus was mainly on larger cities with a couple of side trips to the  country. Using the guide allowed me to find a nice, clean place to sleep in  each city I stayed. In one city I stayed at a great hostel not in the  guide, but it was nice to know that I had the guide to fall back on if  needed. I can understand the disappointment of the writer of the  &quot;Caveat Emptor&quot; review. This is not the best guide for off the  beaten path travel. However, as a first time solo traveller, woman, and  British Lit fan, I found it very useful, comforting, and fun.  The only  problem I had with the '97 version was the pitifully vague index. I am glad  to say that they index of the 2000 version appears to be much more  thorough. I would certainly purchase this guide again.	2000-07-03

Now I wish I hadn't waited so long. I was first intrigued by the title, but the book far exceeded any of my expectations. This is the best book Connie Willis has  written. It's a perfect blend of scifi, Victorian comedy of manners, and  mystery. There are parts that are laugh out loud funny.  Since purchasing  this book, I have read it 5 times. I've also lent it to numerous friends  who all thank me profusely for introducing them to this book assuring me  that they are all going to go out and get their own copy. You could almost  describe it as a cross between a Jane Austen novel and The Hitchiker's  Guide to the Galaxy.  Two words: READ IT!	2000-07-03

I agree with the reader below that the plot was contrived.  I didn't find the characters all that sympathetic, but then I don't much like  stories that romanticize adultery.  However, I disagree in that I didn't  think this book was all that well-written.  The prose was too flowery and  included some ridiculously cliched metaphors.  Go ahead and read it if you  really want to, but I'd suggest the paperback (it won't cost much) or  better yet, just check it out of your local library.	2000-06-29

The essay is &quot;My Wood.&quot;  I highly encourage everyone to read this essay.  Forster reflects on materialism vs ownership in and intriguing and amusing way.   The essay is also chock-full of wonderful literary allusions.  I took an  advanced writing course at university and one of the assignments was to  track down the sources of these allusions.  It was both fun and  educational.  Cool stuff.	2000-06-02

I read this book so many times as a child and as an adult.  I probably borrowed it from the library more often than anyone else in my town.  I am buying this book today now that it's back in print!<br />This is the book you're thinking of. I too read this book as a child and was fascinated by it. There were a number of areas the kids could jump out to through the windows in the Gazebo. I particularly remember one where the children end up inside another person looking out through his eyes. And the last window was \\"Grow Up Now.\\" I've been looking for a copy of this book for years. Recently I wrote a letter to HarperCollins asking them to consider reprinting it. It's odd that they'd reprint Diamond in the Window but not this one.	2000-03-01

It's funny, this book is a sequel to the Diamond in the Window, but I'd never even heard of the Diamond in the Window until  I started looking for a copy of The Swing in the Summerhouse on Amazon.

This book may seem cliched, but that's only because it created the universe of cyberpunk, parts of which have become cliche for so many second rate hack writers.   When this book was first published in the mid-1980s, it way ahead of its  time.  Gibson is credited with having coined the term  &quot;CYBERSPACE,&quot; and with having envisioned both The Internet and  Virtual Reality before either existed.<br />I preferred Idoru to this novel,  but as a student of literature and someone interested in the development of  this genre, I recognize the importance of Neuromancer.	1999-08-12
