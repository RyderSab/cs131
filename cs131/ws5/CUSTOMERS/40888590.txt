OK, you may think I'm biased, having worked with Marcus centuries ago, before I moved to the US, when I general managed a retail book chain in London and he was senior asistant in the largest store - was I surprised to see his photo iside the back jacket of the hardcover of the Last Gang In Town! - but I don't agree with some of the reviews of this book.  <br /> <br />Sure if you want the \\"I was there with the band...\\" fairly superficial stuff go with Johnny Green's book on the Clash, but if you want a well researched, no punches pulled book, go for this one - on the Clash or just about any band for that matter. <br /> <br />Having seen the Clash sometime in 1976 (?) when they were a 5 piece (with Keith Levine, later with John Lydon's PIL), I thought they were the worst band I'd ever seen, but later liked them more & more, even when, after singing about being bored with the USA, they ended up, in my opinion, wanting it to embrace them, and became more like the Stones than anyone else.  <br /> <br />Maybe that's why Americans like(d) them so much - more than the band I found myself listening to after my friend at the time got me to a few Jam shows (now that was a band that, despite drifting more to a soul sound later in their career, never sounded anything but English!) <br /> <br />As far as a review of this book goes - I'm not doing a great job, I guess, but hopefully establishing my credentials as well as reminiscing a little. Back on track - this is, as others have said, a great book on a great band that seems as popular now among many as it ever was. If you want to read an in depth book on a band when music meant something & for a while at least wasn't (just?) a commodity, get this. <br /> <br />I've been around for a long while (in my late teens in the late 60's - yeah - I'm ancient) & I've seen a lot of bands, listened to all sorts of music & read a lot of books on music. I can't recommend this book enough! <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-08-22

If the great cover of this book doesn't grab you, then the story will! <br /> <br />Roy Thomas, one of Marvel's best writers ever & arguably most famed for his superlative Conan series, produces the best story in the Avengers' long run, as they battle far from Earth in the Kree-Skrull war. <br /> <br />The Kree, first seen as would be invaders of Earth in Marvel's Captain Marvel (not Shazam's good Captain - lately - from DC)book are facing off against their bitter enemies the Skrull, from all the way back in # 2 of the Fantastic Four. I bought the latter when it first came out (yeah, OK, I'm really old!) and also bought the original run of Captain Marvel. Even at that age I recall being interested in the FF book, being intrigued to buy a book featuring such odd looking heros after getting into comics through DC's clean cut stars. Even at that age I recall wondering what had happened to the 4th Skrull after seeing the other 3 of their expeditionary force in the last panel of the FF's book. (I don't want to go on as I might give away some of the Avenger's story here). <br /> <br />Well, Roy uses this small slip on Stan Lee's/Jack Kirby's part as a way to springboard this story into sending the Avenger's across the galaxy to intervene in a war that threaten's our planet too, as well as clear their name as it is besmirched by a politician bent on office through dragging their reputation through the mud. <br /> <br />I can't recommend this book enough. Others may feel the more recent Avengers Forever mini series is the best Avengers story arc ever. My money's on this one!!! Buy it, you won't be disapointed!	2004-08-21

A great graphic novel from the Harlan Ellison of the comic book world! Set in the future, it has a Sci-Fi (think Blade Runner) setting and a dashing if semi-roguish hero. <br /> <br />As Michael Moorcock states & best sums up on the back of the book - \\"In the tradition of the urban adventure story whose greatest exponents include Chandler, Hammett & Philip K.

Yes, it is an invaluable book on the &quot;Principles of Race Driving.&quot; It will help all drivers (not just racing drivers) become better drivers. It does this using a clear and fascinating text with copious diagrams. It is, however, also a look at the mind of one of the greatest racing drivers of all time, witnessed through his thoughts as he writes.<br />Not just for drivers, but for racing fans everywhere and not just Formula 1 but all types of fans. <br />A classic book that does not come along every day from a classic driver that also does not come along every day.<br />I've read mine many times and would recommend it to all race fans.	2003-03-24

I had my sister send me this from England every year as a Holiday gift (I'm English living in the USA). It has excellent coverage of the forthcoming season. It also looks back in a comprehensive manner on the previous one (O.K., not as good as Autocourse, but that is that book's sole purpose, it being recognised as the authoritive review of the previous year's championship race. Moreover Autocourse costs a good deal more.)<br />The portraits of each driver are well done, as is the detailed track diagrams for all the venues, allowing you to follow the racing more easily while watching it on TV. It even has results tables for you to fill in as the season develops (never used these myself - think they would be good for someone younger than this book's target audience).<br />Lastly, the color (or colour, as we say back home!) photographs. These are worth the price of the book alone. I recommend this book &amp; have used this at the beginning of and during the season, Autocourse to celebrate the end.	2003-03-24

With lots of color (black and white) photos, this book looks at the most powerful (& at 15 million German Marks - a lot of money in the late 60s - most expensive at the time to develop)sports car ever to take to the track.<br />It goes into its history at Le Mans - its originally purpose being to win there at virtually any cost, including looking at the long tail version that would reach around 240 mph on the long (Mulsane) straight there, and the factory sponsored John Wyer/Gulf sky blue & orange colored short tailed cars that dominated many long distance races. <br />It also looks at the 917s that might be more familiar to Americans - the turbocharged open cockpit Roger Penkse prepared Can-Am series monsters that produced outrageous horsepower and  which arguably put the final nail in the coffin of an already dying racing series. This was due to their enormous power - more than any normally aspirated engine could produce, the attention to preparation by the Penske team - more than any other team but the then underpowered McClaren works team, the driving skill of its drivers, not least Mark Donahue, and the rising costs of gas due to the October war in the Middle East causing presssure to be brought on the series' governing body.<br />No other team could equal Penske's Porsche turbo 917 and once McClaren pulled out of the series it was all over bar the shouting.<br />The book has a good, easy to read but informative text - the author, Michael Cotton, obviously did his homework - as well as a list of the car's successes at the back.<br />The book is maybe a little on the slim side - it almost got a 4 star rating from me as a result, nevertheless, a great addition to any real motor racing enthusiast's library.	2003-03-17

He tackles his subject matter in a historian's complete manner, but never loses sight of the fact it is an exciting ongoing subject he is dealing with and not some museum piece.<br />Unlike other reviewers (each to their own), I found this a great book and would certainly recommend it to Harley riders or fans of motorcycles who want to get a full picture of America's premier make and its models through the years.	2003-03-14

Although many remember Steve Ditko's art work on Spider-man, a character he illustrated from the beginning for about 2 years, it is his work on Marvel's Doctor Strange that stands out.<br />This is a rare hardcover (never out in paperback) collection from 1992 reprinting the master mage's earliest stories - from Strange Tales 110-111 & 114-141, from 1963-1966.<br />The quality of the color reproduction is excellent, which is great as some of the early Marvel Comics' wildest colors and backgrounds were used and depicted when Dr. Strange journeyed to some other dimension to fight another (evil) magician. <br />Some of the Marvel Masterworks library are relatively slim but you get your money's worth with this one - 272 pages of mystical combat with Dormammu, Baron Mordo, Loki and others.<br />Sure, other reviewers are correct in pointing out the dialog and stories may seem corny to some raised on the \\"grittier, more realistic\\" stories from the 80's, but I feel that is comparing apples to oranges - like comparing say the movies Gladiator to Ben Hur - both classics but products of their times.<br />I recommend this as among the best of Marvel Masterworks library.

Agents to be one of their choices for 2003 release.<br />I recall when I first saw the original comic book on the racks back in England being curious due to the number of pages it contained (way more than usual, albeit at a higher price than comics back then,)the vibrant colors and not least the illustrations by Wally (Mad Comic/EC Comics) Wood, among other stars of comic books at the time who's work graced the pages; Gil (Green Lantern) Kane being another.<br />The introduction to this volume really says it all - and better than I, so I won't go on too long! Suffice it to say, in addition to eye-catching art, the reader is treated to great stories and much better characterization than the DC heroes at the time (maybe not as good as some Marvel characters of the day, but without their overly-done angst and problems).<br />I might be sounding a little heretic here, but I must admit I found some of Wood's poses a little wooden even at that young age, and still do. His heroes just don't have the fluidity of movement as say Jack Kirby's Fantastic Four, Steve Ditko's Spiderman, Gil Kane's Green Lantern and Carmine Infantino's Flash. A bit like Mike Sekowsky's Justice League of America - legs and arms a little stiff. Still, the rest of his work more than make up for this small quibble.<br />The stories are great - in my view better than most of the comic books of the time - certainly up there with Stan Lee's work on the Fantastic Four and Spiderman. The villain is sort of like Nick Fury, Agent of Shield's, Hydra - a head bad guy who never confrnts the good guys -having his minions get bowled over like bowling pins each issue. Not so good as the Flash's, Batman's or Spiderman's varied crews of miscreants, but you can't have it all.<br />The quality of DC's Archive Editions is top notch - collecting and reading many of them bring back my first exposure to the comics way back in my pre-teens. I heartily recommend them, irrespective of what some feel is a high price, judging from some of the reviews on Amazon. I feel they are reasonable - the $34.97 Amazon price compares favorably against the $19.95 one pays for many/most Graphic Novels/Trade Paperback collections of more recent comic books, that have many less pages/stories.<br />There are several other Archive collections I hope DC publish, all of them a little \\"left field\\" -  Metal Men, Metamorpho, Eclipso, Kirby's Challenger's of the Unknown, to name few. However, I know which one I'll be eagerly awaiting - Volume Two of T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents, featuring Dynamo, Noman and Menthor, due out in the late Spring!s or Spiderman's varied crews of miscreants, but you can't have it all.<br />The quality of DC's Archive Editions is top notch - collecting and reading many of them bring back my first exposure to the comics way back in my pre-teens.

US	40888590	RR4DP0AN3S6M1	076031098X	582198094	BMW Motorcycles	Books	5	22	26	N	N	Best BMW bike book available, so far?	Having on my shelf just about every BMW motorcycle book available on Amazon[.com] (and I did not pay the high prices currently showing for some titles, even though I bought them via Amazon[.com] vendors!), I must say, as far as quality of photographs, this is the best!<br />Text is also very good. Some books on BMWs that are/were available are very slight - at least one of the ones I bought via Amazon is a remainder from England - a \\"packaged\\" book; part of a series on various makes of bike, with little text and photos used in several titles. <br />Having owned a BMW (R100RT) when I lived in London, England, and now a R1100RT, I can attest to their being fine machines -bikes that deserve such a worthy book on them.<br />I agree with the author's review that many other books on BMWs focus on the early history and concern earlier types and do not contain much on the later models. I think the author is arguably not stating the obvious reason here. This is maybe because they were written before the current \\"oilhead\\" twins were produced so understandably could not cover them, or if revised then the books were merely slightly updated after these newer types arrived on the scene so include only a chapter or so on them?<br />This book being recently published is (obviously)as a result more timely on its coverage.<br />As a rider of Triumphs some years ago, I'm saving up to buy the similar volume covering that historical make as well - not seen it but I'm sure it will make a fine companion to this title. <br />A great book at a reasonable price, considering the wealth of color photos, for any motorcycle fan and especially for BMW riders.	2003-02-02
