I read the back cover and wanted to see how the author worked through the conflict. It was a bit slow to start (for me,) but once I got into it, I couldn't put it down. The conflict with her sister's marriage was realistic and gut-wrenching, and I wish it had turned out with a happier ending, but hey, that's not reality. In regards to Hanna, I liked the way the author brought everything to a climax toward the ending. I felt Micah's pain as well as Hanna's. It is a wonderful story of forgiveness. Though it may seem unrealistic to some, I've known people in weirder situations. I liked the redemption piece and felt like the author handled the resolution beautifully.	2005-10-11

I didn't think I could possibly enjoy this story as much as Kissing Adrien, though I adore the author's writing. Then I got into Chateau and was so hooked that I dragged the book with my everywhere and lost sleep until I finished. I laughed, I cried, and most of all, my heart felt ready to burst. This novel pulls you into Europe, makes you feel the joy and pain of true love, then leaves you glowing. I enjoyed the contemporary piece as well as the medieval story of Alix and Awen. This novel is truly a work of art. It offers insight into the heart of a man who has everything but real love, and a woman who is lonely, but afraid to love again. The mystery and plot twists also made for an addicting read. I am thoroughly impressed and dying to read another novel by this author. I hear it's called Something Beyond the Skies and is coming out in January 2006. Whoo hoo!	2005-10-08

I took a trip to France (in the pages of this novel--not for real) and fell in love with the Frenchman Adrien. This is not only a fun and entertaining read, but contains some deep issues that Claire has to deal with about herself and her lack of passion for life. It really makes you think about your own life and ways to change things so you can enjoy it more. I totally loved this book. I know, I repeat myself, but I'm serious. I loved it! To the very last page. It changed my view of some things. You'll see what I mean. And of course, since I have French blood in my veins, I appreciated the cultural piece. Did I mention that I could hear (in my mind) the man speaking in French, though he mostly spoke in English? Be ready to be laugh-out-loud entertained when you pick up this novel. You can FEEL the love and her longing for what she thinks she'll never have. :) You need to read this book. You'll be glad you did.	2005-09-29

I read many books that I never post, but this one is a must read for romance lovers. The author did an amazing job at making the reader fall in love with the hero and empathize with his plight. The conflict was excellently done and I couldn't stop reading this story until I found out how they made it past all of the cultural barriers to find true love. Since it is based on a true story, you can feel the author's passion about the subject matter, but not in a preachy way. I laughed and I cried. I saw everything through the perspective of the characters, who were realistic, and very well developed. The symbolism throughout the story is also wonderful. I literally felt the hero's love pouring from his eyes whenever he looked at Angelica. I can't wait for the sequel. That teaser chapter one of the next book was mean, though, because it lured me in and now I have to wait until next spring to read it. Grrr...	2005-09-26

But I will say this... Be prepared for a page turner when you pick up this novel. It isn't a warm-and-fuzzy feel-good read, but it is powerful and will make your heart swell to unbelievable proportions as you rejoice and cry with the heroine. (Can you tell I write fiction, LOL!) Also, the author's ability to lure the reader into the mind of someone raised in a cult is SO on target. I've worked with abused women for nearly 18 years and I can tell you for certain that she has the internal thoughts and struggles of the victim down to a science. What can I say? I REALLY loved this story. Unlike most novels dealing with the harsh subject of childhood abuse, Pocketful of Pearls offers the reader grit, but served with a whole lot of bravery and hope. The characters are realistic and not super-human, yet strong in their own ways. This is a must read for people who want to get sucked into a novel and experience emotion by traveling the journey with the hero and heroine. Great plotting, too. I can't say enough wonderful things about this story. Again, I won't destroy it by sharing too many details, but rather than being a depressing story, Pocketful of Pearls is a healing one.	2005-09-25

The Surrogate is a very engrossing novel with intriguing characters and a strong plot. Unlike most suspense novels, this one actually kept me guessing and I loved the twists and turns along the way. This story was not predictable and sometimes it raised the hair on the back of my neck. So if you are looking for a story that will give you the willies and keep you on the edge of your seat praying for the safety of the characters, then you must read this book.	2005-09-21

I can't believe how true to life the issues are that the author's characters' deal with in her novels. No pain is sidestepped. No pat answers are offered. True healing and forgiveness are experienced. Consequences of sin are suffered. This is real life with a whole lot of hope. The resolutions made sense and weren't easy fixes. I got choked up nearly as often with this book as I did Remember. Also, I read the entire novel in two days (around working my full time job.) Wonderful read. I especially loved the contrast between liberal thinking and true faith. Highly recommended.	2005-09-09

The title is so perfect in so many ways. It's about so much more than 9-11. It's about remembering your first love, remembering your youth and the good things in life, remembering to care and to live in the moment rather than protect your heart from pain because you never know what tomorrow will bring, remembering God and the big picture, remembering that only God can heal our heart and love us the way we need to be loved. I cried so many times during this story I can't remember (LOL!), mainly because all of the relationships between the characters were so real. And there was true love, and romance, and kissing between several sets of characters, all with different issues causing them pain. This is so often absent in \\"inspirational\\" fiction, and that makes me sad. The characters' temptations were real, their sin and mistakes were real, the losses they all felt were amazingly real. I don't think the 9-11 thing was overdone at all. Maybe because I'm from NY state, it hits me closer to home. I remember watching the events unfold on television (while living in Arizona) and being in shock for a week. Remembering this event, in my opinion, is important, because like with any tragedy we tend to forget, and I don't think that's a good thing at all. Remembering makes us love more, try harder, and ultimately heal. Did I mention that I couldn't put this book down? Good thing this was a long weekend!	2005-09-05

The characters were deep, engaging, and real. The story was riveting until the end. Without spoiling the plot twists I'll just say that more than once I got a warm, glowing feeling and parts of the story brought tears to my eyes. I love a book that gives me not only an escape, but an opportunity to feel something special...Bonding with characters and wanting good things to happen to them. And yes, I even felt a bit sorry for the villain. I'm also totally impressed with how the author brought out spiritual truths in such a natural way. Nothing preachy here, just inspirational. Great read. This one is definitely worth your time. In fact, get the whole series! You'll be glad you did. I just wish there was a book 4 because I want to see Brad and Melissa happy, too. If it ends here, I don't get to see them find true love. That makes me sad. :(	2005-09-05

Stain of Guilt had a strong beginning, then sagged a wee bit, so I put it down. When I picked it up again, I read the rest within days. Unfortunately, I figured out the ending long before the story ended. I hate it when that happens because I'd rather be surprised. I also wish the ending would have turned out slightly different...where Annie stopped the tragedy in time. Overall, I would recommend Stain of Guilt to suspense lovers because the POV was well done and the author has an obvious mind for suspense writing and getting into the character's head. Bland's characterization was very well done. I felt sorry for the guy toward the end and experienced some of his desperation. I also appreciated the fact that Annie was portrayed as a divorced mother of two. I love how the author showed her realistic struggles raising her children with no father in the home. Very honest approach and well done. I am also curious to see who Annie ends up with romantically and I suppose I'll have to read the next one to find that out. I like that.:) Keeps me reading.	2005-09-02

I enjoyed Prelude, book #1, then had to get Cadence, book #2, which I think was the best of the three. Jubilee, book #3 wraps the series up nicely for the most part, but I do wish the epilogue would have had some mention of Michael and Susanna's wedding, which was my only disappointment. Since Michael and Susanna were the main hero/heroines of the series they deserved a happy ending, too, beyond enjoying the celebration in the park.	2005-08-26

I feared Rose wedging her way between Leana and Jamie in this sequel and that was exactly what she did. I was so mad I wanted to spit. I wanted to slap Jamie and tell him to be a real man and stick by his true wife. Leana suffered way too much in this story and it ripped my heart out. So, if you want to feel very strongly about something, this sequel to Thorn in My Heart will definitely stir you. In my case I debated on whether or not to even read the final book in the series. So, while this was well written and more interesting that the first book (in the beginning,) I read every page hoping that Leana wouldn't get hurt and was bummed to see that my fears came true. I couldn't stand Rose by the end of the book and hoped bad things would happen to her (hey, I'm just being honest, here.) If she were a real person I might feel differently. But this is fiction. When you are emotionally involved in a story sometimes that is easy to forget. Liz is an amazing writer and her ability to capture emotion is excellent, but unfortunately I felt too much on the negative end on this one.	2005-08-20

So, long story short, I agonized through much of the book, but was very satisfied with the ending. And yes, Jamie finally pulled his head out of the sand and realized he had to care for Leana and not abandon her. In the end, Leana's love and devotion paid off and because of the happy ending, I now feel ten times better about the series and would recommend it. Thank the good Lord that Liz didn't let us down with the conclusion of this powerful series. I finished the story a week ago and I'm still thinking about it because the characters became so real to me. This Scottish tale sticks with you. Worth the read if you can make it through Fair is the Rose without wanting to hurt someone. :)	2005-08-20

Though I understood at the outset that this story paralleled Rachel/Leah and Jacob of the Bible, it still started out too slow and detailed for me so I skipped to the part where Leana pretends to be Rose at the wedding. From that point on the story was truly addicting. I wanted to pull an all-nighter to finish it. The end left me satisfied because I wanted Jamie to love Leana and not spoiled Rose, and he did. I couldn't wait to read the next book, fearing the parallel to the Biblical account and wondering how it would be pulled off without being a thorn in my heart. :)	2005-08-20

I liked the way the author contrasted the world of a missionary kid who was raised on donations and taught to be thrifty, with the world of the rich and vain relatives she spent the summer with. I like how she showed the innocent being sucked into the mindset of her peers and how her present lack of communication with God allowed for her judgment to be poor (since she didn't pray about anything and had left her Bible back home.) If you have a young person in your life who struggles with always having to have the latest fashion and going into heavy credit card debt over ridiculously high priced clothing, this book is a must read. I highly recommend it.	2005-08-05

It has great character conflict, honesty, deep emotion, great chemistry between characters. It shows how unconditional love can restore trust. It's an all around excellent book and interesting from the first page because the characters feel like real people. The characters do the appropriate thing in seeking council from the pastor when needed. This issue of the past was referred to but not belabored to the point you want to scream, \\"Enough Already!\\" It didn't sound hokey and I was glad to read about a character with a less than stellar background. As a new Christian, she is realistically portrayed in regards to internal conflict. I especially liked the fact that she wanted what was best for the hero, even if it wasn't her. I also loved the fact that the hero saw her a truly forgiven, just like his friends had, rather than punishing her for something she had done before she was saved. A truly inspirational message. I sighed at the end because the love was so intense and real. And the kiss...that made the story worth reading. This is truly one of the page-turners that you'll want to backorder since it's a May 2005 date on the cover.	2005-08-04

Without giving away the plot, I must say that I applaude Ashley's decision in the end. I couldn't stop reading and plowed through this book in less than two days. The characterization of Ashley, Kevin, Brea and Seth were excellent. I feel like I know them, like they are real people. While hopeful and somewhat naive in the beginning, Ashley became a whole lot stronger and introspective by the end. The message in the story is...it's wise to be out of control. Give it to God and He'll do a much better job caring for you then you will ever care for yourself. Also, don't protect your heart by avoiding emotional intimacy. Take a chance on love. It's worth it as long as you take a risk with someone who can love you back to the extent you need to be loved. Otherwise, bag that plan. I was psyched that Ashley found true love and I'm excited about reading book three even though that's the end of the series. (Wahhhh!)	2005-08-03

It was exciting from the first page. While getting to know the characters I discovered that some had their own stories, which resolved in earlier books, and that intrigued me. Now I feel like I need to backtrack and read the others as well. I really enjoyed getting to know Dayne and Katy. Even though Dayne is lost, he longs for real love. He just doesn't know what it is or where to find it. I experienced his struggles with him and found them to be very true-to-life. Her portrayal of temptation and a life involving casual sex was believable as well as Katy's struggle with wanting fame, but discovering that ultimately it wasn't what she really wanted. She stayed true to her faith and I think in the long run that will be what leads Dayne to the Lord. This book inspired me immensely and I can't wait for Forgiven to come out in the Fall.

The Whitney Chronicles is LOL funny. Some of the scenarios I read out loud to my family and even got them roaring with laughter. I especially liked the one about the tail-gater on the way to Bible study and Whitney wanting to get a bumper sticker that says, \\"Do you follow Jesus this closely?\\" On the more serious side, I was also impressed with the author's ability to take something as serious as clinical depression and weave a tale around it so poignant and true, that it makes the reader stop and think. Unfortunately, there are many Christians who feel like Whitney's friend Kim, and suffer needlessly as the result. I also enjoyed how the author brought everything into perspective about Whitney's desire to find the right mate. The struggle she experiences regarding men loving her as a friend but nothing more, is so true for many women that it's touching. Whitney wants emotional passion in a relationship and who can blame her? The only disappointment in this story is that the author didn't give the reader the pleasure of experiencing even one kiss with Whitney. Poor girl. That would have been a nice touch. Without spoiling it for the reader, though, I will say I think it had a fabulous ending, even without an exciting smooch to top it off.	2005-07-25

The plot is accurate and carries you along like a swift current. The author's attention to detail illustrates what a gifted historian she is because it makes the story come alive. The characters are distinct and engaging and you want to see them find healing and happiness. The end leaves you longing for more (though I won't spoil it for you by giving it away).<br /><br />I read a lot of historical fiction and this story ranks high on my list of favorites. The author pulled me right into 1775 and I felt like I was living in a dangerous world--one that was a cross between The Patriot and The Last of the Mohicans.  Unlike many historical books, this one doesn't gloss over the troubling periods from that era, and feels authentic right down to the horrors of war. The spiritual element is a natural part of the story. It's very believable and practical without sounding preachy.<br /><br />Temptations experienced by characters are not smoothed over, and in fact, add to the tension and beauty of the story. The different cultures are expertly contrasted, and you feel Carleton's pain over having to choose, especially because he is a \\"wanted\\" man on both sides of the war. This well-written novel sucked me in, had me up late and sitting on the edge of my seat, plucked at my heartstrings, and then held me captive as I stood at the finish line, begging for more. This author has what it takes!	2005-07-03

While not perfect in several aspects, it was well written. I enjoyed the plot and characters and the development of the husband/wife relationship. The author also added a dose of morality which is often missing in Regency novels. Her love scenes were not so discriptive that they read like soft porn. I appreciated the author's use of forgiveness in the plot line. While not an inspirational novel, I found it inspiring. I would recommend this story for people who enjoy Regency novels but don't want to be loaded down with unrealistic sex scenes and bad language. Also, intimacy takes place within the bounds of marriage. How refreshing.	2005-06-28

The plot, foresight and creativity are intrically woven togther. The reader bonds to the characters and want good things to happen to them. The writing itself is also well done. However, many of the scenes contained crass slang words that did nothing to add to the scene or characterization and in fact, \\"cheapened\\" the novel, in my opinion. The story also weaves in and out of time so often it gets confusing even if you read it with few interruptions. Quite often I found myself wondering if certain scenes were even needed since they didn't tie into the story in any significant way and seemed to pad the pages. I do give the author credit for having the hero respectful enough to not seduce his wife as a young girl and at least waiting until she was 18 to \\"know\\" her intimately. If you don't mind cheesy sex scenes on occasion and crude language, you may enjoy this book. I personally think it would have been better if the author had referred to the hero making love to his wife and left it at that. Their emotional bond was significant and the pain they went through trying to have a child together was very well done, as was Henry's attempt to make sense of his mother's death. If not for the crass sex and adultery, etc. I would have given this novel four stars. It's unfortunate that a gifted writer would cheapen what is otherwise a great literary work.	2005-06-27

Especially intravenous drug addiction. Meth is one of the most destructive drugs available today. If one of my sons was addicted to that poison it would no doubt destroy me emotionally if I didn't have Christ to carry me through. Melody shows how God can use tragedy to grow the believer in their faith and how God uses the love and support of others to bring the hurting into a realm of healing.

This novel shows a couple's way of working through their issues over a period of years until they find peace with God and each other. It illustrates how there are no quick fixes. I love how the author delves into the hero and heroine's pasts and shows how their childhood influenced the way they viewed the world and themselves even after salvation and how they had to be willing to allow God to heal them individually before they could love each other as they wanted and needed as a couple. It also gave a great accounting of the consequences of sin and the ramification of that one mistake over the years of their marriage. A friend of mine is going through the exact same thing right now. She isn't a Christian, but is open to the Lord. She just lost her baby and was almost six months pregnant and she is struggling to cope. She wants to read The Breaking Point because I told her about the similarities. I hope and pray that full understanding of who God is, and His power to heal, will result from her reading this book.	2005-06-16

Through The Celebrity I did just that. Robert Elmer's story is engaging and pulls you right in. You see the world in a different way. The glamorous seems less appealing. The simple things in life have more pull. I enjoyed watching the change in Jamie D. Lane and I cried when he lost his best buddy Barkley. I was very satisfied with the ending and if you read this wonderful story, you will be pleased as well.	2005-05-31

I was in the airport traveling and purchased Whirlpool in Cinncinati's airport in the Christian section of the bookstore there. I don't usually read mysteries, so I was pleasantly surprised at the depth and intricacy of the plot. I cared about the characters from page one and I really loved the romantic element weaved throughtout the story. The ending was terrific and very satisfying! Now I'm going to have to read more books by this fabulous author. I'd recommend Whirlpool to anyone who loves a great mystery with engaging characters and an intelligent plot.	2005-05-12

Tricia's account of what happened in Austria during that era and the atrocities of the concentration camps is compelling. I visited the Holocaust Museum in DC in 2003 and reading her novel was like going back for a visit to the rooms with the chilling history of death and torture. Though not grossly graphic, she gets the truth of the sadism and inhumane thinking of that era across without sounding preachy. Also, the plot kept my interest and the characters were well developed. I found it to be very true to life. She did a great job weaving a fictional tale around a true life account of someone else's suffering. I keep thinking about the story after I've read it and that is unusual for me. From Dust and Ashes (first in the series) also sticks with me, but Night Song surpasses even that wonderfully written story. I can't wait for her third book to come out.	2005-05-04

Ironically, the bad sister who helped make the killer the demented person he turned out to be, happened to be named Michelle, and she was a blonde like me. Go figure. I liked the way the author had the serial killer surpress his urges and try hard not to give into them. Made you want to insert yourself into the story to protect people who were at risk of being harmed by the man. I think the author's writing skills are excellent. She sucks you right into the story. I found myself rooting for the heroine to figure out who her dad was despite his twisted past. The writer did an excellent job at getting into the serial killers mind to the point where you could understand him even if you despised what he had done. I love how his son found out about his father's past. Great story. It'll make you shudder and sit on the edge of your seat. The ending was satisfying. I would definitely recommend this author to people wanting an exciting read.	2005-04-18

I read the story almost straight through, looking for opportunities to sneak away and read a little more until I finished. I wish all stories were as unique and egaging. The hero was awesome and the heroine was a very well-developed character. I liked the way the author took something complex like a cult and peeled the layers of the onion off very slowly, showing how real people were active members, usually because they knew nothing else. And the dysfunction in the heroine's family was portrayed very well. Having worked for 18 years with child abuse cases, the details involved with the nephew's near-demise were unfortunately all too true. Very realistic and well done. I can't wait for Shelley's next novel to be released.	2005-04-18

It's perfect for reading in children's church services, Sunday school classes, private Christian school 'reading times,' etc. My friend, who is a guest reader at her children's school, said this is the perfect book to read to the first grade class, and I agree. It references scripture to verify the given examples of different ways to pray that are all pleasing to God. I love how it encourages prayer in every situation. The book also has delightful illustrations that will capture a child's eye. The artist did a wonderful job. I also love the way the story is laid out and how the poem at the end is catchy and sticks with you. I highly recommend this book for a variety of purposes in addition to simply owning it just because your child will want you to read it to them every day for at least a year. :) Michelle Therese	2005-04-15

Books	5	1	2	N	N	Too bad this book didn't exist when I was a little girl	Do Princesses Really Kiss Frogs is an adorable story with catchy rhymes and cute pictures. The author does a great job asking silly questions that curious little girls might ask. The pictures are detailed enough to keep any young reader busy. I also love the cover. Of course, I'm partial to blondes. And that froggie is just too cute for words...	2005-03-07

I loved Raising Dragons so much that I couldn't wait to read Candlestone... and it was even better. I didn't think that was possible. Circles of Seven is even better than Candlestone (I read an advanced release.) And I didn't think that was possible either.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy fiction, especially Christian fiction containing dragon characters. The characters are so real I can't stand it. I'm dying to read the last book in the series. I just wish it would go on and not end with the fourth book. PLEEEEEASE keep the series going after book 4. All three books reviewed by Nathan Hutchinson, age 13.	2005-02-17

Louise Gouge's literary style of writing is beautiful. She does an excellent job drawing the reader into Hannah's life until Hannah becomes your friend. You empathize with her loss, you cheer for her as she struggles as a single parent and you pray that she makes the right choices. I found myself getting up early and staying up late to finish this story. I can't wait for the next in the series so I can find out what happens between Hannah and David. I just wish publishers wouldn't make you wait so long for sequels!	2005-02-10

I read a lot of historicals, but none of them make me think about my love for freedom and my American heritage more than this novel. The war scenes feel real, but not overly done. The romance is excellent. The historical research is accurate and most of all, the intrigue and suspense hooks you to the end. The only bad thing is having to wait until next year for the sequel.	2004-10-23

She offers helpful, practical advice that young people can relate to. The content is interesting enough to keep the reader's attention. Having worked with young moms for sixteen years, I can honestly say that I have not seen a book more suited for today's young mom, Christian or otherwise. I see it as a sort of, \\"What to Expect When You're a Teen Mom\\" handbook. I'm glad someone had enough guts to put forth an honest book about their experience as a young mother to encourage other girls in the same situation. Her story is a great example to other expectant mothers who can't see any hope in their future. Now they can read Tricia's book and say, \\"Now there is one lady who made it.\\" If they read further they can see how God had a lot to do with it, so maybe the reader will seek God's will for her life too. Great job, Tricia. I liked the book so much I requested a copy and handed it to our county's Carenet Agency director to make available to interested expectant teen moms. Thanks for stepping up to the plate and providing a valuable resource.	2004-08-27

I especially like the emphasis on the liberation of people from the concentration camps. There are not very many stories out there like this one. I couldn't put the book down. Great love story, great intrigue/action, and accurate. I went to the Holocaust Museum in DC and this story takes you right into that era. Also, I like the Nazi piece to the story. War is a terrible thing and many people are stuck on a side they don't necessarily want to be on. Tricia Goyer did an excellent job writing this novel. I laughed, I cried. I felt the love of these people. It doesn't get better than this.	2004-07-22

I am now a chick lit fan (this is my first experience with the genre) so now I will have to buy and read every book about Ashley Stockingdale. I feel like I KNOW her, like she's a friend, because the author does such a good job of making her seem like a real person. The romance piece was also very enticing and I was dying to know what she planned to do. I hope this series goes on and on.	2004-07-22
