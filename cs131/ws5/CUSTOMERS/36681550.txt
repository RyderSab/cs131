I was able to preview the book through NetLibrary and decided that it seemed good enough to purchase. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with this book. The problem is that the author does not use his own voice and insights; the book is filled with numerous exercises (over 400!), and they give directives like \\"write down your greatest dream,\\" \\"try to visualize something positive happening for you,\\" and so on. The author makes a very very brief introduction to each chapter and, the chapters aren't really chapters at all. Basically, this book is a compilation of exercises that you have to do on your own. At the very end of this book the author states, \\"by the end of this year, you now know...\\" A year?? Anyone crazy enough to spend one year with this book needs some serious help. This book was purposeless, pointless, and a gigantic waste of time and money.	2005-10-03
US	36681550	R1VVS6X052GJHA	159310586X	2347039	San Francisco: Meet My Sister, Tess/The Landlord Takes a Bride/Grace in Action/An Unbreakable Hope (Heartsong Novella Collection)	Books	1	0	24	N	N	Awful	San Francisco: 4 Romances Blossom by the City by the Bay is a compilation of four short stories: Grace in Action, Landlord Takes a Bride, Meet My Sister Tess, and Unbreakable Hope. The stories were written from 1999 to 2003, and all of them are very Christian in theme and writing. The first story, Grace in Action, is about a fireman and a very poor woman and her child. The fireman befriends the woman and begins to date her, much to the sadness of his girlfriend Emily. In fact, Emily shows up in the last story, Unbreakable Hope. The first and last stories are a slight continuation of one another and have characters that overlap. The best story, in my opinion, was The Landlord takes a Bride - both the male and female characters were strongly written, and the emphasis on church, God, and Christianity was less intense. The weakest story was Meet My Sister, Tess; it is about an adult female taking care of her disabled adult brother, and not being able to function independently of a man. Because Tess is so poor and her brother is disabled, the references to God were all over the place - it was actually very tedious to read through and I was just wanting it to end. This writer is not particularly good; the stories are about 50-75 pages each but are not intense enough to grab your attention and make you want to continue reading. The setting of San Francisco played a very minor role in the book, and the cover gives the impression that the stories will pay tribute to the city. They didn't; the author mentioned very few places in the city and it wasn't exploited at all. It's a shame, because perhaps the book would have been better with more focus on the setting and less on God and Christianity. I would definitely skip this book.	2005-09-17
US	36681550	R2EIQ9U2ATP7VA	0312323859	351920537	Something Blue	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Terrific!	Something Blue is terrific! It's rare to find a follow-up book that is better than the first, but this book was truly amazing. It is a definite page-turner, and the main character, Darcy, lives a life of such drama and destruction that reading about her exploits, her personal agenda, and her conceited opinions of herself is like watching a very juicy soap opera. Like many, I disliked Darcy in the first book, and was wondering how the author was going to turn Darcy likeable. The good thing is... she didn't! At least for the first half of the book, Darcy is as bad as she ever was, and there was definitely a moment in the book (when she is talking to her former fianc Dex about her baby) that made my jaw drop in horror at Darcy all over again. But, despite how bad Darcy is, I kept reading. My recommendation is that you read Something Borrowed before this book; the characters in Something Blue all overlap from the first book and, although the author spends abut 5-6 chapters recapping the storyline form the first book, you definitely need the first story as a starting point for this one. Anyway, in this book, Darcy has managed to alienate all of her friends and family, with the exception of Ethan, her childhood friend that she really isn't close to anyway. So, when she is left high and dry by her baby's father and realizes her `stock is plummeting' as an attractive female, she takes off to Europe and asks to stay with Ethan. Both Ethan and Europe are the catalyst for change in Darcy, and little by little she begins to rebuild her life and view her own personality in a different way. The good thing is that Darcy doesn't completely change; she is still wicked at times, thoughtless, selfish, opinionated, and maintains the spunk and meanness you expect from her. But, it was entertaining to read about Darcy, and very rewarding to reach the end and find that the story had evolved into something so enjoyable and heartfelt. I would definitely recommend this book, and look forward to the next book in this series, or just by Giffin at all. She is a talented storyteller and took a very difficult character and made her the heroine.  <br />	2005-09-16

The main character, Jess, is 34, single, and envious of her sister Olivia, and Olivia's perfect marriage and children. As a birthday gift, Jess receives a subscription to an online dating site and manages to go on about 4 dates during the course of a year. Not stunning odds, and not very interesting reading either. Maybe it's just me, but I really thought this book was going to focus more on the dates and less on Jess and her sister. In the midst of the book, the story takes a drastic turn and becomes very `deep' in terms of the storyline; the storyline, which involves Olivia, just didn't gel with the rest of the book and its upbeat attitude. It was as if a large cloud came over the book midway through and it was hard to get the spirit of the book back. Jess does change throughout the course of the year, but with only 4 dates as a frame of reference, her changes are not that believable and neither is her eventual romance. I just thought this book was poorly written (which, aside from its poor storyline, is illustrated by all the swearing). Waste of your time.	2005-09-12

I finished it in a day because I just couldn't stop reading about Jane and her life. At the outset of the book, Jane is a hard-nosed attorney who wants things done her way, on her schedule, and without errors. In the courtroom, with co-workers, and even on dates her personality is very hard and militant and, instead of attracting men and getting to second dates, Jane finds herself perpetually single. Why? Well, despite being the best attorney in NYC, Jane doesn't realize that she is lacking some of the fundamental qualities that men are seeking in a partner (ie femininity). When Jane finally realizes what she lacks, she makes up for it big-time by morphing into someone else (Doris Day) and leading a completly new life. The transformation into Doris Day was laugh out loud funny - downright hysterical in many places, especially when she shows up at work and family functions as her new self. Aside from a solid storyline and a great leading character, there were a host of well-defined supporting characters in this book and they were all at turns funny, engaging, and evil! The author is also quite original with the writing; The Thing About Jane Spring is written entirely in the third person. At first, it was offputting but, after a few chapters I realized that reading the book was like watching a Doris Day film - because Jane wasn`t narrating, we could see her life for what it really was. I was drawn into the book as though it was a mini-movie, and it definitely had that `old-school' charm about it. It was also quite romantic - particularly towards the end! A highly recommended book!	2005-09-05

In fact, all of the pages are high gloss and are great for illustrating the finer details of each purse. Almost all of the purses are cigar-box style and very few are made from fabrics. In fact, this book was perfect for a non-sewer because none of the purses require sewing! The purses are perfect for someone who is crafty and imaginative but cannot sew. The purse designs are very inspiring, and are made by using a variety of paints, collages, decopauge, stickers, stamps, photos, handles and hardware. The pictures and accessory ideas really help to get your creative juices flowing. The description of how to make each purse was pretty good as well (though they could have been more specific and detailed). I found the book to be quite helpful and plan to refer to it often - mostly for inspiration and item placement ideas.	2005-09-05

Dicker argues, as many others have, that Walmart is a big, evil company that is destroying the lives of Americans and lowering the standards of the country. Most of his argument is centered upon their labor practices and lack of unionization; whether the labor information in the book is factual or not I don't know, but he presents his argument in such a way to make Walmart look like a corporate devil. Personally, I love Walmart for their low prices, and the lack of customer service that Dicker bemoans doesn't bother this shopper. He also touches upon their overseas factories and goes over what we already know - overseas factory workers are paid meager earnings. But he, and others, often forget that any amount of money for overseas workers is a blessing; should Walmart raise wages overseas just because? These are issues for the government of the country in question, not Walmart. Obviously, this book is anti-Walmart but even if you're pro-Walmart you won't suffer by reading this book. I did find some of the information questionable, particularly towards the end when he cited Oregon as an anti-Walmart state. I happen to know that 3 Walmart Supercenters opened in the Salem area - that is 3 Walmarts within a 10 - 15 mile radius of one another, and another super center is 15 miles up the road in Woodburn. So I'm not sure how he came to the conclusion that Oregon was fighting off Walmarts. Although the book doesn't have positivity, it's insightful and interesting.	2005-09-04

Basically, Samantha Sweeting is a high-powered attorney who is up for promotion to partner at her firm. But, when she makes a careless error, she finds herself an outcast at her firm, with friends, and even with her mother. But, her life begins anew when she is mistaken for a housekeeper in another town, and her once frenetic life as a lawyer is forgotten, as she learns to complete simple domestic chores for her employers. The plot is completely ridiculous - I cannot even fathom a person as smart as Samantha agreeing to scrub toilets and like it, but the story makes for a nice read and contains some really funny scenes (mostly in the kitchen, where most of Samantha's mishaps occur). Lucky for Samantha, her employers also have a beefcake gardener on staff (Nathaniel), and he serves as her romantic interest and caretaker. The story was fun, although the last 3 or 4 chapters were rather offputting, because they were so hectic and ill-conceived. It seemed as though the author didn't have a nice way to end the story and everything was jumbled together hastily. Overall, it was worth reading and I'd recommend it!	2005-09-02

I have used many of the top 10/eyewitness travel guides throughout the years, and really feel that Top 10 Chicago was one of the best. It captured the best the city has to offer, and was perfect for someone who had less than a week in the city. With the help of my Top 10 guide I made it to 8 of the 10 top sites. One of the best features of this book is its size - it's compact, chock-full of information, and easily fits into any bag/purse. The book also included a very helpful subway/street map and, because the book is so thin, I didn't feel like I was being conspicuous when I referred to the guide in public. DK continues its tradition of <br />including top-notch photography, and there was also a lot of <br />background information about each of the Top 10 sites. My <br />book was a copyright 2004 and all of the information (prices, free museum days, discounts) was still the same ; I would definitely recommend this book for your upcoming Chicago trip but, like with any guidebook, make sure it's the most recent version you can find so dates, times, etc. are still useful. Highly recommended! <br />	2005-09-01

(Katie Chandler, Book 1)	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Not That Enchanting	If you're interested in magical/fantasy stories, then this book will suit you perfectly. The gist is that Katie leaves her miserable job as a secretary to work as a verifier at MSI (Magic, Spells and Illusions), a company that creates spells and potions for an underground elf/fairy/magic clientele. Katie is `unmagical' and thereby able to see things in NYC that others cannot, such as talking gargoyles, women with wings, etc. Her `unmagical' nature is what leads MSI to recruit her for an open position. It's chick-lit in the sense that the main character is a female 20something that is a bit confused about her life but, it is missing a lot of the humor and wit generally included in chick-lit stories. Plus - and this was a major disappointment - there is very little romance in the story. Although Katie meets several men through work and her roommates, her only kiss in the novel is with a frog - not very romantic. I kept reading the book despite wanting to put it down, so something about the story must have been engaging but, overall, I would suggest trying something else to pass your time.	2005-09-01

This is a romantic suspense book, with lots of action and some interesting twists. The romance was typical for one set amongst danger and adventure - it was more adrenaline than sweet, and more fast-paced than a typical love story. I felt that the first  of the book was rather strong - Hunt and Taylor had a large role and as individuals they were written as interesting and exciting. But, by the time they started working together to thwart a larger threat (Jose Morales), the action was just ... overkill, and hard to follow, actually. The last  of the book was a bit dull, in my opinion but, overall, the book was enjoyable and I'd recommend it.	2005-08-25

The setting is 1942 and Katie's father has just been killed in the war - the changes that her father's death bring are tough on Katie, and her readjustment to a new state, a new school, and new friends is poignant. Katie's religion also plays a role in the book - as a Jewish girl in a mostly Catholic area she struggles to fit in. Her religious background actually serves as a nice introduction to cultural differences. The text is aimed at preteen girls and the layout is hip and modern - within the `notebook,` the author includes drawings, letters, photographs, and a variety of other scribbles that draw attention to Katie's feelings. The notebooks follow Katie through ages 11 and 12, and we learn about her and her family, her best girlfriends and, of course, the guys she is interested in. While the Depression and post-war setting works nicely for the story, some readers may find it old-fashioned and hard to identify with. However, between the pages of this notebook is a lively preteen girl facing issues most girls can identify with. Recommended.	2005-08-25

The subject covered here is widowhood; Gert, a 29 year old, loses her husband Marc in a car crash and has to begin dating again in NYC. There is tremendous focus on Gert and her status as a widow - in fact, this could easy be a self-help book/guidance book for widows themselves. Unless you are particularly engaged by this author or this sad subject matter I would advise skipping the book. Because, in addition to being a sad subject (and the author makes it sad), Gert has 2 'friends' who aren't very friendly at all. Her friends, Ericka and Hallie, are so opposite to Gert in terms of kindness and authenticity, that you marvel at why Gert would even hang out with them. The friendship between the 3 girls was another facet of the book that seemed out of place and unbelievable. Also, when Gert decides to date again, she meets Tom, a train conductor, on her first night out - it seems impossible to meet 'the one' so quickly, but she remains with Tom throughout the book. I'm a bit perplexed by this book - what exactly is this author intending us to get from her writing? The book is far more serious than most chick-lit out there and not many women in the 20something age range will find it easy to identify with Gert. I would steer clear of this one unless you have a reason for reading it.	2005-08-21

From a writing standpoint, I can already see the problem with this author - she does not create smart and sophisticated 20something women, and she leaves the storylines hanging - this was very evident in While in Rome and again in Little White Lies. In Little White Lies, Natalie Raglan `takes over' the persona of Cressida Langton but the `takeover' isn't well crafted - instead of really having a good time with the storyline (ie having Natalie mistaken for Cressida in public), we are cheated and left wondering what Leonora said to the Rutherford family when Natalie was discovered. This was a crucial point in the story and the author just glides over it and moves to the next chapter - perhaps her writing skills are not strong enough to actually write out what would have happened? We hear so much about Leonora, Leonora is the only person who can expose Natalie, and we don't even get to hear Leonora speak! It was ridiculous. My major point of discontent with this book (and her previous one) is just an overall lack of character and story development. The book is fun, sure, and quick to read, but it's lacking quality and is the reason this writer won't ever be among the best in this genre.	2005-08-11

On the positive side - this book was a quick read, the characters were interesting, and the writing was witty and fun. The main character, Georgie, finds herself in a love triangle when her ex-boyfriend, David, comes back into her life and threatens her relationship with her current beau, Mike. Mike is an extremely likeable character - he's employed!, fun, sexy, confident, and has an air of mystery about him that is quite intriguing, and it is Mike that actually propels the later half of the book. Unfortunately, Georgie is a very flawed character, and was insufferable at times - she has a wonderful relationship with Mike, and yet turns back to David for no reason whatsoever; I was disappointed with Georgie in many instances, because it seemed that she just wasn't smart -but, I must admit that she stayed stupid the entire book, so at least she was in character! However, the most misleading and disappointing part of When in Rome is that very little of the story actually takes place in Rome - in fact, it's only about 1 chapter (or 5-7 pages) that are spent in Rome - the title really made me believe the book would be set in Rome for more than just a few pages. I'd recommend the book, because even with its negative points it was still fun and easy.	2005-08-10

There are 26 full CDs to listen to, and the worst part, by far, is that there is no break/pause/music to let you know when you have reached the end of a CD and need to switch to another. The Cds were extraordinarily long, and I often found myself listening to the CD almost to track 3 or 4 again before I realized - `hey, I already heard this!' It would have been helpful, especially with a book/CD set this lengthy to have the reader let you know that you need to switch CDs. The storyline was very hard to follow as well - there was an extensive cast of characters and a lot of action taking place, and it was hard to capture all of it through listening. I wasn't thrilled by this book at all, and I'm glad I opted for the CD instead of the actual book - it was a waste of time, really. The `magic, Harry Potter story for adults\\" was not there - it was a character driven book and not fantasy or magical by the definition of Harry Potter. The book far exceeded the length it should have been and left me with a bad opinion for this author.	2005-08-10

Emily, a small town girl, moves to Manhattan to pursue her dreams, but struggles along the way to fit in with her new friends and co-workers. Her Christian values often conflict with the big-city lifestyle, and we watch as Emily goes through a series of changes throughout the book - at first she is shy and awkward, then makes herself over to fit in, and finally comes back to her own beliefs and finds her own voice.  I'm not Christian, or even religious, but was not put off by the thread of Christianity in this book. Almost any 20something will be able to identify with parts of Emily, and the book did not preach Christianity or anything of the sort. The book used Emily's faith as a way to show her internal struggles to fit in, and fitting in with a new crowd is something we can all identify with. Emily was a super character - she was smart, ambitious, a girl's girl, sociable yet reflective, and very caring and thoughtful. Her character stayed 'in character' the entire time, and even when Emily started developing new habits (like drinking and making out with her boyfriend), Emily was always concerned with her actions. The book did have romance, in fact there was quite a bit of it - no, there were no sex scenes, but that wouldn't have worked in this book. There was a sweetness and purity to Emily that made her eventual relationship even more romantic and fulfilling to read about. The writing itself was engaging, and smart. And, the ending was satisfying - although I did hold out hope that Emily would come to love NYC!	2005-08-08

The main characters - Charlie and Jas - are roommates for a short period of time before an `incident' separates them and creates a divide in their friendship. The former roommates meet up again about 3 years later on a flight and start anew. Jas joins a tour that Charlie is booked on and the two develop a friendship again while traveling the countryside with their tour group and guide. The book is slim on adventures and also on character development. Jas seemed very different than he was originally written, and there were quite a few gaps in the story, particularly about Charlie and her health. The one thing this author did well was in leaving enough `time' between when Jas and Charlie were roommates and when they met again; I really felt enough time/pages had passed that by the time they met again, they were two completely different characters. It was an interesting literary trick on the part of the author, but really didn't make the book any better. <br />	2005-08-06

The book pinpoints the 5 factors that lead to an eventual collapse of a society, and also illuminates 12-13 factors that are making our own future perilous.

Each poem is approximately 1 page long, and is about a different world location - San Francisco, Japan, Australia, Kenya, etc. I felt that the book captured a bit of each place through the poems, and that they were humorous and fun as well. For someone with an interest in poetry, geography, travel, or humor, this book would be a great gift idea or introduction to these topics. I generally dislike reading poetry but was drawn into this book because of the cute drawings and theme of travel.

This story is about family and the ties that do (or do not) bind them; two sisters who are living on different continents, come together when their mother is injured in a terrible accident. The sisters, both of whom are not particularly close to the their mother (or each other, it seems) are not thrilled to be back home again, but come back anyway. Catherine and Joely (the sisters) are both involved in romantic relationships of some sort, and are having a hard time being truly in love, mainly because of their rotten childhood. It sounds like a good story, and it starts out that way... BUT... it doesn't really live up to expectation. The girls' mother, Mimi, never says a word throughout the entire book, and she is supposedly the main problem both of these girls face, and the relationships that the girls have with their boyfriends is really convoluted and a lot is left unexplained. For instance, we don't even discover how Joely knows her current boyfriend for several chapters - they seemed so distant that I thought Joely was a nanny and not a girlfriend. Basically, there is no romance in this story and I suppose I was expecting some of that. I wouldn't recommend this book.	2005-08-01

The story is about Sofie Metropolis, a Greek girl who has gone against the family restaurant business and entered into private investigations. In this story, she's on the trail of a cheating wife, a missing dog, and a potential murder. I didn't like Sofie as a character - she wasn't funny, or smart, or pretty, and seemed to lust after someone for no apparent reason. Her familial background, and descriptions of foods are probably what kept me reading as long as I did. I made it 75% of the way through the book before deciding that I just didn't care about Sofie or her exploits. You can tell, without a doubt, that 2 different authors are writing this book (which they admit to), because the writing doesn't 'flow' from chapter to chapter. Very unimpressed - the book was sort of a Big Fat Greek Wedding takeoff, but not even close to as funny or charming. Read at your own risk.	2005-08-01

The author does a tremendous job of involving us in the life of Tom, his girlfriend Sara, and his mistress, George. Through his relationship with these two women, and also the wonderful supporting characters, we see Tom at his best (and his worst). Tom is a ghostwriter with a vivid imagination, and we're treated to some of his musings through some hilarious scenes - the book is witty, at times laugh out loud funny, and yet the writing still maintains class and even a `message' about human nature. In fact, some of the best portions of the book are the introductions to each chapter, which are written by \\"God.\\" I'm very pleased to have found this book and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for quality reading material with an edge.	2005-07-22

This book is the first of a triology about Last Chance Inc., a group of specialists who meet up to solve some of the country's most dangerous problems - like bombings, snipers, murders, etc. In this first book, Madison and Gabriel are the main characters; Madison is a criminal profiler and Gabriel (Gabe) is a member of the Last Chance team who doesn't relish the thought of working alongside a profiler. Madison, Gabe, and the rest of the assembled team have the task of finding out who is responsible for a series of murders that are linked to the president and his relations with China. Of course, being a romantic suspense, Madison and Gabe fall in love along the way. There were not any `exciting twists' or any comedic moments either - this was a straight forward book with a fairly good plot and some action too. I would recommend it, but only if you like action to take a front seat to romance.	2005-07-16

Sam is a bomb specialist and is added to the Last Chance team when a series of explosions begin to look suspicious. This book was remarkably similar to Endgame, and that was bothersome. Although the plot was slightly different - chasing a bomber instead of a murderer - the romance was almost identical. Payton is the enigma in this romance, and was just as hard to penetrate as Gabriel was in the first book. And, like Madison before her, Samantha is the one who is placed in danger as a result of the bombings and Payton is off to her rescue. Honestly, the characters were too similar to make the book interesting, and even Nigel (another member of the team) makes several comments about how Payton/Sam are just like Madison/Gabe. I'm planning to read the last book, Exposure, because I think Nigel is at least a bit more outgoing than the other 2 men and his story will be more human.	2005-07-16

The author uses Jane Austen's more famous works - Northanger Abbey, Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Persuasion, etc. to demonstrate good/bad relationship behavior. There are 10 tips, each presented in lengthy chapters, that show how to model your relationship behaviors based on the romantic couples in Austen's books. The book was actually quite enlightening - although the 10 dating 'tips' are pretty obvious, the way in which the author uses examples from Austen's works is what makes the book a joy to read. Aside from examples from the books, the chapters also include examples of real-life couples and situations. This is quite an inspiring book, especially because you can see how well educated the author is about her subject matter (Austen, not dating), and it was interesting to see Austen's books critically examined from a romantic standpoint, while still being very fun.	2005-07-01

I started by reading my own star sign to see if I felt the information was accurate or just nonsense. Surprisingly, the information presented about my star sign (and all the others) is insightful, meaningful, and purposeful. As the other reviewer stated, many astrology books focus on the negative (or even the positive) aspects of a sign, but do not really show you how to do anything with the information. But, MacKinnon does; this really is like having a coach on-hand. Through exercises designed to increase your awareness of your own goals, values, etc., she not only addresses the positives and negatives of each sign, but offers practical solutions for helping yourself get through trouble points. She devotes a generous 12-15 pages per sign (sometimes more) and the information is really valuable, whether you are interested in astrology or not. Most of the exercises (and there are about 5 per sign, so 60ish total) can be done by anyone, not just those born under the star sign the exercise falls under. This is definitely a book I'm going to keep on my shelf and I'd 100% recommend it.	2005-06-23

Although she has a great job (as a travel writer) she doesn't devote nearly as much time to her romantic life as she does to her work. So, she writes some emails to her network of worldwide contacts and has people in various countries set up 80 dates for her with foreign men. There should be nothing wrong with this book, right? It sounds fabulous - we are about to see a young, adventurous woman traverse the globe to find \\"THE ONE.\\" But... it wasn't that great. The problem - SPOILER ALERT - is that as soon as Jennifer meets her soul mate (on date #55), she pretty much hands the book over to him and loses interest in her remaining 25 or so dates. She gushes on and on about this guy and it becomes the focus of the book. She asked friends what to do after she met \\"the one\\" - keep dating or stop - and she opted to keep dating. So, the remaining dates are really uninteresting because you know she is just doing it to complete her `mission.'.  The initial 54 dates just don't capture you - in fact, I really wasn't `hooked' at all after the first 3 dates and read the book with little enthusiasm. Instead of being really interesting, Jennifer is quite boring as a travel mate and I really didn't end up liking the book at all. Give it a try and form your own opinion.	2005-06-22

The reviews that offer more stars are likely die-hard Nora Roberts fans. Black Rose was `just writing' - nothing spectacular and nothing terribly romantic or involving. The main character (Roz) is prickly and hard to like, and Mitch seemed terribly weak in contrast; it wasn't a good match. Nora Roberts is definitely sacrificing good stories in order to be a prolific writer. The couple in this book (Roz and Mitch) are both almost 50, and working together in order to solve the mystery surrounding the Harper Ghost. The ghost was actually more exciting than either of the two characters this time. The `romance' between Roz and Mitch was just as you'd expect from someone as bitter as Roz... it was unremarkable and not actually romantic. This book was really weak, but the first in this series - Blue Dahlia - wasn't good either. There are far better writers out there who can weave a better story and I'm definitely more interested in discovering them than continuing to read Roberts.	2005-06-22

Although Kat was a size 18 woman, I didn't feel as though the book portrayed either fat or thin women unfairly. In fact, Kat had a major attitude problem at times and the reality show did help to show a different side of her. The romance(s) turned out exactly as I'd anticipated and I have a feeling that Nick would have been Nick even if Kat was a size 4. The book was fun, and definitely worth your time.	2005-06-19

On her way to London, Claire Spenser, a discontented travel writer, meets Jack, a handsome man who soon becomes her everything. The problem? He is her best friend's ex-boyfriend. This minor problem becomes the central focus of the story and everything stems from the complications involved when dating your best friend's ex. The other complication is Claire's low self-esteem and the way she constantly compares herself to others in a negative light; the book seemed to be a lot about Claire and her personal demons. There was a major point of discontent with me in this book: the `friendship' between Claire and Maddy... it just didn't seem as deep and continuing as we were meant to believe it was. Maddy was drawn as a vengeful, sour, and altogether mean woman who made, and makes, life difficult for Claire. I just didn't buy into the friendship or the eventual reconciliation. But, I did like Jack and his mile-long romantic streak, and the way in which he treated Claire. Overall, it was a good book and kept me interested.	2005-05-27

Basically, 2 sisters - Rachel and Miri discover that their mother, and Miri (the youngest sister), are witches. As Rachel, and Miri, cope with her new `witch' status, they concoct some spells to change their lives. The spells go awry, but not without some fun first... the girls try to make their father fall back in love with their mother, give Rachel some talents and boyfriends, and create anti-acne spells. It's just a lot of fun, and the humor and wit is awesome. The writer is very funny and interjects such humor into the story that I didn't want it to end. I guess it hasn't really ended because there is a sequel upcoming. As another person said, that was disappointing... to have to wait for resolution of Rachel's love life. Recommended.	2005-05-22

As she reminiscences about her dog and how he used to be, an adult will get the sense of impending doom but children may not see the dog's death coming. The book is quite positive at the outset, describing how the dog is aging but used to enjoy games, running, jumping, etc. The death comes rather fast and yes, in a blunt way, but it's touching and makes me cry every time I start reading it. It's a wonderful book for children who have an older pet and those who have recently lost one; it tells the story of love between humans and animals, the joys they bring us, and the happiness that can be found with a new pet and new bond as well. It's realistic and you can't shield children from life. This book deals with a sad subject in an open manner and makes you feel something too. I'd highly recommend it because, in addition to poignant writing the illustrations are beautiful.	2005-05-19

Nick is an undercover FBI agent who hires Mia as his bodyguard; yes, it's implausible that a small little Italian girl could bodyguard a strapping guy, but Nick needs entry into Mia'a family and social circle. Under the guise of a nerd/author, he lives with Mia and it all develops from there. The romance was cute although towards the end I thought Mia turned a bit.. Maddening and immature. Donna's presence seemed to become more of a focus this time, so it seems likely that her story with Lou is forthcoming. Overall, recommended.	2005-05-10

He quits the priesthood to be with the woman.. And.. Everything should be romantic and beautiful, right? Wrong. Although the love story could have been great, it wasn't. Annie and Joe were both one dimensional characters with barely enough substance between them to keep the book interesting. I wasn't impressed with this book, despite liking the first book The Trouble With Mary.

I always held out hope that he would write something more `adult' with flowing sentences and a higher level of readability. Well, he certainly tried to do that with True Believer but, failed. I'm not a believer that this was a great story; the two characters are brought together haphazardly and without a foundation of friendship and respect. They spend a majority of their time tossing insults at one another and chasing `ghosts' that turn out to be absolutely nothing in the end. The premise is ridiculous, and I wouldn't recommend this book. Although it's far better than some of his previous books, in terms of writing ability, the storyline now suffers and the characters just don't inspire any warmth.	2005-05-07

Basically, 3 teens get letters in the mail informing them that someone has stolen a Vermeer painting and does not intend to return it until some facts about Vermeer are brought to light. Why someone intelligent and artwise would select 3 teens to solve the mystery is, well.. a mystery. The 3 kids set about trying to discover who stole a famous painting and along the way involve their teachers and make use of `clues' they stumble upon. This was an interesting book - it exposes teens to the art world and definitely uses mature words and language, without being boring. It was very much like a Da Vinci Code for children. But, the da Vinci Code made sense, and the `clues' in this book are so unrealistic and so far-fetched and convoluted that I lost track quite often. It got a bit crazy after a bit, particularly when the kids determined that the number 12 had significance for like 50 different reasons. I would recommend it, but, overall, didn't find the story believable.	2005-05-07

Personally, I found Jody - the main character - a real loser.. she was un-ambitious, living in a small town yet doing nothing active to change her circumstances, and seemed to enjoy pity-me parties. There were a few interesting moments, but those generally involved characters other than Jody; for instance, her roommate, Erin, has a boyfriend who likes to play Batman during sex..  those scenes were funny. Overall, the book wasn't humorous and the ending was not believable, at all. Also unbelievable was Jody's interest in buying a home; we are told she is a poor, lowly waitress, so where does she even have cash for this hilltop home she keeps yearning for? A lot of this book just didn't gel.	2005-04-26

Melanie just came back from a trip to Spain where she met Miguel, a boy her age who comes to NYC and visits her there. Melanie shows him the sights and, along the way, we meet her friends and her other `love interest', Justin. The book is written in a diary format, and some of the drawings and rhymes were cute (but got annoying too). I would marginally recommend this book; the age group seems to be lower than the actual intended audience. The book also contained a lot of English/Spainsh words and translations, but did the author really have to spell out each Spanish word (LIKE THIS)?

It has an enchanting cover and fine details throughout, such as cursive script for the chapter titles, little curves outlining the page numbers, and beautiful poetry to start each chapter; it's made up with details that make the book just .. beautiful. I felt 'rich' reading it - it's hard to describe, but the book and its setting (Cape Cod), made me feel elegant. The main character in the book is Willafred (Willa). Willa is 12 years old, and is struggling to find her identity; her mother constantly uproots them from city to city and Willa wants stability. Although her mother, Stella, is a wedding planner, Stella doesn't have love in her life, and Willa's fondest wish is to see Stella happy and married. Willa does a bit of matchmaking between her mother and Sam Gracemore, her English teacher. Stella is a very unlikable character; I wasn't interested in her happiness at all, and thought she could have been portrayed with more fullness. The picture we get of Stella is very removed, and even though Willa is the narrator, she does a poor job describing her first-hand relationship with Stella. The writing is very mature; what I mean by that is that the book really didn't seem suited to your average 12 year old girl. Despite the fact that Willa is 12, the readers who will find this book of interest will be much older teen girls. And white girls at that. The book has a limited audience, and the feeling you get is that it was written for rich white girls; they will definitely be more apt to identify with it than any other group. I hope it gets read though, because its beautifully written and just makes you feel pretty.	2005-04-08

The main character, Helen, is a smart forty-something working as a telemarketer in order to avoid her ex husband. I really didn't think the whole story about Helen and her ex was believable, but I suppose it's the only way the author could place this otherwise smart woman in such deplorable working conditions. Helen just isn't exciting; she isn't a particularly good sleuth, and the story and characters weren't involving. I'd recommend this book with caution.	2005-04-07

I have enjoyed them all so far, but this was definitely the weakest mystery of the bunch. There are 3 mysteries going on simultaneously, but the `thread' between them all is easy to identify. The reason this book was lacking, in my opinion, is because 2 of the people Mark was helping this time were actually alive; the books work better with a murder where Mark is actively solving something.

While the plot is funny at times, and in particular the dog/demon Jim, there wasn't enough substance to call this book great. The great romance here is between Drake (a dragon wyvern) and Aisling, but the romance is more heat and passion than true love. The story was more about Aisling than the romance anyway, and that's obviously because the author is turning this into a series. It's a good idea but I wish the book would have just ended instead of having a continuation.. The characters weren't so engaging as to warrant another installment, or two, or whatever is planned.

Austen made it to chapter 11, and that is where \\"another lady\\" takes over. There is a definite difference in the writing; you can just tell that the remainder of the book is not true Austen. The chapters are longer, the characters are more bold and outwardly flirtatious and romantic, and the writing, while very Austen, just isn't authentic. However, the book was just as fun as Austen's many others. Who knows if this is how she meant for it to go, but it's an interesting tale nonetheless.	2005-03-07

Basically, 3 friends in the publishing industry set out to humiliate a man who has been destroying their personal lives and careers. However, their stunt goes awry when the man ends up dead and the 3 women are suspects. The mystery of `who done it' kept me reading, but the conclusion to the mystery wasn't really satisfying. I also wish the author had explored the romances a bit more; there was a lot of chemistry between a few characters in the book but it wasn't a primary storyline. I would read a Stephanie Bond book again though and hope for a little more fun.	2005-02-27

Once again, Abby Rose, now a private adoption PI is involved with murder and mayhem. The characters were fun to get to know, although the craziness of two sisters - Courtney and Roxanne - was a bit over the top at times. The mystery is involving, and just long enough to hold your attention. I particularly enjoyed the trip Abby took to Jamaica to further research the case - getting Abby to another location with locals really added to the story. If you haven't read the first in the series, I would recommend that; although the author goes over the highlights from her first book the characters are drawn from the first book mainly, and just expanded upon here. I look forward to the next book.. fun and light series.	2005-02-17

The book is, basically, about a `seed' that is planted and grows into a lovely blossoming vine along the trellis one spring. It's kind of like the story of the ugly duckling who turned into a swan.. the seed doesn't believe in its own worth, but its planter (known as The Nice Lady), believes in the seed. I wasn't impressed with the story; I suppose it's about nature and the Earth and the cycle of water, sun, etc., along with patience. But, I don't think a small child is going to really recognize all the nuances, and an adult is too old to care.	2005-02-15

Gingrich presents his ideas in an easy-to-read and like myself. His perceived threats to America in the 21st Century include: environmental, China/India, terrorism, lagging behind technologically, and more. I particularly liked his ideas regarding welfare and social service, and really enjoyed that he spoke about God and the influence of God on the Constitution and the founding of America. He may or may not be right, but I enjoyed reading about it anyway. Some of the ideas he presented didn't really have merit in my opinion, like paying students to study math/science. And, many of his ideas involved too much reliance upon technology and processing things via computer.. Computers make mistakes too, but he presents the ideas of computerized elections, etc. as if that will solve problems. Overall, an enjoyable book.	2005-02-11

I discovered a lot of new information throughout the book, and was impressed by the breadth of information covered. This was akin to taking an intensive college course on Washington. Many myths were debunked and this was in no way a `political book' - it was the biography/presentation of a man who shaped our American history. Even for the casual reader this would be very enjoyable. I `read' this book via audio CD (13 CDs total), and the reader was great - very easy to listen to and understand. It make my commute much more enjoyable for several weeks.	2005-02-11

I was hooked from beginning to end on the character of Ellie Winters, and was sad to reach the end of the book. The ending  - the entire book actually - was very satisfying. Ellie, an almost 30 year old litigation attorney, has great friends, a string of ex's, a so-so relationship with her family, and goes to a job every day that isn't fulfilling. Her life takes a turn when she meets Ted Langston, a 50 something newsman from Washington D.C. The story follows the budding May-December romance between Ellie/Ted, and the problems they encounter along the way. If felt that the character of Ellie was very mature in her decisions and actions, and yet also very girly - she makes the same mistakes all of us women seem to make when we're falling in love, and she is very easy to identify with and like. I was really pulling for Ellie the whole time and enjoyed her character very much. The cover art is hideous and hides what is a very remarkable debut book. Definitely qualifies as above-average chick-lit. I look forward to Gaskell's next book and hope it's as great as this was!	2005-02-08

However, I'd give it one star for the average reader. This book is nothing more than another entry into the self-help arena. Personally, I did not identify with any of the participants' stories - swimming underwater with sharks, diving off cliffs just for fun, riding 72 roller coasters in 72 hours, etc. are not activities that the `average' person can do. The underlying message however, is that regardless of what the activity may be, you can do it if you follow the 8-steps - face your fears, rediscover your childhood, aim for the heart, etc. The book is a bunch of drivel really, and there are actually qualified psychologists and therapists with much better books to guide your inner soul if it wishes to be thrilled a bit. This book is an instance of someone hoping to capitalize on the fleeting fame of his reality program.. perhaps he should have written a travel guide instead.	2005-02-06

The bridegroom isn't particularly liked by the friends so, when he turns up dead, the mystery is.. which girlfriend did him in? The \\"Pact\\" is a vow these 5 friends made years ago to 'do away with' any boyfriends they didn't approve of. This was a very light mystery.. very light. The characters were not involving, the narrator (Rachel) was the most interesting of the 5, and even she didn't have an interesting character. I just wasn't moved by this book at all.. but was happy it was a chick-lit book that involved more than just romance, breaks-ups, etc. There was actually very little romance in this book - it was mainly a light whodunit. The end wasn't particularly satifying either. It actually would have made for a better book if someone in the pact had done the murder. This is marginally recommended - there is nothing really wrong with the book, but nothing spectacular about it either. Very forgettable.	2005-02-04

It's a good thing I didn't read this book first, because I wasn't that drawn in by the characters or thieir story. Basically, childhood friends Katherine Bloom and Jesse Chapman discover love when he returns home. Katherine was a fun and lively character, who provided humor and heart throughout the book, but Jesse... he was a cad, a player, a loverboy, etc. I really didn't see him as a fit with Katherine, and his reformed character just wasn't believable. The book was ok, but I'd skip it in favor of the other two in this series; the books stand individually and do not need to be read in order.	2005-02-01

Actually, if you delete all of the religious references, you'd be left with a fairly decent self-help book. The seven areas of your life that could use improvement include: enlarging your vision, giving, working on self-esteem, watching what you do and think, letting go of the past, finding strength in adversity, and choosing to be happy. I started with the last chapter first, and worked my way through the book according to what seemed of interest. The book does not need to be read cover-to-cover, and you can dive in wherever is most appropriate for you. Although I'm not technically 'religious' and don't attend church, I could still appreciate the greater message in this book; the book is about self-improvement and is valuable for everyone, despite the religious overtones. The only problem I have with this book (and preachers in general) is that they are imperfect too.. how are we supposed to take advice from imperfect people? I don't understand that part, and it was made worse for me each time Joel Osteen referenced himself and pointed out that he also makes mistakes. There were 2 points of annoyance with the book: one, he tells the story of Carla, a woman who was having troubles with her co-workers. Throughout the book he mentions having positive thoughts and thinking well of yourself and others, yet Carla called her co-workers 'emotionally immature.' How is that ok? Carla is supposed to be 'above' her coworkers and elevate her thinking, but how Godly is she if she's thinking ill of them? The second thing that gave me pause was the story of a man who froze to death in a freezer; apparently he always thought negatively at work, and when he got stuck in a freezer one night his negative thoughts led to his death. However, the freezer was actually not even on and the temperature was 61 degrees inside; the whole story seemsextremely unrealistic. <br />	2005-01-23

What I didn't know was that Colder Than Ice is a continuation of Thicker Than Water and brings back Beth Slocum, her daughter Dawn, and the religious zealot, Mordecai. The story was like reading Thicker Than Water all over again, except with less interesting characters. Basically, after shooting Mordecai last time, Beth has been relocated to a small town where - (surprise!) - Mordecai finds her and her lover, Joshua Kendall. The characters were dull, the story was flat, the romance was forced, and the book was uninteresting at best. These characters, and the story itself, didn't need to be revisited.

Have never read Woods before, but found his book to be pretty entertaining. Rick Bannon joins the elite Hollywood scene as security guard for a major studio. His position involves protecting movie stars from themselves, and we follow him through the course of some months at this job and the troubles he encounters. It was a bit like LA Confidential I guess.. very old Hollywood, and the feeling you get is the same.. old style. The only part I disliked was the ending (well, the last few chapters). The last few chapters dealt with the war, and it seemed very out of place and unnecessary.	2005-01-09

First, let me say that I am an astrology hobbyist and not a professional. This book seemed more `professional' or at least attempted to be. The book itself was easy to read but, at times, hard to understand. The author assumes a lot about the readers - namely, that we understand all these astrological/natal chart terms, and secondly, that we have astrology charts handy and by our side. I think that was a HUGE mistake on the author's part - the book never mentioned that you will need to have birth charts at the ready, yet the entire book relies upon having your own birth chart ready and also that of your partner, friends, family, etc. The text is pretty useless without having the charts. I figured this book would be more for laymen, but it wasn't. I expected a fun, light read and this wasn't that type of book. I don't have much respect for this author - she infuses the text with her own personal opinions (particularly about people who dislike the study of astrology), she hypes her own credentials throughout, she constantly mentions \\"read my other books for more information,\\" and she doesn't follow through with some of her own complaints. For instance, she talks about the importance of using imagery to get a better feel for astrology and how it works (ie imagine a crab (Cancer) working alongside a bull (Taurus)), and yet the book has very limited illustrations. Very unimpressed by this book. Theattempt to link psychology/astrology here fails, and there are other books out there that do a far better job of linking the two without actually attempting to. This was a big disappointment.	2005-01-08

The characters are so reminiscent of the TV series it's like watching the show all over again. And, even if you are not familiar with the Diagnosis Murder TV show, you will appreciate the characters. The story is about a double murder that takes place in Hollywood and involves movies stars and, of course, Mark Sloan. The only thing I didn't particularly like about this book was that we know who the murderer is immediately. Instead of trying to figure out whodunit, this is a `how did she do it' mystery. There is no secret as to the murderer, and that kind of left me wishing for more. Still looking forward to many more in this series though - the mystery is lighthearted, and the characters are funny.	2004-12-30

That is the basic premise of this book. The book is well written, and is enjoyable mainly because Rome and Greece are well described. The scenery is the best part of the book, and I felt like I was on a European whirlwind tour with a bunch of 18 year olds. The problem is that the characters are not 18 - they are upper 20s women who act 18 a majority of the time. Although the author tells us that the three are best friends, they spend the entire book belittling each other and ostracizing Casey. Also, Casey, the lead character, is terribly boring - I didn't believe for an instant that she was ever exciting and carefree (as we are told she was), and the end certainly didn't fit with the picture we had of her character. This book is marginal - high marks for setting and descriptions, but low marks for character strength and consistency.	2004-12-22

The celebrity, Urania, is a B-movie actress who makes life less than perfect for Tracey. Tracey's spirits (and romantic life) are uplifted by the appearance of Mark Varney, her literary agent. The story is pretty basic actually -Tracey moves to Greece and meanwhile, back in Miami, her friend Maribel discovers that Tracey's father may have not actually committed suicide. The closeness between Maribel and Tracey was one of the best parts of the story, in fact, Maribel would have been a more interesting lead character. She is strong, vibrant, colorful, and a go-getter. By contrast, Tracey is often quiet, meek, retiring, and lets others take advantage of her. While Maribel investigates on behalf of Tracey in Miami, another mystery starts to unfold at the Greek villa. Urania and her staff are keeping secrets that Tracey must uncover in order to learn the truth about herself. The book wasn't (and isn't) memorable, but was an ok read.	2004-12-22

If you like mystery, romance, adventure/espionage, and a storyline that involves precious jewels, then you'll definitely find enjoyment with The Parisian Affair. The plot revolves around Allegra Sheridon, a jewelry designer in NYC who is called upon to bid by-proxy for a multimillionaire on an emerald ring in Paris. What Allegra doesn't know is that the ring she is bidding on has a long history behind it, and that certain people will stop at nothing to have the ring, including murder. Allegra travels to Paris to bid on the famous ring and, from there, is swept up in a variety of adventures and characters. Although the auction goes as planned, the events that follow endanger Allegra's life. Her boyfriend, Todd Hall, travels from NYC to be with her and also involves himself in the adventure. The book was a very quick, and enjoyable read. However, there were drawbacks in the story: 1) Allegra was described as creative, smart, ambitious, etc., and yet once she is in Paris it seems that she lost all of her common sense - her character shifted pretty dramatically 2) the relationship between Todd and Allegra seemed forced and while there was sexual chemistry, there was nothing that made me think they were truly in love and committed - Todd was portrayed as a cad/playboy the entire time; and 3) the ending was rather abrupt.

Finding You is the story of Daniel Foxworth and Constance (Cozie) Hawthorne, a couple that meets up in Vermont after a tragic accident. Daniel, a helicopter pilot is shouldering the blame for a recent helicopter crash and is out to prove his innocence - mainly by casting suspicion on Cozie's brother Seth. Meanwhile, Cozie - a bestselling author and newswoman - is haunted by prank phone calls. Cozie and Daniel are both at the center of an unraveling mystery, and the dynamic between Daniel and Cozie is pretty good; you get a good feel for their attraction to one another and yet you know they are both very strong individuals. The family ties, particularly between Cozie and her brother, Seth, were well written, and the entire story was, in fact, about family. The Hawthorne family, which used to be powerful in this small-town Vermont area, and the new powers, the Vanackerns. The scenery really stands out in this book as well - Neggers does a good job of painting a nice picture of Vermont in the fall/winter and providing some details about clothing and such - you can really imagine how Cozie and Daniel would look. I wish Cozie had been a bit more feminine though - her character was pretty brusque and manly at times and I had a hard time eventually believing she would be a happy homemaker.	2004-12-01

It has to be, otherwise the choppy sentences, awful grammar and pointless meanderings of the narrator are just bad writing. The story doesn't flow - mainly because it isn't written in prose, but as a series of diary entries that jump from one subject to the next, and from past to present. The narrator, Ruby Capote, isn't very interesting and neither are her friends. This `poker night' doesn't take place all that often in the book - generally, the entries are about Ruby and her feelings on her life in general. I didn't `feel' anything for Ruby because she didn't `feel' anything for herself - she isn't a very pro-active character and just accepts life as it comes. A non-risk taker as she points out. This was a pretty fast read, but I still feel it was wasted time.	2004-12-01

I have read almost every Nora Roberts book available, and this seems, so far, to be the weakest start to a trilogy. The connection between the 3 main women isn't very strong (co-workers, and not always amiable ones at that), and the `thread' that holds them together isn't very viable. The thread is the Harper Ghost that haunts the home they all live in, and the 3 women (and their 3 leading men) all set about to uncover the story behind this singing ghost. It just didn't work for me. Neither did the romance between Stella and Logan; in fact, their interactions were rather brittle and distant. I just didn't feel the energy between them, and Logan wasn't a very romantic/manly lead. Since these paperback trilogies are considered to be Roberts' true romances I was definitely hoping the characters would have been that way. However, there is still hope for the next story, Harper and Haley - they seem like a more likely love match and perhaps will make for a better story.	2004-12-01

The Day We Met is, to me, what romance is all about - two people meet, they have an instant connection, and they see the romance through to the end with a minimal amount of difficulty. The story of Maggie O'Brien, a divorced mother of two, and Conor Riley, a cop with a past, is riveting! They are passionate for one another, romantic with one another, and put their own happiness above what others think. Although they face some family opposition (particularly from Maggie`s daughter, Nicole), the story is really a true romance - Maggie and Conor get to know one another more and more and the more they learn, the deeper in love they fall. In fact, Bretton does a great job of introducing us to Nicole and Charlie (Maggie`s kids) and showing us how real life and its angst didn`t stand in the way of this couple. `The Day We Met' is a perfect romance, and is not riddled with love scenes and gratuitous sex in order to be romantic (although the chemistry is very evident!). The best part about this story was that it was perfect - in addition to very involving writing, the characters did not have to suffer enormous tragedies or be separated from one another and put through `tests' to find their way back to each other. There were no games between the couple - it was just romantic!	2004-11-27

Although there really is no `main' character, the story is mostly about Constance, and she introduces us to her close and extended family when she travels to Europe for her father's memorial. The extended family is comprised of sisters, boyfriends and girlfriends, neighbors, ex-wives, and even a political leader. The reason the family/friends have all gathered is for the memorial, and in the weeks leading to this we are afforded a glimpse into their lives. Their lives are messy and complicated, to say the least- it creates tension and conflict within the summer house they are all staying at. As it turns out, the dead father also led a rather messy and complicated life, and his misdeeds continue to come to light even after his death. There was a lot of bickering (I felt) between the characters and I was disappointed with how slow the book was - it just never involved me overly much. There was also a point in the last  of the book where a new character (Jojo) was introduced and the father's past was revealed - the action and about 6 chapters in the later half just didn't seem to gel with the rest of the story. I would marginally recommend this book - it's not a romance or even a `happy' book, but is about family drama.	2004-11-25

Additionally, the author includes Moon, Venus and Mars charts in the back, so you can quickly and easily locate what sign someone falls under. The delivery is very tongue-in-cheek and has a certain crassness to it; this isn't a book that sets out to impress more literary types. However, it does what it sets out to do - enlighten you to the love aspects of the signs. I would recommend this book with one MAJOR CAVEAT: this book is very repetitive of Born on a Rotten Day. I found that much of the information overlapped, and that this book was not a compliment for the first title.

The book is short, easy to read and understand, and speaks directly to us - women who give too much in relationships and do not get half of what we give in return. The 'letters' the authors use to illustrate their points are pretty phony, but the message is clear (he's not into you), and you will undoubtedly recognize yourself in many of the scenarios. The concept of 'he's just not that into you' isn't particularly unique, but it's empowering to read and, if only for a short time, remember your own worth. The book, co-authored by a male and female (although the male writer seems to be doing all of the talking/explaining) is cutesy as well - they have 'exercises' at the end of each chapter that are lighthearted and fun (for example, color a blank flag with a red crayon and keep a look out in the future for red flags). I particularly enjoyed the end.. the authors speak about 'what to do next.\\" Often, books will explain things to you and then leave you pondering over what to do with all the information. Not so here - the authors actually offer suggestions for the future and some advice to overcome unhealthy relationships. Another plus is that the book tackled issues that went beyond simple dating - they also talk about marriage and alcohol and how to make sense of these 'bigger' subjects. I would definitely recommend this book, not necessarily because it's well-written, but because it can particularly help someone who is just getting out a relationship (or someone who needs to). He's just not that into you is definitely something to keep in mind and I think I just might in the future thanks to this little book.	2004-11-17

I'm not sure why this book was necessary, because it didn't further the relationship, didn't end with the wedding, and was filled with family squabbles and bickering. I 'think' Bretton is setting us up for a story about Claire and her own love life, but I don't think it'd be very interesting based upon her character in this book. The story contained a lot of in-fighting between family members, lots of bad blood between relations and future relations, and turned a great character (Kelly O'Malley) into a bad one for the sake of the storyline. Actually, the story was quite dependant upon Kelly and her life to propel the action. I wouldn't recommend this book - it's a family drama with no romance. No romance, no sincere story, and a lot of drivel.	2004-11-16

The ideas that Schwartz presents would be a great supplement to an introductory course in personality or social psychology, as it presents many of the key terms from those areas. Schwartz's main theory is that we, as a society, are presented with too many choices in our daily lives, and that more choice does not lead to a better quality of life. In fact, he argues that we should be satisfied with `good enough' and not seek to maximize our experiences all the time. The book was very general in nature and was easy to read and understand; the examples he used to illustrate his points were clear and easy to identify with as well. I didn't really learn anything new from the material presented here, but it was a great refresher on the subject and some of the main ideas of psychology in general.	2004-11-08

Some of the reviewers have compared him to Dave Barry.. but I don't think he's as talented or as funny. This book wasn't purposeful so much as it was just a lighthearted look at men and how they are. Some of the chapters were funnier than others... but overall I wasn't impressed. I wasn't expercting a 'serious' book, but even so this didn't live up to expectation. The good thing about the book is that the chapters are independent of one another so you can skip around and read just the ones that interest you most. <br />	2004-11-02

Basically, a big-city cop (Nate) relocates to a small town in Alaska and becomes the chief of police for this town, aptly named Lunacy. Shortly into his reign the town succumbs to murder and mayhem and the storyline becomes more mysterious as doubt is cast upon several lead characters. The female lead, Meg, is rather harsh and I didn't really like her character all that much - she wasn't likeable in any way and I often thought 'Nate is way too good for her'. Overall, Meg was the biggest drawback in the book for me, as was the murder itself. Although the murder is described very well, especially the life/background of the man killed, we never really understand why this person was killed. Also, Roberts incorporates some journal entries of the deceased into the pages but she never explains the journal in-depth either.. some loose ends I would say... including Charlene and her romance with John.. what happened ther?? The story was involving though, although light on the romance and a little heavy on the mystery and scenic descriptions. I got the impression a few times like it was a scene from that TV series Northern Exposure.. several scenes and characters mimicked that.	2004-10-18

At first, I thought the writer was a female, and I was pleased to find that a male did such a good job writing from the female perspective. The book is about failing romances. A wedding photographer - Laurie - lets us into her life and we follow her as she captures photos not only of weddings, but also of people who have broken up, divorcees, widowers, stalkers, etc. The book was about love and the many forms it can take - from syrupy  to obsessive. The story also includes chapters about Laurie's own parents and their dysfunctional love story. Those chapters were quite disturbing at times, as were some of the speeches her photography subjects gave. I think the disturbing nature of the scenes is because a lot of what was happening in this book happens to people regularly; they were feelings you could easily identify with. I did find the writing slightly `choppy' - the sentences were rather short and non descriptive.. the book was a `state it like it is' type of writing style and reflected the main character and her harshness. Laurie isn't all that likeable at first, but towards the end I was hoping she would find her own happiness too. She was well-written and very complex. This book was hard to stick with, but worth it if you keep going and can appreciate some of the layers in the story.	2004-10-14

First, it is not even a full-length book, but a collection of 3 short stories that are loosely centered around online dating/emails. The stories are about 70 pages each, and if you believe a great story can be completed in that small of a space, then you won't have a problem with this book. However, if you're looking for quality writing, characters with more than one dimension, and a storyline that is interesting and exciting, then you will hate this book.

If you watched the show it is easy to imagine each of the characters coming to life and to see the workings of Dr. Sloan as he solves yet another case. The humor from the series is here, as is the same light mystery.  I read the first three books out of order and was very impressed by the second and third books too.

The story is about an ex husband and wife (Joe and Christine) who find themselves sharing the same house for a summer - they have each brought another partner along and the 4 adults must co-exist with one another. Joe, who is on a rescue mission for an old friend, is now married but still loves Christine. The plot was rather dull and predictable, and the chemistry between the two characters was very weak. The ending was .. very weird. It didn't seem to flow with the rest of the book, and was a desperate attempt by Bretton to bring Joe and Christine back together. Bretton is a wonderful writer, but this reprinted story should have remained in the past. Not recommended.	2004-09-18

It wasn't a romantic comedy, but more dramatic in the sense that it head a well conceived plot and a story that was going in a definite direction. I think the jacket tells the story already, so I won't be giving anything away by saying the main character (Rachel) sleeps with her best friend's (Darcy) fianc (Dex). The story really isn't about the romantic relationships as much as it is about the friendship between Rachel and Darcy, and the realization that perhaps friendship is not always what it seems. There was a certain degree of sadness to this book - the main character was very sympathetic but also, at times, pathetic. She didn't have a lot of spine and I suppose her flaws made her well-drawn as a character in the book. I didn't get a `happy' feeling reading this book - despite some happy moments and a relatively good ending the writing was just too dramatic to be fun. It does keep you interested though, because the ending isn't predictable and you do keep turning the pages to find out what will happen next. By that standard it was good, and I would likely recommend it to a friend.	2004-09-07

The pace was quick, and the writing was witty and involving. As a fan of the show, I could definitely imagine each of the characters saying their lines in this book. The descriptions of settings (i.e. Hawaii and Colorado) were a bit lacking, but the characters are what drive this story and keep you reading on and on. I found the book extremely reminiscent of the television series itself, and the personalities of the characters were exact - I could completely imagine each of them voicing the dialogue from the book. The mystery itself was well-developed and was just long enough to complete the story without any unnecessary writing. Even for those who never watched the Diagnosis Murder television series, this book will be enjoyable - the writing is lighthearted, yet purposeful, and the characters are interesting and unique. I am definitely interested in reading more from this series and hope it continues for some time. I have already recommended the book to some friends who enjoy lighter problem-solving books.	2004-09-05

I was disappointed by this book, its characters, and its premise. The main character, Jane, is laid off from work, and the story could have easily been called Pity Party. Maybe because of the subject (unemployment) the writing is purposely choppy and droning?? I'm not sure, but that is the effect it seemed to have - the paragraphs are mostly discontinuous. I couldn't really care for the characters because they weren't drawn in a lighthearted matter. For instance, Todd, who is Jane's brother, is always on her case about her job hunting and resume. It made him seem as whiny and uninteresting as Jane herself. This was not a laugh out loud book, and the attempts at humor (i.e. the resumes Jane keeps sending out that are posted at each chapter end) seem like a very forced way of including humor. It just wasn't up to par with her first book, and unless you are interested in reading about an unemployed 28 year old with a bothersome brother and dysfunctional parents.. Skip it. <br />	2004-08-31

Although the plot was set up pretty good - following a serial rapist/mutilator, I didn't really `feel' this book. The characters didn't draw me in, and the case took way too long to solve. Added to that, the police psychic that is employed (Celia) didn't have a major role in the book although her character was given a lot of depth and could have been more central to the plot. The end does have a twist, but the twist came too late in my opinion and seemed like an attempt to `tack something extra' onto the plot. Is the character of Eve always so harsh? I didn't like her very much, certainly didn't feel her childhood pain as it related to the storyline, and wondered at how she could be paired with someone like Roarke. The book was ok, but I wouldn't recommend it nor read any more in the series.	2004-08-28

I was impressed by the breadth of the book, and it does, in fact, cover almost EVERYTHING about science, cells, the body, the galaxy, the stars, etc. The problem with this book is that it reads just like a textbook, and who wants to read a textbook from Bryson? I want his humor, his insights, his treks through other worlds, and not this. I was extremely disappointed by the entire concept of a science book and hope Bryson returns to his previous genre fast. This was a textbook, end of story. And, like some texts, several points were reiterated and repeated throughout.	2004-08-28

Robb elements within the same story and not separate them so distinctly. Basically, this is like 2 books bound together as one - they are really individual of one another and connect with a very thin string. It would have been much more interesting, and more complicated (obviously something Roberts is not capable of) to actually write a story that blended instead of keeping each part so distinct. The second part was boring and unnecessary - the first part was a nice romance, even though the characters did rush it quite a bit!	2004-08-23

I was pretty surprised, however, by the depth of hatred the two main characters had for one another. Although they didn't insult one another too harshly, I really felt their intense dislike for one another coming through the writing. Their attraction did start to grow towards the later part of the book, but the relationship wasn't very fulfilling. I thought Ty was very uncaring and inconsiderate of Janna. Although technically a `love story,' this book was really more of a hate/love relationship between a really nice woman and a hard-ass guy.	2004-08-07

The subject matter was a religious cult and the impact it had on the life of a woman (Julie) and her child. The cult was eradicated many years ago, but stories about it and people associated with it resurface in Julie's adult years and she is forced to revisit the pains of her past. She is a strong woman, who is drawn very well, and can be tender at times, aggressive, fun, and loving, especially towards her daughter. Her romantic pairing is with her television reporting rival, Seth, who eventually helps her sort through her past demons. The book was very lively, particularly because of the verbal sparring between the two main characters. Although the subject matter (the religious cult) was a bit weird at times to read about (particularly towards the end of the book) it was woven in really well.

By the end I had actually come to the conclusion it was a love story of sorts - how the pursuit of love, the affection for others, and social contact in general, helped Daniel to start to overcome his issues. The story is of Daniel, a man who is troubled by his social maladies and psychological ones as well. He exists in his own world that plays out mainly in his head and every human contact or outing requires significant pre-planning. Some of his neuroticisms are quite funny (ie the Rite Aid outings) and kept the book light. It was an emotional book because at times you will be laughing at Daniel, feel sadness for him, feel sorry for him, and experience happiness too. This was a fine little read with many strong points. I missed having `chapters' in the book, but something about not having them made this read more like a stream of consciousness by Daniel more than an actual book.	2004-06-05

Or, it may be that the storyline itself is just not adult enough. There was romance, but not with the lightness and fun that romance should bring. This romance was fraught with difficulties and emotions and laughter that only came at the expense of the female character. The characters were not drawn very well, in my opinion. Celeste is portrayed as a dumb, busty blonde - despite claims to the contrary, and the male lead (Rand) is a typical cowboy who holds all his feelings inside and walks about with an emotional grudge on his shoulder. The basic plot is that Celeste moves next door to Rand and spoils his attempts to expand his proprty when she announces her plans to open a petting zoo. Hello - this is the 21st century - a petting zoo is a stupid idea for the plot of a modern book! Anyway, the whole book is pretty silly - following Celeste in her attempts to get this petting zoo off the ground. The best part of the book was actually the subplot involving Sara and George, a couple that was torn apart 28 years before and are finding love again. Overall, this wasn't a good book and I won't read anything more by this author - there are far better stories out there!	2004-06-04

This book was very cute, and worthy of 5 stars because it delivers a funny, romantic, energetic, and modern love story. Although the title may be off-putting to some, this book is thoroughly modern ! The references (i.e. Buffy the Vampire Slayer and all the latest in condom-wear) keep the book from taking itself too seriously, and the result is some very funny scenes involving the two characters. Admittedly, some of the scenes did go on a bit long, but overall it didn't detract from the story. The main character, Lucern is more of an old-fashioned romantic than a vampire, and the vampire references are actually pretty minimal. The story is first and foremost about a romance, and the vampire thing is just secondary in this book. The characters are very funny at times, and very romantic too.

The book was initially very hard to get into, and I almost gave up on it, but by the middle of the second chapter I was able to get a better idea of where the story was headed. The book follows the life of Carrie Pilby, a female genius, and the problems she has fitting in and reconciling her own ideas with the people and world around her. It's a personal struggle for her to make friends, go to work, and motivate herself to do better. The irony of the story is that this girl genius is actually not very smart where it counts. She is socially inept, friendless, struggles just to make polite conversation, and lives life from inside her head. I thought the writing was very philosophical as about 80-90% of the book is musings on the state of our world (as seen through Carrie's eyes). The book is chick-lit, but not in the Bridget Jones kind of way - this is definitely more of a thinking book and is humorous only to the extent that the person at the heart of the story, Carrie, is struggling. The writing was insightful, but I'm not sure I would read anything by this author again. I was expecting a \\"light\\" read and this really wasn't.	2004-05-17

Now, we have e-mails, IM messages, answering machine tapes, interoffice memos, to-do lists, professional letters, advertisements, etc. There is no actual dialogue between characters, and the entire storyline must be gleaned through the correspondence you are presented with. There was definitely humor throughout the book, but the problem is this.. the storyline didn't flow because it was written in such a choppy manner. I didn't get a feel for the characters, and it was hard to follow because you have to refer back constantly to check for initials and code names and such; it was just bothersome after a while. In order to get &quot;the big picture&quot; for this book you have to pay attention to the little details, like the names on the letters, the way someone signs their name in an e-mail, the persons' official title. etc. This book takes the easy way out, and sacrifices content for a creative writing structure that doesn't actually work. Enough already with this format - simply reverting back to a 'normal' book structure would have made this book 100% more enjoyable. I understand it's quirky and irreverent, but 350+ pages of office memos and email is just .. too much work.	2004-05-16
US	36681550	RQRUFX4H9FGH6	042519325X	997250104	Without A Trace (Berkley Sensation)	Books	1	1	1	N	N	Not a good book	This was not a good book, despite the positive reviews it has received. As with Erickson's other books the dialogue is painful. The dialogue is filled with \\"Um.\\" \\"Huh.\\" and \\"Uh-huh.\\" and those fillers are used as complete thoughts and sentences. Obviously the characters have very little sucbstance if that can be the extent of each exchange. Is it so hard for two writers to come together and create a fluid sentence?? I guess so, because these 2 women are hopeless writers. This was the second book I was given by Erickson, and both books suffered from the Um and Huh problem. I cannot understand how writing like that is deemed interesting or engaging by other readers. In any case, the plot is about a woman who was once raped but cannot remember the face of her rapist. She is now a police sketch artist and is called in to assist on a case similar to her own, and it drudges up memories about her own rape. The authors did manage to keep the suspense going (not about the lead character Jane's rape) about the current case she was working on. However, there were a lot of shortcuts taken with this book. The relationship between Jane and Ray (the lead detective) was forced and very rushed at the end, leading to a unrealistic and unbelievable conclusion. The relationship Jane had with her family wasn't well developed and the character interaction was weak at best. The story could have been lengthened to explain the relationship more between Jane and her family, Jane and Ray, Jane and Alan, and even Ray and Kathleen. The authors cramed the story into just over 100 pages and left too much unsaid and undeveloped. The story was just that, a story, with no genuine substance or anything that will leave you wanting more from this/these authors. I am so glad to be done forever with Erickson books. NOT recommended.	2004-05-15
US	36681550	R2UTT7NMY5LN0H	1400061814	942555360	A Question of Attraction: A Novel	Books	5	5	5	N	N	AWESOME BOOK!!	I am 100% impressed by the quality of the material in this book. Basically, this is a coming-of-age story that follows Brian Jackson on his way to university. He is away from home and his childhood friends for the first time, and his life experiences are what make this book so wonderful. Through the use of humor and the right amount of emotion the author gives us a look at a year in the life of Brian and how he handles various situations. Even as a female I could identify with many of Brian's issues and found most of them laughable because they are just so human. This book reminded me a lot of Catcher in the Rye, and is definitely worthy of the comparison. The story captures you from beginning to end, and is just spot-on. I didn't realize the book and author were British, but all of the British humor and terms made it all the more fun for me to read. This is the type of book and the type of characters that will stay with you long after you finish the book. I wasn't sure how it would end, but I was so happy with the ending - I thought it was completely satisfying and the humor and compassion you feel for the character of Brian stays with you until the very last sentence. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	2004-05-15

This book is more like a travel guide to the burial sites, libraries, and birth homes of the presidents. I was interested in the book to see if there were any presidential sites near me (there are only 2), so the usefulness of this book was limited by the fact that I cannot visit 99% of the places discussed. For each of the presidents the author gives a brief snapshot of the person. There is about 1-2 pages devoted to each of the `lesser known' presidents and about 5-10 pages for the likes of Washington, Lincoln, etc. You are also given travel information - city/street maps to locate the places (which aren't very helpful), and museum hours, admissions, etc. The best part of the book were the color photos of the presidents' homes and the US map that shows the distribution of the presidential monuments. I'm not really sure I even get the purpose of this book - it doesn't offer any information that is new or interesting. I wouldn't recommend this book because all of the information it contains can be found with far better accuracy and depth on the Internet; via the museum or library websites you would get much more background information about the President you need information on with up-to-date info on hours, admissions, etc. *This review is for the 1995 edition*	2004-05-14

To enjoy these short stories you'll need to suspend reality for quite some time. They wouldn't be that bad if the writing was quality, but it really isn't. Each author only has about 40-50 pages of writing so there obviously isn't a lot going on in terms of character development, believability, and storyline. The stories were a bad trip to fantasyland and should be in the sci-fi section and not romance. Don't waste your time, especially with the latter two stories. They are completely unrealistic and written at about a 3rd grade level.	2004-05-12

The writing - as in Fuhrman's other books - was top notch. The book attempts to show us - through a series of criminal cases - how the death penalty in Oklahoma County may be overused, particularly by one Bob Macy (the county DA). At times I did feel like this was mostly an expose of Bob Macy and his crime lab assistant, Joyce Gilchrist. While I did come away with a feeling of dislike for both the work of Macy and Gilchrist I'm still not convinced that the death penalty is wrong. Fuhrman looked at isolated cases in just one county, and in a rather unpopulous state at that. The book was good, but I missed the \\"detectiveness\\" that was in all of Fuhrman's other books. I felt in this book that he was just relaying a series of events that I could read about anywhere, whereas in his other books he was an active searcher/researcher on the trail of something much more interesting and less mainstream. I also expected more interplay between him and the local townspeople, but we really aren't told how he went about his research, and there isn't much dialogue between him and anyone else. I will look forward to his next book but hope it is something more `detective-like' and not something written on topic that anyone could have done.	2004-05-11

But.. this was not a quality book. The main character (Alix) is an annoying female that is just as self-centered and obnoxious as her friends say she is. The lead male (Alex) is just not believable. In fact, the entire romance lacks realism and is hardly more than teen fluff. I felt like this book was very immature and seemed geared to a very low age group - like teens. It just wasn't well written and I wouldn't recommend it.	2004-05-10

While it was a novel approach at first, it has started to wear thin and I kind of wish writers wouldn't use it so frequently. In nay case, this book lacks character depth because of how it is formatted (emails only) and it's hard to follow the thread of the story sometimes because of it. The central plot was a romance, a triangle romance, where the heroine is caught between 2 lovers. It wasn't a really good book and I wouldn't recommend it. The characters were not very interesting and the exploits of the main character were not as adventurous as the title and preview made it seem. I think the story would have actually worked much better if it had written in a traditional format.	2004-05-09

It was quite readable, funny at times, and followed the life of Angie and her quest for love and mariage. The title and the back cover are a bit misleading - this book is not really about a woman and all her ex-boyfriends. I thought it would be, so I was surpised by that. Instead, the book is about Angie and her romantic life with her boyfriend Kirk, and how her past relationships (and his) may affect thier future. The end is very easy to figure out by the third chapter, but the getting there was half the fun I guess. This is a recommended book for light reading and lazy days.	2004-05-06

This is supposed to be a contiunation of The Notebook and follows the story of Jane and Wilson; Jane is the daughter of Noah and Allie from The Notebook. Wilson and Jane have drifted apart from one another during the course of thier 30 year marriage, and this is Wilson's story of how he gains redemption for his misdeeds all those years. The characters are flat, the dialogue is repetitive, and I felt like I was reading the same chapter from beginning to end. Every chapter is almost identical to the one before it (in terms of words and descriptions), and I found this book to be boring and badly written. There is no depth here, and the writing is as if someone is speaking to you all the time. For instance, &quot;I got up. I went out. I went to the store. I felt happy. Then I did this...&quot; It is pretty childish writing and a very flat story.	2004-05-04

It also has usefulness to adults looking to change career fields and discover what occupations are within each broader category. The book is broken down alphabetically by major, and devotes about 2-3 pages per major. All of the large majors are covered,along with some more emerging fields of study. For each major the author tell you the typical subjects you might study, the typical occupations associated with the major, and some of the qualities you need to have to find success in the field. There is also a section that tells you what the people commonly found in the field enjoy as leisure activities. For instance, people who are interested in volunteer activities and helping out at senior centers might be suited to social work. If you are drawn to law you may find leisure in debates and reading law reviews in your spare time. I thought this was the best way to use the book actually - to look at my leisure interests and match them to the right field of study (I found 3 fields). There is also a self-assessment section and a listing of organizations associated with each major. The author also lists the main reasons why someone who enter the field, and it is a good way to see if your values match the major. I found the book helpful overall and would recommend it for someone who is uncertain of what to major in or what fields to pursue.	2004-05-03

I wanted to like this story, especially because Macalister has written such funny books as \\"Improper English\\" and \\"Men in Kilts.\\" However, this more historical romance falls very flat. The characters barely know each other and we are barely given time to know them. Their motivations are not very clear as to why they like one another and eventually marry, and the female is the typical nave virgin. I found the book lacking in character development for sure, and in plot as well. It read like a teen book and not the adult novel it was supposed to be. Reading the first half was a bit like having a tooth extracted without a painkiller - excruciating. I will still look for Macalister books, but the more modern ones.	2004-04-29

The storyline is about a mother (Rose)-daughter(Maddy) relationship that is fraught with misunderstandings and distance. Despite having lived apart for many years now, Maddy moves back to her hometown and takes a job working alongside her mother. The story follows the two women through this transition and we see Rose and Maddy get to know each other once again, partly because of Hannah, Maddy's young daughter. Instead of a romance taking senter stage, the relationship between the mothers and daughters is at the forefront and th romance is slim to none, really. The book was well-written although a bit far-fetched in terms of realism. Maddy and her family are linked with another local family, the O'Malley's, through a teapot and a dying matriarch. There was a bit of supernatural involved with tat part of the story and that detracted from it somewhat, but overall it was a good read and well worth the time.	2004-04-28

The characters were rich and complex, Bretton was able to make me laugh and tear up at various points, and the story was full and highly believable. Bretton even delicately touched upon 9/11 through one of her characters and I thought it was tastefully done and very realistic.

For instance, the chapter on salary negotiation was a bit over the top. Stein tells you to go in and bargain for an incredibly high salary and then just stand up and shake hands when the interviewer comes to a number you like. It was a prety useless chapter considering most people won't be making the 80,000-120,000 salaries she kept mentioning. The other problem I had was with one of the early statements in the book - Stein says &quot;don't memorize,&quot; and yet at the end of the book we are supposed to know over 20-40 of these &quot;Q Statements.&quot; I liked the idea of Q statements and backing up your answers with solid examples, but the rest of this book was just common sense, like how to dress and research the company beforehand. I can see now why she might have had the trouble she cites publishing it. There is nothing here you can't find in another book. It's ok, not great.	2004-04-27

I hardly call that a romance, yet that is how this book is classified - as \\"contemporary romance.\\" This book is very far from being contemporary, and I'm not really sure it's all that appealing to women in the younger set (a.k.a. 20s and 30s). This book reads as though my grandmother was telling it to me - it's a grandma romance. One of the main romantic characters in the book is a curmudgenly old guy age 87. Not romantic, not sexy, not something very appealing to read about. The characters are sedate, the action is slim to none, the characters are boring, the plot is weak, and the writing is drab and just... oldish. This book has no staying power - it doesn't involve you or make you want to remember the characters afterwards. I wouldn't recommend this book or any others by Woods, especially if you're a younger woman. The book doesn't capture the spirit of romance at all.	2004-04-23

Is the story going to get better? Are the characters going to improve? Where is the story actually going? The book was ok. I got the distinct impression reading it that this book was written for Bochco's Hollywood friends and supporters more than for the public-at-large. There are a lot of &quot;in&quot; references that won't really have any impact on people not affiliated with the biz. I felt like an outsider looking in on this story and it didn't really involve me as much as I'd hoped. Despite being about a murder, the book wasn't that graphic, but was definitely very heavy on profanity. It wasn't scholarly material by any means but was a quick read with some suprisingly good humor about the human existance.	2004-04-21

Unfortunately, the book is very generic in its interpretations, and doesn't offer informative insight and analysis. The definitions are very vague and the book is for parlor games more than for true dream interpretation. I also expected a bit more illustration, but there were hardly any of those either; just a few abstract drawings. However, the biggest failure of this book and the place where it earns an \\"F\\" across the board is with the indexing and alphabetizing of the dream symbols. The index is basically nonexistent, and the symbols are not arranged alphabetically. For instance, when I attempted to look up \\"Mother,\\" it was actually found under \\"Family.\\" Also, when I tried to look up \\"travel,\\" it was listed under \\"places\\" - the listings are VERY VERY hard to find and when you do finally find them they aren't very good.

However, I really feel as though the strong points were not enough to make this a stellar read. The book is about the quest to find a key that is linked with the past, gods, demigoddesses, etc. Roberts asks a bit much of the reader to suspend reality so much and imagine people reaching through paintings, appearing in middair, living to the age of 500, etc. - the realism just wasn't there. This was definitely a supernatural story moreso than a romantic one. This is the first book in the trilogy, and the first key of three that the women have to find in order to &quot;win&quot; 1 million dollars. I think, though, that the remaining two books will be almost identical to this one, and not really high caliber writing or romance.	2004-02-20

How can you not love a family with names like Quenton Quinton? The cover art, the title and even the premise may seem a bit discouraging, but the book is a hidden gem among short stories. Although it is just slightly less than 200 pages, the story is chock-full of action, romance, and of course, hilarity. I had read something by Kasey Michaels before and was not impressed, but this story definitely caught my attention. The setting and the vocabulary are very British and the lead characters speak with such aristocracy and pompousness that it just makes you laugh. The verbal exchanges among the characters is very subtle at times, as are the barbs and wit, but it's a first class little story. Think Scarlet Pimpernel and you kind of have an overview of the characters and how they speak. The story is a light murder mystery, but at the center of it all is Miss Quinton and her evolution from a dowdy spinster to a fashionable miss. A charming story to pass a few hours with.	2004-01-16

It's not bad, but it's not great either - the book is extremely average in every respect. The characters and their motivations for doing things are not carefully crafted, the murder mystery plot wasn't that interesting, and the romance between the two main characters was weak. I kept waiting for this book to really 'take off,' but it never did. The writing remained stable, but there just wasn't enough action, suspense or romance to make this a great book. The author did her homework in terms of describing the location where the book takes place, and it appears she studied up quite a bit on mountaineering and military terms, but even those descriptions lacked feeling and that engaging quality that good writing evokes. The characters are not ones that you will remember after the book is done, and the writing just isn't strong enough to create visuals and place you alongside the characters. While reading this book, I was reminded of college professors with mundane, uninflected voices that seem to drone on and on. This book, and the writing, was very monotone.	2004-01-04

The story is basically about the romance between an American writer and a Scottish sheep farmer. The romance was very 'adult' in comparison to the countless other fluffy romances on the market, and the writing was very witty overall. I found myself laughing at loud several times, and I really enjoyed the description of the characters and the place itself (the Scottish Highlands is where it's set). I think the thoughtful descriptions of Scotland and the lifestyle of the main character (Ian) made the book really come to life for me. While there isn't a major plot here - just following the developing relationship of the characters - there was a lot of great interaction between the families. The family dynamics and adjustment of the two characters made for some very fun moments and I think the author did a great job of making her hero/heroine very realistic and easy to identify with. The only drawback was with some of the e-mail correspondence that was splattered throughout the book. Supposedly the main character, Kathie, has a best friend, Cait, that she corresponds with through e-mail. The e-mails didn't add anything to the story and in fact, detracted from it in some cases. This book will definitely have you contemplating a trip to Scotland and hoping for a Scotsman yourself! Overall, it's a definite thumbs up and highly recommended!	2004-01-03

The writing was fast-paced and entertaining, the storyline continued at a reasonable pace and there were a lot of supporting characters that were well drawn too.

The setting isn't drawn realistically at all, and there are really only a few references to how life was in the 1900s. You can easy tell that the setting wasn't well-researched and that N.R.'s attempt to drawn a mental picture of the 1900s fails miserably. The main characters are thoroughly modern, and I just get the sense that N.R. didn't put too much effort into this book. The love story is cute, but so are a million others that are on the market. There is nothing remarkable about this story and nothing that would have you wanting to re-read it or recommend it to friends. This book was written well before N.R. gained in popularity, so I would skip it in favor of a more recent book of hers.	2003-12-30
US	36681550	R2Q0APIDRC294K	0821776118	806253754	Maybe This Christmas	Books	1	1	3	N	N	Zero Stars!	This book purchase was a HUGE mistake! It is a 2-in-1 book, and the two stories are from 1973 and 1974. They are Neanderthal romances at best - the male leads are domineering, aggressive, inconsiderate, and completely unheroic. These are not romance stories by any stretch of the imagination, and the book itself is a bit like a wolf in sheep's clothing. The cover indicates that you might be in for a nice Christmas tale or two, but the cover was just a sales feature. The stories have nothing at all to do with Christmas and, in fact, do not even take place at Christmas-time. I think it was a horrible way to introduce readers to this author, especially if you have never read her stuff before (which I hadn't). Perhaps this author has improved her storytelling since the 70s, but based on this nonsense I wouldn't waste my time with her again. The stories were poorly written.	2003-12-29

A very simple love story about a heiress-turned-pauper camp counselor and an apple picker with money to spare. It isn't an outstanding book or fine fiction or literature, but it's Nora Roberts and worth a read to see how she has matured as a writer.	2003-12-28

The book actually contains three complete stories (and they are each about 150 pages each). The three stories are all about manly cowboys living in the midwest and are called &quot;Manhunting in Montana,&quot; &quot;Bachelor Father,&quot; and &quot;Pure Temptation.&quot; The first story invloves a photographer who heads out to Montana to shoot a beefcake calendar. She ends up falling for the rancher who owns the place she visits and fun and frolick ensues. Pure Tempatation is a story of childhood friends that take friendship to the next level. I enjoyed the quick wit in both of these stories and found they ended much too soon. The only sleeper in the book is Bachelor Father - it's about a baby that results from a one night stand; I thought the chemistry in the story was really fake and the story was just really droopy. All in all it's a fun read and worth the time if you can find it.	2003-12-23

I only happended to buy it because of the Golden Gate Bridge on the cover. The book was very weak in plot development, character depth, scene descriptions, etc. Cassidy and Colin - the two romantic leads - could have been developed much more if the book was longer and the writing stronger. I think the publishers are just cashing in on something Roberts penned in high school - the writing is pretty bad. Save yourself the time and money and buy a more recent Roberts book.	2003-12-23

The main storyline and the characters' interactions are a result of a suicide. The book is sold as a Cheers bar-like story, but there was no real similarity. I had anticipated hearing stories from within the diner and meeting up with a lot of locals and townspeople, but that really wasn't the case. The focus was less on the interactions at the diner and more on discovering if the suicide was accidental or not. I have read a few Sherryl Woods books and this one is remarkably similar to the others - the characters are so-so the romance is minimal at best, and the writing is better than a cheap Harlequin but not as involving as a real story should be. I was disappointed but would still recommend it to fans.	2003-11-29

The writing was quick-witted and the characters were fully developed and fun to read about. There is the main storyline, between heiress-on-the-run Lucinda, and a chauffeur, Max, and there is an equally involving sub-story between Rosemary, a nanny, and Nathaniel, a wealthy cad. The story takes place at the estate of a wealthy couple (the Coves) in Kentucky over a period of three months. The writing was repetitive at times, but only because it followed the characters' random thoughts and allowed us to see just how silly/confused they were. The plot was totally unbelievable, but the characters themselves were quite charming and made the book a worthwhile read. I thought the story started slow, but it picked up in the ssecond chapter, and was a truly a modern-day romance with freethinking, personally flawed characters. I had never read a book by this author before, but would look for more by her.	2003-11-16

The storyline involved Meredith Greene, a psychologist, and her relationship with Erik Admundssen, a professional glacier trekker/climber. The relationship is doomed from the very start, but unfortunately Meredith is lovesick and completely blind to the faults of Erik. The problem I had with the storyline was (un)believability - Meredith was supposedly a professional psychologist with some intelligence, yet she managed to get involved with a suspected murderer and then continues to cover for him when he is implicated in a second murder. Her relationship with the lead investigator, John McCord, could have been explored a lot more, but his character was introduced very late in the book and didn't have too many opportunities to really get to know Meredith. There were just way too many loose ends in this book that were never tied up and relationships that were left half explored. There was a lot of potential in the storyline but it wasn't realized. There also seemed to be a distinct change in writing from chapter to chapter (like one author wrote the one chapter and then the other took over) - Lynn Erickson is two people for those who didn't know. Anyway, it was o.k.	2003-11-03

The first story involves co-benficiaries to an estate, and the second is about two competing ranchers. I found the second story more believable and interesting than the second; it was a classic love/hate relationship with lots of character drama. Roberts' books have been republished lately with amazing speed, but these are definitely better than some of her early stories that are currently on shelves. If you're a romance fan, you'll enjoy them.	2003-10-23
US	36681550	ROZEBMPTV6EWT	0738701955	309008835	The Quest Tarot	Books	4	7	7	N	N	A Mixture of Everything	I like this deck, even though it does try too hard to be all things to all people. The cards are loaded with symbolism - I Ching, Yes/No symbols, traditional tarot figures, gemstones, the alphabet, Runes, etc. You can use the cards for simple yes/no questions, to spell out answers to questions, and to &quot;play games&quot; (as the companion book says). The images are computer generated but are still very appealing, and many of them are quite vibrant (with bright hues of pink and blue). The drawback I found was that many of the cards have the same meanings written underneath; I don't think the creator of the deck took too much time to give the deeper meanings that are usually associated with each card. The pluses with this deck are its diversity and the opportunity to try new types of readings; the companion book, which is very comprehensive and informative; and the website that accompanies the deck. I would recommend that you look at some images of the deck carefully before purchasing and only buy this deck if you like to mix symbolism, and don't mind a very nontraditional deck.	2003-09-16

I Did (and I Didn't)	This was another entry into the &quot;oh my God I'm 20/30something and not married yet&quot; genre that seems to be everywhere these days. The reason I went with 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the writing; it was quite disturbing to me that the author used parentheses in such abundance. Every single page, every single line has (words inserted like this), and it really detracted from the flow of the words. I wish I was joking, but the parenthesis are everywhere!!! The other drawback -- the writing was very choppy. The. Author. Wrote. Like. This., and all it really evidenced was that this was a young author who isn't striving for great literature. I've read a lot of the British authors and the Bridget Jones types stories, so it was refreshing to read this humorous look at marriage and dating by an American writer. The book is light, funny, and easy to read through in a few days. It was generally interesting, had some cutesy twists in the plot, provided a lot of interesting background about wedding planning, and there was enough chemistry between the characters to make it romantic.	2003-09-05

I was astounded to discover just how closely this book followed the Sabrina story/movies, and I just couldn't believe what I was reading. Obviously this author lacks for talent and original material. The most amazing thing is that she didn't even take the time to change those small details that make Sabrina such a wonderful, timeless story. I would NEVER ever recommend this author to anyone and certainly hope that people can see her for what she is, a plagarist. This is the type of thing that can ruin a writing career - did the author not see that??!!	2003-09-03

However, I was quite disappointed by the plot and the characters. The book is described as &quot;contemporary romance,&quot; but the feeling between the two characters isn't especially strong, and the romance is minimal. There was a subplot between two divorced detectives that was actually more interesting than the main characters. The &quot;mystery&quot; was ... well, easy to figure out after reading the first chapter, so the book ended up being not as suspenseful as I had hoped. From reading two of Dare's books, I would say that her strength is as a mystery writer moreso than romance. I just wish the identity of the Avenger wasn't so easy to figure out, and that the two main characters - Alex and Regan - had spent more time getting to know one another. This wasn't a poorly written book, or even an uninvolving one, it was just pretty simple and made for time-wasting.	2003-09-03

I have been reading astrology books for many years now and, while many of them touch upon the darker sides of each sign, none do it with quite the same humor as this book. This book was a Cosmo recommendation, and I found that the book doesn't mince words and really &quot;tells it like it is.&quot; Some people might not agree with how their sign is represented, but then again, aren't they just expressing typical traits of their sign? Anyhow.. I read through all of the signs and their &quot;darker &quot; traits and found that the information was the same as you would find in many other astrology books, but with descriptions that are more forceful and lengthy. The book really does focus on the darker traits and says very few positive things about each sign. The writing is focused on unearthing the 'red flags' associated with each sign, and I honestly agreed with some of the negative traits of my own sign. It's not an academic book or even close.. it's a fun read and makes a great gift.	2003-09-03

What a big mistake that would have been! This book, despite being labeled &quot;historical,&quot; was very modern in the word usage, references, and the boldness of the female character. Generally, the historical romances have those female characters who are virginal, sweet, unassuming, etc., but Sophia was a very believable American woman with a mind of her own. Her character was very well written and all of her actions seemed to flow naturally from what we were told about her. Despite being over 320 pages the book was a breeze to read through and kept me easily entertained. I thought the romance between Sophia and the Duke (James) could have been more passionate, but perhaps this writer is more plot oriented. There was a very good plot too (considering it is a light romance and not a drama), and the ending was very believable. This was definitely one of the more enjoyable books I have read this summer and would definitely not hesitate to recommend it.	2003-08-24

By the middle of the book I had given up on all of the characters and the book itself. There wasn't any romance (at all) within the first half of the book, and the chemistry was lacking between the main characters (John and Jane) throughout. Their involvement with one another was unbelievable, and the circumstances they often found themselves in were extremely contrived. This was a disappointing book. I guess if you're a fan of the author you might be pleased, but only if you can tolerate a rather blah story.	2003-08-24

As usual, this was a delightful Bill Bryson book. The book is actually a collection of newspaper columns; the columns each reflect upon some aspect of American society. Some of the topics covered include: computers, dieting, renting a car, television, the holidays, etc. There are many laugh out loud portions in this book because Bryson is able to so vividly capture the hilarity of Americans. It is a very enjoyable read, and because it doesn't have a particular order, you can skip around and read some of the columns that may hold more interest for you. I have read a lot of Bryson books, but this one inparticular reminded me a bit of the columns Dave Barry writes.	2003-08-10

Unlike a lot of romantic fluff that doesn't truly involve you, this book was rich in description and had characters that were full and believable. The storyline flowed from beginning to end, and the book followed the couple individually and as they grew as a couple. I never felt as if the relationship was contrived between the two lead characters, and the relationship they had with friends and family was just as interesting. In fact, there are several little twists that make the book very interesting before it's all over. When I read the back cover I was expecting a story that was going to involve a lot of travel and description of scenic locales, and I think that was the only let down about this book. Although the characters were flying back and forth between countries, the descriptions of the places were rather weak. Overall this is one of the best contemporary romances I've read in quite some time and I'm definitely interested in reading more from Barbara Bretton.	2003-07-10

The book is written completely through/as e-mails.. there is no actual dialogue between characters, but you never lose the plot thread. The characters were funny, the settings were funny, the situations were funny, and the e-mails were funny. I was really surprised that the author was able to make a complete and realistic storyline through just e-mail correspondence, but she did. You won't be disappointed by the characters or the writing.

This deck has been out of print for some time now (in the US anyway - in Britain there seem to be many still floating around). So, if you are lucky enough to come across this combination deck and book set in the US - grab it! The complete set does include the cards and a book with illustrations/meanings. I found the book very comprehensive and the deck itself is beautiful. It's definitely whimsical/fairy tale in nature, but the artwork is very well done. This deck is definitely for someone who isn't bothered by the intersection of astrology/tarot, since most of the cards depict the planets and star/zodiac signs. The cards are glossy, and narrower than most tarot decks, but very sturdy. The major arcana is represented as well. The best thing about the deck is how you can read from the pictures alone - there are enough graphics within the card to accurately show the meanings, and the symbolism is really outstanding. Good luck finding this deck, and enjoy it!	2003-06-15

The book was very witty, and I found myself laughing hysterically while reading some passages aloud to others. The book is written from the male perspective, and we follow the main character (Pel) around through daily activities, arguments with his g/f (Ursula), work scenes, and just life in general. There isn't a \\"plot\\" per se, but we get a glimpse into Pel's life on a regular basis. The writing/book was so fun because it was so easy to identify with the scenes and characters. I would definitely recommend this book. Oh, and don't overlook the passage on the copyright page -- it's a funny way to start the book!	2003-06-15

I am used to reading modern-day romantic suspense (like Nora Roberts and Meryl Sawyer) so this was a huge departure from those types of books. In general it is sometimes hard for me to read historical love stories because the language is too convoluted, but the writing here was very modern - no weird old-fashioned words.. just straightforward talk and sentences. The book was definitely lacking a substantial plot (there was a murder story in there, but very minimal and uninvolving). This was an extremely sensual story - the main character (Portia) was the typical unknowing virgin and her suitor (Simon) the wordly sex instructor, and they were going at it like rabbits on every other page. There was absolutely no shortage of sex in this book. The book started really well by giving some insight into their previous relationship as adversaries, but after the first time they made out it went downhill fast, and was just a book filled with sex scenes. I'm not sure if I'd recommend it or not - it wasn't awful.. just not high caliber writing/reading material.	2003-05-29

Not so in this book. This qualifies as one of the worst books of the year imo, and it was really hard to care about any of these characters or the storyline in general. The book was extremely predictable, unemotional, and simple (in terms of writing, plot, character development, etc.). It is a real waste of time, but based on Sparks' name alone this book will unfortunately be heralded by many without more discerning tastes in reading material.	2003-05-06

This is by far the most awful, horrible book I have ever read in my life... really. If you want to waste time and money to buy it and read it - go ahead, but it would be exactly that - a total waste. The writing was extremely poor and bordered on a second-grade vocabulary. There was less than zero chemistry between any of the characters - I mean, the lead male continually tells his wife/girlfriend to shutup, he calls her an idiot, and he tries to drown her in the bathtub a few weeks into the marriage - that's romantic???!!! There was no respect between any of the characters at all. I have no idea what the other reviewers were reading, but I think anything with the name Nora Roberts gets a high rating just because. This was one of her earlier works (perhaps the first? or very close to it), and I know she's improved. Just stay away from this book and I would assume anything of hers written pre-fame because it's likely to be just as awful. A terrible waste of printing money and materials. AWFUL!	2003-04-27

I found the book witty in places and fun overall - it was highly entertaining, and I didn't need to have read the first few books in the series to understand and enjoy the book (and there would be no point in going back to read them now). I almost put the book down after the first three pages because it started rather slow for me (perhaps because I hadn't read the other series), but it picked up immediately in the second chapter, so don't give up to fast! The book was kind of Bridget Jones-like to give an overall idea, but fun nonetheless. Kinsella gives a short snippet from her next book at the end of the book, and that one looks like it might be worth reading too.	2003-04-27

The writing was good though, and by that I mean the characters were fairly well-rounded and weren't just talking in cliches and mindless Harlequin-type sentences. The biggest problem, in my opinion, was that this book lacked a plot; I suppose the 'plot' is about Raine coming home to stay, but that wasn't well developed. In fact, the book didn't really get off the ground at all. The writing was ok though, and I'm still planning to try another Ross book - perhaps one that is more recent to see if she has improved.	2003-04-25

It is seemingly a &quot;self-help&quot; book, or at least that's what the title implies. While the writing is okay, the author and the stories fail horribly in providing what is most important -- the ANSWER TO THE TITLE QUESTION - What Should I Do With My Life? I still don't know what to do with my life and, although I laughed a few times and connected with some of the stories, this was a useless read. It's all well and good to present stories about people who wandered for years and couldn't find their calling, but the book doesn't give any depth or helpful advice. If you're confused already this book won't help clear anything up -- skip it and put the money towards a job counseling session instead.	2003-04-19

I have been reading NR for many years now and felt her stories were on the decline, but this book was definitely a winner. The story involves an anthropologist/archeologist, and by far their work and the insight into what they do was the best part. The storyline was fairly decent as well - following the female lead as she searched for answers about her parentage. There were actually several strong love stories in this book - the one between the lead characters, the sibling, and even the parents - there was no shortage of romance, and the writing was believable for the lead characters since they were ex's and already had a history together. The only downfall in this book was the ending - particularly the last 3 pages - it was completely fake and didn't flow with the rest of the book at all; the ending was very rushed and didn't seem realistic given the intelligence of the lead characters.	2003-04-13

This book was superior to The Cabin, in my opinion, and thank goodness she cut down on the \\"texas ranger\\" phrase. Perhaps I'm missing something, but Neggers seems obsessed with overusing phrases in her writing, and if there is one downfall in this book, that would be it.. using one phrase over and over again. Tess was a strong female character, and Sam was a good match for her, and the murder plot was interesting too, although some parts (like the kids running amuck) were hard to believe. Overall, an improvement from The Cabin.	2003-01-17

The book is a series of journalistic essays from different writers, and each one writes for about 5-7 pages on a specific topic. Some of the topics the book covers are housing/development, water, the sex industry, African Americans in Vegas, crime, growing up in Vegas, etc. Some of the essays were more serious (water) than others (sex industry), but all of them offered a nice insight into the city, especially if you've only been there a few times and have never ventured beyond the strip. I read this book a few months before moving to Henderson, NV., and thought the book was a nice way to get acquainted with the city and what goes on there. This is definitely not a book for tourists or someone planning a trip to Vegas, but more for people who live in the area, people considering moving there, or perhaps people who have visited and developed an interest in the area. It's an easy read, and an enjoyable one.	2002-12-28

I've been enjoying Neggers' books for a few months now, but this was my least favorite. The romance was barely in the book at all - the two main characters hardly even interacted and we're supposed to believe they're in love after two kisses? Yeah. Anyway, the suspense wasn't all that captivating either, and the main character (Tess) was rather cold towards her family, I thought. I think Neggers is a good writer though and would suggest starting with some of her other material first.	2002-11-19

But, it developed the main characters well enough and had a decent plot. My interest in the book was lowered by the &quot;Texas Ranger&quot; phrase being used on pratically every other line. Carla Neggers hammered that phrase into the mind again and again and again and again - it was really irksome and kept the dialogue from flowing. I wish I had counted how many times &quot;Texas Ranger&quot; was used in the book, because it must number in the thousands - it was just overkill.	2002-11-15

I have read some of the other books in this Once upon series and they have been mediocre, but these stories were all a complete bore. Save your money.	2002-11-15

I didn't think the descriptions of Greece were as vivid as some other writers (like Frances Mayes can do for Italy), but it was quality writing and had some funny moments. I especially liked that this author wrote about a negative experience, and yet managed to not make Greece seem negative because of what happened to him. I look forward to more of Stone's books.	2002-08-25

Along with the cards, there is a comprehensive book that details what each of the cards means, and delves into the history of the tarot and why it is associated with Egypt. There are many different types of spreads shown. The deck is also heavily influenced by astrology - many of the cards have the symbols associated with each zodiac sign on the card. The cards are truly beautiful, and you won't be disappointed if you enjoy Egyptian history/culture -the detail that was taken with each card is really amazing. The colors are vibrant greens, reds, blues, yellows, and purples, and each time you view the cards your eye catches some new detail. I took the time to read the book before using the cards and it made my readings much more meaningful. Enjoy!	2002-08-03

There were a limited number of characters, so most of them were well-written and developed. As others have said, it is similar to the life of Bridget Jones. I am a mid-twenties gal, and would definitely recommend this to my age group.	2002-07-04

The writing isn't outstanding (and it's peppered with obsenities), and the subject matter isn't original. However, it was funny in certain areas and it's easy enough to read.	2002-06-29

I usually like Nora Roberts, but this book was a major let-down considering Mia seemed to be the main character. I really expected her story to shine and I really expected that Sam wouldn't be easily forgiven; forgiveness came with no effort on his part at all. The chemistry between the two characters was weak and relied upon their history as children instead of their present personalities. This was by far the weakest of the three in this series and I'm definitely going to be more cautious when buying Roberts' books -- they used to be on my automatic purchase list, but now they're not. This is certainly not a book that warrants above 3 stars. Save your money and borrow a friends' copy!	2002-06-22

The meanings are printed right on the cards. As a beginner, I would have liked this deck to have included better instructions or a small booklet about how to read tarot. It is a good learning tool though; detailed pictures, sufficient wording to understand each cards' meaning, and the cards are large and yet easy to handle (although they seem to buckle pretty easily). I would definitely recommend this deck to a beginner.	2002-06-02

This was a thorough introduction to body language and the exercises that the author recommends really help put it all into perspective. I finished the book last week and now find myself studying people all of the time, and constantly using the techniques the book describes to find out more about people. The book is easy to read and focuses on the main areas of body language - eyes, face, gestures, posture, proximity, etc. The information is introductory in nature, but the author provides titles at the back that you can use to explore the subject further. A practical book that was well worth the money.	2002-05-07

I almost gave up on this book because it started slow I thought - the reason for all the running around took a bit too long to unfold. The writing was very funny in many areas, and that was great. This was my first Justine Dare book, but I will definitely look for more.	2002-05-07
