In most cases, I get it right. However, I think I got it wrong this time.<br /><br />I still do not understand who would give this book 5 stars. Did these reviewers actually use this book? Did they try to perform simple networking tasks using this book as a reference? Did they look for guidance when performing tasks that were familiar in Windows 2000 but done differently in Windows 2003? I did, and I was disappointed.<br /><br />This book is full of a rehash of the online documentation. In fact, in some cases, it is scantier than the freely available documentation. You will be forced to read through reams of boring pages just to get to the stuff the authors really have to say.<br /><br />If you want lectures about the history of Windows servers and the active directory, this is your book. But if you need a solid book that can help you answer those quirky networking questions then you'll have to look elsewhere. A book on networking administration ought to be task oriented. It should also have tons of troubleshooting tips. This one is full of fillers and useless information.<br /><br />I rarely give negative reviews, but this book is an utter disappointment. I really regret buying it.	2005-07-12

I was looking for a good book on enterprise development in preparation for my first &quot;big&quot; enterprise project, so I got this book in the hope that I would learn something worthwhile.<br />Having already been involved in the development of stand-alone applications over the years, I was comfortable with the basics.<br />My, was I disappointed! The authors obviously knew what they were doing, but how to make themselves understood by mere mortals like myself was their greatest problem. It did not<br />take me long to begin to wonder why I could easily follow Fransesco Balena's advanced writings, and I could not follow these authors'. Tried as I may I could not get past the<br />first two chapters or so, before I looked for some other things to do.<br />This is the second book by Matt Reynold's that I have bought (the other was Beginning E-commerce with VB, MTS and ASP), and I have been unhappy with both books. I don't think I<br />will be going near his books anytime in the future.<br />If you really want to learn something about enterprise development, I suggest you scour Microsoft's MSDN website, or look for a more responsible book.

However, be warned, the USMLE questions have gone more sophisticated.<br />USMLE hardly asks you this type of question now:<br /><br />A 25 year old woman taking prednisone for SLE develops fever, muscle aches, jaundice, right-sided abdominal pains. What is the diagnosis?<br />a. cholelithiasis<br />b. cholestasis<br />c. hepatitis<br />d. right lower lobe pneumonia<br />e. adverse reaction to medication<br /><br />Everyone knows this is hepatitis.<br /><br />No. It will ask:<br />A 25 year old woman taking prednisone for SLE  develops fever, muscle aches, jaundice, right-sided abdominal pains. The most likely cause of these findings is<br />a. antibodies to hepatocytes<br />b. release of cytokines from T lymphocytes<br />c. lysis of infected hepatocytes<br />d. blockage of bile canaliculi<br />e. activation of complement against hepatocytes<br /><br />Now, not everyone knows the answer (c by the way).<br />This book (First Aid) does not go into this level of granularity in covering the test materials. This does not mean that it does not have its use, however.<br />Suggestions for use:<br />1. Read this book first. Because of its concise coverage of most of the topics on the USMLE I, it is most suited for this purpose.<br />2. Get more detailed texts, and read each topic as set out in the syllabus (it is amazing how many medical students and doctors fail to use the syllabus in preparing for the exams!). The NMS series (Biochem, Physiology, Microbiology, Pharmacology are especially good). Use some other published materials for Anatomy, Pathology and Behavioral science. NMS series are not so good in those areas.<br />3. Practice with the released MCQs (150 of them). You will get some of these on the exam, trust me.<br />4. Practice with Kaplan's QBank, until you consistently score a perfect 100%. If you don't have the money for this, or if you have more time, use NMS review for the USMLE Step I by Lazo, et al. It is a great alternative/complement<br />5. Reread this book (first Aid) to round up your preparations.<br /><br />6. Go smash the USMLE step I. You will most likely score in the 95th per centile.<br /><br />Good luck.your preparations.    6. Go smash the USMLE step I. You will most likely score in the 95th per centile.

Some lines of code just appear almost from nowhere; some of those that are accounted for are mysteriously rearranged in the book.<br />The authors' coding styles are neither here nor there. They do not seem to be within easy grasp of the VB.net newby or at the league of the blackbelt category.<br />Secondly, there are several omissions and inadequate explanations in the text. The authors obviously know their jobs. But they have difficulty imparting that knowledge to their readers. 21 chapters in a book of 360 pages mean each chapter, including the code snippets and screenshots, occupy less than 18 pages. Not that I am a fan of fluff, but I believe that adequate explanations would require many more pages.<br />Thirdly, a few explanations are simply wrong. E.g. you don't save files with .visual basic extension, but with .vb; neither do you write:<br />Me.TextBox.AcceptReturn = True<br />Me.TextBox.MultiLine = True<br />.......<br />But you write:<br />With Me.TextBox<br />  .AcceptReturn = True<br />  .MultiLine = True<br />.......<br />End With<br />I gave it three stars because it gives the reader a bird's eye-view of what OOP looks like in VB.net. But that's how far this book can go. If you really want to learn OOP in better details, you will need to use additional resources--either one that is geared to the newbies, or one that is aimed at the gurus out there. This hermaphrodite of a book defies easy placement.	2002-12-18

It is so comprehensive that you probably wouldn't need any other concordances.<br />This book has a few imperfections, though, viz.:<br />1. the print is relatively small. This is a small problem, though, for many people who can read small print. Not a problem for me.<br />2. since each entry relies on Strong's numbering, you will need a copy of Strong's concordance, assuming you are like most of us without a prior knowledge of Hebrews. This, too may not be a bad idea; I have Strong's. However, it would have been better to provide a list of Strong's entries in a couple of pages.<br />But for the above, the book deserves five stars. Having said all this, I would still heartily recommend Wigram's Concordance.	2002-12-10

It starts at the beginning and effectively takes the reader through the usual twists and turns of a new programming language. It is also good in treating some advanced topics (e.g. threads, remoting, assemblies, etc).<br />However, this book pays little attention to certain important areas:<br />1. there is only 1 chapter on ASP.net. and that chapter could not even begin to scratch the subject on the surface!<br />2. web services also received a cursory treatment.<br />Thses two areas are of vital importance to me as an ecommerce developer. I expected a more detailed treatment in a book that claims to &quot;Master C#&quot;<br />3. lastly, this book is also deficient where most programming books do: it lacks a full example of an application, where all the concepts taught in the book are brought together to build one application. Of what use is it to learn the syntax of a language and not know how to use it? Those code snipets that often appear on several pages of these books are not enough. There ought to be a running application, or a seperate section of the book where a good application is developed and the reader is walked through it.<br />O yes, this is ok to ask. Some great books have done this in the past. A few of them is listed:<br />a)Professional VB6 Databases by Charles Williams, Wrox Press)<br />b)Starting Out With C++ by Tony Gaddis (Scott Jones publishers)<br />c) Visual Basic 6 Application Development (Boutkin, et al, Wrox Press).<br />I hope our authors would consider this when they sit down to write that next book.<br />Overall, this is a great book. I would have given it 4.5 stars but there is no way to do that. It does not deserve 5 stars from me because of those things I highlighted above.	2002-11-30

I was aware, of course, that I needed to understand the basic chemical processes that affected the human body, but I couldn't find any reason why my professors would treat medical students as if they were biochem majors. Boy, was I glad when the biochemistry class was over, and I passed the darn course!<br />I was to meet this same course a few years ago, when I had to sit for the USMLE I. Like a sick child who must swallow a bitter tablet, I reluctantly began to study biochem. Again.<br />It was a very pleasant surprise that the course was really interesting. I mean, I enjoyed it as much as I did physiology (and I always loved physiology!).<br />I realized that I came to love biochem because of this book. The authors knew how to give you solid biochemical reasons for those familiar clinical conditions. Contrary to my previous experiences in med school, I found out that biochemistry is indeed a very interesting vourse.<br />The only (small) problem that you may find with this book is, it could be too detailed at times. However, it covers the USMLE topics quite well. If you have read Kaplan's materials, you'd agree that there are very many similarities. I read both.<br />If you want to use it for the USMLE I exam, I suggest you first read the specific topics required for the exam. Afterwards, you may then the other areas that are not vital for the exam, if you are interested, and you have the extra time.<br />I wish I had this book much earlier. It's really nice.	2002-07-04

Sometimnes it amazes me how this author managed to know so much about VB.net in so short a time since the product was released. His style is stimulating; his coverage of the subject matter is superb, and the organization of the text is simply great.<br />If you must have one book on VB.net, make sure it is this one. For one, it will save you much money. You don't have to spend your hard-earned dollars on books that are little more than a rehash of the online documentation. Secondly (and more importantly), you will also save time, because you'll be able to delve right away into the meat of VB.net without wasting time on trivial issues.<br />Of course, this book does not cover everything there is to know about the .net platform. However, it gives you a very robust foundation in everything vb.net and the new .net platform. It is my firm belief that as long as you stay with the new platform, you will have cause to refer again and again to this book.<br />Mr. Balena happens to be one of those rare technical authors that know how to write.<br />The only little problem I had with the book was the CD-ROM that does not contain the electronic version of the book (it contains the VB 6 version). I contacted the author and he offered a convincing explanation of why that was left out. (Some buyers loaded the vb 6 version on their websites, for free download by anyone, causing huge losses to the publishers. So they decided to leave it out in the new edition).<br />Even then, I still heartily recommend this superb book.	2002-06-16

In that book, he did a mavelous job. I still refer to that book when faced with some ASP problems.<br />I thought I was going to get a similar tutorial-like coverage of ASP.net in this book. Having used it for the past few weeks however, I discovered that this book was nowhere close to what I expected.<br />Most of the author's examples were rather short. There were repetitious explanations in many sections of the book. Even the two sample applications lacked any meaningful depth. Some of the examples he gave here were lifted from the author's previous book.<br />Summary: If you are looking for a book that can serve as a reference, then this should be on your list. But if you want to really delve into what ASP.net has to offer, I think you'll have to look elsewhere. Surprising enough, the Visual studio.net documentation contains a whole lot of useful information.<br />I am sorry I have to say I was disappointed with this big book; Mr. Walther did not do as much a great job as he did in his previous book on ASP. It is better to be a little late, and do a fantastic job, than be the first to market with a less than excellent product, especially if you have an established name.	2002-05-14

Send in your application as required (through ERAS), and call later to schedule interviews.<br />5. While preparing for your interview, and depending on your choice of specialty, read through Fred Ferri's \\"Care of the medical patient\\" (for internal medicine); it's probably the best book for practical medical care; or \\"Consultation Psychiatry\\" (for Psychiatry positions); or any other concise books. The point here is, never go for any of these interviews with an \\"empty head\\".<br />6. Get information about the hospitals (yes, you need this for the interview).

I didn't know this until barely a week in advance, so I needed a book that &quot;cut to the chase&quot;. It was a pleasant surprise that this tiny book delivered. Using the samples in this &quot;cookbook&quot;, I got exactly what I wanted. If you are looking for something for beginners, this book is an excellent choice.	2001-07-07

Who really needs an introduction to this Medical Bible?<br />Harrison's is probably the best medical reference for medical professionals there is. As expected, the 14th edition of this authoritative reference lives up to its name. This book is not meant to be used as a textbook by medical students (or anyone for that matter). For those looking for a textbook, I suggest &quot;Cecil's textbook of medicine&quot;, which does a beautiful job in that area. However, when you need to know the last say on any topic in Internal Medicine, your best bet remains Harrison's.	2001-06-03
US	51778201	R1F7UZVUR9QEED	1576760456	351080934	Starting Out With the C++ (2nd Alternate Edition)	Books	5	7	7	N	N	this is still the best book on C++	I got this book because I had to take  a C++ class as part of the requirements for a Masters degree program at Johns Hopkins, and a friend told me that C++ was not an easy nut to crack. I had never programmed in C++ before, but I was determined to learn as much as I could before the class started. This book by Mr. Gaddis gently introduced me to the world of C++ and, before I got half-way through it, I was not only comfortable with the language, I understood the essential ideas behind the language.  The essential pros of this book are: 1) It is very detailed and concise at the same time. 2) The style of writing is very clear and easy to follow. 3) It covers virtually everything that any serious C++ programmer needs to know. 4) It comes with a floppy disk which contains all the codes in the book 5) It \\"streches\\" your C++ muscles through a challenging application (The Serendipity Booksellers Application) which you develop throughout the book 6) It provides numerous (maybe too many!) exercises and programming and design challenges 7) It has, scattered throughout the book, several tips on software engineering. I really love those tips. 8) The summaries in the inside book covers 9)The book is simply great.<br />The cons of the book are few, but they must also be listed: 1) It does not highlight certain very important facts. The facts are there, but the author did not highlight them well enough. E.g you need certain header files before you can use certain library functions. Although the author stated this, he did not make the fact stand out.<br />Summary: This is a great book if you are new (or not so new) to C++, and you have a limited time to cover the essentials of the language. It is also a beautiful book to have as a reference. Overall, it is an excellent book to have.	2001-06-02

Since I have to take both Java and C++ as part of the requirements for a Masters program, I decided to learn on my own beforehand. I didn't want to start with pure C++ so I picked up this book at a local library, and so far, I have been very impressed with it. The examples are simple enough for easy digestion, and well graduated enough for those who want a little challenge. This is a book one can read and practice with over and over again. I have since decided to obtain a copy for my personal library.  This is probably the best introductory book on MS Visual C++. My next stop is Ivor Horton's &quot;Beginning Visual C++&quot;, before winding up with Tony Gardis' &quot;Starting out with C++, Alternate Edition&quot;.  The only suggestion I have for the author is that he should have included a case study which would bring all the concepts taught in the book together.  Even then, this is still a very good book.	2001-04-15

I recently used this book for an accounting class. I am not really an &quot;accounting head&quot;, having come from a computing background, and I had to do the course as a graduate degree requirement. I found the book to be very thorough and well written. The authors took their time to explain every new term throughout. The book also has numerous exercises [maybe too many]. I do not expect to &quot;do accounting&quot; in the future, but if I have to, I'll get a copy of this book again. In reading this book, I found my professor's advice quite handy: 1. start off with the learning objectives for each chapter; 2. read the chapter summary; 3. check all the diagrams in the chapter; 4. read the text; 5. practice as many exercises as you can; 6. finally, review your work. I did this and smashed the course [B+--not bad for a &quot;non-accounting head&quot;]. I found the accompanying study guide [By LeBronne Harris and James Moon] invaluable also.  This is probably the best book out there on Financial Accounting.	2001-01-10
US	51778201	R16ITDM6RDVL8X	0070215308	924090671	Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine: Companion Handbook	Books	5	1	4	N	N	authority in pocket-sized form ...	I have been using the 14th Edition of the main textbook for over two years now. The sheer size [and weight] of the book does not allow for easy carriage, especially when you have limited space. Moreover, I often had to leaf through reams of pages or read through several paragraphs when looking for information on specific topics. The companion handbook makes all these unnecessary. It is easy to carry around unnoticed in a small bag and, when there is need to double-check that elusive info, it is right there. Of course it is not as detailed as the parent text, but as a companion text, it fulfils its role very well.	2000-07-12

So far I have enjoyed the book tremendously. The outlay is great; the depth of coverage is excellent, and  it cuts to the meat of internal medicine without giving you distracting  [and often confusing] information. Whenever I wanted a general overview of  a topic, I turn to this book. For further studies, I use Harrison's. The  standard is a bit high for the average medical student though. But if you  are an intern, or an IM resident, you'll find the book an invaluable  companion.	2000-06-21

I bought this book a few weeks ago after reading the reviews on this site. This book is everything that others have written---and more! I don't know, but there seems to be something about the book that brings it to the top of  the stack. Is it the authors' style? The subject matter? The depth and  breadth of coverage? The layout of the contents? The exercises? Or a  combination of the above? If you are interested in learning ASP the easy  way, this is the book for you. You will learn all the relevant concepts  that you need to help you develop great websites without being bogged down  with confusing information. So far, this is numero uno among all my books  on ASP. The authors deserve an award for a job very well done!	2000-06-05

It is amazing that anyone would rate this book so low. While it is true that this will not be the only book on Windows 2000 you will need, it is safe to say that there is much to gain from this book. For one, it is easy  to read, is well organized, and is good value for money, IMHO. That the  contents look similar to a book on NT 4.0 holds no water: Windows 2000 IS  NT 5.0, which resembles NT 4.0 in many ways. So far, I've had no regrets.  This book is definitely not as bad as is being portrayed.	2000-05-28

If you are having trouble sleeping, get a copy of this book! It is loaded with the most potent sedatives. No, really.  I bought it as part of the Visual Studio set, and after several attempts at reading it, I still could  not point to one new thing that I gained from it. It's difficult to follow  what the author was trying to say, as he seemed to keep jumping from one  insufficiently discussed topic to another. I only hope Microsoft would  publish better books like SQL Server Database Implementation kit. I have  recently bought a copy of Visual Interdev 6 Unleashed, hoping to gain some  insight into the wealth of VID 6.0 tool.	2000-02-22

Bro Leonard did not beat about the bush. The chapters are short enough to be read in about fifteen minutes, but they are so packed that each may take  you two solid hours to read. Every chapter is thought-provoking. Since I  got the book in 1984, I have read it more than 30 times! And each time, it  appears as if I never read it before. If you would read this book, be ready  to end up upon your knees!	1999-03-30
