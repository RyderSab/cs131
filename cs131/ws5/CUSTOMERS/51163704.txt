US	51163704	R36B6S86DQ8GF0	0842365826	108364203	And the Shofar Blew	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Excellent read!	This is my first book I have read by this author.  I wasn't sure if it was going to be any good.  It sounded interesting after reading the description on the back of the book (softcover).  I took a risk and bought it.  After reading the book, it was worth it and I loved  every minute of it.  You won't be able to stop once you start to read this book.  So, make sure you have plenty of free time ahead of time. <br /> <br />It's not a romantic book.  More like a contemporary fiction with  truth from scriptures that could have happened to anybody in real life.   <br /> <br />What I like about this book is that I feel for the characters who have love for the Lord and others who have same struggles against any temptations or sins like we do in our daily lives today.  Also, the book helps remind me to keep my faith in the Lord and keep praying, giving me encouragement, and how to obey and follow the Lord the right way (God's way), not the the wrong way (Satan's way).  I can tell the author shows her love to the readers of any kind (non-Christian or Christian) through her book.  Love the Lord first and love others as second and forgive others.	2004-10-07
US	51163704	R10XIYYJ7VUOB5	1589199677	91582155	Malchus	Books	5	5	5	N	N	enjoyable to read	Interesting that author used not much used Malchus in only one verse (John 18:10) in the Bible with unknown background into a story that could have happened with some Biblical truth surrounding Jesus and scriptures interwined into a great novel.    What I like about this book is that author used characters in the story, who believed in Jesus, take a firm stand for what they believe in, no matter the circumstances to save themselves or to die for the truth and faith in Jesus.  That's one way to help and encourage the Christian readers to spread Good News as well as non-Christian readers to learn more about Jesus while it's enjoyable to read at the same time.    To learn more about truth, it's best to read from the Bible and can use this Malchus novel as reference with scriptures being used and surroundings around Jesus' life in the novel.    Updated 3/27/05  I recently ordered \\"The Witness\\" by this same author.  Be forewarned that \\"Malchus\\" was formerly titled under \\"The Witness\\".  Both are the same book.  I wasted my money on the second book.  Sounds like publisher was trying to rip off people's money?!?  I wish Amazon left description on the former title, so I wouldn't have ordered the book in the first place!	2004-09-11

Theme of this story is about betrayal as obvious by the title.  Most of the first 3/4 of the book was interesting.  I couldn't wait to find out how the story came out toward the end, but was faced with a little disappointment.  The ending could have been better.  Well, I rate this book 3-1/2 instead of 3.  &quot;Krysalis&quot; and &quot;The Tiger of Desire&quot; books are much better than this one.  I'm going to read &quot;The Tiger of Desire&quot; next for the second time now.	2004-06-19

This book has an interesting plot including two minorities like me running for President of the United States.  This novel has a good suspense on who was/were behind the abduction/kidnapping and which side (party) is/are the suspect/suspects on: Leahy's or Howe's?

For example, **** showed up a couple of times in the story and no mention about him/her at another time, what happened to him/her or what is being done for the crimes being committed (ongoing investigation) and so forth.

This is the second book I have read featuring Victoria Santos after I read UNDER COVER OF DARKNESS (also featuring Victoria Santos - cameo appearance only).  The author himself said these are the only books featuring Victoria Santos.  Read THE INFORMANT first then UNDER COVER OF DARKNESS after that.  I like THE INFORMANT a lot better because of more action (thriller).  I will look forward to reading another one of Grippando's books.  I probably will read author's first book, THE PARDON, next.	2002-12-11

Thanks to the readers who posted the excellent ratings here making my time's worth reading this book. I will look forward to reading author's other books.<br />Anyone who hasn't read THE INFORMANT, would want to read this first before reading UNDER COVER OF DARKNESS.

First half of the book was slow and not real interesting until the plot gets more interesting from second half of the book till the end.  I didn't figure out the correct suspect until I almost reached the end.  The suspense is great, but the story and wordings could have been better.  I guess that's understandable since this one was one of author's earlier books.  I hope his later books are better as other people say.	2002-11-04

I'm disappointed after I read first two good books (Tomb and Legacies).  This book doesn't really make sense with a lot of mumbo jumbo and not as interesting as the previous ones.  I just lost interested after reading a hundred pages, but forced myself to finish it as quick as I can.  It would be nice if Mr. Wilson put more variety in his novels without using Pine Barrens in each story, for ex.  Also, writing about supernatural in this Repairman Jack novel, please.  They don't really fit together with RJ character to my opinion.  Write something like in real life like Legacies or a short story in Barrens and Others.  I hope the next novels will be much better.	2002-10-07

This one is different (non-fiction) about his real son who was battling against cancer in a positive way.  That's the kind of character that God wants to see because of what Jesus did for us. <br />This is a great book for people affecting by this disease searching for positive way or needing encouragement.  This book helps me in some way by learning some medical terms that I know nothing about.<br />First couple of chapters were confusing after knowing the author, but after chapter 4, it becomes more clear and gets interesting.

It's like the author cut it short and we don't know what happened in the end (story was not 100% completed like a cliffhanger).  It's like Hitchcock movies and you have to figure out what happened to the end of the story.  I'm kind of disappointed because this was not as great as other Cook books I have read.	2002-08-08

This book keeps you second-guessing on who the actual suspect was.  I already had figured it out who during the middle of the book, but I wasn't definitely 100% sure till later because you never know the author might fool you.  That's what makes the book more interesting to read.  I enjoyed it from the beginning to end.	2002-05-08

The only thing I like about this book is suspense and Blair's character as a smart aleck and his perservance.  What I don't like about this book is that it is a slow page-turner especially from the beginning to halfway thru probably because I'm ignorant about the mine stuff.  In a small way, I felt like I was reading a literature (I have nothing against literature) or stuff I couldn't comprehend or what's it all about. Four Arkady Renko novels (Gorky Park to Havana Bay) that I have read are a lot better read than this book.  I was disappointed this one was not as interested as I thought.	2002-04-21

I  respect that.  Nothing wrong with that.  I do love mystery and suspense.  I have several favorite well-known authors.  For some reason I read this author's books (first two books of the series) and I just lost interest halfway thru the second book and didn't bother finish it.  Because I felt that the author was overdoing the character descriptions (unnecessarily wordy with characters as one of other readers had typed on the post) among other things instead of making the story itself or plot more interesting.  Who knows the books at later series are much better, I wouldn't know.	2002-04-10
