I read this book in a very short time due to the fact that I could not put it down. It is engrossing. It starts with a bang and is never dull for one minute. The story is disturbing and got under my skin. A year from now I will only remember a handful of books that I read and this will be one of them. Certain stories are like that. Being as I am from Vermont and live very close to Stowe I found it highly entertaining. I look forward to another Pam Lewis book.	2005-04-19

Did she even read it? It was lame in every way. The plot was stupid and amateurish. The way it was written was absolutely horrid and I wonder how it even got published. Donna Anders writes like she is a child. She has the child in the book speaking like an adult and the adults all speak as though it is a b movie and they have nothing to work with. The plot, which is so silly I had to laugh, does not even make any logical sense in the end. I will not comment more on it in fear of giving it away in case someone actually makes the mistake of reading this sad excuse of a book as I did.	2005-03-16

I can't believe anyone could think it was confusing or convuluted in any way. If not able to understand this book perhaps one should give up reading entirely. As for one person's review saying it was boring I had to laugh. This book is so exciting and the author so talented that I can only hope this book is first in a series. I will certainly buy the next book at hardcover price. This is like an Alex Delaware and Alan Gregory novel mixed into one, only better. This novel was written not only with wonderful character development and  fantastic plot but also with a deep understanding of human emotion. It is a deeply involved book that shows such great talent and deserves to be a bestseller.	2004-12-09

I have read every book in this series and I have to say it is the best series I have ever read besides Patricia Cornwall's Kay series. I love Antonio Burns and in this book, I got to love his brother Roberto also. We were introduced to Roberto in previous books, but never got to know him well until this installment. This book was probably the best in the series, but they are all amazing. I will read this series again and again, and this is a book worth owning at hardcover price. The author is so talented in his writing that it blows you away. He makes everything so real and exciting that all you can do is read until the end and be disappointed that the thrill is over. This is one of those rare books that I became so involved in, not only the storyline, but the characters who are so well developed, that when I had to put it down to do something in \\"real\\" life I was in a fog and disoriented because my life had become Antonio Burn's life. I could not think of anything except getting back to the book. I can't wait until his next one. This story was more emotional than his others and it had me crying more than once and even laughing. I ADORED it. You will not be disappointed.	2004-11-08

I had read this book a lot of years ago and just reread it as I am reading all of Patricia MacDonald's books again. Her books are quick easy reads that have great suspense. I think this one is one of the best. It is so shocking what Lillie has to go through with her family that I found myself getting angry. I also enjoyed the way the author portrayed Lillie's emotions and her feelings toward her family members, especially her daughter. It was very well done. I thought the ending was fine other than the fact that I was so into it that I wanted the story to never end. A great read that most will enjoy!	2004-10-05

I also have to say that above any character in a series out there, and I read many, I adore Kay above all others. I feel like I know her and her ensemble quite well after all these years. Marino, Benton and Lucy are all so interesting to me. I even gave \\"Blowfly\\" a good review as I was so happy for the return of this series. I enjoyed this book. I found it suspenseful. All the little stories within the story kept me interested and were not confusing at all. It was the last chapter that did me in. Each little subplot had unanswered questions and I felt totally cheated. The author connected everything that had happened to the same case, but never wrapped up the little details. She let the reader hang on so many things and then I found myself wondering what was the point of half of the book if she was not going to explain things at the end? What was the point of making a big deal about the games that \\"sickgirl's\\"  mother and father played if not to explain how they tied in with the case? They obviously did not tie into the case so why go on and on about them? What was the point of Lucy going to see the doctor father and finding out nothing? Did he molest his daughter or not? Why did Pogue even kill \\"sickgirl\\"? What reason did he have? It was never explained. It was farfetched that it all was tied in together anyway. I mean the guy that is after Lucy all these years later is also the killer of the girl that Kay is sent to look into? What happens to the new medical examiner that hates Kay? No mention of him, but I assume that it will continue from there so I guess that is ok. What was the point of the mother going after Marino and then acting so demented and kicking Kay out of her house, etc? What did half of this stuff have to do with anything? No questions were ever answered with any of it, but many sure were raised. I hate the feeling of leaving things undone and especially with this series as I feel like I know these people so well. The way the story ABRUPTLY stops and then goes to Kay and Benton kissing each other is silly. It will take me awhile to get over this but I will and I look forward to the next one, maybe more than ever. Oh and one more thing, does everyone always have to have a vendetta against Kay?ke I know these people so well.

I normally do not read anything but suspense and mystery. However, I loved it, so I went out and bought almost every book she has written. I have since read them all and I have to say they are all highly entertaining, but &quot;Rachel's Holiday&quot; is a step above. I adored this book. It made me laugh and cry all at the same time. It's a brilliant portrayal of humanity. It is witty, hilarious and the insight into Rachel's addiction is stunningly real. It is educational without being preachy. On another note, I love reading stories about all these sisters from the same family. Margaret (ANGELS), Claire(WATERMELON) and this one, Rachel. I hope she writes one about the most hilarious sister, Helen. Oh, I also must say this. The way Keyes develops her characters is out of this world. I could touch Simon he was so real. I LOVED him. I never wanted this book to end. She creates such realistic characters that I remember them weeks later like they were real people. I can't rave on enough about this book. It is a must read.	2004-07-01

I prefer mysteries and suspense, but I loved this book and will buy another Marian Keyes novel for sure. At first I thought it was just ok, but then I really fell in love with the characters and realized this book was about so much more. It's depth is surprising and the emotion that the author portrays is quite deep and insightful. It is laugh out loud funny in parts and heart wrenching enough in other parts to bring me to tears. I identified with each of the three women in some way. A delightful and special book.	2004-05-26

I adore this series more than any other, and was riveted by this book. I don't understand the negative reviews. The story is interesting and suspenseful and I could not put it down. So what that there are other characters. She always has lots of characters. So what that it is not always from Kay's point of view. I find it interesting as long as Kay is involved. I was thrilled that Benton was alive, and thought it to be a neat twist. I can't wait until the next in the series and hope another 2 years does not have to pass before we get one. I found Cornwell's writing style to be engaging as always and saw nothing wrong with this book. It may not be the best in the series, but I loved it and will keep it next to all her others on my shelf. The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is because there are a couple of unanswered qustions in the end and the ending seemed hurried and a bit forced.	2003-12-27

After researching melasma extensively I came across this book and its the best hope out there for us with the disease. My dermatologist offered me no hope and and a very expensive prescription. I know however that there is always an alternative to chemicals and this is the solution for this particular problem. My melasma has been such an embarassment to me. It's not life threatening, but when I can't look people in the eye any more it's humiliating. This book is worth keeping and reading over and over so you don't get discouraged while you are on the MSM. The MSM does not work over night and in my opinion works better if you change your diet and try and balance your hormones while taking it. This book gives such great advice as each of us is different. Many women write about their experience while on the MSM. If you are like me you would do just about anything to get rid of this horrible problem, so nothing is lost by buying this book.	2003-12-02

All I can say is it is by far the worst in the series. It was so boring that it took me several weeks to finish it and it was a chore. I don't know what happened, but I am surprised because usually the plot is so great in these books. I usually adore Nina, but for some reason found myself being very irked by her. The mystery was idiotic and I found myself not caring about the outcome. The only redeeming part was the chapter about the &quot;party&quot; because it was so crazy. Keeping all the families straight in my mind was hard though because I did not care enough to put any real effort into it. I think one of the biggest drawbacks in this series is the fact that all of the interesting characters have died out. I hope the next book is better and we can get back to the real Nina.	2003-11-28

I guess in some peoples' opinions that is where the real brilliance lies, but to  people like myself I don't like untidy endings. I could not put the book down, no doubt about it. I was consumed by it, just like all his novels. When I reached the last page I had to reread it because I could not believe it. I felt cheated somehow because I could not understand it. Who am I fooling? I was just plain angry. I wanted a different ending. Now, looking back, I realize that perhaps I was wrong. I am still thinking about this book that I read almost 4 months ago! How many books stay with us like that? It may be a little like the \\"Twilight Zone\\" but this book makes an impression, and is not that a sign of a great novel?	2003-11-28
US	49003287	R10EWPGJGEG4UI	0312982631	46713946	Deadly Desire	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	deliciously entertaining	I can't believe some of the dumb reviews this series has gotten. No one is pretending this series is supposed to be anything other than what it is. It is a romantic and mysterious series.  It delivers on that in a fantastic way. Miss Cahill is a very likeable character. Someone suggested she was overwrought. Well, she is 20 years old and it is 1902, so seeing some of the shocking things she has encountered would cause that, especially in one so innocent. I find her endearing and would be very sad indeed were she any other way. She also has fallen in love for the first time in her life, so I would imagine she is going to have Mr. Bragg on her mind alot. Especially since this is a romance series. The mysteries are good, they keep me guessing. The...[extreme] chemistry between the characters is stunning and provacative. I love the triangle of Calder, Francesca, and Rick Bragg. I am not usually a big fan of romance, but Brenda Joyce has a way of writing that is very addicitive. At least in this series. I do not like her modern novels as well. This series is a guilty little pleasure one should allow themself, like a soap opera. It is not meant to be serious or brilliant, but in a way it is quite intelligent just fot the simple fact that it can whisk one away with such force. Is'nt that the point of reading sometimes? There is nothing like a good escape. Not every book is meant to make us think or expand our horizons for goodness sake. Anyone who does not like these books probably is not the type to sit in a hot bath and eat chocolates... If that is what you like, then read these books beginning with the first. You will not be disappointed.	2003-10-25

I adored Griffin, the cop in charge of the investigation. I hope she brings him back in another book one day!! The story itself was  intricate and well written. Everything was explained neatly in the end and nothing was left hanging. I like that. The suspense was mighty and the romance kept to a minimum. I like that, too. But best of all this story was poignant and I was in tears much of the time. With the death of Griffin's wife, Carol's messed up marriage, Meg's messed up family, and the effect the rapes had on these victims, this was a very meaningful and sensitive book. I thought Ms. Gardner portrayed these emotions brilliantly. It is a deep, and sometimes raw read that leaves you feeling very sympathetic to a rape victim. This is one of the best books I have ever read and it ranks up there with a Joy Fielding novel. It has all the elements I enjoy in a story and I highly recommend it!	2002-07-16

It is a good quick read about three young ladies who, under different circumstances, get lured to a small inn on an island in Massachusetts. They have all been targeted by a sicko who is out for revenge. Things are made worse when there is a big storm and the girls are stuck on the island for the weekend.  It is creepy and entertaining like most of Ms. Staub's novels. It is very much like a Carlene Thompson novel. Worth a read but not earth shattering.	2002-02-11

It is, as the title would suggest, a dark read. However, it is brilliantly suspenseful and impossible to put down. Charlie &quot;Bird&quot; Parker is a guy out to find justice and if he has to get rid of a few bad guys along the way then so be it. He is making the world a safer place and I like the whole theme this author is using. His work reminds me of a Dennis LeHane novel in many ways. In this story the hunt for the Caleb Kyle monster is very intriguing and scary. I found it to be thrilling and I hated for the story to ever end. It all wraps up neatly in the end and is easy to understand. I like a mystery that leaves no loose ends. Unlike his first novel it does not ramble on about unimportant things and I did not skim through any parts. It is a delicious read with plenty of deep emotion to contemplate on. The author has a great talent for bringing the characters to life. I found myself feeling as if I knew them. I can't wait until his next novel!	2002-01-28

If you plan to read this book you had better make sure you are able to do so without any interruptions.  The reasons being, it is very detailed and it is also very involved for the reader. You won't want distractions of any sort as there are many characters and an intricate plot. These are all good things. This is not a light read and in many ways the style of writing reminds me of a Dennis Lehane novel. It is dark and gruesome but worth the effort. Charlie Parker is a meaty character and a bit scary. He is also likeable. His quest to find many different people ends up being connected which makes the storyline much more understandable. At first it is a bit confusing as the reader thinks too many things are going on. The author also switches from present tense to past and so you have to keep up. Each character that is introduced has a lengthy life story and I found myself skimming at times as I did not even care. I just wanted the meat of the story. However, I ended up going back as I missed important details at times, and things have to make sense and come together for me to enjoy a book. This book could have been trimmed down but all in all it was a very suspensful and exciting read. I will read his next novel.	2001-12-06

Each of the sister's lives, not to mention all the other characters, really kept me in suspense. The fued between the Taggerts and the Hollands was interesting. The only reason I can't rate this book higher is because the sex gets to be too much. Everyone is constantly having sex and the graphic nature of it gets to be tedious and boring.  Each encounter is the same and I found myself skimming the sex parts to get to the meat of the story.  I mean, who cares? I enjoy a good mystery and this story has murder, suspense, romance, the works, but the sex is way overdone. This is the second Lisa Jackson book I have read and it seems as though she tries too hard to throw that in when in reality it is not necessary for a good story. Leaving a little to the imagination is a good thing sometimes.	2001-11-26

I have always enjoyed Tess Gerritsen's books as they are always suspenseful. I like a good medical thriller and I consider her to be one of the best when it comes to that genre.  I believe she deserves more recognition for her talent. She also throws in a bit of romance and out of all the authors that once wrote Harlequin Romances, she is by far one of the best.  This book sucks you into the life of a doctor named Catherine and a killer that is out to get her. It is very scary and realistic. It is a race against time to find the killer and I became very involved with the characters. It is a fast, thrilling read and worth hardcover price!!	2001-09-06

I have read both of Donna Ander's other thrillers, &quot;The Flower Man&quot; and &quot;Dead Silence&quot; but this book is far better. Even though they were both suspensful, they were not as well written as this book. This book is so superior in it's writing that it is hard to believe the same author created it. The characters are well developed and the protagonist, Sharon, is so loveable. I found myself rooting for her and almost crying out when I thought her evil husband, Paul, would catch her at something she was not supposed to be doing! This was an intense read and I could not put it down! I never wanted it to end and the characters became as real people to me. That is a sign of a great book.

I thought I would enjoy a series about a psychiatrist who gets himself involved in a mystery as I love a Stephen White or a Jonathan Kellerman novel so much. Unfortunately, Harry Kline is not as enjoyable to read about as Alan Gregory or Alex Delaware. The mystery itself was not bad but it was all the other stuff that I disliked about this book. I had to skim many parts as I did not find myself fascinated by the history of Boston or Harry's religious wonderings and beliefs(or lack of). I just wanted the darn mystery and found his meanderings quite frustrating and boring. His girlfriend, Veronica, is not even likeable or believable. Why would anyone wait 21 years to go in search of a killer? That is just plain dumb. Especially for someone who is in law enforcement. I may try another Harry Kline novel as perhaps I started with the wrong one. I may end up liking them all better under different circumstances(the characters that is). I will let you know...	2001-08-19

The whole gambling idea was pure genius in my opinion and well researched. The authors totally pulled it off and made it fly. The characters, as always, are believable and likeable. The romance between Paul and Nina is well written. Nina is my favorite female protagonist along with Gail Connor from the Barbara Parker series and I enjoyed this book immensely!

I happened to find it entertaining and I liked Sarah a lot. This is the first Lynn Erickson book I have ever read and now I am reading &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot; which I am enjoying. This team of two women authors write well and their characters are likeable and their plots seem to be well thought out and researched. I find their writing style quite good and better than many others in their same genre(mystery-romance). Some mystery romance writers, especially ones that wrote Harlequin Romances at one time, seem shallow in comparison. I will definitely read a third book by this duo and look forward to it!	2001-08-05

I have read this whole &quot;Anne&quot; series three times and plan on reading them again one day. They are true classics and I think you are missing out on one of life's pleasures if you do not read these books! They are my favorites as they make me laugh, cry and all in all feel a little different about life. Yes, one could say they are life altering. I want my daughter to read these books. These are treasures that should be handed down from generation to generation. Reading a book by Ms. Montgomery is a gift that one should be thankful for. Anne is such a wonderful character that she becomes your friend and you will never forget her. The daily life of Anne seems pretty simple but yet it is riveting and you never want to stop reading about her. Each character is brought to life in such a way that you marvel at the talent this author had. It is one of those rare books that you must stop reading periodically to catch your breath and I found myself reading certain parts over and over. I highly recommend this series to young and old alike as it is timeless! Is it not amazing how this author had to use no bad language, graphic, shocking violence or sexuality to create a riveting story? She writes only of a young orphan girl's life and those she encounters along the way and we are mesmerized. Not many authors like that any more.	2001-08-05

They were shallow and weak and if Dave had called Liza &quot;Brown Eyes&quot; one more time I think I would have screamed!

I have to say this is, so far, my favorite of Carlene Thompson's books. They are all great but for some reason this one stands out. I really loved Nicole, the protagonist. She is going through a divorce from a self-absorbed jerk and that aspect of her life is very interesting.  Her relationship with her mom is also entertaining and then of course there is the mystery part of the story! So all at once there are all these different angles and I found this novel to a bit more in depth than some of Carlene Thompson's novels.  She always portrays a lot of great characters, but this novel seems to explore a bit more of each of their lives. You will surely not be disappointed as the suspense builds and there are a whole lot of suspects.  Greatly entertaining and consuming. I highly recommend!!	2001-07-16

I loved this book as much as I did &quot;The Quiet Game&quot; and that is saying a lot. I never wanted this book to end. I loved Jordan, the protagonist, very much and am awed by how Mr. Iles can portray a woman. Her name, Jordan Glass, made me wonder if Greg Iles might be the infamous author that has written the Susan Shader series, but I don't know. Like I mentioned, he sure is adept at getting inside a woman's mind like the author is in that series... Anyway, this book is remarkable as you never know what is going to happen next and the characters have such depth. Mr. Iles writes pure quality novels that make a lot of bestselling authors seem rather, well, shallow. This is a very meaty and thrilling story and I  guarantee that once you begin reading you won't want to stop!	2001-07-14

The characters were great and the mystery kept you guessing throughout the whole story.  This was the first book Carlene Thompson ever published and what a great first novel.  How talented she is. It is scary enough to thrill but not too overdone.  I like the way this author always introduces so many characters into her plots that they all begin to look suspicious and so you are never sure until the end.  That is a sign of a good &quot;whodunit&quot;. I highly recommend this book.	2001-07-03

I loved this book until I reached the last page and then I wanted to cry out in frustration! This book kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.  The suspense just builds and builds and you keep thinking things are wrapping up too neatly and something awful is going to happen.  I could not even guess as to what it could be but when I finally found out I was disappointed.  The ending just does not seem to go with the rest of the story.  It is very off and not believable and I felt cheated.  Otherwise I enjoyed the book immensely.  I found some parts to be a bit dull about the DNA and the repetition of  Ms. Harding's deeds but all in all a commendable first novel.  I look forward to reading &quot;THE HUNTED&quot; and hope the ending is better.	2001-06-13

I just completed the &quot;KAY SCARPETTA&quot; series for the second time and let me tell you, it was awesome!! The only thing I did differently was I read them in order.  This book, &quot;POSTMORTEM&quot; is first in the series and it is suspensful and absolutely thrilling.  You really fall for the protagonist, Kay, and want to read for the sake of learning about her life as well as for solving the mystery.  Patricia Cornwell is a most talented author.  She draws you in like no other and I am always sorry when one of her books (this series only) end.  Her books can be dark and a bit gruesome, but they are not overly disturbing as they have such redeeming qualities.  The horror described  is for a reason and goes with the territory of Kay's career.  It is never just to shock like some books.  Kay is an honorable lady, and very complex. The mysteries and scandals she is involved in make you feel like you are involved too. They are very consuming and entertaining.  Be prepared to put everything aside when you pick up this book!!	2001-06-12

How any one that enjoys legal thrillers could not be crazy about this book I do not know!!  The whole Paul Madrianni Series is great.  If you want to get the best effect you need to begin with this one.  It is suspenseful, exciting and full of courtroom drama.  The personal side of the protagonist is very interesting also, and he is a likeable guy.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who reads John Grisham or Lisa Scottoline.  They are meatier,grittier and a bit darker.	2001-06-09

It says it is the first in the series, but I just picked up another book by the name of \\"Weatherby\\" and it introduces Artie Weatherby for the first time so I guess this is actually the second about this private eye!

It's an easy read and such fun!! I fell in love with &quot;Red&quot; more than any of the  other Erica Spindler characters.  She is a kind and innocent child who you get to see grow into a beautiful woman and  you can't help but root for her.  I could'nt put the book down because I had to see her prevail over all her enemies.  I have read almost all of Erica Spindler's books but this is my absolute favorite by far!  You get so involved in her life that you just can't stop reading. I usually prefer mystery and suspense but this is a swell book.  It will keep you interested until the end!	2001-06-06

It was interesting but not overwhelmingly so.  It is too similar in it's storyline to many of her other books, but without the redeeming qualities.  Most, if not all,  of her books involve females falling helplessly in love with the men they hate but this main character, Skye, was not likeable enough to make it all fly.  She was a real whiner! Usually Ms. Spindler creates loveable characters.  I don't know what happened here.	2001-06-06

Just like the ones I love to sink my teeth into!  I don't think I have come across a lawyer protagonist I liked quite this much since Rudy Baylor in John Grishams's &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;.  You can't help but adore Victor Carl in this story. Perhaps some of his goals lack sensitivity but you know that deep down, Victor is an honorable man and sure enough, by the end of the book even he realizes it.  The suspense of the story is riveting, the characters are very real and there are enough twists and turns in the story to keep you intrigued.  But the best thing about this book is it's depth and it's quality.  I can't fully explain it, but it makes most lawyer type thrillers seem shallow in comparison.  Sometimes I had to reread a passage and just stop to think about what was going on, but that is a sign of a great read, in my opinion.  It is a delicious story and a one you just want to savor,so to speak.  When you are done you sure want more of Victor Carl and I can't wait to read the next in the series.  I hope Mr. Lashner is working hard on a third!!	2001-06-04

I could not wait to read this novel as I enjoyed the first in the series(&quot;EYES&quot;) so very much.  However, I did not enjoy this one quite as much.  I really like the protaganist, Dr. Susan Shader, but this novel was not as deeply moving.  It was gruesome and disturbing, which I can handle, as one of my most favorite series is the Kay Scarpetta novels, but it felt  a bit ugly.  It was almost at times too focused on the shocking sickness of this individual. Dr. Shader rambles on a bit with a lot of psychobabble and I found myself skimming... I can't quite put my finger on it, but it seemed to lack the depth and sensitivity the first one had.  Let's put it this way: I remember the first one clearly and I read it long before this one and this one is already getting fuzzy.	2001-06-04

I feel like the ending was not only a total surprise(I never had a clue)but that the author wrapped it up neatly and explained everything rather well.  The only thing she failed to explain was why Ray Raintree escaped from the courtroom after sentencing if he was so eager to go to jail to escape the villian.  He had not been sentenced to death yet, so that kind of irked me.  It was a slow story in spots and I skimmed a coupla times, but all in all it was pretty interesting and I liked Marie. Will I read her next book in this series?  I may, but I am not dying to get my hands on it like some series.	2001-05-31

It is an easy and a fast read as it's hard to put down.  It reminds me a bit of his novel &quot;Found Money&quot; in the fact that Nick Rey finds himself uncovering secrets about his father's life that had been kept from him.  It explores the father- son relationship in a very similar way as did the other novel. It makes one wonder how much do we ever really know our parents?  Mr. Grippando always seem to throw a bit of romance in and does a swell job of it too. To me the most amazing thing about this book though are the facts about Columbia.  I will certainly never go there!! All in all I found the kidnap thing very effective.  Great read!!	2001-05-23

It was in my recommendations and I was a bit hesitant about buying it but I thought what the heck, I'll give it a shot.  I am sooo glad I did, as it was one of those books I could not put down.  It is engrossing and suspensful.  I fell in love with Dr. Susan Shader and there is such depth in her relationship with her son that the authoor is very perceptive in portraying.  As a parent I felt her pain and really could not believe how adept Mr. Glass was in making me feel a lot of things throughout the whole book.  It is so much more than just a thriller although it does that well too.  Very deep and moving and anyone who did not enjoy this book must be made of stone.  It shows a real sensitivity that a lot of books lack and I can't wait to read his next novel, &quot;Blood&quot;.	2001-05-07

It grabbed me from the beginning and never let go.  Fabulous!! There are many great authors but Mr. Lehane stands out.  I never wanted this book to end.  I fell for the characters and was consumed by the plot.  I think it was his best book to date and I think that everytime he comes out with a new one.  How does he keep doing it?  I can't say enough about this book.  It's dark and profound like all of his books and very moving.  I was deeply touched by it and am amazed at the insight this author has.  The only thing that was not my favorite was the ending.  It just seemed to fall a bit flat after one heck of a story.  I mean what was up with Jimmy's wife saying &quot;We're strong and they are weak&quot; as an answer to Jimmy's conscience bothering him over what he had just done? I liked the fact that he was struggling with his deed and her dismissing it like that seemed to go against the grain of the story somehow.  It just ended a bit oddly but maybe I'm just mad it ended....	2001-04-24

This book was supposed to be one of those that was impossible to put down but I was'nt able to keep it up!! I really tried, thinking it's bound to get better, but let's just say it's not worth the effort.  I read a lot of books and I love courtroom drama, but I was not able to even like this father and daughter lawyer duo at all. The plot is so slow and boring. The only other book I have read by this author was her book &quot;The Good Children&quot; and it read like something one would read in high school, which is fine if you're in high school,but I am not.  I tried one of her legal thrillers as they are all hyped to be so great but I will not waste money on another.  Very disappointing. If you want a great courtroom thriller try a Barbara Parker book.	2001-04-23

It was not only the best book Joy Fielding has  ever written but one of the best books I have ever read.  I like Joy Fielding books and have read all of them and this one by far is her deepest.  Her others are a much lighter read and although they are enjoyable (especially See Jane Run) this one she outdid herself with and I feel it deserves recognition.  It is a much better read than a Danielle Steele novel.  It is worth paying hardcover price!! Each character was interesting in this story but Mattie and her daughter Kim were so heartfelt in their relationships and struggles.  The way that the author explained Mattie's disease was so easy to understand as she kept it simple but explained it fully.  I of course hated Jake and the way he was so selfish but by the end of the book I felt differently.  I loved every part of this book, even the ending. If you like a heartfelt, meaningful story about family and tragedy, you will love this book.	2001-03-13

Her relationship with Anthony is so well written. The chemistry between those two is so exciting and always in each book there is great suspense.  I anxiously look forward to another book.  I highly recommend you start with the first book in the series though to get the full effect. Otherwise it get's confusing because you will want to truly understand Gail's relationship not only to Anthony but to her ex husband, Dave. Parker is good at spinning a mystery and I can never put her books down. A great read!	2001-02-20

Nina is easy to love and her life is quite interesting.  If you like the Barbara Parker's Gail Connor series you'll like these books. This book is just a bit slower than some of the later ones.

I have read all of his books and I am a huge fan of legal thrillers, but this book was one of his best.  I also enjoyed The Testament.  I like it when he writes something other than legal thrillers and am tired of him being criticized for it.  He is so very talented and this book will touch your heart.  If it does not then there is a problem.  Who would think that little Luke Chandler could have such an interesting life?  Why this story kept me so enthralled I truly can't explain but I could not put this book down.  I was hooked from the first page, and I have to admit that Grisham's books usually take a few pages to capture me.  The only bad thing about this book was it ended too soon.  I want to know how little Luke grew up and  what happened to Pappy  and the farm.  This is one of those rare stories that stay with you for days and the characters refuse to let go.  This story made me laugh and cry.  Grisham is skilled at making  the story so vividly  alive that each emotion is fully experienced and each part of the story fully experienced.  I  hope he continues writing  like this!	2001-02-18

Lehane's books show a real darkside of human nature and are a bit disturbing  but the way the main character, Patrick Kenzie fights the depravity makes up for it.  He is tired of his fight against evil and the way it has jaded him. He will continue it though as he feels it is his duty and it is all he knows.  He has many personal demons and his kind of sarcastic take on things is likeable. I enter a whole different world when I pick up a Dennis Lehane book.  Patrick Kenzie is a rough but honorable man on his search for justice- much more than an average private investigator.	2001-02-18

However, I have to agree with a couple of the other reviewers that reading them in order is best.  I failed to do so and one day when I have forgotten the details I will read his  whole series from beginning to end.  They are that good. In Priviledged Information  we are introduced to Alan Gregory who is a very interesting character.  This book is a real thriller and very suspenseful.  I could not put it down like all of White's books.  I find his books every bit as good as Jonathan Kellerman's.  Perhaps more so as his relationships with others are explored more  deeply than Alex Delaware's.	2001-02-18

He is so talented and oh, what an imagination! This book was very humorous in spots and had me laughing outloud.  I found it to be a bit sluggish in spots but the love of the characters made up for it.  Especially Barty who was so kind he brought tears to my eyes.  The sensitivity Koontz expresses  with his books is what makes me read him.  I hate for people to even compare him with the likes of Stephen King or other horror writers as he is so much more than that.  I enjoy the way Koontz creates both good and evil in his books and the good always overcomes, whether the evil is of a spiritual nature, an alien nature, or real flesh and blood. By the way his flesh and blood evil stories are the best as they are the most believable-like False Memory.  You will adore the many characters in this story, even the villian in a way!! He is the most fun to read about. The way his logic works is hilarious.  This is not Koontz's best book but somewhere in the middle.	2001-02-18

It's been about a year since I finished this book and I still fondly remember it.  It will be a book I read again one day.  Lu Ann is one of the greatest characters I have ever met!  When an author enables you to not only enter another world but to make a bond with a charachter (or characters) it is truly genius.  For me, this was such a book.  I have read every book Mr. Baldacci has ever written, and this one stands out.  He is a great storyteller.  I was sad when the book ended and I thought of it for a long time afterwards.  I read a lot of books and when I can remember one a year later it had to have made quite an impression.	2000-12-04
