His Factory series of crime novels is not for the squeamish. \\"A State of Denmark,\\" originally published in 1970, predates the Factory series and has a different theme that at the time must have resonated in England, with its strong economic regulation and, in many quarters, embrace of socialism, disdain for capitalism, and belief that individual liberty was a dubious idea, quaint, outdated, and inefficient, and at best to be tolerated as long as it did not interfere with collective goals.<br /><br />In brief, England is ruled by a leftist dictator named Jobling who has turned the country into a vicious totalitarian state. Jobling governs through a melange of fascism, socialism, and brutal oppression, all made possible by a cult of personality that surrounds him following a coup d'&eacute;tat that England's bourgeoisie have spinelessly accepted and the working class have welcomed.<br /><br />So far, so good. And it's very well-written, with wonderful imagery throughout. The problem is the implausibility of the plot. The main character, Richard Watt, and his companion, Magda Carson, have fled England and developed a vineyard in rural Italy. He is a hardy character who, as a journalist in England, battled Jobling and after Jobling's coup found himself unemployed and unemployable. Yet for implausible reasons he and Magda accept Italian orders to quit their voluntary exile and return to the bleakness of England, where they meet a fate that the reader will discover. It's impossible to accept that such a resolute and stalwart character would put his life and liberty in jeopardy by doing so. Rather, he'd be arranging passage to Brazil or Australia. The other implausibility is that the Italian government would be so afraid of Jobling that it would issue the deportation orders. The England of \\"A State of Denmark\\" is hardly the Germany of \\"The Garden of the Finzi-Contini,\\" able to persuade the Italian authorities to round people up and ship them to concentration camps. It is an economic basket case that is unable to feed and clothe its own people and is surrounded by enemies. Watt's and Italy's capitulations to Jobling require too much suspension of disbelief.-Contini,\\" able to persuade the Italian authorities to round people up and ship them to concentration camps.

Miller, Jr., Robert Heinlein's \\"Farnham's Freehold,\\" Pat Frank's \\"Alas Babylon,\\" and even, in certain respects, Robin Cook's \\"Chromosome 6,\\" all essentially science fiction novels. Not to mention sci-fi films like the entertaining 1971 B movie \\"The Omega Man,\\" starring Charleston Heston, and the fine and unheralded 1985 New Zealand movie \\"The Quiet Earth.\\" So it's curious that Atwood insists, in an epilogue, that \\"'Oryx and Crake' is a speculative fiction, not a science fiction proper\\" (p. 382), when it fits so well into the sci-fi genre. I've heard that acclaimed writers tend to regard genre fiction as a lesser art form and prefer to disassociate themselves from it; perhaps this is an example. If so, it's unfortunate, for the best genre writing is first-rate literature.<br /><br />Whether or not \\"Oryx and Crake\\" is properly labeled science fiction, it's very good. It won't give away too much of the plot to say that a series of major and minor catastrophes have befallen the earth and that the main character, the Snowman (a/k/a Jimmy), is eking out a subsistence existence in the rubble. The events that led to disaster are nicely chronicled, with subtle foreshadowing that increases the sense of foreboding in the flashback chapters.<br /><br />It also seems prescient. The French-language CBC News (Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Radio-Canada) last night had a chilling story on the effects of genetically modified soybeans on the Argentine economy and environment. According to the report, one-half of Argentina's arable land has been given over to soybean cultivation, almost all of genetically modified crops, making plenty of money for a certain class of growers while damaging agriculture, killing wildlife, sickening a number of Argentines, and driving unemployed and destitute farmworkers into cities (what Atwood, in \\"Oryx and Crake,\\" calls the \\"pleeblands.\\") The Radio-Canada story brings home that \\"Oryx and Crake\\" is good science fiction because it's believable. As an skeptic of modern environmentalist fundamentalism, I am saddened by the descent of mainstream environmental groups into an unpersuasive form of latter-day eschatology. Their doomsday scenarios are lucrative for them, I'm sure, but usually rely on bad science and deaden society to plausible menaces like global warming. Atwood avoids these problems and lays out a vision of the future that is plausible because it's based on scientific trends and the imbalance between technological advance and the primitive regions of the human mind. Well worth reading.blands.\\") The Radio-Canada story brings home that \\"Oryx and Crake\\" is good science fiction because it's believable.

This is a first-rate addition to the upper tier of Saramago's works.<br /><br />In the Nov. 8, 2004, issue of \\"The American Conservative\\" magazine, the managing editor, Kara Hopkins, advocated not voting in the pending presidential election. \\"Silence is a profound expression,\\" she argued, \\"and enough unraised voices eventually turn even the most partisan heads.\\" \\"Elections,\\" she contended, \\"maintain the illusion of opposing parties exchanging ideas rather than political animals competing for power. Selling voting as the ultimate expression of citizenship . . . legitimizes the process that keeps them in control and makes the public docile by enforcing the notion that we rule ourselves.\\"<br /><br />It is as if she read Saramago's mind, or vice-versa. In \\"Essay on Lucidity,\\" some 70 percent of the residents of the capital of an unnamed country (presumably European, but, Saramago announces sardonically, not Portugal) turn in blank ballots in an election, refusing to vote for the Party of the Right, the Party of the Center, or the Party of the Left. The government, dominated by unsavory and unprincipled authoritarians, is horrified that the fa√ßade of democracy has broken down and orders the election to be reheld. But the percentage of blank votes is higher than before.<br /><br />The government's reaction, though often fumbling, is vicious and lethal. It uses various Orwellian techniques and, as it deems necessary, violence to punish the capital's residents and try to return them to the fold. Saramago narrates events at a languid pace, sometimes using his long commentaries disarmingly to hide some horror that may be announced in a single sentence at the end of an anodyne, soothing paragraph.<br /><br />This is a fable. It is not intended to be entirely realistic, and the reader must suspend disbelief at times. In the real world, a European country that took Draconian measures against its citizens for refusing to vote would be subject to various external sanctions and pressures and would have to back down. From 1993-1997 Canada tolerated having as its official opposition the Bloc Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois, whose goal is to dissolve the country. But Saramago is so masterly a writer that he makes the implausible possible. The reader does soon ask, \\"Why would any government that observes the forms of democracy behave this way?\\" A plot twist that appears in the middle of the novel provides an answer. I've already seen too many reviews give it away, and I'm not going to follow suit.<br /><br />In \\"Essay on Lucidity,\\" Saramago continues his dance with the Portuguese language in ways that are charming. Even more than in \\"The Cave,\\" his characters speak a Portuguese that is so formal as to exceed the tone of much formal writing. If anyone spoke this way in Brazil, he or she either would not be understood or would be regarded as mannered and pompous. That would probably also be true even in the most educated circles of Portuguese society. But Saramago's use of the King's Portuguese doesn't come across as pretentious; rather, it's a celebration of the outer reaches of classic Portuguese. I often think that Saramago's goal is to restore a full-fledged type of Portuguese that is fading, perhaps thanks to an onslaught of televised soap operas and the like. Like Shakespeare, whose facility with language and extraordinary vocabulary altered English forever, Saramago may succeed in elevating Portuguese to a language different from the form that preceded his literary career. That would have to be the supreme achievement of any writer of literature.European country that took Draconian measures against its citizens for refusing to vote would be subject to various external sanctions and pressures and would have to back down.

Rather, it combines all three, creating a whole that is more than the sum of its parts, a vivid, impressionistic tableau of Brazilian life and culture in which Robb interlaces past and present in a compelling, sometimes seamless manner.<br /><br />If you've spent much time in Brazil, Robb's brushstrokes of local color will bring back many memories. In my case, \\"A Death in Brazil\\" evoked a scary taxi ride in Maceio in Brazil's northeast in 1989; the mold encrusting the walls of a cheap hotel in Salvador in 1984, flavoring the room with a smell that I can still detect almost as soon as I set foot in the country; the protests for eleicoes direitas ja (direct elections now) in 1984, toward the end of military rule. Even the cover photo, of old pastel houses and people lingering aimlessly in their doorways to escape the stifling indoor heat, brings back memories of Rio de Janeiro's Gloria neighborhood, where in 1984 my hotel charged U.S. $3.20 a day for a room with intermittent air conditioning (depending on the mood of the reception desk) and private bath (thankfully with a gas-powered hot shower, rather than the uncertain chuveiro eletrico with wires dangling ominously behind the shower head, which always forced a choice between the promise of hot water and the possibility of sudden electrocution). The last time I was in Rio, in 2000, the hotel was more like $40 a day, and it had installed bulletproof glass to protect the reception desk from street crime. Armed violence is now a serious problem in urban Brazil; the urbane news presenter Boris Casoy devotes much of the Record Network television news to it. I went to Brazil twice in 2000, but a daily dose of the \\"Jornal da Record\\" newscast on satellite TV is scaring me from returning.<br /><br />For those who know little about the country, much of what Robb describes may seem mysterious, as though he were venturing into the Africa of Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness.\\" Speaking of which, Robb's encyclopedic knowledge encompasses a mention of Conrad's voyage to the Congo River on the \\"Ville de Maceio\\" in 1890, and allows him to bring in figures ranging from Roger Casement to Fernando Ramos da Silva, the star of the critically acclaimed 1981 movie \\"Pixote, a lei do mais fraco.\\"<br /><br />Not only is Robb extremely knowledgeable, but his writing is first-rate (why does the British Commonwealth continue to produce so much fine and subtle writing?). He fills his narrative with imagery like this: \\"It was dark now, so damp the air was palpable, and silent outside. The smell of rank plaster filled the little room. It was peeling off the blue-washed walls in foamy patches. . . . In the world outside a fine and soundless rain was falling and a scarf of tiny droplets floated under the bulb of a yellow streetlight.\\" (Pp. 305-306.)<br /><br />Robb's political perspective is to the left of mine and probably that of most American readers. As a result, I occasionally found fault with aspects of his book. Robb rhapsodizes over Lula (Luis Inacio Lula da Silva), the current Brazilian president, but suggests, explicitly or implicitly, that Lula's predecessor, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, was a neoliberal who did much to placate international capital and little to ease Brazil's vast disparities in wealth and income. I think the election of Lula is of enormous historical importance and has the potential to bring revolutionary change to relations between the developed and less-developed worlds. But I regret the portrayal of Cardoso, a distinguished centrist whose achievements include taming inflation, an astonishing feat that benefits Lula's administration every day. The Brazilian currency, the real, is essentially stable against the U.S. dollar, and that too is thanks to Cardoso, and to Lula's continuation of many of Cardoso's policies.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Robb's ruminations on Brazilian society, culture, andmores are among the best I've read, and I highly recommend \\"A Death in Brazil.\\"lture, and mores are among the best I've read, and I highly recommend \\"A Death in Brazil.\\"	2004-08-13

Buell Quain, a North Dakotan, committed suicide in northern Brazil in the company of the aboriginal Krah√¥ tribe he was studying. &quot;Buell Quain killed himself on the night of August 2, 1939,&quot; writes Carvalho--&quot;the same day that Albert Einstein sent President Roosevelt the historic letter in which he alerted him to the possibility of the atomic bomb.&quot; (P. 15.) Quain died at age 27, and although the gruesome manner of his suicide is documented, the reasons for it remain mysterious.<br />Carvalho becomes obsessed with discovering more about the reasons for Quain's premature demise, and &quot;Nove Noites&quot; is a narrative of his investigation coupled (in the sections printed in italics) with fictional speculation about why he might have ended his life when his future as a distinguished anthropologist seemed so assured. Suspense builds as Carvalho travels to Krah√¥ territory in remote northern Brazil and to New York City in an effort to tease out information that might lead to an explanation of Quain's death and, by extension, his philosophy of life.<br />Unfortunately, as far as I know &quot;Nove Noites&quot; hasn't been translated into English, and I'm not sure that any of Carvalho's work has. Someone should undertake this task. At a minimum, this is the most captivating biographical work I've ever read about anyone who hailed from North Dakota--imagine that it should come from Brazil! Carvalho's descriptions of Quain's family members and their role as prominent early citizens of Bismarck, N.D., although brief, ought to be interesting to those who want to learn more about North Dakota history.<br />Carvalho occasionally philosophizes on contemporary issues, and one phrase is particularly memorable. Speaking of September 11, 2001, and its aftermath, he says, &quot;Hoje as guerras parecem mais pontuais, quando no fundo s√£o permanentes.&quot; (I.e., &quot;Wars today seem to occur at a more precise point in time, but deep down they are permanent.&quot;) (P. 13.)guerras parecem mais pontuais, quando no fundo s√£o permanentes.&quot; (I.e., &quot;Wars today seem to occur at a more precise point in time, but deep down they are permanent.&quot;) (P. 13.)	2004-04-25

But there's a notable flaw that I hope DeLorme will correct in future printings. The atlas shows many spots, represented by a black diamond as a &quot;City or Town&quot; according to the key on the inside front cover, that are no such thing. Some of those places are deserted. Others may have a house or two but no services. You may run out of gas if you rely solely on this atlas.<br />Take, for example, page 62 in the current edition. The hamlet of Hiko is listed in large type; you'd think it has every convenience. But the 2000-2001 edition of the Nevada Official Highway Map, published by the state's department of transportation, shows that Hiko has no services at all. On the same page of the atlas you'll find Logan and Crescent. Neither &quot;City or Town&quot; appears on the official highway map, and the atlas itself shows that Crescent connects to the outside world by the tiniest road -- probably a rough dirt track. On the facing page (page 63) you'll find Uvada, in large type, just across the Utah state line. The last time I drove by Uvada, in 2001, the place consisted of a railroad siding; I didn't see a single dwelling, much less any services.<br />Similarly, roads that appear to be modern thoroughfares according to the key are sometimes not paved. If you're familiar with Nevada, you'll know instinctively which ones are likely to be and which are not. But if you're visiting from New York or California, again beware.<br />Outside of Reno, the Carson City-Lake Tahoe area, and Las Vegas, Nevada is spectacularly empty, with lonely, starlit, sometimes snowy valleys that may contain a few hundred people in an area the size of Connecticut. Public services in those places are few and far between. Most roads are unpaved. Do not rely on the DeLorme atlas for the location of urban amenities, or even a gas station. Rather, obtain the official state road map. The 2000-2001 version that I have shows which places have services and which do not. And it shows which roads are paved and which likely are not.<br />These comments pertain to the third edition (2000) of the atlas.

Why it does this I don't know, given that the Nevada and Colorado DeLorme atlases use feet. Because the U.S. remains committed to standard English measures rather than the metric system, presumably most users will want to work in feet and will have altimeters and global positioning devices set to the English system. It's irritating to have to convert to meters when using the atlas.<br />These comments pertain to the fifth edition, second printing (2000), of the atlas.

If this mat&eacute;riel does exist, Brown has accomplished a remarkable feat of research in discovering it, and it's worth reading \\"Deception Point\\" just for the descriptions of it.<br />The novel's relentless pace and plot twists furnish another reason to recommend it. Other Amazon.com reviews have already touched on this point, so I will not explore it further in mine. In general, though, they make it possible to recommend \\"Deception Point\\" with enthusiasm.<br />\\"Deception Point\\" is not perfect. It's implausible in two respects that I want to mention here.<br />First, the characters perform feat after feat of extraordinary ingenuity, cheating death time and again. At points the novel becomes cartoon-like in this respect. But it's well-written and engaging enough that I think most readers will happily suspend disbelief, allowing themselves to be carried along as a vivid chain of events spools out.<br />Second, the plot of \\"Deception Point\\" relies on extensive American operations on, and removal of a priceless physical object from, Ellesmere Island in the high arctic. The novel treats Ellesmere Island as if it were U.S. territory, and as if U.S. government agencies could do what they want there unnoticed and without interference.<br />In reality, Ellesmere Island is part of Canada; it lies in the territory of Nunavut (itself formerly part of the Northwest Territories). The northernmost island in the high Canadian arctic, it has a Canadian military station (the outpost of Alert) and a tiny civilian community (Grise Fiord or Aujuittuq). (Ellesmere Island lies only about 14 miles (26 kilometers) from Greenland; thus, a little-known geographical fact is that Canada is about as close to Denmark as is New York City to suburban Connecticut!) So, contrary to the plot of \\"Deception Point,\\" it's unlikely that exploration of Ellesmere Island could proceed undetected and a priceless physical object removed from it without objection.<br />Notwithstanding the foregoing comments, I do recommend \\"Deception Point.\\" It's grippingly written.known geographical fact is that Canada is about as close to Denmark as is New York City to suburban Connecticut!)

US	52474128	R1WS1R4I473WNC	0151004145	289512427	The Cave	Books	3	29	44	N	N	OK, but not Saramago's best	I had the honor of meeting Jos&eacute; Saramago at a book-signing in Lisbon's Chiado district shortly after he won the Nobel Prize in 1998. At the time, I wondered if receiving the prize would cause one of my favorite novelists to sit back and write nothing worthy of note, or nothing at all.<br />Fortunately, \\"The Cave\\" bears the earmarks of earnestness, diligence, and love of the Portuguese language that characterize Saramago's earlier works. But as a novel it's disappointing.<br />The central theme of \\"The Cave\\" is that a giant, impersonal, and arrogantly managed shopping center, the octopean Centro, is extending its tentacles and squeezing the commercial life out of the region. The main character, Cipriano Algor, an artisan potter living in a rural hamlet and eking out a living selling dishes to the Centro, is one of the shopping complex's victims. The Centro treats its suppliers ruthlessly: work with us on one-sided terms or we'll dispense with you. And we'll dispense with you anyway when you're no longer useful to us. Disastrous for Algor, the Centro no longer wants to sell his stoneware; its customers prefer cheaper and less breakable plastic tableware.<br />Thus, much of the novel consists of the petty indignities the nasty Centro visits on the desperate and humiliated Algor, a situation complicated by the fact that Mar√ßal Gacho, Algor's live-in son-in-law, is a security guard for the shopping center and wants to move there with his wife Marta. (The Centro contains an apartment complex.)<br />For all these facts, the plot is thin, and it's stifled by overlong narratives, asides, and commentaries that dominate the novel. \\"The Cave\\" is like an opera with much singing and little action. Indeed, few dramatic events disturb the novel's languor until the final 35 or so pages of the 350-page-long Portuguese version. And there's little that's compelling about Cipriano Algor, Mar√ßal Gacho, Marta, or the family dog, Achado (Found). They're all without depth. Algor is a stiff, diffident and lonely widower whose inability to act on his interest in Isaura, the widow across town, exasperates the reader. Oddly, Saramago relies heavily on the family dog for character development, extolling Achado's virtues. But this peculiar device does not succeed. In the end, Achado's ordinary canine behavior fails to inspire interest in itself or to illuminate its owners' personalities.<br />And incongruously for such uneducated people, the characters often speak the King's Portuguese. (As alluded to, I read the book in Portuguese and that criticism may not apply to Margaret Jull Costa's English translation.)<br />\\"The Cave\\" contains a number of trite and cranky commentaries. They stand in unfortunate contrast to the acute sketches of human behavior and universal dilemmas that enliven other Saramago novels. Algor, his family, and his dog are portrayed as the salt of the earth, rather like the Joads in John Steinbeck's \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\" The conflict between Algor and the arrogant Centro is an allegory for Saramago's dislike of globalization and the liberalization of the world economy--a dislike he made clear in 1998, when he argued, \\"Injustices multiply, inequalities become worse, ignorance grows, misery spreads. The same schizophrenic humanity able to send instruments to [Mars] to study the composition of its rocks witnesses indifferently the deaths of millions from hunger. . . . Governments fail to do [their duty], because they don't know how to, because they can't, or because they don't want to. Or because those who effectively govern the world don't let them: the multinational and intercontinental corporations whose power, absolutely undemocratic, has reduced almost to nothing what once remained of the ideal of democracy.\\"<br />In sum, Saramago stands with the antiglobalization protestors who generated datelines from Seattle, Quebec City, and Genoa. His worldview may stem from the degrading poverty and oppression his grandparents experienced in rural Portugal (see his Nobel Prize acceptance speech). Yet if Saramago were less rigid, \\"The Cave\\" might acknowledge that the same liberalization that created the Centro permits Algor to leave behind its nouveau-riche customers and haughty management. He could sell instead to visitors to Portugal who want to buy handmade stoneware, or over the Internet to collectors in Montreal, Adelaide, and Sapporo.<br />Algor, then, is simply trying to sell in the wrong place, and if the Centro rebuffs him it points more to flaws in the Centro's marketing strategy than to the intrinsic cruelty \\"The Cave\\" suggests. Why should the Centro waste shelf space on relatively unprofitable merchandise?<br />Moreover, Saramago's portrayal of the Centro is unrealistic and shows a lack of awareness of the impermanence of economic hegemony. Even well-run companies face reversals. In today's financial news (November 8, 2002), McDonald's is reported to be withdrawing from three countries entirely and closing about 175 restaurants in 10 more. Saramago presents the Centro as omnipotent and timeless. But its bad relations with its suppliers would probably doom it in reality.<br />It's worth noting that Portugal, like Ireland, has been a European economic success story. Accompanying its economic growth, new shopping centers like Lisbon's Amoreiras and Columbo malls have emerged. They have been very popular, and have coincided with a decline in some traditional business districts.

Yet if Saramago were less rigid, \\"The Cave\\" might acknowledge that the same liberalization that created the Centro permits Algor to leave behind its nouveau-riche customers and haughty management. He could sell instead to visitors to Portugal who want to buy handmade stoneware, or over the Internet to collectors in Montreal, Adelaide, and Sapporo.<br />Algor, then, is simply trying to sell in the wrong place, and if the Centro rebuffs him it points more to flaws in the Centro's marketing strategy than to the intrinsic cruelty \\"The Cave\\" suggests. Why should the Centro waste shelf space on relatively unprofitable merchandise?<br />Moreover, Saramago's portrayal of the Centro is unrealistic and shows a lack of awareness of the impermanence of economic hegemony. Even well-run companies face reversals. In today's financial news (November 8, 2002), McDonald's is reported to be withdrawing from three countries entirely and closing about 175 restaurants in 10 more. Saramago presents the Centro as omnipotent and timeless. But its bad relations with its suppliers would probably doom it in reality.<br />It's worth noting that Portugal, like Ireland, has been a European economic success story. Accompanying its economic growth, new shopping centers like Lisbon's Amoreiras and Columbo malls have emerged.

But even if I had the time, I could not have assembled as well-executed a thriller as \\"A Small Death in Lisbon.\\"<br />Several things stand out in Robert Wilson's novel of crime and suspense. One is the richness of the contrasting portrayals of warring Germany, opportunistic Lisbon, and impoverished, backward rural Portugal during World War II, all of them ably juxtaposed in turn against the technocratic, Europe-oriented Lisbon of 1998. I was in the Portuguese capital in 1997 and 1998, and Wilson's portrayal of it rings true.<br />Another is the quality of the writing. Wilson has a vast vocabulary and uses language expertly, but he's able to fend off any risk of pretentiousness with the robust, Raymond-Chandleresque imagery and sardonic turns of phrase that mark many good mystery novels. Like Philip Marlowe visiting General Sternwood's mansion in \\"The Big Sleep,\\" Inspector Jos&eacute; Afonso (Z&eacute;) Coelho goes to the manor of a prominent Lisbon lawyer and observes: \\"The art on the walls was the sort that demanded comment unless you happened to be a police inspector from Lisbon in which case your opinion didn't matter.\\" (P. 74.) Wilson marks a pregnant pause during an interview in that house this way: \\"The ormolu clock nearly missed a tick.\\" (P. 66.) My favorite line in the whole book appears earlier: \\"An SS mess waiter in a white monkey jacket and black trousers put a tea tray down in front of the civilian, who didn't look up from the newspaper he wasn't reading.\\" (P. 20.) Brilliant.<br />Better yet, Wilson generally reserves his Chandleresque tone for modern Lisbon, deftly switching to a suitably more serious tone in the novel's anterior plot as he depicts various horrors in Nazi Germany and in Portugal under the oppressive regime of Ant&oacute;nio de Oliveira Salazar.<br />There is a noteworthy typographical error on page 237 of the American paperback edition. The date should be April 15, 1955, not 1995. If you think it's 1995 you'll become confused, wondering if Wilson has suddenly embarked on a parallel history in which General&iacute;simo Francisco Franco and the aforementioned Salazar continue to rule Spain and Portugal as right-wing centenarians, and in which Mozambique apparently does not become independent and its capital, Louren√ßo Marques, is not renamed Maputo in 1976.<br />\\"A Small Death in Lisbon\\" is carefully researched and Wilson had its Portuguese phraseology checked. Unfortunately (perhaps because of typesetting errors), in the American paperback edition some words are missing diacritical marks that should have them, others are adorned with them that shouldn't, and still others are misspelled. Thus, instances of what should be Direc√ß√£o, simp&aacute;tico, Volunt&aacute;rios, and Not&iacute;cias appear as Direc√ß√µ, simpatico, Voluntarios, and Not&iacute;√ßias.  That's a minor flaw in the production of a novel that is substantively excellent in all respects.d be April 15, 1955, not 1995.

Left-wing carping that the Net has been coopted for commercial purposes is wrong.  It misses the point that the Internet is the greatest research tool ever devised, and not just for commercial ends.<br />On page 46, the author of \\"The Mother Tongue\\" writes that Frisian, a close linguistic relative of English and Dutch, \\"has been so little altered by time that many [Frisians] can, according to [a] linguistic historian . . . , still read the medieval epic _Beowulf_ `almost at sight.' \\"<br />Knowing that old English, in which _Beowulf_ was written, is essentially foreign to modern English, I was skeptical that it could be that accessible to modern Frisian speakers.  So I checked the Internet.  Here, according to Catherine N. Ball of the Georgetown University linguistics department, is the Lord's Prayer in three versions:  old English, apparently modern Frisian, and the 1611 King James version.  (It seems that in old English the characters √∞ and √æ were pronounced similarly to modern \\"th,\\" both as in \\"thin\\" and in \\"that,\\" and the digraph √¶ was pronounced like \\"a\\" as in \\"hat.\\"  I hope your computer shows these characters.)<br />[Old English]<br />F√¶der ure √æu √æe eart on heofonum;<br />Si √æin nama gehalgod<br />to becume √æin rice<br />gewur√æe √∞in willa<br />on eor√∞an swa swa on heofonum.<br />urne ged√¶ghwamlican hlaf syle us tod√¶g<br />and forgyf us ure gyltas<br />swa swa we forgyfa√∞ urum gyltendum<br />and ne gel√¶d √æu us on costnunge<br />ac alys us of yfele so√ælice.<br />[Frisian]<br />Us Heit yn 'e himel,<br />lit jo namme hillige wurde,<br />lit jo keninkryk komme,<br />Lit jo wil dien wurde<br />op ierde likegoed as yn 'e himel.<br />Jou &uacute;s hjoed &uacute;s deistich brea<br />en ferjou &uacute;s &uacute;s skulden<br />sa't wy &uacute;s skuldners ek ferj√ªn hawwe;<br />en lit &uacute;s net yn fersiking komme,<br />mar ferlos &uacute;s fan 'e kweade;<br />[want jowes is it keninkryk<br />en de kr√™ft<br />en de hearlikheid<br />oant yn ivichheid.

About two-thirds of the way through \\"The Elementary Particles\\" the author describes in revolting detail a so-called snuff film involving the torture of a grandmother and her granddaughter.  Duly (i.e., as the author must have intended) disgusted by the content but unimpressed by such an obvious and needless attempt to shock, I thought \\"enough\\" and skipped ahead to the epilogue, which amounted to unconvincing science fiction.<br />Yet Michel Houellebecq writes well.  The manner in which he interweaves aspects of modern cultural and scientific history with the (respectively) tormented and tedious lives of the two misfits who are his main characters, Bruno and Michel, is interesting.  Moreover, the plot is not entirely nihilistic and cynical--at least one individual is capable of affection.<br />Still, I suspect that like the movie \\"Last Tango in Paris,\\" which was also a trendy exploration of sexual perversity, \\"The Elementary Particles\\" is doomed to become quickly dated.  Although \\"Last Tango in Paris\\" is inane through and through, it caused a sensation in certain quarters of the intelligentsia on its release in 1972.  And it probably did so in part because of some people's perceptions that it ventured toward new sexual frontiers.  Alas, how quickly times changed, and how quickly \\"Last Tango\\" became quaint and its pretentiousness evident, like a sea anemone exposed to low tide.  A similar fate may await \\"The Elementary Particles.\\"<br />The dry pages of the appellate legal reports routinely yield details of sexual crimes whose cruelty and depravity beggar the imagination.  By contrast, Houellebecq's wallowings in sexual perversity, though sometimes grotesque, come across as contrived and not particularly vivid.  Still, because \\"The Elementary Particles\\" is well written, I give it three stars.<br />(These comments apply to the French text.

US	52474128	R2TZA5T37641FU	0465016146	406165084	The Mystery Of Capital Why Capitalism Succeeds In The West And Fails Everywhere Else	Books	5	8	8	N	N	A Landmark in Modern Economic Thought	Hernando de Soto's \\"The Mystery of Capital\\" contains some of the freshest economic and legal thinking I've encountered.  Almost every page yields extraordinary insights, and if the arguments are repeated at times, I did not much mind.<br />Among the key contributions of \\"The Mystery of Capital\\" is a convincing explanation that the arguments for and against globalization that led to street battles in Seattle, Quebec, and Genoa miss the point.  All things being equal, freer (or better-managed) trade is good.  But overenthusiastic boosters of liberalized trade fail to understand that only a minority in developing countries, those with regularized, legal businesses and access to capital, are able to reap its benefits.  The extralegal majority know \\"they still linger at the periphery of the capitalist game.\\"  (P. 207.)  Resentment among them arises from their lack of access to capital, but it expresses itself, unfortunately but understandably, in opposition to freer trade.  (I should add that globalization opponents miss the point altogether, and their denunciations of liberalized trade tend to confirm that there are many economic ideas that the left cannot even fathom, much less debate usefully.)  For its comments on trade liberalization alone, \\"The Mystery of Capital\\" is a tour de force.<br />On finishing the book, I was wondering (and hoping) that de Soto's thinking might have an impact on development economics.  I did not have to wait long to find out.  That very evening (January 1, 2002), Bolivian President Jorge Fernando Quiroga Ram&iacute;rez was interviewed on the American television program The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer.  Quiroga, a 41-year-old graduate of Texas A&amp;M University, said that he was instituting a program of land titling so that Bolivians (presumably including the poor) will be able to use their property as security for loans and generally as financial vehicles, thereby allowing them to generate capital.  \\"You know, market economics sometimes hasn't reached everybody. Because if you have a piece of land that you have no title to, how can you be for market economics when you can't get more goods, when you can't use it as collateral and things like land titling, access to housing which is the basic building block of market economy, you can't quite relate to it,\\" Quiroga told his interviewer.  He said that as a result of the reforms that have been instituted, Bolivians can now get a 20-year loan on their property at less than 10 percent interest.  That is a remarkable achievement, unheard of in that country, and a testament to the influence of de Soto's work.  With leaders like Quiroga and Vicente Fox in Mexico, I am optimistic about the future of at least some developing countries.<br />It was hard to find anything to refute in \\"The Mystery of Capital.\\"  For example, and in tandem with the arguments advanced in the book, it is evident that national cultural attributes, though a factor in advancing or retarding economic development, cannot account for the great differences in prosperity among nations.  Brazilians, for example, tend to be hard-working people, contrary to any stereotype of sleepy Latin America.  I remember going to the airport at Bel&eacute;m, the equatorial port at the mouth of the Amazon, about 5:00 a.m. one day in 1984.  At that early hour, well before dawn, the city buses were filled with people going to work.<br />Another point with which I agree:  de Soto draws an important distinction between ramshackle and seemly chaotic extralegal housing in developing countries and the developed world's pockets of urban decay.  He argues that the former tend to improve, unlike the latter.  That appears to be true.  Housing in Brazilian favelas (extralegal squatter developments) is said to be rising in value.  In one favela, Parais&oacute;polis, \\"A two-room wooden shack at the end of a cramped alley can cost around $1,400 while a two-bedroom house facing a main road can sell for as much as $16,000.  Thatis more than most state-run public housing and on par with apartments in outlying lower income neighborhoods.\\"  (Jennifer L. Rich, \\"Brazilian Slums Prove Location Reigns Supreme In Real Estate,\\" The New York Times, Dec. 2, 2001.)  I predict that today's hillside favela will be tomorrow's picturesque Alfama (Lisbon's old Arab quarter).<br />\\"The Mystery of Capital\\" ranges far beyond development economics:  it also offers an explanation of why developed countries are wealthy.  It ought to be required reading in college and graduate-level economics programs.  I do not mean to suggest that it contains answers to all national economic problems, for countries can suffer from them even when their citizens have financially useful access to their own capital.  For example, I am not sure how relevant \\"The Mystery of Capital\\" is to Argentina's difficulties.  Still, this must be one of the most important works in both economics and law in many years.state-run public housing and on par with apartments in outlying lower income neighborhoods.\\"  (Jennifer L.

(Recall that in The Manchurian Candidate the mantra was &quot;Raymond Shaw is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I've ever known in my life&quot;; here it's &quot;Two clients are normal. Two clients are fine.&quot;)<br />There's no need to rehearse the plot here, but from the first page, seemingly disconnected and disparate sequences of ghastly or eerie events or conditions grip the reader. The novel's menacing psychological overtones foreshadow events effectively, and the characters are plausible and engaging.<br />Moreover, &quot;John Case&quot; leavens the plot with dashes of humor, among them a funny rendering of the dreary world of one of the main characters, a law firm associate forced to overlawyer a minor commercial dispute at the expense of her own life to please an unpleasant firm partner, a regular Colonel Blimp.<br />The first novel by &quot;John Case,&quot; The Genesis Code, was also excellent, whereas The First Horseman, though okay, was disappointing by comparison. The Syndrome is equal to The Genesis Code and perhaps better. The characters are lively enough that there's no need for them to be young and good-looking -- when the plot is sufficient, such characteristics and the obligatory sex scene become unnecessary. The novel would have been just as good if the main characters were middle-aged and had weight problems.<br />One thing the novel needed was better copy-editing. What was the Institute of Global Studies throughout becomes the Institute of Global Affairs (p. 371 of the hardcover version). Apartment 6-F of the Capitol Towers (pp. 195, 196) becomes Apartment 6-G (p. 409). Chaise longue is &quot;chaise lounge&quot; (p. 18), though maybe that metathesis is now standard English; and there are some mistakes in French (p. 383). If &quot;John Case&quot; writes another novel, I hereby volunteer to look over a draft to try to catch such mistakes. If it's as good as The Syndrome, I'll welcome the chance to read it in advance.&quot;John Case&quot; writes another novel, I hereby volunteer to look over a draft to try to catch such mistakes.

US	52474128	R1QTJTS9TX2F9H	8420442283	698330799	La Caverna (Jose Saramago Works) (Spanish Edition)	Books	3	4	7	N	N	Not Saramago's Best	I had the honor of meeting Jos&eacute; Saramago at a book-signing in Lisbon's Chiado district shortly after he won the Nobel Prize in 1998. At the time, I wondered if receiving the prize would cause my favorite novelist to sit back and write nothing worthy of note, or nothing at all.<br />Fortunately, \\"The Cavern\\" bears the earmarks of earnestness, diligence, and love of the Portuguese language that characterize Saramago's earlier works. But as a novel it's disappointing. The characters are ordinary and there's not much of a plot.<br />The central theme of \\"The Cavern\\" is that a giant, impersonal, and arrogantly managed shopping center, the Centro, is spreading like an oil slick and sucking the commercial life out of the region. The main character, Cipriano Algor, an artisan potter living in a rural hamlet and eking out a living selling dishes to the Centro, is one of the shopping complex's victims. The Centro treats its suppliers ruthlessly: work with us according to the one-sided terms we impose or we'll dispense with you; and we'll dispense with you anyway when you're no longer useful to us. And the Centro no longer wants to sell Algor's stoneware; its customers prefer plastic tableware that's cheaper and less breakable.<br />Thus, much of the novel consists of the petty indignities the Centro visits on the desperate and humiliated Algor, a situation complicated by the fact that Mar√ßal Gacho, Algor's live-in son-in-law, is a security guard for the Centro and wants to move there with his wife Marta.<br />There's a plot there, but it's thin, and it's stifled by overlong narratives, asides, and commentaries that dominate the novel. \\"The Cavern\\" is like an opera with much singing and little action. Indeed, few events disturb the novel's languor until the final 35 or so pages of the 350-page-long Portuguese version. And there's little that's compelling about Cipriano Algor, Mar√ßal Gacho, Marta, or the family dog, Achado. They're all nice and all without depth. (And incongruously for such uneducated folk, they often speak the king's Portuguese.) Algor is a stiff, diffident and lonely widower whose inability to act on his interest in Isaura, the widow across town, exasperates the reader. Saramago relies heavily on the family dog for character development (a danger sign), extolling Achado's virtues. But in the end, Achado's ordinary canine behavior fails to inspire interest in itself or to illuminate its owners' personalities.<br />Moreover, some of Saramago's commentaries are trite and cranky; they lack the acuity of the sketches of human behavior and travails that enliven other Saramago novels. Algor, his family, and his dog are portrayed as the salt of the earth, rather like the Joads in John Steinbeck's \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\" The conflict between Algor and the arrogant Centro is an allegory for Saramago's dislike of globalization and the liberalization of the world economy--a dislike he made clear in 1998, when he argued, \\"Injustices multiply, inequalities become worse, ignorance grows, misery spreads. The same schizophrenic humanity able to send instruments to [Mars] to study the composition of its rocks witnesses indifferently the deaths of millions from hunger. . . . Governments fail to do [their duty], because they don't know how to, because they can't, or because they don't want to. Or because those who effectively govern the world don't let them: the multinational and intercontinental corporations whose power, absolutely undemocratic, has reduced almost to nothing what once remained of the ideal of democracy.\\"<br />In sum, Saramago stands with the protestors of Seattle, Quebec City, and Genoa. His worldview may stem from the degrading poverty and oppression his grandparents experienced in rural Portugal (see his Nobel Prize acceptance speech). Yet if \\"The Cavern\\" were less rigid, it would acknowledge that the same liberalization that creates the Centro should permit Algor (with the help of a government economic-development agency) to leave behind the Centro's nouveau-riche customers and haughty management for the armies of foreign tourists who want to buy handmade Portuguese stoneware, or to sell his goods over the Internet to collectors in Montreal, Adelaide, and Sapporo. Algor is simply trying to sell in the wrong place, and it's not the Centro's fault if it rebuffs him, though it may point to flaws in the Centro's marketing strategy. (On the last point: Saramago's portrayal of the Centro is unrealistic. He presents it as omnipotent and destined to be unbound by time. But the Centro's rigidity and pomposity would appear to consign it to the impermanence of Percy Bysshe Shelley's Ozymandias, fated to become \\"the decay / Of that colossal wreck . . .\\" \\"[h]alf sunk\\" amid \\"[t]he lone and level sands . . . .\\"<br />It's worth noting that Portugal, like Ireland, has been a European economic success story. According to a Portuguese government report, \\"Between 1986 and 2000 the Portuguese economy grew by 3.6% per annum, compared with 2.5% for the EU [European Union]. . . . Real GDP growth averaged 5.0% per annum in 1986-90, compared with 3.3% for the EU as a whole, and was the highest in the EU and second highest in the OECD during that period. Growth slowed to 1.7% during 1991-95 in response to a deteriorating European business cycle, but still exceeded the EU average of 1.5%. Portugal pulled ahead in subsequent years, and growth of 3.4% in 1996-2000 was above the EU average of 2.6%.\\" Accompanying that growth, new shopping centers like Lisbon's Amoreiras and Columbo malls have emerged. They have been very popular, and have coincided with a decline in some traditional business districts. Yet Portugal hardly seems economically, socially or culturally the worse for these changes, Saramago's lament notwithstanding. The country was markedly better off in those respects in 1998 than it was when I first visited it in 1992.<br />My recommendation: if you're a Saramago fan, you may enjoy \\"The Cavern.\\" But if you're new to him, start by reading one of his better novels, like \\"The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis,\\" \\"Blindness,\\" or \\"All the Names.\\"gency) to leave behind the Centro's nouveau-riche customers and haughty management for the armies of foreign tourists who want to buy handmade Portuguese stoneware, or to sell his goods over the Internet to collectors in Montreal, Adelaide, and Sapporo.

I'll summarize them only generally so as not to give away the plots.<br />In the first, it appears that a killer disaffected by modern society is toppling various pillars of the community by mailing envelopes filled with poisonous yellow powder to them. A police officer on the investigating force (apparently in Los Angeles) uncovers a secret so potent, revealing that things aren't at all what they seem, that he decides he has to flee to Latin America, sneaking south across the border as his parents had done in the opposite direction decades before, to tell his story. In the meantime, we're treated to elaborate digressions within the narrative -- for example, the supposed killer's brother tries to trick him into confessing by inventing a fabulous story about a hunt for the treasure of the Albigensians (a heretical sect that influenced Languedoc, France, in the thirteenth century (see Joan Acocella, &quot;Good and Evil,&quot; The New Yorker, August 6, 2001, pp. 82-85)) underneath a modern French supermarket.<br />In the second, a character, Ana C., who's an old friend and would-be lover of the police officer in the first part (and appears in that part to be female), turns out to be a male who stars in gay pornographic movies and has a following of groupies who are confined to an insane asylum. The police purportedly suspect Ana C. of being involved in the murder of a prominent politician, but they can't find him, whereas the narrator, a still photographer hired by a scandal sheet to infiltrate the pornography industry and make contact with Ana C., is able to do so and hears out his story.<br />The book is wonderfully written, with an impeccable style and a dizzying lack of resolution -- it's susceptible of multiple interpretations, like the movie &quot;Memento.&quot; The final sentence in the novel does suggest an outcome. I'd probably have to read it four times to understand it as much as I'd like. As for now, having read it just once, I highly recommend it. Anyone who likes Flannery O'Connor would probably enjoy &quot;Teatro.&quot; Unfortunately, I don't know if it's been translated from Portuguese into English. If not, it should be. In the meantime, if you're teaching, or taking, a course in modern Brazilian literature, &quot;Teatro&quot; would be an excellent addition to the reading list.

Zimler's portrait of Lisbon in 1506, with Jews being killed  by the Christian majority, is vividly drawn.

Top Vatican bureaucrats drop everything and rush to  investigate.  Yeah, right.<br />Father Quart, for his part, is cold,  calculating, and distant.  It seems that the author himself dislikes him.  The other characters are a clutch of clich&eacute;s:  the rough-edged but devout  local parish priest, the scheming businessman, the oily low-life enforcer,  etc.  None is interesting, let alone memorable.<br />Much of the novel dwells  on Father Quart's lust for a beautiful Seville high-society woman,  Macarena.  The big question:  will Quart break his vows and hop into bed  with her?<br />Mind you, there's nothing interesting about either Quart or his  love interest.  Nor is there any subtlety about their connection, which is  purely hormonal:  Quart is handsome and suave, and Macarena, one is  instructed, is a babe.  &quot;In the candlelight, her skin was dark in  contrast to her ivory necklace and silk shirt.  Her large dark eyes looked  back into his.  He realized then that his soul was in peril.  Had it been a  share on the stock market, its value would have plunged.&quot;  (Pages  157-158.)  Oh, dear!  Quart suffers even more when she &quot;lean[s]  forward on her elbows, and her silk blouse [that blouse again!] brushe[s]  the edge of the table.  Quart could sense what was inside:  heavy, brown,  soft.  He needed more than a cold shower.&quot;  (Pages 158-159.)<br />I'm not  inventing the foregoing quotations!  If you can make your way to the end of  &quot;The Seville Communion,&quot; you will find out whether these two  cardboard people connect sexually.  But you won't care.

She made me realize that the current dispute in this country over access to firearms has a long  pedigree.  Her depiction of the circumstances under which England, in 1689,  declared the right to bear arms &quot;true, ancient, and indubitable,&quot;  when in fact it was none of those is particularly interesting.  (See p.  115.)  She provides evidence for her view that &quot;it is particularly  ironic that some modern American lawyers have misread the English right to  have arms as merely a 'collective' right inextricably tied to the need for  a militia&quot; (p. 119) when by 1689 the opposite was true.  I'm not a  historian or a gun enthusiast, but I find all of this quite  fascinating.<br />When the book turns to the Second Amendment to the United  States Constitution, however, its energy seems to flag.  I am sympathetic  to the argument that the Second Amendment confers a right on &quot;the  people&quot; respectively, i.e. as individuals, &quot;to keep and bear  Arms.&quot;  But Malcolm's argument is undermined, however slightly, when  she urges that &quot;[s]ome&quot; i.e., more than one, nascent American  state constitutions &quot;included a specific right for an individual to  have firearms for his own defence&quot; (p. 150), but quotes and cites, as  best I can discern, only the Pennsylvania bill of rights in support (pp.  148, 149).  Is there more than one, or not?  Another apparent example of  waning energy toward the end is the treatment of an argument that  &quot;like the Convention Parliament in 1689, the senators [debating drafts  of the Second Amendment] rejected a motion to add 'for the common defense'  after 'to keep and bear arms.' &quot;  (P. 161.)  To me, that point seems  crucial, but Malcolm does not explore it further, beyond providing a  footnoted reference to another source.<br />Finally, some minor quibbles.  Noting the author's regular use of English spelling, I thought she was  English until I realized, on reading the penultimate page, that she is an  American (p. 176).  Perhaps Malcolm was reared and educated in England, but  nevertheless her anglicizations are distracting and seem affected.  It also  seems affected to spell &quot;dissension&quot; archaically as  &quot;dissention&quot; (p. 153), and to print &quot;u&quot; as  &quot;v&quot; in quoted material, as in &quot;Vs&quot; (Us) (p. 41) or  &quot;vpon&quot; (upon) (p. 59).  If one is going to do that, why not also  ask the typesetter to print quotations with the long &quot;s&quot; that  looks similar to the lower-case &quot;f&quot;?  (Actually, I wouldn't so  much object to that, though it would also come across as affected:  at  least the long &quot;s&quot; is still an &quot;s,&quot; though of archaic  form, whereas a &quot;v&quot; is not a &quot;u&quot; at all.)  These are,  of course, trivial items, but when I encounter them, I think, &quot;Come  on, Harvard University Press copy-editors, get with it!&quot;<br />After all  the foregoing griping, it may appear that (1) I am a detail-obsessed  curmudgeon of uncommon degree, and (2) I disliked the book.  The first  point may be true, but the second is not.  I look forward to seeing how  others eventually build on Malcolm's scholarship.thor's regular use of English spelling, I thought she was  English until I realized, on reading the penultimate page, that she is an  American (p. 176).

The plot moves slowly, and at  times events intended to be realistic do not come across that way.  Of  course, compared to most literature, &quot;The Stone Raft&quot; is  excellent, but compared to certain other novels of Saramago, I would give  it a middling rating.<br />Incidentally, I can tell those Saramago fans who  are awaiting the translation of his recent novel &quot;Todos os Nomes&quot;  (&quot;All the Names&quot;) that it's excellent, and it should be a  pleasure to read in English.	1999-10-24

Almost by definition, words are inadequate, because they cannot do justice  to the richness of the language, the plot, or the ideas of their  object.<br />That's the problem I face in trying to praise &quot;The Year of  the Death of Ricardo Reis.&quot; Anything I say will sound inadequate. In  fact, for a reason analogous to that which lies behind the joke about  selling at a loss but making up for it in volume, the more I say the more  inadequate my effort is going to be.<br />So just a few words. I think  &quot;Ricardo Reis&quot; is one of the great twentieth-century novels, a  work that, by itself, justifies Saramago's Nobel Prize for Literature.  Reis's obsessional behavior, his philosophical conversations with Fernando  Pessoa, the evocation of a rainswept Lisbon just before World War II, the  venality of petty martinets--all of these are presented with an awareness  of universal truths and of human beings' complexity that reverberates  deeply. It will enrich the life of anyone who reads it.<br />I do have a  couple of suggestions for anyone who buys &quot;Ricardo Reis.&quot; Look in  an encyclopedia to see who Fernando Pessoa and Ricardo Reis were. It will  help to understand the plot. And don't be put off by the way Saramago  separates dialogue, with commas and a capital letter rather than quotation  marks. It's not always easy to follow, but its effect, intended or not, is  to give the dialogues a dreamlike quality that's part of the novel's  appeal.<br />Also, if, after reading &quot;Ricardo Reis,&quot; you visit  Lisbon and feel the urge to visit the Hotel Bragan√ßa or the small public  square with Adamastor's statue, you can. The Hotel Bragan√ßa is located on  the south side of the Rua do Alecrim about 100-200 feet (30-60 meters) from  the foot of the street. The square is not far from there, and you should be  able to find it on a good city map. To see the hotel without the trip, use  a search engine to locate &quot;lusophone links&quot; and you may find my  website, which has photos of the hotel and of Saramago.<br />Incidentally, for  those Saramago fans who await the translation of his recent novel  &quot;Todos os Nomes&quot; (&quot;All the Names&quot;), I've already read  it in Portuguese and it's excellent.e  a search engine to locate &quot;lusophone links&quot; and you may find my  website, which has photos of the hotel and of Saramago.<br />Incidentally, for  those Saramago fans who await the translation of his recent novel  &quot;Todos os Nomes&quot; (&quot;All the Names&quot;), I've already read  it in Portuguese and it's excellent.	1999-10-23

I guess several things made it irritating for me.<br />First, the Andrea Gail's crewmen aren't well developed as people--they come across as cardboard or  stick figures, which is unfair to them.  Same with events.  No one knows  what happened to the ship, and the book ends up being a sand castle of  sensational speculation, much of it unnecessary and some of it, I thought,  rather tasteless (especially the gratuitous description of the process of  drowning).<br />Second, the writing is laden with superlatives, and after a  while, you just get tired of reading how everything is the greatest, the  worst, the most powerful, the most sickening, the most awful, etc.  As a  result, I ended up feeling fatigued, and skimmed the last part of the book.  At times it seemed that Junger wanted to give every sentence the  rhetorical equivalent of an exclamation mark.<br />I kept comparing &quot;The  Perfect Storm&quot; to Farley Mowat's &quot;Grey Seas Under,&quot; a book I  read 15 or 20 years ago.  I don't remember its content well, except that it  also described rescues of seafarers off Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, but I  do recall that Mowat's writing was more understated, and perhaps for that  reason far more engaging, than that of &quot;The Perfect  Storm.&quot;<br />Third, a book like this suffers from the lack of careful  copy-editing.  This probably isn't Junger's fault:  it's the publisher's.  The hardback edition has numerous typos or other glitches:  St. John's,  Nfld., is sometimes misspelled St. Johns (pp. 93, 94), &quot;sunk&quot; is  given as the past tense of &quot;sink&quot; (p. 26), and the modern  Portuguese word for cod, bacalhau, comes out baccalao (p. 24).  There are  other goofs, but no point in listing them all here--it would come across as  pedantic.  It just seems to me that publishers more and more are abandoning  their responsibility to edit copy carefully.	1999-08-21

Purple prose:  &quot;And her body took him to realms he had never  before discovered.&quot;  (P. 127.)  &quot;She danced with the fury of  a caged panther, and when the music demanded that she 'walk this way,' her  responding strut fired a bolt of hormonal lightning through his loins.  Watching her remove the leather brassiere that supported her generous  breasts, his mouth turned dry as the Gobi.&quot;  (P. 321.)  2.  Needless rhetorical questions:  &quot;No one had pushed him into the  path of the tram.  Then why could he still feel the imprint of another  person's palm scalding his lower back?&quot;  (P. 3.)  &quot;They  regarded themselves as the chosen ones, and in fact, they were.  Financial  centurions for the new millennium. [¬∂] Why then did he hate them so?&quot;  (P. 49.)  3.  Clich&eacute;ed or clumsy writing:  &quot;The morning fog,  which during winter loitered on the Swiss plateau like an unwelcome  houseguest, had at 11:45 a.m. Friday not yet lifted.&quot;  (P. 163.)  &quot;And then he knew.  Power.  Vision.  Scope.&quot;  (P. 263.)  &quot;She looked into the mirror a long time.  Trust.  Dedication.  Effort.&quot;  (P. 276.)  &quot;[I]t was not long before his mind  wandered back to the dilemma that pressed on his heart like a sharpened  dagger.&quot;  (Pp. 222-23.)  Still, if you can overlook these examples  and other bad writing, a rather predictable plot, and the stock characters,  the novel is entertaining enough.  And it contains one quite funny scene,  in which a villain desperate to obtain a Swiss passport from a corrupt  official is nevertheless subjected to the indignity of a series of  officious questions.  If you need to put your mind on autopilot for a  14-hour flight from San Francisco to Sydney, &quot;Numbered Account,&quot;  at 753 easily read pages, will fill the bill.es, will fill the bill.	1999-08-01

I confess that I read only the first part of the book and thereafter skimmed through it. The reason: a book of this type, relying on statistics and facts, can't contain the number of errors I soon spotted and retain my interest. On page 20, the author writes, &quot;half of all Americans own more than one car, one-third purchase a second car, and one-fifth own yet a third.&quot; That doesn't quite compute. On page 32, she writes that 78,000 miles equal &quot;double [the journey] of astronaut Neil Armstrong . . . .&quot; Not as long as the moon's mean distance from Earth remains approximately 238,900 miles. Then there are the typos: &quot;in accessible&quot; (p. 3); &quot;Loma Pieta&quot; (p. 46). The Loma Prieta earthquake occurred in 1989, not 1993 as she states. Enough! I sympathize with the author's argument. As a cyclist and a car owner in the San Francisco Bay Area, I frequently use my bike because it's faster. But it's hard to read a book when errors begin to crop up almost from the first page. The photos, however, are wonderful.	1998-08-08
