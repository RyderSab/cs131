What's great about this book, aside from the reasons Todd Wilbur listed on why copy restaurant recipes, is the history of the restaurant featured. Such lore gives you an insight on how these successful chains were built and expanded.<br /><br />His recipes (for those I have tried) come close to the original  (or what I remember them to be). Being in another country makes it possible for me to satisfy my craving for some Stateside food, especially if that chain is not present here in Manila.<br /><br />Thank you, Mr. Todd Wilbur for this great service. Rest assured, I will buy your other books so I can get satisfy my jones for White Castle Slyders.	2004-11-03

Finally, Robert Kiyosaki gets around and communicate somewhat clearly and concretely, ways to attain financial success.  The writing here is still awkward and repetitive, but at least, there's Sharon Lechter to summarize his points in a clear and straightforward manner. You'll get around understanding what Kiyosaki says by the end of each chapter.    Questions on his credibility aside, this book is much more helpful than most of his previous books, which tend to be redundant and circuitious. It shows how you can accelerate your finances by using good debt, leveraging it to other assets so you can create income pipelines. Although some people say his methods are very risky (which being a sole income provider, I wholeheartedly agree), the book opened my mind on methods possible to attain wealth. I may temper Kiyosaki's approach but his book has truly made me aware of the possibilities of attaining a secure and prosperous tomorrow without waiting too long.     Now, if only he allows the editor to improve his writing...	2004-11-03

Known more for his revamp of Stormwatch and the creation of the Authority, Warren Ellis managed to create an exciting comic about non-superheroes. Consisting of 1001 agents of different skills and backgrounds, Miranda Zero has various tools at her disposal. The fun of the book is finding out what kind of agent Miranda will use to solve a particular emergency with effects that are global in scale. Each story is self-contained,  you can read it in short bursts. But it is so compelling, you'll be hard-pressed to do just that.	2004-10-19

The description of Drake's, the titular piano tuner, travels from London to Carroll's stronghold in inner Burma is very interesting. His pacing matches the slow journey from the docks of England and his sailing on the waters of the Mediterranean, his train ride through India and his arrival in Rangoon and the slow boat ride up the river to Mandalay up to his journey to where the Erard Piano is located. This section of the narrative takes up 3/4 of the book and nearing the end pages, it's as if nothing is happening. There are hints and inner musings of Drake on his views about Burma and his dilemma of leaving Burma and a femme fatale for home, but all these are done in a pretty vague way, you feel detached and unsympathetic to the character. When we get to the final twist, it is only mentioned in a few paragraphs thus, it gives a rather hurried ending.   <br /> <br />Read it if you're interested in colonial life in Asia, Burmese history and pianos, you'll learn a lot. But if you're looking for a compelling, satisfying if not mind-opening read you can do better by reading his inspirations.	2004-10-19

Books	3	2	2	N	N	Wherever there's Lobo, there's mayhem	Lobo gets unexpectedly fragged by one of the criminals he's hunting and his soul journeys from Heaven to Hell. As expected, ultra-violence follows. This book has absolutely no pretensions or philosophical musings on the impact of violence on society.  It's just good, sick, gory fun. There are some laugh out moments as you would expect from the Main Man. This book is rated mainly on sheer entertainment, no points for relevance or breaking new ground in literature (as if). The reason why it didn't get the perfect score (in Lobo standards) is the art. It may not be the fault of DC to have two artists in this book (Simon Bisley, the quintessential Lobo artist, failed to meet deadlines or some other reason and DC was forced to replace him midway in the series), it's just that Bisley's replacement artist, suffers in comparison to the man who defined the Lobo look. But if you could look past it, it's a nice read.	2004-05-28

Eversince I read the Crime Syndicate in Crisis and Who's Who, I was intrigued by the concept (I was a 10 year old back then), so when I saw JLA Earth 2 featuring updated versions of Ultra-Man (not the giant Japanese superhero), Superwoman, Owlman, Power Ring and Johnny Quick, I had to pick them up. They were the original ANTI-Justice League. Not the Squadron Supreme. Not The Authority.     Morrison, in reviving the world of the Crime Syndicate, sidestepped the idea of another Multiverse (which were destroyed in Crisis) by setting up the CSA Earth in the anti-matter universe, the same universe as Qward's (of Sinestro fame). Here, evil is good and vice versa. So you get the counterparts of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern and The Flash as the baddies while their Lex Luthor is the lone good guy (I wonder if this is the same Christopher Atkins-looking Alexander Luthor in Crisis), To make the story short, the JL members travel to the Anti-Earth to help the good Luthor against the CSA. The CSA , in turn, head to the JL Earth to retaliate against the meddling of Superman and company.     The story is engaging and Quitely's art is solid (really solid). The way the Crime Syndicate behaves is very reminiscent of today's The Authority.     My only question is, how come there are no counterparts for Martian Manhunter and Aquaman? If the creators couldn't come up with Anti-Earth counterparts, why bother including the two members? They weren't that crucial to the plot anyway.      The Crime Syndicate, precursor of those superteam-taking-over-the-government ideas, can be an excellent vehicle to tackle those \\"philosophical\\" superhero issues. Too bad, i a lot of books have had a head start (Squadron Supreme/Supreme Power and The Authority) and became such a fad nowadays (JSA Black Reign arc is a recent example). But on second thought,  maybe that's the reason why DC released this.	2004-05-28

The book has a number of laugh out loud moments, although sometimes I tend to get bogged down by the numerous exchanges of dialogue, sometimes it crowds out the art inside the panels.  The addition of Mary Marvel is perfect, it's a wonder why she wasn't there in the previous series. I'm actually looking forward to the next book (which I hope becomes a TPB soon) where Guy Gardner makes a return, rumored to be using his old yellow power ring.  <br />Although Giffen and DeMatteis JL is more about the characters, as stated by the previous reviewer, I would've loved to see them in a \\"serious\\" fight, meaning, facing them against a legit DC villain (No more Manga Khan please). Again, my bias for second stringers saving the day shows here. <br />Nevertheless, it's a fun book worth picking up.	2004-05-27

Andy Diggle and Jock deliver a pulse-racing arc that's worthy of a cinema treatment.  It may not be as ground breaking as Vertigo's other titles but it's sure is up there in terms of entertainment and thrills. Jock's art is perfect for this type of comic genre. Along with Stormwatch: Team Achilles, I recommend The Losers.	2004-05-24

This book is packed with wisdom and insights on how to succeed in any creative based business. It will inspire you and push you to heights you never knew you can reach However, the way it is written/presented makes it one of tthe greatest rip-offs of the year. It is basically a collection of one liners and phrases. Not that what's written are rubbish (it is very helpful) but some are obvious common sense. It is a very quick read, I managed to read the WHOLE book in a bookstore while standing. This where I balk at recommending this book for purchase.

You'll enjoy it you're a fan of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and Umberto Eco's works.  That is, if you haven't read Dan Brown's earlier Angels &amp; Demons. The problem with Da Vinci Code is it's almost a rewrite of the earlier novel, it's as if Brown has a template for Langdon's adventures. The plot devices are the same: Both have a mysterious assassin tasked by a faceless villain to carry out a mission based on a historical secret. And both books feature the revelation of the villain as the least person you'd suspect (although he doesn't do a good job of throwing readers off, you'll know pages before the revelation).  Another problem is Robert Langdon's involvement in the Da Vinci Code chase. It's so forced/contrived, you can have Da Vinci Code without Langdon!  Sophie Neveu is supposed to be a crack cryptologist and she could've solved the riddles without Langdon's help, sooner or later.<br />Again, I'll say it's an enjoyable book IF YOU HAVEN'T READ Angels &amp; Demons. If you have, it's like watching a rerun.	2004-03-03

Riddle of the Beast  is a pretty interesting Elseworlds story but it could've used an extra issue or two. While the use of DCU characters as classic fantasy archetypes are quite enjoyable and intriguing, the overall story seems to be underdeveloped. Though they used different artists whose work appear in Magic: The Gathering cards for that epic fantasy look, the whole graphic novel reads like an outline, far from the aforementioned epic fantasy feel this work aims to project. The build-up feels rushed and the characters introductions are done in a hurried fashion. It's as if there was a general feeling that the creators wanted to cram as many DCU characters as possible, sacrificing the overall pace of the book. Characters like Flash, Green Lantern and the Atom were just given cursory glances even if there was a lot of build-up to Robin and Zatanna's journey to the three men's City at the Center. Only a few panels and off to another setting. In fact, the main battle scene, after pages and pages of build-up and repetitive captions, amounted to just one page. Heck if only they devoted more space to it just like what they did to the world map which appeared three times or more! After reading this book, you could've wished that the bosses at DC could've followed the lead of the fantasy epics they aimed to ape by doing a trilogy at least.	2004-02-19

Just like what Warren Ellis did to Stormwatch and Alan Moore for Supreme, Kelly took on another one-note Rob Liefeld character ('Pool first appeared in the Liefeld drawn New Mutants #98) and turned it into one of the wackiest characters in comics. A  180 from his grim and gritty 90s-era origins, his one liners, the sight gags and quirky cast make Deadpool an endearing character. Ed McGuiness' cartoony art and clean lines suit the light tonality of this book. It's a fun ride with Marvel's Merc-With-A-Mouth.	2004-02-17

The story chronicles the establishment of the Asylum as the dumping ground for the criminally-insane. Morrison also asks, is Batman the source of all insanity in Gotham? It may be debatable but Bats keeps the cells filled and it's too coincidental that almost all of his adversaries are wackos. McKean's art truly captures the insanity that goes within the walls. Using various techniques, he conveys each inmate's personality with subtle shifts in art.  Truly excellent. Truly a must have.	2004-02-17

The story is straight out of a AD&amp;D module (he is after all, a self-confessed AD&amp;D fan), the characters are straight out a geek's wet dream. The art is, though cartoony, is detailed and flashy but it doesn't contribute much to storytelling (if there was any story to begin with) since Madureira has filled it with endless posturings and fights. Borrow it if you can, since it's quick, fun read but do not waste your money buying this. Besides, Madureira never got to put an issue on time, never got to conclude the story arc in this collection and was ultimately cancelled. I guess that's why it's under the imprint Cliffhanger.	2004-02-17

Meilville's words are very visual, I felt I was reading a graphic novel without illustrations. However, the pacing could've been faster, as Meilville tend to have overly-long descriptions of a character's philosophical state or the inner workings of a city's bureaucracy.

Lobo, feared intergalactic bounty hunter must bring in his school teacher to Vril Dox, along the way they meet all sorts of crazy characters.  In the end, we'll know why the book is titled the Last Czarnian. <br />Lobo was originally meant as a send-up/spoof to all those Marvel/Image grim and gritty characters like Cable, Wolverine and Punisher, but he the joke was lost to the fanboys back in the '90s and they (including me) lapped up his murderous, over-the-top antics.

In Books Of Magic, arguably his closest brush with the mainstream DC Universe, he used all of DCU's magic and supernatural related characters as the catalysts for Tim Hunter's awakening to the world of Magic. Not since the 1985 Blue Devil Annual have I seen the likes of Phantom Stranger, the Demon Etrigan, Zatanna, Black Orchid, etc. in one book. Yes, I'm a sucker for all these get-togethers and what an awesome congregation it is. From the Stranger to Dr. Occult to John Constantine to Mr. E, Gaiman serves up a massive yet coherent tour of the magical realms of DC, all these coupled with unmatched painted art.  Also, reading this book in the Harry Potter era (it was published way, way before the Sorceror's Stone), one cannot hide a suspicious thought that J.K. Rowling may have read this book before she wrote young Harry's adventures. There are startling \\"coincidences\\" from young Tim's mundane origins to his appearance (glasses!) down to his owl familiar.  Heck, it's this Books of Magic is even better than Harry Potter!	2004-02-17

This volume does not contain a single story arc but is rather a compilation of stand alone stories, each focusing on a specific team member. Each story is interesting but the one that stands out is the one centered on Jukko's. Despite being a member that's tasked to hunt down rogue \\"post-humans\\", he himself has some superhuman traits. Micah Wright has intriguingly teased the readers that Jukko can have a stand alone comic of his own, since we see him doing bits of crime fighting in a big city like New York. The only complaint with this compilation, unlike Volume 1, is it ended with a cliffhanger, a blatant sales ploy so readers will be forced to buy Volume 3. Well, I'm not complaining about buying another Team Achilles compilation but they should do it real SOON!	2004-02-17

Mr. Eco is in top form here, mixing history, comedy and wordplay but also, his penchant for obscure facts and dense writing are also part of the package. The novel starts out fast enough for an Eco book. The title character who seemed to be inspired by Baron Munchausen, and his cohorts seem like interesting people, the kind you would want to have drinks with in a pub or tavern somewhere. However, things bog down when Baudolino and friends embark on their search for Prester John. Yes, it's vividly written but there are lots of idle conversation that the story suddenly plods along. In fairness, it helps in conveying the idleness and the slow passage of time the characters experience. It's a fun medieval story but I still think The Name Of The Rose is still the best Eco work.	2004-02-14

In fact, its effect has very crucial repercussions in the Wildstorm Universe. I feel it's the most unexpected ending for a series (when was the last time you saw characters from another company obliterate the title group?), and even though the overall book can be improved, it's a worthy read. However, since this was the first Stormwatch book I picked up (my last one was during the Jim Lee/Brandon Choi era, so at least I was familiar with some of the characters), I share the sentiment that it would've been better if there was an idiot's guide in this TPB so it can be more accessible to the readers. Otherwise, it's good and I'm looking forward to buying more of the Stormwatch collected editions.	2004-02-14

I missed the boat during that time, so when the TPB came out, I quickly picked it up, read it and wondered why all the hype?<br />It's a pretty standard detective/gangster story, jazzed up with appearances by Batman's Rogues Gallery. I remember the hype back then on who was the killer, and the revelation is not that surprising, in fact, it's a little anti-climactic. Maybe in this day and age of CSI, the audience is a little sharp on red herrings and false leads. On its own, it's a solid Batman story, it's just that Long Halloween doesn't deserve to be labeled/hyped as the best or a classic.	2004-02-14

It's about a group of elite soldiers tasked to police superhumans. It's tautly written and intense. Wright pulls no punches. The plot hook itself is intriguing, how can seemingly normal people match up with beings with powers of gods. You'll find yourself rooting for the characters, even if they're amoral and machiavellian. Maybe it's because Wright presents his argument well. It's just that Whilce Portacio's art, once the best in my book, has shown its limitations in terms of facial expressions and story-telling prevents it from getting the top rating.	2004-02-13

Contrary to other reviewers, I found the second one just as exciting and interesting as the first. It shows that Alan Moore is not afraid to shake up what he started. Kevin O'Neill's art is also amazing as it captures the series alternate Victorian Era setting. My only disappointment is the non-inclusion of other literary characters (Frankenstein's monster, Joseph Conrad's Secret Agent and Phineas Fogg comes to mind), or if they were there I missed it and could've hoped for a bigger role, but then again, Mr. Moore could already be cooking up more surprises hopefully in the near future.<br />I just hope Hollywood stops at bastardizing this excellent piece of work.	2004-02-13

Although his distinctive style is already pretty evident here, there's still something innocent and naive with the way he portrays he characters, unlike the tormented figures you see in Spawn and McFarlane Toys. As a collection, it's a hodge-podge, there's no clear story arc and time hasn't been kind to David Michelinie's writing style (unlike Frank Miller -- his early Daredevil work still packs a punch and is still fresh even if it was done 20 years ago). It's a basically a collection of stand-alone stories from the first appearance of Venom to guestings by second stringers like Silver Sable, Power Man and Iron Fist and the Prowler. I would like to make a special mention of that minor Marvel character. I don't know if the Prowler is McFarlane's idea but the way he drew him back then, it seems he was already doing the prototype for Spawn. From the cape to the design of the mask to the African American alter-ego, the similarities to his creation is very evident. The book is worth checking out just for that. All in all, the book is entertaining and brings back memories of my childhood/teen years.	2004-01-28

Frank Miller's run has not only defined Daredevil. It has defined comics as well.	2004-01-28

I've read it again, and replace the protagonists, it seems to have been ripped from the headlines of late 2001. Did Clancy actually gave the terrorists the idea? I don't know.  <BR>He is truly an astute researcher and has a sharp analytical mind on the geo-political situation of the world that any far-fetched idea seems plausible. To prove it, before 9/11, such an ending will be dismissed as &quot;too far-out&quot;, but not anymore.  <br />Debt Of Honor, I must say, is one of the better Clancy novels.	2003-10-24

Things are made more interesting by the appearance of a very likely suspect. However, logic and plausability were thrown out the window by the time the resolution came in. It's as if Patterson was thinking &quot;what more incredulous coincidences can I come up with?&quot;. Also, do we really need that epilogue? Isn't better just to leave things hanging quite a bit so as the reader can have something to think about? But no, Patterson (or his editor) chose to dumb down an otherwise OK book with that unnecessary epilogue.	2003-10-09

However, he seems to be losing his touch with City of Bones. The story started out well but faltered 2/3 of the way. You'll know who is the killer when he is introduced, so there's no surprise at the end. Harry Bosch, despite all the back cover blurbs saying it would change him forever, is still the same, the ending notwithstanding. Maybe we're getting numbed by the current CSI, The Shield, Boomtown, Law &amp; Order assault, but then again, that's just me.	2003-09-25

I think he can be a very good fiction writer, which is essentially what Dead Season is. I am a Philippine resident and I have read similiar accounts of the events Berlow mentioned. Yes, there are cover ups and the usual government corruption, but what I think was foul was his irresponsible descriptions of some people, which brings no value, except picture Berlow as a racist.	2003-09-25

This is the first Patterson book I've read, and my impression of him hasn't changed. His plots are predictable (a judgment made after seeing Kiss The Girls and Along Came A Spider films) and lacks suspense. The way the story is written is like a proposal, there's not much detail and the way he portrays African Americans is very stereotypical, right down the food they eat. Although he has a noble attempt to deviate from the who is the killer plotline (we know who did the murders in the 2nd chapter), you'll know it's something they did in the past and someone is trying to erase it plotline. After reading Nelson Demille and other authors that dabbled in military conspiracies, I've made a conclusion that Patterson should not have strayed into this genre.	2003-09-24
US	52633914	R89NLTG7UUV52	0971977550	66304600	30 Days Of Night	Books	3	2	3	N	N	All style, little substance	First, the good points: The art is absolutely amazing. Ben Templesmith combines Bill Sienkewicz and Dave McKean strokes to create an eerie atmosphere for the story. The concept is excellent too, a group of vampires invading a small town covered by a month of night (How come Finland doesn't have it's share of famous vampire stories?). However, the way it is written failed to exploit the intriguing plot concept. It all seemed shallow and it became unoriginal. There are also glaring loopholes: Like for a small town, how come the vampires needed a month to wipe them all out? Wouldn't the vampires overrun the town by the 1st week? For a small town, there seemed to be too many people. The description is correct - it's like Night of The Living Dead redux, all because it seemed like a B-movie.	2003-06-15

Considering it was done way back in 1983 (where cyberpunk was at its zenith), the story is still gripping. You could see where most movies, comics, games and tv series of today got their ideas.  It's a must have.	2003-05-13

Funny, action-packed and sometimes poignant are some of the adjectives I'll use to describe his stories. With this collected edition of his first mini-series, you could see the developmental evolution of Deadpool. In this book, the villains, the stories and other characters were lame, and Deadpool was pushing the edge of corny and contrived. There was an interesting subplot with Domino but the book concentrated on some forgettable villain. I'm sorry Mr. Nicieza. Even if Deadpool was your creation, it was Joe Kelly who made him my and other fan's favorite.	2003-05-13

It is chockful of literary references (i.e. Rue Morgue, the Artful Dodger, Fu Manchu, etc.). The characters are multi-faceted not just plain good and evil. Captain Nemo is excellent. I only have praises for this book.	2003-05-02

What the creators did with The Russian is more apt for a Deadpool book rather than the gritty, grim world of Frank Castle (However, I enjoyed the &quot;team-up&quot; of Spidey and Castle). It seems the Ennis and Dillon are trying very hard to be cool and relive the glory days of their Preacher run (which I enjoyed by the way).	2003-05-02

Moreso, his writing style, which is informative yet not dry; truthful yet it reads like a novel. I think the title Fire sums up all his articles. From forest fires to conflagrations from the different flashpoints of the world to the passions burning inside people doing their dangerous jobs. <br />Looking forward to his next collection of articles (His Vanity Fair article about the Kosovo Sex Trade is a must-read).	2003-04-22
US	52633914	R375DMX6CN4UN9	051513175X	59736501	The Descent	Books	3	3	4	N	N	OK book	First off, I enjoyed reading this book. However, I cannot agree with all of the praises posted here. The book is a mixed bag with strong good points but some nagging bad points. <br />First, the good. Jeff Long (or his nameless copy editor, as he said in the acknowledgements) writes vivid, cinematic set pieces. I can fully visualize the underworld, the hadals and the action. Another going for this book is the fresh subject matter about the existence of demons and how he linked it to our history.<br />Which is also a starting point for my nits: Conceptually, the book is awesome but when the author wrote it down, I feel he could've milked the suspense by delaying the &quot;colonization, exploitation and pacification&quot; parts of the plot. I feel he has enough to have a trilogy but unfortunately, he felt to pack it all in one novel. Another thing is, although there are interesting plot threads like Satan's deceptions through history and the ultimate revelation of who he is. Again, I felt it was rushed. As if he is in a hurry to finish the story. I could've traded the detailed account of the limestone formations for the Beowulf Club's investigations. <br />Still, it is an enjoyable book and well worth the read.	2003-01-20

But instead, I got a book that has its first half focusing on the aftermath of the siege of Praag and its title characters seeing miniscule amount of action. I have no expectations of philosphical quandaries or moral dilemmas for this series. I want action, action, action and action. Sadly, there are few and far between and Gotrek is given little chances to plow through hordes of enemies. Heck, he didn't even get to face mano-a-mano the title villain.	2002-12-24

Books	3	3	4	N	N	Insightful yet hard to follow	Mr. Kiyosaki's view of the world is really an eye-opener. His insights are very helpful. Yet, the way he presented it, it is very irritating and confusing. I can stand his oft repeated passages but what got my goat was in one section he was leading the reader to how to get something yet he withholds it to a later chapter. I now forgot what it is.<br />Self-made men are usually stubborn. Most of the time, they reached the top without listening to what the others said. But Mr. Kiyosaki, I am aware of your point being a best-selling author not best-writing author schtick, but please listen to your editor.	2002-11-26

Despite a new batch of authors, the listed places were almost a direct lift of Jens Peters' work (including the ommission of Bulacan). What is different is the condescending way it is written. After reading the guidebook, you would think the Philippines is there with Afghanistan, Liberia, Rwanda and other wartorn countries. Although there are dangers, the risk level in Manila is about the same as any other major city in the world.	2002-06-04

The book is way too long, underedited, in fact. The author wasted a good number of pages explaining things that are obvious to readers. This style may be  beneficial to young fans but with themes like pedophilia and  sado-masochism, it is clearly a mature book without the mature writing  style. Yes, Mr. Goodkind is inventive in his plot twists and  characterizations, the overall plot is a cliche.  He also crammed the  interesting parts near the end. As a result, the ending was rushed since  too many important events are happening without much explanation. Probably  because he devoted too much time on the little things (a crime the Wheel of  Time series is also guilty of). I'd rather read Feist's books. Even if the  plots are cliche, they are still good reading...	2000-05-07

Having read 4 books of the series, I don't have an idea what the fuss is  all about. Jordan's worlds are derivative, characters are too melodramatic  and the pacing is rambling and plodding. Heck, I have to wake myself up  just to follow what's happening to Rand (a.k.a Luke Skywalker) al'Thor.  Just goes to show that even if a book has a lot of critical praise in it,  it's still not for everyboday	1998-08-23

And by using a mystery as a  vehicle, this book is very readable and &quot;unputdownable&quot;. However,  since this is her first book, her plotting needs room for improvement. A  reader can guess the resolution halfway through the book. Still, it is a  good first effort and I am hoping the next Saro Ichiro novels will be  tighter and unpredictable.	1998-08-23

And mix in comic-book/TV show quality characters like a master kung-fu artist, a RuPaul like hooker, a lawyer ala Danny de Vito in The Rainmaker, among others and you have a nice prime time P.I. action-comedy series.	1998-07-23
