Although an excellent study if all of this is true, it remains to be seen whether it is in fact true.  Herdt admits that the name of the Sambia is a fake name that he gave them to protect their identity.  There is therefore no way for other researchers to study this tribe and compare notes.  How do we know that this tribe exists at all?  All of the other studies of homosexual customs among New Guinea tribesman describe sodomy as their exclusive mode of behaviour.  The Sambia are the one and only tribe of this region to practice fellatio.  Why is this tribe out of sync with all of the other tribes?  It makes me wonder.	2004-06-09

Symons worked on it for 15 years, and it was published in 1986.  Symons has been called the enfant terrible of Canadian literature.  I noticed that none of his books has been reviewed on this website, and almost all of them are out of print.  This novel is probably his best work, and it shows how he got his reputation.  He knows how to write and the novel is lively and entertaining, but it is also offensive.  It is not the Morocco that I was familiar with.  It is a sex tourist fantasy in which Morocco is supposedly crawling with youths, always black ones, who are sexually available to frustrated tourists who need to be taught how to lose their inhibitions.  In other words, it is about exploitation.  I, for one, soon tired of the endless explicit descriptions of bodies and sex acts.  The author's fixation on the male organ amounts to a monomania.  I am no prude, but I was disgusted.	2004-06-04

Baronet Anstruther of that ilk, a Scot who has written other books about the Victorians, has waded through a mountain, nay, an Everest of correspondence in search of the truth.  This is a balanced biography which touches upon all sides of Browning's life, which normally is a good thing, but one could wish that Anstruther, who is likely to be the only person to wade through the archive, could have enlarged the book by fifty or a hundred pages and devoted much more space to the details of Browning's interest in boys.  In the long run, Browning will be remembered only as a pederast, an example of how such things were done in those days, and therefore the author should have recognized this and played it up.  But what he does say is quite interesting.	2004-06-03

The long preface of this novel is more famous than the novel itself, but let us talk about the novel.  It is not clear just when the action takes place, somewhere between 1650 and 1835, but it doesn't really take place in a particular period, nor does it take place in the real world.  It is a sort of fantasy in spite of not having any supernatural elements.  It is based in part on Shakespeare's As You Like It, with Rosalind and Orlando being replaced by Maupin and D'Albert.  It is somewhat confusing, as the author switches viewpoints from chapter to chapter without warning.  Sometimes it is Maupin speaking, sometimes D'Albert, sometimes the author.  Gautier worshipped the beauty of the physical and artistic worlds, which is the whole point of the novel.  He tends to identify beauty with female beauty, but there are also swans and roses and nightingales and the moon and so much else.  It is the most romantic novel ever written.  Some readers may be annoyed by Gautier's penchant for description.  In one passage, he takes two whole pages just to describe an old tapestry which has nothing to do with the plot.  One needs some footnotes if one is not perfectly familiar with all of the learned references that are scattered throughout the novel.  In one passage, Gautier mentions a seraglio and a handkerchief being dropped.  This refers to the habit of the Turkish sultan of going to his seraglio or harem and dropping a handkerchief in front of the bed partner he has chosen for the night.  But Gautier assumes that the reader knows about this and doesn't explain it.  There is a lot of what might be called pseudo-homosexuality in the novel, men and women falling in love with women who are disguised as men, only to find out in the end their true sexual identity.  The anguish of D'Albert upon thinking that heis in love with a man reads awfully silly to modern audiences that find nothing wrong with this.  But it turns out that everybody in the novel is really heterosexual.  There is a sex scene at the end, but this novel is far from being pornographic.  It used to have a reputation of being a Dirty French Novel, but faded from popularity in the United States after real pornography made people realize how tame Gautier is in comparison.  He seems to have been more interested in art than life.  He can think of nothing better to compare a beautiful woman to than a statue or painting of a woman.  There is not the slightest vulgarity or lapse of taste anywhere in the novel.  Some passages are breathtaking.  It is a shame that this novel failed to catch fire when Joanna Richardson translated it for Penguin Classics in the early 1980s.  It had previously been in Random House's Modern Library series with a dust jacket showing two pairs of shoes, one male and one female, left outside a hotel room door to be cleaned.  Gautier's humor is dry and charming.  I love this book, but don't expect to find hordes buying it.  It is for the few.	2004-05-25

But it soon becomes evident that the real agenda of the authors is to use the crime case as an excuse for attacking the Mormon church.  All of the Mormon leaders are presented as scoundrels and all of the followers are presented as fools.  In short, Mormonism is demonized.  The book is full of cheap shots.  No stone is left unturned in the authors' quest to ridicule Mormonism.  This is out of place in a true-crime book and hopelessly detracts and distracts from the narrative.  We are expected to believe that two-thirds of the inhabitants of an American state are scoundrels and fools.  Nonsense!	2004-04-12

I believe that it was the only book on the subject at that time.  I discovered what the name and nature of my disorder was, and that there were a lot of people who had the same problem.  Unfortunately, I gave up the struggle in 1975 and did nothing about it until 1992.  From then on, I slowly managed to desensitize myself to the world outside of my neighborhood.  I can now make trips of hundreds of miles without a reaction.  It is my own fault for not trying harder or sooner.

He was a friend of Lawrence of Arabia and it is with Arabia that he is identified -- not the real Arabia, but a fantasy Arabia that was the locale of a play called Hassan, which was produced with music by Delius.  At his best he is wonderful -- &quot;the dragon-green, the luminous, the dark, the serpent-haunted sea&quot;!  One of his finest achievements was to write two poems, &quot;Pillage&quot; and &quot;The War-song of the Saracens&quot;, which present the same situation from the viewpoints of the conquerors and the conquered, both poems being in the same metrical structure, but the first one being languid and the other one energetic.	2004-03-04

And I might add that this would be a good book to read in conjunction with Mann's Death in Venice.	2004-02-24

Many of the articles are written by the editors, i.e., Wayne Dynes, William Percy (brother of Walker Percy) and \\"Warren Johansson\\" (Joseph Wallfield, died 1994).  There are some leading themes or theories that run throughout this massive work, one of which is to blame Christianity for all of the problems encountered by modern homosexuals.  This puts this work in opposition to John Boswell's theory that the Catholic church was slow to adopt a hostile attitude.  Homosexuality is taken as a given, and all hostile theories are refuted.  It does not occur to the editors that all human (and indeed, gendered) bodies are heterosexually designed, and homosexual acts are thus performed with bodies which are not designed with such acts in mind.  This objection is more or less ignored.  The article on Burma had nothing to say, so I wonder why it was included.  Much else could be said about so massive a work, but let me say that it is worth reading as long as the reader keeps an open mind.	2003-11-25

It contains an enormous amount of information about homosexuality in past ages and in the world of that period when it was published.  It unfortunately was based on the outdated theory of the third sex, in which \\"real\\" homosexuals are assumed to fit the fairy stereotype.  But one can look past this nonsense to the facts stored in this massive compendium of knowledge.  The list of famous homosexuals seems to me to contain a number of dubious entries based on flimsy evidence, and there is only the list of names without any details or explanation.

He seems to have invented the idea of it as it evolved through the early stages of the homosexual civil rights movement, but it appears that a concept of homosexuality already existed in his day, and he merely expressed what so many were thinking and feeling.  Unfortunately, he made much of the difference between what used to be known as inverts and perverts; he said that it was wrong to incarcerate born homosexuals, but it was OK to incarcerate men who were heterosexual but who were involved in homosexual behaviour, e.g., hustlers.  This suggestion appears to us today to be outrageous.  One should at least give him credit for having the guts to stand up in a convention of lawyers in the 1860s and speak in favor of decriminalization of sodomy.  His theory of the basic effeminacy of gay men has had a bad effect of promotion of the stereotype of the fairy.  The outlandish jargon in which he tried to categorize homosexuals of all sorts has not been transmitted to us.  It would be easy enough to see his outlook as narrow and bizarre.  It must be remembered that he had nobody at all preceding him in this field, he had only his feelings and a rudimentary gay subculture with no books or magazines on the subject.

But even if one does not agree with this, one can still enjoy this book as finely written.	2003-11-05

Massenet made an opera out of this novel.  It is intended as an attack on Christianity, but if one can look at the monk as an individual and not as a representative of Christianity, even Christian readers can appreciate this study of human weakness.	2003-11-05

The whole point of this book, one of his best, is that what is believed about the Christian/Jewish deity is similar to what has been believed about deities of other religions, the implication being, I suppose, that there is nothing unique about Christianity, and that it is derived from these other religions.  One could just as easily reverse this theory and say that the other religions derive from the Bible.	2003-10-28

This used to be considered a classic, but it has sadly faded with time in the face of the loss of innocence.  To those who love calmness and virtue, it has its charms.  To those who love excitement and sin, it has nothing to say.  The climax, where Virginia allows herself to drown rather than get into a lifeboat in a storm because she is in her underwear and is too modest to let the sailors see her thus, is an absurdity to all but the most fanatical devotees of modesty.  And it is precisely this climax and its absurdity that have destroyed this book.	2003-10-28

It was written by a psychotherapist from the old point of view, the view of homosexuality as a disease.  Every chapter, almost every page, of this lengthy book drips with hostility to homosexuals.

I liked it so much that I read it again when I was twelve, and again at thirteen.  I went on to read several other stories by the same author, but they have gone out of print, and only this story has lived.  It is a masterpiece that (as nobody seems to have noticed in their reviews) is based on Jules Verne's Five Weeks in a Balloon.  I strongly recommend this story for all kids who love adventure and Verne's brand of science fiction.  The illustrations are great.	2003-08-11

Unfortunately, I found the book boring.  Somehow, I failed to relate to it.  Maybe if I had heard of Tabucci and these other cultural figures, I might have gotten something more out of it.  I visited Lisbon in 1966 and enjoyed it, and I am fluent in Portuguese, so the problem is hardly Lisbon.  But the book just seemed to me to never get off the ground.	2003-07-28

If this book were to appear for the first time today, it would be hooted down and angry letters would be sent to the publisher, demanding that it be withdrawn.  The author would receive death threats.  Such is the course of social evolution.  I would say that Smith's knowledge of the subject is wonderful and his handling of it is perfect.  The only fault, a minor one, is that he mistakenly thought that Cuthbert Wright was British and included him; Wright was in fact an American and is out of place here.	2002-11-21

I am not going to waste time repeating my lengthy original review.  Let me just say that it was the worst rubbish ever.  The author is a homosexual Marxist who thinks that homosexuality is not out of sync with Marxism, even though there is tons of evidence to the contrary.  Worse yet, the author is, um, eccentric in many of his attitudes and opinions (I am being polite; I wasn't polite in my original review).  Fernbach believes, for example, that communist revolutions have already taken place on other planets.  Fernbach belongs to the category of people like Judy Grahn and Andrea Dworkin, in more ways than one.   His theory that homosexuality can be somehow combined with communism to improve the human race is such a hoot.  He himself is a living example of the failure of human evolution along such lines.  I rated this piece of garbage with one star only because I could not rate it with none.	2001-05-01

The translation came out in 1989 in Amsterdam and is also out of print.  It is the story of a forbidden love affair between a male teacher aged 28 and a male student aged 14.  Considering the nature of the relationship and the fact that the teacher was messed up (a self portrait of the author), it is a wonder that the relationship continued into the adulthood of the boy.  It is very well written and convincing.  As the book says, the relationship could have ended in disaster but ended in love.  It had a sequel which I translated, but the translation never appeared.	2001-04-19
