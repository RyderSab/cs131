The book is named after one of the stories. The other two are called \\"The Doum Tree of Wad Hamid,\\" and \\"A Handful of Dates.\\" Each tale has the universal feel of a fable -- the wisdom they encode in their simple language can speak to anyone, anywhere, anytime. The Muslim characters have a few traits which could seem odd to Western readers, but basically they are just like small town folks all over the world. They walk with dignity, they live in peace amidst old friends and loved ones, and they cherish their own dreams of love and happiness.<br />The title story is my favorite. Zein is sort of a \\"holy fool\\" in his little village. He is not exactly retarded, or crazy, but is clearly eccentric. He seems to promote laughter and good feelings wherever he goes, although sometimes this is at his own expense. Many of the villagers laugh at him. All of the villagers laugh with him. Zein seems unaware that there could be a distinction between these groups of people, and, perhaps, therein lies his potential for healing... He is betrothed to the beautiful, solemn, almond-eyed Ni'ma, before whom he has NEVER made a fool of himself. She, and she alone, holds this honor... Their courtship, and the impact it has upon the village, comprises a highly provocative, and ultimately warm, view into human nature. You won't forget this comedic, yet highly serious, love story.<br />Taken together, these stories really got me thinking about what it's like to live in an average Muslim village. It makes me want to know these people better, they're nice people, just like anyone else.	2003-04-28

The delicate watercolors adorning the pages of this thin volume are heavy with horror, and they give a real, first-person, child's perspective on the unprecedented nightmare that was the bombing of Hiroshima.<br />I don't like the way that so many reviewers attempt to diminish the power of this book, by placing it in certain contexts which implicitly subtract from its immediacy.  Why not at least partly read it as it was intended -- as a testimonial of the confusing, unexpected, heartbreaking experiences of a seven year old girl trying to deal with an atom bomb destroying her hometown, her home, and much of her family?  Your heart will break for little Mii, wandering among the ruins, and half-sleeping in a frightened daze for several days on a nearby beach.<br />Just to make sure that you are prepared for anything, you might want to know that most of the illustrations depict survivors with all their clothes burned off.  Most of the book has nude images, so... know your audience!  If you plan to share this with particularly immature boys, for example, you might want to be aware of this little fact in advance.  The horror of the whole setting is so powerful that many readers will hardly even notice this, but I thought it bore mentioning.<br />Young readers today overwhelmingly tend to have little or no sense of the range of nuclear weapons, in terms of destructive power.  I would like to encourage librarians, parents, or teachers who purchase this excellent book, to explain to their frightened little audiences that this is an account of a particular, specific, historic atomic blast.  The power of such weapons today has an exponential range.  For example, a small \\"dirty bomb\\" could literally constitute a couple of sticks of regular dynamite, combined with a few grams of radioactive strontium 90.  At the other end of the spectrum, today's gigantic multi-megaton weapons, particularly those with multiple warheads, could deliver several thousand times as much destructive force as the Hiroshima bomb, in a single nanosecond.  If you would like to prepare yourself to better answer such questions on the part of young readers, I would like to encourage you in the strongest imaginable terms to purchase a copy of \\"The New Nuclear Danger,\\" by the pediatrician and human rights activist Dr. Helen Caldicott.  \\"The New Nuclear Danger\\" has a really terrific bibliography at the end, including both websites and books.<br />The majority of people reading this review are likely to be from the USA, so I'd just like to quickly inject here a couple of relevant comments.  World War II is an increasingly distant, misty memory for Americans on the whole.  I think that this book makes us see how a horrible war can tend to define us, as little as we like to think that this can happen, in the eyes of ourselves and of others.  Vietnam clearly engaged America as a divided \\"society,\\" as opposed to engaging us as a united \\"nation.\\"  People enjoy the memories of the feeling of rebelling against the authority of our government -- hey, the 60s were an exhilarating time to be alive in the USA.  Thinking about World War II, instead of Vietnam, can help us to see that, ultimately, the act of coming to terms with the wars we might wage should not be all about their divisive effect upon our own society, so much as it should be about the absolutely hideous, nightmarish, lethal horrors we can unleash upon the members of the societies we are attacking.  \\"Hiroshima No Pika\\" makes this point both starkly and accessibly, and for this reason, among many others, it should be included in as many public and private collections as possible.ds, could deliver several thousand times as much destructive force as the Hiroshima bomb, in a single nanosecond.

US	52797729	RXBR8R3L5RMWA	0140094199	408200678	When the Wind Blows	Books	4	25	33	N	N	Please buy this book!	Raymond Briggs here presents us with a disarmingly gentle, warm, humorous graphic novel, about a regular blue collar couple trying to understand, and to prepare for, the ultimate catastrophe.<br />This touching little book came out in the early 80s, when there was a sharp spike in international public awareness of the dangers of nuclear warfare. Due largely to Ronald Reagan's hawkish presidency, people were much more fearful of this looming prospect -- and, of course, rightly so. Reading this reminds me of 1981, when I was in eighth grade, and tensions over Poland were so severe that I recall becoming a regular fixture at our local library, reading and reading, trying helplessly to understand all the forces which, it seemed, were conspiring to destroy us all.<br />The really touching thing, about the couple portrayed in this book, is that they are normal people. Almost completely uninformed about the world, their mental picture of the world is shaped by a haze of half-remembered patriotic propaganda that is decades out of date, and was heavily distorted to begin with. Their efforts to prepare for a nuclear attack are so pathetic that you would laugh, if you weren't already busy crying.<br />Those weapons are still out there. This book is important. Everyone should read it. If you half-suspect that you yourself might be slightly un-informed about nuclear war issues, I would like to recommend that you seek out \\"The New Nuclear Danger,\\" by Dr. Helen Caldicott. It just came out in 2002, and includes a fantastic bibliography which could help you understand nuclear winter, medical effects of fallout, and current weapon stockpiles. There is also a great collection of relevant websites, which we should all be a lot more familiar with.... if you'd like to communicate you concern to your kids with another illustrated book, aimed at a younger audience, I would like to recommend \\"Hiroshima No Pika,\\" by Toshi Maruki.<br />You may also like to seek out \\"Threads,\\" a tremendous docudrama on nuclear war done in consultation with Carl Sagan, in 1984. \\"Threads\\" is out of print, except in the UK, but you can find it on the largest online auction houses if you put the terms \\"threads\\" and \\"nuclear\\" in the search field.<br />So, if you know anyone who actually went out and bought duct tape in February, 2003, I would like to recommend that you sit down with them, and spend an hour leafing through this horrifying book. Two miserable thumbs way, way, way up.	2003-03-11
US	52797729	R1V9IB4IPQYYLZ	080761355X	483609500	For Rushdie: Essays by Arab and Muslim Writers in Defense of Free Speech	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Helped Me to Understand the Diversity of Islam	Given the gravity of this topic, I think that it is important explicitly to point out, to whoever reads this, that I am not an expert or an authority on Islam, in any way.  However, like so many of us in these troubled times, I am trying to learn all that I can about the modern complexities of Islam.  Probably most of you reading this are in the same frame of mind that I am!  Therefore, in this humble capacity, I would like to share my thoughts on this brave, fascinating, timely anthology.  <br />This book includes a selection of approximately one hundred essays, poems, and songs, by a vast array of thinkers, all writing from the very heart of the Islamic tradition.  The voices collected here speak in a variety of modes, ranging from the literary, to the religious, to the philosophical.  Some are heartfelt and emotional: others tough, rational, and lawyerly.  All, however, join in emphatically, lucidly, intelligently criticizing Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa against the author Salman Rushdie.  All speak from an Islamic perspective -- indeed, there is even an opinion expressed by an actual Iranian ayatollah,  Djalal Gandjeih.<br />These essays were originally penned by Islamic intellectuals in a wide-ranging panoply of occupations.  Represented here are filmmakers, newspaper columnists, poets, psychoanalysts, sociologists, and more.  They come from many countries.  People familiar with Islam might not be surprised to find essays by relatively laid-back Moroccans, but there are also many sane, calm, clearly articulated  voices coming out of Syria, Libya, Sudan... all over the Islamic world.  What this variegated population of thinkers has in common, is an uncommon willingness to speak out, for what their faith tells them is right.<br />As an American, I was often struck by the kinship of spirit that many of these voices hold, to all that is best in my own country's heritage.  If you read these essays, I can promise you that again and again, you will find yourself reminded of the First Amendment!  The philosophical framework may differ, but the essential spirit of many of these essays cleaves to a very similar idea to (part of) that which the First Amendment embodies -- freedom of speech.  I suppose that these essays demonstrate that what is best in humanity is, after all, universal, and might be expected to crop up in any society on Earth...  I can tell you this much, I wish some of these Islamic thinkers were speaking out in America, during the McCarthy era!  Their sane, fearless, moderating influence, even founded in the Islamic tradition, might well have had a highly beneficial impact upon the extremist, terror-laden, American political climate of the fifties.  It may sound unusual to some readers that an Islamic religious philosopher from Syria could conceivably be more rational, reasonable, and worth listening to than a U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, but, well, if you have trouble with the idea, you really might want to read this book.  That's the value of the book to me personally -- it helps me to understand how much of the Islamic world can be sane, calm, humanistic, and sometimes even brilliant.<br />I would like to point out a few small, structural and stylistic issues about the book.  For one thing -- writers are arranged alphabetically by last name.  However, if you happen to be looking for a particular writer, you may need to roam around a little in the table of contents.  For example, authors whose last name begins with \\"El\\" are sometimes listed under \\"E\\", and sometimes under the other part of their last name.  Just be alert to that, and also to similar, possible alphabetizing errors that a copywriter might make, in transcribing from one alphabet to another.  For browsing purposes, you might like to know that the table of contents includes each essay's author's name, country of origin, and profession.  This can help you select what you'd like to read, if for example you'd like to clump the essays you approach, one country at a time.  Furthermore, you might want to be aware that this book was originally published in French, and can, on occasion, sound almost distractingly Gallic in tone.  (Not that there's anything wrong with that!  Au contraire, I happen to remain a resolute francophile, despite the country's current lack of standing in the eyes of many Americans.)  Anyway, sometimes the essays can sound oddly French, so just remember that many of the essays are TWO translations away from Arabic, and that they may have picked up a tincture of French stylistic features along the way.<br />Finally, to help you follow a few of the more esoteric, philosophical essays here, I would like to recommend that you consider seeking out a copy of \\"The Political Language of Islam,\\" by Bernard Lewis, and/or \\"A History of Islamic Legal Theories: An Introduction to Sunni Usul Al-Fiqh,\\" by Wael B. Hallaq.<br />Basically, I recommend the living daylights out of this book.  I hope you are able to locate a copy, and if you're feeling ambitious, that you encourage your local librarian to find a way to display this book prominently.  Books like this have the  potential to go a long way toward developing a balanced view of Islam, amongst an all-too-often confused, fearful American populace.	2003-02-26
US	52797729	R1WHBFZ3BG2U26	093853002X	310139297	Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States	Books	5	94	95	N	N	Just Plain Fascinating	In this unusual little book, George R. Stewart has compiled an endlessly intriguing account of the whys and wherefores of American place-names.  The book as a whole provides a haunting, curiously oblique perspective on American history, as he delves into the cultural, historic, and (sometimes) military themes behind the names we use every day.  The book goes into the names of cities, states, rivers, mountains, streets, and more.<br />I think you might get more out of this volume if you are aware of the way it is organized.  I myself half-expected this book to be organized by state, perhaps in alphabetical order.  This is not the case.  Stewart has organized his data by THEMES in naming, and how these themes have emerged in our history.  Therefore, the book (very roughly) follows our history chronologically, as various naming trends have come and gone, in the context of various cultural waves.  This pattern tends to approximately follow the &quot;peopling&quot; of the continent (by descendants of Europeans) from east to west.  Some chapters are mostly devoted to single states, but this is the exception, rather than the rule.<br />The chapter titles are not necessarily always very helpful, which is the closest thing I have to a caveat about this book.  I'm telling you right now that the chapters roughly follow the settling of our continent, from east to west (and from south to north in the far western states).  So, this should help you get oriented if you are browsing around...  You might want to think of each chapter as a little independent essay.  That might help you break the whole text down into digestible parts.<br />Some themes in naming include: the popularity of the name &quot;Columbus,&quot; during and shortly after the Revolution; the tendency to adapt feminine names for the Southern plantations; Greek or Latin names; ancient indian names; English town names given new life on our shores; and many, many more.<br />One interesting fact I learned, reading thisbook, is that five of the six states in my native New England should, technically,  probably be considered to be spelled wrong.  (New Hampshire is the lone, proud exception).  Stewart tells the tale of how each state was named, although he doesn't clump the five stories all together.  You have to do saome digging...  If you happen to harbor an inner, pedantic curmudgeon, who sometimes likes to rail against the stupidity of all humanity apart from him- (your-)self, this is the kind of thing that could give you great, and prolonged, delight.  Also, you might be surprised at how many place-names have warm, human stories behind them.  This can foster a real sense of human connection to our nation's past -- a connection that is not necessarily to participants in our nation's huge struggles, but simply to quiet, thoughtful people who tried to come up with words that just sounded right.<br />I would like to post here a private theory I have about George R. Stewart, which may be of interest to you in this context.  Professor Stewart taught English at Berkeley, for much of the twentieth century.  Concurrently on the faculty at that institution was the great American anthropologist Alfred Kroeber, who today is perhaps best remembered for his work with the last Yahi indian, Ishi, and also for his status as the father of acclaimed science fiction author Ursula Kroeber LeGuin.  This last-named person, Ursula K. LeGuin, would have grown up hearing about Professor Stewart, and his odd hobby of place-names.  If you read her young adult fantasy trilogy, the Earthsea Trilogy, you will find there a character called the Master Namer, who is a sort of professor in a school for young wizards.  He and his classes exhibit many of the traits that we find in evidence within &quot;Names on the Land.&quot; I believe that Ursula K. LeGuin probably based this character upon the fascinating George R. Stewart, and his hobby.  Therefore, if you enjoy this book, you may wish to read Ursula LeGuin's&quot;A Wizard of Earthsea,&quot; to encounter there a thinly disguised fictional version of Professor Stewart.<br />At any rate, this book is really something special.  I recommend that you seek out a copy, and if you know a local history teacher, maybe you could lend it to him and suggest that he fashion some lesson plans from its singularly neato contents.  Two thumbs up!	2002-12-19

The Mahicans mostly lived along the Hudson River valley in New York, but they also sometimes ventured into far western Massachusetts, and along the Housatonic River in western Connecticut. The so-called Stockbridge indians, of western Massachusetts, were Mahicans. Schmick lived from 1714 to 1778, and his missionary work was done after 1751. He was a gifted and beloved musician, and schoolteacher, and he mastered the native Mahican tongue in around 1754.<br />Carl Masthay has done a lot of work to reproduce Schmick's eighteenth century work, and to package it in such a way that anyone can appreciate it. That's why I've entitled this review \\"A labor of love\\" -- I'm referring to Carl Masthay's exemplary editorial work. Although now that I think of it, Schmick was certainly executing his own labor of love, in his day.<br />Don't miss the \\"Background and Explanatory Description,\\" given as an introduction right at the beginning of the volume. This section discusses the historic need for a dictionary of this sort, and Carl Masthay's motivation for compiling this edition of Schmick's old manuscript. It talks about the historic background of the old Moravian missionaries, and their interactions with the Mahicans. There is also a nice thumbnail sketch of the life and times of Johann Jacob Schmick in this section. Interestingly, Masthay also includes a discussion of the linguistic diversity in the land of Schmick's birth. and the psychological impact that this diversity could have had upon him. The rest of this section is mostly devoted to a technical (but accessible) discussion of Mahican's place amongst the Eastern Algonquian languages. There is also a small bibliography of books dealing with Mahican history, and a map of the provenance, the territory, of the Mahican tribe.<br />David Pentland, the co-editor of the authoritative \\"Bibliography of Algonquian Linguistics,\\" and one of the world's leading authorities on the topic, has contributed an historical phonology. If you come to this book from an interest in the Mahicans, rather than in linguistics, this section will probably just confuse you. Let me save you some trouble. This section can be skipped over, if you're impatient to get to the actual dictionary and start reading some Mahican hymns, etc. Pentland's section is written for trained linguists. It shows what some of the more important, regularly observed changes are believed to have occurred, as Mahican evolved from an earlier \\"Proto-Algonquian\\" language. Proto-Algonquian was an ancestor language of Mahican, in the same sense that Latin was an ancestor language of French, Spanish, Italian, etc. Algonquianists have painstakingly reconstructed this lost language, which was never written down, by applying established rules of linguistic change to Algonquian languages that exist today, and making logical inferences about what the languages were like at an earlier stage. To sum up -- read this section if you're prepared for it, but don't worry too much if it's over your head. Move on to the actual dictionary section. Relax.<br />The dictionary itself is a lot of fun. Most verb paradigms are completely fleshed out, so all the work has kindly been done for you. It isn't necessary to get papercuts, referring back and forth to lists of suffixes, etc. Each word is translated from English to Mahican and also to German, in order to help students of the Mahicans in their Moravian context to make better sense of the relevant sources... The dictionary is 123 pages long. Each entry conveniently begins with its English translation. The entries are alphabetized by their English translations, which probably makes more sense than alphabetizing them by the Mahican words, considering that there are no living speakers of the language. However, in case there is a need, at the end of the book there is a Mahican/English glossary and index, alphabetized by the Mahican words.<br />This terrific book is fascinating, and invaluable to have if you want to grapple with the old hymns. Two thumbs up!	2002-10-31

Here you will find photos of refugees of all ages, from all over the world, from a vast panoply of distinct cultures, languages, religions, etc.  The only two things shared by all are their pain, and their humanity.<br />Right at the very beginning of the book, there are over twenty pages of stark black and white photographs.  If you were leafing through these pages, it would be very easy to conclude that there was no text or table of contents, and to give up in despair.  Therefore, I am telling you now, there IS a table of contents, and several accompanying essays as well.  You can find them, starting around twenty pages into the book.<br />Judith Kumin is the official representative for the UNHCR, (that's the United Nations High Commission for Refugees -- why not try to locate their website right now?  I'll wait...), in Germany.   Kumin has contributed a foreword, in which she outlines the overall situation of today's global refugees.  She articulates the aim of the book, which is NOT to put the misery of the refugees on display.  The photographs are intended to show \\"the faces of refugees, laughing and crying... their mourning and their pride, their hope and their despair.\\"  It is hoped that this approach will help to convey the basic human dignity of these dispossessed people, and engender sympathy for their situation.<br />Journalist Hans Christophe Buch contributes another introductory essay, which helps set the mood for the book.  In a concluding essay, photographer/editor Mark Sealy encourages us to ponder these photographs, and the ways that the people in them so heroically cope with intolerable conditions.<br />The body of the book presents photos of refugees coming from or seeking asylum in, eleven nations.  These nations (or regions) include Rwanda, Chechnya, Liberia, Cuba, Germany, the former Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Mexico, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, and Poland.  Each photo essay is preceded by an introductory chronology, which places the region in historical context.  <br />Many of these images will stay with you for some time.  You will see an anonymous Chechnyan man happily playing with his dog, while four enormous, blood-drenched, turreted, expropriated former Soviet tanks brood forebodingly in the background...  You will look into the eyes of a little girl from Afghanistan, resting on her cheap army cot.  She had stepped on a land mine some time in her past, and is resting in the photo because she has become tired, after practicing walking with her new prosthetic limbs...  You will encounter a young African man in a German detention cell, awaiting word from the govermnment on his refugee status.  As he peers out of his barred window, a small television set in his cell shows wild horses gamboling about, frisking their manes, and running free...<br />Several of the most striking photos are not necessarily what you might consider to be particularly artistic.  They get their power simply from the impact of seeing acres, and acres, and acres of dirty little tents, spread out across dry, dusty plains, in the most inhospitable parts of the world.<br />This book is a gripping testament, and deserves to find its way to coffee tables throughout the world.  It's nice having a home to store a coffee table in, eh?  <br />Please buy this book, and spend time thinking about its messages.	2002-10-31
US	52797729	RIOBMQNNVRE9M	0940160633	412118822	Secrets in the Sand: The Archaeology of Cape Cod	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Accessible, Fascinating, and Well Written	This excellent introduction to the archaeology of Cape Cod can open up a whole fascinating world, for anyone who takes the time to read it.  The technical, academic jargon of archaeology is kept to an absolute minimum, and what jargon exists is always painstakingly explained.<br />I'd like to make a few general comments.  First of all, you should be aware that the printer made a small error in the table of contents.  The foreword, introduction, and acknowledgments are numbered in the text with Roman numerals, but in the table of contents they were assigned &quot;normal,&quot; Arabic numerals.  For example, &quot;17&quot; is written in the table of contents as the page number for one prefatory section, as opposed to &quot;XVII.&quot;  This throws off the table of contents for the first couple of chapters.  Please don't give up on the book as a whole because of this minor error -- you'd be making a big mistake.  Just be careful, and spend 2 minutes with a pencil to correct the table of contents in your copy.  For a second general comment, I'd just like to alert you to the fact that this book is almost exclusively devoted to pre-colonial, native American archaeology.  There are a few pages about remains left by the early settlers, in the chapter on Wing Island in Brewster, but most of the book focuses on the pre-historic period.<br />The introduction and foreword are nice to read through.  They contail some personal statements by two people who worked on the book, about the importance of maintaining a childlike sense of wonder, and childlike curiosity.  This excitement and wonder is part and parcel of the book -- we encounter it again, periodically throughout the text, as we read about local students and Cape residents who participate in various excavations.<br />The whole book is peppered with a terrific selection of maps, illustrations, and photographs.  All of them are in black and white.  These visual aids really add a lot to the book, and help to make it more approachable.  I'd like to particularly draw your attention to the two graphic chronologies, or timelines, on pages forty-one and forty-six.  You might want to bookmark those pages, because you'll find yourself referring back to them quite a bit, to get your brain oriented in anthropological or geological time.  One other useful section, that you might want to pay extra close attention to, is the historical overview of Cape Cod archaeology given on pages sixteen and seventeen -- and that's in Arabic numerals, not Roman.<br />Part One is designed as an overview of the topic as a whole.  The chapters here explore the history of the field of study of archaeology on the Cape; an anthropological overview of early native peoples in the region; and a survey of local geological (pre-)history.  The geologic chapter is a good one.  It includes all kinds of maps, illustrating such phenomena as glaciers, dunes, forests, etc.  Make sure you spend some time on these chapters.  They will help you get much more out of the second part of the book, which focuses upon specific sites.<br />Part Two deals with sites at Upper Mill Pond, in Brewster; Sandy Neck, to the north of Barnstable; Pochet, &quot;the dividing place,&quot; in East Orleans; and Wing Island, in Brewster.  A final chapter tries to tie together what you've learned, in an effort to create a composite overview of daily life among the Nauset peoples of Cape Cod.<br />The book finishes up with a glossary of archaeological terminology (which is always very user-friendly, as I mentioned earlier); a bibliography for further reading, and an index.<br />If you enjoy this book, I would like to alert you to the existence of the Massachusetts Archaeological Society.  It's simple to find on the internet.  They maintain a little museum, in Middleborough, which is a terrific resource for the archaeology of the entire state.  If you'd like to specifically learn more about the archaeology of Cape Cod, try using your internet skills to finda website for the Cape Cod Museum of Natural History.  They're the folks behind this fine book.<br />Basically, I really liked this book, and I think you will too.  Two thumbs up.a website for the Cape Cod Museum of Natural History.

Collections, Vol 3)	Books	4	6	6	N	N	An Important Resource	This is the single longest surviving document, in the old Algonquian dialect, of the original native peoples of the New Haven, Connecticut area. The tribe was known as the Quinnipiac tribe. Known today as Quiripi-Unquachog, this dialect was spoken in much of southwestern coastal Connecticut, as well as in parts of Long Island.<br />This booklet contains a two page, 1658 letter, from the Commissioners of the United Colonies, in Boston. They were writing to the directors of the New England Company, back in London. This letter defends their decision to have the Quinnipiac catechism printed in New England rather than back in London. The reasoning seems to have been that this decision allowed for local translators to be nearby, in case translation issues or other problems arose in the course of the printing. The letter also contains some discussion of bills, and concludes with an affirmation of the Commissioners' high hopes for the spiritual edification of the \\"poore natives\\" of the New Haven, Connecticut area.<br />There is another letter accompanying the first one, from John Eliot, the \\"Apostle to the Indians.\\" A native of Roxbury, very near to Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, Eliot is chiefly remembered today for having translated the entire bible into Massachusett, the dialect indigenous to Eastern Massachusetts and the surrounding region. His letter isn't explicitly about Abraham Pierson's catechism. Rather, it is a broader appeal to the Board of Directors of the New England Company, asking them to support the drive to translate materials for religious instruction into the local dialects.<br />After Eliot's letter, several pages are missing. If it is known what was once contained in those pages, I am unaware of that knowledge. I have not been able to come up with anything useful about the missing pages, although that doesn't necessarily mean that someone out there hasn't done a thesis on it at some point.<br />The boolet resumes at page 24, with a few short paragraphs by Abraham Pierson. These words are addressed not to the Quinnipiac people, but to English readers. He makes several points about pronunciation, accent, and grammar. This section is very short, but it still has value to students of this topic.<br />The catechism itself is only ten pages long, including the title page. It could be of interest to a student of Algonquian linguistics, or to someone with an interest in early English religions in America. I myself came to this text as part of a hobby, which is learning what I can about the early tongues spoken in New England. I noticed that this text has a lot in common with Massachusett, but with some differences. I understand the natives of local tribes could communicate, but from eastern Massachusetts to New Haven was starting to push it a little... Watch for the word \\"mandoo,\\" a local variation of the better-known \\"manitou,\\" referring to God, or to more general supernatural power. This appears very similar to the old Mohegan Pequot term \\"mandu.\\" Iam not qualified to comment too much beyond this, although I tentatively have noted a few other points. Keep an eye out for things like the use of \\"qua\\" for \\"and,\\" instead of Massachusett \\"kah.\\" \\"Matta\\" is exactly the same, as the word for \\"not\\" in both dialects. The words for \\"light\\" seem to differ slightly, being \\"wequai\\" in Massachusett, but \\"wequai-ai\\" in Quripi-Unquachog. This is just a hobby for me, I'm still learning. Anyway, if you want to try to make this your own hobby, look for John Eliot's \\"Indian Primer,\\" which cotains a small catechism in Massachusett. You can find some of your own points of comparison. Also, you need to know about the Smithsonian's \\"Handbook of North American Indians,\\" volume 15, pages 70-77. This contains a great article that places Quiripi-Unquachog in linguistic context, and also has a helpful chart of phonetic relationships between this tongue and related Algonquian dialects.<br />After the catechism, there is a postscript writtenby Charles Chauncy, the contemporary president of Harvard College. He makes the point that some \\"indians\\" had already proven to be apt students of the printed word, and that he had great hopes for their \\"perfectibility.\\"<br />Make sure you also check out the article I mentioned in the Smithsonian \\"handbook\\" (which is really a huge set of encyclopedias, taking up an entire bookshelf). Also, see the lists and guides I've placed on my reviewer's page, for some further suggestions related to this fascinating topic.	2002-10-24
US	52797729	R3G31ITM0ARG85	0781240131	843608362	Bibliography Of The Algonquian Languages (Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletins)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Old, but Indispensable	This book was first published in 1891. However, the vast majority of primary source materials, in many Algonquian languages, had already been written down by that time. Therefore, this work still has a lot of relevance, to anyone interested in studying this fascinating subject.<br />Please note, incidentally, that this is a bibliography of \\"Algonquian\\" languages, as opposed to \\"Algic.\\"  The latter term was devised as an umbrella designation, to allow the inclusion of the northwestern Californian native tongues known as Yurok and Wiyot.  These languages are now known to be distantly related to the eastern Algonquian languages, but no such relationship was yet established in 1891, when Pilling's book was compiled.  Therefore, don't look here for materials having to do with Yurok or Wiyot.<br />The Pilling bibliography includes information on finding articles and records in old state historical society records, from various states.  For this reason, among others, it still has a lot of value.  If you would like to seek out more recently compiled resources, you could try \\"Bibliography of Algonquian Linguistics,\\" published in 1982, by David Pentland and H.C. Wolfart.  Or, for still more recent resources, ask your local librarian to help you seek out the 2003 issues of the newsletter \\"Algonquian and Iroquoian Linguistics,\\" ISSN 0711-382X, edited by John D. Nichols of the Department of American Indian Studies, at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.  Finally, you may wish to be aware of the work archived on the (non-profit) website [...]  If you go to that website, look on the horizontal bar across the top of the main page.  Click on \\"Mailing Lists,\\" which is near the right hand side of the bar.  When you get to the page entitled \\"Welcome to the Mailing Lists Area,\\" click on the first option, \\"Browse Mailing Lists Archived on the LINGUIST Site. \\"  The third archived list is called ALGONQDICT.  Click on the red title of the list, then look down near the bottom of thepage.  You will be able to browse through listserv archives from October, 2003, to the present.  If you look for the e-mail addresses of the list subscribers, they are famously helpful and friendly to anyone with an interest in this little-known topic.<br />To business...  there are 2,245 titled entries in the Pilling book. Of these, 1,926 relate to printed books and articles. 319 have to do with what were unpublished manuscripts, at the time that this book first came out. I would like to point out here that many of these \\"unpublished\\" entries can be located today. You may need to use your imagination, and try a few different spellings of Algonquian words in the titles you seek. But ask your local librarian to help you use OCLC/Worldcat to hunt around on the internet. You'll be surprised at what you might turn up in old archives, etc.<br />Entries vary quite a bit in content, and in length. For example, the entry for John Eliot, (the seventeenth century \\"Apostle to the Indians,\\" and translator of the bible into Massachusett), is a full fifty-seven pages long. This totally eclipses the number of pages of all other scholars. For example, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft warranted ten pages of entries, and the great James Hammond Trumbull only has seven pages devoted to his work. Other entries are much tinier. Pilling made up all kinds of oddball categories, as a matter of fact. Again, you will probably benefit from using your imagination, in concocting topics to search for.<br />Entries are alphabetically arranged, all in a single alphabetic sequence. There are not separate sequences for subjects, authors, or titles. No siree. Therefore, for example, under \\"G,\\" you will find entries for papers authored by people with the last name \\"Gordon,\\" followed by entries concerning the gospels, followed by an entry on grammars in various tongues. \\"G\\" also contains entries on the Gros Ventre tribe, and, of course, many individual authors. Oftentimes, the word \\"author\\" really means \\"translator,\\" if you want to be precise.<br />Entries typically give an author's name, the work's title, some publishers' information, a quick description of the contents, and often a few paragraphs about the significance of the work, or the author/translator. Finally, mention is made of whether James Pilling or one of his associates actually had seen the volume in question, (which is the case 95% of the time). Again, this information is often enough to dig up copies today, using OCLC/Worldcat.<br />One additional useful feature is the chronologic index, on pages 577-614. This index places the entire contents of the book in chronological order, item by item. This can help to draw attention to relationships between entries that you might otherwise not have perceived. This can be particularly useful for the earlier entries, when the number of tribes communicating with whites was relatively slight.<br />I myself have used this book to track down materials pertaining to the old native tongues of New England. I can tell you, it has called my attention to quite a few items that I would never have known existed, without this fine resource. Whatever your particular Algonquian linguistic interest might be, I think this book can probably be a lot of help to you. Therefore, I hereby recommend the living daylights out of \\"Bibliography Of The Algonquian Languages\\" (Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletins)<BR>by James Constantine Pilling.	2002-10-24
US	52797729	R1IMWY7W0M3AHD	019869119X	645987013	English River Names (Oxford Reprints)	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Surprisingly Interesting	This fascinating volume focuses entirely upon the etymology of the names of the rivers of Great Britain.  Hundreds of \\"rivers\\" are covered, ranging from the Thames to myriads of obscure, tiny creeks.  Etymologies frequently go back in time to before the Anglo-Saxons invaded Britain, to the era when river names were virtually all of Celtic derivation.<br />Be sure to spend some time on the introduction.  It's seventy pages long, and includes careful, helpful discussions of relevant topics.  Some of these topics are 1.) place names derived from river names, 2.)ancient river names which have disappeared, 3.)discussion of grammatical and orthographic issues, and many other useful topics.  The book is arranged alphabetically, although sometimes the entry you seek might be placed under an alternate spelling.  If there is any question at all about the spelling of a river's name, there will always at least be a note in places where you might look, directing you to where the entry is actually written up.<br />You might wonder why someone would review a book like this on the American Amazon.com, as opposed to its British sister corporation's website.  Well, I sought this book out because I am interested in the etymologies of the names of towns in my native Massachusetts.  You might be surprised at how many old British river names have been incoporated into the names of our American towns.  For example, any town having a name that ends in \\"-mouth,\\" has a beginning that is, or once was, the name of a river.  In Massachusetts, we have Yarmouth, Falmouth, Plymouth, Dartmouth, and Weymouth.  All of these towns were named after old English towns.  In turn, these towns were thus named because they lay at the mouths of local English rivers, named Yar, Fal, Plym, Dart, and Wey.<br />This book adds a certain magic to my daily life, just knowing that the towns I sometimes pass through carry ancient words within their names.  If you'd like to see if the kind of information in this book might interest you, please spend time on this paragraph...  For example, the river Yar was first mentioned by the ancient Greek geographer Ptolemy, in the second century A.D.  The word is believed to stem from an old, pre-English, Celtic word \\"gar,\\" meaning something like \\"shout\\" or \\"cry,\\" and probably referring to the loud sounds made by rushing water at the Yar's mouth, when tides were changing.  The word Fal is also an old Celtic word, once meaning either \\"whirlpool\\" or \\"prince.\\"  Eilert Ekwall, the author of this book, guides the reader through the arguments which have been adduced, by scholars, to support either of those meanings.  The English river Plym seems to have been named in English-speaking times, since the 5th century A.D., and simply refers to a local town in which plum trees were plentiful.  The river Dart bears an intriguing name, meaning \\"oak,\\" and etymologically connected to the old Celtic word \\"druid.\\"   <br />The river Wey, according to Ekwall, probably derives its name from an old Celtic word \\"ueis,\\" meaning \\"water.\\"  In another branch of that old word's growth, it developed into the Irish word uisge, which gave us our word \\"whiskey.\\"  Yes, I'm serious!<BR>I was mildly non-plussed to see that Ekwall omitted mention of a small controversy about the name of the river Wey.  Some believe that this river-name goes back to pre-Celtic days, which to my overheated imagination immediately implies a possible connection, (perhaps the only surviving linguistic connection) to the pre-Celtic builders of Stonehenge.  If anyone would like to read more about this, try \\"English Place Names,\\" by Kenneth Cameron.<br />Is anyone out there is dying to read about whether the name of England's most famous river, the Thames, has an interesting tale behind it?  Well, Ekwall explains to us that it is believed to derive from an age-old Indo-European word, meaning \\"dark river.\\" This may also be the ultimate source of the name of one of the tributaries of the Ganges in India, which is known as the Tamasa.<br />This book is not for everyone, but if you enjoy this kind of thing it can become quite addictive.  Let me once again recommend \\"English Place Names,\\" by Kenneth Cameron, for related reading.  Also, unless you have a real background in this general topic, you might have a rough time keeping the names of all the little ancient dialects and languages straight.  With this in mind, you really might want to pick up a copy of \\"Languages in Britain & Ireland,\\" by Glanville Price.  It will help you have a lot more appreciation for this interesting book.	2002-10-19

First, let me post a brief warning so you know what this book is NOT.<br />I am kind of an &quot;absent-minded professor&quot; type of guy.  I assumed that this book was intended to help someone like me get to be a little more &quot;centered,&quot; calm, and inwardly focused, in order to be better prepared for a relationship with the next lady in my life.  Please take note: that isn't exactly the aim of this book.  The book begins with the assumption that you are ALREADY in a relationship, and that you wish to improve it.  The exercises are geared toward couples, and often make no sense to attempt alone.  Therefore, technically, I wasted my money.  However, I still think this could be a pretty useful book to me, someday.  For you, perhaps that day is already here.<br />&quot;Centering and the Art of Intimacy&quot; is laid out in two parts.  The first part, &quot;A New Psychology of Close Relationships,&quot; attempts to shake up the way you think about relationships.  It consists of a few helpful essays, which provide real life examples and metaphors to help you conceptualize the paradigm the authors wish to explore with you.  This part of the book ends with the authors discussing their own relationship, and the ways in which the act of commiting themselves to productive change had a positive impact on their relationship.  I liked that chapter, it's pretty inspiring to read.<br />The second part of the book is longer, more comprehensive, and more interactive.  It includes exercises of all kinds, designed to get you to take stock of who you are, what you and your partner want, where you want to be, and how you might get there.  As I said, the book is extremely interactive, with at least 10 or 12 activities and worksheets.  Readers are encouraged in various ways to keep a journal, to help foment thought about the changes they seek to make.  Some of these exercises can, perhaps, occasionally get a little too &quot;New Age&quot; for some people, but there is a wide range to explore.  You can probably find a few things that you could benefit from.<br />Basically, this book could be pretty useful to a couple already in a relationship.  If you appreciate, enjoy, and/or value the approaches taken in this book, I would like to recommend that you seek out &quot;Games People Play,&quot; the classic text of transactional analysis, by Dr. Eric Berne.<br />Enjoy, and good luck!!haps, occasionally get a little too &quot;New Age&quot; for some people, but there is a wide range to explore.

US	52797729	R337NVBN98DVBL	0316125407	122665065	The Wonderful Flight to the Mushroom Planet	Books	5	23	24	N	N	A true classic	David and Chuck are just a couple of regular, ordinary, everyday kids, with a regular, ordinary, everyday chicken, named Mrs. Pennyfeather.  One day they happen to answer a regular, ordinary, everyday newspaper ad.  Suddenly they find themselves blasting off in a tiny spaceship, headed for a tiny planet that a local astronomer has just discovered!  Before they know it, they are on a mission to save the tiny Mushroom Planet from a terrible fate.  All they have to depend upon are their wits, the astronomer's mysterious advice, their own love of science -- and their regular, ordinary, everyday chicken, Mrs. Pennyfeather.  What will become of them?  What will become of the chicken?  What will become of the inhabitants of the little planet, the Mushroom People?<br />I remember first reading this story, in about third grade.  Eleanor Cameron makes the story so interesting, and so fun, I didn't even want to go to sleep until I had finished the book.  After I finished it, I couldn't decide which was more interesting to me: reading, or doing science.  Just remember -- if the kids didn't know their science, the story wouldn't have a happy ending!  That's all I'll say here.  I don't want to spoil the book for anyone.<br />This happens to be a really good time to be reading this neat little book.  Did you know that real astronomers recently discovered something new in our solar system?  They can't decide if they should call it a planet or not.  Would you like to learn more about it?  See if you can use the Internet to learn about the word \\"Quaoar,\\" which is what astronomers are calling the object.  Or, you could ask your science teacher about it.  Who knows -- maybe we'll even find some mutant mushrooms up there, someday!<br />I would like to recommend another astronomy book that I loved in third grade.  It's called \\"Powers of Ten,\\" by Philip Morrison.  I haven't been in third grade for quite awhile, but I STILL love that book.  Please take 2 minutes and see if you can find iton Amazon.com -- I bet you'll love it.<br />Anyway -- \\"The Wonderful Flight to the Mushroom Planet\\" is amazing.  Two thumbs up!	2002-10-13
US	52797729	R3MMQ7ZGG14XDK	0380003198	414825953	No Blade of Grass	Books	3	19	28	N	N	Interesting, but doesn't promote a helpful frame of mind	The basic idea of this young adult story is really interesting.  A mutant virus has appeared, but it only affects certain plants, not humans or animals.  \\"Well, that doesn't sound so bad,\\" you say?  Wrong!  The virus destroys all grasses and grains.  This not only means brown lawns in the suburbs, but also leads to a total lack of food for cattle and other livestock.  Furthermore, it entails a similarly utter lack of wheat and grain, for humans.  Within a year, terrible famine spreads throughout the world.  Civilization collapses.  The few scared, skinny survivors who remain huddle together in isolated valleys, growing rare virus-resistant potatos for food, and fighting off bands of marauding scavengers.<br />The premise of this story is really intriguing and provocative.  However, as usual, John Christopher is too preoccupied with creating extremely brutal, murderous, unnecessarily tough-guy characters.  He did this in the Tripod Trilogy, he did it in \\"The Long Winter,\\" and he does it again here.  I personally think that characters like this seem to take up residence in a reader's unconscious mind.  For literally years to come, they can provide a feeling of justification for all kinds of mean, evil behavior.  Why not write about people who make things work out?  Why not focus on the good?  Or at least, why not write about the scientific elements of this virus, and a scientific struggle to cure it?<br />If you'd like to read some nonfiction about this kind of scenario, I'd like to recommend \\"Catastrophe: An Investigation into the Origins of Modern Civilization,\\" by David Keys.  That book is about similarly widespread famines, and struggles which the author believes may have taken place during the medieval period.  Or, you might wish to read \\"The New Nuclear Danger,\\" by Dr. Helen Caldicott.  Anyway, \\"No Blade of Grass\\" is interesting in a way, but it has too much negativity.  One thumb partly up.	2002-10-13
US	52797729	R2Z7ERE55Q50YX	0936548134	94406096	World Refugee Survey 2002: An Annual Assessment to Conditions Affecting Refugees, Asylum Seekers, and Internally Displaced Persons	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A User-Friendly, Intelligently Compiled Resource	The &quot;World Refugee Survey: 2002&quot; is the latest edition of a fine, yearly publication, which strives mightily to assist readers in making sense of the tremendously complex world of refugee-related issues.  Please note that this is not a UNHCR publication, but is published under the auspices of the U.S. Committee for Refugees.<br />Every year for the past ten or fifteen years, there have been somewhere in the neighborhood of fifteen million refugees worldwide, plus or minus two or three million.  The events of the past year in Afghanistan might be expected to have produced a giant increase in this total, but in fact it produced what was merely a blip on the statistical radar.  This excellent publication helps the reader to understand the diverse range of refugees, and refugee-related issues, worldwide.<br />The book is divided into four main parts.  First, there is a collection of statistical tables and charts, to provide a graphic sense of the figures involved.  All the tables and charts are in color, and are both user-friendly and well designed.  No complex statistical mathematics are involved.  There is also a map of worldwide refugee situations tucked into this section.  In an improvement upon earlier editions, the map is folded in such a manner that it is not possible to miss it.  The tables are as follows:<BR>1.)Major Displacement and Returns During 2001, by Country<BR>2.)Refugees and Asylum Seekers During 2001, by Country<BR>3.)Refugees and Asylum Seekers Worldwide, from 1993 to 2001<BR>4.)Principal Sources of Refugees<BR>5.)Principal Sources of Internally Displaced Persons<BR>6.)Top Twenty Donor Countries to Refugee Aid Agencies, in Terms of U.S. Dollars Per Capita Population<BR>7.)Top Twenty Donor Countries to Refugee Aid Agencies, in Terms of Millions of U.S. Dollars<BR>8.)Ratio of Refugees to Selected Host-Country Populations<BR>9.)People in Refugee-Like Situations<BR>10.)Asylum Applicants in Selected Countries, 1992 to 2001<BR>11.)Significant Voluntary Repatriations<BR>12.)Involuntary Returns and Expulsions<br />The second part of the book is comprised of a collection of articles.  Make sure to read the &quot;The Year in Review&quot; article.  It will greatly aid you in making sense of the book as a whole.  Other article include the inspiring &quot;A Survivor Speaks for Those Who Fell by the Roadside;&quot;  &quot;Everything Has Changed,&quot; which title refers to the post September 11 world refugee paradigms; &quot;Rethinking U.S. Refugee Admissions Quantity and Quality;&quot;  &quot;Refugee Law is Not Immigration Law;&quot;  and &quot;Refugee Law in South Africa: Making the Road of the Refugee Longer?&quot;  As you can see, some articles are broad-ranging, dealing with overarching issues in international law.  Others pertain to particular geographical crisis areas.<br />The third section of this volume is comprised of &quot;Country Reports,&quot; which are pithy, well-organized, carefully broken-down discussions of some of the outstanding refugee issues faced by various sovereign nations.  The Country Reports are broken up by continent, or sometimes by region (Oceania, Middle East).  The Reports include commentary on many issues.  Some examples of these issues include 1.)legal procedures for processing asylum applicants in various host countries; 2.)interal displacement of peoples, within national borders, famously including the Kurds, but also including Afghanistan, the Congo, etc.; 3.)attitudes of local taxpayers and voters, toward asylum-seekers.  There are many other issues discussed in these reports.  Each Country Report is &quot;personalized,&quot; so to speak.  There is no set, standardized formula for the presenattion of all the countries discussed.  Each report is tailored, and written in such a way as to emphasize the preeminent concerns of the region in question.<br />The fourth and final section of this book is the Directory.  This may be the most helpful part of the book, for many readers, if they wish to become proactive about their interest in refugee issues.  The Directory includes single paragraph entries on several dozen international, governmental, and private refugee relief organizations.  There are also entries for various organizations which provide or package information about refugees worldwide.<br />For further research, there is a small, somewhat cursorily compiled bibliography on page 290.  This bibliography sometimes has preety incomplete information about sources, for some reason, but it's better than nothing!  I have wondered if there was kind of editorial oversight involved with this bibliography, because it is not only incomplete, but not even mentioned in the table of contents.  So if you're interested, I'm just mentioning it here, so you'll know it exists.  Incidentally, if editorial error took place in this case, that error was highly unusual, possibly unique, in this excellent reference work.<br />This book is very useful.  I would recommend this for any library, or for private citizens who would like to be citizens of the world.  I would also like to mention here that, whoever you are, if you use a search engine to find the website of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, (UNHCR), you will find a lot of helpful information there as well.<br />A terrific reference work.  Two thumbs up.	2002-09-21

Bush's Military-Industrial Complex	Books	5	55	64	N	N	The Most Important Book in the English Language	Amazon.com has an inventory of over two million books.  If I had to choose the single most important book, the one book I would recommend to ANYONE, I would say that this is it.<br />Dr. Helen Caldicott is an Australian pediatrician and human survival activist.  She is frequently on the short list of nominees for the Nobel Peace Prize.  As of the day I'm  writing this, she hasn't quite won it yet.  I personally think it's just a matter of time before she does.<br />Would you say that you have a really rock-solid, thorough, complete understanding of the nuclear threat in today's world?  Probably not.  The topic has had a far lower profile than it once did, since the end of the Cold War.  Well, don't you think you ought to consider updating your understanding?  This book is user-friendly, it's timely, and it's EXTREMELY informative.<br />You should buy this book for Chapter Two alone.  When's the last time you read anything about nuclear winter, written by someone who actually knows what they're talking about?  Don't you think you should be well-informed about the topic?  How about accidental nuclear war?  Did you know we came within less than 3 minutes of a major, accidental exchange of nuclear missiles, on January 29, 1995?  How good an understanding of fallout do you really have?  What about its specific medical consequences?  As a voter and a taxpayer, don't you think you owe it to yourself, to your children, and to ME (and all the rest of humanity, obviously) to be as well-informed about these topics as possible?!<br />The bulk of this book is devoted to discussing the often incestuous relationships between major defense contractors and our national government.  Dr. Caldicott illuminatingly describes how nuclear policy can be not only influenced, but actually formed, directed, and driven by the extremely well-funded corporate forces of our arms establishment.  She makes a number of excellent points about the dangers inherent in this situation.  I will let you discover her brilliant observations for yourself.<br />Even if you don't expect to agree with her views, you should at least hear Dr. Caldicott out.  If you disagree with her, that's your right, but at least listen to what she has to say.  In a totally non-partisan spirit, she also provides four helpful appendices, which I imagine people of any political stripe would find to be informative and helpful.  These appendices include A.)Major U.S. Nuclear-Weapons Makers; B.)U.S. Nuclear-Weapons Control Centers and Government Authorities; C.)Locations of the Majority of Usable U.S. Nuclear Weapons; and D.)Major Antinuclear Organizations in the United States, Great Britain, and Russia.<br />If you value being informed about matters of life and death, I recommend that you also seek out \\"The Cold and the Dark: The World After Nuclear War,\\" by Carl Sagan and Paul Ehrlich.  Another user-friendly, informative book, which assumes no prior knowledge or scientific background, is \\"Planet Earth in Jeopardy: Environmental Consequences of Nuclear War,\\" by Lydia Dotto.  <br />But again, the most important book on the topic, and the one I hope you ask all your friends, family and neighbors to read, is \\"The New Nuclear Danger: George W. Bush's Military-Industrial Complex,\\" by Dr. Helen Caldicott.  Please buy it, and above all, please try to understand what Dr. Caldicott has to say to us all.	2002-09-21

Ronald Fritze has made a study of old legends, from China, Europe, Africa, and the Islamic world, of possible visitors to the shores of America before Columbus. Not only legends are included -- he has also written about the theories of Barry Fell, which are based upon supposed epigraphic evidence, and also many tales which are articles of faith to followers of the Mormon faith. While most of these old tales can probably never be proven scientifically, it is certainly pleasant to experience a sense of wonder about the legends, and to ask \\"what if\\" some of these putative expeditions, if they ever took place, had met with greater success...<br />There are 216 alphabetically arranged entries in this encyclopedic volume. Entries range from 50 words to several pages in length. The volume is NOT divided up into sub-categories such as authors, explorers, quasi-mythical geographic locales, etc. Instead, they are all alphabetized together, in a single, book-long sequence. Most entries include a small bibliography for further reading. Also, there is a complete bibliography at the end, including approximately 300 books and articles. <br />There are maps of the world inside both front and back covers, showing relevant ocean currents as well as continents, etc. There are also illustrations and photos. These include line drawings of various ships, a photo of Thor Heyerdahl, photographs of various provocative artifacts, reproductions of old prints and lithographs, etc.<br />One of my favorite entries is the one about Chinese expeditions to \\"Fusang,\\" which may be what early Buddhist explorers called America. The story of Madoc, the disenfranchised Welsh prince who may have sailed to our shores in 1170 A.D., is also captivating. There are articles about Abu-Bakari of Mali, who may have landed in Central America in the 14th century; Muslim sailors who sailed to a place across the Atlantic which they called\\"Mu-Lan-Pi;\\" and Henry Sinclair of the Orkney Islands, who some believe may have sailed to Newfoundland in 1398. There are dozens and dozens of stories like this, and reading this book can become as addictive as eating an extra-large bag of good popcorn at a movie.<br />The entries are not merely descriptive, but also, very cautiously, evaluative. Fritze is generally quite hard-headed in his assessments of all these legends. I guesstimate that he dismisses at least three quarters of these stories as being wholly unfounded. Personally, I have to admit that he's probably on target in that assessment. The stories are incredibly interesting, nevertheless, and can really get you imagination working. I'd recommend this book to anyone with a healthy sense of wonder, from age 9 and up. Definitely two thumbs up.<br />If you enjoy this kind of thing, I would like to make some recommendations. \\"Phantom Islands of the Atlantic: The Legends of Seven Lands That Never Were,\\" by Donald S. Johnson, is really good. \\"Quest for America,\\" by Geoffrey Ashe, is out of print, but if you can ask your local librarian to help you find a copy, it's a lot of fun. The January, 2000 issue of the \\"Atlantic Monthly\\" has a really neat article on the subject, written by Marc Stengel, and entitled \\"The Diffusionists Have Landed.\\" Finally, you need to know about the monumental two-volume set \\"Pre-Columbian Contact With the Americas Across the Oceans: An<BR> Annotated Bibliography,\\" by John L. Sorenson, and Martin H. Raish.	2002-09-21
US	52797729	RV8XKY0GGNBRF	0671745077	864816767	Monster	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Scarifying story!	This story is not relaxing at all.  Angela, the main character, thinks her friend Mary is crazy -- at first.  Mary has gone nuts, apparently, and done some really violent, awful things.  Mary even thinks that some of the kids in school are turning into monsters.  But the more Angela learns, the more she thinks that her town is being taken over by extraterrestrial vampires.  People are being transformed into vampires because of an ancient virus from outer space.  The virus has been hidden deep beneath a lake, in a crater, which was formed when a small asteroid struck the Earth thousands of years ago.  Suddenly, it seems like the virus has gotten into the water, and people are drinking it!  Worst of all...  Angela herself may be turning into a space vampire.  Aaaahhhh!<br />This story has two main ingredients.  Vampires, and asteroids hitting the earth.  If you would like to read a good, nonfiction book that's all about the legend of vampires, I recommend that you read \\"In Search of Dracula: The History of Dracula and Vampires,\\" by Raymond T. McNally, and Radu R. Florescu.  That's a really neat book, and it will give you a chance to learn some real history, too.  If you're scared of asteroids, (which makes a lot more sense than being scared of vampires!!!)  I think you might like to read \\"Impact!: The Threat of Comets and Asteroids,\\" by a real live astronomer named Gerrit Verschuur.<br />Anyway, this is a pretty spooky book.  If you like scary stories, but don't read very much, or if you know someone who's just getting started reading on their own, I think this book would be perfect.  Two thumbs up!	2002-09-15
US	52797729	R1U23WHYW60OL4	0786407999	584538653	The Indians of the Nipmuck Country in Southern New England, 1630-1750: An Historical Geography	Books	5	19	19	N	N	Much better than other works on the topic	This book is a terrific example of local history, and a highly sensitive examination of Native American issues in 17th and 18th century New England.  Readers of this text will learn virtually all there is to know about the scantily-documented Nipmuck tribes of central Massachusetts, and the adjacent corners of Connecticut and Rhode Island.<br />I would like to point out, to prospective readers, that most New England tribes, especially in this time frame, are often viewed through the prism of the wars of the era.  These wars most prominently include the Pequot war of the 1630s, and King Phillip's War of the 1670s.  You might want to prepare for this book, by getting some kind of an overview of these wars.  At least take an hour to read about them in an encyclopedia, or online.  This book does not assume any prior knowledge on the part of the reader, but you will get more out of it if you prepare yourself in this manner.  You may also want to pick up a road map of Massachusetts, or (better) New England.  The maps included here are hand-drawn, and, while adequate, do not necessarily provide quite as full a sense of geographical context as one might get from a good road map.<br />Most of the information about social structure, food sources, and ways of life are covered in the first chapter.  I would have liked to see some more about this, but the fact is that Dennis Connole has completely exhausted all the information about this topic.  There are plenty of more general books about this topic, notably &quot;Handbook of North American Indians: Northeast, Vol.15,&quot; published by the Smithsonian Institution, and edited by William C. Sturtevant.<br />A lot of this book focuses on issues of land ownership, and the significance of these questions to Nipmuck tribal life.  In my opinion, the most fascinating chapter is Chapter Eight, about a Nipmuck named John Wampus, given an elite education, from a young age, by upper-crust Puritans in Boston.  He eventually became caught up in some land-related struggles between the Nipmucks and the Massachusetts Bay Company officials.  It's amazing to see the struggles he went through while trying to juggle traditional Nipmuck ideas about land, with the English ideas he picked up in school.  He eventually argued some issues before the Lords of the Kings Council, in London, and died thousands of miles from his Central Massachusetts home.<br />Another interesting anecdote to watch for is in Chapter Thirteen.  Apparently, some Nipmucks were actually sold into slavery in Africa, and survived for at least seven or eight years in Tangier.  Eventually they got word to the Puritan &quot;apostle to the indians,&quot; John Eliot, about their situation, and requested that he intercede on their behalf.  We do not learn the ending of this amazing tale.   I can't help but feel for these poor folks, who grew up right where I did, serving out a terrible term of servitude under a megalomanical sultan in Morocco.  I'm glad that Dennis Connole lets us know of their plight, even if it is 300 years too late to help.<br />Other interesting parts are in later chapters, when we learn of Nipmucs who essentially became refugees after King Phillips War.  Some moved to Connecticut, some to Pennsylvania, and some to Schaghticoke in New York.  Interestingly, the descendants of some of these Nipmucks are still part of a native American community in Quebec, -- the St. Francis indians (or St. Francois) of Odanak, Quebec, near Montreal.<br />I think this book is pretty terrific.  Dennis Connole fills a real gap in the literature, in descibing for us the lives of these people.  If you'd like to learn more about the Nipmucks, try using your internet skills to see what comes up, if you run a search on the word &quot;Hassanamisco,&quot; &quot;Nipmuck,&quot; or, alternately, &quot;Nipmuc.&quot;  An all-around great book.  Two thumbs up!	2002-09-15
US	52797729	R26SR0NKW8ZIO9	0060931396	313139072	Alas, Babylon (Perennial Classics)	Books	3	13	22	N	N	Hard-hitting, but Incredibly Outdated	In \\"Alas, Babylon,\\" Pat Frank has created what was once considered a highly realistic vision of rural America, as seen after a major nuclear war.  At least he tried to get people thinking about this \\"unthinkable\\" topic, which makes him a better human being than most of us.  However, readers today really need to think about how dated this story actually is.<br />The basic tale is of a small town in rural Florida, and how it is transformed by the sudden obliteration of our national economy.  Due to a combination of wind patterns, geography, and unbelievable good fortune, radiation is hardly even an issue to the denizens of the lucky town.  The only people who suffer radiation illness are those who foolishly venture too close to the cratered ruins of various vaporized cities.  Because radiation is not a significant problem, this book should best be considered to be a study of how folks might cope in the event of an unprecedented Depression, with the added factors of total, permanent cessation of public utilities; decaying roads; and the advent of lawless behavior on a scale unseen since the days of the wild west.<br />The main character is a man named Randy Bragg, who is getting close to early middle age.  He learns of the impending war by way of a telegram, from a brother in the armed forces.  The telegram simply reads \\"Alas, Babylon,\\" which to the biblically literate brothers is a pre-arranged sign, a signal that a major nuclear war is almost definitely on the way.  He heroically starts trying to take precautions for his loved ones, by stocking up on supplies, but tragically lacks the foresight to understand that most of his supplies will be unable to be preserved, without electricity.  As the story unfolds, we encounter further unpleasant, unforeseen situations -- no running water; no toilets; no way to keep insulin cooled, for diabetics; no smallpox vaccines; no spare food for dogs, or other ways to keep them from becoming feral; when a pair of glasses is broken, there's no way to get a new pair... the list goes on and on.  Eventually, this story shows its stripes as a product of the 1950s, and develops a plot that could have been tailor-made for John Wayne.  A group of highway brigands starts spreading havoc, and Randy Bragg and his fearless cohorts must stage an ambush.  This plotline gives much of the feeling of a \\"story\\" to this sequence of events.<br />Although I salute Pat Frank for writing this book, I give it three stars only because it is hopelessly outdated for todays reader.  I myself am no expert in nuclear war, but even I can see at least three or four major problems with this book.  NONE of the problems are Pat Frank's fault in ANY way.  They simply concern developments, in scientific understanding of nuclear war scenarios, that have come about since the 1950s, when this book was written.  For example, how about the Electro-Magnetic Pulse, or EMP?  In the 1950s, no one understood that a single large nuclear bomb, if detonated two to three hundred miles above the United States, would generate an electro-magnetic pulse which would turn every computer, every database, every electronic appliance in the country into junk.  This event alone would destroy our economy - no electronic credit records would survive, no banking or medical records on databases, etc.<br />Or how about nuclear winter?  No one in the 1950s knew anything about the topic.  It hadn't been considered by scientists.  What about increased ultraviolet radiation, from damage to the ozone layer?  What about chemical changes in our very atmosphere, caused by toxic clouds from burning cities?  Finally, I really have to take issue with the near-total lack of attention paid to radiation in this book.  In a major conflict, it would be soooo much worse than this book implies.<br />If you'd like some better, more updated information about nuclear war, try reading Nobel Peace Prize nominee Dr. Helen Caldicott's \\"The New Nuclear Danger.\\"  It just came out a fewmonths ago.  For a book about nuclear winter, try reading \\"The Cold and the Dark: The World After Nuclear War,\\" by Carl Sagan and Paul Ehrlich.  If you'd just like to read some realistic, modern fiction about life after a nuclear conflict, try reading \\"Warday: And the Journey Onward,\\" by Whitley Streiber and James Kunetka, which was highly praised by U.S. Senators of both political parties, when it came out in 1984.  Finally, I would like to urge you in the strongest possible terms to seek out a copy of the video \\"Threads.\\"  \\"Threads\\" is an old BBC made-for-television docudrama, released in 1984, about the effects on an average little town of a nuclear war.  You can usually find it on a major online auction house, by entering the terms \\"threads\\" and \\"war\\" in the search field.<br />Anyway, \\"Alas, Babylon\\" in ridiculously outdated, but at least it might start someone thinking.  One tentative thumb up.	2002-09-15
US	52797729	R31V6S1N0FPHW8	1889758027	935398395	A Vocabulary of Mohegan-Pequot (American Language Reprints) (English and Algonquian Languages Edition)	Books	5	16	16	N	N	Helpful and interesting	This interesting dictionary was compiled almost entirely from the diaries of the last speaker of Mohegan Pequot, a Mohegan woman named Fidelia Fielding, who passed away in 1908.  It's quite short -- only 42 pages of vocabulary, with approximately ten words per page.  The main dictionary is followed by a single page of vocabulary from the \\"Brothertown Mohegans\\" of Wisconsin, who moved to Wisconsin in the 1800s.  <br />For anyone who doesn't know this, let me just explicitly note right here that the Mohegans are completely different from the Mohicans.  To help you keep things straight, the word \\"Mohegan\\" is basically ALWAYS spelled the same way.  Any time you see a spelling like Mohican, Mochican, Mahican, or...Muhhekaneew, those words refer to a totally, absolutely, completely separate tribe, which formerly lived in western Connecticut, western Massachusetts, and also in New York.  That tribe is also sometimes called the Stockbridge Indians.  Confusingly enough, like the Brothertown Mohegans, the Mohicans/Mahicans/Mochicans/Muhhekaneew/Stockbridge indians now live in Wisconsin, but they are still distinct from Wisconsin's Brothertown Mohegans.  Are you baffled?  Bemused?  Befogged and bewildered?  Well, welcome to the club.<br />I felt that the above note would be useful here, to straighten things out a little, or at least to acknowledge that a certain amount of confusion on this topic is far from being uncommon, or even inappropriate.  <br />Back to the dictionary itself -- there is a handy little reverse dictionary in back, translating words from English to Mohegan.  There is a short table of numerals, as well, going from one (nequt) to 29 (nobnenebozukukwong).  Remember, this dictionary is best used in conjunction with the writings of Fidelia Fielding.  That diary is available in the 43rd Annual Report of the \\"Bureau of American Ethnology,\\" published for the years 1925-1926.  The article is straightforwardly entitled \\"Mohegan Pequot Diary,\\" and is an intriguing mixture of a.)mundane comments on the weather, and b.)fascinating religious musings.  The religious musings are intriguing because they embody an amazing, syncretic amalgam of Christianity and native conceptualizations of supernatural manitou, spelled \\"mandu\\" in Mohegan...  For further source materials, you may want to have a look at the periodical \\"American Anthropologist,\\" volume 5, pp.193-212.<br />The so-called \\"modern\\" Mohegan tongue, currently being revitalized by the tribe, will have a few small differences when work is completed, simply due to a lack of hard data to work with.  It's still BASED on this vocabulary, however, so the book will always have some merit in that regard.<br />This vocabulary is also intended, in part, as a supplement to James Hammond Trumbull's \\"Natick Dictionary,\\" which is also available from this online bookstore.  \\"Natick Dictionary\\" is referred to frequently here, in definitions, for Algonquian cognates.<br />I looked carefully through this vocabulary for words which may have been borrowed by English.  This can be a fun way to spend an hour.  \\"Caucus,\\" for example, is often believed to have come from a New England dialect of Algonquian, although I couldn't find it here.  About the only word I could find was kind of  funny -- skunk.  Yup, skunk.  We seem to have borrowed that word from Mohegan, or at least one of its near linguistic relatives.<br />RECOMMENDATIONS:  If you're interested in the ancient native tongues of southern New England, you may wish to look at Bragdon and Goddard's \\"Native Writings in Massachusett,\\" available from this online bookstore.  For the Rhode Island dialect, try \\"A Key into the Language of America,\\" by Roger Williams.  For a book about the MOHICAN dialect of Algonquian, which, as I said earlier, is NOT the same as Mohegan, but was spoken in more western parts of Connecticut, try \\"Observations on the Mochican Language,\\" by Jonathan Edwards.   For examples of the language spoken in the old New Haven area,look for \\"Abraham Pierson's Some Helps for the Indians,\\" by Abraham Pierson.  For an interesting book to help give some context to the old Mohegan words, look for \\"Native American Place Names of Connecticut,\\" by R. A. Douglas-Lithgow.<br />This book is a helpful work of scholarship, and has been invaluable in helping to restore the heritage of the Mohegan people.  Two thumbs up!	2002-09-01
US	52797729	RS7UVJENO8BGP	0781240255	44556973	Natick Dictionary (Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletins)	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Fascinating and Provocative	This book is a real \\"find.\\" Whoever you are, now that you happen to have come to this book's website, please take a moment to digest how interesting this book is. It is a useful, user-friendly dictionary into the Native American language spoken in Eastern and Central Massachusetts, prior to the coming of the Pilgrims and Puritans. An actual DICTIONARY. Not just a list of towns with Native American names, or a phrase book, but a whole dictionary. This is a serious, major \\"find,\\" if you or someone you know has an interest in this kind of thing, and happen to live in the eastern Massachusetts area.<br />This language was sometimes called Natick, sometimes Massachuset(t), or sometimes Wampanoag. Edward Everett Hale wrote an introduction for this volume, which helps place the topic in historic perspective. James Hammond Trumbull, the dictionary's compiler, was the State Librarian of Connecticut for many years, in the 19th century. He was one of the leading authorities of his time, in various subjects of New England antiquarian interest, and was awarded several honorary degrees from Yale University. He published many other books, leaflets and articles on the topic of the native tongues of pre-colonial New England. If you'd like to see more of his works, look online for a copy of \\"Bibliography Of The Algonquian Languages,\\" by James Constantine Pilling. You can sometimes find a used copy for sale.<br />Trumbull's primary source for this dictionary was John Eliot's so-called \\"Indian Bible,\\" printed in 1663. If you'd like to seek out a copy, you will probably have to find it on microfilm, unless you have access to a really amazing library. The title of the microfilm is listed today as \\"Mamusse wunneetupanatamwe Up-Biblium God naneeswe Nukkone Testament kah wonk Wusku Testament [microform] / ne quoshkinnumuk nashpe Wuttinneumoh Christ noh asoowesit John Eliot,\\" by University Microfilms International, in Ann Arbor, Michigan. If that's too much of a mouthful, (or keyboardful, asthe case may be), try doing keyword searches in a large library's OPAC for the terms \\"Eliot,\\" \\"Massachuset,\\" \\"Bible,\\" and \\"1663.\\" Observe the way I just spelled \\"Massachuset,\\" with one \\"t\\" and no \\"s\\" at the end. Sometimes a library's cataloguer might have spelled it with two \\"t\\"s, but they shouldn't have put in an \\"s.\\" You might need to try a few different spellings, but you should be able to get it in three or four tries.<br />One thing to be careful about -- Trumbull occasionally tries to make speculative connections between these words and the languages of Asia, or the Phoenicians, or the ancient Hebrews. He doesn't do this too much, but it happens now and then. In many ways Trumbull was a creature of his times, of course, and in his field of study, that means that he was prone to speculating rashly about the origins of Native American tongues. Trumbull passed away long before anyone knew about the land bridge across the Bering Staits, so you should try to cut him some slack on this issue. No one really had a clue, about how long the people of this continent had been here. Just try to stick close to the actual dictionary function of this interesting book, and don't get too caught up in the ill-informed etymological speculations.<br />The dictionary itself is almost 350 pages long, and each word is carefully cross-referenced to the biblical verse it appears in, in Eliot. The alphabet used is basically our own, although there are a few differences. There is no letter for b, c, d, f, g, l, v, x, or z. Some of these may seem wrong to Massachusetts residents -- there is obviously a \\"c\\" in the Massachusett tongue, as we can see from the word \\"Massachusetts\\" itself, along with Cochituate, Scituate, etc. However, this a question of orthographic convention, and Trumbull's decision not to include a \\"c\\" is as good as any. He does sometimes have \\"ch\\" as a \\"letter.\\" He considers the two symbols to be inseparable in proper Natick. The only other alphabetic oddity is the existence of a letter for \\"double o,\\" which looks like the symbol for infinity. This is alphabetized right after \\"o.\\"<br />Again, the main use of this book would be to grapple with Eliot's \\"Indian Bible,\\" but you might also want to try using it to make sense of local place names, named by this areas original inhabitants. Try John C. Huden's \\"Indian Place Names of New England,\\" or anything by R. A. Douglas Lithgow, if you'd like a compilation of local indian place names. Or, of course, you could just get a local map from AAA. <br />If you're going to try to use this for Eliot's bible, you may also want to know about his \\"Indian Grammar Begun: Or, an Essay to Bring the Indian Language into Rules, for Help of Such As Desire to Learn the Same.\\" That book is available from this online bookstore. You might also want to look online for the Mashpee Wampanoag Language Revitalization Project, under the leadership of Jessie \\"Little Doe\\" Fermino, which has been trying to bring this ancient tongue back to life. <br />Lastly, I'd like to strongly recommend that you look for \\"Native Writings in Massachusett,\\" by Ives Goddard and Kathleen Bragdon. It's a beautiful two volume set, with a lot of amazing things to offer.	2002-08-19
US	52797729	R3L6IJSQYOSD21	0471998362	928865062	Planet Earth in Jeopardy: Environmental Consequences of Nuclear War	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Helped me to think about the aftermath of nuclear war	I am not an expert in this topic.  Therefore, I need books like this to help keep me informed.  This book was very helpful to me.<br />The book is really very concise, and very digestible, considering its subject matter.  I want to let you know that this volume describes the aftermath of a MAJOR nuclear exchange.  Not that any nuclear exchange could ever be called \\"minor,\\" but this book deals with an all-out, total, full scale war scenario.  It tries to take a scientific look at what the effects of a full scale exchange between the former Soviet Union and the U.S. might have been like.  The effects postulated here, for the most part, are VASTLY worse, for the planet as a whole, than what could happen in a nuclear war between India and Pakistan, for example.  Still, the old weapons are still out there, and it might be worth getting a copy of this to stay informed.  We never know what the future may bring.<br />In chapters that average only about ten or eleven pages, the author walks us through many relevant scenarios.  Chapter One is sort of an intoduction, laying the groundwork for later discussions.  It helps us understand exactly what a \\"megaton\\" is, for example, by comparing megatonnage to the firepower employed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  This chapter also describes the computer modeling used in these forecasts; the basic idea of \\"nuclear winter\\" and how it might be brought about; and related issues such as fallout, EMPs, catastrophic damage to the ozone layer, and chemical disturbances in the Earth's atmosphere resulting from dispersal of chemical-laden smoke.  Uncertainties in the computer models are also discussed.  Chapter Two provides an overview of the world's nuclear arsenals, as of 1985.  It talks in some detail about \\"targeting strategy\\" at the time, and about the possibility of escalation, etc.  Chapter Three goes into the immediate effects of a nuclear exchange -- firestorms, shock waves, etc.  Chapter Four sounds odd at first glance -- it is entitled\\"Smoke and Dust.\\"  But in the reading of the chapter, we are led to understand the huge significance of smoke and dust in nuclear war scenarios.  They are every bit as important to understand as actual fallout.  The huge amounts of smoke and dust released by urban explosions would be expected to remain in the atmosphere for some time, blocking out the sun, and leading ultimately to the nuclear winter sceario.  Chapter Five goes into more detail, about nuclear winter issues affecting climate and weather.  Chapter Six helped me to understand the damage to our ozone layer, which would stem from war of this nature.  It also goes into problems which would arise from the release of huge quantities of toxic gas, from attacks on chemical plants, manufacturing centers, refineries, etc.  Chapter Seven is about what most of us would expect from a book like this -- radiation and fallout.  Chapter Eight is mostly about the way plants would probably respond to war.  I mean \\"plants\\" as in living components of the biosphere which undergo photosynthesis, not automobile manufacturing plants, for example.  The basic message of this chapter is that MANY plants would perish in the sunless months after a major nuclear war, with predictable effects upon our atmosphere.   Chapter Nine takes this issue one step further, and discusses problems which would be expected to arise in the realm of agriculture.  This chapter helps make it clear that famine would be at least as severe a problem, after a nuclear war, as radiation would be.  Not only would the post-war economic chaos make modern agrochemicals impossible to come by, but most plants would simply be killed by summertime frosts, radiation, and lack of sunlight.  In an all-out war, these problems would mean the death of MOST people who had survived the initial blasts and radiation fallout.  Chapter Ten is about broader ecosystem responses to nuclear war, and gets into problems that would arise in the animal kingdom, oceanic ecosystems, etc.  Chapter Eleven is about the human response to all this, and gets into likely psychological problems, economic effects, disruptions in communications, famine, and responses to global, severe cold weather.<br />Another book which you might want to know about, which goes over a lot of the same territory, is Carl Sagan and Paul Ehrlich's \\"The Cold and The Dark.\\"  It, too, is a detailed survey of scientific forecasts of nuclear winter.<br />Lydia Dotto created \\"Planet Earth in Jeopardy: Environmental Consequences of Nuclear War\\" at the behest of the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment, (SCOPE), in 1986.  It is intended to reach a popular audience, but should not be considered to be \\"dumbed down.\\"  Still, if you are interested in finding the original, highly technical reports which provided the background scenarios for this book, look for \\"The Environmental Consequences of Nuclear War,\\" which is a two volume set.  The first volume is subtitled \\"Physical and Atmospheric Effects,\\" and the second volume is subtitled \\"Ecological and Agricultural Effects.\\"  These two volumes came out in 1985, under the imprint of John Wiley and Sons.  The main authors of that report were T.P Ackerman, P.J. Crutzen, M.A. Harwell, T.P. Hutchinson, M.C. McCracken, A.B. Pittock, C.S. Shapiro, and R.P. Turco.  It is a distillation of research conducted by hundreds of scientists, all over the world, over a period of many years.<br />While recognizing that these studies are, (thank God), essentially speculative in nature, it is good to at least be aware of what these scientific speculations are.  I don't understand why so few people are aware of this important book.  Please get a copy, and ask your neighbors, friends, co-workers and family to get copies as well.	2002-08-02
US	52797729	RSI4J9O8EQ3X2	2884490477	746800196	The Art of Richard P. Feynman: Images by a Curious Character	Books	5	20	20	N	N	What a find!	This is a really terrific collection. In this book are many of the little-known sketches and paintings of the late, great physicist/folk hero Richard P. Feynman. I sought this book out after reading Ralph Leighton's Feynman biography \\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!\\" I'm glad I went to the trouble to do so.<br />The book commences with a foreword by Albert Hibbs, whom many Feynman fans will recognize as Feynman's friend and co-author of \\"Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals.\\" Don't skip over this foreword. Hibbs has a lot of interesting things to say about how visual Feynman was in all his projects, including his style of doing physics.<br />After the foreword is a helpful preface by Feynman's daughter Michelle. (Michelle works as a photographer, and was the primary person in charge of selecting these artworks). She describes some interesting features of Feynman family life, such as the fact that many of the models for these paintings became lifelong Feynman family friends. She gives us a fun little window into the experience of \\"growing up Feynman.\\"<br />This book also contains Feyman's wry, interesting essay \\"But is it Art?\\" from \\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!,\\" as well as a selection of biographical sketches from four of Fenman's friends, including three artists and his biographer.<br />The actual sketches are really pretty good, in my humble opinion. There are about a hundred pages of black and white sketches, including charcoal, pencil, and ink wash drawings. Many are quite simple and direct. Others clearly took quite a bit of time.<br />Let me give you a friendly warning here, incidentally. Leafing through this section, you will go through page after page of sketches of young, beautiful women, in a variety of attractive poses. This will lead you to a pleasant, happy, blissed out frame of mind. Suddenly, with absolutely no warning whatsoever, you will turn the page and be confronted by the dilapidated, craggy, wrinkled face of an anonymous, elderly malephysics professor, frowning under a ponderously furrowed unibrow, glaring out of the book at you. Be warned, O reader, and try not to have a seizure. Also included among these sketches are occasional other topics, such as Feyman's dog Rufus, and a few \\"one minute line drawings\\" (a common exercise in art classes)... Personally, I think Figure 87 is pretty neat. It includes small sketches of various subjects -- a woman, faces, a plant, a sleeping dog, and more. But there's more -- the background is full of Feynman's equations! They wind all over the place, throughout the drawing. It makes for kind of a neat juxtaposition. I could definitely see that sketch making a great poster.<br />After the black and white sketches are a small collection of color paintings, including a sketch of a little town, and Feynman's trusty dog Rufus.<br />Basically, if you are a Feynman fan, this book will go a long way toward rounding out your appreciation of him. Besides, there are some really terrific pictures in here. Two thumbs up!	2002-08-01

I am disappointed that there are over two million other books which are purchased more frequently than this one, according to Amazon.com -- it just doesn't seem right.<br />Querida Pearce has done a great deal of work, in compiling this amazing little volume.  Conversations about dinosaurs are one of the few areas where adults and children can really be complete equals together, sharing in a state of wonder.  Actually, as often as not, the adults are at a disadvantage here.  Children often know MUCH more than the less age-challenged, height-challenged members of their families, about this fascinating topic.  Therefore, to help adults bridge this unfortunate gap, Ms. Pearce has created this guide.<br />Let me just briefly mention that this book came out a couple of years before the film \\"Jurassic Park.\\"  It happens that some of the dinosaurs featured in that film were almost completely unknown, to most folks, before the film came out.  Velociraptors, in particular, are only mentioned in passing in \\"How to Talk Dinosaur With Your Child.\\"  And the Tyrannosaurus Rex is always referred to by its full name, never as a \\"T. Rex.\\"  But those are small complaints, of course.  This book is basically superb, and has been highly praised by curators at museums featuring paleontology exhibits.<br />Here are some particularly fun features of this book.  In Chapter 8, the author talks about how you could prepare for a visit to a dinosaur museum with your children.  She helps you get thinking about how you could create a dinosaur diorama, for example, to help your kids understand how the displays in the museum are made.  In Chapter 11, there's a great little section about dinosaur names.  It gives handy definitions of all the little Latin and Greek prefixes, suffixes, and other roots which go into composing the names of dinosaurs.  You can even use this section to start making up dino-names for family, friends, or pets.  For example, if you havea dog with very triangular ears, and a short tail, you could take the roots \\"spheno\\" (wedge shaped); \\"oto\\" (ear); \\"micro\\" (small); and \\"urus\\" (tail), and start calling your dog Sphenooto Microurus.  This is how scientists really name dinosaurs!  You and your children can share a lot of laughs with this section.<br />The whole book is packed with ideas for dinner table discussions, or for talking about during agonizingly long car rides.  For example, Ms. Pearce encourages readers to think about the devastation that would be left behind if a herd of diplodoci crashed through the local jungle.  She suggests going to the library, and seeking out accounts of how African jungles have sprung back after rampages by groups of elephants.  The whole book is full of suggestions like this.  They go on, page after page after page.  I don't know how she thought up so many great ideas.<br />As I said earlier, some parts of this book are realy designed to help adults catch up to their kids, who are most likely miles ahead of them in their knowledge of dino-lore.  But the focus is on finding common ground, and things to share wonder about.  This book is actually about real wonder, real scientific discovery, and real fun.  This book represents what learning really should be like, although of course it rarely actually is.<br />If you enjoy this fine little volume, I would like to recommend \\"After Man: A Zoology of the Future,\\" by Dougal Dixon, which is also incredibly fun and interesting.  It gets kids asking \\"what if\\" we could see into the future, and visualize how present animals might evolve in coming millenia?  It has amazing pictures, and provocative essays.  Also, you may wish to take a look at \\"Our Continent: A Natural History of North America,\\" by National Geographic.  They did a great job with that book, and it includes actual charts so you can see how various dinosaurs evolved.  Also, just a slightly oddball recommendation: I really enjoyed the book \\"When Geologists Were Historians,\\" by Rhoda Rappaport.  It helps you see what early scientists were up against, when they tried to get people to conceptualize the idea that rocks were laid down in layers, some of which contained dinosaur bones.<br />Anyway,  \\"How to Talk Dinosaur With Your Child\\"  is superb.  You owe it to your kids, or maybe even to a co-workers kids, to pick up a copy of this book.	2002-07-31
US	52797729	R16XQJLFY7SAHH	0713483520	392811214	Exodus to Arthur: Catastrophic Encounters With Comets	Books	5	25	26	N	N	Don't judge this book by its cover!!!	This book contains incredibly important, scientific observations and conclusions, about the past few thousand years of Earth's history.  Unfortunately, the publishers seem to have adorned this brilliant work of science with one of the silliest book jackets I've ever seen in my life.  Let me just say right now that I have communicated with the author about this, and the book jacket was NOT his choice.<br />The author, Mike Baillie, is a highly respected professor of palaeoecology at Queen's University Belfast, in Northern Ireland.  More than anyone else, he has pioneered the study of \\"dendrochronology,\\" which is the study of ancient tree rings, and how widely spaced they are in a given year, to infer climate and weather conditions for the years being studied.  Basically, the technique is perfectly logical.  In a year with terrible weather, trees grow less.  Makes sense, right?  Well, indeed, this is always the case, and it is possible to see tiny discrepancies in tree growth from year to year, even today.  Now, what would you think if you noticed that, at some time in the distant past, trees seem to have gone several years in a row with hardly any growth at all?  Scary, eh?  What would this mean to you?  Well, if you think it over for long enough, you should conclude that SOMETHING was probably blotting out the sun's life-giving rays to such a great extent that trees simply could not grow.  If trees could not grow well, it follows that agriculture probably suffered as well.  And if agriculture suffered badly enough, there might even be records of actual civilizations crumbling and vanishing.<br />Professor Baillie has isolated five such periods, in our relatively recent past.  These periods took place in 2354-2345 B.C., 1628-1623 B.C., 1159-1141 B.C., 208-204 B.C., and A.D. 536-545.  For each of these periods, he has sought to locate historical records, or at least old legends, which might provide some evidence of terrible times for mankind.  Sure enough, he always seems to come through with something or other.  My favorite part is the A.D. 536-545 period, for which he has made a faily plausible case of being connected to the old legends of king Arthur's Wasteland.   Usually quite a bit of detective work is required here, but more often than not he can make a strong case for something having happened to our climate, at irregular intervals of a few centuries.<br />The title makes plain what he has concluded to be the likely culprits -- comets and asteroids, and possibly an occasional volcano.  Current astronomical theory, in fact, actually does hold that statistically, we really should expect to have been hit a few times since the dawn of civilization.  Not by anything as bad as the monster asteroid that immolated the dinosaurs -- we would certainly remember that!  But even much more moderate-sized asteroids could reasonably be expected to cause significant, widespread social disruption.<br />I would like to point out, to whoever is reading this, that TWO of professor Baillie's theories in this book have already begun receiving substantial confirmation, since 1999.  For example, Baillie believes that something awful happened to the world climate in about 2350 B.C.  One of the biggest underreported stories of 2001, pushed off the front pages by the events of September 11, was the discovery of a asteroid-created crater in southern Iraq.  It's almost 2 miles in diameter.  Many scientists feel that the crater could be the \\"smoking gun\\" to explain the events of around 2350 B.C.  If you are interested in learning more about this important topic, you don't even need to stand up.  Just open another window on your browser, go to any search engine you like, and do a search for the terms \\"2350,\\" \\"asteroid,\\" \\"crater,\\" and \\"Iraq.\\"  You should get a few hits.  If that doesn't work, try searching for \\"Sharad Master.\\"  He is the South African geophysicist who discovered the crater, while looking at satellite photos of southern Iraq.  He will bepresenting his findings at a conference at Brunel University, in the U.K., at the end of August 2002.  Hopefully, this time it will get better press coverage than last year.<br />The other theory which has gotten more attention, since 1999, concerns the event of A.D. 536-545.  If you'd like to learn more about this, I'd like to recommend that you read \\"Catastrophe: An Investigation into the Origins of Modern Civilization,\\" by David Keys.<br />\\"Exodus to Arthur is a really important book, and I don't understand why it went out of print.  It must be because of the stupid cover.  Well, listen to the proverbs your grandparents taught you, and DON'T judge this book by its cover.  Find a copy and read it.  Two thumbs way up.	2002-07-31
US	52797729	R2MFREZ4AN8X77	0415157188	778346691	The Politics of Language in Ireland 1366-1922: A Sourcebook	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A useful, interesting compilation	This is a really interesting compilation of source material, most of which is basically impossible to find in any other way.  You really get an great overview here, of the preposterous things real people actually said, on the topic of eradicating the native tongue of an entire nation of people.  <br />Tony Crowley has assembled almost 150 short selections here, dating from 1366 to 1922.  They are divided up chronologically, (not thematically), into six sections.  Each section has its own little introduction.  Make sure you spend some time on all the introductions, unless you happen to have a serious background in this area.  If you fail to do this, you'll miss out on the significance of what you're seeing here.  In fact, I'd recommend making an effort to read each introduction through twice, and supplementing your reading with some background research.  I recommend a few pretty good books to look at, at the end of this review.  I'm not an expert though, so you should definitely do some shopping around on your own.<br />The selections are usually very concise, averaging only about a page and a half.  Some pages contain two or even three selections.  Other selections go on for as long as six or seven pages.  The selected quotes are drawn from sources including various translations of the bible, law codes, cultural commentary, plays, and more.  There are a wide range of authors represented, both Irish and English.  Some quotes come from well known figures such as Jonathan Swift, Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Daniel O'Connell, Yeats, or Synge.  (The Daniel O'Connell entry is not what you might imagine it should be -- check it out.  It's dated 1833.)<br />One interesting thing I noticed is that it seems that one of the major forces at work, in the early years of outlawing Irish, was a form of cultural self-defense by the English.  The English were afraid of losing their colonial administrators to \\"Gaelicisation,\\" by means of which Englishmen became more Irish in terms of speech, conduct, dress, etc.  I never  knew this to have been the case.  It's really interesting to read about.  The English probably had very little idea, when they first started legislation to keep Irish \\"outside the Pale\\" where English predominated, how far things would go.<br />Recommendations for further reading: If you'd like some further reading, to give you a better sense of context for this great book, I would like to recommend that you look at the following titles.  For a good Irish historical atlas, try \\"Atlas of Irish History,\\" by Sean Duffy.  For a beautifully written, excellent survey of Irish literature over the centuries, ask your local librarian to help you track down a copy of \\"The Irish Tradition\\" by Robin Flower.  There seem to be a number of good, concise histories of Ireland, but I'm just starting to get a sense of their relative merits.  You're on your own there!  ... offers customer reviews of several that look pretty good, so I recommend that you shop around in that manner.  Finally, for a very interesting book about the historical perceptions of the Irish language in the United States, I'd like to recommend that you look at \\"The Irish Language in the United States: A Historical, Sociolinguistic, and Applied Linguistic Survey,\\" by Thomas W. Ihde.	2002-07-25
US	52797729	R1002QRI9CGNDI	0870441531	255686859	Our Continent: Natural History of North America	Books	5	7	7	N	N	One of my favorite books, both as a child and today	&quot;Our Continent: A Natural History of North America,&quot; is a fascinating, user-friendly, beautifully photographed and illustrated volume.  It is divided into two sections:  &quot;The Kingdoms of Life,&quot; which is devoted to discussions and reconstructions of various animals from our continent's remote past; and &quot;The Living Land,&quot; an amazing survey of the geological eras through which our vast land has passed.<br />The chapter-length essays are all carefully organized, highly accessible, and often liberally festooned with poetic quotes about nature, drawn from a panoply of philosophers and poets.<br />The section on (formerly) living beings has a wide range of specially commissioned paintings, of ancient animals, many of which are extinct today.  We don't just see the dinosaurs, however.  Ample attention is paid to the period between the dinosaurs and the present, famously portrayed in the BBC/Discovery Channel's classic &quot;Walking with Prehistoric Beasts.&quot;  If you enjoyed that film, I can guarantee that you'll find a lot to smile about in this excellent volume...  In fact, if you're coming to this review from my review of the &quot;Walking with Prehistoric Beasts&quot; DVD, I'll tell you right now that the sections of this book most germane to that topic lie between pp. 118 and 160.  The 120s have the most helpful charts, etc., in my opinion.  One useful part of this chapter explains in detail how artists have sought to reconstruct the appearance of extinct creatures.  The book is full of helpful explanations of such things, which is why I chose to refer to it as &quot;user-friendly.&quot;<br />As a child, my favorite parts of this book were the evolutionary development charts, on pages 59, 81, and 122.  These charts show the branches of life developing, and evolving, from one era of prehistory to the next.  These charts would make FANTASTIC visual aids for any classroom discussion on evolution.  If you choose to pick up a copy of this great book, I hope you take it to your local school system's A/V Department, and ask them to make some visuals for the school science department.  Seriously, you should think about doing this.  I sometimes review multimedia educational products for &quot;Library Journal,&quot; and this book has always stood out in my eyes as something special.  I often use it as a sort of inner yardstick, to gauge my reaction to other science products....  Another useful part of this tome is the detachable &quot;Wheel of Time,&quot; a cardboard sleeved disc which can be manipulated in such a way as to visually pair up various long-lost animals with their concurrent relatives from ancient times.  It's a little tricky to explain, but take my word for it, you'll love it.<br />The section on geology is quite interesting as well, albeit in a more stately way.  We are treated here to beautiful photographs, and intelligently compiled diagrams, delineating the forces that have shaped the very underlying rock upon which we walk, sit, build, and sleep.  Canyons are discussed here, and coastlines.  Deserts, the Canadian Shield, and the Great Lakes are all made comprehensible.  This is all done quite concisely, I should add.  Indeed, were it not for the host of full-page photographs that adorn so many of these pages, this book would be perhaps a quarter as many pages.  The chapters are, without exception, readily digestible.<br />My only caveat is that, becaue this book came out in the 1970s, the authors were as yet unaware of one or two major events in our continent's past.  Particularly, I'm thinking of Yellowstone Park's disconcerting tendency to simply explode in a truly titanic volcanic eruption, every 600,000 years or so.  When this happens, most of North America west of the Mississippi gets crushed under several feet of ash, and a &quot;nuclear winter,&quot; lasting a few years, ensues.  People didn't understand this nearly as well when this book came out, and the topic is not well covered.  If you'd like to read more about this important topic, go to your favorite search engine and just type in the search terms &quot;yellowstone&quot; and &quot;supervolcano.&quot;   By the way, if you enjoy reading about our geological heritage, I would like to recommend that you seriously contemplate possessing yourself of a volume of John McPhee's &quot;Annals of the Former World.&quot;  Actually, you can't go wrong with anything at all by McPhee, but that's the best place to start.<br />I am very happy to find that this fine book can still be purchased.  We had a copy of &quot;Our Continent&quot; as a coffee table book in the late 70's, when I was in 4th-6th grade or so.  This is a terrific coffee table book to leave around the home, if your aim is, with an artful pretense of carelessness, to surreptitiously foster a love of science in your own, or in someone else's, unsuspecting offspring.   It was a cherished, educational-yet-fun part of my childhood, and I'm very pleased to recommend to you that you help me pass the good karma along.  Two thumbs way, way up.	2002-07-25
US	52797729	R15HD0QUY03KJE	089789331X	53707839	The Irish Language in the United States: A Historical, Sociolinguistic, and Applied Linguistic Survey	Books	4	11	12	N	N	An Unexpected Pleasure	I happened to come across this fascinating book in the library.  What an interesting concept for a book!  Irish speakers in the U.S.?  Have there really been Irish-American communities which have kept up the old tongue?  If this idea is intriguing to you, I highly recommend checking out this thoughtfully conceived, intelligently compiled little volume.<br />Thomas Ihde lays out his material in two primary sections.  First, there are the scholarly articles, of which there are eleven included.  This section contains historical and sociolinguistic essays, which, by the way,  are quite readable even to the non-linguist.  These essays include surveys of Irish usage among Irish-Americans, from all geographic regions, and from all historic periods.  We learn about the social stigma of speaking Irish, among actual Irish people as well as among the general American community.  Yet, these essays reveal an increasing interest, in recent decades, in reviving the ancient, nearly-lost tongue of the Emerald Isle.<br />I have two favorite parts, in this section of the book.  First, there is the interview with a native Irish speaker (which is incredibly rare, even in Ireland) who teaches Irish classes to Americans.  He has a nice sense of humor, and has developed some creative ways to teach Irish to his students.  Second, I enjoyed hearing about the small community of &quot;Travellers&quot; in South Carolina and Texas, who are kind of like Irish gypsies.  They have actually maintained a core vocabulary of an odd Irish/English hybrid speech, since their arrival in America around the time of the Civil War.  We only learn a tantalizingly small amount about these folks, but there is a helpful bibliography for further reading.<br />The end of the first section includes surveys and descriptions of available teaching materials, including discussions of their comparative merits.  These sections are mostly written by Thomas Ihde personally, although some others have contributed their thoughts.  The second section of the book, &quot;Personal Essays,&quot; is largely a continuation of this part of the first section.   There are seven of these essays -- most of them are only a few pages long.  People describe their efforts to learn or teach Irish, and also describe the significance of their classes to themselves, or to the Irish-American community.  There are some really thoughtful contributions here.  I enjoyed some contributions which might not be completely appropriate for inclusion here, in the strictest terms, but which nevertheless added to the book.  I'm thinking particularly of an essay by Liam O'Murchadha and Caitlin Ui Murchadha, describing their visit to Ireland and their efforts to communicate and learn the language.<br />I myself happen to be partially of Irish descent.  Like many others of this ethnicity, I grew up with a vague sense that while other foreign countries had their own actual languages, Ireland only seemed to have English with a funny accent.  This unusual book helps me get a whole new perspective on Irish, as an American and simply as a human being.  Two thumbs up.	2002-07-13
US	52797729	R1VO0WTMNFXXDH	0870236970	840226636	Historical Atlas of Massachusetts	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Fills a real void	If you're a native of this state, this book would be fantastic as a coffee table book, or as part of a library's reference collection.  At more than 150 oversized pages, replete with full-color illustrations, it contains vastly more information than one might anticipate.  But this doesn't mean the book is confusing -- far from it.<br />This atlas is organized into two primary sections.  First, there is \\"The Historical Landscape,\\" which focuses mainly upon more hard-nosed ways of viewing the human experience.  By this I mean that it deals with political and economic power, and how they were manifested, both in the colonial period and as part of the United States.  I hasten to add that this section starts out with a terrific set of maps about the native American presence in Massachusetts, prior to Verrazano, and prior to the Pilgrims.  Maps show specifically where the most ancient native settlements were located, shortly after the Ice Age.  Moving forward, they help us see how local tribal groups divided up the state territory; they show locations of native villages and footpaths; and detail interactions between tribes and early traders and explorers.  The rest of this section breaks up the colonial period via a variety of helpful, cartographic means, such as the spread of towns across the state, and depictions of colonial Boston in various stages.  Next, it deals with Massachusetts after the industrial and American revolutions.  Demographic trends are helpfully depicted pictorially, such as Boston's burgeoning growth over the decades; the spread of railroads; and the growing number of wage-earners statewide.<br />The second section of this useful tome tends more toward the \\"soft sciences,\\" although it is somewhat equivocally entitled \\"The Political and Social Landscape.\\"  This part of the atlas includes chapters giving cartographic presentations of \\"Women and Society,\\" \\"Ethnicity and Race,\\" \\"Health and the Social Order,\\" and \\"Architecture and the Built Environment.\\"Subsequent chapters in this section focus on technological developments, such as communications, transportation, and energy, and how these issues have affected Massachusetts demographics.  The book ends with an interesting little chapter on the Quabbin Reservoir, and its environmental and social impact.<br />Don't miss the terrific bibliography, in the section near the end called \\"Sources.\\"  There is a helpful statistical appendix also, giving various figures for each town, going up to 1995.  The 1995 figures were projected (this book came out in 1991).  <br />One of my personal favorite maps in this book is on page 5, where the authors helpfully present a breakdown of the origins of Massachusetts town names.  We see that most are named after English towns, while quite a few take their names from early Puritan or American settlers.  Native American place names are fairly well represented in town names (Mattapoisett, Seekonk, Agawam, Scituate, etc.) as, of course, in the name of our state.  <br />This book is not only useful, it's also fascinating and fun.  I'd recommend it to anyone...  I've reviewed a lot of books on Amazon.com, and because I usually review what I like, I tend to give a lot of stars.  This one makes me wish I was more cautious in my awarding of stars, so my five star ranking of this great book would mean more.	2002-07-07

It helps us understand how truly gigantic culture shock can be, and how unbelievably lucky we all are to live in this protected Disneyland that we call America. <br />Most of these amazing people have lived through things that would make other Americans ashamed, to complain of the things in our lives that we consider \\"major problems.\\" One African refugee describes how his father was literally forced to applaud, while 14 year old \\"soldiers\\" killed some of his own children right in front of him. Others are fleeing starvation so terrible that they were forced to eat grass, dogs, or worse. Yet here these people are, smiling hopefully at their new neighbors, hoping to start a better life as fellow Americans.<br />What is the internet? They don't know. What is an \\"atom bomb\\"? Many people around the world are apparently unaware that it exists. What is money? Refugees from primitive tribes don't really \\"get\\" the concept. Will voting for a certain political candidate endanger their children's lives, if the opponent wins? Their lives have led them to think so. <br />You have to root for these incredible people. It makes you want to go out and meet some refugees, and talk to them for yourself. One might suspect that some of them are fearful of what is happening in our country right now (lawful FBI surveillance, etc.) but the fact is, people from cultures with different alphabets literally can't even spell ACLU, FBI, CNN, or even ABC. They're so lost it boggles the mind. They need friends to help them understand. They need you.<br />Mary Pipher has divided her inspiring testament into three parts. The first part, \\"Hidden in Plain Sight,\\" deals with the initial arrival of refugees, and their efforts to make sense of America. The second part, \\"Refugees across the Life Cycle,\\" walks us through a collection of vignettes based upon the experiences, respectively, of children, teens, young adults, and parents in refugee families. The third part, \\"The Alchemy of Healing -- Turning Pain into Meaning,\\" helps us see how incredibly strong these people are, and how their strength, compassion, and wisdom are guided and tempered by their experiences. Finally, there are three VERY helpful little appendices, giving specific, detailed advice about real ways that readers can get involved, and make a difference, in our own hometowns.<br />Would you like to get a quick visual sense of just how \\"white bread\\" the Lincoln, Nebraska area is, to understand the preposterous homogeneity in which these lost, bewildered, global refugees must find a place? If so, I'd like to recommend that you see the 1999 Reese Witherspoon/Matthew Broderick film \\"Election.\\" It was filmed just a few miles down route 80 from Lincoln, and not only is every single face visible in the film of European extraction -- I think they are literally ALL of NORTHERN European extraction. I'm serious. Don't get me wrong -- they're perfectly nice people (often incredibly nice, actually, as Mary Pipher makes clear), but not necessarily too well-prepared for diversity in their community. That's what these refugees need to face.<br />If you enjoy this book, I would like to recommend that you seek out \\"The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down,\\" by Anne Fadiman, which is about Laotian refugees in Massachusetts. Also, look online for the UNHCR (United Nations High Commission for Refugees) website, which has a lot of nice features to keep you informed about refugees worldwide.	2002-06-19

The fictional war was fought between the U.S. and Russia, and destroyed New York, Washington, and San Antonio, Texas.  The authors recount their memories of The Day when the war happened, and describe numerous survival scenarios in the context of limited nuclear war.<br />This book is only a fictional account -- of course, the authors can't be expected to have thought of every tiny detail.  They can't be expected to generate an absolutely flawless vision of a nation struggling to recover from limited nuclear war.  That said -- they sure do give it a heck of a good shot!<br />Many books of this nature are filled with science-fiction garbage, such as post-nuclear mutants with super powers.  Sometimes, picking up a book like this, one might expect the basic science to be compltely ignored, in favor of dramatic tension, or character development.  Not that those elements are lacking here, but Streiber and Kunetka (a respected science journalist) clearly did a great deal of research to create scientifically plausible guesses about how things really might be.  The book includes fictional interviews with fictional post-nuclear war economists, schoolteachers, junior high students, military officials, and others.  These \\"interviews,\\" in my opinion, are some of the real strengths of the book.  Reading this, you feel like you're a fly on the wall in a high security think tank, watching officials game out all the ramifications of each sub-component of a hypothetical post-nuke scenario.<br />My copy of this book contains rave reviews inside the front cover, by such eminent government figures as Congressman Ed Markey (Democrat, from Mass.), Senator Ted Kennedy (Democrat, from Mass.), and Senator Mark Hatfield (Republican, from Oregon).  If you don't want to listen to me, listen to them. They seem to feel that Streiber and Kunetka made a serious effort to come to grips with some of the most important issues of a limited nuclear war, in this book.<br />I'd like to stress here that this book is about some of the possible ramifications of a LIMITED nuclear war.  It doesn't get into nuclear winter, or other effects of an all out nuclear war.  In these days of smaller scale \\"dirty bombs,\\" etc, this book could help us visualize what is probably right around the corner.  It can help to assuage future panic, by addressing it in advance.  This book portrays some extremely ugly events, and makes me wish to high heaven I lived in the 19th century, or any time when we didn't need to worry about such horrendous scenarios.  Still, the fact is that these events can and will take place, so it's better to do whatever we can to head off our own panic.  If we panic, we make things worse for everyone.  Reading this book is a small step you could take, in the right direction.<br />I would also like to recommend the 1984 British BBC TV-movie \\"Threads,\\" which takes a similar approach to delineating the events surrounding a far more serious nuclear war.  \\"Threads\\" even gets into issues of nuclear winter, which are not necessary to worry about in the event of smaller scale wars, such as the one portrayed in \\"Warday.\\"   \\"Threads\\" is available by credit card from the British Amazon.com sister corporation.<br />If you're trying to get better informed, I would like to recommend the non-fiction books \\"Planet Earth in Jeopardy: Environmental Consequences of Nuclear War,\\" by Lydia Dotto, and \\"The Cold and the Dark\\" by Paul Ehrlich and Carl Sagan.<br />This book is really scary, but you should probably read it.  Two miserable thumbs up.	2002-06-11
US	52797729	R37ZOXU1IC9QW	0201154943	419858014	Rain Of Iron And Ice: The Very Real Threat Of Comet And Asteroid Bombardment (Helix Books)	Books	5	15	16	N	N	Don't worry about my review -- just read the book	This fine book is designed primarily with one goal in mind.   Aimed at a popular audience, it is written to counteract the unfortunately widespread myth that no one has ever been killed, or will ever be killed, by a falling asteroid or meteor. John Lewis reworks this statement, reminding us that the way it should be phrased is as follows: \\"no one as ever been killed or hurt by a meteor or asteroid in the presence of a Western, 20th/21st century journalist or meteoriticist.\\"<br />This book demonstrates, through statistics and anecdotes,  that it is more than just a question of occasional asteroids like the one that killed the dinosaurs, or like the ones in the asteroid movies from the summer of 1999. There is an extremely wide range of asteroids, meteors, and other random space-rocks, of all different shapes, sizes, and compositions. The ones large enough to do fairly serious damage land all over the planet, and substantially more often than many of us tend to believe. <br />Chapter 14 alone is worth the price of the book. In it, Dr. Lewis shows us computer simulations of several likely asteroid strikes. Let me clarify that -- he presents the results of computer simulations of 10 randomly computer-generated \\"centuries\\" on Earth, and what the statistical likelihood of pretty awful asteroid collisions are in each century. Many of the simulations are pretty terrifying. The one that opens the chapter, taking place in the Phillipines, is one of the most horrifying things you'll ever read.<br />Another valuable part of the book is the table in chapter 13, which lists dozens of damaging asteroid or meteor strikes throughout recorded history, all over the world. Stories like this crop up throughout the book, they aren't just in chapter 13.<br />The intent of this book is to raise public awareness. It succeeds dramatically. Please buy a copy, and get copies for some of your friends. Two thumbs up.	2002-06-10

He goes into great detail about what is known, or what is theorized, about the original meanings of the names of places.  The author has done a lot of research into the little known field of \\"onomastics,\\" or place names.  The title is kind of a misnomer -- a fair number of the place names discussed here are not technically \\"English,\\" but Celtic.  A few may even date to pre-Celtic times, although it's impossible to be completely sure about things that became set in tradition so long before the advent of writing in the region.  Other place names come from the viking period and language of the Danelaw (known as Old Norse); from the French incursion after the Norman Conquest; or even Breton and Flemish, from when the uber-jerk Henry II employed Flemish and Breton knights and mercenaries to kill problematic upstarts for him.  Cameron has included short chapters on each of these sources of place names.  He has several chapters about the meanings of geographic locales,and fills the book out with surprisingly interesting discussion of the grammar behind these place names.<br />My only real problem with this book is that there are hardly any maps.  There should be more of them.<br />Speaking as an American, and one who has never been to the U.K., you may well wonder \\"What in the name of all that's holy was Ed doing, in reading this book?!\\"  Fair enough.  I sought it out because many of the towns in pleasant, albeit meteorologically schizophrenic Massachusetts, where I live, were named after English towns.  As you go farther west in America, more and more towns were named after settlers last names, or Spanish cities of terms, instead of English towns.  Still, if you live in the East, you'll find a lot of familiar names here.  One of my favorite examples would be the following...  Framingham is a town in the metrowest suburbs of Boston, in Massachusetts.  It's English onomastic progenitor was named Framingham, meaning(in the Dark Ages) \\"homestead or hamlet (ham) of the descendents or dependents (ing, from Old English ingas) of Fram.  \\"Fram,\\" most likely, was some kind of particularly humongous Dark Age barbarian warlord, from the 6th or 7th century AD or so, who scared everyone into letting him call himself their \\"protector.\\"  That's one name.  There are many more... <br />Be aware of the helpful little table in back, which helps clear up the meanings of especially common parts of words.  -Burg, -ton, -ford, -by, -cester, -wich...  all these are explained, and more.<br />There's a nice little bibliography in back, which you should definitely look at.  If you enjoy the topic, seek out the publications of the \\"English Place Names Society,\\" or any articles or books by Margaret Gelling.  Also -- if you have an interest in the meaning of words handed down from the olden days, you should think about reading about the names of stars.  They're really intriguing, too.  I recommend \\"Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning,\\" by Richard Hinckley Allen, or \\"Short Guide to Modern Star Names and Their Derivations\\" by Paul Kunitzsch (watch that spelling) and Tim Smart.<br />This book would have benefitted from some maps, but I basically enjoyed it a lot.  Two thumbs up.	2002-06-08
US	52797729	R14AUG4RL82JWT	0304352098	223452736	Apocalypse	Books	5	10	10	N	N	NOT religious eschatology... this is actual science.	This book is absolutely terrifying.  Each chapter goes into a different cataclysmic natural event, which, the authors show us, is certain to take place sooner or later.  There are chapters on monstrous mega-tsunamis; stupendous super-volcanoes; economically egregious earthquakes; and, well, apocalyptic asteroid strikes.  Each chapter is carefully presented, using as conservative data as possible.  The authors help us understand that ALL of these events have happened before in Earth's history, over and over again, at irregular intervals.  These disasters, we are shown, usually aren't even thousands of years apart -- only a few hundred.  Every one of these disasters is certain to happen again, and again, and again.<br />Statistics are given, but please don't worry if you have math-phobia.  It is perfectly possible to get a vastly enhanced understanding of these perils, while paying only minimal attention to the statistics.  The text makes everything quite clear.  <br />As an additional, macabre, morbid bonus, readers are treated here to four mini-thrillers.  The end of each chapter contains a little fictional scenario about how the event under discussion might play out.  The authors make the not-terribly-unreasonable assumption that each scenario might take place some time within the next century or so.  (They aren't suggesting that ALL of these events will happen during the next century -- they simply construct each separate, unrelated scenario within that timeframe.)  Each mini-thriller is about 5 or 10 pages long.  Two of the events portrayed lead to only a relatively moderate negative outcome -- total, absolute, utter global economic collapse, requiring decades for a recovery.  That's the MODERATELY negative outcome.  The other two mini-thrillers end with the whole planet being plunged into a new Dark Age, which the authors speculate could last for centuries.  I'll leave it up to you to see which disasters are the really bad ones.<br />Most alert people today arereasonably familiar with the asteroid threat, and with the possibility of catastrophic earthquakes.  Two scenarios which, bizarrely enough, have received significantly less attention in the popular media, are the \\"super-volcano\\" scenario, and the possibility of a \\"mega-tsunami\\" inundating the east coast of the United States.  This book helps us understand how bad things could be, and how real the threat is.  Did you know that all of Yellowstone Park is basically the top of a gigantic underground volcano, which could wipe out about 10 states overnight if it ever blew?  I, for one, was totally unaware of this.  Not only that -- scientists have proven that the Yellowstone Supervolcano blows up approximately once every 600,000 years.  The last time it exploded was about 640,000 years ago.  Do the math, and think carefully about your next vacation plans.<br />Let me quickly add that all the events described in this terrific book are NATURAL disasters.  There's nothing about nuclear war, for example.  As long as you're on a disaster kick... I'd like to recommend \\"Planet Earth in Jeopardy: Environmental Consequences of Nuclear War,\\" by Lydia Dotto.  In the same vein, you might want to find a copy of \\"The Cold and the Dark,\\" by Carl Sagan and Paul Ehrlich.  Both of these books are detailed discussions of what scientists think nuclear winter might be like.<br />I myself am not a geophysicist, an oceanologist, or an astronomer.  Therefore, I need books like this to keep me informed.  If you are like me, you will benefit from this book, and your friends could benefit as well.  I recommend that you buy a copy, and talk it up amongst your friends, co-workers, and family.  We should all be better informed about these issues.  Two thumbs up for Bill McGuire and Maggie O'Hanlon, for this incredibly important book.	2002-06-03

Before I say anything else, let me state as clearly as possible that I am not an expert in this topic.  Sometimes it isn't always clear, reading Amazon.com reviews, whether the writer is an expert or just someone who read the book.  I am in the second of those categories.  Let me quickly mention that I have also read Lydia Dotto's \\"Planet Earth in Jeopardy: Environmental Consequences of Nuclear War,\\" and I found that to be quite helpful as well.  I put some more helpful commenst on my Amazon.com review of that book.<br />This book is one of the scariest things I've ever read.  It clued me in on entirely new things over which people should be losing sleep.  Did you know that one of the major threats of nuclear war is the threat of strikes on oil refineries?  Such strikes can release unbelievably quantities of sun-blocking smog into the air.  Did you know that radiation caused directly by nuclear bombs is relatively insignificant, compared to the radiation that would be released if such bombs fell on reactors?  Reactors have fuel rods and waste which will remain lethally radioactive for DECADES after the radiation from a nuclear war reached tolerable levels.  This book is full of information like this.  It is all presented quite accessibly.  Also, there is a fantastic question and answer section at the end, which includes back and forth sessions between eminent scientists in related fields.  This section alone is worth the price of the book.<br />Let me point out that the main author listed for this book is only one of many cotributors.  Paul Ehrlich has a lot to say here, but it is always made clear when he is writing, or when it's someone else, e.g. Carl Sagan or Lewis Thomas.  I make this point here because I wouldn't want anyone to decide against buying this valuable book, because of Ehrlich's old reputation for being an alarmist.  In the 1970s, as a member of the \\"Club of Rome,\\" Ehrlich made some irresponsible statements about the dangers of population growth and energy shortages.  Time has shown that he actually wasn't entirely wrong, but his timetables for his predictions were often overly pessimistic.  Be that as it may, Stanford University has seen fit to keep him on their faculty, so he can't be seen as wholly out to lunch.<br />At any rate, this book is certainly worth wrestling with.  Ehrlich bends over backwards, to be as conservative and non-alarmist as possible, in his writings here.  Carl Sagan, Lewis Thomas, and other contributors take the same approach.  Nevertheless, as cool-headed as they are, the underlying horror of their message is unmistakable.  Nuclear winter would be an unprecedentedly horrific experience, and there's basically zero chance that anyone reading this would survive it.  Please buy this book, get copies for all your friends, and find a way to get involved.	2002-06-01

It also includes dozens of insights into the daily life of the Narragansett tribe, at a time when most of them lived as they had from time immemorial.  Every chapter includes not only the actual vocabulary appropriate to the topic under discussion, but also several paragraphs talking about the lives of the Narragansett.  Sometimes Roger Williams ends a chapter with a little pedantic poem, but hey, cut him some slack -- he was a creature of his times, as are we all.<br />Here are a couple of things that I wish someone had told ME about, before I discovered this amazing little volume.  First and formost -- the table of contents is at the END of the book, not the beginning.  It does exist, you didn't get a defective copy.  Second -- for a funny, fascinating set of examples of early native american onomatopeia, look in the sections on \\"Fowles\\" and \\"Beastes.\\"  Evidently, the Narragansetts told Roger Williams that  they called a duck a \\"quequecum,\\" a wild goose was called a \\"honck-honck,\\"  and a horse (which they learned about from the English) was called a \\"nay-nay-oumewot.\\"  Maybe this is just my own sense of humor, but I enjoyed envisioning a stern, austere, Godly Puritan, wearing heavy black clothes in summertime (and the hat with the little buckle on front), sitting down with a solemn circle of sunburned sachems, and doing bird calls.  I can just picture the Cambridge-educated Roger Williams earnestly scribbling notes in his notebook, while the sachems sat there, pointed at birds outside the wigwam, and went \\"quack quack\\" and \\"honk honk\\" for his edification.  I thought the duck was especially funny -- \\"Ah yes....  we callum that birdum a quequecum, Good Reverend Williams.\\"<br />That is a minor point, but it does make the book a little more fun.  Basically, however, let me hasten to add that this book is far more than fun.  It is ultimately VERY serious.  It's one of the few remaining sources of information into the tongues spoken by the early natives of southern New England.  If you are capable of appreciating this, I recommend you look for anything by Kathleen Bragdon, or Ives Goddard, who have done a lot of work trying to keep the memories of these lost languages alive.  If you prefer libraries to the internet, try to find articles by the 19th century Connecticut state librarian J. Hammond Trumbull, who wrote many articles on native New England place names, and Eastern Algonquin languages in general.  You may also wish to seek out John Eliot's \\"Indian Bible,\\" which is incredibly hard to find in print, but was put on microfilm by University Microfilms in Michigan.  The \\"Indian Bible\\" was composed, with the able assistance of native speakers, in the Massachusett dialect of Algonquin, which is very closely related to Narragansett.  Another little gem is William Woods' \\"New England Prospect,\\" which includes a handy little SHORT vocabulary.  Also, if you're internet-savvy enough, you might enjoy seeking out the work of Jessie \\"Little Doe\\" Fermino, a native Wampanoag in Mashpee, Massachusetts, who has recently been developing language classes in the tongue of the Wampanoag tribe.<br />But back to this book -- it is highly informative, and a tremendous boon to students of early native Americans in New England.

That's why I got this book.  It has helped me immeasurably.  <br />I have been assisting a relative of mine, who is the director of a charter school in New England, to put together a hydroponics program for her science classes.  (Our idea has been to give her students a tiny little bit of power over their own physical well-being, in case terrorists do more evil things to our economy).  At any rate, this book is incredibly helpful to us.<br />The author of this is a Professor Emeritus at the University of Georgia.  He has decades of experience in agronomy, and in plant science in general.  He has tailored this book for a wide audience, and assumes NO prior knowledge of the topic.  He walks the reader through a very thorough, patient discussion of the value of various nutrients to a hydroponic system.  There are graphs and charts to illustrate his points, but don't be scared off!!  He makes his points quite clearly in the text.<br />After discussing the chemical basics of the topic, Professor Jones walks us through a careful comparison of the basic kinds of hydroponic set-ups.  He explains water regulation, pest control, nutrient solution distribution, and a lot of other things I would NEVER have thought of if he hadn't directed my attention to them.  There's a really good bibliography at the end, which lists a lot of related resources.<br />Basically, this book is really helpful.  One word of caution -- it's more of an overview of what you will need to know, than an actual how-to book.  If you're looking for a how-to book, try Howard Resch's titles.  Still, this book will really help fill in a lot of blanks, and help you be confident that you know what you're doing.  Two thumbs up!	2002-05-30
US	52797729	R27V3YEVFDIL0Y	0060168641	575160656	What If the Moon Didn't Exist?: Voyages to Earths That Might Have Been	Books	5	20	20	N	N	Incredibly interesting	In this book, Neil Comins walks a fascinating tightrope between science and science fiction.  He presents ten carefully detailed scenarios, in which intriguing astronomical &quot;what ifs&quot; are asked.    Each scenario is alloted about 25 or 30 pages, on average.  The title scenario, dealing with a posited Earth without a moon, is the longets essay, weighing in at 50 pages.<br />One of my favorite sections is the chapter pondering &quot;what if&quot; the Earth were struck by a black hole.  Comins generously approaches this question from two completely distinct vantage points.  First, he asks what would happen if we were hit by a stellar mass black hole.  Second, he delves into how things might be if we were hit by a primordial black hole, formed at the beginning of the universe, with a mass about the same as that of the moon.  Comins also asks great questions about how things might be if a local star went supernova; how the Earth might fare  if the Moon's orbit was closer to us; and what Earthly life might be like if the Earth were tilted on it's axis perpendicular to its orbit, like Uranus.<br />This book is really interesting.  It isn't exactly science fiction -- just speculation.  Comins sticks very close to known science, with no departures at all.  When necessary, he includes little essays about Stephen Hawking's theories, etc, to help us understand the sound foundation of his theorizing.<br />If you know any &quot;absent-minded professor&quot; children, or an adult with a bent in this direction, then I recommend the living daylights out of this book... To clarify that -- the highest praise I can give this book is that I wish I discovered it when I was about 10-13 years old.  I remember my summer vacations when I was about that age, when my friends would plant me in deep, deep, deep left field during whiffleball games.  I had to at least go out in the field, to save face, but I usually wanted to be thinking about science.  Whichever team was actually at bat,I was the designated deep-cubed left fielder for the duration of the game.  I'd sit there and daydream, and mumble to myself about astronomy or fantasy, until my friends eventually let me know when the game was over.  One summer I spent those afternoons thinking about &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;  Another summer it was Carl Sagan's &quot;Dragons of Eden&quot; (which I also recommend).   Another summer it was the science chapters from &quot;The Book of Lists.&quot;  This book would have been just as fascinating, and would have kept me happily spaced out in dreamland for months.  In my book that's high praise.  I would also recommend this for science teachers, at any level from elementary school to high school.  Two thumbs way up.	2002-05-29

For background information -- the author, Theodora Kroeber, was the wife of one of the men privileged to be Ishi's friends, Alfred Kroeber.   Dr. Alfred Kroeber was a very important American anthropologist early in this century -- a student of Franz Boas, and a parent, with Theodora, of the writer Ursula K. (for Kroeber) LeGuin.  Theodora Kroeber, at any rate, was in an excellent position to tell Ishi's story from the inside, and she does a fantastic job of it.<br />Perhaps it's significant that this, the most impactful account of Ishi, was written NOT by an anthropologist, but by an anthropologist's wife.  She was able to think simply as a non-\\"objective\\" fellow human being, and she talks about Ishi with great warmth and sympathy.  Think for a moment of what it might be like to be wholly unacquainted with even the rudest, most fundamental elements of civilization, and to need to fit in.  Ishi met this challenge, in his own time, and in his own way.  You will never forget his story.<br />I would just like to add, very quickly, that even today Ishi's story is sometimes lived out anew.  In Massachusetts, several public schools have taken in students from tiny villages in the Sudan.  These students are learning for the first time in their lives of such things as writing, money, and shoes.  Stairs, of all things, are very confusing to some of them.  I don't even want to think about what they make of such overwhelmingly powerful modern developments as the atom bomb, shopping malls, or Britney Spears.  <br />Ishi's story is timeless, yet timely for all who choose to ponder it.  This book is amazing.  One billion thumbs up.	2002-02-10
US	52797729	RFA6AY9FR1WKX	067427041X	706592761	Everyone Here Spoke Sign Language: Hereditary Deafness on Martha's Vineyard	Books	5	41	41	N	N	Inspiring and interesting	This is one of my favorite books of all time.  Originally written as an ethnographic study, it is also completely readable for a non-professional popular audience.  Basically, it is the story of the islanders of Martha's Vineyard, a large island off the coast of Massachusetts.  The islanders originally came from the same 2 or 3 boatloads of colonists from England, by way of Boston and Scituate, from a region in Kent which already seems to have had a high incidence of hereditary deafness.  Due to the geographic isolation of the island, recessive genes for deafness, which were already prominent in the original Kentish colonists, came increasingly to the fore.  As the proportions of islanders who happened to be deaf gradually increased, what was the islanders' answer?  Not shunning the deaf.  Far from it.  Rather, a  tradition arose that EVERYONE on the island, deaf or hearing, simply learned sign language as children!<br />This book is full of fascinating little anecdotes, about how island society worked to include its deaf members.  For example, we learn about families and friends, some deaf and some hearing, who would regularly sit next to each other in church.  The hearing members would sign the sermons to their deaf friends.  Or, sometimes groups of people who could hear perfectly well might be together, for whatever reason, and they might happen to converse by signing just as much as in spoken English.  Everyone spoke both languages.<br />Some of my favorite parts of the book focus on the benefits of signing.  For example, perhaps two neighbors wanted to converse, while being separated by 200 yards of noisy space, made vocally impenetrable by sounds of surf and sea.  Whether they were deaf or hearing, they could get out their spyglasses (this was a 19th century whaling community, where spyglasses were in every household) and sign to each other across the distance while viewing each other through the magnification afforded by the spyglasses.  One entertaining anecdote tells of two young men, who could hear perfectly well, who would use their signing ability to pick up girls off-island.  They would pique the girls' interest in them by signing amongst themselves, and would claim that one of them was deaf.  After they had secured the girls' interest, they would put on a lengthy, well-practiced charade of deafness to keep the gils curious about them.  Do they ever let on that they can really hear?  You'll have to read the book to find out!  Bwa ha ha haaaa ( that's the sound of an evil laugh).<br />Those are a few minor anecdotes.  The whole book is packed with stories like that, and it's endlessly amazing.  The last couple of chapters make excellent, general points about the human issues raised in the book, and about how we as a society think about the \\"handicapped\\" -- perhaps, as Dr. Groce points out, we should not use the term in the first place.<br />Anyway, I'm really pleased to call attention to this book.  I wish it were more widely known.  If you're reading this because you linked to my reviewer's page from my review of \\"Jeepers Creepers,\\" or something at a similar level, then, well, I'm just happy you're reading about this valuable story as well as \\"Jeepers Creepers.\\"  Two thumbs up.	2002-02-09

Dr. Bragdon writes not in an historical style, but rather in the ethnographic tradition.  Thus, her chapters are sometimes rather slow going unless you're an anthropologist.  There's a lot of jargon.  It's still a great read for the non-specialist, however.  I would like to recommend keeping a dictionary handy, for times when the esoteric nomenclature of anthropology becomes as impenetrable as a pre-colonial flock of passenger pigeons.<br />The book is not divided up by tribe, as one might expect.  Instead, Dr. Bragdon has divided her work by conceptual paradigms, or by umbrella descriptions of features of life shared by all the peoples of the land under discussion.  Chapters delve into cosmology, ritual, or social relations, as well as &quot;Kinship as Ideology,&quot; &quot;Metaphors and Models of Livelihood,&quot; and &quot;The Quotidian World:Work, Gender, Time, and Space.&quot;<br />By the way -- if you don't read fairly carefully at the beginning, you may miss something important.  Dr. Bragdon has chosen to employ the term &quot;Ninnimissinuok&quot; as a blanket term for members of ALL the local Algonquian tribes.  Just be aware that that what the word means -- otherwise you might waste a lot of time scratching your head, wondering who, exactly, these Ninnimissinuoks are supposed to be.  I mention this because it's not nearly so well-known a term as, for example, Narragansett, or Wampanoag -- but perhaps it should be.  The author demonstrates it's validity, and it's importance.<br />The bibliography at the end of this book is worth the book's price, all on it's own.  There's a discouragingly large amount of poorly researched, pseudo-mystical writing out there, on the subject of Native Americans.  Well, you won't find any here!  All the cited works I've tried to locate have been of an extremely high caliber.  The bibliography alone could keep you happily reading about the native peoples of Southern New England for many, many moons.<br />Again, this book can be a little steep going at times, if you aren't trained as an anthropologist, but it's worth the effort.  Definitely two thumbs up.	2002-02-06

A lot of the people who have always had the most favorable influence on humanity, I increasingly suspect, are the ones that no one ever finds out about, behind the scenes, leading good and honorable lives. It might have been nice if the author set aside a place for such people, instead of being quite so relentlessly Nietzschean in his selections.<br />At any rate, this is one of the most provocative books I've ever owned.

Have you ever, sometime in your life, by any chance, heard of the multi-multi-multi-million copy bestselling author Tom Clancy? Well, when HE wants to be entertained by thoughtful, visionary, intelligent works of fiction -- which generally feature significantly fewer gratuitous explosions than his own work -- then he turns to one of his personal favorite authors, John Varley. \\"Persistence of Vision,\\" in my humble opinion, is probably Varley's most accessible, yet amazing book.<br />The stories all feature characters in a remote future, in which everything about the human body, and everything about human society, is completely mutable and within the ability of individuals to choose for themselves. John Varley writes about sympathetic human beings, dealing with what seem to them to be fairly run-of-the-mill problems. To you or me, however, everything about the lives of these characters is simply awe-inspiring... Here you will meet lonely spacemen dwelling at the outer reaches of the solar system; sociological musings on the long-lost institution of the \\"nuclear family,\\" by future, human inhabitants of Mercury; conversations between an explorer/composer and his alien symbiote, amongst the rings of Saturn; and much, much more. The last tale in the volume, the one the book is named after, is particularly memorable. It features a man who becomes part of a colony of deaf-mute-blind people, who have developed a highly spiritual means of communicating. That story is the most profound one in this collection, but they are all stirring. I highly recommend reading \\"The Persistence of Vision.\\" Two thumbs up.	2002-01-29

I do find myself leaning in that direction, more and more, in a lot of ways -- but Buddhist beliefs are not a prerequisite for benefitting from this book.  Whether you are a Buddhist or not, there's a lot to be gained from working through the exercises included herein.  The value of this book to me, is the way it combines mindfulness with breathing.  <br />Awareness guiding the body to calm, can lead the body to reciprocally calm the mind, in an ongoing cycle.  If you wish to make this cycle part of your daily existence, this book can really help.<br />If you come to value this book, and are looking for similar techniques, ideas, etc., I would like to recommend &quot;The Quiet Mind&quot; by White Eagle, or &quot;The Relaxation Response&quot; by Dr. Herbert Benson.	2002-01-29

I would just like to add a few small points.<br />A reader might have trouble finding Kathleen Bragdon's other, related publication, based on the way the earlier reviewer described it. The correct title of that book is \\"Native People of Southern New England, 1500-1650.\\" It is very interesting, and it greatly expands the information given in the volume that I'm primarily discussing here.<br />Another point, which I feel prospective buyers might wish to be aware of, is that \\"Native Writings in Massachusett\\" is composed almost entirely of historical minutiae. What I mean by this is that most of the documents here are of extremely slight historical import. Don't expect major treaties, or folk literature. The writings here are fascinating precisely because of their pedestrian, mundane, quotidian nature. They include marriage vows, marginalia from old bibles, personal wills, or land deeds (an issue of overwhelming significance, to be sure, but the actual documents here tend to be of very small transactions). There are about 150 of these short documents. In every case, we first see a xerox of the original, almost always handwritten document, which is usually very faded and difficult to read. There follows a transcription of the Massachusett text. Next, there is a translation into English, or an effort to translate. Sometimes there are words that no one understands anymore...  <br />Volume two is basically a guide to the grammar of the language.  Be warned, volume two is written for trained linguists, so it can be difficult to make your way through the pages.  There's a lot of linguistics jargon.  It isn't like a Berlitz book.  Still, I think you should give it a shot -- it's more than worth it.  If you need help with the linguistics terminology, try using \\"A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics,\\" by David Crystal<br />Beyond these issues, the other reviewer has already made all the salient points, in my opinion. I would just like to add that it really is an amazing experience to leaf through this book. If you live in Eastern Massachusetts, or went to school there, this book has serious potential to enrich your library, and your mind. I grew up mostly in Massachusetts, and I remember always being curious about some of the odd names of places I would hear. Places like Lake Hocomoc, Mount Wachusett, Lake Quinebequin, Lake Quinsigamond, the place called Mishawum... As a child I used to wonder if maybe some of these odd words were perhaps Irish in origin, at least the names of the lakes, as I had friends with the last name Quinn and knew this word to be Irish. Of course, the Irish came to Massachusetts far too late to play a major role in the naming of places. The words that so many of us find to be enthralling are, in fact, of the ancient Massachusett tongue.  Today, this tongue is very difficult to find examples of.<br />It may seem odd to devote attention to the tongue that was spoken in Massachusetts for so long, before the arrival of English.  I hope you try to confront this feeling of oddness, and face it down.  This book evokes a certain wrenching of one's customary paradigm, when one thinks of the copper-colored folk who lived in Massachusetts for innumerable cycles of years, fishing and hunting, working and playing, living and loving, before the arrival of the English. This book helps you to feel that once Massachusetts was just a place like any other, with no broader significance in the worlds of politics, science, or education. Today the ancient Massachusett tribe exists only in the Ponkapoag band, spread out across many neighborhoods in towns to the south of Boston. Their language is preserved in these magical pages.  In fact, this very book has helped a member of the nearby, more populous Mashpee Wampanoag tribe, Jessie \\"Little Doe\\" Fermino, to revitalize the almost identical lost Wampanoag tongue.<br />If you'd like to show some interest and respect for the people who walked the paths, fished the rivers, and knew the forests of Eastern Massachusetts for unknown centuries before our current civilization came into being, you could do worse than to purchase these books. I'd also like to strongly recommend that you alert your local library to its existence.	2002-01-26
US	52797729	R2RET8M2E3HD8X	0879190949	873626996	Archaeoastronomy in the Americas (Ballena Press Anthropological Papers)	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Provokes A Pleasantly Concatenated Sense of Wonder	This book is really terrific.  I think that for many of us, &quot;wonder,&quot; and a sense of personal contact with grand mysteries, are best experienced through either astronomy or archaeology.  What I mean by that is that both of these topics necessitate a personal confrontation with the unknown.  The origin of the universe; the fate of ancient peoples; the mythic architecture of dreams uponst which olden folk drew, to explain their place in the cosmos...  if these topics don't give you at least a slight frisson of wonder, then, face it, you're hopeless.<br />This book provides a concatenated sense of wonder by drawing upon both archaeology and astronomy, and distilling many of the most provocative questions explored in each topic.  Added to these topics is a tincture of anthropology, which in my mind solidifies the claim that this book has to true neato-hood.  <br />The focus is on the Western Hemisphere, as the title states.  The book starts out with a collection of essays by respected, authentic scholars who study this kind of thing.  Essay topics include &quot;Archaeoastronomy Today,&quot; &quot;Archaeoastronomy and Education,&quot; &quot;The Role of Architecture and Planning in Archaeoastronomy,&quot; and various and sundry allied topics.  If you have a longstanding interest in this kind of thing, you might expect the book to spend a lot of time on the Mayans, because of all the work done on Mayan calendrics, etc.  Well, true, there's a lot about the Mayans, but there's also plentiful material about peoples without written records, such as the Chumash, the Apache, some Algonquin tribes, etc.<br />Let me just point out that the people who contributed to this volume are all respected scholars -- there are no von Danikens, no Velikovskies, no Stichins to call the whole book into question with wild claims about pre-historic extraterrestrial contact, or the like.  This book is for real.<br />The body of the book, like the introduction, is divided into essays by academics with backgrounds in the appropriate fields.  The essays are broken up into geographical regions -- North America, Mesoamerica, and South America.  Essays delve into all kinds of fascinating subtopics about many archaeoastronomical questions.  There is a little essay at the end, about prospects for teaching archaeoastronomy in the classroom.  This essay is over twenty years old now, but it still has much of relevance to say.<br />If you enjoy this kind of thing, you may wish to know about the &quot;Journal of Archaeoastronomy,&quot; which you can find either online or in &quot;Magazines for Libraries.&quot;  Also, you can't go wrong reading anything at all by Anthony Aveni.  Anyway, this book is a lot of fun.  I would recommend it to anyone.	2002-01-20

I think some people might be turned off, or made suspicious, by the somewhat lurid cover, but please don't be among those people.  The book is highly lucid, extremely intelligent, and absolutely terrifying.<br />Dr. Verschuur is a well-respected astronomer, and clearly one of the reasons that he is so highly respected, is his facility for communicating complex information in an understandable way.  In this book, he carefully walks the reader through logically presented discussions of the dinosaur-killing asteroid; the tsunamis (huge ocean waves) that would result from an asteroid landing in the sea; the history of the way scientists have thought about the threat of asteroids; and the statistical likelihood that you or I will be slain by an errant asteroid (about 1 in 20,000, which is approximately the same as the chance of dying in a plane crash).  While, admittedly, current efforts to prevent plane crashes are stepped up from the norm, doesn't it seem as though we should be taking vastly greater precautions to detect near-Earth asteroids which could destroy civilization???<br />Dr. Vershuur's account of this threat is very level-headed, and perceptively written.  He asks why so many of us have trouble psychologically, conceptualizing the reality of this threat.  He also deals, cautiously, with the possibility that ancient legends from around the world may actually tell of asteroid strikes in pre-historic times.  This is brave of him to even mention this kind of thing, because it verges on speculation.  Scientists are not in the business of irresponsible speculation, after all -- their business is science!  They risk grave professional consequences, if they even attempt to discuss such issues.  But Dr. Verschuur is very good about alerting the reader to the controversial nature of efforts to extract scientific meaning from the ore of myth.  Anyway, he touches on the topic, and it is sometimes interestingly plausible, to my mind at least.<br />Probably the best thing about this book, is that it helps to alleviate the almost religious terror that the prospect of such collisions produce in most of us.  Think of the movie &quot;Armageddon.&quot;  What a calm, objective, dispassionately conceived title for a movie --  NOT!  That movie makes us think about asteroid strikes as a highly infrequent, totally overwhelming event that only Bruce Willis would be able to handle (ha ha).  Dr. Verschuur's book, on the other hand, helps us to see that the Earth gets hit CONSTANTLY by asteroids, and it's just a question of understanding the frequency with which we get nailed by the bigger ones.<br />We learn here that, for example, the Earth gets hit by an asteroid large enough to disrupt a global civilization approximately once every 5,000 years.  That's APPROXIMATELY.  It can vary by thousands of years.  This is just the statistical likelihood, averaged out over millions of years by analyzing the age of craters on Earth, nearby planets, and the moon.  We learn that an asteroid with a diameter of 500 meters would probably destroy civilization, and that one that was over 1,000 meters would result in the death of virtually the entire world population of humans.  For perspective, the one that finally killed the dinosaurs was about 10,000 meters across.  Asteroids that big are rare -- but some are even bigger.<br />Most asteroids are not quite this threatening, but none are benign.  Dr. Vershuur's book really helps us to understand things that more people should be thinking about.  My only problem with this book is that I wish it included an appendix of ideas that people should try to implement, as precautionary measures.  One example that IS included is the importance of giving money to the (very few) institutions that watch the skies.  However, I would like to see a book like this also mention promoting educational initiatives that encourage highly localized electricalpower generation options, such as wind energy, in case our global economy is suddenly obliterated.  Most importantly, I wish there were a section stressing the importance of learning to grow FOOD in hydroponic, protected, indoor environments, so people would have renewable food supplies if a sudden winter, lasting for years, were brought on by all the dust an asteroid strike would throw up into the sky.  No country on Earth has more than a few months of food stored up at any given time.  If a major asteroid strike provoked a &quot;nuclear winter&quot; type of scenario, virtually everyone who survived would starve, without precautionary measures.<br />Still, basically this book is simply fantastic.  Definitely two thumbs up.	2002-01-15
US	52797729	R2T44YH0X6RWDH	0805917004	228372858	Oxford and his Elizabethan ladies	Books	5	7	7	N	N	I like the idea of Shakespeare secretly being an Ed	The reason for the existence of this book is the fascinating theory that William Shakespeare didn't really write &quot;Shakespeare's&quot; plays.  The theory is that they were mostly written by a man named Edward de Vere, who was the contemporary Earl of Oxford.  Like most such ideas, this theory is considered &quot;controversial&quot; by those who believe it, and &quot;a lot of hooey&quot; by those who don't.  Eleanor Brewster's interesting book takes the position that the theory is in fact true, and she marshalls an endlessly tantalizing array of known facts, about the women who figured prominently in Edward de Vere's life, to support her contention.  She argues that these known, historical, female figures provided the source material for many of the women in &quot;Shakespeare's&quot; plays.  She is able to assemble a great deal of material to support her ideas, because most of these women lived some of the most thoroughly documented lives of their time.  This is the case because they were considered to be at the very pinnacle of Elizabethan society -- indeed, Queen Elizabeth herself is accorded one of the most interesting chapters in the book.  As this theory gains ground in our universities, as I personally believe that it is destined to do, Eleanor Brewster's innovative book can provide a fascinating window into the problem.  After all, what greater source of inspiration does any creative person have, than the women in their life???  That would be... none.<br />This book is laid out as follows.  First, there is a helpful introduction, which lays out Brewster's essential claims.  She provides useful, carefully compiled information here, to suitably prepare the minds of readers who may not be conversant with the basic de Vere theory.  Don't skip the introduction, if you aren't a de Vere buff.  It also provides information to help the reader visualize the setting of the Elizabethan period.<br />After the introduction, Brewster walks us through careful descriptionsof the lives, and personae, of the women in de Vere's life.  We learn about his mother; his sister; his unhappy first wife; Queen Elizabeth; his mistress; his second wife; and his daughters.  Each person is given a chapter, and we see over and over again the range of references in &quot;Shakespeare's&quot; plays which seem to refer to these women.  It's usually pretty convincing, frankly.  Now and then I feel like Brewster might be reaching a little, in her enthusiasm over the topic, but not often.  She does a lot of very impressive detective work here.<br />The book concludes with sections about Shakespeare's First Folio, and with some issues raised by the known portraits of Shakespeare and of de Vere.  There is a very useful bibliography for further reading.  Also, each chapter concludes with a subject-specific bibliography, which is often quite useful.<br />People who are interested in this subject need to know about the original book that put forward the basic theory.  This book was &quot;Shakespeare&quot; Identified as the Seventeenth Earl of Oxford,&quot; by J. Thomas Looney, published in 1920.  Please don't be too put off by Looney's last name (ha ha) -- his ideas are sane, lucid, and compelling.  This idea is sort of depressing to me in many ways -- one likes to think of Shakespeare as an untutor'd genius who simply made up all the plays based on trips to a local library of some kind.  Well, for examples of that kind of genius, there are always scientific geniuses like Ben Franklin, Einstein, or Edison!  Sadly, Eleanor Brewster has convinced me that Shakespeare can't be counted among their ranks.  Oh well.  This is still a great book, however, and I give it two thumbs up.	2002-01-14

There are others that perform the same task, (notably Kenneth Katzner's &quot;Languages of the World,&quot; which includes far more languages and examples of scripts.)  However, for some reason this book has it's own magic. <br />It contains excerpts from newspapers in 29 different scripts, from all over the world.  They are classified by geographical region.  The phonetic value of the symbols are helpfully assessed for the reader, in alphabetic charts which accompany each selection.  Each script shown is prefaced by a short paragraph explaining the history and development of that script.<br />Don't miss the especially cool litle section at the end of each geographical collection.  There is a section of &quot;Other Scripts in West Asia,&quot; &quot;Other Scripts in Africa,&quot; &quot;Other Scripts in the Americas and Oceania,&quot; etc.  These selections are not in newspaper format, but are given as short excerpts from whatever the original source may have been.  Examples include the Easter Island script, Sumerian cuneiform, and the script of the Indus Valley civilization.<br />Basically this book is a lot of fun, and it really opens the mind to a sense of wonder.  I highly recommend it for anyone.	2001-12-20

I have been reading and re-reading this little booklet for several weeks, and it's quite helpful...  There's something embarrassing about purchasing a &quot;book&quot; on such a basic topic.  Therefore, I recommend thinking of this as a &quot;booklet,&quot; which it really is, anyway, at under 100 pages.<br />The layout is as follows.  First, there's a handy little &quot;Introduction to Arabic,&quot; which warns the reader about such curious features of the language as a lack of clear distinction between nouns and adjectives.  Arabic, evidently, has many such linguistic features, which are somewhat off-putting to a Western reader.  I have been lucky enough to have taken a couple of linguistics courses, which made this brief chapter a little easier for me to get through.

The next chapter is a sixteen page overview of the alphabet, giving the reader useful tips about how to pronounce, and memorize, the various letters.  This chapter only gives the &quot;initial&quot; and &quot;isolated&quot; forms of each letter -- most Arabic letters change their appearance if they are in the middle of a word, or at it's end.  The third chapter goes into more depth, and shows the &quot;medial&quot; and &quot;final&quot; forms of each letter.  At the end there are some recommendations for further study; a verse from the Qu'ran for you to wrestle with; some notes about handwriting; a quick table of the alphabet for ready reference (bookmark this)!; and a map of the Arabic speaking world, with all the countries labelled in Arabic.<br />I like this booklet.  It's inexpensive, and I think it's a good way to make the Arabic script less exotic and intimidating.  If you decide to continue beyond this, let me just mention that I've asked around at several of Boston's numerous universities, and many of them seem to use the book &quot;Elementary Modern Standard Arabic,&quot; by Peter Abboud and Ernest McCarus, published by Cambridge University Press.  I am not going to pass myself off as an expert, however -- do some comparison shopping on your own, and see what you think.<br />All in all, this is a very nice idea for a booklet.  Two thumbs up.	2001-12-19

In &quot;Cat's Cradle,&quot; Kurt Vonnegut tells us everything we ever wanted to know, but were afraid to ask, about foma, ice-nine, and Bokononism.  In the telling, he leaves us mesmerized with his sadly warm, warmly sad vision of mankind, and of mankind's pathetic proclivity for trying so hard to believe in known lies, and in unknown truths.<br />The story is told by Jonah, who is researching the life and times of a great physicist, Dr. Hoenikker.  Hoenikker is one of the more prominent fathers of the atomic bomb, yet he has an image of being a childlike, saintly figure who lived his life enraptured by the cerebral, celestial music of the spheres.  He may or may not have been a saint, (this is never fully resolved,) but he definitely was directly responsible, in this book, for at least two devices which are foolproof, sure-fire, results-guaranteed means of totally annihilating all life on this planet.  Doesn't sound much like a saint, you say?!?!?  Well, all I can say is, you need to read this book.<br />As the story unfolds, we meet Hoenikker's scared, lonely, grown children, whose fates are locked together by the terrible secret of ice-nine.  Jonah travels with them to the little-known, Caribbean island republic of San Lorenzo for his research.  Once there, he discovers the bizarrely sensible religion of Bokononism, and his life is changed forever.<br />&quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; is crammed with a curiously concatenated cornucopia of consistently compelling creative conundrums.  A word of warning: you may want to wear some kind of metal helmet while reading this book.  Otherwise, you will risk scratching a hole in your skull from scratching your head all the time, trying to understand all the brilliant ideas in this book.  There are just tons of insights into how we interpret reality, how we interpret fiction, and how we sometimes do the second of those activities, when we should be doing the first...  One character is a professional book indexer.  She goes through manuscripts of books for a living, and creates indexes for them.  Sounds like kind of an odd profession, eh?  Well then, how do YOU break down dreams, or reality, to make them easier to cope with?  What's YOUR strategy for this basic human need?  Or, for another example -- another character is one of Dr. Hoenikker's grown sons.  He was called &quot;Secret Agent X-9&quot; as a child, because he happened to have a few fairly furtive mannerisms.  As an adult, he basically lives a James Bond life, making or breaking kings, and consorting with beautiful women on a lush, island paradise.  Did his dreamlike adult reality grow out of the real nightmare he lived out as a mocked child?  Where did one start, and the other stop?  This is the kind of question that Kurt Vonnegut raises in this book.  Every sentence has meaning.  Just amazing.  An infinite number of thumbs up.	2001-11-29
US	52797729	R32TZ0K92P68FQ	812150516X	336998309	Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms	Books	4	24	24	N	N	Slow going, but very interesting	This book is a travelogue, compiled by a medieval Chinese monk named Fa-Hien, who travelled through Central Asia and India, and ultimately to Sri Lanka, in about the years 399 to 414 A.D.  I only know this from reading the back of the book, but evidently it's one of the principal sources of information today, for people who want to learn about ancient/medieval Indian Buddhism.<br />The author's journey took him through the outlying regions of Tibet, and then through what today is Afghanistan, Pakistan, northern India, and Sri Lanka.  Throughout the narrative, he tells stories about local variations on Buddhist practice, such as festivals, rituals, folklore about legendary visits by the Buddha, and the like.  This is what you should read this book for.  There are a lot of names and terms to cope with, so be prepared for that.  You may want to make a policy of reading through this book one chapter at a time, fairly quickly, just to get the gist of some of the legends.  Then you can always go back later to fill in your knowledge of all the exotic names, if you want.<br />Three side notes to be aware of...  When Fa-Hien travels through Khotan, in China, you may want to know that he was among a group of people descended from the pre-historic Indo-Europeans.  These people were known as the Tocharians, if you want to do any research on them online.  Their words for father and mother, for example, were the very Indo-European &quot;pacer&quot; and &quot;macer,&quot; which we can see are almost identical to the Latin &quot;pater&quot; and &quot;mater.&quot;   Tapestries and old paintings show us that some of the Tocharians were born with  red hair -- in China!  Also, it's very interesting to read an account of travelling in  Peshawar, which we hear about every day on the news these days, from a time two full centuries before Islam even existed!  In Fa-Hien's time, Peshawar was Buddhist, and had some of the most magnificent Buddhist shrines in all of the Indian subcontinentalregion.  He writes about some legends behind the shrines, and about the practices of the local monks.  Finally, for another somewhat familiar point of reference, watch for what Fa-Hien has to say about Gandhara.  Gandhara is a region in northern Pakistan that was once heavily settled and influenced by soldiers of Alexander the Great, about seven hundred years before Fa-Hien passed through.  Even today, ancient Gandharan artwork is renowned for combining Buddhist and Greek elements...  Actually, the footnotes in this section are a better source of information about Gandhara than what Fa-Hien says, but hey, it's all in there.<br />To provide context for this book, it is good to ask what was happening in the rest of the world, at this period.  Well, the Roman Empire had only recently (in 380 A.D.) made Christianity its official religion.  So, plenty of people who were alive at this time could remember when Rome was still pagan...  St. Augustine wrote his blockbuster, smash hit bestseller &quot;The City of God&quot; in 411 A.D.  The Roman legions in Great Britain were called home to Rome during this time, in 410 A.D., to help defend Rome against Visigothic invasions.  Great Britain, therefore, was basically entirely Celtic.  England was not &quot;England&quot; yet in any sense, because the Angles and Saxons didn't even begin invading it until (this is the date given in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;) 449 A.D.  Similarly, France would never have been called &quot;France&quot; at this time, because the tribe it is named after, the Franks, didn't invade it until 418 A.D.  In America, this period was right around the beginning of the Mississippi Valley culture.<br />At any rate, I only gave this book four stars because it's kind of slow going, with all the funny names.  But it's very worth it.  Two thumbs up!	2001-10-31

The book is named after one of the stories.  The other two are called &quot;The Doum Tree of Wad Hamid,&quot; and &quot;A Handful of Dates.&quot;  Each tale has the universal feel of a fable -- the wisdom they encode in their simple language can speak to anyone, anywhere, anytime.  The Muslim characters have a few traits which could seem odd to Western readers, but basically they are just like small town folks all over the world.  They walk with  dignity, they live in peace amidst old friends and loved ones, and they cherish their own dreams of love and happiness.<br />The title story is my favorite.  Zein is sort of a &quot;holy fool&quot; in his little village.  He is not exactly retarded, or crazy, but is clearly eccentric.  He seems to promote laughter and good feelings wherever he goes, although sometimes this is at his own expense.  Many of the villagers laugh at him.  All of the villagers laugh with him.  Zein seems unaware that there could be a distinction between these groups of people, and, perhaps, therein lies his potential for healing...  He is betrothed to the beautiful, solemn, almond-eyed Ni'ma, before whom he has NEVER made a fool of himself.  She, and she alone, holds this honor...  Their courtship, and the impact it has upon the village, comprises a highly provocative, and ultimately warm, view into human nature.  You won't forget this comedic, yet highly serious, love story.<br />Taken together, these stories really got me thinking about what it's like to live in an average Muslim village.  It makes me want to know these people better, they're just like us. <br />Considering that these stories take place specifically in the Sudan, where Osama bin Laden and his confederates camped for a few years, I couldn't help but think of any Sudanese soldiers he may have picked up there.  These stories show the homey,happy, sunny, rural village scenes that those soldiers are homesick for right now, as they batten down the hatches in store for a long, brutal Afghani winter.  Can't you just picture them, hiding in their freezing caves, listening to the Arabic equivalent of &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; on their black market Sony Walkmen, dreaming of happier times back home?  These stories make me understand that they were just PEOPLE before becoming terrorists...  I can just imagine some scared former Sudanese villager, in a camp in Afghanistan, praying like people who have monumentally goofed up their lives have always prayed, and will always pray...  &quot;Oh God, please just get me out of this mess, and I promise I'll go to the mosque more often...  I promise I'll stop making fun of the funny way my dumb brother-in-law Ahmed fastens his turban...  I promise I'll stop procrastinating on making that pilgramage to Mecca...  just get me out of this war, that's all I ask.&quot;<br />At any rate, I felt obliged to say all that because it's October, 2001.  But these timeless stories are simply superb, and worth owning for their own sake.  Two thumbs up.	2001-10-30

This was after Einstein's first papers on relativity were published, but long before the idea of the &quot;Big Bang&quot; was a hot topic.  Astronomy has progressed a lot since 1919.  So, the author makes occasional statements about astronomy that will rest uneasily in the mind of the alert reader.  Also -- social science in general was a very different scene in 1919 than it is today, so be prepared for some statements you may actually find offensive.<br />That said, the writing style is pleasantly, rollingly Edwardian, reminiscent of Saki or Olaf Stapledon, and the book is packed with intriguing notions.  In Chaucer's day, astronomy and astrology were not differentiated, so let's just say the science isn't always overwhelmingly hardcore.  Nevertheless, Chaucer was apparently considered an expert with the medieval astrolabe, so he did have things to say that were actually cutting-edge science in the 14th century.<br />The book is divided into four sections, dealing with I.)Astronomy in the Middle Ages, II.)Chaucer's Scientific Knowledge, III.)Chaucer's Cosmology, IV.)Chaucer's Astronomy, and finally V.)Astronomical Lore in Chaucer.  The actual quotes don't really kick in until chapter two.  There are many entertaining, illuminating little passages sprinkled throughout this highly neato book.  All you need to be wary of is the fact that the book is a little out of date, and then you can relax and enjoy it.  Two thumbs up.	2001-10-23

Breton has created an unusual, very helpful reference source.  By &quot;South Asia,&quot; the author (and, evidently, scholarly consensus) refers to the region including Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepan, Bhutan, and the borders of Tibet and Nepal.  (Considering that it is the autumn of 2001, I am probably not remiss in pointing out that chapter 6 includes some useful material on the region's hotspots, and &quot;hot&quot; languages and ethnicities, including the Pushtun, Kashmiri, and Urdu-speaking peoples.)<br />The Atlas is divided into two main sections, followed by a series  of tables, charts, and bibliographies.  The first section is a generalized presentation of the languages and ethnic communities of south Asia.  This section has no maps or tables, but seeks to prepare the reader for what follows with a series of essays.  The essays concern, for example, the subcontinent's linguistic potpourri as being a fascinating sociological laboratory for viewing the collision, and collusion, of a multiplicity of tongues and folkways.  Other essays include a survey of the historical and pre-historical background behind this hodgepodge of tongues, and a series of linked essays connecting language to race, tribe, caste, and religion.<br />The second section includes the actual maps, which are not in color.  There are sixty of them.  This section opens with two brief chapters of further introoductory material, and then the maps begin with chapter 6.  From chapter 6 through chapter 10, the region is divided into 5 geographical sub-regions, each of which is tackled in turn with a combination of maps and explicatory essays.  To take chapter 6 as a representative example -- this chapter opens with a map dealing with a region we are only too familiar with today, the Pakistani-Afghan border.  The accompanying texxt to this map helps us to understand the local tongues as being either Indo-European, in the case of Baluchi and Pushto (AKA Pashto, or Pushtun), or as being the more ancient, indigenous Dravidian tongue Brahui.  Brahui, in an interesting sidenote, is mentioned as one of the stronger candidates for being the descendant language of the language spoken by the Indus Valley civilization, of pre-historic times.  The speakers are discussed in terms of their ethnic, religious, and geographic background...  Next, also in chapter 6, there are 3 more maps of regions in and around Pakistan and Kashmir, with accompanying text that performs a similar function to the text with the first map.<br />After the various regions of the subcontinent have been gone into in great detail, we are presented with 4 more chapters which deal with, respectively, non-regional languages such as English or other lingua franca;  the impact of the media and of modern cities; ethno-linguistic political issues germane to the subcontinent; and finally a chapter drawing upon a 1990s census to make sense of much of the data presented.  The book closes with a selection of helpful tables and charts, and an outstanding bibliography.<br />This atlas is an unusual idea, and it is executed in a comprehensive way.  Linguistic terminology, in general, is kept to a minimum.  Chances are, if you can operate a computer ably enough to get to this review, you could take away something of value from &quot;Atlas of the Languages and Ethnic Communities of South Asia.&quot;  Two thumbs up.	2001-10-20
US	52797729	R2N1BGUYDNLGEI	0810827859	92747741	Peaceful Peoples	Books	5	3	3	N	N	What a nice idea for a book!	In &quot;Peaceful Peoples: An Annotated Bibliography,&quot; Bruce Bonta has created a reference source which calls attention to societies which, by their very nature, tend to be quiet, obscure, and little-known.  It makes the reader think about the wistful paradox that those people, and those peoples, who are always the most worth knowing, are so often the least well-known, simply because they never &quot;get in anyone's face,&quot; so to speak.  Their peacefulness, oftentimes, can confer upon them a certain social invisibility.<br />Mr. Bonta includes a useful little introduction, which should not be skipped over.  In it, he talks a bit about his own motivations for compiling this book, e.g., offering an alternative to the mindset encouraged by some of the writings of Konrad Lorenz; he tries to articulate the book's specific research value to peace activists, or to scholars of any kind; he defines the terms he employs (very simply and straightforwardly); and he talks a little about the criteria he employs for including any given people, and for including any particular reference source.<br />In the body of the book, he focuses upon 47 disparate peoples from around the globe, who, for one reason or another, can be considered to be unusually unwarlike.   The reference materials compiled range from anthropological writings, to sociology, to social psychology, to &quot;pure&quot; histories.  Each of the 47 sections begins with a paragraph about the people in question, in which they are placed in a geographical and historical context.  Then, for each people, anywhere from 5 to 25 reference sources are offered for the reader to seek out on his or her own.  Each reference source is carefully and usefully annotated.  Usually, there are about 2 books discussed per page.<br />The peoples we learn about here include, among many others, the Amish, the Balinese, the !Kung, the Quakers, the Tahitians, and the Zapotec.  The Tasaday are NOT included.  The real value of this book is in calling attention to these peoples -- once you've made a decision to think about them, it is up to you not to romanticise them, but to simply see them as they are, without rose-colored glasses.  They're just people, just like you.<br />A great idea for a book.  Two thumbs up.	2001-10-11

There are occasionally some small errors, and there is a tendency to be overly dramatic, I think.  The plain facts are scary enough -- histrionics are unecessary.  I suppose, however, that their intent is to galvanize the public into demanding more proactive, comprehensive programs of pre-emptive action from our national leaders and policy-makers.  I hope they are successful.  I know that I, for one, would be perfectly happy to go without a few civil liberties for awhile if it meant increased protection against the horrendous, nightmarish scenarios described in this book.<br />I recommend ordering this, and if you can find a copy, seek it out in your local library while you're waiting for the publishers to print up a few million more copies.  Also -- if the kinds of events portrayed in this book occur, one of the very few ways that we'll be able to protect ourselves to ANY extent is by trying to grow at least some of our own vegetables, in the safety of our own homes.  At least this way people will have SOME insurance, some security, in that the food they serve their kids will not have been exposed to any unknown contaminants.  There is a way to do this, even in the dead of winter.  It's called \\"hydroponics,\\" and it has been an evolving technology since the 1930s.  Amazon.com sells several books on this topic.  I would like to recommend \\"Hydroponic Home Food Gardens\\" by Howard M. Resh.  Also, \\"Beginning Hydroponics or Soilless Gardening: A Beginner's Guide to Growing Vegetables, House Plants, Flowers, and Herbs Without Soil\\" by Richard E. Nicholls, is quite useful.	2001-10-10

Eric Dodds' masterpiece &quot;The Greeks and the Irrational&quot; is an interestingly subversive work.  In it, the author uses the methodologies and tools of anthropology and psychology to show that the Ancient Greeks, far from being the paragons of rational thought that we are so often told to revere, were in fact at least as beset by little-understood internal sub-rational or irrational forces as, for example, Franz Kafka or Humbert Humbert.  Please realize that this book was written in the 1950s, so a lot of the anthropological and psychological jargon is very outdated, and often even offensive in today's climate...  Scrolling down this page, I notice several people from South America have contributed their reviews of this book.  This is probably not insignificant.  I once saw Carlos Fuentes speak, and he talked quite a bit about the way that, under fascist regimes in South America, many national educational systems have often been encouraged by their governments to put forward Sparta, as opposed to Athens, as a model of the great virtue of the Greeks.  Such models of government, of course, favor the fascists and entrenched power in general.  Face it, those Greeks have power!  If you can invoke the spirit of Pericles, Plato, or even Draco, in an essay or assembly, you can feel some confidence that your words will be hearkened unto all the more attentively.  <br />I mentioned Draco in that last paragraph for a reason.  In  post-September 11 America, you can bet that the nation's right-wingers, along the lines of Podhoretz, the Kristols, and the like, are saying amongst themselves &quot;this is our time!  Our hour has come!&quot;  There are going to be a lot of very powerful forces in our society in the coming months and years, pushing us ever rightward.  I personally feel that this is probably necessary in the short run -- our fantastic civil liberties are the single best thing about our country, but this is not the world of 1776, or even 1968.  It may, in fact, prove to be more like the world of 1349, during the Black Death, if bio-terrorism really takes off.  At any rate, we will probably see a shift to the right in our political culture, for security's sake.  Perhaps this is acceptable.  The real problems will arise later, when the right wing ideologues are going to try to hold onto their newfound power.  Traditionally, such people have always been drawn to the arguments of the deadest, whitest dead white males they could come up with, who of course include many Ancient Greeks among their numbers.  When these ideologues begin to spout such arguments, which I believe is inevitable, books like &quot;The Greeks and the Irrational&quot; will be very valuable reading in our universities, as a way of breaking their power over the minds of our students.<br />So, if you're smart, you should look to the future by looking to the past, and buy yourself a copy of &quot;The Greeks and the Irrational.&quot;  Two thumbs up.	2001-10-09
US	52797729	RAPVBSBLBQ3IL	0812511921	192988021	Alternate Presidents (Alternate Anthologies)	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Engrossing and unusual	&quot;Alternate Presidents&quot; is part of Mike Resnick's series of alternate history anthologies, which also includes &quot;Alternate Warriors&quot; and &quot;Alternate Kennedies.&quot;  On the whole, this anthology has less of a tendency to lapse from &quot;true&quot; alternate history into sheer fantasy than some of the other volumes.  It does do this on occasion -- e.g., Robert Sheckley's hilarious vignette about President Dukakis being taken by a mysterious secret service agent to meet our true, behind-the-scenes alien overlords in a bunker in New Mexico, or Laura Resnick's story in which a woman was elected president in 1872 (a comparably unlikely scenario, in my humble opinion).  However, by and large, these stories are genuine alternate history, which make you think about the forces at work in peoples' minds and hearts at various eras in our past, and how these forces could have played out if certain changes had occurred.<br />A couple of my favorite tales include Lawrence Watt-Evans' &quot;Truth, Justice, and the American Way,&quot; about a horrifyingly right-wing world in which FDR never took the helm of America; &quot;Fellow Americans&quot; by Eileen Gunn, in which Goldwater won in 1964, and ended up using &quot;small-scale&quot; tactical nuclear weapons in Vietnam, and in which, for comic relief, Nixon mellowed out in the 60s to the point where he morphed into a hot-tubbing, LSD-experimenting, wildly successful comedic game show host in the 90s.<br />I think this volume is a really great idea.  Most of the stories in it do have the effect of compelling the reader to hit the books, and learn more about the background of each tale.  You just want to feel like you really &quot;get&quot; the context of each story.  If you are a history teacher, or know one, I'd like to suggest this volume as a fantastic teaching tool!  It makes history entertaining, by forcing the reader to really think about the cause and effect of events, and to try to extrapolate (that magic word behind all good science fiction -- extrapolate) plausible outcomes of certain scenarios.  For example, I remember hearing about a survey that indicated that something like 15% or 20% of graduating American high school seniors were not sure who won the Civil War, or even who the combatants were.  If those kids were exposed to fantastic tales like these, I guarantee that this would not be the case...  Even if you just made a handout out of one or two of these stories, the students would really benefit from the discussions you could have.  <br />So much of science fiction, or &quot;speculative fiction,&quot; as this should perhaps be called, takes place in the future.  This volume, and the whole sub-genre of alternate history, shows that it can be perhaps even more educational, and at least as interesting, (albeit without the additional value of getting readers to think about things that really might happen someday) to set this kind of tale in the past.  My only reason for not giving this book 5 stars is that some of the stories, as I mentioned, are a little too much like fantasy, and not realistic enough.  Most of these stories are great, however.  Worth finding a copy.	2001-10-09

Before this book, you probably would have needed to be a graduate student in history before you even realized that the Arab point of view of the Crusades had ever even been recorded, let alone preserved.  This book strikes a beautiful balance between being a purely popular edition, and being something that people who study stuff like this for a living might read...  It's the kind of book that Barbara Tuchman might have been proud to write.<br />Amin Maalouf specifically disavows any intention to write a &quot;history book&quot; in his preface.  His background is in journalism, and sure enough, he shows evidence of a journalist's ear and eye for the great story... for the gripping and/or galvanizing detail... for the telling gesture that provides the key to a character's persona.  Furthermore, he makes it plain that he is not out to write a balanced account, any more than Western authors have historically been interested in providing balanced accounts of the Crusades.  This really is presented from the Arab point of view... That said, it might be worth balancing your reading of this book with a concurrent reading of a western account, or you might get a little lost.  It isn't easy to read a long book with so few familiar points of reference.  Admit it -- unless you are a major history buff, you probably don't know much about this period even from the Western point of view!  I think especially as Americans, there is a tendency to feel that this period in history is not very relevant to our country's history.  After all, the events of this book took place long before nationalism, before (clearly) freedom of religion or of speech, mostly even before the Magna Carta was a glimmer in anyone's eye.  It's hard for us Americans to really relate to this period -- our whole country was essentially created in reaction to it!  In a funny way, this book fits in well with that feeling of being alienated -- Europeans of the time of the Crusades wereevery bit as alien to us, in terms of their mindset, as they would have been to the Muslims of that time.<br />Let me offer a few thoughts.  The whole text is sprinkled throughout with Arabic terms, which are helpfully explained in a glossary at the end.  The glossary is only 2 or 3 pages long.  You should xerox it, and keep the xerox handy while you're reading, or you might go mad from turning back and forth to the end of the book all the time.  Also -- there ARE maps in this book.  They aren't mentioned in the table of contents, and they're sort of tucked away obscurely, but they are in there.  There's a fairly localized map of the eastern shores of the Mediterranean at the very beginning of the book, and a larger-scale map of the Islamic world in general, tucked in at the book's end...  Also, don't miss Maalouf's great epilogue, where he tries to place the Crusades in context, in terms of their impact on Europe, and on the Islamic world.<br />If you like this book, look for Bernard Lewis' &quot;The Political Language of Islam,&quot; which helps us understand the background of various specific Arabic terms that we hear every day on the news.  Also, anything written by Edward Said will serve you in good stead.  In closing, whoever reads this, remember that the Hebrew term &quot;shalom&quot; and the Arabic &quot;Islam&quot; were originally the same, perfectly well-meaning word!  Anyway, this book is great.  Two thumbs up.	2001-10-03
US	52797729	R22QCYLAAB9BB0	0345440919	685854664	Pavane (Del Rey Impact)	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Not Wholly Unspectacular	&quot;Pavane&quot; is a collection of six intertwined, character-driven  short stories, followed by a &quot;coda&quot; which fundamentally challenges any sense you may have been able to make of what you've read up to that point.  Set in an alternate reality in which England was defeated by Spain in 1588, Science has been ruthlessly suppressed by an all-powerful Catholic Church.  The odd thing about this book is that you can't help wondering, upon looking blearily up from the last page, whether perhaps the church actually was acting in mankind's best interest by engineering this suppression...  The characters here are very three-dimensional, and very compelling.  You will find yourself, well, strangely absorbed by the ebb and flow of the fortunes of the Firm of Strange, which tale loosely forms the backstory and background of these curiously interwoven stories.<br />Wow... what a book.  &quot;Pavane&quot; is not your usual &quot;alternate history&quot; book.  To say too much about why this is the case would be a spoiler, but just be prepared for some odd twists near the end.  I enjoyed the story called &quot;The Lady Margaret,&quot; which poetically limns a savagely twisted love triangle, quite a bit.  &quot;Brother John,&quot; about an artist-monk whose life is wildly changed by what he sees at the Inquisition, is incredibly powerful, although as a story I think it has a few flaws.  The latter part of the book is mostly concerned with the machinations and amoral politickings of a group of lords and ladies, which as an American I suppose I found mostly to be just depressing.  Anyway, here you will find powerful elements of fantasy, incredible imagery, and a haunting, grim writing style.  The author once made his living illustrating graphic novels, and this shows through in a myriad of ways.  One has an overpowering sense that the writer could SEE everything that happens in these stories before he wrote them, and just sat down one day to describe what he saw.  In short -- great visuals.  Also, there is more tense, desperate grimness packed into each page than most people who are not citizens of Bangladesh are faced with in an entire lifetime.  Not that that's necessarily a compliment -- I just want prospective readers to be prepared.  I also want to say, for anyone who is new to this genre, to try searching the internet for sites that have the word &quot;Uchronia&quot; somewhere in their text -- you may be pleasantly surprised.<br />I must say it again -- this book is really a far cry from your usual alternate history novel.  The genre, at its best, is typically characterized by an almost painfully cerebral gaming out of the possible concatenated changes which may have accrued if a particular pivotal moment in history had gone... differently.  &quot;Pavane,&quot; however, scarcely ever reminds the reader of the painstakingly scrupulous attention to historical detail which went into the making of &quot;Fatherland&quot; or &quot;Guns of the South.&quot;  This book gets by almost purely, (and quite successfully, I must say) on ATMOSPHERE -- brooding, dark, and grim.  If that's your cup of tea, then by all means please read &quot;Pavane.&quot;	2001-10-02
US	52797729	R1DNA4DC73J5EW	3447025808	937507610	Short Guide to Modern Star Names and Their Derivations	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Well done!	I really enjoyed this book.  The author(s) have done a great deal of homework compiling their facts and theories.  If anyone with a love of this topic happens to have reading ability in German, you should try to track down Mr. Kunitzsch's earlier books on this topic, which this book is distilled from.<br />The foreword is really fascinating, and worth dawdling over.  There is a helpful little chart detailing the way star names have come down to us from so many ancient civilizations -- Babylonia, India, Greece, Rome, Arabia...  The names we use today for most stars seem to have originated, by and large, in Greece or Arabia.  Both these groups of names were filtered through the Islamic world during the Dark Ages, when learning and scholarship were almost totally lost causes in most of Europe, and the Muslims, Jews, and Irish kept the old traditions alive.<br />In light of recent events, I'd just like to point out that basically EVERY major constellation contains at least a few stars that were originally named by Arab shephards.  Somehow it seems like that little fact should have at least a slightly calming effect on people who have taken up hating all Muslims as a hobby, since the events of Sept. 11.  Anyway, it's probably better not to get too political.  This is a very interesting, scholarly, readable little book.  To compare it to Allen's &quot;Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning,&quot; I'd have to point out that Kunitzsch's book focuses exclusively on the history of the names we use in the West today, which makes it a lot more focused and to-the-point.  Allen's book has many intriguing digressions into the folklore of bygone days, but this book rarely succumbs to the temptation to digress.  Just terrific stuff.  Two thumbs up.	2001-09-22
US	52797729	R3HPK5LFRAQQ3	0441002919	550074152	Branch Point	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Provocative and Scary	In \\"Branch Point,\\" two young heroines and a hero live in the year 2062, in a parallel universe. In their universe, President John F. Kennedy severely miscalculated during the Cuban Missile Crisis. There was a catastrophic nuclear war in this universe, and pretty much all surface life was killed off, except for some lichens. The only human survivors are left inside an underground complex, which is simply called The Bunker.  Fortunately, this bunker contains some real scientific geniuses, and they are eventually able to create a time machine. They use this time machine to send the three young people back to 1962, where they talk some sense into JFK. This conversation causes a \\"branch point,\\" which makes the home universe of the three young people forever inaccessible to them, but at least creates a universe where there was no nuclear war. This new universe, incidentally, looks exactly like ours -- until the next time they need the time machine. They use the time machine to prevent war several times, and the branch points they exploit involve Bobby Kennedy's assassination in 1968, and in Russia, Boris Yeltsin's election by acclaim in 1991. Then, in 2013, there's another crisis looming...<br />Mona Clee has written a book for us about the most important things. Most of us, when we hear the phrase \\"the most important things,\\" automatically think of some homey image of raising a family in the suburbs, or possibly a religious belief you hold dear, or, if you're incredibly far-seeing, maybe a charitable organization for feeding impoverished children across the world. Mona Clee helps us to see that we're missing the big picture by thinking this way. The most important thing to worry about is nuclear war.  None of the other things we imagine to be important will even exist if there's a nuclear war. In her book, the heros have a time machine to help prevent a nuclear war. Do you have a time machine? (If you do, please e-mail me). If you don't, you need to think about the message Mona Clee is presenting here.  Human nature is not going to change. Therefore, nuclear war is almost certainly inevitable. If it ever happens, then we all need to start thinking about the basics.  Think about growing your own food indoors, think about shelter. And if you have free time, you might want to spend some of it looking at oncology sites on the internet, just to be safe... Just to drive home the reality of what Mona Clee is talking about -- if you can find a copy, look for a video called \\"Threads,\\" which was a BBC made-for-television movie about nuclear war, made in 1985 by Barry Hines. It's so graphic, it makes \\"The Day After\\" look like \\"The Sound of Music\\" by comparison.<br />Mona Clee's book is both terrifying and entertaining.  Sometimes the characters can be a little flighty, and unattractively immature, but I don't think that's very significant.  Her main goal is clearly to get her readers thinking about nuclear war.  Well, as you can see from this review, her book worked on me. Two thumbs up.	2001-09-15

Gerard O'Neill is an incredible visionary. He and his grad students spent years in workshops and conferences, meticulously working through every imaginable aspect of this herculean, yet possible, endeavor. I first read this tremendous book when it first came out, in 1977. I was in about fifth grade, so a lot of it went over my head.  Still, the basic fact that this is SCIENCE, not science fiction, did sink into brain, and it had a big impact on me.  The ideas in this book were some of the most exciting and important concepts I've ever encountered, period. Finding this book again in the library, a couple years ago, was one of the forces that pushed me back into making a serious commitment to astronomy -- I wish I had pursued astronomy from the time I was a child.<br />As for the book itself -- watch for O'Neill's ideas about the mass driver. That's one of the cooler engineering ideas he presents. The section at the end of this edition, giving input from many of todays astronomical luminaries, is really inspiring stuff too. Some of the sections about the energy crisis, and overpopulation, may feel a little dated to readers today, but his points are still quite valid. He obviously was not quite accurate in the time frame he envisioned, but hey, O'Neill's a visionary -- at least he HAD a vision. It's up to the rest of us to help him flesh it out.<br />Just to throw in my two cents worth -- anyone out there who reads this and would like to make a personal effort to get involved in this grand scheme, why not try building a small scale version of the life support systems he talks about? Specifically, why not try to create some of the radiation-shielded, small scale farms he talks about? If you wanted to kill two birds with one stone, you could even try to design and build a small scale, radiation-shielded, hydroponic farm built for a bomb shelter. The fundamental idea is exactly the same -- trying to design a viable, self-renewing food source that could work for a long period of time indoors, safe from a radiation-saturated environment. Just a thought. There were tons of conferences and workshops devoted to these topics back in the 70s, if you went to any large university's science library they could help you find all kinds of papers to help you get started. With appropriate selection of crops, and of growing media and nutrients, it is possible to grow enough food to support a family of four in a surface area equal to about three ping pong tables. Anyone could do this with today's technology. Just a thought.<br />Anyway, this book is incredibly inspiring, and unbelievably well worked out, to the tiniest details. Absolutely worth owning.	2001-09-09
US	52797729	R1PIKCCRF57Q86	0804722218	746606708	Old English and Its Closest Relatives: A Survey of the Earliest Germanic Languages	Books	5	149	155	N	N	Exciting and eye-opening	This fantastic little tome makes me completely reevaluate my ideas about how languages should be taught.  Employing only the most minimal amount of linguistics terminology, Robinson walks the reader through seven texts in related Germanic languages.  At the period they were written, these were not even distinct languages, but merely dialects of what experts in diachronic linguistics call &quot;Proto-Germanic.&quot;  The reader begins to see the connections between languages almost immediately.  This is what I mean by saying that this is how languages should be taught.  Bringing in a substantial etymological component to language teaching somehow provides context for each word, which somehow makes it more interesting and gripping.  <br />For example -- here is a phrase in Old Frisian, which is a Germanic language that only grad students have ever heard of.  The phrase is this, &quot;&quot;Thu skalt erja thinne feder and thine moder, thet tu theste langor libbe.&quot;  Look familiar?  If your life has ever brought you into contact with the Ten Commandments, it might remind you of the phrase &quot;Thou shalt honor thy father and thy mother, that you might longer live.&quot;  That's good if you make that connection, because that's what it means.  That isn't even in English!  Isn't that cool?!?!  The whole book is full of things like that.<br />In terms of layout, Robinson begins with two introductory chapters in which he walks us through some of the more salient ideas in historical linguistics.  The second chapter is very important to understand the bulk of the book.  Please dwell on it, and try to read it through at least twice before moving on.  Seriously, do this, it will only help.  Then there are seven chapters on seven &quot;dialects&quot; of Proto-Germanic, followed up by an interesting little chapter on some controversial issues over which scholars wrangle.  Each chapter has several recommendations for further reading at the end of the chapter.  I myself have only tried out the recommendation for two of the chapters, Old Frisian an Old Norse, but Robinson's recommendations were terrific for me.<br />One thing I need to mention -- there is a chart of correspondences in sounds and grammar, on pages 250-251.  Somehow, this chart was left out of the table of contents.  It is very helpful -- you might want to dog-ear page 250, so you can always find it easily for quick reference, as you're going through each chapter.<br />Anyway, this book is great for the undergrad linguist, or for any armchair time traveller.  Two thumbs up!	2001-09-09
US	52797729	R2ARSDXDYS4BAU	0917352114	426378414	The Day After Midnight: The Effects of Nuclear War	Books	4	4	9	N	N	Some non-minor additional points	I posted the only other review of this useful book.  I would just like to make a couple of emendations.  The author of this book compiles useful graphics and charts to explain why every 18 inches of topsoil will reduce radiation in a shelter by a factor of ten.  This is helpful, as far as it goes.  <br />I would just like to point out something that he doesn't go into in much depth, namely the fact that a shock wave from a nuclear blast could very easily blow away a lot of that topsoil, even if you were a few miles from the blast center.  Also, he should go into more detail about the fact that the guidance systems of Russian, Iraqi, etc. missiles are not very well tested, thank God.  The problem with this is that there is considerable uncertainty about where they might actually strike.  We just can't be sure -- they could be &quot;off&quot; their intended targets by a matter of miles.  Therefore, if, like me, you are absolutely terrified of the very high chance that this kind of war could  happen in the not-necessarily-very-distant future, you should try hard to procure shelter AS FAR AS POSSIBLE from cities, oil refineries or military targets.  Ever consider buying yourself some real estate in Saskatchewan?  How about Manitoba?  You might want to give the idea some careful thought.  And once you've bought it, try building your shelter a lot more than three feet underground.  Personally, I hope to build mine at least ten or fifteen feet down, when I can afford it.  Finally, don't forget about HYDROPONICS.  There are a lot of ways you can grow food in a shelter, if the outside environment should become lethal for crops.  Please do as much research as you can about hydroponics online -- unless, of course, you don't consider having a reliable food supply after civilization falls apart to be a high priority.  Good luck.	2001-07-13
US	52797729	R5ZG10DPY3IG0	0440401585	45209294	A Swiftly Tilting Planet	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Fantastic in at least two senses -- a great book	Fans of Madeleine L'Engle's Murry family are treated here to another of their adventures.  Charles Wallace is fifteen years old now, and it is his fate to travel back in time and enter the souls of various folk from the olden days.  By doing this, and by trying to exert positive mental energy upon these people, (while also trying to survive, and not to flip his proverbial lid,) he hopes to prevent a nuclear apocalypse, which his itinerant genius father knows is on the verge of happening.  What I mean by this is that, by being a force for positive change in the past, Charles Wallace hopes to head off happenings in the past which are causally linked to the impending catastrophe of the near future.  Charles Wallace has divine assistance, in the form of another member of Madeleine L'Engle's mental stable of heavenly creatures -- I'll let readers discover this creature for themselves.<br />The only reason I give this story four stars is that it is pretty slow going.  The plot is highly complicated, and there are a few loops thrown in there that seem to just confuse the action.  That said, it's still very interesting, and worth wading through.  You might want to stop every few chapters to go over what has happened so far, and make sure you aren't lost.<br />I'd like to point out, also, that the legend Madeleine L'Engle draws upon for much of her tale, the story of the Welsh prince Madoc sailing to America long before Columbus, in 1170 A.D., is a real legend.  Madeleine L'Engle did NOT make up that story -- real people really used to believe it was true.  Some people still believe it today.  In fact, one of the reasons that Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark out west, was to look for descendants of the legendary Prince Madoc.  Anyone who finds this legend exciting should know about the book &quot;Madoc and the Discovery of America,&quot; by Richard Deacon.  It's out of print, but ask your local librarian to help you find a copy.  There's another book, called &quot;The Children of First Man,&quot; by James Alexander Thom, that deals with the same legend, in a speculative and interesting way.  Look at my Amazon.com review of that book, if you want suggestions for further reading.  Also, a series of books just came out this January, by Pat Winter, called &quot;Madoc.&quot;  These are really excellent examples of historical fiction, if you enjoy this kind of thing...  Finally, I'd like to very briefly encourage anyone who is scared by Madeleine L'Engle's use of the idea of nuclear war, as a plot device, to do some research online about this very frightening topic.  There's a lot of information on the internet to help understand the threat of nuclear war -- and the more you read about it, the better you'll understand it.<br />Anyway -- this book is terrific.  Two thumbs up.	2001-06-19
US	52797729	R2YYHBKOEEMBS1	0441218911	472898047	Expanded Universe	Books	5	20	21	N	N	Hard-nosed, yet compassionate	When all is said and done, you can't help respecting Robert Heinlein.  The man knew what he wanted to say, and by jiminy he went out there and said it...  This book, along with &quot;Grumbles from the Grave,&quot; probably cleaves closer to the heart of Heinlein's spirit than any three of his other books combined.  It is a collection of short pieces: some nonfiction articles; others, slightly fictionalized accounts of very real political concerns.  My favorite piece is &quot;Solution Unsatisfactory,&quot; which was one of the earliest pieces in science fiction to deal so intelligently with the threat of nuclear war. Heinlein also includes a few accounts of trips that he and his wife made to the Soviet Union.  They really tried hard to be open-eyed, open-minded observers of everything they saw.  Things have changed in Russia since they were there, but it's worth reading just to sate one's appetite for Heinlein's distinctive voice.  (For anyone interested in more up-to-date accounts of Russia, read anything by David Shipler.)  Heinlein's time at Annapolis shows through in many of these pieces, as it does in virtually everything else he wrote.  He seemed to have a very, very clear sense of America as a &quot;country,&quot; or even as a &quot;nation,&quot; as opposed to a &quot;society.&quot;  What I mean by this is that many of these pieces reflect a powerful understanding of the fundamental reality that America is a MILITARY entity, apart from being an economic juggernaut and a staunch promoter, on the international scene, of youth culture and our entertainment-based value system.  Heinlein's military and political understanding is a disturbing one, but it is more securely grounded in serious, military realities than that of most authors writing today.<br />The pre-eminent concern in &quot;Expanded Universe&quot; is the threat of nuclear war.  Heinlein, as anyone familiar with his writings will know, wrote firmly out of the Cold War tradition.  &quot;Solution Unsatisfactory&quot; is the best example of this kind of thinking in this volume.  Personally, I'd like to interject, I see absolutely no correlation whatsoever between the end of the Cold War and any putative decrease in the threat to mankind posed by nuclear weapons.  I, for one, couldn't care less whether the dude aiming MIRV missiles at my kitchen speaks Russian, Arabic, Chinese, or, heck, even Navajo -- the point is that armed conflict will always exist, and now that nuclear weapons exist too, the clock is frankly ticking away the last seconds/hours/days/years/decades (decades?  Let's hope so...) on mankind's time remaining on Earth.  <br />For anyone who is genuinely disturbed by Heinlein's ideas, I want to make a few recommendations.  Try to find a copy of &quot;Nuclear Shelterist,&quot; by Walton McCarthy.  It's out of print right now, but it's obviously worth trying to track down.  Ask your friendly local librarian for help in finding it.  Also -- if you can locate a copy of the British movie &quot;Threads,&quot; you should see it.  It's extremely frightening and graphic -- do NOT watch it with your kids in the house.  I'm very serious about that.  That said, it is an absolutely uncompromising overview of the currently accepted, likely aftermath of a nuclear war, extrapolated over a period of thirteen years after the war happens.  It's horrifying enough that it might prompt you to get involved in some way.  You might have to search a little to find the video -- not all video stores carry it.  However, fifteen minutes of calling all the video stores in the yellow pages will probably be enough to track it down.  Finally, I'd like to recommend &quot;Hydroponic Home Food Gardens,&quot; by Howard Resh.  If we ever have a nuclear war, indoor  hydroponic gardens will be just about the only way of growing food successfully, and people who have them will have a VASTLY higher chance of surviving the worldwide economic chaos and food shortages which will definitely follow such a war.  Whether you would actually be glad you survived is, of course, another question.<br />Well, I just wanted to make a little contribution, online, to the kind of concerns that Heinlein wrote about in &quot;Expanded Universe.&quot;  I like to think that he would have approved of my passing on those tips...  Anyway, this book is fantastic.  Buy it, please, and get copies for your friends.  People need to be more aware of this stuff.  I give this book seven hundred billion thumbs up.	2001-06-02

I posted a review here for this book on April 6, which was essentially highly laudatory.  I just want to make a couple of very brief additional comments...  I recommended track and field as a sport, if young people who have this believe themselves to be in circumstances that leave them no alternative but to participate in sports.  I'd just like to point out that there's something about the constant driving yourself, the constant lunging forward in particular, that in certain respects can constitute a profound violation of the basically still, trancelike state that the authors of this book describe so perceptively.  I just want to add that brief caveat -- track is still a good sport for people with Aspergers, because you need zero coordination, but make sure you don't let the constant pushing yourself forward totally abnegate your ability to trance out...  Personally, I experienced this conflict as a war between my ability to relax into the BACK of my mind, and the necessity of taking all that energy and putting it physically in the FRONT of my mind, or face, and sort of clench it there.. something like that.  It's hard to explain, this is just a vague feeling I'm talking about here, but I thought it could be worth sharing.  Just be careful, and if possible, let yourself take the energy that the demands of Youth drive you to put into physical activity, and instead, put that energy into scientific pursuits, like you know you want to do anyway.  That's the way to make the world a better place.... just my two cents worth.  Once again, this book is a truly stellar achievement.  Pick up a copy, and share it with your boss, friends, family, etc.	2001-06-01
US	52797729	R19M5I0LNY10OH	0942299906	492190707	Wonders and the Order of Nature, 1150-1750	Books	5	48	51	N	N	Unusual and Engrossing	The authors of this study do a magnificent job of looking at a cross-section of the history of Wonder itself, sort of &quot;in the large,&quot; as well as the history of wondrous objects, from the slice of time upon which they focus.  This book was twenty years in the making, off and on, and it really shows.  Every point they make clearly has been carefully weighed, backed up, and illustrated, as often as not, with beautiful selections from poetry, etc.  The authors state in the preface that they began with the study of monsters, which in the final, published version of their book is relegated to chapter five.  Know, O Reader, that the material in that chapter constituted the starting impetus for this whole study, and you will have a better understanding of various structural oddities in the book.<br />One of the main themes the authors deal with is not exactly an historical overview of science, but more along the lines of social and cultural history.  They write about the relationship of elites, be they religious, social, or academic, to various kinds of wonder.  Do the elites embrace wonder?  Do they despise it?  And what about lone philosophers?  Where do they fit in?  The answers vary greatly, according to multitudinous factors.  For me, one theme to bear in mind while reading this book was my own experience of wonder, or curiosity, and the clashing of that feeling with &quot;The Game&quot; in school...  Anyone reading this book will, obviously, have an extremely active, inquisitive mind, to say the least.  Think back (or think forward, as the case may be,) to your time in school.  Did you tend to keep the topics that provoked genuine wonder in you private?  Did you generally avoid mentioning them, lest they should happen to become candidates for impacting &quot;The Game,&quot; over which the more sociable people in any classroom preside?  These are two very different states of mind, and their interplay can be quite fearfully tumultuous.  If you know what I'm talking about, then you already have a feel for the kind of issues that the authors of this book delve into, and deal with on an incredibly grand scale.<br />By the way, I'd like to recommend a couple of other titles for people looking at this book.  For some reason, neither of these are in this book's bibliography.  I'm not sure why not -- probably because they are so basic that the authors may have felt that anyone reading their book would already know about them.  For people who might NOT know about them, I'd like to recommend &quot;The Great Chain of Being,&quot; by Arthur O. Lovejoy, and Rudolph Pfeiffer's two volume study of &quot;The History of Classical Scholarship.&quot;  These volumes will add whole dimensions to your understanding of the matters that Daston and Park discuss, if anybody out there is interested.<br />This book is a prodigious feat.  Worth scoping out.	2001-05-24

I found this book while doing a search online about Samarkand, for an historical fiction novel I'm working on.  This book tempts me to drop everything else I'm doing in my life, and just study China all the time. <br />Let me just quickly point out that there are only three or four illustrations in this book, and that they are in black and white.  The constant references in other reviews of this book to its &quot;gorgeousness,&quot; and beauty, apply to the style in which it is written.  It really is a pleasure to read this work.  Every page brims over with measured, cadenced sentences that just flow, like terraced waterfalls of prepositional phrases.  It all sounds so natural that one suspects that Mr. Schafer actually spoke like this.  It simply doesn't have the feel of extensively edited prose...  In reading this book, oddly enough, it is best to start with the introduction, and the first chapter, pausing to dwell carefully upon the last two sections of the first chapter, entitled &quot;Exotic Taste&quot; and &quot;Exotic Literature.&quot;  Then, I recommend taking some time to just browse back and forth, to see what catches your eye.  The book isn't really set up to be read straight through cover to cover -- it's more of a wandering browser's feast.  Also, it's not a bad idea to return periodically to the table of contents, just to reinstate and solidify your own sense of the context, and the taxonomy of all these funky knick-knacks.  Finally, there are kind of a lot of footnotes, but it's usually worth being patient and flipping back and forth to the back of the book.  Most of then are pretty interesting. <br />Some of my personal favorite bizarre, hilarious sections in this book are as follows...  &quot;Lamp Trees,&quot; &quot;Water Sheep and Ice Silkworms,&quot; &quot;Feather Garments,&quot; &quot;Dragon's Blood,&quot; &quot;Python Bile,&quot;   &quot;Fish Tusks,&quot; (?!?!) and &quot;Fire Orbs.&quot;  These sections areextremely well presented, placed with related items in eighteen carefully thought out categories, such as Aromatics, Textiles, Industrial Minerals, Sacred Objects, Wild Animals, and so on.  Each topic is presented interestingly, with discussions of it's significance, and often with reference to folktales, historical tidbits, or other means of placing the exotica in even cooler contexts. <br />If you get this book, and enjoy it, I'd like to recommend &quot;Passing Strange and Wonderful,&quot; by Yi-Fu Tuan, which is a sort of global historical survey of aesthetic awareness.  Chapter nine, especially, deals with the T'ang dynasty, and therefore probably has enhanced relevance for anyone who actually is reading this review.  If you enjoy surveys of the unusual, especially in (roughly) this time period, then I'd like to seize this opportunity to recommend &quot;Wonders and the Order of Nature, 1150-1750&quot; written by two eminent historians of science, Lorraine Daston and Katherine Park.  It focuses upon Western societies, but has many interesting thematic parallels to this very enjoyable work. <br />I wish I were some kind of mutant, so I could give this book three or more thumbs up.	2001-05-19

In fifteen chapters and an epilogue, we are treated here to articulate, carefully crafted commentary and overviews of a myriad of medieval Islamic scientific, pseudo-scientific, and philosophical milieus.  Turner presents us with chapters upon astronomy, medicine, geography, alchemy, and  mathematics, among many other topics, as well as the Greek, Egyptian, Roman, Babylonian, etc. roots of the traditions surveyed.  Each chapter includes intelligently selected material, which is oftentimes broken down into various subsections, for increased clarity and focus.  One thing that the new reader of this book might want to be aware of is that the body of text in  most chapters is  literally only five to ten pages long. A lot of information is conveyed in the sections at the end of each chapter, which consist of beautiful (black and white) photographs and illustrations of various medieval islamic scientific instruments, observatories, learning academies, etc.  Below the photographs are pithy, well-written commentaries upon the objects in the photographs.  Don't skip over these commentaries -- they contain some of the best material in the book.  Also watch for the helpful timeline in an appendix at the end, the glossary of unfamiliar Arabic vocabulary, and the very useful bibliography.  Definitely take the time to scan through the bibliography, if you have any interest in pursuing further work in this area.  It contains most of the classic works on this topic, and many lesser-known articles, books, etc.<br />Many people reading this may be interested in the historical background of Islam, or in the medieval period in and of itself.  For people who come to this book from curiosity about how our  classical heritage was preserved during the centuries between Rome and the Renaissance, (i.e., while the Islamic world was keeping the scholarly and scientific traditions alive, and Europe generally went to pieces), I'd like to take this opportunity to recommend &quot;Scribes and Scholars: A Guide to the Transmission of Latin and Greek Literature,&quot; by L.D. Reynolds.  The title tells you what that book is about, and it's very well done.<br />This book is very interesting, very well-researched, and beautifully presented.  Two enthusiastic thumbs up.	2001-05-17

Eventually he learns that his personality and memories have been distilled into a sort of RNA serum, which can be injected into whomever the omnipotent State of the future decides to inject them into. Corbell's new body is the body of a criminal, whose crime was so awful the State gave him the penalty of having his personality wiped, and replaced with Corbell's. The new Corbell finds he is not destined to fit into this new society, but instead has been chosen to pilot a Bussard Ramjet (one of Niven's favorite devices) to scout for new planets for humanity to go to. Rebelliously, Corbell steals the starship, and pilots it to the galactic core, just to go sightseeing. In the meantime, his hated personal teacher from his days in the care of the ... (oops, I meant the State) has reprogrammed the shipboard computer by radio to take on his own irritating personality. This is the only \\"person\\" poor Corbell can talk to... Eventually, they make it back to Earth, or somewhere that looks like Earth, although it is now orbitting Jupiter. There follows a quest for immortality through the ruined city-states of futuristic Antarctica, which has long since become tropical, while Corbell is stalked by the psycho-babe Mirelly-Lyra Zeelashisthar. All the while, he must deal with the bizarre sociology of societies of immortal Girls and Boys, who are simply children who were the beneficiaries of immortality drugs which would only work on people who had not yet reached puberty.<br />Basically, this is a pretty freaky story.<br />Like a couple of other reviewers here, I first read \\"A World Out of Time\\" years ago, in about 5th grade or so. Every time I've re-read it, I get more out of it. Larry Niven is incapable of dawdling about with little ideas, or physically limited engineering projects. Everything he writes about, particularly in this book, is on a macro-macro-macro scale. It's all quite inordinately neato. And ladies, be ready to cheer for Mirelly-Lyra Zeelashisthar -- talk about a powerful, fearsome female character. WOW. <br />There is a very subtle, very faint suggestion that the whole book may possibly be a dream, or that some other odd thing is going on.  Corbell's wife in his normal life has a name very similar to Mirelly-Lyra's name, and Mirelly-Lyra's long-dead lover's name was quite similar to Corbell's.  Something seemed odd about this, to me.<br />This book will keep your brain popping with new ideas for months, maybe even years. Definitely two thumbs up.	2001-05-16
US	52797729	R3B857NC7SE7T	0553278223	726968599	The Martian Chronicles (The Grand Master Editions)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Hauntingly Entrancing	The stories compiled in this collection chronicle the imaginary history of a series of rocket flights to Mars.  Encounters with the Martians range in nature from the mystical to the fearful, and sometimes include a tincture of both elements.  As a few other reviewers have pointed out, there are constant echoes of the story of white, European settlers of America and their encounters with the Native Americans.  You should try to remember that, and watch for examples of it, while reading these stories.  Be aware that college students in many other countries are given these stories to read by professors, in classes on American literature, as examples of the way American writers turn the Native American experience into fiction.<br />Most of these stories, as I said, are drawn from the Native American experience.  Here, I will mention a couple of exceptions, which are also great reading.  &quot;The Million Year Picnic&quot; is one of my favorite stories, not only because it has such a neat title, but because it has a number of incredibly beautiful images, and prompts the reader to really think hard about man's chances for survival.  Another one of my favorites is...  I cannot recall the title, but it concerns a lost, telepathic Martian who stumbles into a town of humans.  He instantly, physically transforms into a look-alike facsimile of whomever the people he is near are thinking of -- a lost child, a dead son, etc.  You really feel for him as he morphs through various identities.  He is like a puppet on a million strings, with ten thousand warring puppeteers pulling him hither and yon, until his very mind undergoes a horrifyingly apocalyptic meltdown.  Cool to read about, but it doesn't sound like a very fun thing to actually experience, to put it mildly.<br />This slim book is one of the most beloved additions to... not only to the genre of science fiction, but to American literature as a whole.  Ray Bradbury personally, in interviews, constantly questions whether he should be considered a &quot;science fiction writer.&quot;  If you stop and think about it, this book will make you see what he means.  He includes rockets, Mars, etc. in these stories, but they often feel more like Edgar Allen Poe or Wallace Stegner than Isaac Asimov or Arthur C. Clarke.  The latter two writers I just mentioned, along with many others, have often called Bradbury a &quot;prose poet&quot; -- without rhyming his words, he makes you feel like you are reading poetry.  This, I hasten to mention, is a pretty darned cool trick, if you can do it.<br />I can't say enough good things about this book.  Very worth it.  Please scope it out.	2001-04-21

US	52797729	R26FVS57U1K110	156838257X	242490415	Exercise Addiction: When Fitness Becomes an Obsession (The Teen Health Library of Eating Disorder Prevention)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Fills a real void	This is an intelligent, careful approach to a topic that is difficult to even imagine as being BAD, in the context of our society of cheeseburger-inhaling lardos. Exercise addiction is a very real thing, however, and this book could easily get someone thinking along more reasonable lines. This book is aimed at a relatively younger target audience, teenagers and people in their early twenties. I think later in life, some different issues can come into play in this kind of addiction, but this book does a pretty solid job of talking to younger people where they're at.<br />I would just like to say here -- for anyone purchasing this book, whether it's for yourself, or for someone else, the most important thing you need to be aware of is the RATIONALIZATIONS that lead to people behaving in this way. Yes, it's important to be cognizant of your actual behaviors, but the rationalizations that lead you to consider what is obviously unbalanced behavior to be perfectly okay constitute a deeper issue. Most likely, your rationalizations come from a disturbing, potent combination of 1.)the work ethic and 2.)youth-glorification. Try to stop and think about what your rationalizations are. You probably often think in terms of &quot;self-improvement.&quot; You probably do a lot of goal-setting, like running X amount of miles per week, or something along thiose lines. Probably you're saying things to yourself that place any possibility of your personal happiness far out in the future, after, for example, you have run a marathon. All of these things can be laudable traits, laudable goals, but you need to be able to step outside yourself and get a little perspective. Also -- don't keep constantly thinking about happiness as an inherently &quot;future&quot; state. There is SOME happiness to be gleaned from, for example, completing a marathon, but just don't sacrifice too much of what life has to offer along the way. You need to stop and enjoy being young. You'll only be young once, unless those Buddhists are right...  Either way, you need to relax your mind, and leave your body alone. Stop beating yourself up. If you have a overly strong association in your mind between physical fitness and being attrative to the opposite sex... well, okay, there is obviously some correlation between the two, especially at your age. However -- this correlation diminishes a LOT with every passing year after about age 23. If you make an investment in your mind now, instead of your body, it will pay off well in your future.<br />In some ways, what someone might call &quot;exercise addiction&quot; might come from very real forces in your life that simply will not go away for awhile.  There are real beliefs, real... well... real realities, that won't change.  Some households may put an unusually high premium upon physical fitness, for example.  Still, try to keep a sense of perspective.  At least TRY to find calmer ways of being happy in the moment, while you're young, and don't be so frenzied.<br />This book is a great idea. Two thumbs up.	2001-03-29
US	52797729	R2EYYR5FLE4V2	0671319728	290654926	1632 (Ring Of Fire)	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Howard Zinn's politics with John Philip Sousa's patriotism	In this novel, a town in West Virginia suddenly gets picked up by a cosmic &quot;Ring of Fire,&quot; and is suddenly transported back in time to the middle of the Thirty Years' War in Germany, in the Seventeenth Century.  The scientific aspects of this event are mostly glossed over in a brief prologue -- it's supposed to be the doing of a band of irresponsible aliens.  That hardly figures into the story at all, however.  The main point of reading this book is to get your face rubbed in a certain robust brand of populist political philosophy, with a lot of military action thrown in for good measure.  If you like Robert Heinlein's more militaristic writings, you will love &quot;1632.&quot;<br />The little town of West Virginians must survive in an incredibly hostile environment, as refugees flood into their territory.  Outside, one of the bloodiest wars of the past millenium rages, as the forces of feudalism clash with the emerging forces of freedom of religion, and nationalism.  Eric Flint has astutely recognized that the time was ripe in the 1630s for many concepts fundamental to American democracy, and out of these concepts he has fashioned a terrific tale.  The Americans adrift in a strange land must not only survive, but try to ensure that the world they have landed in might become a better place for their having been there...  The militaristic component of this story can get to be a bit much at times.  There are a LOT of rousing cheers, and high-spirited charges...  Probably my favorite character is the daughter of a Sephardic Jewish family, whose incredibly cultivated mind comes to be a major asset to the little town of lost Americans.<br />A few reviewers here have noted that Flint's writing style isn't overly sophisticated.  Lighten up.  Many people in this country haven't been preposterously overeducated enough to have opinions about things like that, and many of the characters in his story are of that very background.  If you want your ideas to meet with awide audience, maybe it isn't so wrong to keep your writing style simple enough that regular folks can understand what you're saying.<br />If you enjoy this kind of story, let me quickly recommend &quot;An Island in the Sea of Time,&quot; by...  I cannot recall the author's name, but if you can find the book, you should remember his name, because he's really good.   Michael Crichton's &quot;Timeline&quot; is another great read, in a very similar way, as is L. Sprague de Camp's &quot;Lest Darkness Fall.&quot;  If you are excited by the kind of IDEAS in Eric Flint's book, as opposed to the story per se, you should think about reading &quot;A People's History of the United States,&quot; by Howard Zinn, or &quot;The Federalist Papers,&quot; edited by James Madison.	2001-03-29

Books	4	7	7	N	N	Pretty Freaky	This is a pretty entertaining compilation of urban folklore.  Please take note, however, anyone who might be expecting a scholarly tome -- THIS IS PRESENTED IN THE FORMAT OF A COMIC BOOK.  Be aware of that.  Still, it's a lot of fun.  Every supposedly true story you've ever been told, that &quot;honestly&quot; happened to your brother-in-law's mechanic's bartender's plumber's girlfriend's babysitter's cousin's baseball coach's otolaryngologist's lawyer just last week...  It's all in here.  If you happened to catch the movie &quot;Urban Legend,&quot; a lot of the story elements can be found in this book.  I'd like to throw in one small note -- the urban legend called &quot;Resurrection Mary&quot; is one of the spookier ones, and I assumed it was an urban legend like all the rest of them, but that one actually is based on a true story.  The History Channel has been running a series called &quot;History's Mysteries,&quot; and they covered the true story it came from.  Apart from that exception, I'm pretty sure all of these are authentic urban legends.<br />Anyway, this book is a lot of fun.  Worth checking out.	2001-03-26

Some people who have reviewed this book seem to have a problem with the way so many of the stories have appeared elsewhere.  I suppose that if you are a really hardcore conoisseur of alternate history, that might grate on you a little, but I'm new enough to the genre that the issue didn't come up on my radar.<br />A.A.Attanasio's story is terrific.  It is written in the style of Chinese literature, and deals with a man in an America that was originally settled by the Chinese (the United Sandalwood Autocracies -- U.S.A.)  A.A., if you read this, please click on my &quot;about me&quot; link right up above and e-mail me.  I'm working on a novel that deals with the same premise you use, among other premises.  I'd prefer not to be sued to death.<br />L.Sprague de Camp was an early pace-setter in this genre, with &quot;Lest Darkness Fall,&quot; and here he proves himself again with &quot;Aristotle and the Gun.&quot;  <br />&quot;The Forest of Time&quot; by Michael C. Flynn is probably my favorite.  Set in a world where the United States never quite came together, it follows the adventures of a cross-world traveller from our world who tells about several other alternate historical timelines, and then gets caught up with his captors in a phildickian (love that word) morass of speculations about the nature of madness, of time, etc.<br />All the stories are interesting, and worth reading.  Other reviewers have discussed them in the following pages, however, so let me just say that there is a very good introductory essay by Shelly Shapiro, which I recommend reading carefully.  Also -- one story which I wish were in here is &quot;The Sleeping Serpent&quot; by Pamela Sargent, a very cool story set in an America settles by Genghis Khan's hordes, which you can find in &quot;The Way it Wasn't,&quot; compiled by Martin Greenberg.<br />To sum up -- I enjoyed this book a lot.  Definitely two thumbs up.	2001-03-25

It is symetrical, it spins around a central axis, it is...  not natural.  SOMEONE built it.  Mankind's first contact with life from beyond our world has begun.<br />Arthur C. Clarke has done a great job, in this book, of combining his speculations about future sociology, future religions, and future genetic engineering, with the wonder of First Contact.  And beyond that -- practically every page bristles with hardcore science.  Look as hard as you want, you will not find a more expertly crafted dramatization of the forces of physics in action.  You will find here useful paradigms to help yourself visualize, and understand, forces such as inertia, momentum, gravity, centripetal force...  I have been told that this book is often given as assigned reading in M.I.T. physics classes, to help students get a grip on some of these forces.<br />If you like this book, and want your science fiction with a strong dose of genuine science (not swords and sorcery), let me recommend to you &quot;Mission of Gravity&quot; by Hal Clement.  I think it's out of print right now, but ask your friendly local librarian to help you find a copy.  It will really help you understand all kinds of important scientific ideas, both from physics and chemistry.  The author is a real, respected and beloved science teacher, who used his classroom experience to give shape to his exposition of scientific matters.  Also, for hardcore science in your science fiction, you should be aware of the name Gregory Benford.  Read anything by him, you can't possibly go wrong.<br />To sum up -- I love this book.  If you have any appreciation for good science fiction, don't be a fool, and buy this book right now.	2001-03-23
US	52797729	R3GQFIIIE9YAYP	0064471063	440200388	The Horse and His Boy	Books	4	10	14	N	N	Interesting and Engrossing	Shasta is a boy in Calormen, a realm to the south of Narnia. He is perhaps not quite a slave -- but he's pretty close. His life is basically barely worth living, and he suddenly learns it is about to get far worse, because he is about to be sold into outright slavery. Desperate, he chooses to make a break for it, and is assisted by an amazing encounter with a talking horse, named Bree. Together, they flee toward Narnia and the North, meeting on the way a high-spirited girl named Aravis, with a horse of her own. The plot thickens as they become involved in a race to reach Narnia before an army of Calormenes, who, they learn, are preparing a sneaky, and potentially devastating, invasion of Narnia. Aslan, readers will be relieved to hear, figures prominently in the story.<br />One interesting element of this story is that we have a few chapters to see what Lucy and Edmund are like, as adult Narnian kings and queens. Fans of Narnia will remember from &quot;The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe&quot; that Lucy, Edmund, Peter and Susan went to Narnia as children, but due to the freaky laws of Narnian time, they became adult kings and queens over the course of a single afternoon. The action in this book apparently takes place during that afternoon (in Earth time,) because Shasta and Aravis meet Lucy and Edmund and are able to help them... Another point about this book -- if you have met Eilonwy in Lloyd Alexander's Prydain books, and if you liked her character, then you will enjoy Aravis. They are quite similar.<br />Children reading this review, be aware that C.S. Lewis is NOT considered to be the most tolerant, understanding person of Islam, or Islamic people.  Many of the characters in this book reflect this outlook.  If you are interested in Calormen and its desert-dwelling, turbaned people, I recommend going to an encyclopedia and looking up the word &quot;Islam.&quot; C.S. Lewis drew quite a bit upon this subject in creating Calormen, for better or for worse.  Especially these days, children need to be extra-careful about what attitudes you may be subliminally picking up.  It's a good adventure story, but be very careful when you're booing at the &quot;bad guys.&quot;  Adults reading this review -- if you are curious about the intellectual traditions out of which C.S. Lewis was operating in creating this book, let me recommend &quot;Orientalism&quot; by Edward Said. For a different view of the kind of battles portrayed in the latter chapters in this book, I recommend &quot;The Crusades Through Arab Eyes&quot; by Amin Maalouf.	2001-03-18

The photographer has captured so much color in each photograph, you almost expect some sort of visual explosion -- how can such a dynamically variegated palette be contained in a single picture?!  The whitewashed cottages, the blue-green sea, the dun colored old castle walls... even the street signs are beautiful.  I myself am half of Irish descent, and half of Italian descent.  Although I must confess that in culinary terms, my Italian forebears had considerably more &quot;on the ball&quot; than my Irish ancestors, this book makes me appreciate some of the beauties that Ireland itself has to offer.  It makes me determined to visit it at some point.<br />The book is divided into four parts.  Each traditional ancient Irish kingdom has its own section -- Ulster, Leinster, Connacht, and Munster.  Each section is also followed by a brief photographic essay, dealing with such topics as &quot;Ancient Ireland,&quot; &quot;Bar and Shop Fronts,&quot; and &quot;Painted Villages.&quot;  At the end, there is a useful map, a travellers guide complete with phone numbers and addresses of Inns and hostels, and a very handy little bibliography.<br />I would just like to also recommend, for anyone with an interest in Irish history, &quot;The Atlas of Irish History&quot; by Sean Duffy.  It is out of print, but you should ask your local librarian if he or she can find it, using OCLC or inter-library loan.  If, like me, you have Irish blood in you, you will be familiar with the feeling of being quite alienated from the broader sweep of European history prior to the settlement of America.  I once looked in the index of an encyclopedia, and actually found more entries on Native Americans, who of course are considered to be a marginalized people, than I could find on the Irish.  This book, and the atlas I recommended, can help remedy that situation, and &quot;The Most Beautiful Villages of Ireland&quot; can beautify any home.  Two thunbs up -- checkthis one out.	2001-03-18

This book provided me with my first FACTUAL survey of this science-fiction-ish area of scientific research.  Nanotechnology, as the blurb up above says, is the emerging science of creating self-replicating robots the size of molecules.  These tiny robots, if developed, should be able to have an almost unimaginable impact on human civilization.  For example, they could be swallowed in the form of a tablet, which might release millions of tiny robots into the body with the aim of attacking cancer cells.  They could be set to work transforming, for example, grass clippings into rice by monkeying around with the composition of grass at the atomic level.  People are seriously researching scary stuff like this.  There is a lot of science fiction out there about this kind of thing, especially dealing with the infamous (and not impossible) &quot;gray goo&quot; scenario, in which nanorobots run amok and accidentally rip the whole planet into undifferentiated submolecular slime.  <br />Ed Regis is careful here to present the actual state of the field, and also to give some interesting insights into the curiously cultlike following that has grown up around Eric Drexler.<br />I recommend this book as a dispassionate assessment of what really COULD be one of the biggest technological revolutions since... oh, I don't know...  the wheel comes to mind.  Or fire.  Or the printed word.  My only problem with this book is that it's slightly behind the times nowadays.  Nanotechnology is even less science fiction today, in 2001, than it was when this book came out.  People should understand, while reading this, that IBM, Hewlett Packard, and other corporate behemoths are spending tens of millions of dollars RIGHT NOW to develop nanotechnology.  Some of America's top business schools have Nanotechnology Clubs to monitor potentially lucrative developments in this field -- I'm thinking specifically of Wharton, which I know for a fact has such a club, and I've been told that Stanford and Harvard do as well.<br />I don't think it's possible to be too highly aware of this field of study.  I recommend buying this book, and talking about it with family and friends.  Pass it around, encourage your friends to pick up a copy for themselves.  If you are in school, or have children in school, ask your science teacher to try to do a unit on it.  Heck, why not form a club.  Try anything, it doesn't matter what you do specifically, just try to become informed.  Also -- it is easy to find newsgroups and listservs online about nanotechnology.  Just go to any search engine and type in &quot;nanotechnology&quot; and &quot;listserv,&quot; and you'll find a source of valuable information for yourself.<br />This book is very worth owning.  Two thumbs up.	2001-03-09

It  is compelling, and important to understand.  The author conducts moving interviews with a number of people, and elicits responses that make you want to cry.  If anyone out there wants to get involved in some way, you could do an online search for UNHCR, which is the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.  They have a very user friendly website, I recommend it.  If anyone wants to click on &quot;see more about me&quot; under my name at the beginning of this review, my e-mail address is listed there.  You could e-mail me.  I am connected to a group of citizens trying to help with the development of public libraries in Rwanda, in the hope that literacy and education will have some impact on the situation there.  If you decide to get involved with this, be aware that they need materials having to do with scientific education there.  Rwandans need doctors, engineers, agronomists, etc., and many average Americans have books just lying around in their homes that could totally transform a Rwandan child's life.  I hope to hear from you.	2001-03-05

It contains concise, single paragraph histories of the backgrounds of 8,000 words in our language.  One thing I really enjoy about it is the way it combines presentations of the most common, everyday words with the coolest, most interesting ones.<br />Offhand, one of my favorite words would have to be the word &quot;guitar.&quot;  Did you know that the word guitar started out as the Greek word &quot;kithara,&quot; and came to English by means of two separate routes?  On the one hand, it passed directly through Europe, by way of the Roman Empire, becoming &quot;cithara&quot; in Latin and then &quot;citole&quot; in Middle English.  On the other hand, it went through North Africa with the Muslims as a &quot;qitar&quot; in Arabic, then into Spanish by way of the Moors as &quot;guitarra,&quot; then into French as &quot;guitare,&quot; then finally into English as &quot;guitar.&quot;  (A citole, by the way, for all you non-Chaucer fans out there, was a medieval stringed instrument that we no longer have with us.)<br />That's just one word.  There are 7,999 more entries like that, and all of them are amazing.  This book is so worth the money it isn't even funny.  Two million thumbs up.	2001-02-22

Richard Hinkley Allen shares with us his research into the ancient names carried by our stars...   He delves into the etymologies of dozens, or more likely hundreds of stars, and also of constellations.  The book starts out with two brief sections discussing features of the Zodiac as a whole, then goes into great detail about each constellation in the sky, zodiacal or otherwise.  He draws upon mythology and folklore from the Chinese, Arabs, Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, Old Norse, Hebrews, Celts, many Native American peoples, Assyrians, etc...  There are a few problems with nineteenth century terminology for the modern reader, such as calling Mesopotamian peoples &quot;Euphratean,&quot; and frequently the spellings Allen uses are no longer accepted, but, well, I for one don't care about that.  This just a gem of a book, that's all there is to it.<br />If you're like me, you may find yourself startled at how many of the stars carry Arabic names, which Europe adapted in the later Middle Ages.  Somehow, that makes me wonder if that obscure fact could somehow help bring about some peace and mutual understanding between the West and the Islamic world...  Anyway, I wanted to also mention that if you happen to get really into this stuff, and want to do further research, you could do a lot worse than go online and try to contact a reference librarian at any good divinity school library.  That sounds funny, given that this book is about astronomy, and considering the traditional tensions between astronomy and religion, but if you can get access to such a library, you'll be able to leaf through mouldering old dictionaries of many ancient tongues.  Especially if the school has offerings in comparative religion.  Just a thought.  Keep looking up!	2001-02-22

This book contains many hieroglyphs, and offers translation keys, but...<br />Let me just warn people that real archaeologists, real Egyptologists don't have a whole lot of respect for the author of this book anymore. A lot of conventions in translation have sort of moved on since his time. In the movie &quot;Stargate,&quot; they make fun of him a little. They do this because, in the 21st century, people don't really use his writings anymore.  You need to be very careful of anything Budge says.<br />Look for &quot;Egyptian Grammar&quot; by Sir Alan Gardiner. That's the standard textbook, used by real Egyptologists.  The magazine KMT is good to know about, too. It's all about ancient Egypt, and is easy to find online.<br />If you enjoy this type of puzzle-solving, let me recommend a few titles. &quot;The Decipherment of Linear B,&quot; by John Chadwick,  &quot;Breaking the Maya Code&quot; by Michael Coe, and &quot;The Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries&quot; by David Ulansey are all still in print. &quot;Forgotten Scripts&quot; by Cyrus Gordon, and &quot;Voices in Stone&quot; by Ernst Doblhofer are harder to find, but if you ask your local librarian to search for them using interlibrary loan services, he or she will probably find them. It's really worth it... Also, there are still a few ancient scripts out there that no one has deciphered yet. The Indus Valley Script, the Easter Island Script, and the Meroitic script are three of them. The Meroitic script could shed light someday on the issue of how much contact there was between Ancient Egypt and pre-historic Africa. The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, at ..., has the best collection around on Meroe, and Meroitic, if anyone's interested. A good book for that script is &quot;Ancient African Civilizations,&quot; edited by Stanley Burstein, which contains several useful chapters.<br />Well, happy deciphering to you!	2001-02-22
US	52797729	R2GOKZ2MJ8SEAR	0064471071	671298565	The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (The Chronicles of Narnia, Book 5)	Books	5	10	12	N	N	The best of the series	Our old friends Lucy and Edmund Pevensie join their nerdy cousin Eustace, in this book, in a journey through a portrait of a ship, to the seas off the coast of Narnia.  There, they meet their old friend Prince Caspian, who is adventuring across the seas to explore the far reaches of his world.  He is also searching for a group of lost nobility from Narnia, who apparently had been marooned on various Narnian islands years before.  They all travel from island to island, and have many challenging adventures.<br />Of all the Narnia books, this is probably the one where C.S. Lewis gave himself the most freedom to just tell a story, without being &quot;in-your-face&quot; about the allegorical meanings of everything.  There IS a lot of allegory, but he makes it part of a story here, rather then constructing a story just as an excuse to make up a context for an allegory.  It's a terrific tale for children or adults.  Absolutely two thumbs up.<br />I just want to recommend a few books, for anyone who may be curious about what sources C.S. Lewis drew upon for this story.  I'll let you discover them for yourself, but the titles are: &quot;Phantom Islands of the Atlantic,&quot; by Donald S. Johnson, and &quot;New Worlds, Ancient Texts&quot; by Anthony Grafton.  Also -- if anyone's interested in learning about the cultural context of C.S. Lewis' personal problems with science education, which are pretty obvious in the way he talks about Eustace, then I recommend looking at &quot;The Two Cultures&quot; by C.P. Snow.  You'll see what I mean.	2001-02-21

He has never left the grounds of the estate in his entire life, being rather slow.  Yet, although he's not the brightest proverbial bulb on the proverbial Christmas tree, Chance is pleasant, polite, and anxious not to offend.  When he is thrust out into the world, due to the old man's unexpected demise, these traits serve him well.  People like him, automatically.  People trust him, instinctively.  Through a series of extremely unlikely coincidences, Chance finds himself hobnobbing with the president of the U.S., and giving him advice on economic matters, albeit in singularly vague terms.  His advise, however, does always seem to contain a sort of metaphorical wisdom, and before he knows what's happening, pundits are falling all over each other to be the one to interpret his oracular utterances.<br />This book claims to be a modern fable, discussing the power of the media to shape our notions of leadership, etc, but I think it speaks to a deeper issue -- the role of outsiders in general, and how we project our hopes and fears onto them.  It's also about a certain kind of fear, by which I mean the fear we all experience of having to admit to ourselves that we strongly suspect that nine times out of ten our elected officials are just full-court-bluffing their way through life, and are every bit as clueless and scared as the rest of us.  In this case, due to Chance's refreshingly childish innocence, the Emperor not only has no clothes, but he doesn't even understand that people want to BELIEVE that he does.<br />If anyone's interested in buying a similar sort of story for their children, I'd like to recommend the story &quot;Nazar the Brave,&quot; which is in a collection of Armenian folktales compiled and retold by Virginia Tashjian.  It's a great little story, just like &quot;Being There.&quot;  Two thumbs up.	2001-02-08

Speaking as a grandson of Guido and Katherine Agostinelli, I think I can speak with a certain amount of authority with regard to this cookbook when I say &quot;That's Italian.&quot;  Readers can be inspired by the photographs to try to improve their own culinary abilities.  Personally, I have been known to burn a bowl full of Raisin Bran, (don't ask, I can find a way, believe me,) but with this book I'm inspired to try all kinds of great recipes.<br />It's divided into sections on antipasti, pizzas, breads, pastas, risotti, soups, fish, poultry, meat, frittatas, seasonal vegetables, salads, cakes, cookies, and fruit desserts.  Every section is beautiful, inspiring, and ultimately delicious.  Two thumbs up.	2001-02-07
US	52797729	RD09IGFSX7WDP	0449208133	868223008	Lucifer's Hammer	Books	5	1	1	N	N	The most realistic book about the end of the world	This book is like a hard-hitting, non-supernatural version of Stephen King's &quot;The Stand.&quot; In it, the authors begin with the question &quot;what if the Earth were hit by a fairly large comet?&quot; What would happen? The strike portrayed here is somewhere between the Tunguska, Siberia meteor strike of 1908, and the K-t boundary disaster that probably is responsible for wiping out the dinosaurs. It is nearer in severity to the dinosaur-extinguishing event, but not AS bad. Still, the disaster portrayed here is awful enough to completely destroy Europe, the Eastern Seaboard of the U.S., coastlines worldwide, and much of the rest of the world. <br />The authors clearly spent some serious time thinking about all the possible ramifications of this catastrophe. This book goes a long way beyond the stereotypical apocalypse scenario of &quot;Well, we stocked the bomb shelter with enough canned goods to last for decades, but -- who was supposed to pack the can opener?!? We forgot!! Oh noooo!&quot; Niven and Pournelle painstakingly gamed out military, agricultural, social, psychological, and medical issues, among other problems. It's all realistic, too. Beyond the horror implicit in the basic premise, no extraneous horrific elements (such as Randall Flagg from &quot;The Stand&quot;) are brought in. They aren't needed.<br />A lot of people have commented that there is some serious racism in here.  They may be correct, but I'm not sure.  I think it's important to be cautious about accusing someone of racism.  There is a group of people who turn to ritualized cannibalism after the comet hits, when they are on the verge of famine, and many members of this group are African-american.  Not all of them, however -- there was also a battalion of soldiers, of mixed race, who were part of that group.  In fact, the guy that incites them to cannibalism is supposed to be white, I think.  It seems to me that the authors just wanted to have a group of people who went crazy, and turned to cannibalism.  There were two groups the authors used for this dramatic purpose, and one of the groups happened to be radical black urban guerillas -- don't forget, this was written in the mid-70s.  It seemed to me that they could just have easily have used any other fringe group -- take your pick.  Also, don't forget, there are several sympathetic black characters among the &quot;good guys.&quot;<br />My favorite part is the section where Dan Forester, the astrophysicist, tries to decide what books he should try to save, books with which to rebuild civilization. Think about that! What a conundrum. I would give a lot to have been a fly on the wall during the conversations between Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven that gave rise to this book. Just terrific, tremendous stuff. Two thumbs up.	2001-02-07

There is ample background, and the actual inscriptions are presented, and analyzed in considerable detail.  Its worth owning, if you're an archaeology buff.<br />Let me just warn people that real archaeologists, real Egyptologists don't have a whole lot of respect for the author of this book anymore.  A lot of conventions in translation have sort of moved on since his time.  In the movie &quot;Stargate,&quot; they make fun of him a little.  This is because people don't really use his writings anymore.  This book itself is okay as far as it goes, but you need to be very careful of what Budge says.<br />Look for &quot;Egyptian Grammar&quot; by Sir Alan Gardiner.  That's the standard textbook, used by real Egyptologists.  The magazine KMT is good to know about, too.  It's all about ancient Egypt, and is easy to find online.<br />If you enjoy this type of puzzle-solving, let me recommend a few titles.  &quot;The Decipherment of Linear B,&quot; by John Chadwick, &quot;Breaking the Maya Code&quot; by Michael Coe, and &quot;The Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries&quot; by David Ulansey are all still in print.  &quot;Forgotten Scripts&quot; by Cyrus Gordon, and &quot;Voices in Stone&quot; by Ernst Doblhofer are harder to find, but if you ask your local librarian to search for them using interlibrary loan services, he or she will probably find them.

Back in fifth grade, Miss McGowan read our class a chapter a day from this book for a few weeks.  For any schoolteachers out there -- this is a highly effective, and arguably educational, means of crowd control, if you're in charge of droves of unruly kids.  For any kids out there -- it was a good crowd control method because we LOVED it!  It's just a fantastic story, one that gets you thinking about many illogical features of the English language.  I bet a lot of writers got set on the road to being authors because of reading this book, when they were younger...<br />It's just a terrific story, about a kid named Milo who is given a mysterious tollbooth as a gift (yes, I'm serious.)  He drives through it in a toy car, enters a strange land, and before you know it he is immersed in a quest to restore Rhyme and Reason (two lost princesses) to the devastated, former &quot;Kingdom of Wisdom.&quot;  Everywhere he goes, he meets really weird creatures.  If you like to draw, it is a lot of fun to try to imagine what these creatures look like, and draw them.  Basically, this book is just an awful lot of fun.  You'll never forget it.  If you liked the movie &quot;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,&quot; you will love this book.  Two thumbs up.	2001-02-07

I took a single course in Indo-European Historical Linguistics back in college, and I really wanted to get more into Celtic languages.  I was intimidated, however, by the bizarre (albeit magical) LOOK of a printed page covered with Welsh, Irish, Breton, or what have you.  If I had known about this book, I would certainly have availed myself of it.  It helps to have studied some linguistics to really get a lot from this book, but you could work your way through it with a good dictionary of linguistics terminology.  One of the chief strengths of this book is the way it breaks things down so well -- the most difficult topics are laid out in bite-sized sections that are only two or three pages long.  I guess the closest thing I have to a criticism is the fact that only one example each is given of the Goidelic and Britonnic languages -- Irish and Welsh, respectively.  It's okay, though, they serve to get your feet wet, and then you could continue on with some other language if you felt like it.  The last hundred pages or so are devoted to more general grammatical topics.  Whoever reads this, let me just recommend to you that you make good use of the bibliographies at the end, especially the specialized academic journals that are mentioned.  Also, there are several terrfic listservs on the internet to help with any questions you might have in Celtic philology.  Just type in a few mix-and-match combinations of words like &quot;celtic,&quot; &quot;listserv,&quot; &quot;old irish,&quot; &quot;philology,&quot; &quot;middle welsh,&quot; etc. in the search terms field on any search engine, and you'll come up with some good listervs after, say, 3 or 4 tries.  It isn't that hard.  Anyway, this book is great.  Two thumbs up.	2001-01-07

Lovecraft was in a league of his own, so to speak.  There are a lot of flaws, from a literary point of view, in his stuff, but...  I just can't bring myself to care.  He had a style, and a set of preoccupations, that were so idiosyncratic, and so unique, that there's really no one you can compare him to.  Where else can you feast upon a steady diet of &quot;unimaginable horrors?&quot;  Where else do people go mad with such, well, maddening regularity?  In books by what other author, (including Carl Sagan,) do you find reference to things that happened &quot;vigintillions&quot; of years ago?<br />Some of his stories are actually FRIGHTENING, too, not just &quot;cool,&quot; if you know what I mean...  &quot;The Rats in the Walls&quot; gave me the willies.  I happen to live in Boston, and use the subway (the &quot;T&quot;) quite a lot, so &quot;Pickman's Model&quot; had a huge impact on me.  Most of his stuff, however, is much closer to science-fiction than horror, and if you want your mind expanded, you could do worse than read his work.  There's a lot of material dealing with non-Euclidean geometry, and alternate dimensions, among other topics.<br />Before I forget -- if you happen to be a younger reader, in a position where you are going to be facing SATs, PSATs, or some other standardized test sometime soon, then you can't knock reading H.P. Lovecraft as preparation for the verbal section.  He makes full use of an absolutely stupendous vocabulary.  You pick up awesome words without even realizing it's happening.  They just sink into your brain, not unlike a flesh-dissolving Shoggoth... I used to read a lot of Lovecraft (and also Joseph Heller's &quot;Catch-22&quot;) for vocabulary enrichment in high school, and I swear it's one of the primary reasons I scored in the 700s, way back when...  Two thumbs up.  Really good stuff.	2001-01-07
US	52797729	R27SBCVLARYKSU	0631215808	406717879	Languages in Britain and Ireland	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Very useful overview - not very in-depth, though	Each of the 19 sections of this book covers a different tongue, extinct or existing.  Usually about 10 pages are spent per language.  There are plenty of maps, for use in placing the exact distribution of whatever language you are reading about.  Also, there are decent bibliographies at the end of each article, providing a range of from about 3 to about 20 reference sources you could go to for further research.  This is why I gave this work five stars -- I don't think the editor was aiming to provide an absolutely comprehensive overview of all these languages, as, of course, would be impossible.  He tells us enough to whet our appetite, and to provoke a certain amount of wonder, and then he tells us where we could go to read more, if we want...  For me, the most interesting parts of this book are the little articles Glanville Price included about Flemish surviving as a spoken tongue in some parts of Wales, due to some Flemish knights settling there in the Middle Ages, and the articles about lesser-known Celtic tongues which survived almost to the present...  As it says in the blurb Amazon.com provides, the primary focii of these articles are historical, diachronic, and sociolinguistic.  I bought this book, and I'm pleased that I did.  I recommend it to anyone.	2001-01-07

As far as I know, this was never a movie, but, well, it should be, that's all I can say.  It is inspiring, exciting, interesting...  just an all-around amazing story.<br />One thing I wanted to mention -- why haven't more people commented on the intriguing possibility that Allan Gordon really might have found the remnants of the lost Greenland vikings?  That's the most interesting part of the story, for me.  A lost band of descendants of the vikings, travelling around Greenland with their lowered technological abilities, unable to make their way back home...  For my money, that's the coolest part of this story.  I wonder if it could be true.  If any kids are interested in this kind of thing, please look at these books -- &quot;The Penguin Historical Atlas of the Vikings,&quot; edited by John Haywood; or &quot;A History of the Vikings&quot; by Gwyn Jones.  These are both very interesting introductions to the viking era of history, which is actually FAR more completely understood, by people who study these things, than many people realize.	2000-12-26
US	52797729	R11EVW1YV9YHYD	0440407028	159056506	The Book of Three (Pyrdain Chronicles)	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Beautiful and moving	The &quot;Book of Three,&quot; and the stories which follow it, are all rightly considered to be classics of their genre.  I remember reading them for the first time, I believe it was during my summer vacation between second and third grade, and being totally absorbed.  I remember spending hours drawing crayon pictures of all the characters, and hanging them all over the house...  Every kid should have that experience.<br />A couple things I just want to point out.  If you are a child reading these for the first time, or an adult buying them for a child, please be careful about all the violence in these books.  Yes, violence is a part of the world, and it's good to prepare kids to think about it, but...   As a parent reading this to your kids, maybe you could offset it a little, with stories about heroic figures who aren't so intent to wield a sword.  For example, a good children's version of Plutarch's &quot;Lives&quot; will include a description of Archimedes, the absent-minded professor who was centuries ahead of his time in the physical sciences.  Now that's what I call a hero!  Or read to them about musicians, maybe.  Why not?  Fantasy doesn't always have to be about bloody combat.<br />Beyond that, be aware that these stories are based on real legends, and real (or at least POSSIBLY real, at one time) characters (Gwydion, Arawn, etc.) from Celtic-speaking Wales, which today is in the western part of the United Kingdom, AKA Great Britain.  In fact, if you whisper the word &quot;Prydain,&quot; and then whisper the word &quot;Britain&quot; you will see that they are the same word.  It's true, Prydain was an early way to spell and pronounce what today we call &quot;Britain.&quot;  If any kids, or adults are interested, the most important book you should read to follow up on an interest in this body of Celtic mythology is, without question, &quot;The Mabinogion,&quot; which also includes one of the earliest known authentic versions of the King Arthur tales.  Or, doa search on Amazon.com for any book called &quot;The Celts.&quot; There are several with that title, and all the ones I've seen are decent introductions to the Celts, including the Celts of Wales (who are called &quot;Welsh,&quot; for any younger fellow Americans who might not know that) and their mythological figures.<br />Anyway, these stories are incredibly cool.  Worth owning, without a doubt.  Two thumbs up.	2000-12-26
US	52797729	R1VPN051J4KSB0	0380815958	389698011	The Relaxation Response	Books	5	75	80	N	N	Woo Hoo!	This is worth the money to own -- it's so, so worth it...  I did another review once for a somewhat similar book -- &quot;The Quiet Mind,&quot; by White Eagle.  That is a more explicitly &quot;spiritual&quot; book than this one, full of little aphoristic sayings that often refer to God, or &quot;the light&quot;...  I still like that book, but I wanted to speak up in favor of this approach to having a quiet mind, also.  &quot;The Relaxation Response&quot; is really quite short and to-the-point, and has a fundamentally Western, rational, scientific feel to it.  The end goal is very similar to White Eagle's book, however.  Herbert Benson helps us to know the value of taking just ten or fifteen minutes each day to breathe, to say your private mantra over and over, and to simply Be...  I think a lot of people out there have some pretty flaky mental associations with the word &quot;mantra.&quot;  People immediately think of the Beatles saying &quot;heavy, man&quot; and binging in a huge way on LSD-laced mandarin oranges, or some similar image.  Benson shows that meditation need not be like this.  A mantra could be basically any simple, calming phrase -- anything that doesn't provoke fitful spasms of hysterical laughter is probably fine.  <br />One example of a poor choice of a mantra would be &quot;get... get... get... out... out... out...&quot; like hockey mask-wearing Jason in the &quot;Friday the Thirteenth&quot; movies.   A better one might be something calming, such as &quot;decaf for me, please... decaf for me, please... decaf for me, please...&quot; or, better still, the name of a beloved childhood pet.  That's what I use, the name of the dog we owned when I was a kid, and it works for me.  You can use a pleasant-sounding nonsense word if you want, also.  Furthermore, it isn't necessary to be given a mantra in a personalized, ritualistic fashion by a personal guru, like many TM practioners used to advocate in the 70s.  It's okay to pick your own, whatever works foryou, a lot of those gurus were just a bunch of frauds.<br />This book is worth owning, for the further calming effect of being able to view the author's helpfully compiled graphs, and his discussions of the experimental sessions that led to his understanding of the essence of meditation.  What he is basically going to tell you to do, however, is simply to take a few minutes a day to sit comfortably, breathe in and out, chant quietly, and try to let your mind empty itself out.  Emptying the mind of extraneous thoughts is not meant to feel like wringing water out of a wet washcloth, either -- it should feel like leaving the washcloth hanging loosely over a clothesline, and letting the water, the thoughts, drip to the ground below of their own, unhurried accord, for just fifteen tranquil minutes a day.  I wish I had discovered this book years ago.  Two mellow thumbs up -- check this one out.	2000-12-26

This is an interesting book in its way, and I do think it's worth reading, but after you finish reading it, please think about this, whoever reads this...<br />If these characters are such geniuses, and so preoccupied with love, then why aren't they trying to find a cure for cancer?  Wouldn't that be an act of love???  Why aren't they working with impoverished children, giving them an education?  Why aren't they working to develop safe places for people to live, in case there's a nuclear war?  It's because they are a couple of self-absorbed, rich, elitist jerks who don't think about how preposterously, INCREDIBLY lucky they are to have been born to parents who chose to live in a city with bookstores or libraries that even HAVE of the books they quote so freely.   Also, they can get away with making boredom and ennui look theatrically sexy.  Big deal.  They should spend some time in the Peace Corps, or Teach for America, or distributing food at a camp in Ethiopia to starving babies.  Wake up, Franny and Zooey, you absolute, total, complete, overwhelming losers.  Get out in the world and help someone else, that's the only way you'll understand what love is.

The basic story Richard Deacon is investigating here is an old legend, that America may have been reached in the year 1170 A.D. (the year Henry II apparently had Thomas a Becket slain in Canterbury Cathedral), by a Welsh prince named Madoc.  This is one of those tales that is just so exciting that people seem to latch onto it, and draw upon it for their need for Mystery in life.  People who want it to be true call the legend &quot;controversial.&quot;  People who disagree with it call it &quot;a heap of rubbish.&quot;  Deacon's survey of the evidence is cooler-headed than many books out there, although he does ultimately want the tale to be true.  He talks about the Mandan tribe of North Dakota in a fairly dispassionate way -- they, for the record, are brought forth most often as candidates for being the descendants of Prince Madoc's colonists.  Some authors start from a point of being convinced that this story is true, and write in a very angry way.  You can almost hear them yelling at the detractors of their legend.  Deacon does not do this, and his book is basically quite informative.  I also recommend looking at the cover story in the January 2000 edition of the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, and at the fictional work &quot;Children of First Man&quot; by James Thom, a speculative tale of what the lives of these putative settlers may have been like.

She employs beautiful, descriptive passages describing a range of experiences which derive much of their value from being experienced in solitude: a walk in the woods, drawing a picture, dreaming a lazy dream...  Her story leaves one with an experience of the importance of privacy, of having an alone place in your life, and of turning, sometimes, away from the quotidian world of other people and even of sensory input, and finding out how to be still and centered.  She seems to be implying that, in some paradoxical ways, the most powerful common experience we can share as human beings is the experience of reflective solitude.   <br />She sets all of this in the context of a society of clones.  I should say that this society reminds me a lot of the &quot;Borg&quot; from Star Trek, while noting, of course, that Kate Wilhelm's story was written long before the idea of the Borg occurred to anyone.  The clone society concept lets her do all kinds of complex, intriguing things with her ideas, but these actual ideas are quite simple in and of themselves.  Simple, important, and worth reading.  This book is terrific.  Two thumbs up.	2000-12-04
US	52797729	RF56YYR9UNLYN	1561004804	474714897	The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Very important book	Any story that makes us all think about what it's like to be a lost little kid trying to make friends and find a home in an incredibly dangerous, deceitful, treacherous world has my full support.  This book suffers from a lot of 19th century racism, etc, but the basic feel of it is good for us all to mull over, I think.  That's why it's so timeless...  Please read it.	2000-11-29

I want to make a small correction, in case I confused anyone.  The book I recommended looking at, if you can find a copy, is &quot;Off the Beaten TRACK in the Classics,&quot; not &quot;Off the Beaten PATH....&quot;  The author is C. Kaeppel, and it was published in Melbourne, Australia, in 1936.	2000-11-16

Speaking as a native New Englander, I feel like I've seen enough terrific-looking towns that I can appreciate a really beautiful village.  The ones photographed in this book are spectacular.  This really is a great coffee table book.  The colors in the photos just draw the eye in.  It's hard to describe...  You will see a whole village of ancient stone buildings, with rock walls in a sort of dusky brown, and suddenly, off to the side, a brightly colored painted boat.  Or maybe just a little flower garden, with lots of little Manet-esque red blossoms.  And the architecture, or course, is uniformly, yet diversely, amazing.  Roman, medieval, and (slightly) more modern, it all just fits together so beautifully.   Furthermore, the whole book is full of cool little articles talking about historically interesting tidbits of history, legend, etc. from the region.<br />Also -- if anyone who enjoys this book has reading ability in French, I'd like to recommend &quot;La Langue Gauloise&quot;, by P.Y. Lambert.  It talks about the original language of France, &quot;Gaulish&quot;, an early Celtic tongue, from before the days of Caesar and friends.  I think that one of the intriguing things about Brittany is that this original, pre-Romance-languages tongue of the region was largely reinstated, in the 5th and 6th centuries A.D., by Celtic-speaking refugees when Britain was being overrun by the Germanic-speaking Angles and Saxons.  I think it's interesting to look at the place names in Brittany, and try to learn whether they were named back in prehistoric times, or in the era since the 5th and 6th century.  This is the kind of question that this book raises -- the concatenated sense of sedimentary century laid upon century, laid upon century, is absolutely enthralling.	2000-11-16

Here's my take on it --<br />Some Good Qualities: 1.)It really is a pretty comprehensive REFERENCE SOURCE.  I say this to draw a contrast, in some ways, with its value as a TUTORIAL.  More on that later...<br />2.)I liked the models for writing web pages.  If you use this feature, and also get in the habit of using the &quot;view page source&quot; on your browser, you are on a productive path for learning HTML.<br />3.)Detail, detail, detail...  A lot of the stuff the authors talk about, they talk about EXHAUSTIVELY, with the notable exceptions of META tags, Cascading Style Sheets, and javascripting.  Apart from those flaws, there usually is more detail than most people would even need, which of course is a good thing.  Better too much detail than not enough.<br />Some Poor Qualities: 1.)It's very dry.  Obviously you shouldn't be expecting excitement on the level of, say, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;, but even without lurid sex and/or violence, or, for example, the wit of Steve Martin, it seems like this could have been more engrossing.  Just my opinion.<br />2.)This is sort of an extension of my last point, but...  I think it's a little too heavy on the terminology for a beginners guide.  Of course, you do need to learn it at some point, but that's part of what made it slow going in some ways.  If you already have some experience with the world of HTML, you won't be slowed down by this kind of thing, but if you're coming to it fresh this makes for very slow reading, and it becomes difficult to remain alert to what the authors are trying to get across.  This is what I meant before when I said that this is a valuable reference source, but imperfect as a tutorial.<br />3.)The treatment of META tags, Cascading Style Sheets, and javascripting could have been a lot better.	2000-11-05

Tiiiimes	If my review title makes you scratch your head and say to yourself, &quot;hmmm, where do I know that from?&quot;, you should really buy this book.  (It's from Styx.)  Anyway, this book is a little tongue in cheek, obviously, but it does more than just make fun of Tommy Tutone, Bananarama, The Human League, songs like 867-5309 Jenny, etc.  It has dozens of little quizzes, where you see the lines from songs on one page, and then when you flip to the next page you find out the names of the groups that sang them.  Interspersed throughout the book are tons of little articles (blurbs, really) about various groups, which tell you, in all likelihood, more than any human would ever want to know about, say, Spandau Ballet.  But it's still a good book.  I recommend the living daylights out of this one, it's hilarious, especially at parties.	2000-11-05

It begins with a few pages, organized in a separate row for each division of (first) a few hundreds of thousands of years, in the Stone Age; then every few hundred years, during the age of Sumer and Egypt; every few years, as you leaf through the days of Greece, Rome, the Dark Ages, the Renaissance, and eventually it works up to having multiple entries in each category for every single year that goes by.   I should note that this not nearly as eurocentric as my last few sentences might suggest -- there's plenty of material about developments in China, the empires of Songhay, Mali, etc. in Africa, the Islamic world, the Incas and Aztecs, and so on.<br />The headings include Anthropology/Archaeology, Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, Mathematics, Medicine, Physics, and Technology.  The book is subdivided into several sections --<br />1.) Science before there were scientists: 2,400,000-599 B.C.<br />2.) Greek and Hellenistic science: 600 B.C. -- 529 A.D.<br />3.) Science in many lands and medieval science: 530 -- 1452<br />4.) The Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution: 1453 -- 1659<br />5.) The Newtonian Epoch: 1660 -- 1734<br />6.) The Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution: 1735 -- 1819<br />7.) Nineteenth century science: 1820 -- 1984<br />8.) Science in the twentieth century through World War II:  1895 -- 1945<br />9.) Science after World War II: 1946 -- 1988<br />10.) The coming era: 1989 -- 2000  (Yes, 1988 is the last year that this book covers.  I don't know why they haven't updated it.  This is a flaw, of course, but I stand by my five star ranking, because anything that recent can be looked up on the internet, etc.)<br />Each section is prefaced by a helpful essay, to place matters in context.  Also, there are many small &quot;boxes&quot; interspersed throughout the text, to give more complete information on particular figures.<br />I don't think this book has quite as much material as Bernard Grun's &quot;Timetables of History&quot;, but it's layout is better, and more helpful.  I think this book is worth having.	2000-11-05

Look at some selections from the table of contents, and see if it whets your appetite.  Old Babylonian Sky Lore...  Assyrian Astrology...  Chaldaean Tables (of the stars)...  Gree Poets and Philosophers...  Arabian Astronomy...  Copernicus...  Kepler...  Newton...<br />If this is the kind of thing that floats your proverbial boat, you could do a lot worse than this book.  It really is very beautifully written, too -- if you happen to be familiar with, and enjoy, Olaf Stapledon's writing style, you'll find this to be very pleasing.  You might want to keep a dictionary of astronomical terms handy, if you are someone who loves the drama of the historical clash of Science versus Dogma, but aren't necessarily that familiar with words like &quot;azimuth&quot;, &quot;declination&quot;, etc.  Also, if you like this, you may want to seek out the jourrnal &quot;Isis&quot;, which specializes in the study of the history of science.	2000-11-05

This book is a collection of dozens of little 2-4 page essays, dealing with myriad personal topics in his life, which amounts to a history of the very field of science fiction, in a lot of ways.  He gives his account of his dealings with a lot of the other luminaries in the field -- Arthur C. Clarke, Robert Heinlein, Hal Clement, Lester del Ray, and lots of others.  These accounts are always interesting, and often full of helpful little insights into the characters of other science fiction writers.<br />One interesting thing -- he says that he had no ability at all to be a critic, in the sense that he couldn't criticize his own work, or anyone elses.  He knew if he liked it or not, but that's as far as it went.  For me, that was probably the most telling little essay in the whole book.  The only author in history to have authored books classified in every single section of the Dewey Decimal system, one of the most prolific writers EVER, simply had no inner critic.  He just wrote, and wrote, and wrote.  Anyone else out there who finds that interesting, and possibly helpful to them somehow, might want to check out &quot;Writing Without Teachers&quot; by Peter Elbow, or, relatedly, &quot;Flow&quot; by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.  (Yes, I'm serious about the spelling of that guy's name).<br />You also get a clear sense of Isaac Asimov's strong sense of self-respect, and his fundamental optimism about humanity, and his warmth.  I'm glad his voice is still out there, on the printed page, reaching more people even after he has passed on.	2000-11-04

I agree with what other reviewers are saying about how it's sort of divided into two parts, an autobiography and a guide to writing.  I just want to add, though, that you also get a really detailed account of how he conceived the ideas for &quot;Carrie&quot; and &quot;The Stand&quot;, among other things.  If you're like me, and you like to have specifics rather than vagaries, those parts have a lot of REALLY valuable tips.  You walk away from this book really energized, I know it's certainly helped ME anyway.  I just want to mention one other, less well known book that has some good tips, and that book is &quot;I. Asimov&quot; by Isaac Asimov.  It has a lot of the same good qualities that this book has -- plain speaking; hard headed advice about writing; and also it carries the imprint of the writers personality, which shows what a personal investment the author made in it.  Absolutely worth looking at.	2000-11-04

There's a lot of very shaky, pseudo-mystical scholarship about the Celts out there.  This, however, is a book you can trust.  If you're into the Celts, or if you're a classicist interested in broadening your knowledge base, you could do a lot worse than this book.  Also, if you're looking for real information about the Celts, look for the website for the Institute for Advanced Studies in Dublin.  They have a School of Celtic Studies there, and everything they print can be considered a legitimate, authoritative source of information.  Also, if you do pick up this book, you'll be getting a stupendous bibliography for your money, which could easily constitute a guide to a lifetime of reading on this subject.  Two thumbs up.	2000-10-18

I first saw this book in a film version, which was being used at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington when I was about nine years old. It had a huge impact upon me. I will never forget the feeling of understanding the universe that this film gave me. Anyone with \\"math fear\\" can benefit from this -- it makes vast numbers not only comprehensible, but fascinating. This can make a terrific coffee table book, or something to leave around in a school library setting. <br />It is difficult to overstate how effective a teaching tool this book can be. I'm not kidding. If you are a primary school science or math teacher, you OWE it to the children you teach to get a copy of this. You will be doing them a disservice if you don't expose them to this. I'm not exaggerating, the book is just amazing. My rating -- 37 quadrillion thumbs up.	2000-10-18

One thing many reviewers seem to be overlooking is the simple beauty of LeGuin's writing.  She employs a simple, almost monosyllabic vocabulary, to give her tale the feel of a song, or a poem.  Compare her use of language to, for example, the frenzied addiction to long-winded, Latin-derived vocabulary used by Poe, and you will see why her writing conveys an almost mythic calm.  I also like the way she has such beautiful sentence structure -- many sentences are like terraced waterfalls, with the reader's mind tumbling lazily down a series off steplike prepositional phrases.  If you want to study writing, and the use of language, you could do a heck of a lot worse than start with this book.  <br />The story is of a young man's growth to wisdom.  There is Taoism as well as Jungian ideas all through this story -- if you can get a copy, (which would have been very difficult if you live in a small town, until Amazon.com and its competitors came along), I recommend picking up the &quot;Tao te Ching&quot;, by Lao-Tzu.  You will recognize many quotations from this story.<br />You can have a lot of fun with this story, and hopefully get a lot out of it.  Check it out!	2000-10-12

You won't be mistaken.  Odell Shepard presents a work of such thorough, painstaking scholarship, it should be held up as a model for what scholarship ought to be.  In fact, you get a pretty good sense of the history of scholarliness itself, reading this.  If you find yourself sort of hypnotized by the excitement of looking over the shoulders of centuries worth of savants, I recommend you also read anything by Anthony Grafton, who writes about issues in the history of Renaissance scholarship.  Another thing -- what a beautiful writing style this Odell Shepard possesses.  His prose is characterized by an exacting usage of language (languages, I should say, because he apparently has a fluency with Latin, Greek, French, Italian, and probably other languages as well), and also by a taste for baroque, nineteenth century sentence structure.  Really beautiful stuff.  He loves his subject, and he loves the way it has been handed down through the ages.  Two thumbs up.	2000-10-08

I thought I might be able to capture some of the fun that math games can entail.  This book does the job.  Bear in mind, these exercises are for YOUNGER children, up to 3rd grade or so.  The authors are full of ideas, and seem to have a grasp both of child psychology, and the trials of parenting.  The parenting part doesn't apply to me at this point, but I hope to be able to pass on some of the fun spirit these guys infuse their book with.<br />Hey, whoever is reading this -- you might want to think about sharing this book with someone in your life who couldn't afford it, when you're finished getting ideas from it.  Or even more than one person -- go on a parenting listserv and talk about the book, and pass the word along.  Maybe you have a poor cleaning woman who comes to your house, and only speaks Spanish.  You could try to share a few of the games with her, if she has kids, and show her how her kids might benefit if she played these games with them.  Think about it.  It can only help.	2000-10-08
US	52797729	R1WFUUQFINS2YH	0380791854	299110267	Lathe of Heaven	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Rewarding and Memorable	Ursula LeGuin has so much &quot;on the ball&quot; it's almost frightening.  This book is all about the way dreams shape our world, (they really do, if you think about it -- America was FOUNDED on dreams), and also about when dreaming can become problematic.  Her hero has the gift/curse of being able to change the physical universe by dreaming, and because his dreams come from his unconsious mind, he has no control over them whatsoever.  He seems to find that maybe it's best just to sort of muddle through, not basing his world-transforming dreams on judgments about whether things are absolutely optimal or not...  It's funny, but if you read studies on the nature of creativity, they tend to agree with what she's saying.  If you can relax the mind and let things just come to you, your dreams and ideas will flow a heck of a lot more naturally than if you try to force them into some mold.  And they won't be very negative dreams either, they'll be useful to you and to others.<br />Also, this book is just PACKED with Taoism, just like her Earthsea trilogy.  If you study this at all, you'll find that the way she uses Taoism to work against regimented social planning actually has had many real life counterparts which have occurred over the centuries in China.  There have always been major philosophical differences there between the philosophically free-spirited Taoists and the hard-nosed, state-centered Confucianists, and of course the Buddhists have always fit in in various complex ways too. In a funny way, this book can be a good introduction to a lot of people to the ways issues have historically been framed in that part of the world.  China is expected to become a more familiar part of America's world as time goes by, so maybe this book can play a part in that.  Just a thought.  If anyone's interested, &quot;A Concise History of China&quot; by J.A.G. Roberts is a good introduction to Chinese history -- you'll see what I mean.<br />And beyond all that, the woman knows howto tell a story.  Whew.  Two thumbs up.	2000-10-08

Donald Johnson takes us exploring some of the cooler little nooks and crannies of history, and we walk away greatly enriched.  These are the kinds of tales that would make fantastic campfire-side telling.  One of my favorites is the tale of &quot;Frisland&quot;.  If you do an online search for the phrase &quot;Westford Knight&quot; on Altavista.com, Hotbot.com, Yahoo.co, or whatever search engine you prefer, you will find a re-telling of the legend with which this island is associated.  There is a book by Frederick Pohl, the respected science fiction author, called &quot;Prince Henry Sinclair: His Expedition to the New World in 1398&quot;, which tells this story in more detail.  The town Westford, MA actually has an old carving on a rock by the side of the highway that looks like a knight, and the town government has allowed a plaque to be put up next to it, telling the story of how Sinclair and his knights voyaged to Newfoundland, and later may have made their way to Massachusetts.  Who knows if it's really true, but the carving COULD be a knight.<br />And that's just one of the stories.  There are seven here, and each one is enthralling.  Absolutely worth it.	2000-10-07

I found myself walking around, oblivious to the world around me, completely preoccupied with his ideas, for many months.   Many of them do seem possible, too.<br />Just be careful what you believe, reader.  Yes, some of this stuff might be true.  Also, I applaud anyone out there who's mind is awake enough to even care about this kind of thing.  Not everyone would read a book like this.  Still, his arguments sometimes do have holes.  The stone chambers in New England, which he feels were made by pre-Columbian Celts, were most likely created by colonial farmers.  A lot of very serious archaeologists, who really know what they're talking about, have studied the New England stuff in depth, and they tend to disagree with Dr. Fell.  <br />Some of his conclusions really might hold water though.  I want him to be right.  Some of his ideas about Algonquin, American place names deriving from age-old Celtic words are particularly exciting to me.  There is a highly respected archaeologist at the University of Calgary, a Dr. David Kelley, who believes some of Fells ideas are correct.  For perspective, it is useful to know that this same Dr. Kelley supported various ideas about the nature of Mayan hieroglyphics at a time when the &quot;establishment&quot;, such as it was, was totally against them.  Time proved Kelley right on that matter -- perhaps he is correct about this as well.  I hope he is.  Just don't be TOO credulous, whoever reads this.  For some reason Barry Fells ideas seem to have given him an almost cult-like following.  Don't be a cult member.  Some people just have a knee-jerk negative reaction to anything &quot;the establishment&quot; says, but there IS no establishment, archaeology is a field of study, and if Dr. Fells ideas are right, time will prove him to be so.  Just try to think through what he says, and if you have the means, maybe do a little investigating on your own.<br />Other sources of information you might want to look at would include the cover article in the January 2000 edition of the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, or &quot;Columbus was Last&quot; by Patrick Huyghe.  I think &quot;Columbus was Last&quot; is out of print, but if you can find it through inter-library loan, or online, I would encourage you to do so.  Huyghe presents Fells arguments, and many others, supporting the idea of pre-Columbian contact between America and Europe or Asia.  Also, his book has a terrific bibliography, for further reading.<br />I just finally wanted to say that I disagree with people who politicize Fell's ideas.  He isn't demeaning native American cultures by implying that a few tiny, obscure elements of them may once have originated in Europe.  Every culture in the world has impurities in that sense -- our own language, English, is probably the biggest hodgepodge of intercultural linguistic borrowings in the world.   My final comment would be to be careful that you don't get completely swayed by Fell's way of presenting his ideas.  He BELIEVES he is right, in a very strong way, and this had an impact on his objectivity on many levels.  Just be careful reading this, and join me in HOPING he's right, for the sheer coolness of his ideas.	2000-10-07
US	52797729	R2HI3AM20N0W0T	0345359321	486440079	Travels	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Wow	This is a consistently intriguing collection of autobiographical sketches.  Mr. Crichton has done some serious travelling in his time, around our planet, and also inward, metaphorical travels.  His journeys are either to rarely visited geographical locales (such as various obscure Himalayan kingdoms, pre-massacre Rwanda,  Hong Kong...) or to even more rarely visited, X-Files-ish  states of mind,  where spoons are bent with sheer concentration, the human aura is visible, and the future can be seen.  <br />I wasn't sure what I thought about some of the more mystical explorations he undertakes here, but the older I get, the more open-minded I am to things like that.  He really comes across as being honest, and quite psychologically perceptive.  If you liked his novel  &quot;Sphere&quot;, this will give you a sense of the kind of thought processes that gave rise to the interesting ending of that story.  Also, I should say, if you liked &quot;Congo&quot;, be on the lookout for various scenes here that clearly influenced the writing of that book.  I won't give them away here...<br />In general, I have to say that many of the more spiritual components of this book are some of the most accessible, interesting, and provocative passages on the nature of consciousness I've ever had the pleasure of reading.  He makes you really think about the mind, and how we use it, or fail to use it.  He uses plain, unacademic language to describe experiences that are too often shrouded in mumbo-jumbo words like &quot;epistemelogical&quot; or &quot;phenomenological&quot;.  Anyone can read this book, and anyone who thinks about it can profit from it.  Two thumbs up.	2000-10-06

The illustrations are beautiful, for one thing, but the premise behind the book is absolutely fantastic.  Dixon dares to conjecture about what future forms life might take on, given a few million more years of evolution.  His results are always intriguing, and the reader is left with a strong sense of him-or-her self as being in the MIDDLE of the process of evolution, not at its end.  If you are still in school; if you have children; or if, like me, you just hope to have children someday, you ought to just pick thi ( ) up right now.  It causes you to look with new eyes at the fauna around you -- pigeons, chipmunks, dogs, birds...  what evolutionary forces are acting on them RIGHT NOW?  What impact might those forces have, given a few million years to work their magic?  Would a new kind of dog develop?  Perhaps one with... oh, I don't know, maybe a rainbow-colored dog with wings, suited by evolution for survival due to camoflage ability  in urban areas with centuries of accumulated graffiti.  And the wings, perhaps developed as a mutation, might let it flee the area more quickly in case of a nuclear attack.  (The author mostly deals with pastoral, natural terrain, not post-nuclear-holocause wastelands, for the record).  I am kidding about the dog, of course, but these are the sort of things that you will find yourself preoccupied by, after leafing through this beautiful text.  Definitely worth it.	2000-10-05

It has been a short story, a novel, a movie, a Broadway play, and (I think) forms the basis for the 70s song &quot;What's it all about...  Char-liiieeeeeee...&quot;   Daniel Keyes drew upon Plato's cave allegory for a lot of the basic structure of the tale. ..<br />Keep a box of kleenex beside you as you read this.  Charlie Gordon is a retarded man in his 30s, who is selected to be the subject of a new, highly experimental technique which will triple his &quot;intelligence&quot;.  What he does with the intelligence, and how he deals with it, are up to him, and he certainly runs into a lot of problems.   I think in some ways, Keyes is not only writing about the relationship of the individual to capital-K &quot;knowledge&quot;, but also about how we can get along with each other when we are all at different levels.  Charlie's newfound, firey compassion for others in his old position, e.g. a retarded boy working in a restaurant who gets mocked, is compelling.  You will want to meet Charlie Gordon, you can't help but respect hm as he grapples with major human issues...  I first read this as a child, I would guess I was 9 or 10, and at that age I was most impressed with the &quot;coolness&quot; of the idea -- you can watch Charlie's intelligence climb steadily as he improves his spelling with each successive &quot;progris riport&quot; he writes.  As an adult, I appreciate the different models of Mind that Keyes was playing with here, and how Charlie comes face to face with one human problem after another.  The story also has a lot to say about the basic human drive to understand the universe and his place in it.  I think this book could be quite inspiring to people with learning disabilities -- the image of Charlie totally flunking out of school, but then years later sitting still in a library, flipping pages of books at one page/second as he reads about the etymology of ancient languages, Hindu history, calculus, etc...   It's just so inspiring.  Good things happen to him because of his will to keep pushing himself, but also because he is naturally thoughtful, even when retarded, and likes to be reflective....  The ending will make you cry, I guarantee it.  I was sort of reminded of the servant that Caesar used to take through the streets with him, when on parade, whose job it was to keep whispering in Caesar's ear &quot;remember that you are mortal&quot;.  Charlie is mortal too, and as his newfound brilliance wanes, and breaks down in the end, the reader is left feeling bewildered at the magnitude of the loss, and confused as to what to do with all the energy this book stirs up.  I'm not sure what Keyes wanted us to do with that energy -- maybe turn it inwards, maybe use it to reach out to others... probably a little of each.  Please read this story, and just mull it over a little.  You won't regret it.	2000-10-04

In the age that we live in, described so well in James Gleick's &quot;Faster&quot;, who among us could not use a reminder to slow down, breathe, and have a little inner peace?  I myself have long been subject to panic attacks, and this book has helped me out on numerous occasions.  I recommend keeping it next to your bed, ideally somewhere near your head so it's easier to reach for if you ever wake up suddenly out of a nightmare.  This is a lot like Kahlil Gibran's stuff, but I like White Eagle better.  He is less in-your-face about his mysticism, and really tries to help people.  Basically every page of this book has, I would say, at least three little nuggets of wisdom that most of us would never think of on our own.  That reminds me -- when I was a kid, I used to have a lot of fun playing &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot;.  I always had a hard time, however, understanding the difference between &quot;intelligence&quot; and &quot;wisdom&quot;, both of which are qualities a character in that role-playing game must display...  If I had this book available to me then, I strongly suspect that I would have had a much better understanding of the difference between those qualities, and of how important that difference is for happiness...  You really should check this one out, O Reader.	2000-09-28

It makes one wonder what future historians, if we have much  of a future, would choose to place in a description of the year we are in  now...  Look at the &quot;daily life&quot; column of each year, while you  leaf through this.  A lot of the most unexpected surprises are in that  column...  Also, it is quite an experience to choose some period of history  about which you might be relatively poorly informed, and just leaf through  the appropriate pages.  I chose the 7th century A.D., as a time that, to my  mind at least, was a virtually total blank.  Before I knew it, I found  myself going to the library, reading up on the precursors to the  Merovingians in France; the kings of Wessex in England; the origins of  Islam; the re-settlement of Britanny by Celtic peoples; the early medieval  popes...  and not only that, it really is a pretty global book.  There is a  lot of stuff, throughout the book,  on the African empires of Songhay and  Mali; the various Chinese dynasties; the bloody adventures of Timurlaine;  the flowering and eventual decay of the Mayans...  I suspect that this  might have some value to a PhD candidate in history, or a writer of  historical fiction, but its real value lies in its ability to just open the  eyes of the average person to the sheer wealth and breadth of history.  Two  thumbs up, and I'm trying to make my big toes go &quot;up&quot; too, just  for emphasis.	2000-09-18

I'm kind of a student of this type of book, because I'd like to write my own thrillers one of these days. People reading this, by the way, might want to click on the \\"See more editorial reviews\\" button on the first page of this collection of reviews, because Lincoln Child actually posted a little comment there himself, where he talks about the genesis of this project...<br />For about the first 300 pages, tension just builds and builds, while the scientist Margo Green, the journalist Smithback, and the \\"odd couple\\" of law enforcement officials D'Agosta and Pendergast pursue various leads. They are trying to investigate the sudden occurence of several murders, and how they connect to a mysterious ancient relic from an isolated, almost mythic tribe (the Kathoga) from the Amazonian rainforest. They all go down various wrong trails in their search for the truth, seeking a human serial killer; a \\"curse\\"; or even the premise they ultimately base their conjectures upon, which is that the \\"Museum Beast\\" is a paleozooic creature, dating back millions of years. The wrong trails somehow heighten the tension -- this is a favored plot device of Michael Crichton, whom the authors state that they admire, so maybe that's where the idea came from. Anyway, in the background, a huge, gala party is gearing up to take place at the museum, and the museum administrators, who are keenly aware of the importance of this party to the museum's financial survival, are constantly getting in the way of the investigations, slowing them down at every step, so the pesky murders won't get in the way of their party. What finally (gorily?) happens to these administrators, I will leave it to the reader to gleefully imagine.<br />Anyway, at the gala event, all hell breaks loose, and the characters are split up into small groups for a long time. This allows the authors to switch back and forth between the events happening around various separate groups of characters, which is a well-tried approach to heightening tension. They are left wholly to their own devices with no electricity in the building, a wild storm raging outside, and a gigantic, agile, armor-plated carnivorous monster from hell dogging their every step. Quite a party, hmmm?!?! <br />I liked the ending a lot too -- some reviewers here seem to disagree, but it worked for me. Basically, this is just a really scary novel, combing elements of horror, thrillers, detective fiction, and cutting edge science. Worth the money.	2000-09-16
US	52797729	RL47X6R9Y3QCJ	0345342968	383457570	Fahrenheit 451	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Unforgettable	This is a profound book indeed, and I don't know how I can hope to do it  justice.  I think in many ways, Ray Bradbury is after us to think about  happiness, and when we are better off being unhappy.  This comes up several  times -- the twisted, tragically fallen Fire Captain Beatty calls his  firemen &quot;The Happiness Boys&quot; because they make melancholy and  thoughtfulness more difficult, by burning literature.  Later, when the hero  -- Montag, the book-burning fireman who begins to question his job --  confronts his wife's friends, he tries as hard as possible to make them  UNhappy about their boring lives, in the hope that it will wake them up to  the world around them...  The very first sentence of the book states  &quot;It was a pleasure to burn&quot;, referring to Montag before he begins  to wake up, and become an unhappy,  sympathetic human being...  Bradbury is  getting at some important things here, such as how we can be most peaceful  inside when we are questioning, when we are not happy.  Older readers might  want to think about reading John Milton's &quot;L'Allegro&quot; and  &quot;Il Penseroso&quot; to flesh out their own personal response to this  book.  I think younger readers, who could be reading this for school, might  be interested in renting the movie &quot;Logan's Run&quot;.  Both stories  are about future societies, where order and happiness are maintained by  weeding out anyone who seems capable of independent thought.  In this  story, that means burning all books.  In &quot;Logan's Run&quot;, it means  simply killing anyone who starts to get too old, who might start to have a  little perspective.  In both stories, the main character is a member of the  elite, with a personal, professional stake in maintaining order, who  suddenly begins to question the whole system, and ends up siding with his  &quot;enemies&quot;, the thoughtful people.  At any rate, this is really  quite a tremendous book, and I hope a lot of people read it.	2000-09-12

I  wanted to point out that in a lot of ways, a person of that age can get  more out of this book than someone of a more advanced age...  High school  is one of the times in life when conformity, and the perceived importance  of fitting in, can be at  their most intense, and their most frightening,  as social forces.  This book takes those ideas, those forces, and magnifies  them by a thousand times.  Think about how scary it would be if you  literally had no libraries.  And not only your town would have no  libraries, but the WHOLE WORLD had all its records re-written every few  years, so the adult version of the popular kids (&quot;The Party&quot; in  this book) could tell everyone what to think, who to hate, who to like...  I think this is a really terrific book to think over.  In a funny way, a  reader of that age might even want to compare it to Stephen King's  &quot;Carrie&quot; -- in Stephen King's book, a lot of the background to  the story is all about conformity, and how the good kids hate it, and some  of the bad kids seem to use it as a sort of funnel for hatred, to funnel  all that bad energy toward a few kids, to hurt them.  I think in this book,  Winston Smith could be seen as a parallel to Carrie (the character Carrie,  not the book), only, unlike Carrie, he ends up breaking down in the end.  This is not a fun, happy story, but I think a lot of kids would really  respect themselves a lot more if they make themselves actually think about  the story.	2000-09-12

Characteristically, some of his main themes include the tension between  rationalism and mysticism, which crops up repeatedly in his work, as in the  ending of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, or in &quot;The Fountains of  Paradise&quot;, to name just two examples.  He seems to have a real  love/hate relationship with this issue -- as far as I know, it may date  from his experiences, as a scientist,  of local religious beliefs in the  land he has called home for decades now, Sri Lanka...  At any rate, in this  book the &quot;Overlords&quot; are a mysterious, powerful, but ultimately  tragic group of beings which have vastly potent minds, but which cannot  undergo the spiritual metamorphosis which would take them into direct  communion with the sort of Godhead that directs their (and our) destiny.  I  liked Clarke's ideas about utopia, which is more or less what the Earth  becomes after a few generations under the guidance of the Overlords.  He  seems to have had a lot of fun playing with ideas about future art forms,  for example, among other things.  However, this utopian society is doomed,  because of an unforeseen, quantum leap in evolution, which turns out to be  an evolution of the communal spirit.  Clarke has a lot to say here about  what connects us to each other, as human beings.  Are we all linked with  some higher being at the level of spirit, in the manner that islands would  be revealed to be all linked, if one were to somehow drain the world's  oceans?  Or is striving toward a planned, ordered, social utopia, with  allowances made for developing all of every individual's gifts to the  fullest possible degree, the best way to relate to each other?  These are  the sort of questions that Clarke explores in this terrific novel, and he  does it in a highly entertaining fashion throughout.	2000-09-12

The author has a number of humane, intelligent things to say, and he says them well...  There are two main  conflicts in this book, as I see it.  First, the contrast between medieval,  chivalric ideals of war, (or at least the [not really correct] popular  stereotype of them), where everyone involved is constantly worrying about  &quot;honor&quot;, vs. the modern war, where one bomb, in this case, can  totally destroy the entire human race.  This conflict is exemplified, in my  view, by the hot-blooded, passionate, anachronistic  young Grand Fenwickian  Tully Bascomb, on the one hand, fighting against the ruthlessly efficient,  modern American General Snippett on the other.  Second, the conflict  between two highly intelligent old men, the wise and humane  Pierce Bascomb  on the one hand,  and the scientifically brilliant but morally myopic Dr.  Kokintz on the other.  There is a very interesting, and beautifully  written, debate between these two men in about chapter 17 or so, (maybe 16  or 18, I forget) it's worth reading over a few times.<br />Watch for the  little things in this book -- there is a debate over whether birds that  settle in the miniscule duchy of Grand Fenwick should be called by the name  they are known as there, or if they should be called whatever the larger  (if not, ultimately, more significant) world outside calls them.  This  argument seemed kind of dumb to me, but if you keep reading Mr. Wibberly  gives it a nice little twist, and you can see why he included it.<br />On a  personal note, I wish more books about this kind of thing had more positive  scientist characters.  A lot of folks come to science, and love it, because  it gives them a chance to experience wonder about the universe, and this  wonder has a lot of value as a bulwark against excessive militarism -- we  can unite in a sense of childlike wonder, as opposed to uniting against  some enemy...  It can be akin to having a love of &quot;peace through  music&quot;, for me at least.<br />Anyway, back to the book -- lest I forget  to say so, let me come right out right now and say that it's very funny.   If your sense of humor runs to &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, you'll  definitely get a big kick out of this book, as well as being provoked by  it.	2000-09-10
US	52797729	RD8DKDWQMNP12	0679444815	786105285	Timeline	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Take it for what it is	I basically enjoyed this book.  I tend to be a pretty big Michael Crichton  fan, and although I don't disagree with other reviewers who point out some  of the author's shortcomings in this book, well, heck, I was entertained,  and that's what I paid for.  The problem of whether they are actually in  our universe's past or just a very, very, very similar past in an alternate  universe is a real issue, but readers should be aware that in the author's  note at the end of the book, Crichton specifically disavows any pretense to  being scientifically &quot;on the ball&quot; in this book.  People are  probably offended that Michael Crichton, of all people, would have truck  with such shoddy science, but the fact is that this is primarily a work of  historical fiction, ultimately intended for the big screen.  Although  Crichton is one of our ablest practitioners of the art of science fiction  in many respects, the fact remains that he is at heart an entertainer, and  in this case he just threw together a quasi-scientific rationale that let  him send people to the 14th century.  Unlike, say, in &quot;the Andromeda  Strain&quot;, the science here is just a means to an end, not the end in  and of itself.<br />That said, although this is basically not a terribly  complex work, Crichton does try to bring a few historical issues to the  readers attention that many readers might not have contemplated.  Lady  Claire is a very strong female figure, using sex and all her wiles to  politic and intrigue her way through the dangerous courts of crazed  warlords, trying to hold onto her inheritance...  The architectural stuff  is pretty engrossing -- not a lot of historical fiction deals in such depth  with these matters...  There are a few cool little extra elements thrown in  -- the game of proto-tennis being played in the monastery; the  sketchy-but-interesting overview of some of the technological precursors to  gunpowder; the general view of knights not as  &quot;knights-in-shining-armor&quot;, but as incredibly dangerous,  frequently insane, always HEAVILY armed killers, constantly on edge and on  the prowl in an uncertain, deadly, lawless environment...<br />I think the  Plague should have been accorded a more prominent role -- although the  action in this book takes place 7 years after the worst years of the  plague, the fact is that it was still a major source of terror, having only  recently killed half of Europe, and it kept cropping up repeatedly  throughout the 14th century, and for long after.  It is hardly even  mentioned in this book, except in passing, and in a sort of twist at the  end...  Another thing -- the native american doctor and the young cop in  the early chapters of the book strike me as being left over from an early  draft of this story, one which was mostly set aside.  Mark my words -- if  (&quot;when&quot;, I should say), this is turned into a screenplay, the  director will somehow incorporate their lines, their roles, into the roles  of the real main characters, Marek, Kate and Chris.<br />All in all, it has  its flaws, but it's still entertaining, and realistically speaking, it will  be the only book a lot of people ever read that goes into this much detail  about that period of history.	2000-08-29

This book, and the whole series, are rightly considered to be classics of the genre in many ways.  The only things I would bring to a new  reader's attention, is that you might want to stop and mull over the  feelings you get from reading this book.<br />The Old Ones, in some ways, are  like the ultimate In-Group, the ultimate club.  Some of the things that  happen, when the Old Ones are around, e.g. the way they can stop time for  ordinary mortals while they talk among themselves, can be read as highly  realistic depictions of interactions between, say, the popuilar kids in  school, when someone of lower standing is in the room.  Watch out for stuff  like this.  The psychological experience of forming an in-group, of knowing  secrets that set you apart and above, is what Susan Cooper is setting in  stone here.  Considered as a spiritual experience, you should remember that  this has its drawbacks.  For example, if you look at the descriptive  adjectives applied to the defenders of the Light, the words  &quot;grim&quot;, &quot;cold&quot;, and &quot;high&quot; come up a lot, but  you almost never hear them described as &quot;kind&quot;, or  &quot;warm&quot;.  Also, they are locked in a highly abstract struggle --  how about the actual acts of daily compassion or kindness that someone  might perform?  These seem to get sort of lost, glossed over, because they  aren't as imposing or grand-sounding as ideas about the Light and Dark  clashing.  My feeling is that a lot of this stuff comes out of Susan  Cooper's own experiences in a very class-ridden society, and at Oxford  University.  The ideals in this book are not things that Thomas Jefferson  would have supported, to put it mildly.  I am being a little facetious  here, but I am serious at the same time.  <br />Susan Cooper set out to write  an exciting story, and an involving one, and she has certainly done that.   I like Susan Cooper a lot, I consider myself very fortunate to have been  invited into her home.  I love this book, and I know I will read it to my  children someday.  But for someone coming to it fresh, just try to be a  sophisticated reader, while reading this, and ask yourself if you might be  being asked to accept things that we might all be better off not accepting.   Try to ask yourself whether any of the &quot;magical&quot; ideas in here  might be a mythologized way of looking at very real, disturbing parts of  social interaction.  That's my advice, anyway.  Definitely worth reading,  but please remember what I was saying about whether these impressive Lords  of the Light could be, maybe, a little kinder.	2000-06-20

In certain ways, I literally have even used it as a sort of ruler, against which I can measure my own spiritual growth...  But remember one thing, O book buyer -- this is not  science fiction.  Whatever you may have heard, you have to realize that  this is a book about love, and about learning to value yourself for the  person you are deep down, even if that person has some outwardly appalling  qualities -- and about trying to love others, even when there is little  apparent reason to do so.  There are a few quasi-scientific elements to the  story, but that isn't really the point...<br />Read this for the fantastic  characters you will meet.  Meg is relatively normal in many ways -- she has  braces, and is sort of plain, and gets a lot of grief from all the jerks in  her school who like to make fun of people.  She has depth, but I will let  you discover that for yourself.  Charles Wallace, her brother, is one of  the most interesting characters in all of children's literature.  Think of  Linus from &quot;Peanuts&quot;, but even younger, and with a mysterious  rapport with angelic figures.  He is sort of a &quot;genius&quot; in many  ways, but is viewed by his fellow townsfolk as the village idiot, much like  &quot;the fool on the hill&quot; in the Beatles song who's mind's eye is  drawn by the wonder of the word spinning 'round, while all those around him  mock him for his lack of attention to more mundane concerns.<br />The Murry  family in general is really neat.  You will want to belong to it.  The  parents are both brilliant scientists, Meg and Charles Wallace are two of  the children, and then the twins have some good moments in Madeleine  L'Engle's later books. They live in a beautiful old house, and are the only  dreamers in their town, the only ones connected up to larger things...  In  some ways I was once disturbed by what I percieved to be a certain class  bias in this book,  i.e. the Murrys seem to have inherited their house, and  there are no signs of any financial worry.  However, if you have this  feeling as well, look to some of the sequels for L'Engle's efforts to  rectify this situation, especially &quot;A Swiftly Tilting  Planet&quot;.<br />The tesseract is a &quot;wrinkle in time&quot;, which is  similar for story purposes to Dorothy's tornado; Lucy, Edmund, Susan and  Peter's wardrobe; Milo's tollbooth; or any number of similar devices...  Bear in mind when this was written, when you get to the part about  Camazotz, the Conformist Capital of the Known Universe.  This book came out  first in the early 60s, and in many important ways can be seen as a  reaction to Eisenhower era suburbia, with its plastic cheerfulness.  A few  years later, I wonder if the market for this might have diminished.

The tale of Prince Madoc, who supposedly came over to  Alabama from Wales in the same year as the events described in T.S. Eliot's  &quot;Murder in the Cathedral&quot;, (1170 A.D.), has had its zealous  believers, as well as its detractors, since the days of Elizabeth I.  In  this book, Thom asks the science-fictional question of &quot;what if&quot;  a.) this legend were in fact true, and b.) how did the descendants of  Madocs colonists fare?  It is always thought-provoking, always interesting.   There is one very disturbing scene, which essentially details a rape.  I  would advise women and younger readers, and sensitive people in general, to  try to be prepared for this, and perhaps to gloss over it altogether.  It  does serve to illustrate the brutality of life in certain societies, but  was a bit excessive for me.  The author obviously felt it was necessary,  but I am not sure I totally agree.<br />Apart from that, there is a lot to be  said for this book.  The whole idea is, for some people, inherently  fascinating.  This novel covers a span of many centuries, in a way that  works well for me.  You see the medieval Welsh people at one point, then a  chapter or two later you see them as  increasingly illiterate people with  fewer and fewer remnants of their religion, language, memories of Europe,  etc.  It is heart-breaking, but at the same time you do feel for the  descendants of the original colonists, who must survive in a harsh world,  and who have little time for remembering amenities.  The battle scenes with  the Cherokee, Sioux, etc. are exciting, I should say, but this is not a  book about war as such.  It is a very thoughtful overview of an intriguing  idea, and I must say that there is a LOT of attention paid to the ways of  real native americans.  Rituals, customs, crafts, etc. are all gone into  with the eye of an anthropologist.  I read somewhere that Thom is related,  by blood or marriage, I don't remember, to at least one native american  tribe, and the sympathy engendered by this tie, tempered by a realism which  many writers on these peoples do not display, shines through on every  page.<br />Some other books I recommend on related topics include &quot;Hidden  Cities&quot; by Roger Kennedy; the children's book &quot;A Swiftly Tilting  Planet&quot;, by Madeleine L'Engle; &quot;Sacajawea&quot; by Anna Lee  Waldo; or especially &quot;Letters and Notes on the Manners, Customs, and  Conditions of the North American Indians : Written During Eight Years'  Travel Among Them, 1832-1839&quot; by George Catlin.  Or, if you go to  yahoo.com, google.com, hotbot.com, or whatever search engine you prefer,  try searching for &quot;madoc and mandan&quot;, using Boolean operators,  and you should find a few dozen websites dealing with this fascinating  legend.	2000-06-05
US	52797729	R31G7Z5AMALQE6	0812541642	819603580	Waiting	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Pretty good as a thriller, but such awful science...	The basic idea of this book is indisputably neato.  I found myself really looking forward to how the tale might unfold, once I got the basic idea of a race of not-quite-human-beings having existed alongside us for 35,000  years.  However, there really could have been a lot more research put into  this.  The science just didn't make sense to me, compared with, say, a  Michael Crichton novel.  It was very, VERY skimpy to say the least.  Anyone  with the slightest scientific background will probably feel kind of  insulted on that point.<br />That said, the book isn't without its redeeming  features.  There is a lot of tension built up, as we wonder which of the  hero's friends are human, and which...  aren't.   There are a few flaws...   I think the very last few pages were probably supposed to be an unexpected  &quot;twist&quot; ending, designed to give the reader that certain,  satisfying jolt, but for me it didn't exactly work.  I probably shouldn't  go into it here, really, so suffice it to say that it concerns the hero's  son.<br />Read this as a thriller, if you enjoy thrillers, especially  thrillers heavy on chase scenes and police work.  But the science really  isn't too well done, so please be prepared for that if you are in the  market for science fiction.	2000-06-05
US	52797729	R2Q0F8YJ58Q955	0843941529	738255466	Rough Beast	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Not Relaxing	A very disturbing, fast-paced thriller. The evil character Jerry Mars was quite twisted, and so fearless that he would introduce himself, not even making up an alias but using his real name, to his victims before killing them... The Boston background was pretty convincing. Either Gary Goshgarian lives here in Boston, or at least he did his homework. I wondered if this book was in any way inspired by the true story behind \\"A Civil Action\\", because they both take place in precisely the same region, with the same theme, etc. Being half of Italian descent myself, I was slightly taken aback at the portrayal of the Italian-American \\"goombahs\\" who gathered every weekend to sick their dogs on each other in an arena. Maybe that is an authentic subculture of the Italian-American experience, but I've lived around Boston for most of my life and I've never run into it.<br />But that is a pretty minor point. Primarily this book deals intelligently with some of the issues raised by biological warfare, and really makes you feel the pain and confusion of some of the characters. It is remarkable well-written, considering the genre. Gary Goshgarian must have some kind of serious background in professional writing, it doesn't seem as though this level of skill is likely to be a one-shot deal. Great stuff.	2000-05-15
US	52797729	RYWB7VAYAYA3G	0385333498	794708589	The Sirens of Titan: A Novel	Books	5	3	3	N	N	The Dark Side of Punctuality...	I agree with the reviewers who feel that this book should be ranked higher in the Vonnegut canon.  It has a lot to say, often having to do with Vonnegut's preoccupations with the nature of time, and class, but you can approach it in a number of ways, all with some benefit.<br />What I mean by the title of this review, is something Vonnegut does often here, which sometimes is reminiscent of his Billy Pilgrim character.  He explores the meaning of the word &quot;punctual&quot; in the sense of &quot;existing at a point&quot;, as a way of looking at points in time.  When someone speaks a truth, Rumfoord will appear, and ruefully observe that this person has indeed uttered a truth, but &quot;oh, what a punctual truth&quot;, this meaning that the truth spoken will rarely hold up under the perspective afforded by a long overview of time, or in Rumfoord's case, the perspective of actual eternity.<br />The savage dog Kazak is here, so if you are a fan of his from &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; or elsewhere, you will not be disappointed.  I am depressed about Vonnegut's rendering of Rumfoord, the quintessential upper-class guy, with a very well-depicted upper-class voice, as such a hero.  Speaking as an American, it seems to me that Malachi Constant should be more the hero here, as I suppose he is, but in a very tragicomic way.  I guess Rumfoord doesn't exactly end up smelling like roses at the end either, so, hey, who knows.  Beatrice is interesting too.  I felt sorry for her toward the end, but she seemed sort of happy in some ways...  All in all, this book does make you think, and it is characteristically peppered throughout with Vonnegut's random telling observations.	2000-05-14
US	52797729	R1FQBR3ZHKV6VS	0345391810	458212829	The Restaurant at the End of the Universe	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Yeah, Baby!	Great stuff.  There are tons of cool little things going on...  If you haven't read this one, look forward to learning about the Total Perspective Vortex, and why the one thing people should NEVER strive to have is a sense  of perspective.  Moreover, this book features a rock star who is spending a  year dead for tax purposes.  It's worth the money for that part  alone.<br />Also, Marvin is back, hapless as ever, which adds something to the  experience of this book, although to call it a positive addition goes  somewhat against the spirit of Marvin...  whatever.  It's still hysterical.   The central plot of this story,  to the extent that there is one, is  Zaphod Beeblebrox's desperate attempts to totally avoid any adult  responsibility, and to simply enjoy life.  Again and again, he is thrust  into circumstances that he himself set up, in sort of a previous  incarnation (not exactly, but if you read the story you will see what I  mean), and again and again his one goal is to flee his responsibilities and  try to party harder than any sentient being has ever partied before.  You  could not possibly ask for a more hilarious anti-hero.  I loved it.  And,  as usual, along the way Douglas Adams makes you think about a whole range  of issues, from meat-eating, to the economic perils of putting all your  eggs in one basket, to the inanity of making documentaries on disasters  when the disaster is happening all around you.  Seven thumbs up.	2000-05-11
US	52797729	R103S66R8YT4SK	0345391837	458212829	So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Good, but very different from the rest of the series	My theory is that Douglas Adams had 2 worries after the first part of this whole series.  First of all, jeez louise, he sure was giving poor Arthur Dent a hard time...  couldn't he at least maybe let him have a girlfriend?   And second of all, how about the dolphins?  Douglas Adams is really into  animal rights, the environment, etc, and it just seemed a little  perfunctory to have them all totally obliterated along with the Earth just  because of that whole business about the interstellar hyperspace bypass.   In this book, dolphins, Arthur, and Arthur's (surprise) girlfriend somehow  come together, with a variety of mutant plot twists along the way.<br />As  usual with these books, I envy anyone coming to them for the first time.   Watch for the &quot;Rain God&quot;, he is quite hilarious, and sort of a  stand-in for Marvin in some ways.  Ford Prefect has sort of a guest  appearance, he isn't exactly central to the plot, but he becomes important  in some ways at the very end.<br />I would tell a new Douglas Adams fan to  read this as a love story, Adams' gift to the hapless Arthur Dent.  The  wackiness is MUCH lass omnipresent here than it is in the other books, so  be warned.  Basically good stuff, but very distinct in tone from the rest  of the series.	2000-05-11
US	52797729	R30CBOTAFTIMPP	0345418778	441859006	Mostly Harmless (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)	Books	4	5	8	N	N	Always philosophical, but rarely upbeat.  Beware...	People seem to have mixed opinions about the character &quot;Random&quot;, Arthur and Trillian's (biological) daughter.  Her presence in the story  constitutes more of a Statement than a character as such, I think.  She is  Douglas Adams' way of saying &quot;hey, we all feel lost, alone, helpless,  overwhelmed, uncertain where we belong, etc etc etc&quot;  Even so, she  probably could have been a little more fleshed out...<br />The &quot;Guide  Mark 2&quot; is really pretty creepy.  It makes you think about some of the  big questions, unsurprisingly, if you have read any of Douglas Adams' other  stuff...  Also, although the plot just goes hogwild for 95% of the book, it  really does all pull together at the end.  The book is relatively  self-contained, compared to some of the others in the series.  In general  this book is less wacky, and generally a bit darker, than the other books  in the &quot;trilogy&quot;.  Reading this is a little like going to  &quot;The Cable Guy&quot;, when you are expecting a usual Jim Carey movie.  It does make you laugh, but also makes you think, and not always in very  comforting ways.	2000-05-11
US	52797729	R25UDCC6ULUQ28	0345391829	458212829	Life, the Universe and Everything (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Watch for the Anti-War subtext	Another winner from Douglas Adams.  Arthur Dent, I increasingly believe, can perhaps best be compared to Bilbo Baggins, the Hobbit, from J.R.R. Tolkien's classic books.  He is a basically very humdrum guy, who gets  pulled into this kaleidoscopic world of adventure through no wish of his  own...  In this book, at any rate, the references to the game cricket went  mostly over, or perhaps under, my American head, but most of this book has  to do with the insanity of war, which of course is a pretty universal  message.<br />The White Robots of Krikkit sound a lot like the stormtroopers  from Star Wars, but it's probably better to compare then directly with the  Nazis from which those stormtroopers themselves were in all likelihood  derived.  The theme is of how most people from the planet Krikkit want to  enjoy life, listen to music, have their own little farm to raise a family  on, etc, while the warlords that run their government are constantly trying  to get them fanatically worked up to go forth and conquer the universe.   Trillian gets some of her first real character development in the whole  series, or at least a few solid lines, when she is the one to piece this  simple fact together, along with some other, less simple facts.  Again, a  very cool book, and one which makes you think in a good way about some  really important stuff.	2000-05-11
US	52797729	R3EDTOWCCQBB50	0691001588	496861247	The Light at the Edge of the Universe	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Folksy Cosmology	This book takes an unusual approach to this subject matter.  It is primarily a compilation of interviews with actual cosmologists, and it absolutely gives you a feel for the way this community feels from the  inside.  You hear the stories behind the unfolding of current cosmological  theory.<br />The closest thing I have to a complaint, and the only reason I  didn't give this 5 stars (I still may go back and just give it 5 stars  anyway, it is really superb), is the fact that there were really virtually  NO equations or diagrams.  I have heard that it is a truism in science  publishing that every equation an author incorporates into the text will  halve sales.  Perhaps that is why there is no math here.  I guess, even if  there were no math, a couple of more visual elements such as maps or charts  would have been nice.  There are photos of cosmologists, however, which is  interesting to see.<br />Basically a great book.  If you want pictures, that  Kip Thorne book about &quot;Black Holes and Time Warps&quot;, which I  believe is the title, can provide a fair number of relevant illustrations.	2000-05-10
US	52797729	R1H1HFOQEQQNHS	0451169530	825352881	The Stand: Expanded Edition: For the First Time Complete and Uncut (Signet)	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A Story that Sticks to your Ribs	Epic, complex, full of superbly-drawn characters...  This novel features all the hallmarks of King's writing that we have come to expect, and then some.  I almost wish I could start an argument in my high school English class about whether Harold Lauder was a tragic figure or just a villain.   Several of the characters are like this -- they stick to your ribs.  After  you put the book down, these people stay with you for quite awhile.<br />The  science is very cool, as well.  You can't stop wondering if it might ever  really happen -- some Ebola-like plague that the army cooked up  deliberately just somehow escaping, and wreaking uber-havoc on  mankind.<br />People have mixed views about the religious, eschatological  components to this story.  The fact that some people get so worked up about  is actually a sort of praise -- it is easy to forget that this is just a  story.  It feels so real.  If you look through people's reviews, some folks  seem to feel like Stephen King was just writing down his personal vision of  what the end of the world might be like, and people feel obliged to take  sides against him.  To these people, I would say -- guys, it's just a  story.  A powerful one, I had that reaction myself, bigtime, but still.   Come on.  Lighten up.<br />That said, it definitely does get you thinking.  I  liked Hemingford Home a lot, and found myself wishing I could go there to  meet Mother Abigail.  Basically there are a lot of really powerful themes  going on here, and cool characters, and I recommend picking it up -- you  won't regret it, and you won't forget this book.	2000-05-09
US	52797729	RGTQKX3NQHAN6	0345380118	796710884	Departures	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Very Good, but caveat emptor	These are really cool stories, don't get me wrong.  But at the same time, please don't expect strict &quot;alternate history&quot;.  Some of these are fantasy stories, for one thing, featuring werewolves, vampires, etc.  Also, I am not sure how any story that takes place entirely in the future  can be considered &quot;alternate history&quot;, although I suppose that  the stories set in the future do tend to feature at least a window into the  present or past, and it is cast in an unusual, &quot;alternate&quot; light.   Also, several of these tales deal with relatively obscure periods of the  history of the Greek speaking world, an area in which Mr. Turtledove holds  a PhD.  It got me so interested in that period that I ended up going to the  library to learn more about it, but just be prepared for the fact that  these stories don't all deal with well-known themes of this genre.   Definitely thought-provoking, and well-written tales.	2000-05-09

Not many books are like that -- friends who have read this have all plowed through it at least 5 times.  I myself discovered it in the early 80s, and have definitely read it dozens of times by now, no lie.   There's just something about it.  You can't stop, can't get away --  aaaaaahhh! <br />Seriously, this straddles the line between  &quot;funny-odd&quot; and &quot;funny ha ha&quot; more successfully, and  more hilariously, than any book I can think of.  One thing I should tell a  person coming to this for the first time -- Zaphod Beeblebrox actually does  start to make sense, during the sequels.  Well, not &quot;SENSE&quot;,  exactly, but his self-sabotaged brain becomes the key to a lot of cool  hijinks.  The second half of this book, after Arthur and Ford are picked up  by the Improbability Drive, appears TOTALLY random, but actually does make  sense in the context of the later books in the series.  You should remember  that this was originally a radio series, and this book is just the first  few installments of it.  The cutoff point is sort of arbitrary.<br />As the  series continues, Douglas Adams makes some really good philosophical points  about getting along with each other.  We should thank this guy, I think.   The more I think about it, the more I realize what a solid, good person  Douglas Adams is, to be able to laugh at the insanity that governs our  modern lives.  To even be able to SEE that it's insane is good, and to get  others to laugh out loud at it all is GREAT.  What a guy.  Cheers to  Douglas Adams, I say.  Read his books, you'll be glad you did.	2000-04-03

I just have to say this -- as hilarious as these books are, I think Douglas Adams is basically a very  serious man with important things to say.  In his later books, my guess is  that he was a little bothered by the way everyone just raves about how  funny his stuff is, without talking about the troublesome nature of the  very real issues he raises.  This stuff is absurd, and is deadly serious,  at the same time.  You should try to be aware of that, and of the tightrope  Douglas Adams was walking here.<br />Also, I personally know one woman who  chose to make her life's work one of helping animals, and actually became a  veterinarian (which required YEARS, YEARS, YYYEEEAAARRRSSS of poverty and  going to school to become one) because of Douglas Adams' book &quot;Last  Chance to See&quot;, which is about endangered species.<br />I think Douglas  Adams is a good and great man, a really warm philosopher, and it seriously  wouldn't surprise me if he was remembered and talked about in pubs long  after, say, Bertrand Russell or Alfred North Whitehead are just footnotes  in dusty thesises in library archives.	2000-04-03
