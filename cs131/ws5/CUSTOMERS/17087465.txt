Wilson takes on Michael Jackson and the fading stars of the Vegas strip to show the disastrous consequences of an unbridled need for public attention and adulation.  She compares the rock music of earlier generations to the fly-by-night pop stars of the last 20 years to illustrate how corporate marketing of the arts has drained them of their soul and genuine sexual potency in favor of product endorsement and marketability, however short-lived and disingenuous. <br /> <br />This obssession with appearances-over-content is most evident in Hollywood's current fervor for plastic surgery, now so ubiquitous it's hard to find examples of real bodies undergoing the real aging process.  Naturally this affects women more than men as large-breasted supermodels are juxtaposed with petite, ever-virginal female athletic competitors and the spectre of the female form on display in beauty pageants. <br /> <br />However, this is not a feminist diatribe against objectification nor an intellectual's disgust with the banality of America's pop culture tastes (though Wilson is indisputably both a feminist and an intellectual).  Wilson's voice serves as something of a moral prophet, condemning both the twisted values of the privileged and of their worshipful consumers.  Narcissism and self-loathing (a combination Wilson epitomizes with the likes of Bruce Willis, Barbra Streisand, and Woody Allen) are the hubris of a culture in which one gets fame by being famous (i.e. marketable) rather than by having done anything noteworthy. <br /> <br />Wilson concludes by showing the negative influence of fame on the arts themselves.  Since money now instills value and fame has become its own reason for existence, the traditional cathartic purposes of art have been lost almost completely.  People seek simplyto be entertained rather than to exorcise the truth of the human experience in the relative safety of artistic pursuits.  The tragic result is what Wilson astutely calls an audience \\"now so empty and well trained and schlock-addicted that it is indeed moved by these fatty theatrical dry humps and keeps coming back\\".	2005-06-02
US	17087465	R1SBJPDDJSC3HH	0679723161	636015448	Lolita	Books	5	11	14	N	N	Fascinating exploration of power, love, and self-deception	Writing from prison where he is held on trial for murder, Humbert Humbert recounts his obssessive passion for 12-year-old Lolita.  Fleeing a bad marriage from France to America, Humbert rents a room from Charlotte Haze where he becomes obssessed with Charlotte's daughter, Dolores (aka, Lolita).  While Lolita is away at summer camp, Humbert marries Charlotte.  When Charlotte discovers Humbert's diaries and their lacivious fantasies about her daughter, she is enraged and runs out into the street where she is struck by a car and killed. <br /> <br />Humbert fetches Lolita from camp, takes her to a hotel where they begin their sexual relationship before he has even told Lolita her mother is dead.  He then takes Lolita on a year-long journey across the US in an effort to avoid the discovery of their relationship and any intervention by the authorities on Lolita's behalf. <br /> <br />At the end of the year, Humbert settles down with Lolita in the town of Beardsley where he sends her to an upscale private school for debutantes.  Humbert and Lolita battle fiercely over her allowance and her behavior with boys, culminating in Lolita's insistance that they go back on the road. <br /> <br />Humbert complies and quickly figures out that he and Lolita are being followed.  Lolita's suspicious behavior suggests to Humbert that she is complicit in this and her sudden disappearance leads Humbert on a chase to find Lolita and exact revenge on her new lover. <br /> <br />As a novel, Lolita is intriguing on many different levels.  The book is so disturbing because Humbert is so decidedly NOT crazy.  It's certainly true that age of concent is cultural and that some children (what Humbert calls \\"nymphets\\") do radiate a certain <br />unconscious charm and sexuality. <br /> <br />But don't get stuck in the trap of thinking of this book as about sex or as an apology for child molestation. The real source of Humbert's madness is his narcissism, his obssession with carving Lolita up into body parts in his mind, with the transitory <br />nature of innocence. <br /> <br />It's a fascinating study of a manipulative abuser who truly believes he loves his victim. Particularly how Nabokov emphasizes Lolita's power in the situation because the abuser needs the abused (possibly for self-definition? Does Humbert even know who he is if he doesn't have a nymphet/victim that he can control <br />by allowing his obssession with them to, in fact, control him?) <br /> <br />Lolita should never be considered pornography. First because that allows the role of sex to take too much emphasis over other aspects of Humbert's relationship with Lolita and his own wounded psyche. Notice Humbert NEVER describes the sex act in the book. We know a few places where it happens but it's entirely left for us to infer. Porn is never that subtle, not even soft core. This book isn't a masturbation aid; it's the mind of a man so obssessed with the girl he loves that he has made that girl a figment of his own imagination. <br /> <br />Second, the novel doesn't serve the same purpose as pornography. Not just because the book isn't a masturbation aid, but because pornography relies on deceiving its consumer, giving a false impression and false \\"high\\" in place of the real experience. Usually with sex -- naughty, dirty scenes that stimulate arousal without any of the real-life messiness of sex (no worries about impotence or being able to orgasm or accidentally being squashed or having your hair pulled by your partner), all the things that make real sex so much fuller and more real than porn images of sex. <br /> <br />Whether Lolita \\"led him on\\" depends on how reliable you think Humbert is as a narrator. It struck me that Humbert was scrupulously honest, but deluded by his own narcissism. Which means his facts about Lolita would be meticulously correct, but his interpretation of them would not be. <br /> <br />We have to assume that Lolita was neither innocent nor virginal. Humbert wasn't herfirst partner and he wasn't even her first adult male partner. Spontaneously and passionately French kissing an adult isn't the usual way teenage girls exhibit their crushes on grown men. Lolita definitely knew how to seduce and how to manipulate (e.g. Humbert denies raping her at first, but by the end of the book believes that he did rape her forcibly as she <br />claimed; we're never told for sure what the truth is, but Humbert's compulsive personality seems to suggest he isn't hiding any facts, so I concluded from this that Humbert is so obssessed with Lolita that he eventually accepts her accusation as the truth). Knowing to manipulate by accusing a man of rape is not <br />indicative of a demure and innocent child. This kid not only knows how to play a grown woman's game, she knows how to play a scarlet harlot's game! At age 12! <br /> <br />And this is where it gets sticky and challenges all our ideas about victimhood. Because Lolita is undoubtedly Humbert's victim. The real Lolita (whoever she is) doesn't exist for Humbert. He <br />sees in her only what he wants to see - the object of his passion and obssession. We assume too easily that victimhood is an either/or proposition -- either one is pure, blameless, and deserving of unqualified sympathy OR one is complicit, guilty, and cannot be considered a victim. Real life is messier than that.  And Lolita challenges it. Because she's by no means an innocent little girl, but she is ALSO a victim. The two aren't mutually exclusive. <br /> <br />But I don't see how we can doubt Humbert loves Lolita.  This is a guy who can ramble for three pages about the downy hair on his beloved's arm. He's passionately in love with her -- the problem is, he never really SEES her, despite his meticulous recall of every inch of her body. The trouble with a narcissist is that they can't see anything except through the filter of themselves and in relation to themselves. <br /> <br />I suppose it's possible to argue then that a narcissist isn't capable of real love. But I think that would be a dismissive by-product of our therapeutic culture that likes to box every human experience into neat, diagnosable packages. Mostly for our own comfort -- if THEY are crazy, it means *I* am not. And it's not that simple. Granted, we aren't all capable of child molestation nor as extreme as Humbert, but we're all capable of being so enamored with something that we can't see it for what it really is. Humbert's narcisstic blindness is tragic for both him and for Lolita. <br /> <br />Lolita has been criticized as not only too salacious for the masses, but as an anti-American screed -- Humbert symbolizing Europe and Lolita symbolizing America and the overall story symbolizing Europe victimizing and screwing (literally) America. <br /> <br />Nabokov vehemently denied that he had any anti-American intent in writing Lolita. In fact, he said it pained him to be accused of anti-American sentiment and that he purposely set the novel in the US because the beauty of American landscapes made a good backdrop for Humbert and Lolita's affair.  Obviously, he pokes fun of some of the commercial, consumerist, and low-brow aspects of American culture.  But only Americans who confuse defensiveness for patriotism would really consider this anti-American. <br /> <br />This novel shouldn't be summed up as \\"a love story\\" anymore than it should be summed up as \\"a sex story\\". It's both, but it's so much more challenging than either.  It's a moving and fascinating exploration power, love, and self-deception.	2005-05-15

As Coss finishes her final aria, the building is overtaken by a band of revolutionary terrorists. <br /> <br />In the ensuing four months in which they are held hostage, the prisoners form relationships with the terrorists (two of whom they are surprised to discover are young girls).  These relationships and the beauty of Coss' singing begin to make hostage and terrorist alike feel glad for the time they are trapped together. <br /> <br />Coss develops a love affair with the head of a Japanese electronics company; a translator falls in love with a terrorist.  Hostage and terrorist begin to learn from each other and play with one another. <br /> <br />The terrorists begin to learn that they are more than who they believed themselves to be.  They learn new languages.  They learn to cook and to sing, to play games and to garden.   <br /> <br />Eventually, the lines between hostage and terrorist blur entirely until no one wants this time together to end and they fear the outside world more than they fear one another. <br /> <br />This is a novel primarily about communication and its progression from broad and ineffective attempts to communicate to the specific, intimate, and successful.  On the basest level, the terrorists take the party-goers hostage in a doomed attempt to communicate with their government.  As time goes on, they move through the use of translators to learning one another's languages to eventually knowing and understanding one another.  Ironically, this leads the novel's large host of characters to live and love more fully than they ever did before becoming trapped inside the mansion. <br /> <br />The novel itself reads like an opera -- haunting, lyrical prose that builds to what will surely be a bittersweet and tragic fate.    On the down side this lyrical writing gets a bit dull, dragging out details about the lives of characters that lack immediate context.  Point of view changes sometimes from one paragraph to the next until we're trying to see such a broad picture through so many lenses that it becomes difficult to sit still long enough for any picture at all. <br /> <br />While Patchett certainly humanizes every character in the novel (despite their station), this isn't done in any realistic way.  Granted, this novel was never meant to be realism, but it does risk giving the impression that either (1) all revolutionaries in the tradition of Che Guevara are violent terrorists or (2) revolutionaries are merely mixed-up children who can be loved out of their pesky political persuasions.  We never understand how these children came to be terrorists nor to what degree they believe in what they are doing or why they are doing it.	2005-04-16

Books	5	3	3	N	N	A frank and funny humanitarian	In 1967, Kathleen Kinkade's life changed when she read  BF SKinner's utopian novel, Walden Two.  Inspired by this vision of  <br />community, Kinkade founded Twin Oaks Community in rural Virginia (an  income-sharing intentional community still in existence today). <br /> <br />In this first account of the early history of Twin Oaks, Kinkade outlines the community's earliest struggles for everything from  <br />enough money for survival to learning how to erect buildings with  <br />virtually no material or skill.  She tells the stories of Twin Oaks' earliest members and how they contributed to this communal experiment.  Throughout  these struggles, Kinkade maintains both her wry sense of humor and her humanistic vision. <br /> <br />Kinkade's book remains as fresh and funny as it was in 1972.  I highly recommend it as an introduction both to the intentional communities movement as well as for those with dreams of pioneering their own community someday.	2005-03-07

When she witnesses the televised assassination of Lee Harvey Oswald, she suddenly remembers that she was once \\"Christine of Oradour\\" -- the sole known survivor of the Nazi decimation of a small French village.  Christine returns to France to uncover her buried memories of the horror of the Holocaust. <br /> <br />In many ways, Lucas' novel is a beautiful tale of the resiliency of the human psyche and the redemptive power of faith.  However, the novel suffers some credibility problems.  For example, when Christine arrives in the US, she's at the mercy of a culture she doesn't fully understand.  This is hard to believe given Christine's career.  Lucas makes much of Christine's inability to understand American slang, but then proceeds to put American idioms into the character's mouth. <br /> <br />At times, the horror of the Nazis is portrayed in such lovely prose that it becomes almost gothically, dreamily beautiful.  It becomes too easy for the reader's mind to skim the surface.	2005-03-07

The autistic-like symptoms of their son, Esau, has brought Claire and Arnold's Schiller's marriage to the breaking point and Arnold kills himself with a single bullet to the head. In the aftermath, Claire, Esau, and the youngest Schiller child, Kate, must come to terms with Arnold's suicide and learn how to piece their lives back together. Claire's best friend, Donna, is also struggling with her husband's post-Vietnam, Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome and its resulting depression and alcoholism. Donna's son, Davey, helps Kate to cope with the death of her father while Donna provides Claire support.   When Donna's husband also comes to a mental breaking point, the two families must learn to re-define what being a normal, small-town family is really all about.  <br /> <br />Every once in awhile, I find a book that combines beautiful prose with a story I can't put down. The Center of Winter is one of them! This anatomy of a family torn apart by mental illness is so filled with the flavor of Northern Minnesota, I can almost taste it! The seasons of the region are cleverly used by the author as a metaphor for human emotion, the cycle of life and death, and the endless cycles of grief and acceptance. Hornbacher has captured the essence of the major turning points in life in which time both speeds up and slows down, when denial blends with the beginning of deeper awareness. The story is also the anatomy of a suicide and the author has made it impossible not to watch this unfold using a perfect mix of horror and compassion. The changes in narrative voice are a bit jarring, but Hornbacher couldn't have told this story any other way. The tale is more emotional for having avoided the exaggeration of the children's emotional responses. She avoided the risk of hypersentimentality by creating entirely believable characters who behave in entire believable ways. I cried reading this book and I almost never cry at novels.	2005-02-08

Was this author even trying? She doesn't seem to understand that just making chick lit \\"go ethnic\\" doesn't automatically make it any less vapid and pointless. The Mexican family is a cheap cliche, the book is about nothing, the dull plotline is interrupted for a few soft-core porn scenes, and the writing is unequivocally bad from the opening scene discussing Tamara's menstrual period through a character being described as walking \\"into her office like something had flown up his butt\\". I've seen better prose from 6th graders. Castillo reveals the kind of underachiving readership she seeks when she starts citing Nora Roberts novels. The only advantage to the book's migraine-inducing pink cover is that it might deter people from wasting their money on this frivolous trash.	2005-02-01

He sends his older daughter, Tess, to live with the D'Urbervilles, unaware that the current family of D'Urbervilles are imposters.<br /><br />At the home of these imposters, Tess is raped by the eldest D'Urberville son, Alec. She flees and gives birth to a child conceived by the rape. The infant dies and Tess buries him in secret.<br /><br />In an attempt to escape her past and start anew, Tess takes a milkmaid job at Talbothay's Dairy where she meets and falls in love with Angel Clare. Angel is a beautiful man who loves Tess deeply, but when he proposes to her, she is torn between lying to him by omission versus telling him of her past with Alec -- a choice that would likely alienate him in the strict morals of Victorian Britain.<br /><br />After they are married, Tess breaks down and tells Angel of her shameful past. Angel can't cope with it and leaves Tess penniless to travel to Brazil. When both Angel and Alec return to her, she is faced with the choice between them and the disastrous consequences of her decisions.<br /><br />Overall, I was disappointed by the lack of theme. The story is just unrelenting bleak, which wouldn't have bothered me except there didn't really seem to be a point to it. A lot of the text is spent repeating things that really didn't need to be repeated, especially in the entire section devoted to the lead-up to Tess agreeing to marry Angel. We knew it was going to happen, so I quickly lost interest in all tension-building that didn't really build any tension.<br /><br />I guess it might have been about the tragic fate of principled people. Tess is a moral woman, she desires only to be happy -- and both lead her to nothing but tragedy. I realize this was a bit cutting edge in the late 19th century when people wanted their stories to have happy endings no matter what happened in the middle. But explorations on the unfairness of life are only realistic if they rest on the capriciousness of fate. Murphy's Law just doesn't kick the hell out of people like it does to Tess.<br /><br />There is the class confusion element; the \\"what constitutes a true gentleman?\\"; the critique of basing the aristocratic label on either blood or money. But, really, I'm getting burned out on the theme that poor people are just inherently better than everyone else. It's not realistic so it doesn't do much for the development of a class conscience.<br /><br />There isn't even any feminist theme. Men dominate Tess her entire life, but this isn't the factor that leads to any of Tess' problems. Her problems are shown to be entirely the work of cruel fate (who apparently has it in for her to an extreme degree).<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I did enjoy the book. This is just what really prevented me from really loving it. I did enjoy the story and the writing itself. I just think there are better classics out there.	2005-01-30

Despite the fact that Ryken seems more theologically conservative than I find tasteful, this book does a good job of making the Bible accessible to the average reader as a matter more of Western culture than Christian faith.  The author's emphasis on literature underscores that the importance of the Bible lies in its ability to communicate by evoking an emotional experience in the reader.   <br /> <br />However, as a product of Western literature, there are a few important points Ryken skips over:  How can the Biblical stories clearly intended in the Bible as morality tales not become trite and manipulative to postmodern Western audiences?  Does the use of metaphor in the Bible invite differing interpretations because each reader will have a different experience of the original metaphor?  And perhaps, due to Ryken's Wheaton-based theology, he entirely fails to address overiding themes in the Bible such as the condemnation of hubris and exclusivity.	2005-01-29

It's truly disgusting.  It cynically exploits two groups in America that are known for their willingness to plunk down phenomenal amounts of cash in pursuit of their dreams -- brides-to-be and women who think they're too fat and get caught up in the weight loss craze. <br /> <br />Kleinberg's \\"program\\" is nothing more than an unholy union of militaristic language juxtaposed with the flowery, sentimental dreaming that supposedly infuses the engagement days of any girl-bride. The program relies heavily on guilting women about the size and shape of their bodies, particularly in relationship to male bodies, exhorting women to go ahead and eat cookies if they wish, but only if they first strip down and eat it naked in front of the mirror (apparently to shame themselves out of the desire for tasty food).  <br /> <br />Kleinberg uses the same shaming technique by encouraging women to compare their female bodies to that of their husbands-to-be in a method that is nothing short of absolutely evil, throughout the book encouraging women to \\"Be his better half, not his better three-quarters\\". <br /> <br />There's no reason to believe the program itself would not be effective since there's absolutely nothing original about it except for its cynical target marketing. Indeed, her program consists of exactly what doctors have been telling Americans for years -- that good nutrition and exercise are the keys to weight loss and physical health. Kleinberg has simply regurgitated this basic medical advice using a woman's supposed fixation on her wedding day as the culmination of her otherwise pitiful existence, as if we have little other motivation for good health than to look waifishly dainty in a party dress.  <br /> <br />This is the worst book I have had the misfortune to pick up (perhaps ever) and any self-respecting woman will avoid it like the plague. Take the medical advice, but give Kleinberg and her fascist, self-hating sexism two middle fingers way, way up.	2005-01-27

The short story offered, Cathedral by Raymond Carver, seemed to me a weak and amateurish example to hold up, but the advice is very sound and practical.  Teachers of the Gotham Writers' Workshop trade off in each chapter, expounding by turns on their areas of expertise.  They address common problems for beginning writers and offer practical help for resolving those problems.  I found the chapter on Theme particularly useful (it is provided by Terry Bain).  The book concludes with a useful cheat sheet to help focus the novice writer's work.  My only experience with the Gotham Writers' Workshop was overpriced and offered little to no practical help or feedback on my writing examples.  So I can't recommend them based on my experience -- just get the book and work on your own is my advice.	2005-01-26

She covers the early caliphate leaders of the 7th century and the first fitnah, which led to civil war in the Arab world. She discusses the role of the Umayyads in the second fitnah and the religious division between the Sunnis, the Shiites, and the Sufis. The author uses the Abbasid period of the 8th and 9th centuries to show how the Muslim community used their faith to adapt to numerous political changes that ultimately crumbled the caliphate and ushered in the Sunni Iranian dynasty. The 14th century Crusades led to the Muslim subjugation to the Mongols, but prepared Muslims for the imperial Islam of the Ottoman Empire. Armstrong concludes by introducing the modern democracies of the Western world and their influence on Islam. She discusses the modern Islamic state and how Islamic perceptions of democracy differ from Western notions. The author also provides a clear definition of Muslim fundamentalism.	2005-01-25

The glitz of New York in the 1920's barely overlays its moral decay.  Our ambiguous narrator, Nick, is repulsed by this at the same time as he is complicit in every event of the story.  The distant and pining figure of Jay Gatsby, who longs for a woman he can never have, represents the belief that money can buy anything and the purposelessness that would occur if a dream were fully realized.  As a near-perfect example of modern literature, Gatsby uses symbolism itself to show that symbols only hold the meanings with which we vest them.  For example, the symbol of the eyes is so haunting because it infuses the story, but has no fixed meaning or context.  As long as this novel remains a beloved classic, America will never fully be able to divorce itself from its past.	2005-01-25

And magic is long gone from England. The only society of magicians in York is purely theoretical and never so much as contemplated performing any magic. Then the society stumbles upon the fussy, bookish, reclusive Gilbert Norrell, who proves to them he is the only practicing magician left in England when he causes all the statues in the York Cathedral to burst into song. <br /> <br />Propelled to fame by what Norrell considers rather modest magic, he is soon called upon to aid the British government against the French and to resurrect the deceased bride of a cabinet minister -- an act which prompts the appearance of a strange gentleman from the land of Faery who begins laying a plot for the downfall of English magic. <br /> <br />Norrell is soon displaced from his position of notoriety by the arrival of Jonathan Strange, a young and eager upstart with a gift for practical magic. Strange and his young wife, Arabella, are beautiful, intelligent, and quickly popular in York society. Norrell takes Strange on as a pupil, hoping to control Strange's access to magical knowledge. <br /> <br />However, the day comes when young Mr. Strange is ready to branch out as an independent magician, leading to a rivalry between Strange and Norrell that increases along with the threat from the land of Faery. Finally, when tragedy befalls Jonathan, he and Mr. Norrell must learn to set aside their differences and work together to save Britain.  <br /> <br />This book was a real first for me.  It's the first time I've seen a novel with such lovely prose and delightful wit that was this badly in need of an editor!  I could appreciate the idea of a satirical history of Britain, but an otherwise fun tale is bogged down in footnotes that go on for pages and a tedious amount of unnecessary detail.	2005-01-22

Frank Baum's world of Oz from the perspective of the Wicked Witch of the West. Elphaba is born with the dual disabilities of green skin and a severe allergy to water. The daughter of a preacher and a philandering hedonist, little Elphaba is an outcast in Munchkinland. When she leaves home to attend college in Gillikin, the north of Oz, she rooms with her future archnemesis, Glinda, a shallow and pampered socialite. Elphaba discovers in college both an affinity for the life sciences and a political passion for fighting the dictatorial Wizard of Oz, whose edicts have stripped sentient Animals of their basic rights. <br /> <br />When she leaves college, Elphaba becomes a freedom fighter amidst the corruption of the Emerald City. But when her first true love falls victim to a political assassination, she vanishes to western Oz, the land of Winkies, and, disillusioned and embittered, reinvents herself as the Witch of the West. Elphaba finds a sort of peace among the Winkies until the day a tornado lands a foreign little girl and her dog in Oz, accidentally killing Elphaba's sister. When Glinda foolishly send the little girl to the Emerald City, the child may inadvertently play into the oppressive power of the Wizard and Elphaba must take action against the foreigner and protect the land of Oz.  <br /> <br />This a fun, intriguing, and intelligent reimaging of the popular story, though at times, the writing is dense and leaves major plot points entirely to the imagination of the reader to figure out.  If you don't mind doing a little more work than ought to be expected of the reader, this book is really quite enjoyable.	2005-01-20

I had a hard time keeping the characters straight and, worse, it didn't really seem to matter anyway. And what was with all that coarseness? Does this guy think he's David Mamet? Sam Shepard? What?<br /><br />I think that coarseness was really what did the novel in for me. No one really seemed to care about anybody else. Not that I need (or even want) a whole lot of love and emotion dripping from any novel, but there was no connection between these characters at all that served to pique my interest. It was almost an insult to working class neighborhoods in the East. The portrayal seemed to be more of Lehane's rough-and-tough-guy fantasies than anything else.	2005-01-19

It contains the same sharp but subtle insights into American culture, in this case, the American tradition of becoming whatever it is you appear to be. Forced normality because whatever is truly normal and natural is never good enough. <br /> <br />The parallels to Greek mythology are well-placed -- Calliope is the oldest muse, of writing and epic poetry, now telling the epic story of his own family history. In mythology, Calliope had to settle an argument between Aphrodite and Persephone and did so by giving them both equal time. <br /> <br />Then the Minotaur was the half-man, half-beast creature born of the unwise mating of Pasiphae and the white bull. So Minos locks up the monster in the Labyrinth. Minos, who goes nuts when his son is murdered, starts wreaking havoc on Athens and demands that every 9 years 7 boys and 7 girls must be sacrified to the Minotaur locked up in the Labyrinth in exchange for peace. This continues until the hero, Theseus, gets wind of it. He takes pity on the families of the sacrified children and vows he will go in with them and bring them all out alive. He does this first by bringing in some girls dressed as boys and boys dressed as girls in order to confuse the Minotaur. Then Minos' daughter, Ariadne, gives him a ball of string to trace his way into and back out of the Labyrinth. Theseus goes into the center, kills the Minotaur, and emerges victorious. I've always loved this story. Partly because I think the Minotaur gets a bad rap and I've always wondered what happened inside the Labyrinth when Theseus kills him. That part of the story is never told. <br /> <br />One could write a whole separate book on the use of Greek mythology in Middlesex. There's Antigone, played by the Obscure Object, the first anarchist of the Greek stage who defies the state by burying her brother's body. For this, she is imprisoned in a cave. Teiresias, the part played by Callie in the book, warns the ruler of Thebes that the gods are on Antigone's side. <br /> <br />There probably *is* fodder here for a whole separate book analyzing Eugenide's use of this stuff. There's also the Oracle at Delphi and Androgeus, which I'm sure meant something, but I don't know much about their stories. He seems to have picked the running themes of fate, hubris, and being only half-something and half-something-else (which I guess about covers Greek mythology) <br /> <br />At first, I was a little bored by the whole story of Desdemona and Lefty and then Milton and Tessie. I knew what it was getting to (the inbreeding causing Cal's syndrome, blah, blah), but I was getting a little impatient at that point. It did make me wonder though: if we could wipe out all other manipulation such as media conditioning and so forth, how much of attraction could be based on genetics? Do our bodies communicate genetics in such a way that potentially our attractions could be based on one person's genes having compatibility with another person's genes and the mind perceiving this as sexy and attractive? <br /> <br />Once the Obscure Object came into the picture, I thought the book got much more interesting. I wonder if girls create such deep emotional bonds in early adolescence as a form of rebellion against the power they sense boys already have? Like without even knowing they're doing it, they're standing together. Or almost falling in love with each other because they know other girls will understand them in a way they suspect boys won't and that makes other girls safer.. <br /> <br />The whole gender exploration completely fascinated me. I mean, I knew there were more than two genders, but I'd never really thought about it like this. I've always had this theory that we're all bisexual, because gender is much more ambiguous than most societies allow. I mean, where's the line? We're obsessed with the genital determination of gender and sex, but it doesn't seem to be very helpful. <br /> <br />Then I got to wondering: is feminism too limited? Is the real problem beyond the oppression of women and really that we suppress multiple sexualities and gender identities and misogyny is only one piece, or one symptom, of this? Will feminism ultimately stagnate unless it embraces the GLBT movement for this reason?	2005-01-17

A Spy in the House of Love is one more piece in Nin's ongoing effort to explore the self-creation of women in response to social repression.  The plot is undoubtedly autobiographical, written as it was during a time when Nin was developing a relationship with a California man and trying to divide her time with her husband in New York. <br /> <br />The novel explores the tension between the desire to break taboos and the inevtable guilt that arises from bucking societal mores.  Sabina is a complex character who breaks the misogynist stereotypes of the nymphomaniacal woman and instead delves into the chains imposed on women by the linking of sexuality with love.  Nin's prose is like reading hot butterscotch (if that were possible). This is a beautifully sensual poem about the nature of freedom. Sabina longs for \\"a love not concerned with possession of her, but of a complete understanding that would include absolution\\". And, tragically, she cannot find it while she constantly shifts roles -- and lovers.  For Sabina, there is no absolution, only the integrity of the confession itself.	2005-01-16

On one level, it's a murder mystery. The town lech, Fyodor Karamazov, is murdered and all of his sons have one motive or another for wanting to murder him. His oldest, Dmitry, appears to be guilty. Fyodor owed Dmitry 3000 rubles (mysteriously missing after Fyodor is killed) and they were both in love with the same woman.<br /><br />But then on another level, the book is about the nature of faith and God. Each of the relationships is the relationship between ideas. It juxtaposes individualism with the affect of the social order on individuals.<br /><br />Does faith in itself make people virtuous? Or is faith a structure to prevent people from acting NOT virtuous? Which is more important -- love for all humanity? Or love for the individual? For the religious, morality depends on the immortality of the soul. But, is that then truly morality? Is it morally superior to do wrong and hate yourself for it? Or to not know you're doing wrong at all? Where is the line between suspicion (there's this whole theme in the book that dishonest people cannot love because they will always be suspicious) and skepticism? Is the concept of sin a doomed idea intent on controlling the baser parts of what it means to be human? In which case, the idea redemption is just a way of distancing ourselves from our own humanity. If God gave free will, then why do the religious attempt to take it away? They take away free will and offer security instead, which is like saying God failed and they need to jump in and take over.	2005-01-13

What's getting more tiresome is how few Americans are getting the point. <br /> <br />This book has some good information mixed in with a lot of cliched and not-particularly-funny jokes. He lost a lot of points from me for not providing footnotes. Much of his information is verifiable elsewhere, but I have no way to check his credibility when he doesn't cite his sources. I'm also getting tired of the \\"patriotic liberal\\". Not that I assume these guys don't have some affinity for their home country, but Hightower (like Michael Moore) seems to feel they can only sell their idea if they convince the reader they are MORE patriotic than their opponents. When I see the stuff they're talking about, I don't feel love for my country, I feel shame. They also seem intent on convincing me that the vast majority of Americans are certifiable geniuses. Whereas, when I watch the suburbanites flock in droves to Walmart, driving their SUV's while stopping off afterwards at McDonalds, I have to wonder how the average American is still walking upright. <br /> <br />I give Hightower credit for making the corporte scandals less confusing and more accessible, but I just found the book neither intellectual nor entertaining.	2005-01-11

I found the stories a mixed bag. My favorite was A Temporary Matter, probing a troubled couples' ability to be honest with one another and the value and destructive potential of total honesty. The title story, Interpreter of Maladies, talks about the responsibility of the interpreter (similar to that of the author) to accurately convey experiences to those who do not understand. Mrs. Sen's shows what comes of independence in trying to adjust to a new culture and The Third and Final Continent made me think of the points in life when you can look back and realize how truly full your life has been. Other than those, I unfortunately found the other stories overly bogged down in details until they became fairly forgettable.	2005-01-10

And it's nice to read a book that not only offers hope and solutions, but that goes beyond the 101 primers about globalization that are widely available. This book assumes you already know some of the issues and the problems that they create. <br /> <br />The downside to this is that it's unlikely to be a book read by the people who most need to read it. While the information is laid out clearly, it's not very readable; at times, it's even pretty dry. Personally, I would have found more examples helpful both in terms of illustrating the points and in giving a human face to the problems and their solutions. It's one thing to know how Monsanto is shutting down x-number of family farms; it would be another thing entirely to hear the story of a farmer who lost his livelihood due to a ridiculous Monsanto lawsuit. <br /> <br />So while it's nice to find something on the subject that's more challenging to read, I do wish it's something that the general public would be inclined to pick up and feel inspired by. The Forum has very, very important things to say about the future of work, the environment, and human life, but I'm afraid, given the format and style, that they're likely preaching to the converted.	2005-01-08

He shares the joys of boyhood with his best friend, Hassan, the son of the family servant who is more like a brother to Amir, and their favorite pasttime is summer kite fighting. But Hassan is a despised racial minority in Afghanistan and when Amir betrays Hassan to the neighborhood bully, his guilt sets the rest of his life on a new course, constantly seeking redemption for his own weakness. When the Soviets invade Russia, Amir and his father flee for the United States where Amir marries and begins a writing career. He is never fully able to forget his betrayal of Hassan and, when his father's business partner in Pakistan sends a deathbed summons for him, Amir returns to Kabul for a last chance to find absolution.  <br /> <br />In some ways, this is a lovely story of sin and redemption. Hosseini lays out at the beginning the idea that every sin is a form of theft and then uses the rest of the story to spin out the idea that redemption happens when goodness is born of guilt and that war or war-like situations demand a higher level of integrity and decency from people who often fail in that regard. He uses Amir and Hassan's stories and the larger story of Afghanistan (at least at first) to drive these themes. <br /> <br />Hosseini's prose is certainly nothing spectacular, but still impressive given that English isn't his first language. He has a vivid style that's able to make Afghan culture accessible to Americans (most of whom had never heard of Kabul or the Taliban before September 11 and most of whom still couldn't locate it on a map during the US bombing of Afghanistan). For that reason alone, Hosseini could be an important writer because he can hit the American best-seller list as an Afghan, publishing in English about Aghanistan. <br /> <br />But in some ways, it was a little TOO Americanized. Parts of it just **screamed** \\"movie contract\\" -- the flashbacks during Hassan's rape, the fight scene between Amir and Assef, the kites at the beginning and the end. And, while I'm willing to suspend disbelief for the sake of a good story, too much in this story strained credibility to the point of distraction and was overly predictable. Hassan was so angelic, he was unreal. Running into Assef again, who just happens to have Hassan's son, who just happens to give Amir a split lip that just happens to resemble Hassan's harelip? Please! And I could see the last 60 pages coming from a mile away. The second we find out Hassan had a son who is not orphaned, it was way too obvious the kid was going to go home with Amir (who conveniently couldn't have a baby of his own). I even knew when he mentioned the razor blades that Sohrab was going to attempt suicide. <br /> <br />Those last 60 pages were what really shot my whole opinion of the book. This overly-predictable, overly-melodramatic Not-Without-My-Daughter-meets-Beaches garbage. Hosseini had a real chance to tell the story of Afghan history, politics, and culture in the context of these vivid characters and he blew it. He presented the question during Amir's return to Afghanistan of why fascism appeals to insecure and unstable populations as a means of easing their fear, but then he failed to answer that question in any meaningful way and just abandoned it for an imminently action/adventure filmable Rescue of Sohrab from their childhood nemesis with a psuedo-heartwarming ending. <br /> <br />It went downhill from there as he abandoned his Afghan voice entirely and started using American phrasing that were inconsistent with the earlier narration -- \\"I felt like a prick\\", \\"What's up?\\", etc. And I thought his handling of September 11 was just irresponsible. He mentions the event itself, but then there's no mention at all of the fallout in Afghan communities in the US. Nothing about the people hiding in their homes because people who appeared Middle Eastern were harrassed, assaulted, or sometimes killed. No mention of the outrage American Afghans felt at the abrupt change in US policy towards Afghanistan or the subsequent war. Nothing. I have to wonder, cynically, if he purposely left this out because he knew how many of his American audience he would piss off if he appeared \\"un-American\\" and I just don't have much respect for that. <br /> <br />Overall, the book entertained me, but was ultimately a disappointment.	2005-01-08
US	17087465	R2MNTJ9PY9NKWY	081297106X	635066654	Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books	Books	5	7	9	N	N	An epiphany of truth	On the first page of the book, Nafisi describes the role of fiction as \\"not reality but the epiphany of truth\\", a theme she <br />continues to develop throughout the book. I realized reading this how subversive reading really is (and how much we squander that in the west by reading drivel!). It got me thinking a lot about \\"what is literature?\\" and what is simply drivel? At one point, Nafisi asks whether it's possible to write a reverent novel. Which got me thinking that perhaps what I would call \\"drivel\\" is \\"the reverent novel\\" -- that which never challenges me or my pre-conceived ideas or my culture or how I live my life. If a book is too reverent of me or my world, perhaps that's why I wind up feeling like it's not worth my time. <br /> <br />I picked up this book expecting it to be about her class and their thoughts on the specific novels (this is really more the publisher's fault than the author's since I got this idea from the blurb on the back). But I adjusted quickly to the fact that this was about one woman's experience of the Iranian revolution <br />and that she's using books as a vehicle to tell her story. There are so many purposes reading serves to Nafisi and her students -- they use it to rebel, to examine their lives, to escape from their lives. Really, all the same reasons I read, except their need for all of them was perhaps more urgent. <br /> <br />The book also got me thinking about faith -- both about the meaning of it and the way fundamentalism destroys it. I was struck by Mahshid's story. She was a pious girl who largely behaved the way the regime wanted women to behave even before the shah was chased out of Iran. So at first, I couldn't figure out what she was doing in Nafisi's underground class. I judged her right off the bat. Until she started talking about how the regime had rendered her faith meaningless by imposing it on everyone. Her choice to wear chador meant something under the shah; it was counter-cultural, rebellious. It was a wayfor her to express herself and the depth of her faith. Once all women were forced under the veil, Mahshid's actions didn't mean anything anymore. Because now it was dictated and no one could consciously choose it (the Christian Coalition could really afford to take a lesson from this!) It gave me a greater respect for fundamentalism (something I normally lack) because I realized that forcing fundamentalism shows a disrespect for it. So in that sense, my goals and theirs are similarly opposed to those who would force the values in hopes of enforcing the faith that those values are supposed to demonstrate by choice. <br /> <br />At one point, Nafisi writes off \\"the personal is political\\" as nonsense. Which I found ironic since her entire story seems to demonstrate this very idea. A non-fiction text on the dangers of totalitarianism couldn't have brought the points home any stronger than her personal story. For one thing, she focuses a great deal on the unkindness of it. Which would probably be overlooked in any kind of non-fiction treatment of the subject, but is also probably the most noticeable and hardest aspect to live with on a day-to-day basis -- people living under fascism simply aren't very nice to each other. The warped idea of <br />tolerance -- not that we will value you for your uniqueness, but only that we won't (or can't) actually harm you for it. The absurdities of it and the ways those absurdities become so normal they're taken for granted -- the blind censor approving things he couldn't even see, how pointless it became to fight the regime over something so small as strands of hair when the consequences for it were so ridiculously steep. Those things would have to gnaw on your soul after awhile. Especially if you couldn't bring yourself to ever stop seeing them. I think that was the idea of \\"poshlust\\" -- the equation of banality and brutality. The regime reduced these women to complete triviality, both an act of brutality against them and a means of continuing the large-scale brutality when they accepted it. Perhaps banality is the mixed blessing of no longer being able to see the insanity of what's happening right under your nose. <br /> <br />The most insidious thing about this \\"poshlust\\" is convincing its victims they WANT such banality to the point that they wouldn't even see it as imposed upon them, but as a free choice. Sort of like metaphorically raping their souls until they believe they're consenting. At one point, Nafisi calls this \\"the perverse intimacy of the victim and the jailer\\". A system that does this, in order to sustain itself, HAS to have a means of each party being able to deny the humanity of the other and fully believe it. <br /> <br />The defeat of giving in to that is deeply shaming and virtually impossible to resist (at least on every level). One of the first things the regime did was outlaw most of the types of entertainment that would have had people mixing with each other in the public square. On the surface, they did this for moral reasons -- no watching Western movies, no listening to Western music, no getting emotional in public, etc. But certainly it couldn't have hurt that this divorced people from their sense of common culture and from most venues they would have had to exchange ideas or ask each other questions. Once the people are divided and isolated and lonely, it's much easier to force their submission.  Thus the girls are \\"without a history\\". They exist in this culture-less suspension. Now that they're broken and alone, the regime can step in as a comforting parent, reassuring them and telling them what they think and what they believe. Eventually, it reaches the point of dependence -- they don't know what they think without the regime telling them and this can even appear to be a choice, a preferable option, something to defend to anyone who challenges it even though it's eating them alive. <br /> <br />Some of the parallels to the post-September-11 United States were eerie! The color threat levels that were used to keep people in a constant state of fear. The constant propaganda that they were \\"liberating Iraq\\", doing Iraq a favor for which the Iraqis would be grateful, even while the Iraqis were dropping bombs on them. The way religion is sold to them like a commodity even while it's really the vehicle for selling oil. Surely, now that she's living in the US, these parallels must keep the author awake at night! <br /> <br />She even touched a little on the psychology of people living under this kind of pressure. They go from a wistful hope to anger to defeated acceptance. When the girls are defining \\"upsilamba\\", one of them says it's \\"the impossible joy of a suspended leap\\". They're still wanting things that they can't even fathom as possible. Then when Henry James goes on trial in class, she notes that people are more likely to get angry about something they think they SHOULD understand but don't than if they realize it's something very difficult and they don't hold themselves accountable for understanding it. Then Mahtab goes to jail and, when she gets out, marries immediately to \\"prove she's not political\\". Banality to avoid brutality, perhaps? But then isn't it Mahtab who wishes she could go back to jail because the solidarity of it was more comforting than the alienation on the outside? That hope is easier to let go of because, as long as you have it, you have something left to lose. <br /> <br />Ultimately, what makes the \\"memoir in books\\" idea so powerful is that contrast between the imagination of fiction and the way imagination is ripped from them during the revolution. I think that's the key to all the rest of this. There was no way to really undo these people, to brainwash them essentially into the principles of the Islamic Revolution, unless and until, their imaginations could be destroyed. <br /> <br />The behavior of Nafisi's students is, at times, not credible. This really wasn't a flaw in the novel. It's just thatthe students were all so involved and so intent on learning and involved in their own process. It was a quite a contrast to the volumes of American students who just do the bare minimum they can in college to squeak by and couldn't care less about their own learning as long as there's a keg this weekend. Maybe there was a similar apathy in pre-revolution Iran and Nafisi <br />just focused on her more promising and engaging students. <br /> <br />The only real flaw was the way she ran the dialogue together and didn't use quotation marks. Especially at the beginning, I had a <br />hard time reading it because of that.	2005-01-07

She has a weird haircut and the only boy she likes is intimidated by her intelligence. Then the day comes when her divorced parents sit her down together and tell her that, since her father is the king of Genovia, she's the princess!

Her constant awfulizing even becomes funny after awhile. If you can take this book as a cute fairy tale, it says some nice things about adolescents learning to accept themselves and their families for what they are.	2005-01-01

He knows all the prime numbers up to 7,057 and can solve puzzles that stump PhDs. However, he cannot understand metaphors, jokes, or human emotion. Christopher has Asperger's Syndrome, a form of autism. When his neighbor's dog turns up brutally murdered, Christopher puts his supreme logic to work in solving the mystery. However, he doesn't get far before the clues he is uncovering point to the mystery of his parents' separation and a world of adult emotion and motivation that is challenging him for him to understand.  <br /> <br />I was impressed by the creation of such an utterly believable narrator and the author's insight into his disability. It wasn't a story about Christopher; the story really WAS Christopher. Right down to prime numbers for the chapter titles. I felt like I knew this kid. And because I cared about him so early on, for the most part, the tangential style didn't bore me. I found it interesting because I found the workings of the narrator's mind interesting (at least at first -- more on this later). The author obviously has a great deal of empathy for kids with perceptual disabilities. He understands the details of how their minds work and, more importantly, he respects them and their process. Christopher, at times, seems hyperaware of his own brain processes (e.g. describing his mind as like a computer doing a search). But then, at times, he's wrong -- for example, saying that he can't fantasize about things that haven't happened when he does this a lot, such as fantasizing about being an astronaut or imagining who might have killed Wellington. <br /> <br />Simplicity is the book's greatest strength, I think. Christopher is profound because he doesn't try to be -- he just tells the truth and people with \\"normal\\" perceptual abilities see the depth of what he's saying (I underlined: \\"Prime numbers are what is left when you have taken all the patterns away. I think prime numbers are like life. They are very logical but you could never work out the rules, even if you spent all your time thinking about them.\\") In the same way, Christopher is touching because he not only doesn't try to be, he isn't able to be. He's the perfect narrator because he can't narrate in any of the ways we expect a story to be told -- he doesn't understand metaphor, he doesn't understand emotion, he can't put anything into its cultural or social context. So anything that would make a story like this glurgy or heartwarming is impossible. Christopher just tells it exactly the way it is and it's the process that happens in the reader's own mind that creates the reader's emotional response to Christopher. He is the ultimate non-mainpulative storyteller. <br /> <br />The only glurge risk is that readers might try to feel Christopher's emotions FOR him and wind up thereby pitying him (which I think would be brought on by how much this book was hyped as a book about autism or disability, not anything that Haddon actually included in the text). <br /> <br />This story reminds me of the archetype of the Holy Fool -- the one who is mocked and scorned as too simple-minded to understand the complexities of the real world but who, in his simplicity, has a better understanding of the truly important things in life (Forrest Gump is an example of the same archetype, but, of course, it's ultimate glurge). For example, Christopher sees right through the euphemism \\"special needs\\" that's designed to spare his feelings while, ironically, he sees how the other kids can use it as much as an insult as slurs like \\"retard\\". Though I might have found this book more emotionally powerful had such a big deal not been made that Christopher was autistic (which he probably wasn't -- he probably has either Asperger's or a pervasive developmental disorder). It took me awhile to notice that Haddon never defines Christopher as autistic -- this book was billed by the publisher and others as \\"a book about an autistic kid\\". Haddon himself simply presents Christopher as he is and leaves the reader to determine whether Christopher is a \\"normal\\" boy. I was expecting his disability to play a greater role in the story than I think it does or think it should. <br /> <br />I did eventually start skimming some of the rambling. I don't think I lost any interest or caring for either Christopher or the workings of his mind. It may have been that as the story progressed, I became more concerned with the plot and less concerned with the pattern on the train-car seats. Or maybe I just got tired of the details. But the minutae I found so appealing at first did start to wear on me in the second half of the book. <br /> <br />Christopher's father is an equally interesting character. Is he sympathetic or despicable? I could never decide. Some of his actions are so extreme and so horrible -- telling Christopher his mother is dead, killing the dog. Yet he is created in such a way that I truly believed he thought he was doing the best thing for Christopher. Certainly, he was the one best able to parent Christopher on a day-to-day basis. The more I found out about him, the more I wanted to hate him, yet I found I wasn't able to. <br /> <br />On a similar note, this book left me wondering what exactly love is. Christopher is incapable of processing emotion. Does this mean he can't love? Yet he seems to love his mother, father, Siobhan, Toby. He seems to understand that, by taking care of him, Siobhan and his father love him. Yet most of us accept that there is an emotional aspect of love that goes beyond just caring for someone's daily needs. So then what is love? Does Christopher only understand part of it?	2004-12-31

William Kane is the son of a wealthy Boston banking conglomerate. \\"Abel\\" Rosnovski (who takes the name when he immigrates to the United States) is the orphaned child of a Polish peasant. William's life is shaped by wealth, political connections, and an Ivy League education. Abel's will is honed as he escapes Russian imprisonment and fights his way to the United States for a better life. When a banking deal goes awry between William's company and Abel's hotelier employer, Abel is left at the helm of one of the largest hotel chains in the country and face-to-face with his new arch-enemy, William Kane.  <br /> <br />An appropriate book coming from an author many Brits describe as a ruthlessly meglomaniacal and corrupt politician.  William's father is almost a caricature of selfish evil even while such selfishness is condoned by the book's absence of condemnation of it. <br /> <br />The writing itself is fairly prosaic.  The shifts between William's point of view and Abel's is, at times, jarring.  Though as we watch the men grow from boys and develop their respective strengths, it becomes eerily difficult to decide whom to root for in the upcoming battle that is pathetically transparent from the beginning. <br /> <br />Archer apparently aspired to be the next Steinbeck and while he fails, he didn't fail that badly.	2004-12-30

Years later, when they are reunited and marry, they are the same age. This is possible because Henry suffers from Chrono-Displacement Syndrome, a genetic disorder that causes him to involuntarily time travel to moments of emotional significance for him, such as the childhood of his future wife or the scene of his mother's death. Clare and Henry try to lead a normal life and normal marriage in spite of Henry's frequent and dangerous disappearances to the past. They hold down jobs, visit friends, and try to have children in the balance of a passionate love for one another, the trials of Henry's disability, and what it means for their future together.<br /><br />Niffenegger was able to make the time travel aspect comprehensible relatively early on (I think by page 40-50 I had caught onto the gist of it) and, while it was complicated, she presented it in such a way that I never really had to think about it.  I have to give her credit for using multiple flashbacks (the domain of the amatuers) in a way that really avoids looking amatuerish.<br /><br />Time travel has an interesting role in this story. Not only was Niffenegger able to pull it off believably, but she sets it up as a very painful disability rather than as a super-power.<br /><br />At times, Henry and Clare's voices merge and lack noticeable differentiation. If I were feeling charitable I could say this contributes to the intensity of the connection between Henry and Clare, but, in reality, I don't see any evidence this was purposeful and think it just demonstrates a lack of skill.<br /><br />This book is going to live or die by whether the reader can sympathize with the relationship between Henry and Clare and here is where I give the book a mixed review.  I didn't find their emotional relationship entirely credible, but neither is the book 500 pages of wasted time.  Ignoring the dreamy sex scenes (which are so badly written some readers have speculated that Niffenegger must be a virgin), we really do get the chance to see the relationship between these characters evolve.<br /><br />But the author blows any credibility she might have had a literary author versus a writer of forgettable romances when we find out Henry's going to die around page 400. For one thing, it's too easy to see it coming.  Niffenegger had spent so much time building up a tearjerker that someone was going to have to die and, had she killed him off abruptly, it might have succeeded.  But the last 100 pages are nothing but teasers about Henry's upcoming death. I think when he finally died, I was supposed to feel devastated and instead all I could think was: FINALLY! She drags out that last bit of emotion, wringing it for every possible tear she can squeeze out of the moment, until it was too much and I just stopped feeling it. When he died, I didn't particularly care.<br /><br />As if this wasn't bad enough, she adds one last dollop of overdone sentimentality when Henry comes back and Clare's 82 and has been waiting for him all this time.  If I didn't care about his death, I cared even less about this cheap pandering for tears.have speculated that Niffenegger must be a virgin), we really do get the chance to see the relationship between these characters evolve. <br /> <br />But the author blows any credibility she might have had a literary author versus a writer of forgettable romances when we find out Henry's going to die around page 400.

The marriage between her friends begins to erode as their supplies dwindle and American tourists invade the pristine landscape.   <br /> <br />This is a strange and thought-provoking little book.  Rife with symbolism, Surfacing explores the feelings of an adult returning to the places of her childhood and even what it means to become an adult.

Henry runs a plantation of over 30 slaves, an irony that is not lost on the slaves themselves nor on Henry's father, Augustus, whose principled stand against slaveholding by free blacks costs him very dearly. When Henry dies, his wife is unable to cope with her grief and life for his slaves is turned on its ear as slaves run away, an ambitious overseer plots to fill Henry's shoes, and slave patrollers descend with a vicious brutality.  <br /> <br />Jones writes of the fictional Virginia county of Manchester and peoples it with a host of vivid characters and their interrelationships. The disorderly flashabacks are disorienting, at least at first. Coupled with the sheer number of characters, it detracted from the story to spend the first couple chapters trying to not only figure out who was whom, but whether the same person who was a grown man in the last section is now suddenly a little boy in this one. <br /> <br />I appreciated that the story wasn't terribly sentimental. Jones doesn't yank on his readers' emotions. The characters are a mix of nobility and flaws.  In some ways, perhaps Jones was heavy-handed, but at least not in the sense that he made it sickeningly clear who I was supposed to lionize and who I was supposed to detest. (Thank you, I appreciate being allowed to decide that for myself and appreciate having it be a difficult decision.) <br /> <br />Elias' dream about running back to Celeste and Henry's realization that allowing the marriage would keep Elias from running away was very powerfully told. <br /> <br />There were a lot of repeat images that seemed like they should have been symbolic, but then it either petered out and didn't go anywhere or at least I didn't get it. For example, there's the hair-combing bit. First, with Elias and Celeste and later with Ralph and Clara. Then there's \\"no milk\\" -- first with Mary O'Donnell and later with Clarence's cow. <br /> <br />I found it disturbing how closely the patrollers mirrored police officers. I read a book not long ago about how the history of modern law enforcement is rooted in slave patrols. This made me want to read more. The book also got me pondering the connection between grief and oppression. I wonder, perhaps, if victims of oppression are inclined to deny it because to acknowledge it would be admitting to a wound of the soul so deep it would be overwhelming. What would that say about Henry and Moses' motivations? <br /> <br />One symbol I did find carried through was, of course, the map of the \\"known world\\". I'm sure there are multiple layers of meaning there. Not only the patroller's refusal to consider that the map was outdated and should have rightly included places like Florida (lovely imagery of refusing to consider one's own ignorance even in the face of evidence), but I also saw it as referring to Henry who, knowing the pain of slavery first-hand, still chose to take slaves himself because identification with Robbins comprised his \\"known world\\". It was also commented about Moses (and Henry too, if I remember correctly) that they knew the plantation by heart (Moses even knew what it's dirt tasted like), but once they were outside their \\"known world\\", they were so lost, they wouldn't even know which direction was north. Then Alice's map at the end brings the image full-circle -- the depth and breadth of the \\"known world\\" has changed and grown. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed the omniscient voice telling us the circumstances of each character's death, especially that Tessie lived to be almost 100 and still had the doll Elias made for her. I thought this voice was very sobering and grounding. The only downside to the omniscient narrator is that I never got a clear point of view. I thought the characters were intriguing and well-drawn but I never got to the see the world or the events through their eyes.	2004-12-27
US	17087465	RHQZK5UB675PN	055321263X	115882645	The Woman in White (Bantam Classics)	Books	4	25	27	N	N	Wilkie's Women	In the 143 years since its publication, Wilkie Collins' The Woman in White (Random House Modern Library Classics, 1860) has never gone out of print. Originally serialized in Charles Dickens' weekly journal All the Year Round, it outsold Dickens himself in London and New York in 1860. <br /> <br />The novel (and Collins himself) is considered the forerunner to the modern mystery genre and the premise is as simple as it is delightful. London artist Walter Hartright is sent to Cumberland to teach drawing to two half-sisters. He falls instantly in love with Laurie Fairlie, the younger of the two, who is betrothed to a man of noble blood. When it becomes obvious that the fair and delicate Laura's new husband has dastardly intentions, Walter and the older, spinster sister, Marian, are set off on a thrilling chase to rescue Laura and solve the riddle of the woman in white. <br /> <br />Part of the ongoing appeal of The Woman in White is certainly its status as a paragon of mid-Victorian literature. England in 1860 was a rural and aristocratic society coping with the rise of industrialization, urbanization, and the effects of a rapidly-growing middle class on the ideals of democracy. Literature of this time focused on realism - the creation of believable behavior, setting, and psychologically credible characters - combined with sensationalism - high drama and volatile passions. <br /> <br />Victorian readers expected a happy ending to a story that provided social commentary on the present condition of England and Collins delivered both. The Woman in White serves up a critique on class relations, insane asylums, foreigners, and Victorian feminism. <br /> <br />The story is told in a series of first-person narratives, each picking up where the other left off and continuing the plot from his or her own point of view. Collins based this style on court trials he witnessed while attending law school. His progressive class consciousness is revealed in giving a narrative voice toservants who help tell the story, while denying a voice to upper-crust characters such as Laura and her husband, Sir Percival Glyde. <br /> <br />Additionally, like much of Victorian literature, Collins addressing the question of what constitutes a gentleman. The rise of the British middle class spawned a debate as to whether money or morals conferred gentlemanly status. The evils of Sir Percival and his Italian mastermind, Count Fosco, compared to the innocent honor of the lowly drawing master place the designation of gentleman with a kindly heart rather than a thick wallet. Though Collins avoid eat-the-rich didacticism - Laura herself is quite wealthy, but not a villain. <br /> <br />The subplot of madness serves to show up the deplorable conditions of the Victorian asylum where it was possible to be falsely restrained by greedy relatives who then obtained all one's property. Several prominent cases like this preceded the publication of The Woman in White. Forced commitment to an asylum is a common theme in Victorian literature, probably reflecting fears over the narrow range of acceptable behavior that was considered normal and sane. The book's continued popularity may speak to a universal fear of losing one's identity, of having the whole world think we're crazy simply for speaking the truth. <br /> <br />Collins' views on foreigners are alluded to in his treatment of two central characters, both foreign-born Italians. Walter's servant, Pesca, is a bumbling fool but a loyal friend. Count Fosco is evil, yet cultured and clever. The apparently negative portrayal of Italians may be partially due to the British fear of Catholics during the Pope's vie for power in the mid-19th century. More likely, they were a product of the British Empire and the Crimean War, which ended shortly before publication. Victorian Brits justified the Empire with a belief that foreigners were irrational, childlike, irreligious, criminal, hypersexual, and dirty. The Italians were specifically targeted because they sided with the Austro-Hungarian Empire during the war. That Collins created Pesca and Fosco to be quirky and engaging characters is probably progressive in the same sense as a modern American writer might create a Middle Eastern Muslim character to be appealing to the reader without becoming a caricature of either good or bad qualities. <br /> <br />The Woman in White is probably best known as an expose' on the lot of the Victorian woman. Feminism in Victorian times is still recognizable today, influenced as it was by liberal Protestant evangelism, enlightenment appeals to reason, and the rise of communitarian socialism as a strong political force. \\"Ladies' reading societies\\" were cropping up in response to Susannah Wright urging women to \\"read yourselves into awareness\\". John Stuart Mill was being arrested for distributing information on birth control and attacking the traditional family, saying child-rearing should be communal. <br /> <br />Collins himself was known for being unsympathetic to the traditional family. He lived in a polygamous arrangement with two women he never married and once said his writing \\"dramatizes the domestic horror of marriage\\" and showed up the vagaries of marital law. <br /> <br />The novel compares four distinct female characters - Laura; her half-sister, Marian; Count Fosco's wife, Eleanor; and Anne Catherick, the titular women in white herself. Marian is arguably the story's richest character. Collins never mocks her and the reader is not left pitying her even though a Victorian spinster carried the stigma of pity. She mirrors Fosco's cleverness and culture, but for good instead of evil. Unexpectedly, at the time of publication, men contacted Collins wanting to know if Marian was based on a real woman because they wished to meet such a woman. It begs the question of whether the ideals in weight, beauty, and temperament to which women strive to please men have ever been what men really wanted in the first place. <br /> <br />In the shadow of Marian, there's Madame Fosco - temptress and shrew turned dutiful wife. Her subservience is wound into Count Fosco's villainy, yet Laura's subservience remains a symbol of virtue (perhaps Collins avoiding didacticism again). <br /> <br />In spite of her sweetness, Laura remains a two-dimensional character. The plot revolves around her, yet she's as lifeless on the pages as one of her own drawings. In the end, we're left pitying Laura's weakness rather than Marian's spinsterhood, which may have been Collins' intention. <br /> <br />But if Laura is the bright side of virtuous Victorian womanhood, Anne Catherick is its dark underbelly. Her truthful tongue and sharp mind mark her as insane. Her ineffectual weakness and lack of male protection are exaggerated into madness where she whispers in and out of the story - the wraith-like woman in white. <br /> <br />As a feminist novel, it's not without flaw. Collins stoops to portraying Marian as ugly and mannish, implying that she can't catch a man because of her indelicacy and her facial hair. (In point of fact, the number of mid-Victorian spinsters rose because of the women outnumbered the men.) We do watch Marian pine for love, yet it's her beautiful, passive half-sister who is rewarded with it. Though, given Collins' views towards marriage, he may have bestowed this as an ironic mixed reward. Rather than being strong or cunning in standing up to Sir Percival, Laura mostly resorts to the tired stereotype of childlike sneakiness. And here the book falls into the common trap, at least for the modern reader, of mistaking Laura's cunning or Marian's wit and spunk for genuine feminist analysis. This is a problem even in modern entertainment where we're supposed to believe the heroine is liberated when, in fact, she's only making cynical and sarcastic one-liners. But overall, Collins effectively shows the futility of both options for women - the lack of means and social stigma of spinsters and the legal and social disappearance of marriage. The modern reader is left to ponder whether this has really changed. <br /> <br />Characters aside, the heightened language of the novel is lovely and begs to be read aloud, despite a criticism of Collins is that his language was too flowery to accurately reflect Victorian English and, because he was paid by the word, some passages become unnecessarily wordy. To the modern taste, the book is simply too long for a suspense novel, weighing in at 645 pages. <br /> <br />The plot structure of the serial narratives diverges from the typical Victorian novel in which it was common for the author to interject with commentary in his or her own voice, addressed to the reader. The narrative format allows all the advantages of the omniscient viewpoint while keeping the immediacy and personal feel of the first person. <br /> <br />Some holes in the plot are distracting. A woman believed dead is able to marry. Chronological errors in dates (the result of the original serial publication) leave events occurring in nonsensical order. Characters appear and disappear with inexplicable suddenness. Some coincidences strain credibility. A case of typhoid fever figures into the story twenty years before typhoid was officially diagnosed (though it had become a matter of public health and medical inquiry in England at the time of publication). <br /> <br />The quality of The Woman in White is clearly overstated today because of its status as a period piece. In its day, it was little more than a trashy novel for mass entertainment - only slightly less degraded than the modern soap opera because of the evident social commentary. The overemphasis placed on The Secret is a cheap gimmick to lure the Victorian reader into purchasing the next installment. <br /> <br />In spite of this, and in addition to the social commentary, The Woman in White has literary value. Collins plants a fabulous story into the genre of the sensation novel. He uses the kindof symbolism meaningful to a Victorian audience - for example, fire was a common symbol for the tensions between stable, conservative, and restricting values versus destructive and liberating passionate emotion and sexuality. Witticisms are planted into the characters' names - Pesca can't swim yet, his name is Italian for \\"fish\\"; Fosco means \\"gloom\\"; Percival refers to the knight seeking the Holy Grail. <br /> <br />Collins' use of word painting is evocative and typically Victorian - for example, the description of Blackwater Park is both explanatory and creates an aura of evil. The coincidences, epiphanies, and mistaken identities are fun even when they're exaggerated. All in all, The Woman in White is likely to continue entertaining readers for another 140 years to come.	2004-12-24

Not that I don't usually recognize the pains and injustices and human suffering....but it's hard for a writer to make me feel for the tale of Linda in Detroit when I know plenty of Lindas in my own backyard and my priorities lie with them. <br /> <br />However, Ehrenreich has moved far beyond that. She writes with the clarity, the conciseness, the analytical ability to which I aspire myself. At times the sheer absurdity of her situation even brings her to employ some humor. She is able to repeat her central point: low wage workers in America are not paid enough to survive, without belaboring the point because she tackles that central point from so many different angles. <br /> <br />I came to care about the people she described precisely because she didn't attempt to use their suffering to yank on my emotions. She just reported what she saw. Then she went beyond that to talk about the degradations, the hopelessness, and what she called \\"the repetitive stress injuries of the soul\\" that plague people stuck in wage slavery. (That phrase will stick with me for a long time.) <br /> <br />This is well-researched and properly documented. It's not hard to see why the right is calling Ehrenreich \\"the Satan of Chapel Hill\\" and \\"the biggest enemy of God and the American family\\". Her honesty and courage have made her one of my new heroines (turns out she was at demo in DC that I was also attending and she may have been there when I was arrested, but I never knew it). The only pity is that Michael Moore is hogging the attention that Ehrenreich so richly deserves.	2004-12-24
US	17087465	RSJTTSQURNQYJ	0452282152	858318999	Girl with a Pearl Earring: A Novel	Books	1	19	33	N	N	Best sleep aid on the market	Johannes Vermeer's most famous painting, Girl with a Pearl Earring, has touched and mystified audiences since it was completed in 1665 in Delft, Holland. It depicts a beautiful, if simple, young woman in three-quarter profile wearing an unusual headdress and a large pearl teardrop earring. The girl's wide eyes and slightly parted lips suggest a startling and <br />innocent sensuality. Unfortunately, Tracy Chevalier's novel of the same title (Plume Printing, 2001) captures none of the elegance nor timelessness of the original Vermeer. <br /> <br />The plot is similar to a school creative writing assignment to concoct a story based on a still-life picture. Chevalier imagines the painting's young subject as 16-year-old Griet - the daughter of a painter whose family is thrown into poverty by his sudden blindness. In desperation, the family sends Griet to work as a housemaid in the home of Johannes Vermeer. Griet there encounters about 170 pages' worth of discomforts - from fearing the family's Catholic faith to finding virtually everyone in the household unpleasant. Vermeer's wife, Catherina, envies her; his mother-in-law, Maria Thins, intimidates her; and his tiresome daughters pester her. Longsuffering Griet tolerates these irritations in silence out of devotion to her master who, for no comprehensible reason, enlists Griet to help him with his art. She buys his supplies, mixes his paints, and begins advising him on ways to improve his work. All the while she is falling into a sort of canine awe of him. Eventually he is moved to paint her wearing his wife's earrings - presumably because he finds Griet more attractive and engaging than the shrew to whom he is married, though we know from the outset this move is destined to end very badly. <br /> <br />Sounds dull? It is. This novel has to be one of the better sleep aids on the over-the-counter market. The real low point comes when Griet spends three pages describing her dusting routine. <br /> <br />What it lacks in plot it lacks further in character. The story is told in first-person by Griet. This was Chevalier's first mistake. We spend 220 pages painfully aware that we are inside the head of someone who doesn't think much. Griet simply isn't fleshed-out enough to go through any changes as a result of her experience and therefore engender any interest or sympathy. <br /> <br />The prose itself is, at best, uninspiring and, at worst, distracting. Chevalier makes no attempt to use language that will give us the feel of 17th century Holland. Her modern turns of phrase give Griet the voice of a simple-minded Midwestern girl from present-day America. The short sentences and limited vocabulary suggest she was striving for an elegant simplicity and wound up with something like the writing of a 7-year-old. <br /> <br />Fond as she is of reminding us that she is illiterate, Griet demonstrates a sudden and sophisticated knowledge of modern art theory, altering Vermeer's subjects while he's not looking and instructing her master in colors, shape, and light. <br /> <br />Chevalier herself holds a Masters degree in creative writing and cited only two references used to research the book - one on Dutch history and one on Vermeer. This may account for some of the novel's shortcomings. It would appear she set off armed with only three bits of knowledge - that 17th century Dutch Protestants didn't like Catholics, that most of them were <br />illiterate, and the painting itself - which she proceeds to belabor at every turn. It's clear by the end that Griet's sexual awakening and Vermeer's unspoken passion are symbolized in the earring itself. But the earring is obviously manipulated to Mean Something that it loses its power to move the reader. <br /> <br />The premise itself is interesting and could have made for a delightful story. While many art historians believe Vermeer's subject was likely one of his daughters, part of the painting's appeal is that no one really knows. Evidence suggests that it was not a commissioned portrait and the painting didn't surface until after Vermeer's death. The lovely girl with her pearl earring and wide-eyed innocence and sensual mouth have kept their secrets almost completely for 340 years. And the literary world would have been better off if Chevalier had left it that way. If you're tempted to pick up Girl with a Pearl Earring, spare yourself and view the painting instead.	2004-12-22

In the face of this lack, I propose we look to George Orwell, whose acute observations and objectivity can bring a timelessness to the issues we're facing today.<br /><br />Orwell was a humanist and a socialist whose writing was primarily concerned with how individuals are affected by social and political constructs. After graduating from Eton College in 1917, Orwell joined the Indian Imperial Police in Burma. He resigned in 1927 and published his first piece of fiction - Burmese Days - in 1934.<br /><br />Burmese Days is the presumably semi-autobiographical story of John Flory, a British expatriate with a disfiguring facial birthmark who oversees timber camps in remote Kyauktada, Burma. Flory is a weak and lonely man who retreats to the European Club for drink and the questionable companionship of the other expatriates who share his outpost. Flory befriends a native doctor, Veriswami, who is vying with the novel's villain, U Po Kyin, for admission to the Club. When British debutante Elizabeth Lackersteen arrives in Kyauktada, Flory falls instantly in love with her, creating a weakness for U Po Kyin to exploit.<br /><br />Of all his work, Orwell liked Burmese Days the least. He later felt it was a lifeless story, littered with purple prose. The characters are all fairly odious and hard for the reader to develop any affinity for. They are caricatures, used heavy-handedly to make a moral point. Flory is a coward who is amused by the exotic Oriental culture, but displays little respect for the Burmese people - particularly his mistress, Ma Hla May. U Po Kyin is a corrupt magistrate, willing to instigate a rebellion in order to bolster his position by suppressing it. Dr. Veriswami is a turncoat who tongue-bathes British superiority and holds his own people in contempt. Elizabeth is unwaveringly shallow and heartless, while the Club is peopled by a colorful variety of drunkards and bigots.<br /><br />Orwell's writing is descriptive and succinct, rushing to its devastating climax in less than 150 pages. While this is an important book, it's not a highly readable one. It's loaded with Mon-Khmer words that are left to the reader to define from context. It's unnecessarily melodramatic and at times hard for the post-modern reader to swallow. We're given no opportunity to identify with the \\"wrong\\" characters, which appears didactic to a reader accustomed to modern literature, and the pace of the story has events unfolding at a speed that strains credibility. For example, Flory falls in love with and becomes intent upon marrying Elizabeth too quickly for the reader to sympathize.<br /><br />But really this story's value lies in its place in the Orwell canon as an anti-imperialist polemic. The British Empire began in 1607 with the colonization of Jamestown, Virginia. It was established in order to gain raw materials for British industrial markets and included parts of Canada, the Carribean, Africa, India, and Australia. In 1886, England colonized Burma in order to protect the Indian border, but then discovered Burma was a good source of teak-wood. After three and a half centuries, the Empire ended when Britain joined the European Parliament in 1973.<br /><br />Britain saw its purpose in occupation as an attempt to \\"educate\\" the natives to the British way of life which the imperialists considered an improvement for the countries under their rule. Meanwhile, the expatriates, who were often misfits in England, lived isolated from the natives and enjoyed a sense of superiority that they lacked in their homeland. This was unique among other colonial powers, such as France, which granted the natives of their colonies full rights of citizenship and lived among them, enjoying social relationships and often intermarrying.<br /><br />Such racism and xenophobia is an overarching theme in Burmese Days and it's plausible that Orwell wrote the book as a sort of public penance for his own actions in Burma. The members of the European Club, whose classes would likely not have mixed in Britain, are united in Burma by their hatred and fear of the \\"local niggers\\". Flory is constantly torn between his own moral integrity and the social construct of domination that dictates he \\"forever dance the danse du pukka sahib for the edification of the lower races.\\"<br /><br />That reality itself is socially constructed is a consistent Orwellian theme, discovered in Burmese Days and perfected in 1984. In some ways, it's unfair to fault Orwell for not having this theme completely developed fifteen years before he wrote his definitive work. In colonial Burma, the consensual reality is that of the superiority of British society. Even as U Po Kyin and Veriswami go head-to-head, they do so with the assumption that their British masters are more worthy and more civilized than they, which fuels their desire for acceptance by the European Club.<br /><br />Ultimately, Flory's intuitive sense that colonialism confounds human decency leaves him bitterly lonely. It's impossible for him to live sanely in a world that functions on an insane premise. Flory's relationship with Elizabeth underscores the power of loneliness to persuade the human heart to act against its better judgement. We are simply willing to conform to a reality that contradicts the evidence of our senses if it will spare us the gnawing pain of isolation.<br /><br />For Flory, this has tragic and horrifying results. But this is a story that couldn't end well because neither theconformity nor the self-doubt imposed by colonialism can possibly end well. Flory's fate is symbolic of the fate of the British Empire, of imperialism itself, and finally of ourselves if we fail to heed the lessons of our history and use them to analyze the constructed paradigms of our modern world.	2004-12-21

When it first emerged in three volumes from the British publishing house of Smith, Elder, and Company under the nom de plume of Currer Bell, it was popular in spite of being deemed unsuitable reading for the Christian woman. Ironically, a century and a half later, it's come under feminist criticism for its allegedly archaic and weak depiction of the Victorian woman.<br /><br />The story itself is familiar to many. The orphaned Jane is left in the care of her mean-spirited aunt who pampers her own selfish children. The aunt can't abide Jane's willful temperament and banishes the child to Lowood, a charity school run by the hypocritical, Bible-thumping Brocklehurst. After disease epidemics for reform, Jane becomes a teacher at Lowood and then a governess for the adopted daughter of the mysterious Mr. Rochester - a man whose many secrets threaten to destroy Jane when she falls in love with him in spite of herself.<br /><br />In large part, the novel is autobiographical. Bronte herself was born in Yorkshire in 1816 and sent to live with an aunt when her mother died. She and her sisters were sent to Cowan Bridge - a strict Methodist charity school where two of Bronte's sisters died (and became the inspiration for Jane's saintly schoolmate, Helen Burns). Bronte became a teacher and then a governess herself, a position she detested.<br /><br />Jane Eyre is a blend of romance, Gothic horror, and a literary form known as Bildungsroman - an internal and external first-person account of coming-of-age. This is the most basic sense in which Jane Eyre is radical - most coming-of-age stories were (and, for that matter, continue to be) told about boys. Jane Eyre's story is not only about a girl, but about a girl who rebels against social conventions on her own principles.<br /><br />Ultimately, the story is about choices and extremes Jane faces and her journey to finding a middle ground that is suitable for her and doesn't compromise her personal integrity.<br /><br />Spiritually, Jane is faced with Brocklehurst - the epitome of the sanctimonious Evangelical movement. She then meets Helen Burns, whose love for God is certainly sincere, but leads to passivity and self-denigration. Later, Jane finds her counsin, St. John, whose religion is neither hypocritical nor meek, but leads to ambition and self-righteousness. Jane navigates the extremes to find her own understanding of love for God, ending her tale with, \\"Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus\\".<br /><br />Jane equally struggles to find her ambiguous place in the structure of Victorian class society. She comes from a monied family to whom she doesn't truly belong, giving her the social carriage and education of the aristocracy. Yet she works in the lower class jobs of teacher and governess reserved for unmarriageable women, where her intellect and her sense of self rebel, as they did for Bronte.<br /><br />But Jane's deepest conflict is between her need for independence and her desire for love. Rochester offers her love at the price of dependence. St. John offers her professional fulfillment at the price of love - a conflict I found meaningful and with which I could deeply identify. The dichotomy remains 156 years later<br /><br />between ambitious, independent women living lives devoid of love versus dutiful wives and mothers living lives devoid of self-awareness and intellectual satisfaction. Even if few women desire these extremes, they continue to be offered and expected and refusing them can be the same source of pain and confusion that Jane experiences.<br /><br />Her love for Rochester is tempting because he can offer her two things, even as a mistress, which she has lacked her whole life - money and a sense of family. Jane realizes that the lack makes her needy and that neediness can never be the basis for an equitablerelationship.<br /><br />Rochester is a basically good man, though deeply flawed. He hasn't locked Bertha away which, to a Victorian reader, would have indicated his kindness given the atrocities of the Victorian asylum. He adopts Adele with little reason to believe she's his own child. But Rochester's problems are largely his own doing and Jane is clearly his intellectual and moral superior - another factor unlikely to make for the equitable relationship Jane seeks.<br /><br />But he does tempt her and it's no accident that at the moment of her greatest temptation, Jane sees Bertha Mason - the symbol of Victorian wifehood - locked away to the point of bestial insanity. Is it any wonder Jane flees?<br /><br />The final third of the book - the \\"Whitcross section\\" - feels forced, overlong, and dull despite its importance to the story. In it, Jane finds her family and her inheritance while Rochester gains in humility and moral strength. With these needs fulfilled, Jane and Rochester are finally able to come together as true equals.<br /><br />The book's epilogue, beginning, \\"Reader, I married him\\" has been the source of much debate. Many feel the entire last chapter in which, a decade later, Jane extols the blessings of married life, indicate that Jane has submitted at last to the mundane wifehood expected of her. However, even the first sentence belies this conclusion - Jane is the subject of the sentence, not the object of it. Like everything else in her story, marriage is something she does for herself, not something that simply happens to her. In it, she describes her marriage as \\"free as solitude\\", in which talking and sharing one another's thoughts are their greatest pleasures. Rather than a dismal descent into dailiness, this is Bronte's summary - that women who remain true to their own integrity and give in neither to the temptation of ambition nor that of meek dependence find what they seek - a love shared by two whole people who are able to remain fully themselves.relationship.<br /><br />Rochester is a basically good man, though deeply flawed.

US	17087465	R1E2IMIG953PQY	0380778556	39495389	Rebecca	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Dreaming of Manderley	When is a romance novel not a romance novel?<br /><br />When it's a gothic suspense thriller fairy tale romance novel, such as Daphne duMaurier's Rebecca (Victor Gollancz, 1938, republished by Avon in 1971). The book's staying power can perhaps be best explained because it combines all the trashy, page-turning suspense of modern writers like Stephen King and John Grisham without the pedestrian prose that make King or Grisham such an insult to the intellect. Rebecca is well-crafted without requiring the same kind of concentration as a modern reader would employ when tackling the heightened language of older classics and it's fun without resorting to the formulaic styles of today's mass market paperbacks.<br /><br />The story is the first-person account of an awkward young maid who, while assisting her mistress on a vacation in Monte Carlo, falls in love with the dashing widower, Maxim DeWinter. Maxim marries her and whisks her off to his Cornish estate of Manderley, where the memory of his first wife, Rebecca, looms larger than life. While the shy narrator tries to fill the shoes of her sophisticated predecessor, Rebecca's presence haunts the foreboding mansion until the new, younger Mrs. DeWinter can find out exactly what became of Rebecca.<br /><br />For obvious reasons, Rebecca is considered an imitation of Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre - a haunting mansion with its own name ruled by a mysterious master with dark secrets about his first wife. But, stylistically, the two are very different. The poor little anonymous narrator of Rebecca lacks the strength and conviction of Jane Eyre's titular heroine. DuMaurier's is a darker novel than Bronte's and her protagonist's final victory is dubious, at best. While both novels have gothic elements, Jane Eyre strives for realism; Rebecca is a sinister fairy tale, with its melodrama and stilted, exaggerated characters. And, of course, Jane Eyre is Victorian.<br /><br />DuMaurier herself was shocked at Rebecca's popularity, saying she had written the novel merely as a study in human jealousy. But her readership saw it differently. First dramatized for radio by Orson Wells shortly after publication, then adapted for film by Alfred Hitchcock in 1940, Rebecca remains duMaurier's best-known and best-loved work, trumping even her 1952 short story, The Birds, which was also made into a Hitchcock film and is more often associated with him than with its original author.<br /><br />What duMaurier didn't acknowledge is that this rags-to-riches Cinderella story may contain its own Oedipal influences. DuMaurier was born in London in 1907 to actor-manager Gerald duMaurier, the son of artist and writer, George duMaurier. Her mother a sophisticated socialite, the young Daphne was closer to her father and followed in the artistic footsteps of the paternal side of her family. In 1943, she married Major General Sir Frederick Browning, who had lost his beautiful and worldly fianc&eacute; in an unusual accident. The constant sense of competition between the narrator and Rebecca may reflect duMaurier's own feelings of inadequacy in loving men whose hearts were already given to women far above her.<br /><br />Beginning with her first novel, The Loving Spirit, published in 1928, duMaurier's work reflects her passion for Cornwall. Manderley is based on Milton, near Peterbrough where duMaurier visited as a girl, and Menabilly in Cornwall, where she eventually settled with her husband and raised three children. When Hitchcock filmed Rebecca, starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine, du Maurier's only complaint was that he changed the setting to America, cutting out entirely her beloved Cornwall.<br /><br />In 1969, duMaurier was made dame for literary achievement, credited with writing the first gothic romance of the 20th century. She died on April 19, 1987. Two sequels were later published with the blessing of the duMaurier estate - Mrs. DeWinter, written by Susan Hill and published in 1993 by William Morrow and Company and Rebecca's Tale, written by Sally Beauman and published in 2001 by Little Brown.<br /><br />So what makes Rebecca a romance? This is not a tale of passionate embraces or the love at first sight of destined paramours. The emotions that are heightened are those of jealousy, inadequacy, and self-doubt. The narrator appeals to the gauche, insecure little girl in all of us who is given to flights of wild fancy and fears of improbable disaster. That we never know her Christian name underscores her subordination to Rebecca, whose name dominates the cover of the book as well as every corner of Manderley. It gives the sense that the narrator's life did not begin until her arrival at Manderley, at which time she gained the name of Mrs. DeWinter, albeit the second, of course. It also gives the reader a sense of intimacy with the narrator, as if, perhaps, we are a dear friend for whom repeating her own name would be redundant and unnecessary.<br /><br />But if it's not clearly a romance, it is thoroughly modern. Rebecca has no truly moral characters in spite of its melodrama. All its heroes are deeply flawed and face ethically ambiguous dilemmas. Its villains, if viewed in the proper light, may be sympathetic and we're given a chance to identify with the baddies. Nor is the ending clean and neat. From its opening line - one of the more well-known in modern literature - \\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again\\", the narrator tells us that she is writing from a place of relative peace, but still running from what happened to her as a naive young bride. When the final revelation comes, 300 pages later, it's uncertain how the narrator will respond and, in fact, her response seems incongruous with the rest of her character (arguably the novel's only flaw). However, like the narrator, Manderley is a place readers will dream of returning to again and again.	2004-12-19

When the women defeat them in open warfare, the men resort to seduction, pleading with the women to love and not abandon them. Michel Faber's bestseller, The Crimson Petal and the White (Harcourt, 2002), takes its title from the verse's seduction song and provides an ironic twist on Tennyson's theme. <br /> <br />The story centers on Sugar, a 19-year-old girl bred to prostitution in 1875 London. Intrigued by her description in a directory of city brothels, William Rackham - the heir to a perfume fortune - is drawn to, and quickly becomes obsessed with, Sugar. He purchases her from the brothel's madam, first ensconcing her in a London flat and later bringing her into his home under the guise of governess for his 6-year-old child. Within the Rackham household, Sugar becomes entangled with William's child-like, mentally unstable wife; his pious, insecure brother; and his needy, sorely-neglected daughter. <br /> <br />But don't be fooled by a plot that sounds simple. This isn't a Victorian regurgitation of hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold drivel like Pretty Woman (Touchstone Pictures, 1989) or its 1960's predecessor, Sweet Charity (Neil Simon, Dorothy Fields, and Cy Colmen, 1966). The novel's greatest strength is characterization. The story is peopled with stereotypical personas who, through Faber's unimpeachable attention to detail, become so human that it's difficult to put this novel down without feeling that each character has become a personal friend. <br /> <br />His storytelling takes a few risks which, even if they don't work perfectly, are commendable for the fact that they were difficult and, for the most part, work quite nicely. The story opens from the point of view of an unidentified second-person narrator whose role is to navigate the modern reader through the seediest streets of Victorian London. The narrator allows the story to unfold in a limited omniscient viewpoint without jostling the reader among different perspectives. In spite of the narrator's self-consciousness, it gives us a direct involvement in the story while keeping our awareness of our own 21st century paradigm. The narrator is humbling, reminding us in the face of temptation to judge the characters that we are merely interlopers in a world we don't fully understand. Within the first quarter of the book, the narrator fades out unobtrusively before the style has a chance to become grating. <br /> <br />In spite of Faber's narrative nod to the fact that he is a 21st century writer and not attempting to mimic Charles Dickens, he has incorporated some delightful echoes to Victorian literature. The interjections of the narrator directly to the reader, the book's length, its wordiness, and its unapologetic treatment of social issues are all reminiscent of the great 19th century novelists. While the language is modern, it's written in a lovely, melodic prose with the style of a tragic fairytale that can fool the reader into believing we're reading the heightened language of that era. <br /> <br />Faber himself holds a degree in Victorian literature and his research for the novel was phenomenal. Whatever criticism might be leveled against his work, you're unlikely to catch him in an historical error. If anything, the research is sometimes a bit heavy-handed, particularly in the first few chapters, which at times read more like an entertaining dissertation on England in the 1800s. Though unless a scholar of Victoriana, you'll thank him later when the minutiae, however awkwardly it may have been laid out in the beginning, allow you to slip into the story without subsequent confusion. <br /> <br />By the time we've acclimated ourselves to the story's setting, become emotionally invested in Sugar and the other characters, and become engrossed in the plot, the timeless and discomforting issues of the book become apparent. This is a story about the intersection of class and gender and the tragic ways it affects human relationships. <br /> <br />The seeming contrast between Sugar and William's wife, Agnes, narrows as the story progresses. Both women are trapped, by virtue of their sex, by a need to understand and appease men in order to appeal to them for their livelihood. As a result, both women are manipulative and rageful, albeit in different ways. Sugar manipulates with her sexuality while secretly penning gory fantasies of revenge against the men who have used her. Agnes manipulates with a docile girlishness while starving herself, fainting, overdosing on laudanum, and denying the existence of her daughter who poses a threat to Agnes' centrality as a needy child herself. <br /> <br />The apparent contrasts between Sugar and Agnes serve to underscore their basic similarities. Sugar's self-containment and independence versus Agnes' helpless weakness is deceptive. They're simply two different routes to the same goal. As the story unfolds, they subtly change places and like the Tennyson poem, \\"slip at once, all fragrant, into one\\". <br /> <br />Agnes and Sugar themselves are the titular crimson petal and the white. Agnes (a name that literally means \\"chaste\\") is a dainty and conventionally beautiful woman who is terrified of her body and its sexual function. The only way she can speak the truth is to act crazy. Sugar is coarse and bony and suffers from a disfiguring skin condition. As she climbs the ranks from whore to kept woman to governess,her understandable rage gives way to an almost canine ingratiating dependence. She waits for William's <br />attention like a dog for table scraps, massages his ego with practiced skill, and takes to spying longingly on his every move in an attempt to find the key to making herself indispensable to him. As William's fascination with her fades the more Sugar insinuates herself into his life, the more we're forced to examine the dichotomy that still exists between women men marry and those with whom they socialize and engage in mutually-satisfying friendships. <br /> <br />Faber's awareness of and attention to the female experience contrasts William's without ever vilifying William as a character. He is able to describe the ways women experience their own bodies, their sexuality, and their relationships with both men and other women with a level of detail that condemns William's inattentiveness (as well as its real-life counterparts) without demonizing William. If anything, William's obliviousness is pitiable only because we understand how common he really is. While he clearly loves both Sugar and Agnes, he comes no closer to truly understanding them than if they were a different species altogether - not because he is a callous person, but because his sex and its attendant social station never requires him to understand women nearly as well as they understand him. <br /> <br />It's in the relationships among the novel's women that class becomes particularly salient as well as emotionally-moving. When Sugar returns to the brothels of Church Street after weeks of the luxury of being a kept mistress, she visits with Caroline, a friend and fellow streetwalker. She is repulsed by the baseness of Caroline's environment and lifestyle and realizes that, despite holding the hands of dying prostitutes, she has never embraced another woman in friendship. And she can't now - she has begun to identify with the upper class and she sees that any charity she might bestow upon Caroline now would further alienate them. The competition for and identification with men have taken their toll on solidarity and class deals the final blow to what could have been unity in the face of an economic oppression that requires they remain desirable commodities, whether as wife, mistress, or whore. This \\"Uncle Tom Syndrome\\" has an uncomfortable timelessness. It remains an economic reality that many women's financial security rests on serving men, servicing them, or marrying them - all of which require more attention to a woman's desirability than to forging genuine connections with other women, who instead become an ever-present competition for male attention. <br /> <br />Faber's novel has been criticized for being unabashedly coarse in its crude language and unsentimental descriptions of sex acts. However, it misses the point to either focus overmuch on the role of sex in the story or to alternatively brush it aside in the quest for the book's deeper themes. Accepting sexuality is important to understanding the characters and their relationships. Yet it does a disservice to both to reduce the book to its sexual elements. The role of class is prominent here again. The lower class characters (Sugar, Caroline, etc.) exhibit a frankness about physicality and sexuality that is feared and avoided by the higher class characters (Agnes, William's brother, Henry, etc.). Faber's writing illustrates this with an enlightening reversal. The lower class characters show no more compunction about exposing themselves, relieving themselves, or douching (a Victorian method of birth control performed with caustic chemicals) than they would about wiping their noses. In contrast, the upper class characters fear this sexuality as though it were a tidal wave threatening to consume them, which Faber underscores with erotic descriptions of the most mundane elements of their lives. It's clearly not a matter just of <br />purity, but a fear of the connection and honesty that such sexuality implies and the alluring prose Faber uses to outline their lives leaves it nibbling disconcertingly at the edges of their existence, threatening them and challenging the reader to question our own comfort with bodies and sex as well as the source of our feelings about them. <br /> <br />At the heart of this contrast is the foil of Sugar and William's relationship in the relationship between Henry and the Widow Fox - a free-thinking, philanthropic Christian woman dedicated to rescuing girls from lives of prostitution. Henry and Emmeline Fox quietly pine for each other, fearing the runaway passion of consummating (or even admitting) their feelings for each other while Sugar and William's frequent sexual encounters serve only to alienate them further from one another. <br /> <br />These themes of temptations and cravings, of the way ordinary people are tossed about on the whims of social conventions which they fail to examine - leaves the reader wondering...who is the crimson petal and who is the white? It's not as obvious as the distinction between virtue and immorality implied by the title. Sugar is the whore who winds up in the unlikely position of acting as Agnes' guardian angel and more a mother to Agnes' child than Agnes herself. Agnes' fear of womanhood and all it implies devolves into a revulsion of eating, menstruating, and eventually becomes utter madness. Meanwhile, William unwittingly crushes them both like the metaphorical petals of the title. <br /> <br />As a written work, the novel is not without flaw.  Various plot threads are confusing and left not only unresolved but sometimes annoyingly unaddressed. The reader doesn't always know which details are significant. At 838 pages, the length (and even the book's weight) are cumbersome. Middle sections of the story tend to drag, leaving the rapid-fire climaxes at the end feeling forced and melodramatic. The resolution (quite contrary to earlier Victorian echoes in style) is abrupt and potentially unsatisfying.  However, a more resolved conclusion would have felt contrived no matter how Faber chose to end the tale. Throughout the novel, he is given to \\"life's not fair, baby\\" plot twists that are delightfully unexpected and the cliffhanger ending, while risky, leaves the reader wanting more and pondering the fate of the characters long after we've closed the book.	2004-12-18
US	17087465	R1WPVTK408YAEX	000716226X	630763881	The Bride Stripped Bare: A Novel	Books	5	15	17	N	N	Stripping the Reader Bare	If you're American, you may have a little trouble finding it. Thus far, the publisher has only distributed it in London and Sydney. But The Bride Stripped Bare by Nikki Gemmel (published anonymously by 4th Estate in 2003) is surprisingly worth the hunt. <br /> <br />The story jetes off the premise that the anonymous diarist's mother found the text after her daughter and grandson disappeared under mysterious circumstances, leaving only their car at the top of a cliff. Their bodies were never found. From there follows the inner secrets of the ostensibly perfect housewife - from her Marrakech honeymoon to her illicit Sevillian affair and her descent into a sexual awakening at the hands of strangers. <br /> <br />The book closes with an open letter from Gemmel explaining that she intended the book to be published without any connection to her due to \\"personal reasons\\". She quickly adds that the story is not autobiographical and berates the media for sniffing her out and \\"forcing\\" her to put her name to it. One would think the paparazzi had taken great interest in slapping her face on the cover of every tabloid. Given that without this tangential letter most readers would not associate the book with Gemmel, a cynic would wonder if this was all a marketing stunt. <br /> <br />Gemmel takes some fabulous stylistic risks - most notably in writing the entire diary in the second person. The effect is, at worst, a psychological distance created between the reader and the anonymous narrator that reflects the narrator's own internal separation from herself. She doesn't know who she is and, despite reading the most intimate thoughts in her head, neither do we. At best, when the ideas hit home, when they reflect something in the reader's own life or with which she can identify, the second person style gives the eerie sensation that the diarist is reading her interloper's mind. Not only is the anonymous bride stripped bare, but her reader as well. <br /> <br />Each chapter - dubbed\\"lessons\\" in the text - begins with a pithy quote from Household Science: Readings in Necessary Knowledge for Women by the Reverend JP Faunthorpe or A Woman's Words to Women on the Care of Their Health in England and India by Mary Scharlieb. These little dictums for women's lives include \\"making <br />a comfortable bed is a very important part of household work\\" and \\"girls can never be too thoughtful\\". As might be expected, the content of each quote loosely corresponds to the content of the ensuing chapter with a gruesome, if cliched, irony. <br /> <br />In fact, very little about this book is NOT cliche and, surprisingly, it works in spite of this. It tells a story that certainly wouldn't shock the reading public unless it had been published a good sixty years ago. When Lady Chatterley's Lover was first published by DH Lawrence in 1928, a woman's sexual secrets were uniquely titillating, but Gemmel's playing to a much more jaded readership these days. Even every possible feminist angle on the story has been done to death - unfulfilled housewife....trying to find herself...has a sexual awakening... *yawn* <br /> <br />The reader is left with many unanswered questions, not the least of which is why this anonymous woman chooses infidelity in a seedy sexual underground. Her husband holds no particular allure for her, but is, by her own account, attentive and kind. If he doesn't understand her, there's little indication that he's a cad. She suspects him of having an affair and he doesn't want her to work outside the home, but seems no more controlling or callous than the average person - which may have been Gemmel's point. Perhaps the narrator is simply bored. She has found the husband and baby to which so many women aspire and now she is looking down the long descent into dailiness and apathy and is looking for something to once again quicken her sense of vitality. <br /> <br />For whatever reason, the tension builds over the question of whether and how long the narrator can keep her secret life a secret. This book is so readable because it functions almost as a psychological deconstruction of its central character and leaves us asking how well we know the people close to us. For that matter, how well do we know ourselves?	2004-12-13

Mrs. Henry said I needed to live past fourteen years old before I would have a philosophy.\\"<br /><br />Yet she got well beyond three pages in Sue Monk Kidd's The Secret Life of Bees (Penguin Books, 2002). At 14, Lily Owen's life is spent longing for the mother she can barely remember and the hazy memory of her mother's death. In the rural South Carolina of 1964, racial violence is brutal and, when Lily's surrogate mother - the family's black servant, Rosaleen - falls victim, Lily and Rosaleen run away in pursuit of Lily's mother's identity and some sense of belonging. With only a handful of clues to guide them, Lily and Rosaleen are taken in by three eccentric beekeepers who set Lily on a course to understanding her family and growing up.<br /><br />We see the events unfold through Lily's frank and often humorous observations. Her lack of sentimentalism fortunately keeps this from falling into a hyperemotional, smarmy coming-of-age tale. Lily is a character with depth, insecurity, and human failings and, in not trying too hard to warm the reader's heart, Kidd ironically does just that.<br /><br />The book is peppered with references to the beehive and honey-making that allude to Lily's motherlessness and deep need for nurturance. Kidd allows these metaphors to unfold organically, without explanation, and entirely avoids beating us about the head with them.<br /><br />No matter the reader's own family history, The Secret Life of Bees is likely to strike a chord. It beautifully exposes the complexity of the relationships between mothers and daughters - the idolization, betrayal, guilt, and eventual understanding.<br /><br />In doing so, it quietly challenges the reader to define family for herself. Lily's journey is an exaggeration of the journey every woman takes to separate from her mother, define herself as a unique person, and then return to an acceptance of her mother as another grown woman.<br /><br />Woven in and around this, Kidd gives us a vivid portrayal of the civil rights era American south. Lily's relationship with Rosaleen and her budding romance with a young, idealistic black boy force her (and us) to confront unacknowledged assumptions about race.<br /><br />In the company of the beekeepers, Lily is introduced to the Black Madonna and the empowering rituals in which the local women - the Daughters of Mary - revere her. The Black Madonna is as old as pictures of the Virgin Mary. The earliest depiction stems from Africa and is probably an image of the African god Imhotepth and his virgin mother and is believed by some anthropologists to be the basis for the western world's Madonna and Child icons. Images of the Black Madonna appear all over the world and, at present, appear most frequently in France. But it's been controversial. American churches have been burglarized and vandalized to destroy the offensive idea that Jesus or his mother could have been black. As late as 1997, the Park Theatre in Union City, New Jersey was boycotted for showing a production of the Passion Play that depicted Jesus and Mary as black. While some Christians find the idea intolerable, having a god that looked like them -- in terms of both race and gender -- was a lot of what the Daughters of Mary found so empowering about her.<br /><br />The rituals themselves are likely to appear as odd to the reader as they do to Lily. But it's in these circles of women and the ritual portrayals of freedom from oppression that Lily begins to let go of her past and take up the self-nurturance of adulthood.<br /><br />The Secret Life of Bees is as hard to pigeonhole as it is to put down. It's a rich kaleidoscope, changing each time it's turned. It isn't clearly allegorical and yet it keeps the reader searching for something more that clearly lies in the intricate folds of the plotline. Who is true family and how do we find them? How do we recognize them when we find them? Do women need the divine feminine? Do we all need rituals to cope with overwhelming emotion and to reclaim inner strength?

US	17087465	R3SZVGTKEKZX7	0380721457	438763193	Mrs. Dewinter	Books	2	11	13	N	N	Back to Manderley	After the 1938 success of Daphne duMaurier's Rebecca (Victor Gollancz, 1938, republished by Avon in 1971), adaptations quickly followed of this dark tale of jealousy and innocence, murder and obssession. Following Orson Well' radio broadcast, Alfred Hitchcock produced a film version in 1940 starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine. It was only a matter of time before readers were given a sequel and the first emerged six years after duMaurier's death when British novelist Susan Hill was comissioned to pen Mrs. DeWinter (William Morrow and Company, 1993). <br /> <br />Hill picks up Rebecca's anonymous narrator ten years after the fire that destroys Manderley. When Maxim DeWinter and his wife return to England for the funeral of Maxim's sister. After a decade on the run, all the creepy characters from the duMaurier original crawl out of the woodwork to give Maxim's bride the heebie-jeebies. <br /> <br />Sadly, for fans of Rebecca, this sequel is a disappointment. Hill tries to hard to ape duMaurier's style by repeating oft-used phrases from the original text and capitalizing on the perception that Rebecca was inspired by Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. The result is far too many references to the narrator's awkwardness and few heavy-handed images lifted straight from Jane Eyre (e.g. Maxim's sister meets her husband in exactly the same way Jane meets Rochester). It's not even that Hill's writing is bad. In fact, for a modern writer, it's quite good. But it's still coarser and narrower in language than duMaurier's, giving the narrator a noticeably different voice. <br /> <br />Of course, it could be argued that a character would be expected to change in ten intervening years and that we are witnessing the maturation of the original novel's heroine. The trouble is, she doesn't particularly mature. Part of the appeal of Rebecca was the narrator's naivete and insecurity mixed with her vivid (and often overactive) imagination. But now that she's grown up and her charming flights of fancy have been curbed by circumstance, her innocence is misplaced and more than a little tedious. The epiphanies that come to her in Mrs. DeWinter, had they really taken ten years to cross her mind, leave the reader wondering if our sweet bride isn't rather dim-witted. <br /> <br />Such a poor review is perhaps unfair to Hill, who is certainly an accomplished novelist in her own right. Born in 1942 in Scarborough, Yorkshire, Hill published her first novel while still studying English at King's College - a sexy tale considered scandalous at the time that quite embarrassed the young writer. She later gained some prestige with the publication of A Change for the Better (Ulverscroft 1996) and The Woman in Black (Macmillan Hein ELT, 1992), among others. She married Shakespearean scholar Stanley Wells in 1975 and, since the death of her daughter in 1984, has been a regular columnist for The Daily Telegraph and operates Long Barn Books publishing company. In 1991, she was contacted by the duMaurier estate to write a sequel to Rebecca. <br /> <br />First among Hill's ground rules for herself when developing the sequel was that she would do nothing to alter the original story retroactively. For example, she did not give the narrator a Christian name, which would have then \\"named\\" her for the original as well. This was a laudable and respectful goal, but has the unfortunate consequence of not allowing the story to go anywhere. Hill's hands-off approach means that no new revelations or plot twists unfold, leaving Mrs. DeWinter as mostly a rehashing of the salient plot points in Rebecca. The story loses momentum and meanders aimlessly for long sections of the novel. When Hill does attempt to inject some of the melodrama that makes Rebecca so delightful, instead of feeling purposefully heightened, it just feels cheesy and overdone. <br /> <br />To be fair, it probably would have been hard to find a better choice than Susan Hill to write a sequel. The question is whether such a sequel should ever have been attempted in the first place. The original Rebecca was written to leave unanswered questions in the reader's mind. Hill's excellent judgement in leaving those questions unanswered unfortunately dooms any sequel - including this one - to be unbearably dull.	2004-12-08
US	17087465	R30QFTO2F6EK89	0060572493	179511402	Shifting Through Neutral	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Defacing Beauty	The trouble with reviewing a book like Bridgett M. Davis' Shifting Through Neutral (HarperCollins 2004) is that Davis' first novel contains such elegance and subtlety that any attempt to analyze it is like explaining the punch line to a joke. The normal business of the reviewer becomes as meaningless and gauche as watching Anna Pavlova dance with Tigger. In looking for themes, for an angle to glom onto and extract, I feel like I am committing the waste observed by Davis' narrator as the auto manufacturers submit their models to corrosion testing, \\"defacing a thing of beauty in order to see how much abuse it could take\\". <br /> <br />This novel doesn't just tell a story. In fact, it's short on plot and very character-driven. It exposes the soul of a middle-class black family in 1970's Detroit through the eyes of young Rae Dodson. Her father is disabled by crippling migraines and her emotionally-distant mother is popping Valium when her older half-sister, Kimmie, returns from New Orleans where she vanished years ago to live with her father, their mother's one true love. Kimmie's return stirs in Rae a desire to understand her splintered family, to understand the mixed blessings of coming into womanhood, and to find what freedom truly means to her. But, when Kimmie's father comes for them, Rae is forced to confront the price of freedom and define the kind of person she wants to become. <br /> <br />Davis' work is all the more impressive given how badly it could have failed. A novel without a strong plot runs the risk of being a phenomenal bore. Yet she combines a beautiful, haunting prose with fully developed characters who are engaging and have depth while making it all seem effortless. The characters are three-dimensional, coming to life off pages of evocative imagery and very little exposition. Davis doesn't describe Rae; she allows the reader to come to know Rae. <br /> <br />Subtlety is by far Davis' strongest gift as a novelist. She uses her central images of cars, driving, and the road for the full range of those metaphors without ever manipulating the reader emotionally or, indeed, ever even allowing us to see the mechanics of what she's doing. The impact of Rae's observations about her family, about her job at the GM Proving Ground, about her awkward and tumultuous early love affairs brush over the reader's senses like gossamer cobwebs on sensitive flesh. <br /> <br />For this reason alone, Davis deserves recognition for writing important literary fiction and important African-American fiction specifically. Rae's voice as the narrator is undeniably the voice of a Midwestern black girl describing the lives of a black family with a realism and poignancy rarely found in popular fiction. She masterfully focuses on race while utterly transcending it - never portraying black families in the way white readers expect or want to hear, yet never allowing her readers to think the Dodson family \\"just happens to be black\\". This is both a black novel and an American novel and to place one over the other would be a disgrace to Davis' work. <br /> <br />Living in Motor City and watching those she loves take to the open road gives Rae a passion for cars and the independence they represent for her. Her story is that of the capricious nature of fate that comes with freedom. Sometimes thrilling, often cruel, and always unpredictable, Shifting Through Neutral exposes part of what it really means to be human, to love and be loved by an imperfect family, and to step fully into life.	2004-12-06
US	17087465	R1J5WDI77OE9MJ	0060723769	580443187	Into the Volcano: A Mallory & Morse Novel of Espionage	Books	3	7	14	N	N	Resurrecting Bond	Ok, so it's genre fiction. But, all things considered, it's pretty good genre fiction. Forrest DeVoe, Jr. is no John LeCarre, but (thank God) he's no Harlan Coben either.    Into the Volcano (HarperCollins, anticipated publication 2004), his debut novel under the DeVoe nom de plume, is a redux of every subgenre of the espionage thriller. A Dutch spy has been murdered in Istanbul and the dynamic duo of clandestine American operatives, Jack Mallory and Laura Morse, are sent to Turkey to avenge his death. Amidst Mallory's pursuit of Central Asian tail (of course) and Morse's silent pining for Jack (of course), they uncover a Cold War plot (of course) to smuggle all the gold out of the Turkish Treasury via underground tunnels. Posing as New York tourists in a troubled marriage, Jack lures the killers out into the open so they can kick some Soviet (of course). But the spectre of Cold War menace has just begun. The diabolical Russians are plotting world domination from their secret compound on the tropical island of He'Konau and Jack and Laura must storm the compound and disrupt their plans.    Your mission (should you accept it) is to get through this book without laughing. The premise is ridiculous, the characters have the depth of a frisbee, and the plot devices are cliched and predictable.    Still, for fans of the espionage novel, this is an interesting read in terms of its postmodern dedication to total eclecticism. The original British spy novels, marked by the 1907 publication of The Secret Agent by Joseph Conrad, were realistic, morally ambiguous, and nicely written, with little sex or violence. Until World War II, ethical ideas about espionage precluded glamorizing it in fiction. However, after World War II and the birth of the American spy novel, the operative's life became a metaphor for existential male angst - unambiguously heroic, unrealistic, violently macho, and chauvinistically sexy.    No one epitomized this more than Ian Fleming's 1950's-60's hero, James Bond. The name Bond - James Bond - is synonymous with spy fiction, though the books were misogynist and completely oblivious to their Cold War political context. Reveling in sadomasochistic sexuality, Bond resents being teamed up with a woman, whom he calls \\"a silly [...]\\" and likens to all women in their existence for his sexual recreation.    Nineteen seventy-four brought George Smiley in John LeCarre's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, which shifted the genre from hyper-masculine fantasy to well-written, complex plots and a healthy dose of realism about the Cold War.    Then, in 1984, Tom Clancy published The Hunt for Red October. Playing on American fears of the Reagan-era arms race, Clancy nevertheless ushered in the spy novel of the 21st century. Blacks, women, the disabled, and immigrants now play heroic roles (granted, still without any nuance or subtlety) and the technology is updated for modern verisimilitude.    In true postmodern fashion, Forrest DeVoe, Jr. takes what he likes and leaves the rest. Jack Mallory is macho, but he's not a pig about it, even forcing himself to admit to Laura's superior talents in hand-to-hand combat. Into the Volcano mixes the assassination thriller with the Cold War setting of the defection thriller and the traitorship of the mob hunt.    The book's saving grace is decent writing that doesn't have its eyes on the big screen. In the era of Dan Brown and Harlan Coben, whose books read like badly-written screenplays, DeVoe spares us the characters who have ridiculously mundane and pathetically humorous one-liners running through their heads in the midst of a crisis.    Into the Volcano is fairly lukewarm and forgettable, but, for fans of the genre, it's a fun romp through the history of the spy novel.	2004-12-06

Be it the Garden of Eden or Thomas More's Utopia, the idea of a safe, sane, and just world has always captured the human imagination and striving for it has shaped human endeavor. <br /> <br />Esi Edugyan's debut novel, The Second Life of Samuel Tyne (HarperCollins, anticipated publication 2004), chronicles one man's pursuit of his personal heaven. Fifteen years after his immigration from West Africa to Canada, Samuel Tyne is stagnating in a dead-end government job and foundering as a husband and father. When he inherits his uncle's Alberta mansion in the town of Aster, he moves there over the protests of his wife and twin daughters. Settled by former American slaves who fled to Canada, the once all-black Aster is fabled to be the place of second chances. But the Tynes encounter a much different reality. A mysterious arsonist is terrorizing the town and, as Samuel's daughters become increasingly unstable and aggressive, the hostile eyes of Aster all turn towards the Tynes. <br /> <br />For a first novel, penned at the age of 25, Edugyan's work is impressive, exploring as it does our deepest desires for community and a chance to fulfill our truest dreams. With an elegance unexpected in an artist so young, the author plumbs the tragedy of a paradise just shy of fulfillment and ponders whether our actions create our nature or if our nature determines our actions. <br /> <br />In many ways, Samuel's story is a brilliant vehicle for these questions. To have imagined a utopia unrealized may be worse the inability to imagine it at all. Edugyan seems, almost inadvertently, to have tapped into the idea that the capacity for such fantasy is the source of human misery and madness. However, at times, she skims the deeper issues like a flat stone skipping across the surface of a pond, as though she doesn't trust her own instinct to let the story take her where she wants to go. <br /> <br />Edugyan's style is hypnotic and mythical, reminiscent in some ways of Steinbeck in her striving for a sweeping human fairy tale. The drawback is characters that are often shallow and lacking specificity. The outlines are there and quite compelling, but the details which would allow us to access the soul of the Tyne family and the people of Aster are missing. <br /> <br />As a result, the tragedy of the novel is almost farcical in proportion. As their lives unravel, the novel's tone takes on a futility that surpasses the capriciousness of life itself and devolves into random, even pointless, destruction that fails to be moving precisely because the characters themselves are inaccessible. The Tynes' world doesn't just fall apart; it collapses in on itself to the point of silliness. <br /> <br />Still, like much debut work from fledgling artists who have the chops to become important novelists, Edugyan's first title is worth a read. Despite its flaws, it's an engaging and solidly-written tale from a fresh new Canadian voice.	2004-12-05
US	17087465	R1H8NNBPQC30YY	0670032131	987829512	The Quality of Life Report	Books	5	5	7	N	N	What Really Matters	Lucinda Trout calls her latest assignment \\"A Year in Provence meets Lake Wobegon Days\\". Her acerbic, gramatically-challenged boss calls it \\"Girl, Interrupted meets Deliverance\\". I'd say Meghan Daum's novel, The Quality of Life Report (Penguin Books, 2003) is Billie Letts channeling the spirit of Drew Barrymore in Never Been Kissed. <br /> <br />At 29, Lucinda Trout is trying to live the hip life in the fast pace of New York City. Her life (as it were) consists of a tiny, rat-infested, over-priced apartment, a maddening boss, a cadre of shallow friends, and minor celebrity status as the lifestyle correspondent for a local talk show. Tired of reporting on thong underwear and yogurt, Lucinda jumps at her boss' offer to send her on assignment, reporting on methamphetamine addiction in the small Midwestern town of Prairie City. <br /> <br />In Prairie City, Lucinda finds a beautiful simplicity she hadn't thought possible. With visions of Sam Shepard dancing in her head, she relocates to Prairie City to produce \\"The Quality of Life Reports\\" - talk show segments designed to sell New Yorkers a first-hand glimpse at life in the provinces. <br /> <br />But life in Prairie City doesn't turn out to be as simple as it looks. Armed with only an idealized image of the community she has come to exploit, Lucinda falls for (and moves into a barn with) a local man, Mason Clay. Life begins to unravel as Lucinda contends with Mason's children, farm life, the harsh prairie winter, and finally the darker secrets that are driving Mason's life. In doing so, she confronts her own fantasies about \\"the quality of life\\" and comes to a more mature understanding of what's truly important. <br /> <br />The novel bears an unmistakable resemblance to the author's own life. Once a reporter for The New Yorker, Meghan Daum picked up and moved to Nebraska (while Prairie City is never placed in a particular state in the text, the description certainly matches Nebraska closely). Living in a small farmhouse on the prairie, listening to the shrieking wind that once caused \\"prairie madness\\" during the westward emigration of the 19th century, Daum conceived Lucinda as a means of exploring our American identity in the geographical search for the good life. <br /> <br />Without an author who understands and deeply loves Midwestern culture, this novel would have been an insulting, chick-lit failure. But Daum knows the Heartland well enough to pick on its quirks with the affection of a sibling, not the mockery of an outsider. This allows her to often be piercingly funny without demeaning nor lionizing the lives of her characters. In turn, her humor brings a tone of mirth to Lucinda's story that keeps Daum always above sentimentality and emotional manipulation of the reader. Even during the book's most serious moments, Daum maintains the elegance of perspective. She is compassionate with her characters, even as they fail, pick themselves up and stumble on, only to fail again later. They are quirky without losing humanity; funny without being affectedly sassy. <br /> <br />For this, we can forgive even Daum's most biting wit, the clearest example of which is her portrayal of Prairie City's women's book club. With her compassionate eye for the absurd, Daum takes on the middle-class fad of book discussion groups by sending Lucinda into this impassioned bunch who are reading and discussing the typical sort of book club fare - badly-written, pretentious fiction that takes itself way too seriously. Of course, this is just the sort of book Daum has written and, for this, we can love her all the more. Her taste for the ironic doesn't even pass over herself. Quips Lucinda's boss regarding book clubs: \\"They're so low-brow, they're unibrow.\\" Perhaps the turn of the 21st century will be known for satire that, first and foremost, satirizes itself (The Simpsons and South Park are two obvious examples). If so, Daum is riding the crest of the wave, complete with a book group discussion guide in the back. <br /> <br />Yet, in spite of it all, Lucinda fumbles towards the discovery of what's really important in life. And, true to both real life and Daum's style, her epiphanies come with a whisper, not a bang. Lucinda realizes it is she, not the people of Prairie City, who are backwards and provincial. Her fascination with the town was, all along, her fascination with the supposed glamor of country living and the folksy charm of the townspeople which she tries desperately to hang onto and portray in her Quality of Life Reports, even as the evidence for her fantasy dwindles. Her maturity comes with love of place, which comes with honesty - Prairie City is not Jan Karon's Mitford, but neither is it Harmonie Korine's Manhattan (which gets an honorable mention in the novel as \\"about as organic as a John Bonham drum solo at the Ice Capades\\"). Discovering what's truly important comes with mirth, compassion, irony, and an acceptance that the truth is probably somewhere in the murky middle.	2004-12-03
US	17087465	R2EAM8TQRT9SG3	0007154607	133639227	Colors Insulting to Nature: A Novel	Books	5	8	10	N	N	The Snake's Tail	The snake has at last swallowed its own tail and postmodern fiction has found a defining moment. Literature found postmodernism in 1961 with Thomas Pynchon's novel, V, and is characterized by an indistinction between high and low art, parody and irony, celebration of ambiguity, regurgitation and assimilation of previously original work, a preoccupation with the organization of knowledge (not what you know, but how you know it), and a rebellion against consumer capitalism. As such, Cintra Wilson's novel, Colors Insulting to Nature (HarperCollins 2004), serves as a sort of meta-postmodern fiction. <br /> <br />From the moment 10-year-old Liza Normal is awestruck by the movie Ice Castles, she dreams of the glory of stardom. Unfortunately, Liza is not the sort of girl who becomes famous. Vulgar in both looks and personality, Liza is saddles with a maniacally ambitious stage mother and devoid of any marketable talent. Propelled through her mother's bizarre homegrown performing arts boot camp, her stage debut in The Sound of Music is an unqualified disaster that serves only to label Liza a freak at her suburban San Francisco high school. But Liza has one talent of which she is not aware - an indomitable ability to bounce back fighting from any setback or humiliation no matter how devastating by sheer force of will. Through failed love affairs, drug experimentation, New Age religious adventures, and searing rejection, Liza finally discovers that she is a much stronger and better person than the starlet she thought she wanted to be. <br /> <br />Colors Insulting to Nature is easily one of the funniest black comedies of the last decade. The entire price of the book in hardcover is alone worth the deconstruction of the 1978 smarm-fest that was Ice Castles (Columbia TriStar Pictures). I challenge anyone to get through Liza's trials at her mother's summer theatre camp without laughing hard enough to wet themselves. The camp's delightfully bizarre production of The Sound of Music is Barbara Robinson's The Best Christmas Pageant Ever (HarperCollins 1972) for grown-ups. <br /> <br />Wilson's novel is certainly metafiction. Self-conscious narrative interruptions point out the reader's expectation of particular plot devices. Wilson uses this brilliantly to mock the very same tortured tango that she herself is dancing. Liza story contains subtlely hideous intimations of modern Hollywood's best-known templates - not just Ice Castles, but Carrie (by Stephen King, published by Random House in 1974 and adapted for film in 1976 by Lawrence D. Cohen), Pretty Woman (Touchstone Pictures 1989), and The Wizard of Oz (by L. Frank Baum, self-published in 1900 and adapted for film in 1939 by MGM Studios), among others. <br /> <br />Despite Wilson's unapologetic inflations of reality, Liza is an utterly human, sympathetic, and believable character. Her indestructibility masks such a completely credible vulnerability that it's impossible for anyone with a heart not to have it break for her even as we're gasping with laughter at her irreverently contrived escapades. <br /> <br />Wilson uses Liza's story to ingeniously illustrate the uniquely postmodern insanity of personalities sewn together like Frankenstein from Hollywood prototypes, all stemming from a neurotic black hole where one's sense of self ought to be. Our media-saturated culture has fed us on these prototypes with an unrealistic vision of what life and love should look like. Wilson's novel posits that the source of our Western existential crisis is the resulting void of self-awareness when we swallow the big screen's lessons uncritically. As such, Liza's life serves as a recapitulation of the entire modern search for meaning - fame, love, sex, drugs, psychotherapy, consumerism, and marketable fad religions like Wicca and born-again Christianity. <br /> <br />Colors Insulting to Nature is not for the faint of heart, but is unspeakably worth the ride. If I could give this book more than five stars,I would.	2004-12-02

Then her next book or essay is released and I am reminded all over again of the reasons her philosophy grounds me in the profoundly sane dream of a better future. <br /> <br />Her most recent book, The Earth Path: Grounding Your Spirit in the Rhythms of Nature (HarperSanFrancisco, 2004) serves as a guide to developing awareness of the most basic (and, as such, perhaps most elusive) elements of the natural world. Retreating somewhat from the frenetic pace of the streets in Webs of Power: Notes from the Global Uprising (New Society Publishers, 2002), The Earth Path takes us to Starhawk's home in the Cazadero Hills and through a journey of observing earth, air, fire, water, and spirit - the elements that sustain all life. <br /> <br />The opening chapter uses the fairy tale of the Isle of Birds to illustrate the author's desired outcome for this journey. In the story, a king sends his beloved son to learn the language of birds. After 21 years, the prince learns to hear, to understand, and to respond. For some inexplicable reason, this angers the king (perhaps he expected his son to learn marksmanship?), but the moral of the tale (and subsequently the entire book) is the importance of deep awareness and the simple fact that such awareness requires time and attention. <br /> <br />In addition to the author's stated intentions, The Earth Path serves as a wake-up call to Pagans that our spirituality involves a tangible and intimate relationship with nature, not just a theoretical acknowledgment of it. The book gently chastises Pagans who have allowed their relationship with the earth to slip into the abstract - perhaps for fear of getting cold, dirtying ritual garb, encountering insects, or simply because our culture places very little value on activities that foster deep awareness. As a result, few Pagans have \\"time spent talking to trees\\" penciled into our day planners. A tragedy for us as well as the trees! Indeed, Starhawk takes the whole culture to task perhaps more for keeping us so ignorant of the ecological processes on which our lives depend. As she notes, it's entirely possible (even common) to be educated all the way to a doctorate level with no more than a 4th-grade understanding of photosynthesis and often no education at all as to how our local ecologies sustain themselves nor how our communities can sustain themselves without interrupting this ecological self-regulation. <br /> <br />Readers who have followed Starhawk since she first published her best-known work, The Spiral Dance (Harper and Row, 1979), will delight in watching her evolve in her spirituality and its application. Throughout what has become a veritable canon, we watch her grow from an idealistic girl to a mature woman whose strength and wisdom has only aggregated over the years. The Earth Path will not disappoint her fans and students. It remains as accessible and unpretentious as her previous writing, with the honesty and emotional vulnerability that has always left her readers feeling we know her. Of course, it also includes the insightful, ironic, and sometimes piercing wit for which she is known and loved. Do not ever pick up a Starhawk book if you expect to come away smugly comforted in your personal righteousness! While her ideas indeed comfort and ground, they do not bolster an I'm-ok-you're-ok placidity. She relentlessly challenges our imaginations to stretch upward and outward. <br /> <br />In fact, her latest book contends that constriction of the imagination shapes our perception and awareness. For illustration, Starhawk tells the story of the 2003 Sacramento protests against biotech and industrial agriculture when police confiscated buckets of seedballs, believing them to be projectile weapons. The irony of the situation is both humorous and sad, but well exemplifies the principle that what a person is able to imagine creates categories for making sense of the world - the broader one's imagination grows, the greater variety of things that will make sense. In the rigidly-controlling hierarchies of our culture (such as law enforcement), where constriction of the imagination facilitates predictability of behavior and uniformity of obedience to command, a greater number of things become nonsense and likely to engender fear before understanding. <br /> <br />One key to expanding the imagination is, according to Starhawk, ceasing to care what others think, creating a space with the freedom to think about anything at all. As Pagans, we are in a privileged position to do this since we already exist on the fringes of the \\"respectable\\" institutions of Western society, such as academia. <br /> <br />I found myself both disagreeing and feeling challenged by this idea. On the one hand, many Pagans have worked hard to bring earth-based religion under the umbrella of \\"respectability\\" - establishing Pagan traditions as legally-recognized churches, securing seats on various ecumenical councils, organizing Pagans in military and police ranks, educating the courts, employers, and general public as to the relatively \\"normal\\" lives of most Pagans, right down to changing the dictionary definition of the word \\"witch\\". Cultural behemoths, like academia, are, indeed, slow to change. But they do change and I don't believe we're as far removed from academic respectability as Starhawk suggests, especially considering that many of today's Pagan leaders are highly educated. I see academia as similar to the places Starhawk talks about where two ecosystems meet and their diversity creates a mutual benefit and richness for both. <br /> <br />On the other hand, this question of respectability is a good reminder not to compromise what sets us apart from our predominantly alienating and exploitative culture. Religious movements tend to start out loosely organized, culturally marginalized, and socially radical. As they gain numbers, prominence, and respectability, a vicious circle of compromise to gain acceptance is set into motion (usually with a hard lurch to the political right; the Mormons are America's most recent example of this phenomenon). Starhawk's words challenge us not to compromise our values or who we are for public acceptance. <br /> <br />Overall, The Earth Path gives us a practical ethos of questioning how any given action will impact the whole, using deep attention to each element as a guide. Interwoven with this ethical paradigm are some treats new to Starhawk's readers. The text includes the clearest explanation of grounding and anchoring I've ever heard. The author's courage in defending meat-eating (is there a hotter topic anywhere in Pagandom?) is testament to her honest and principled character - the reader may not agree with her, but after taking such a risk, it's impossible not to trust her. Each chapter tackling an element provides useful metaphors for translating that element's nature into principles that guide our lives. For example, Air can teach us how to transform force rather than wall it off or be blown about by it. Fire is a metaphor for manifesting will from a small group of enthusiasts all the way up to the transformation of larger structures. Each chapter includes delightful lessons in permaculture that tantalize the reader to learn more. Starhawk's theory of Gaian Evolution, outlined in Chapter Four, has the potential to change our existing paradigms with the same explosive force as Charles Darwin. <br /> <br />At times, the book's intended audience is a bit unclear. Much of the language and ideas seem aimed for the Pagan community. Even as early as The Spiral Dance and Truth or Dare (HarperSanFrancisco, 1988), Starhawk was moving beyond the boilerplate, Paganism 101 fare of much of Pagan literature, filling a void for Pagans who had long ago learned to cast circles and needed weightier ideas to sink their teeth into. However, at other times, the text slips into explanations of the simplest Pagan history and theology. I found the history of the witch burnings a bit incongruent and a subject that has simply been done to death, with conflicting data, in practically every Pagan book ever published. Similarly, the basic explanation of the Sabbats is probably redundant for most readers and, for anyone needing that basic information, the rest of the book will likely be confusing. <br /> <br />In the end though, such minutiae is inconsequential. This is easily the best non-fiction I've read in 2004 and I encourage readers to find their favorite outdoor spot to curl up with The Earth Path and allow it to open their attention to the life cycle around us that is so important and so pervasive that it is too easily forgotten. For those returning to Starhawk's work, The Earth Path will be a welcome addition to their collection. For those who have not yet had the pleasure, I encourage you to run, not walk, to introduce yourselves to the challenging work of one of the most important philosophers of our time.	2004-12-01
