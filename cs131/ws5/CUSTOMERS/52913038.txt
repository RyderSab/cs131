And just when you think things can't get any worse, they do.<br /><br />Smithison Ide is a 40 something year old 'guy next door' who unfortunately through a series of events over the past few decades has let life slip him by and he just watched from the sidelines.  Now overweight, chain smoker, alcoholic, dead-end job, and alone Smithy comes to the realization he has nothing left to lose, except some of his older memories when life was a tad bit better.  If only he could have made some other decisions, maybe things would have turned out differently.<br /><br />With that in mind, he discovers his old Raleigh bicycle left in his parents garage, and with knowledge of his sisters body in Los Angeles he begins a crusade across America leaving his current life behind.<br /><br />It's a fabulous story of transformation.  Smithy literally pedals his way from Rhode Island to California, and the cast of characters he meets along the way show that even through tragedy there is compassion.  Slowly, Smithy finds that alcohol and cigarettes aren't the only consumables in his life, and that the people he meets have parallel backgrounds as himself.<br /><br />The chapters are often short, ranging from 2 to 10 pages each and alternate between his present day quest and flashbacks of defining moments throughout his life.  In these series of flashbacks, the family and history of Smithison Ide and his family are revealed.  You begin to understand him and his family on a deeper level, and reveals so much more as to why Smithy rides across country.<br /><br />His physical, spiritual, and mental transformations have much meaning and as the reader you root for him, care for him, feel sorry for him, and find yourself wanting to support him.  Very well written and tugs at the readers various emotions: humorous, empathy, love, excitement, and more.<br /><br />Does he find what he's looking for when he finally get to California?  Yes and no, and much, much more.  I think all of us can find a little bit of Smithison Ide in each of us, and wish we can transform parts of ourselves as well.<br /><br />A fine novel, and my only regret is that it wasn't longer.motions: humorous, empathy, love, excitement, and more. <br /> <br />Does he find what he's looking for when he finally get to California?

As a huge Star Wars fan who has read the majority of all the 'adult' novels written by various authors that covered the different time frames within the Star Wars universe, I was somewhat disappointed with Survivor's Quest.<br /><br />What makes it even harder for me to be critical is the fact I think Timothy Zahn has produced some fine material for the Star Wars universe.  However, Survivor's Quest felt like it was rushed together just to produce another SW novel, and many of the plot lines were generic Sci-Fi scenarios just cobbled together once again only this time starring Luke and Mara.<br /><br />There were few original thoughts that carried this story through to the end which a reader hasn't seen in various other popular Sci-Fi movies.  The main characters come across a convenient and coincidental invitation to help locate a once lost roving colony that may hold secrets and history of the Old Republic.  Of course the ship was lost near Chiss territory, so enter the obligatory 'distrustful but need as an ally' alien race to help retrieve the long lost derelict ship.  But someone tried to sabotage the flight towards their mission.  Now introduce yet another distrustful ally in the form of an elite Stormtrooper squad and you have a triangle of trust/distrust.<br /><br />Upon reaching the colony of 'Outbound Flight', the ship is quiet, almost too quiet so of course there are survivors living aboard who harbor their own secret....a fear of Jedi...and other things they are hiding...clich&eacute;.<br /><br />As one ally reveals their true colors, it's up to Mara and Luke to save the day all by themselves in a very McGyver/James Bond sort of way.  And when the main villian escapes, only Luke and Mara who have had no rest and escaped doom a dozen times end up in such a predictable and linear climax you can see it three chapters away.<br /><br />While indeed the story was pretty predictable, the dialogue and retrospective thoughts of both Luke and Mara, their past, and their over-dependence on the Force made my eyes roll.  For some reason I just felt that author Zahn just couldn't capture the essence of Luke or Mara in this novel.  I couldn't see them doing or saying the things they did, and the ending was so anti-climatic I had this last lingering thought:<br /><br />The book was total filler material.  Even if the main plot was pulled off by the villain, what impact would it have on the SW universe overall?  Probably none.  The way it was explained, or maybe the way I interpreted it, I thought \\"So what?  What does any of this do to the New Republic, the Imperial Remnant, the New Jedi Order?\\"  I couldn't think of anything.st, and their over-dependence on the Force made my eyes roll.

I received this book as a gift from someone who new I enjoyed the television show Dallas, and I can really say it was a treat.<br /><br />I must say that Mr. Hagman had a very interesting life that goes way beyond what we know him best for: playing the merciless J.R. Ewing on Dallas and his other hit I Dream of Jennie.<br /><br />From the get go, Larry speaks about his youth, being the son to Broadway star Mary Martin (famous for being Peter Pan), his father and tenuous relationship with his step-father Richard.<br /><br />The book reads in a chronological order from boyhood, through his stint in the military (where he met his one and only wife Maj), to his first movie roles, through his television career and wraps up with his last series 'Orleans' and his liver transplant.<br /><br />He has many stories which are entertaining and fun reads.  So fun in fact I wanted more and was disapointed only in the fact they weren't long enough or more of them.  Mr. Hagman had some fascinating quips and stories regarding such people at Burgess Meredith, Carol O'Conner, and other tv and silver screen legends.<br /><br />But not everything was picture perfect....There were times of poverty, illicit drug use, and confronts his drinking issues which led to his liver transplant head on.<br /><br />I was amazed at what a world traveler he was, even before his most memorable character of playing oil tycoon J.R. Ewing.  He had seen more of the world before his 20th birthday than most people do their whole lives, and many times early in his youth, he did it with no job or no money, but always had a positive outlook on life.<br /><br />A very inspirational autobiography where Larry does show you the silver lining on all dark clouds.<br /><br />Again, for me the trouble with this book was it just seemed to short....I would have loved to read many more of his 'tall, but true' tales, many of them with a martini or bottle of champagne in his hand.	2005-03-14

I was very pleasantly surprised with this Clone Wars installment and was a very fresh breath after the daunting and sometimes lack luster New Jedi Order series.<br /><br />First, the most noticeable difference, and probably the most positive one is a cast of virtually all new characters.  These characters who form the basis of a MASH unit on some war-torn back water planet are very diverse (not just by species) and easily accessible and likeable.  You have your two star doctors, a head nurse, a Hutt for a supply agent, A Sullustian for a wartime journalist, a smart-ass droid, and a Jedi healer who round out the first tier of characters.  In this swamp like environment of the far reaches of the battlefront, not only do they fight to save and repair the lives of clone soldiers for the Republic, they also learn more about life itself.  The questions become deeper as they come to cope with such questions: Can one fall in love in a war?  Can clones really be viewed as individuals and be unique?  Are droids more than the sum of their parts?  They are faced with real life and death questions I think we can all identify with.<br /><br />The second tier of characters includes a Republic hero, or is he really a cold blooded mercenary?  A corrupt Republic Admiral who may not just have his own agenda.  Agents of Black Sun using the battle torn landscape as a staging ground for drug (Bota) smuggling.<br /><br />Both authors did a superb job in equally pacing out the action between all the characters, and it really seemed to me as one of the most realistic Star Wars novel yet.  All the basic themes are there, with great characters.  To identify one overall plotline was difficult, but like an episode of the TV show MASH, there were many different subplots that carried a wonderful story and the reader really won't notice otherwise.<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to the sequel, and can only hope future Star Wars novels can deviate from the traditional re-hashed characters.  It's a big universe out there....explore it!ters.  It's a big universe out there....explore it! <br />	2004-11-04

But this time it's not a well known target, and not achieved through dramatic or expected means.  The terrorists have teamed up with the drug lords of South America in a \\"I'll scratch your back, if you'll scratch mine\\" plot to strike at the American people where both partners can realize the fruits of each others labors.<br /><br />Taking advantage of our lax southern borders with Mexico, a covert team of middle eastern terrorists are supplied with weapons and means of infiltration through tried and true drug trafficking chains overseen by the Columbians.<br /><br />Once here on American soil, they strike yet again in a heinous fashion showing that no American is safe, not even those is small rural cities.<br /><br />Enter Jack Ryan Jr., a hot track financial analyst who using his mind and black 'agency' resources at his side able to track suspicious financial transactions that may be tied to the recent terrorist attack and just who the 'players' are.  Also Jack's two cousins are recruited by the 'agency' as well as field agents who must administer swift and deniable justice.<br /><br />Overall the book sets up a very convincing scenario and the means to track and follow and identify the bad guys is very interesting but not too technical.<br /><br />The book was shorter than Clancy's other novels and the climax was very late and very short.  This coupled with the fact that everyone is cousins and everything just happens to fall into place at the end may be a somewhat of a stretch, but begs for more.<br /><br />How so?  Well, I think this book is only half a book as that the South American drug lords are never seen or heard from again after the initial chapters and key in the overall plot development.  It appears that since the book was short and the climax was compacted, that there is possibly a second sequel on the fast track right behind this one that will see our agents make the Columbian connection.  The reader can only hope so, for I felt somewhat cheated and let down that so many threads were opened up and never addressed.<br /><br />I expected more from Tom Clancy./>How so?

All of his plots are fresh, and never the same recycled space opera ideas we've read so many time before.  But where Mr. David really shines is in his character development.<br />After reading only a few of his novels, you feel as if you really know the characters on a personal basis in his corner of the ST universe, and 'Stone &amp; Anvil' is no exception.<br />The overall theme of the book, which may not be apparent at first is the deeper origin of Capt. Mackenzie Calhoun.  Think of this novel as Calhoun: Year One.  We get to see Mac's first days in the academy, more on his home planet, how he first met 'Eppie', and how he became the new James T. Kirk of his era.<br />However, all this back-story feeds into the more crucial, upfront story: the murder of shipmate Gleau as was the cliffhanger in the previous novel.  Is Ensign Janos involved?  As the murder mystery unravels, as is so with any Peter David novel, all is not what it seems, and there are some very original plot twists that will have ST fans ecstatic at past references.<br />The only issue I had with this novel, and I can understand the method in which it was used, was that every other chapter bounced between 'Now' &amp; 'Then'.  Meaning, chapter one takes place in the present Next Generation timeline, while chapter 2 find a young Calhoun entering Starfleet Academy.  And thus for the remaining of the book the reader must shift gears between past and present.<br />Why this was a hardcover, and not a soft, I don't understand.  While a good book, there was no 'earth-shattering' events that are usually reserved for hard covers.  And I seemed to have missed any cliffhanger.  I guess the next novel will start a new storyline altogether, something that seems out of place for a Peter David ST novel.	2004-06-15

First a seemingly random, yet planned murder of a gay attorney in town has the community and the police baffled.  As the story progresses and the body count increases, it soon becomes evident that the murderer is singling out and sending a very private yet cryptic message to Kerney.<br />Kerney then realizes that his pregnant wife, and his estranged son may also be targets, and the clues are vague at best.  This is no ordinary killer, this one has spent a lot of time crafting his trade and will have the reader guessing for quite sometime on who's next and where we are going.<br />That's the testament to this novel.  You can really empathize with Kerney as he begins to feel helpless for not only himself but those few remaining close to him.  The novel does a great job in pacing the action and guesswork, and you'd be surprised how fluid it moves along, all the while the bodies start stacking up.<br />The only issue I had that prevented me from assigning 5 stars was the very last chapter.  After the climax, which was a little short after such a wonderful buildup, the last chapter jumped the reader a few weeks forward and everything was back to normal...too quickly and done within only a few brief pages.	2004-05-26

As both authors have taken us on a fictional/non-fictional journey for the past few years that has now spanned 11 books, there was sure to be some slow moments and some harrowing moments that would keep the reader turning pages.<br />Often I though a few of the books were a bit too long, and maybe a couple in the series could have been consolidated to make for a more flowing and cohesive arc.<br />I happy to report that 'Armageddon' delivers very strong story content, much more action and pacing, and quite a few character surprises that leads to the final chapter: Glorious Appearing.<br />It seems that the 7 year tribulation is almost over.  With less than a year left to the prophesized return of Jesus, the world has pretty much chosen sides, albeit there are some dissidents that have that one last chance who have yet to take the mark of Carpathia (the antichrist), or accepts the messiah.  Leading up to the battle of all battles, Carpathia's iron fist begins to be more prominent....accept his mark, or die.  As the beheadings pick up pace, the Lord also quickens his judgments and the world is faced with a few more 'natural' dilemma's.<br />Armageddon picks up pace, and soon the reader is moved ahead 3 months where some of the characters we have come to enjoy meet their fate, often with dire consequences.  Some of the majors will not make it all the way to the end.<br />In a chilling moment within the book, Carpathia summons his 10 regional leaders to discuss upcoming battle plans against the rebels.  Carpathia finally reveals to them his true nature and his true intent in a very descriptive manner on how he wasn't the 'only' angel around when he became conscious and describes his interactions with the one who calls himself God and his son Jesus, and how they had met once before and have been locked in a struggle for millennia.  Carpathia finishes his 'pep-talk' with some supernatural acts, and its surprising how his followers react and respond.<br />The book closes as a cliffhanger as the reader once again is moved forward in time:  Carpathia and his forces, an army unlike the world has ever seen before, are at the doors of the Holy City and that of the rebellion stronghold of Petra.  Here the remaining undecided world dissidents must make their final choice, as it is only hours away from when Jesus is prophesized to return and deal with Carpathia in the ultimate battle.s a cliffhanger as the reader once again is moved forward in time:  Carpathia and his forces, an army unlike the world has ever seen before, are at the doors of the Holy City and that of the rebellion stronghold of Petra.

The Beings are god like creatures whom ancient humans wrote about as Apollo, Zues, and the like from different human mythologies.<br />The prequel to Gods Above, had The Beings once again bring their drug-like substance known as `ambrosia' to the people of Danter with promises of enlightenment and prosperity in exchange for worship.<br />But Capt. Calhoun of the Excalibur and wife, Capt. Shelby of the Trident know better.  Calhoun's ship suffered greatly from the powers of The Beings when he challenged their power, in order to save the misguided Danteri people.  Even Ambassador Si Cwan and sister Kalinda seemed to be at the mercy of the gods in the form of Anubis, Egyptian god of death.<br />With both crews of the Trident an Excalibur trying to devise a way to stop the rampant spread of ambrosia and influence of The Beings, other sub-plots introduced continue:<br />Mark McHenry who `died' at the hand of Artemis, may not be dead at all even though his corpse resides in sickbay.<br />Kebron continues his hide shedding and metamorphosis and the results are unexpected.<br />Calhoun's adoptive son, Moke, learns something new about himself and surprises all.<br />Soleta is tempted by the god of truth, Thoth, and even this Vulcan `logic' comes in question.<br />A really interesting development with Robin's mother, Morgan Primus comes to light.<br />A classic Star Trek Icon stops in for a visit.<br />And many more developments to keep the reader entertained.  To me, it is amazing on how easy author Peter David can keep the reader energized and continually surprised with all the different plots.  The New Frontier easily and continuously fleshes out its characters to keep them fresh and up to date.  More so, the New Frontier series really is the more exciting of all the Star Trek series.  Think of the crew of the Trident and Excalibur as a combination of a sorority/fraternity life, seedy soap opera, and a dark comedy all rolled into one continuous space faring jaunt.<br />And as always, just when you think things are wrapped up, in classic Peter David style, he leaves the reader with a jaw dropping cliff hanger.nd continuously fleshes out its characters to keep them fresh and up to date.

After the mediocre reception and drawn out plotlines of books 15, 16, 17, finally author Greg Keyes puts some sparks back into the The New Jedi Order and builds a well paced and action packed story that genuinely keeps the readers attention.<br />With Sekot finally found and Tahiri finally becoming whole again, Keyes brings back the idea that a war is actually going on, and certain characters actions play defining moments in the setting of the future of the Star Wars Universe.<br />There are two main plotlines here in The Final Prophecy and they play out very well:<br />1) Master Shaper Nen Yim, Priest Harrar and Prophet Nom Anor devise a plan to secret themselves off Yuuzhan'tar (formerly Coruscant) with the aid of Jedi's Corran Horn and Tahiri Vella in a stolen Sekotian ship.  However, everyone of them has their own motives and the three Vong clearly do not trust each other leaving Horn and Vella to constantly watch their own backs and form alliances with their foes if they are to survive.  Once they all set foot upon Sekot, the Vong show their true colors and the reader will be surprised by revelation by Harrar and Nen Yim, who also suprise themselves.  Nen Yim also takes it a step further by yet again revealing something new to Tahiri which makes her question her own being once again.  Not to be outdone in crafty plots, Nom Anor makes his move who proves fatal for one character and jeopardizes the well being of Sekot itself.<br />The other main thrust of the novel see the Vong develop a new weapon which has taken out the communications network of the Galactic Alliance as General Wedge Antilles develops a strategy to retake the planet Bilbringi.  What Antilles has in mind with the aide of the Imperial Remnant and General Garm Bel Iblis quickly falls apart as communication blackouts sweep the galaxy.  As sitting ducks, Antilles must fight a decisive battle and get reinforcements as soon as possible.  Enter Jaina Solo who discovers a once hidden battle station being abducted by pirates, and Jag Fel who must also find reinforcements.<br />With Han &amp; Leia Solo piloting the Falcon, the reader can once again enjoy a fast paced and easy to follow action page turner as events around the galaxy come to a forefront on both Sekot and the battle of Bilbringi.<br />Yes, there are many characters missing, but unlike other novels in this long series, they aren't missed too much because of the action and logical forward movement of the big picture.

It's kinda hard to review a book that has no plot per se, but more of an explanation on the theories of space, time travel, our universe and its creation and demise, and of course black holes.<br />What is really nice about this relatively short scientific book, is that Stephen Hawking makes his research and theories very accessible to the everyday reader.  His explanations are not overly complex and deep that it leaves you with a headache afterwards.  In other words, you need not be a rocket scientist or have and alphabet soup degrees to catch on.<br />Mr. Hawking keeps his chapters relatively short and not mired into too much techno-babble, but gets straight to the meat of any said topic and presents wonderful layman analogies that we can all identify with.  It's also pleasant that he interjects a certain degree of wit and self humor into his style so as he doesn't come across as a stiff scientist.<br />The book ends with a transcript of a wonderful radio interview he did when he was 50, which surprisingly depicts a very human side to Mr. Hawking while still presenting his thoughts on creation, God, dark matter, time travel, and what exactly 'may' happen if one were sucked into a black hole.	2003-10-06

The novel starts with a preface regarding missing royalties to the Indian Nations as it ties into oil profits and the U.S. government.  While I don't dispute his claims one way or another, Sinister Pig clearly is a vehicle for Hillerman to present his personal viewpoints in a fictional manner and to make the reader really aware of this.<br />The story itself, while good, is missing the magical sense of Navajo country and traditions the readers have come to expect from Hillerman.  Gone are the beautiful descriptions of the four corners area, and the deep culture of the Native Americans.  Instead we find Jim Chee at a mid life crisis, contemplating his life as a bachelor and his love for former Officer Bernie Manuelito.<br />Joe Leaphorn is present as well, but his character steps down as a main player to that of the supporting cast.  And while Leaphorn has his momentous 'breakthrough' in the case, his involvement otherwise is minimal.<br />However, who does step up to the plate is Bernie Manuelito.  Now as a Border Patrol Officer assigned to lower New Mexico, she stumbles across a corrupt department, and some 'fishy' on-goings at the nearby Tuttle Ranch.  Something in regards to drugs, gas and oil pipelines, illegal immigration, the apparent murders of undercover government officials and of course and errant and deviant U.S. government.<br />The novel is pretty fast paced and is a very quick read.  Chapters are small and to the point.  It was a good diversion for a Hillerman book, but I hope this was just a half way point to a much larger novel that will bring our characters back to the forefront of Native American culture and its roots in northern New Mexico.at will bring our characters back to the forefront of Native American culture and its roots in northern New Mexico.	2003-09-23

The 'Force Heretic' story arc concludes with this third installment (or book 17) of the New Jedi Order series which has spanned the last few years, and thank God.<br />Heretic I &amp; II seemed like complete filler material to me, doing little to advance the overall grand storyline that the New Jedi Order had set in motion.  They did introduce a few marginally interesting points, but due to teh fact they were so drawn out, verbose, with little payoff it was a struggle to read through those.  However, Heretic III was far superior to its prequels.<br />We finally see the resolution of Tahiri, the young Jedi girl who was saved by Anakin (who she was smitten with) from horrible experiments the Vong had dealt to her when she was in captivity.  Finally, her bipolar personality story point comes to a head.<br />We also witness the 1st major campaign with the allied New Galactic Alliance (formerly The New Republic) and the Imperial Remnant.  This makes for an exciting dynamic, and the ensuing space battle is one of the best to be read after many books.<br />Luke, Mara, Jacen, Danni, Saba finally see their quest for the search of the living planet, Sekot, also come to a head.  Here the authors really make up for a campy and wild story regarding Sekot to the point where it actually can be read as plausible.  Sekot hold some deep secrets regarding the Jedi, the Vong, and itself and its place in the galaxy.  While some questions are answered, others are introduced in a exciting way which really helps make up for the previous two books attempts for the reader to care about finding Sekot.<br />And within the pages concerning the Vong, as always, Nom Anor's character shines.  Nom's character makes the whole trilogy bright spot as his scheming and malicious ways make for great reads.  Especially the attempt on his life from one of his own, and the revealing of one of his spies to Shmirra.

Taking place just a few short months after the Color of Law, Kerney is just settling into his new role as police chief, when of course an old case resurfaces back to the forefront.<br />It seems that Kerney's son, deputy Clayton Istee (formerly of the tribal police) while investigating a fire/homicide also discovers the remains of a woman who had disappeared over a decade ago.  Could the remains of a long missing student be connected with the slaying and cover-up of a recent homeless man?<br />The investigation leads Clayton to a small time gambler and his dealings with a local Indian casino.  But that's not all...the web to be revealed goes way beyond a few small time gamblers, but includes some very powerful and political figures that may have known the missing student many years back.  A reluctant Istee must turn to his estranged father, Kerney for help, and the relationship (or lack of) between the two established some time back comes to the forefront.<br />Kerney has his own issues however.  His pregnant wife is seeming to have certain maternal issues, he is scheduled to have a second leg operation, his dream home begins construction, and then he comes across an underground prostitution ring that may somehow be connected to a recent string of murders and gambling.<br />It's amazing how all these loose threads come together and are interconnected throughout the whole novel, and as in the authors recent style, you feel like you are reading 2-3 short stories, and only at the end do all the pieces of the puzzle fit.<br />McGarrity also introduces to new characters into the mix, a local undercover cop big on busting up the skin trade and a young female deputy who dons a disguise to get involved in the inner circles where drugs, prostitution, gambling, and politics are interconnected.<br />McGarrity does a great job of fleshing out new characters to breathe life into his southwestern universe, as well as keeping the long going story arc interesting when it comes to Kerney, his wife, and long lost son.<br />I look forward to many more of his novels to come.erney, his wife, and long lost son.<br />I look forward to many more of his novels to come.	2003-08-21

All of it was positive and I couldn't be happier with the novel, however, I didn't know what angle to expound on that hasn't been discussed so many times about his prior novels.<br />Then it dawned on me.  It was a departure from the norm of these novels.  Certain loose ends were tied up once and for all, the ending wasn't what one would expect...that is, it wasn't neat and tidy.  Also Kerney has progressed quite a bit, and author McGarrity introduced new ideas that surely will breathe life into the main character and makes for many sequels down the road.<br />But most importantly was the introduction of many new characters.  While this was and still is a Kevin Kerney novel, McGarrity debuts several new characters in this installment, and I was surprised how fleshed out they all became.  In some aspects this just wasn't a Kerney novel.  Two other detectives come into their own and a good deal of written word was on the following of their exploits.  It was like reading the same novel from 3 different and varying perspectives which was quite unique.  Only at the end was it clear they were all after a common goal, and it was done brilliantly.<br />Again, the ending was a nice change.  The CIA and a covert black-op organization aren't always fighting for good, or are they?  The events that unfold force the reader to constantly re-evaluate the 'color' of law, and even though this novel takes place in New Mexico...events taken place here will shape how US policy effects other regions and Kerney's decisions he will never know what ball he sets in motion.<br />Great read!	2003-07-29

The problem with writing strategy guides for any game as of late, is that many times the strategy guide is written prior to the final release of the game so it can be ready for sale as the game hits the shelves.  What ends up happening is that some information that is printed in the guide, has been changed, deleted, altered in some way from the actual game itself.  Such is the case with Star Wars Galaxies.<br />The Strategy Guide itself is beautiful for the most part.  Instead of grayscale pictures on regular stock paper, SWG Guide contains hundreds of gorgeous full color pictures on nice glossy paper.  That's right, the 1st 386 out of the total 494 pages are in color.  There is screenshots galore, highlighted tips, and tons of original and conceptual art.  The back of the book is in black and white, but it's just the index, stat's and tables, and appendences (no reason for color here).<br />Also included is a large pull out poster with art of the 8 beginning species a player can play.<br />Now the meat of the guide itself: For the beginner MMORPG user or 'newbie' to Star Wars Galaxies itself, this guide really does a great job getting over the concepts of gameplay and actually does provide strategy tips and hints on how to acclimate yourself to this game.  It describes in detail many aspects of the various menu's, choice's, do's and do not's a player can do much better that the 100 page manual included with the game.<br />However, there are a few sections I noticed (though sparse) that were more or less direct copies of in-game play text from dialogue boxes just reprinted here.  That's not necessarily bad, as many gamer's skip these factoids while in game play, but ends up being very useful information offline.<br />The guide is pretty logically divided into various sections:<br />1) New Player Introduction: Well done, and offers a nice background to the SW Universe as well as player etiquette and online terms that you'll need to get familiar with.<br />2) Character creation: Very in-depth, but straightforward and self-explanatory.<br />3) Interaction in Star Wars Galaxies: Discussion's on groups, parties, chatting, chat channels, e-mail, character commands, etc.<br />4) City Life: Discussion on what to expect and what one can do and find in cities overall.<br />5) Combat: Discussion of PvP, Player vs. NPC's, missions, factions, guilds, joining the Imperials, joining the Rebel Alliance, etc.  Choice of weapons either thrown, ranged, melee, hand to hand and concepts on what constitutes a hit versus a miss, how fighting affects your online character, etc.  Well done.<br />6) Economy: SWG is a player driven economy and can be confusing to the new player.  While this chapter is not the longest or most in depth, it does a lot of explaining concepts of why certain players will do the things they do, and how earning money id different for all players and their respective professions.<br />7) Crafting: Certain players (depending on their profession) actually make objects in the game.  Whether it's weapons, food, clothing, tools, home's, etc...this is the chapter to read.<br />8) Professions: Easily the largest section in the guide well over 150 pages.  An in-depth look at the paths of destiny a player can create for themselves, what goals to shoot for, and what they can do when they gain a level per-se.  Can be a bit boring and all most of this information can be found in game.  But there are some strategies that are worth taking note at.<br />9) Planets: An overview of the 1st 9 planets in the game.  Background on their histories, topographies, geographies, etc.  A few points of interest, and maps of main (but not all cities).<br />10) PvP, Appendices, other tables, reference materials.<br />Okay, with all that said on how rich this guide is, there are a few drawbacks:<br />1) The game is written primarily for new users.  Once you get the hang of the game, you may only use this guide for some weapon tables, maybe a few maps, and a few shortcuts on setting up your in game interface.<br />2) Some information is incorrect as of printing.  I already noticed that the game itself has made a few command changes, whether adding new ones, or deleting some that the guide fails to mention.<br />3) The nature of MMORPG's is that they always change.  SWG's has already announced that in the future new items will become available, new planets, new cities, etc...Because a game like this always evolves, sooner or later, many aspects of this guide may become obsolete.<br />Hope my review help, the guide did help me!ew shortcuts on setting up your in game interface.<br />2) Some information is incorrect as of printing.

As an avid reader and reviewer of Star Wars novels, I often look forward to each installment and often find myself turning page after page for juicy action and plot development.<br />However, 'Refugee' seemed to be a struggle for me and at times I fought the urge to skip ahead only because I am a SW loyalist.  After such great promise that was the climax for Force Heretic I with the induction of the Imperial Remnant allying themselves with the Galactic Alliance (formerly New Republic), I was expecting the first major push of the continued Vong war to begin continue here.<br />Not so.  Instead, the authors seem to have rehashed old material back from the pages of 'Truce of Bakura' where Leia, Han, Jaina and Tahiri must uncover a plot that holds the fate of the peoples of Bakura in question amongst themselves.  Yup, nothing really what-so-ever to do with the Vong war.  The only interesting development that takes place here is the further exploration of Tahiri and what she was, is, and who she may become.  If this story arc of Refugee was intended to be a vehicle for Tahiri, the ride was long with little pay-off.<br />On the other side of the galaxy, we have Jacen, Danni, Luke, Mara, Soontir Fel, and Wyn Fel in Chiss space continuing their search for Zonoma Sekot, the living planet which *may* hold the secret in beating the Vong.  But alas, yet another mediocre story line with no real payoff again.  Unless you count that the Chiss may reluctantly choose to fight alongside the Galactic Alliance and aide in the search of Sekot.<br />What I felt was this novels strongest point was the very few and brief chapters with Nom Anor.  His dealings with shamed-ones, and his manipulations of the new &quot;jedi heresy&quot; are great, and much more attention was warranted to this.<br />In summary, there are only 2-3 books left before the Vong war concludes, and in a time where the whole galaxy and all the major players should be ramping up (Gen. Antilles, Galactic Alliance, Palleon and the Imperials, Chiss, Hutts, Lando, Karde, etc. etc. etc.) for the biggie, they are sadly all MIA in this book.  There wasn't even one Vong skirmish.  So, if you skip this novel, you aren't missing too much of anything.and the Imperials, Chiss, Hutts, Lando, Karde, etc. etc. etc.) for the biggie, they are sadly all MIA in this book.

With a very small niche of 'fictional' books based upon the biblical end times, and usually dominated by the easy reading kid glove series of 'Left Behind', Britt Gillette's 1st attempt is outstanding.<br />While loosely interpreting prophetic events, Gillette makes this novel plausible to those that like to read a more technically and smart novel.  However, it is not so advanced that only rocket scientists can follow.  Imagine if you will biblical events crossing over into a Twighlight Zone and Star Trek episode...friendly, technical, and action packed.<br />Some criticize the first few chapters as being slow, however, I think it does a great job in fleshing out the main characters as we look at their specific origins.  Though the events of the 1st few chapters don't necessarily tie into the main plot, they plant the seeds on how characters will react to certain situations during the main events.<br />After events of September 11th, many of the most powerful leaders of the free world take on a secret project to develop a new type of weapon, to stamp out terrorism once and for all.  Nanotechnology promises to be the ultimate unstoppable force in which it has the potential to make nuclear weapons and all other conventional military obsolete.<br />To make nanotechnology a reality, the heads of many European countries form a new United Europe and elect Raphael Vicente as its new President.  During his early months as President, the 'assembler' breakthrough is achieved, and one of his first goals is to stamp out all terrorists.  Without giving the novel away, the nanotechnology becomes a force to reckon with and causes people to disappear, earthquakes, devastation on the oceans, while also providing many 'miracles'...curing the blind, making the lame walk, feeding the world and so on.  Is Raphael the antichrist and he doesn't even know it?<br />Realizing that this is a fictional interpretation of Revelations will help the reader out quite a bit.  My reason for not being 5 stars, was even though climax was great, I felt it was hurried in the end and then just stopped.  The very last chapter threw me, and not quite sure how it fit in to the rest of the book, otherwise it almost demands a sequel and really deserves to be recognized as a great read.ng 5 stars, was even though climax was great, I felt it was hurried in the end and then just stopped.

By giving it only two stars I may invoke a negative reaction, however, I couldn't shake the feeling that the first 100 plus pages was a very drawn out and boring filler material until the book picks up in the second half.<br />After the cliffhanger in 9, I expected to delve right into action that wouldn't stop with only a few years left of the tribulation. Sadly, only the first few pages deal with the cliffhanger in Petra as we left the Antichrist Carpathia making a strike against those believers under God's protection.<br />Unfortunately, after this is quickly resolved the reader embarks on a very lengthy and unexciting rescue attempt of a character George who is being held by the GC. Chloe, Mac and one other Trib force member decide to rescue him and while everything is under God's plan, it just seemed to me that there was so much fake dialogue and convenient holes in the rescue attempt I often fought the urge to skip ahead. It was this tangent made me feel that this was a separate novel altogether.<br />With that said, fortunately, the story does pick up, though time advances quite a bit. The sides are pretty much drawn up at this point, those believers who evangelize for God, and those that are loyal supporters of the Antichrist. While Carpathia has a smaller role in this book, his madness and evils become more apparent. He can't grasp that the 'curses' that are opened up on the earth are the judgments of God and tries to convince the populace that these things will pass, that his scientists are working on cures. Water is in short supply, and after another year into the tribulation so-called GC loyalists are starting to have second thoughts about Carpathia. There is even rumor that certain regions wish to defect as the world plunges into further chaos.<br />The Tribulation force on the other hand receive some assurances from the Lord.

Shade's of 'The Shield'	Well, maybe a direct comparison to The Shield is a bit of a stretch, but the stories discussed within these pages about life and career of James Wagner (former NYPD) walks a fine line between legal and questionable.<br />In this autobiographical look at his 'capers' post NYPD, you will be amazed that you keep turning the pages for his next installment.  Mr. Wagner's (Wags) accounts are gripping, and his stories are arranged and written in a clean 'street-smart' way, that is very entertaining and right to the meat.<br />He tells stories of being a hired body-guard for some middle-eastern princes visiting this country and looks the other way when they start using hard drugs.  He goes out to 'collect' money for various employers whose names you won't find on any Fortune 500 list.  In one story he finds himself looking for a kidnapped boy in the back streets of Turkey (blackmail and payoffs are common), another 'escorting' a middle-aged drunken heiress with a prosthetic hand and a parrot.  There are other accounts that are just as amazing, sometimes very funny, other times down right scary.<br />Throughout all his ordeals, one this is evident; he loves his family and would do anything for them, and proves it within the pages of this book.<br />However, though being such a likeable character, the reader will soon discover that this former NYPD agent spends many of later days living in the gray areas of the law, and sometimes may have stepped over it putting his life and others in danger for cash.<br />Mr. Wagner also has some very funny one-liners and metaphors that I will probably use as my own, they're that clever.<br />The reason I gave this 4.5 stars instead of a solid 5 is I had to wonder if all these stories were actually 100% true.  They sure sound like it, but with Wags seeing all this action, maybe some of them were slightly embellished?  I hope not and I'll give him the benefit of any doubt.  A little short, I would have liked a few more stories, but I was happy none the less.ppy none the less.	2003-04-01

In what is the 1st book of a three novel arc towards the tail end of the New Jedi Order series, the title 'Remnant' refers to those bad guys we love: The Imperial Remnant.  Yes, Grand Admiral Palleon and his forces while very briefly, (and I mean briefly) were touched upon during this whole Yuzhan Vong war have finally arrived on the scene.<br />But it seems that they are only now willing to put what's left of the Empire on the line as the Vong have bombarded the Imperial home planet of Bastion and driven the Empire into chaos.  With the different Moffs vying for power and a means to their own agenda, only Admiral Palleon (after suffering an almost fatal wound) takes the time to listen to Jacen Solo and comes to the conclusion that the only the only way the Empire will continue is if allies itself with the newly formed Galactic Alliance (previously the New Republic).<br />It is this climatic battle at the end of this novel with the Imperial Navy and a trickery scheme that the Jedi have hatched that send the Vong a serious message that makes this book worthwhile.<br />At slightly over 400 pages, I found the 1st half of this novel overly wordy and a few new story threads that were more or less very generic.<br />There was what now seems to be the requisite rendezvous of forbidden love between Jaina Solo and Jag Fel, the new secret mission of Han and Leia, and the examining of the galaxy of Luke and Mara.  While there is indeed some substance here that drives the overall story forward, it stills seems like a lot of fluff material to get to 400 pages.<br />The other redeeming quality of this book is the further adventures of Nom Anor and his quest to return to his once powerful spot amongst his brethren.  But being the master manipulator that he is, he chooses to use the Shamed Ones and their heresy teachings of the Jedi to advance.  His portions of the novel were scattered here and there and made the 1st half of the novel tolerable as they were fun to read.  His scheming invites the reader to turn the page one more time to see what he will do next and makes me anxious for book two.<br />But hopefully book two will be slightly tighter move at a faster pace.<br />Oh and did I forget to mention Jedi Tahiri now has some new curse that seems to be plaguing her sub-conscious.  Hope this develops into something worthwhile; otherwise it's just a gimmick plotline with no merit.ng invites the reader to turn the page one more time to see what he will do next and makes me anxious for book two.<br />But hopefully book two will be slightly tighter move at a faster pace.  <br />Oh and did I forget to mention Jedi Tahiri now has some new curse that seems to be plaguing her sub-conscious.

Kevin Kerny returns as author McGarrity delicately intertwines two seperate stories in 'Serpent Gate'.<br />Serpent gate begins with Kerny investigating a deranged man and his possible witnessing of a recent local homicide.  But Robert Cordova holds other secrets in his head, whereas most find him crazy, Kerney befriends Cordova and starts to piece together a series of events that spans years and goes much deeper than expected.  What is this Serpent Gate he keeps babbling on about?<br />However, just as this homicide seems to be put to rest and the case is almost shut, Kerny is swiftly reassigned to a burglary case.  But not any burglary.  It seems the New Mexico's governors office has been robbed of precious art amounting to millions, an officer is killed during a routine traffic stop, a young afficiando woman has seemingly disapeared, and drugs keep popping up.  All separate events?  Not to Kerney as he starts to sense that something seems strangley familiar.<br />His arch-nemisis, drug lord DeLeon, (from 'Tulorosa') seems to have his hands all over this, and now Kerney must return the stolen property, solve the disapearance of the young lady, catch the cop killers, and apprehend DeLeon.  He must do this why still keeping an occasional tab on Robert Cordova who seems to know something else important in his confused state of existance.<br />Soon Kerney is racing all over New Mexico seemingly to be both one step ahead of DeLeon, and then one step behind.<br />Author McGarrity does a fine, and 'believable' job in taking two completely different stories that could stand on their own and weave them together in such an entertaining way.  There's just about everything in here for a great mystery: forensics, action, politics, lively charcaters, twists, etc.<br />I look forward to many more Kevin Kerny novels	2003-01-27

Parker's 3rd installment of his Merci Rayborn character shows much growth as far as character development.  When we were first introduced to Merci back in 'The Blue Hour', she made many rookie mistakes and while much wiser on how the system works and more experience under her belt, her past mistakes tend to approach cases from a different angle.  Merci is therefor at war with herself, sure of her instincts yet still doubts herself.<br />Enter her current case: A young deputy, Archie Wildcraft,  awakens from a rock thrown in his living room window.  Upon investigation, he finds a bullet in his head, and when he awakes from his coma, he learns that his wife had been murdered as well, his fingerprints on the gun, blood on his robe, and his memory spotty.<br />Sgt. Rayborn and her partner Paul Zamorra are unsure what to think at first.  The evidence all seems to be in place, but something doesn't make sense.  Archie loved his wife, more so than any man could.  In digging into his past Merci learns much about Archies' character as soon believes he may have been framed.  But why and by whom?<br />Enter a dubious medical practice that sound to good to be true, a return on investment that made Archie and his wife rich, a mysterious size 16 foot print near the scene of the crime, hints of the Russian mafia, a cowardly doctor and snake venom.<br />Merci and Paul have only days to piece the puzzle together, for the press has already tried deputy Wildcraft and the DA is looking to make an arrest quickly.  But Wildcraft disappears, and his memory starts to come back.  Soon Wildcraft decides he must clear not only his name, but to bring justice to the person or person that took away his Gwen.<br />Black Water is not as sinister or dark as some of Parker's earlier novels, but its great strength is in the emotions of the main characters.  We are subjected to the inner thinking of Merci as she sees the world today, not only through herself, but through her young child.  She examines in depth the mistakes in her life including her relationships with men and her job.  Also, Parker did an excellent job getting the reader into the fragmented mind of Archie Wildcraft.  Wildcrafts emotions are intense and the reader secretly starts cheering for the main suspect.<br />But like all good Parker novels, there's a surprise twist at the end which always makes for a good read.<br />Even though this book continues Parker's practice of taking place in Orange County, CA., this time the cities involved take a back seat to the overall story.

Okay, it's book 14 of the NJO series (not including some of the eBook content on the net) and finally what's left of the New Republic seems to shift the tide of the war against the Vong.  However, even at the conclusion of this novel it appears the readers that are staying on this train are in for a long ride.<br />Now that Jacen has returned and has been reunited with his family, the enigmatic Vergere begins to reveal her true nature and origin and claims that Jacen Solo is headed for his true destiny.  Of course Luke, Mare and others are wary about Vergere's actions and keep a close eye on her.<br />Admiral Ackbar returns (with Winter in tow) and devises a new plan that will decisively turn the war around.  However in order to bring this plan to fruition the New Republic government needs to lend its support.  In doing so, a new Chief of State must be elected and as this happens a new Jedi Council is formed.<br />Han Solo is re-activated as a general and must pull together other scattered remnants of various characters to lend their hand in Ackbar's plan.  Leia briefly visits the Empire and requests their help early in the book, but nothing really becomes of that (I kinda wonder why this was included unless it's sowing the seeds for a future novel, but otherwise useless here).<br />Jaina Solo continues to battle with her emotions, often teased by the dark side.  She recognizes this and embraces the upcoming battles and her re-uniting with Jacen to distract her, but the question is for how long?<br />Good, however, where is this all going?<br />Another sub plot concerns the fact that a ultra secret New Republic operation has produced a biological weapon that will kill the Vong once and for all, however, the Jedi and a few others see this as a super-weapon with designs all too familiar with Emperor Palpatine's horror attached to it.  They must act to dissuade its use or slow down its activation before its too late so of course an epic showdown between the Vong and the forces of the New Republic must meet.<br />On the flip side the Vong introduce yet another new character, the Supreme Overlord over warmaster Lah and executor Nom Anor.  The Vong begin to realize that their forces are spread thin, and resources are becoming more limited.  They need a large victory to continue their efforts.  Enter the continual scheming of Nom Anor (such a great character).<br />I think the author did a superb job of action pacing and made very logical developments that held this book together.  I think the reader will be pleased.<br />Now my problems: Many known characters are absent, the meeting with the Empire was pointless, Jacen's destiny (without giving it away) is un-resolved and un-clear?, other plot threads in previous books were ignored, and most seriously...where is this all going?  Again, after 14 books (and two other currently being written) is there an end in sight?  I'm starting to feel that the overall picture of the NJO is getting stale and drawn out.forces of the New Republic must meet.<br />On the flip side the Vong introduce yet another new character, the Supreme Overlord over warmaster Lah and executor Nom Anor.

This novel takes place right about 1980-81 where 'a stand-up actor' has assumed the Presidency of the U.S., where Brezhnev's health is failing, and a young Jack Ryan has been assigned to Britain's Century House (CIA equivalent) as a promising new analyst.<br />Like many Clancy Novel's many small plot threads that seemed unrelated at first soon grow to a larger crescendo, and while the action in Red Rabbit only surfaces near the end, this novel serves more a history lesson both in characters and political ideology.<br />We learn more of the origin of Mary Pat and husband Ed Foley as they work as undercover CIA operatives in Moscow.  We also learn more about Ryan's and his wife Cathy's background as well as the relationship of Ryan's father-in-law.  But the richest gem here is author Clancy's take and history lesson on the cold war between the United States (including Britain) and the USSR.  The ideology is unfolded by the revealing thoughts of our numerous antagonists based upon their education, culture, previous leaders and their thoughts on religion and control.<br />The main plot centers around the fact that the current Pope has hinted that he will leave the papacy and return to his native Poland.  This instills fear in the Politburo as they sense an upheaval against there regime.  With Brezhnev knocking on death's door, a steely KGB opportunist decides to take action...assassinate the Pope.  But a lowly KGB agent, fed up with the system and life in the USSR has found his morals.  He must warn the west of this plot..but how to do it with out endangering his wife and child.<br />Thus begins the real cloak-and-dagger feel of this novel and the surprising way the British and U.S. (of course with Ryan's help) devise a plan to retrieve the KGB agent and thwart the plot.  I really did enjoy the history lesson that was not so veiled within these pages and gained a new understanding of the cold war itself.  Also, fans of forensics will love the surprise plot on how to smuggle the rouge KGB agent and his family out from under the KGB and Politburo.  But readers beware...don't expect tons of action you are accustomed to.e cold war itself.

Desecration, the 9th book in the 'Left Behind' saga is one of the better reads in this maxi-series.<br />From the opening chapter until the cliffhanger it is more or less non-stop action.  Well, that is to say there is much more action than some of the previous novels in this saga due to the fact the authors have only a few books left to cover some of the most explosive events of the 2nd half of the tribulation.<br />For our main characters, picking sides has never been more important than right now.  For Nicolae Carpathia, the Antichrist, has declared marshal law...and for those who do not brandish the mark of loyalty on either their hand or their forehead is put to death by guillotine.  Worship me or perish he declares as he breaks his peace covenant with Israel and makes a mockery of the most holy of temples.<br />Now believers of Christ and especially the foretold 144,000 make their way to safety in Petra with the Carpathia's forces in pursuit.<br />I was also happy to see that the authors had progressed or matured as writers quite noticeably with this 9th effort.  Though the camp dialogue still exists, it has improved and the atrocities and manipulations of the Antichrist are detailed.  In addition when God allows the 1st of the seals to be opened and his judgment brought down upon the world, the descriptions of fleshly boils and oceans of blood are pretty dramatic and page turning.  Even more so is Nicolae's response and handling of these global events, and now we see the world plunge further into chaos as even those with the mark of loyalty begin to question Carpathia's ways and their own decisions.<br />There are some who have taken the mark of the beast, and only when it is too late do they start to come around.  Woe to them.<br />There are some introductions of a few new characters, but one death amongst the main characters will shock you.	2002-09-09

I'd say about 85% of this novel takes a direct focus on Jacen and the enigmatic Vergere.  It seems that the Vong have had special plans for Jacen all along, not only as a twin to Jaina, but to help capture her as well.  Nom Anor and Vergere concoct a plan to turn Jacen...turn him to the Vong cause.<br />Everything Jacen has ever learned as a Jedi is now put to question as Vergere takes the roll of teacher.  She challenges Jacen to rethink his role in the universe and his destiny....a destiny without the use or link of the Force.  Jacen soon discovers that there is more to the force than just the light and dark sides.  He begins to retrain himself, not necessarily as a Jedi, but something else...something bigger than the Force as he learned it from Master Skywalker.  Jacen's abilities and sensitivity to telepathic and empathetic thoughts soon exceed even Nom Anor's and Verge's wildest dreams.  Jacen becomes something new, and Nom Anor revels in the fact that Jaina Solo will soon be his with the aide of his newest Vong prodigy.<br />But nothing ever ends up the way things are planned in a good Star Wars novel.  Jedi Ganner Rhysode has  heard the rumors....Rumors that Jacen lives and has returned to the core worlds.  His mission is his own, rescue Jacen and bring hope to the losing New Republic and crush the Vong spirits.  But Ganner stumbles upon a man once known as Jacen, but someone much different and much more powerful.  Soon, Ganner must make a choice and perhaps place his trust in a much darker and powerful Jacen.<br />I can't say enough good things about this novel.  Though there is plenty of action and background information given on the Vong, the trial and tribulations of Jacen under the thumb of Nom Anor and Vergere are very powerful for the reader.  While there is plenty of action for the reader, author Matthew Stover really gets the reader sucked into the psyche of Jacen.  Soon you really are emotionally attached to Jacen's character and feel his confusion and doubt of everything he though he believed.  The role of Vergere in this book was pivotal, and even though the reader may find her musings and teaching maddening at times (she speaks a lot in riddles and never gives a straight answer), but does a wonderful job in actually making the reader question everything we have read about the Jedi order and the Force.  Is it possible that there in more to the Force than just the light and dark sides?  This book will surely make you ponder.

Salvatore is pretty much accredited to re-launching the stagnant Star Wars novels with Vector Prime (the first novel in the continuing New Jedi Order series) and killing off Chewbacca.  With his style of writing, and previous work within the Star Wars universe, it was probably pretty easy for Lucasfilm to get Salvatore to pen the second movie.<br />I won't bore you with what you already seen in the movie, but I do believe that the novel of Attack of the Clones is required reading for all Star Wars fans, as it fills in many blanks that seemed to be missing from the movie.  It also ties the spanning years between Phantom Menace and AOTC.  Actually the reader won't even recognize the start of the movie until he is in chapter 5.<br />The first four chapters explains where Obi Wan Kenobi and a 10 year older Anakin Skywalker have been up to.  We are also introduced to Padme Amidala's family back on Naboo and learn much more on how she became a queen.  The detailed conversation between Padme and her sister (never seen in the movie) are a great set up on how she eventually falls for Anakin.<br />Also we learn how Shmi Skywalker was abducted by the Tusken Raiders, and much more origin information is given on Beru and Owen Lars (Luke's eventual uncle on Tantooine) and the dynamics of the Lars/Skywalker connection.<br />Throughout the remaining novel the reader is treated to more bonus material (much of which was indeed filmed, but hit the cutting room floor before release) that seems to open your eyes to the bigger political picture of that famous galaxy far, far away.  Questions such as: Who were the lost 20 Jedi?  How did Dooku ascend to power?  Why Jango had Boba created, and how was young Fett trained?  How did the Separatist factions begin?  It was this great filler material which earned 4 stars for me.<br />However, there were a few drawbacks.  Salvatore seems to rush through many of the epic battle scenes....I realize reading a novel is not the same as seeing your favorite characters and millions on CGI effects in a theatre, but I felt cheated reading the Obi-Wan/Jango Fett confrontation, the chase scene in the skylines of Courascant, and most of all the very rushed feeling of the climatic battle.  I couldn't shake the feeling that Salvatore was rapidly approaching the 300 page mark, and hadn't got to the main battle at the arena on Geonosis so he had to rush the writing taking a lot of steam and strength out of what should have been the mother of all battles for the book.  After that, the remaining plot points were only given a paragraph or two to be wrapped up, end of book.  This should only be worth three stars, as it could have easily been expanded properly with another 30-40 pages.r favorite characters and millions on CGI effects in a theatre, but I felt cheated reading the Obi-Wan/Jango Fett confrontation, the chase scene in the skylines of Courascant, and most of all the very rushed feeling of the climatic battle.

It's been a while since Hillerman penned a new Leaphorn &amp; Chee novel, and although this was a quick read, I was impressed that Hillerman could go back to the well with his two recurring characters and come up with a surprisingly fresh and original story blending Native American legends and homicide.<br />You'd think that after all these novels in Hillerman's career that we'd truly know his characters Leaphorn and Chee intimately, however, but he does an exceptional job in developing and fleshing them out further.  While we are constantly reminded by Leaphorn's dead wife and Chee's failed relationships, both take a turn yet again in this novel and begin new chapters in their lives.  It's great, because the reader doesn't get tired of the same people, they grow as we grow and we genuinely get interested in their fictional lives as we would are own, even if they have nothing to do with the plot.<br />In Wailing Wind, we finally see the emergence of deputy Bernie M., a recurring character who was always regulated to a barely supporting cast member.  I think Hillerman was grooming this novel just for her, as much of the plot revolves around Bernie discovering a dead body on the side of the hi-way on a routine patrol.  Then as the novel ensues, the reader begins a journey alongside Bernie....the way she thinks, the way she takes her job, her feelings toward Chee, etc.  There are some passages that we witness in which Bernie does her own detective work and speaks to her family clan members about happiness and love.  I think you'll be impressed with her development.<br />The story itself revolves around the discovery of Bernie's dead body, some placer gold, legendary area gold mines, a missing woman 20 years back, and the local story of the 'Wailing Woman' heard on the eve of Halloween by a group of teens near the defunct army base all those years ago.<br />It is up to Chee, Leaphorn, and Bernie to discover and link what these very different cases have in common after all these years.  What is evident is that retired Leaphorn is still the main detective and does much of the discovery on his own while dealing with the FBI, an old Indian, and Wiley Denton (Denton was once in jail for killing a man over a deal gone bad involving a gold mine, and has since lost his lovely wife).  Denton wants to hire Leaphorn to find his missing bride, but it seems Denton has many secrets involving his past and goldmines.<br />The ending has a brilliant setup, and by the time you get to the climax, everything comes together, and though you may feel slightly cheated (as you can pretty much guess the outcome), it is riveting to read.  I knew what I was about to ingest, but loved it anyway, as it fed into the whole mystery of the 'Wailing Woman', and what exactly happened to her.ll these years.

His goal is twofold: 1) Bring moral back to the New Republic, and 2) Taunt the Vong and have the war come to him.<br />Seeing that the author has previous experience in the SW universe especially with his novels revolving around Rouge Squadron, characters such as Antilles, Tycho, and others is second nature and well done.<br />Jaina Solo, Jedi Kyp Durron and pilot Jag Fel form a formidable trio as Jaina further assumes the role of the Vong trickster goddess and wreaks havoc on the various Yuuzhan forces sent to capture her.

From the first few pages and lasting until the very end, 'Immortal Coil' is one of the rare ST gems that goes beyond just telling an action packed, save the universe type story.  This one deals with the search for ones true self, or soul and what makes it that much better is that the person on this very moving quest is not human, but an android, Data.<br />As fans we have seen Data evolve over the years, even as so much as when he implemented his emotion chip and opened a new world unto himself.  Through his adventures he came across his 'brother' Lore, and even tried to create his own 'daughter', Lal, in his creators image.<br />The most recent adventure calls the Enterprise-E to a distant planet where Data and new Enterprise security chief Rhea McAdams have 3 days to uncover a plot that may not even exist, though Data's intuition suggests homicide.  What makes this supposed murder more interesting is that it involves more artificial beings, perhaps distant cousins of Data.<br />There are a few flashbacks containing some early adventures of Datas creator, Dr. Noonien Soong and colleagues Bruce Maddox and the mysterious professor Vaslovik.  These flashbacks serve as small background vignettes that drive the current plot forward.  While interesting, I felt these did not do the character of Dr. Soong justice and also seemed a bit jumbled at times.<br />During what is the main gist of the book, Data realizes he has an attraction to McAdams, and the feelings are reciprocated.  It is here that author Jeffrey Lang does a superb job of fleshing out Data, his innermost thoughts, feeling, beliefs and his quest for love.  Does McAdams indeed complete Data?  Well, it wouldn't be a ST novel if all the characters ended up being something that they first did not appear as, and there is no let down here.<br />The main plot widens when a long forgotten sect of androids, somewhat corrupted by time and incomplete programming show up on the scene and cause havoc for the Enterprise-E and its crew, Prof. Vaslovik (some nice things are revealed about our 'innocent' professor), Mr. Maddox, McAdams, and a long forgotten artificial intelligence known as M-5 (see ST: The Original Series).  Some may say that this novel went a little overboard on the amount of android characters, but I think it was handled really well and was justified in the telling of this story.  Their backgrounds are explained and what the tie in is to the original reason the Enterprise was summoned.<br />There is plenty of action, though more so revolving around Data than that of other characters, but this book was meant to revolve around Data anyway.  There are some really moving and artful passages as Data reflect upon himself what his role in the universe is, and will be many years after his friends die.  He wrestles with the idea of his own immortality, his uniqueness, his loneliness, his quest for being human, and more so the fulfillment of his creators designs and exploration of his emotions.<br />Very well done.E and its crew, Prof. Vaslovik (some nice things are revealed about our 'innocent' professor), Mr. Maddox, McAdams, and a long forgotten artificial intelligence known as M-5 (see ST: The Original Series).

This novel does not seem to revolve around one central character, but around a myriad of supporting characters, each beautifully crafted and unique, and how they view events in this mad world.<br />While there appears to be two central plot points; (solving a homicide mystery involving the London mafia, and ludicrous terrorist bombings/threats that make no sense to the world populace) the author does a fine job of taking serious events and putting a spin of dark humor on them.  The characters really do take a serious approach to events, but clearly shows the reader how flawed we are as humans and interpret things so wrongly.  The terrorists are anti-social, anti-commercial culture, anti-establishment but are bumbling fools.  The cops involved in solving a mysterious homicide are portrayed as the keystone cops, yet they really do think they are doing well.<br />There are funny moments throughout the book that will have you laughing, but more that will make you smile or grin than will have you rolling on the floor.  Again, its not so much the two plots that drive this book, but the bumbling characters and the desire to see what happens next to them and how they will handle it...brilliant.<br />The toughest obstacle for me as the reader was the constant jumping around of time frames and scenes.  The novel doesn't flow chronologically as the reader is taken from 1999, to the late 60's, then to the mid 80's, etc...etc...  And the plot points don't follow as well, it is as if you are reading 2-3 separate short stories, only for them to come together in a loose way towards the end of the book.<br />Now, I'm not knocking the novel.  It was entertaining...the style to me reminded me of the movies 'Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels' meets 'Pulp Fiction'.  Humor and tragedy coupled with both cultural and political statements.<br />I will read Cook's second novel if it is anything like Broken Eggshells.with both cultural and political statements.<br />I will read Cook's second novel if it is anything like Broken Eggshells.	2002-04-10
US	52913038	R1AX6WDDE9MZT6	0345428692	213123263	Dark Journey (Star Wars: New Jedi Order)	Books	2	22	25	N	Y	Complete filler material for Star Wars fans	Despite the great ramp up and action packed novel that Star By Star was (book 9 in the New Jedi Order Series), I felt this sequel did nothing to advance the overall plot of the Yuuzhan Vong war.<br />Hopefully you'll continue to read the rest of my review with an open mind on why I am critical on this latest adventure.  First and foremost, there is nothing wrong with the writing style; it is easy to read and descriptions are colorful and fun enough, but it's the actual lack of content that disapoints me.<br />After events in Star By Star, Jaina Solo, Zekk, Tenal Ka, Ganner and Lobacca have escaped the clutches of the Vong by using Nom Anor's analog frigate and eventually find there way to the Hapes Cluster (introduced way back in the Courtship Of Princess Leia).  Once here, Jaina is briefly re-united with Han, Leia, Luke and Mara, but the reunion doesn't last long.<br />Fearing Jacen Solo met a simliar fate of that to Anakin, the main plot line of this book is the seemingly downward spiral of Jaina towards the Dark Side.  Vengance is on her mind, and she demonstrates how cunning she can be by starting to taunt the Yuuzhan Vong into comming to get her.  However, this is done at a cost of self-discovery and maybe some heightened tesion between her and her Jedi peers.  Ironically, through all this, it is once rouge Jedi, Kyp Durron, who finally sees the errors of his ways over the last few years and decides now he needs to get back on track and bring Jaina back in line as well.<br />Tied into this is a political scandal with the ex-Queen Mother of Hapes and her bid for power of the Hapes thrown.  And if she can't have it, she will find a suitable Queen to be her puppet (enter a typical re-hashed plot of Prince Isolder being manipulated and Han being bumped out of the way).<br />It was also kinda silly to see that the Vong war-masters son, Khalee Lah, was introduced into the series as someone who may capture Jaina.  Well, it could have been a good idea if he was actually utilized much more than he actually was.<br />Han and Leia play some minor roles in this novel (namely at Anakins funeral which was very anti-climatic for a Star Wars novel), with Luke &amp; Mara playing absolutely none.  None of the rest of the familar cast was even present.  By the way, with such a large war going on where is the Imperial Remanent, Hutt's, Peace Brigade, etc..etc..?  A total lack of any mention or presennce in this novel really detracts from the overall feeling of the war.<br />The only interesting points in this novel were these: 1) A slight tease of a possible relationship between Jaina and Jag Fel (Baron Fel's son)...which never ends up going anywhere so I have no idea why it was included, and 2) Jaina and Lobacca discover a way using Vong bio-technology to confuse the enemy ships in battles.  This may have a dramatic effect on future novels and how the war progresses.<br />However, despite these two small shiny spots, the novel was pretty slow, little action, and long on Hapes politics.lly utilized much more than he actually was.<br />Han and Leia play some minor roles in this novel (namely at Anakins funeral which was very anti-climatic for a Star Wars novel), with Luke &amp; Mara playing absolutely none.

Westbrook's writing improves Moon Deer	In the 4th installment of Mr. Westbrook's fictional San Geronimo detective series, much more attention is given to the novels namesake, Howard Moon Deer.<br />Moon Deer is not your typical Native American.  He left his roots long ago to lead more of the white man's life, after realizing he wanted more than what the reservation could offer.  He has a thing for modern coffee latte's, classical music, food wraps, attractive women and other modern conveniences.  However, he still hasn't found his niche in life, and has returned to the New Mexican town of San Geronimo, where in order to make ends meet has hired on to as the assistant to ex-San Francisco cop Jack Wilder.  Jack was blinded while on the job back in California, and has since established a new life with his wife in San Geronimo, where he has opened his detective agency, Wilder & Associate.<br />While on a routine and boring stakeout behind a local Chinese deli, Howie witnesses a bizarre act.  Someone has driven down the dark alley late at night, dumped something in a garbage bin and left Howie's car the recipient of a hit and run.  When Howie's initial shock wears off he discovers a gruesome find in the dumpster, a severed head, but that's not all, it appears as if it has been cooked!<br />Here begins a mystery that soon engulfs the small town.  Who was driving the car?  Whose head was discovered and where is the body? And more importantly, why does the coroner believe the victim was the result of cannibalism, a fear that riles the locals in a frenzy as this seems to be a copy cat ritual.  A ritual that dates back over a thousand years when the Anazazi Indians took up residence in the surrounding areas.  Added to that, it appears that an English professor who was seen in the area has just disappeared.<br />Enter D.T., a young beautiful Indian anthropologist girl who stutters but seems to have captured Howie's fancy.  But Howie soon discovers D.T. is not always telling the truth, and seems to know more about the recent events than she is leading on to.  What is D.T. connection to the missing Englishman?<br />Jack Wilder and Howie are hired by one of the local Indian factions to look after D.T. and a recently discovered archeological find in the nearby mountains.  The discovered site seems to have fueled a fire between the local Indian factions, and don't really want the white man involved.  It seems bones have been un-earthed and key clues left behind that may once and for all settle the argument if the Anazazi were once cannibals are at sake.<br />But when another Indian boy shows up at Howie's front door shot, he has only minutes to give Moon Deer an unidentifiable artifact to hide before he dies.<br />Now Howie, D.T., the local War Chief and his shady companions must ascend the mountain on horseback and secure the site.  But again, not everything as it seems and Howie soon suspects everyone has his or her own agenda.  Clearly D.T. is lying about something, as is the War Chief.  Howie realizes that he may be over his head on this one and soon he is on the run to save his life when people start revealing their true colors.<br />The climax takes us back into town, where Wilder and his wife Emma, doing their own detective work uncover some interesting information about all the players and make another discovery that surprises the reader.  What was the artifact that everyone seems to be clamoring for back at Howie' place?<br />Overall, Ancient Enemy was a more solid read than Red Moon.  The author gave a lot of attention to Moon Deer, and made all the characters believable both in description and motivation.  I felt the story always moved forward, and there was really no lack in action and development.  It was also nice to see the author include more Native American lore that was missing from Red Moon, and I think the reader will notice that this novel was put together very nicely as compared to previous novels in this series.

Many readers will make the error, just as I did, in thinking all southwestern mysteries were Hillerman copies, chock full of Native American lore, spirituality, and culture.  Author Michael McGarrity has now proven me wrong, twice over, but in a pleasing way that will be having me read future installments of our hero Kevin Kerney.<br />Similar in style to Tularosa, the reader will find themselves involved in numerous, major plotlines, all seemingly unique from each other, but finally converging in the end into an explosive climax that does not let the reader feel cheated.  On the contrary, the multiple story threads are well paced between each other so as one does not get lost in the overall story direction and forget about certain characters or situations like other novels are known to do.<br />Here we find ex-cop Kerney just months after his role in 'Tularosa' just making ends meet as a temp park ranger for the forest service investigating a recent string of animal poaching.  It just so happens that two Mexicans (a grandson and grandfather) find themselves in the wrong place and the wrong time, and one of them gets murdered, Kerney finds himself as part of the investigations.<br />Enter his new pseudo partner, a young Jim Stiles, all too eager to impress Kerney and his superiors and ends up getting shot at, but by who?  Kerney is impressed by this young mans detective skills, but realizes that he himself was the target.<br />Omar Gatewood, the local sheriff is more a politician than a cop, and proves to be inept at the worst times, or does he have a master plan?<br />A family feud between ranchers Edgar and Eugene Cox has kept the twin brothers from speaking to each other in over sixty years, but when a note is delivered to Edgar he breaks the silence to confront his oppressive and abusive crippled brother.  Why did Eugene's wife disapear all those years ago?<br />Karen Cox returns to her roots as the new local ADA, and takes notice of the strong and silent Kerney.  She likes him, but has to work with him, and how does she deal with her fathers lie, and ensuing family feud.  And how does her current case and the assassination attempt on Kerney fit into all this?<br />The positive aspect of introducing a new female interest for Kerney is that the author really does not push it.  In Tularosa, Kerney was smitten by Sara who left at the end, and the author realizes that a new woman can't pick up the pieces immediately, but develops Karen for future novels.<br />The only problems I had with this novel, keeping it from five stars, was the authors constant, almost unending reminders that Kerney has a bad knee suffered from an injury years back.  Okay, I got it...knee hurt.  Also Jim Stiles girlfriend Molly's dialogue seemed a bit...fake.  I believed in all the characters in this novel except Molly...she seemed to stick out like a displaced soap star...thank God she was only a minor part of the novel and does not detract from any one else.<br />Other than those two quirks, I believe that Mexican Hat was an excellent adventure that had me guessing for quite a bit on how all these threads would weave together and I was happy with the end result.  I will be reading future installments..  She likes him, but has to work with him, and how does she deal with her fathers lie, and ensuing family feud.

Taken place shortly after soft cover 'Gateways #6' and hardcover 'Gateways #7', Being Human begins a new story-arc for both crews of the Excalibur and Trident.  While the hardcover Gateways #7 takes prior to this novel, it is not mandatory to keep the story flowing from 'Gateways #6'.<br />Being Human primarily examines the character of Mark McHenry and his mysterious past.  Previously touched upon in New Frontiers #10, where McHenry was able to stand off 'Q'.  Here, author Peter David brings that mystery to the forefront, and classic ST fans will LOVE the explanation.  (Hint: Classic TV episode where Kirk encounters the Greek god Apollo).  Just how powerful is Mark and where did he get hi `powers'?<br />As traditional with many of the New Frontier novels, other subplots and stories are developed within these pages:<br />Si Cwan and his sister Kallinda are offered a chance to restart the defunct Thallonian Empire (but nothing is as what it seems as Kallinda believes she has literally met the figure known as 'Death').  This is the secondary story that begins here and will no doubt be the focal point for the next installment.<br />Excalibur Security Chief Zak Kebron begins molting his hardened skin exterior.  What exactly is Kebron becoming?

While events revolving around the sudden appearance of Iconian Gateways through the Trek universe is the catalyst for these 7 books, only a very brief setup description in the first few chapters brings the reader up to speed on what's going on.<br />In this New Frontier tale taking place in old Thallonian space, we learn that two warring races have been separated from their home planet and dispatched to two separate planets in order to refrain themselves from mutual extinction.  These two races that share  centuries old hatred for each other are introduced to Gateway technology, allowing them to invade each others planets for the first time since their separation.  These scenarios are very action packed and will have the reader turning pages like mad.  These skirmishes and their outcomes begin a frenzy and renewed interest in these warring races into wiping each other out.  Thus, the UFP sends the Trident and Excalibur to each planet involved to stop a major war from brewing and to also find out who's behind the sudden appearance of the Gateways.  It seems that the Gateway's in and of themselves are a threat to the known universe, for their misuse could end up causing irreparable damage to all systems.<br />Think of the Aerons and Markanians (the two opposing races) as a social commentary of or own history.  Substitute either the Hatfield's and McCoy's, Black vs. White, religious belief against religious belief, or whatever, and you have Peter David's message in a nutshell.  Mr. David once again does a brilliant job of barely disguising our own problems that have plagued mankind's thinking for years in the guise of a great science fiction story.<br />In addition to a great stand alone story, the author continues to develop other subplots that continue from previous novels (see: Moke, Dr. Selar, &amp; Kalinda), introduce new ones (see: Burgoyne, Shelby, Mueller) and new characters: M'Ress &amp; Arex (displaced in time from Captain Kirk's era), Ensign Phyetus and others.  The author makes each of these characters unique with fascinating stories of their own that make the New Frontier series so entertaining.  Mr. David does this in a way that always propels the larger story forward without the feeling of crowding these in for filler material or quick levity.  These aren't your regular `red shirts' or menial characters usually downplayed in the television series or other books.<br />Finally, the climax is full of excitement, and just when you think it is over, Peter David throws in his classic twist and cliffhanger.

I picked this up on a whim in a need to satisfy my curiosity on a south west mystery genre usually dominated by Tony Hillerman or J.A. Jance, and I was pleasantly surprised.<br />What you won't find here is a lot of Native American spirituality or beliefs, and gone are the all to traditional Navajo lore so custom to these books.  But you will find a very well written novel that is very believable and exciting to read.<br />Main character Kevin Kerney (formerly a cop) has been spending the last few years in the Santa Fe area as a ranch/handy man and is approached by his former partner (and former friend) to locate his missing son.  It seems Kerney's godson (a soldier out of White Sands Missile Range) is missing, and Kerney make the trip down south to locate the boy.<br />Enter Sara Brannon, she's a captain in the military and is in charge of the military cases on the base.  Reluctant in helping Kerney at first, they soon both uncover a mystery that goes beyond just the awol soldier.<br />About 1/2 way through the book, a new story begins.  It looks as if it is a totally separate and isolated incident from the one that Kerney and Brannon are working on, and we have the introduction of some new characters.  Their adventures take them just south of the border of Texas and New Mexico into a sleazy border town in Mexico itself, run by a local drug lord.  The plot reveals missing antiques worth a whole lot of money to someone.  This story in itself is exciting and even becomes more so as soon, the two stories become inter-twined with each other.<br />With everyone after the missing goods and how this ties into some of the cases back at White Sands, a much larger conspiracy is uncovered and Kerney and Sara must do everything they can just to stay alive.<br />The climax was good and left the reader satisfied.  There was a small twist at the end, that unlike most other endings, not everything turns out the way it should have.  The players here do not return to the norm.<br />McGarrity writes well.  His descriptions of landscapes and towns are accurate as I myself have been to these areas.  The overall pace of the book is good, never to slow, and yet actions are not hurried to get to the end.r />McGarrity writes well.

After the events that take place in the 'Indwelling', Nicolae Carpathia (Satan) has now declared himself a deity, and has taken a more aggressive stand against those who choose not to worship him by veiled speeches and manipulative gestures.  While sporadic throughout the book, Nicolae's demeanor and character development has definitely changed.  Still charming on the outside, his means of setting up a one world dictatorship/religion have sent the world populace in taking up a more definitive side...with him or against...and those against face death.  We see plots that were introduced within the first two novels finally come to fruition in book eight.<br />We learn that the 'Mark' (of the beast) will now be administered to people as a symbol of loyalty to Nicolae and his regime, and those that refuse will be beheaded.<br />About 3/4ths into the novel there is a scene that takes part in Greece where religious and criminal prisoners are being kept.  They will be among the first to choose the Mark or deny it, and in a very moving and emotional chapter, a young woman's refusal of the Mark and her subsequent beatings and beheading bring other fence straddler's to Christ, while others clearly choose Nicolae.  This chapter I found to be the darkest and morose chapter yet, but very inspiring at the same time.<br />Three other characters get a lot of attention in this novel: 1) Hattie Durham, after certain personal events, finally makes up her mind on her future and where she stands in these end days, 2) Chaim absorbs as much biblical training as possible from Ben-Judah, possibly to lead Jewish survivors to New Zion, and finally 3) David Hassid who must overcome a personal crisis in New Babylon concerning a loved one and realizes he only has days left within the Carpathia regime to flee or receive the Mark.  How will he escape, and how will he retain his knowledge of Nicolae's inner circle.<br />All other characters are present with little sub-plot development other than the books climax where Rayford Steele, as re-invigorated leader of the Tribulation Force starts handing out aggressive assignments for his people.<br />Overall, I found this novel a bit slow and stretched out at times, but there are definitely moments of extreme tension, and a sense of urgency amongst central characters.<br />The climax ends with Nicolae returning to Israel, where his true colors will be shown to the Jews and God's next judgment will be revealed to the world.books climax where Rayford Steele, as re-invigorated leader of the Tribulation Force starts handing out aggressive assignments for his people.  <br />Overall, I found this novel a bit slow and stretched out at times, but there are definitely moments of extreme tension, and a sense of urgency amongst central characters.<br />The climax ends with Nicolae returning to Israel, where his true colors will be shown to the Jews and God's next judgment will be revealed to the world.	2001-10-11

After the events that take place in the 'Indwelling', Nicolae Carpathia (Satan) has now declared himself a deity, and has taken a more aggressive stand against those who choose not to worship him by veiled speeches and manipulative gestures.  While sporadic throughout the book, Nicolae's demeanor and character development has definitely changed.  Still charming on the outside, his means of setting up a one world dictatorship/religion have sent the world populace in taking up a more definitive side...with him or against...and those against face death.  We see plots that were introduced within the first two novels finally come to fruition in book eight.<br />We learn that the 'Mark' (of the beast) will now be administered to people as a symbol of loyalty to Nicolae and his regime, and those that refuse will be beheaded.<br />About 3/4ths into the novel there is a scene that takes part in Greece where religious and criminal prisoners are being kept.  They will be among the first to choose the Mark or deny it, and in a very moving and emotional chapter, a young womans refusal of the Mark and her subsequent beatings and beheading bring other fence straddlers to Christ, while others clearly choose Nicolae.

Many strategy/guide books fall short of what their title intends, but not so with Arcanum.<br />This book is wonderfully detailed.  Different chapters focus on different elements within the game including: character classes, technology, magick, monsters, maps, quests, weapons, armor, the lesser and greater gods, npc's, formulas and schematics and many other tidbits you never new were in the game until you read this book.<br />I was very impressed with the character creation sections and its very detailed explanations of customizations, auto-schemes, attributes and more.<br />The monster appendix is great, and identifies about 85% of creatures you will encounter with pictures and 100% with stats.<br />Weapons, armor, potions/elixirs, schematics/formulas are treated with the same detailed information and can really help you find/discover hard to locate parts or uses for objects that you will come across.<br />The chapter on Magick is also very detailed, much more so than the original manual and gets you excited about following that college of study within the game.<br />The maps are priceless, as they are pretty well laid out and complete.  However, I did find a few minor errors that were mostly aesthetic.  Namely, one of the maps the editors forgot to label (though the legend appears below the map...it corresponds to nothing), and another map is a bit blurry.<br />The walkthrough and quests are pretty complete from what I can tell and really aid in the hint department if you get stuck on a puzzle.  But, I did think there were some obscure references to other quests that could have been explained better.  It can be slightly confusing at times to follow the walkthroughs and quests for the page layout and cross-referencing is a bit odd.  But, if you study it for a few minutes, you'll get it.<br />There are no color pics anywhere in the manual, the pics that do exist are in gray scale.  Most pictures ties in directly to an object, character or map, but there are a few random pieces of steampunk art mixed in.<br />What keeps this book from 5 stars is the few errors I found that were probably an oversight from the editing process.  Like I said a few blurry pics, a few missing labels, a strange layout in the walkthrough chapter, but otherwise a fantastic and 'very' detailed strategy book of any game I've seen in a while and well worth the cover price.random pieces of steampunk art mixed in.<br />What keeps this book from 5 stars is the few errors I found that were probably an oversight from the editing process.

The Cassandra Compact was a fairly easy read even at 387 pages.  It reminded me of beginners level Tom Clancy novel and the overall story seams to be nothing unique in the realm of global spanning espionage.<br />I found the first few chapters to be quick and action packed, but somewhat 'bubblegum' in nature when it comes to spy/espionage type novels.  After the reader settles into the meat of the novel, it actually does become better.  There are small subplots that take place in Italy, Russia, and scattered America locals that are crafted well and move the story along.  The reader can eventually make the ties and the cast is not so large where you forget all the main players.  I also found the dialogue somewhat realistic and so these were all good points in my review.<br />However, the ending was hokey and unbelievable with too many plot holes that were never resolved by the end of the novel.  After a great build up to the climax, the authors seems to have hurried the ending into some sort of Hollywood action blockbuster that while fun, was unrealistic.<br />A few vital characters who seemed to have great influence and motivation through the beginning of the book were suddenly dropped about two-thirds through which I found very disappointing.<br />The plot more or less centers around a few militaristic Americans who decide they are above the law and using their power and stations in American government decide to 'steal' a portion of Small Pox from the Russian equivalent of the CDC.  They must smuggle the virus back into America, and then secretly perform mutation experiments upon it during a space shuttle flight to create the ultimate bio-weapon, and bring it back to earth safely and use it to eradicate our enemies.  Of course the plot is discovered by Dr. Jon Smith and his peers in Covert-One (a hush-hush black op group founded in America), and the novel at this point for Dr. Smith and company to foil the bad guys.  Unfortunately there were too many clich&eacute; characters: the young male computer hacker, the female traitor, the rich banker, and the old wily military chief with secret designs.<br />This is a good book if you are looking for light reading over a few day business trip or weekend relaxer, but for those that like the style of Larry Bond or Clancy this will probably fall short of your expectations.ters: the young male computer hacker, the female traitor, the rich banker, and the old wily military chief with secret designs.  <br />This is a good book if you are looking for light reading over a few day business trip or weekend relaxer, but for those that like the style of Larry Bond or Clancy this will probably fall short of your expectations.	2001-09-14

While the 1st book in this series was very dramatic and full of adventure, I found Rebirth somewhat stagnate in moving ahead the Invasion of the Yuuzhan Vong towards the core worlds. Most of the characters are present that we have gotten to known during the New Jedi Order series, however, there is a noticeable lack of Droma, the Hutt situation, Lando, R2 and many more. What the reader has to realize though is that the New Jedi Order is slowly passing the torch to new characters and the Solo children and now so heavily depending on the mainstays of the Star Wars Universe. The Republics ill will towards the Jedi is mentioned as is the Peace Brigade but you'll find little advancement on this. The reader is still left guessing what is happening with the Imperial remnant and the Hutt's who were much more influencing in the beginning of this series. What Rebirth focuses on is tying up a few threads left behind such as what becomes of Tahiri, the Maw Installation, where Booster Terrik and Mirax have been, Luke's ideals of his Jedi academy, Kyp Durron and his squadron, Vong manipulator Nom Anor, Mara's illness and the familiar known as Veregere. I was disappointed with the author's handling of Han and Leia. Their contribution to this installment seemed more like filler material than anything else, other than a few heart to heart talks between Han and Jacen but nothing that this novel needed to progress. Jaina's story was a bit interesting in her deals with Kyp Durron. There is a definite love-hate relationship that Jaina feels to the handsome Kyp, but when all is said in done Jaina has more questions than ever about where Kyp lies in the Force. It is apparent that he walks a fine line between the light and dark sides. Their plot of the book was probably the one with the most substance as together with the aid of Rouge Squadron, Kyp's dozen, and other Republic military factions try to take out what they 'believe' is a new Vong super weapon. The third subplot involves Tahiri, Anakin, and Corran Horn. Also entertaining, but was used more as a vehicle to develop a closer bond between Tahiri and Anakin. However, anything that Corran is involved in is fun for he is a Correllian by blood, sarcastic in nature, and is a Jedi. Here the trio is jumping all around the Vong as we discover new plots hatched by Nom Amor. Finally, the 4th subplot had to deal with the heretic shaper Nen Yim. By far this was the most interesting venue of the whole novel, as Yim plots to regain her namesake from disgrace. She proves to have the beginnings of a new villain to watch out for in the future. For at her age, she already knows she needs to be sneaky and sly even amongst her own kind to advance. And not just to eliminate the Infidels but to weed out the egocentric Vong that are holding the invasion back from blunders. There were a couple instances where new plots were introduce in a few short paragraphs but were never mentioned again in the book....most likely to be picked up in future installments, but nevertheless leave the reader hanging on why a thread would even be introduced if it were not to be followed up on. Disappointing. If this is the first book in the series you read, youll be lost.

Joe Trona, 24 yrs old, deputy who works in the Orange County jail system witnesses the murder of his adoptive father.  But this is no ordinary murder.<br />Joe Trona, who had his face terribly scarred as an infant was adopted at the age of five by Will and Mary Trona.  Will, an Orange County Public figure raised Joe unlike his other siblings.  Joe was privy to the secrets his father kept and the political circles his father ran around in.  Joe honed his skills in fighting and marksmanship at the personal sacrifice of 'fitting in' with a society that judges more to appearance than someone's substance.<br />In investigating the murder of his father, Joe learns that his father was not the Robin Hood character he portrayed himself to be.  Just as Joe thinks he gets closer to learning the identity of the murder, he discovers a very intricate web of lies, deceit, and conspiracy that his father tried to just stay slightly ahead of all these years.  Was his father a saint, or was he something else that only Joe can decide.<br />Throw in a kidnapped girl, a crazy brother, and a violent rich father of the two aforementioned, and the story gets deeper.  This all takes place in Orange County, CA, with actual locations (I know.I live here.).  Mr. Parkers descriptions and moods are very accurate to the locals he places his characters in.<br />Overall the story was very entertaining, and one of the best mysteries I have read in a long time.  Each chapter had me changing my mind on who the killer was and the motivation.  Every suspect threw in a new monkey wrench and the plot got thicker and thicker.  There were other supporting characters that added new dimensions to Joe as well, and you wouldnt consider them filler material. Loved it.<br />What was really keen about this novel was most of it was told from the perspective of Joe.  Through his tortured eyes and life he needs to separate fact from fiction, who's manipulating who, and most importantly a new discovery of emotions he has kept under wraps his whole life from his dramatic injury and scarring.  He learns much about himself over the course of the investigation, which proves how great a writer T. Jefferson Parker can be.<br />Silent Joe moved at a good pace, was always interesting, many plot twists, and a surprise ending that was very rewarding to the reader.

Though I wondered, what could Mick Foley say to fill another 400 pages that wasn't covered in the first book?<br />Well, there's plenty and I'm convinced he could write a third book with more on the road stories.  I enjoyed this book with almost the same enthusiasm as the first, however, Mick does have a few moments of personal agenda tangents that seem to disrupt the pace of the book. (More on that later).<br />So what is 'Foley Is Good' about?  Mick Foley takes a more of a personal reflection on his life and ideals outside of his time in wrestling.  Don't get me wrong, this book is still clearly about wrestling as an industry, but more of a reflective look on how wrestling is interpreted by the media and watchdog organizations.  He infuses his stories and observations with facts and side notes that are very interesting and enlightening.  Why doesn't the media ever take these angles?<br />The primary focus of this book is about the remainder of his career from winning the WWF heavyweight title the 1st time through his retirement.  WE read about the mental decisions and struggles of actively choosing to step out of the spotlight in lieu of your body and being with your family.  He talks about his last few matches in great detail and fervor; it is so good, you think you are watching the match instead oif reading it.<br />Their are a few personal stories regarding The Rock, HHH, Vince, Test, Al Snow, Droz, and a few others that are very kind hearted in one instance and amusing in another.  Mick paints his fellow wrestlers in a light that we normally wouldn't see because we aren't behind the curtain or on the road.<br />The only draw back that made this book slightly sub par from his first were his lengthy tirades on the media and especially the ill-informed PTC.  Though I agree whole-heartedly with Mick's feelings, at times he seems bitter (he has the right to be!) for he gives fact after fact on how the PTC and the media got stories wrong, or crafted vignettes which painted today's pro-wrestling as the downfall to pre-pubescent society.  It really amazes me at the tactics some of these organizations used, and they should be ashamed.  However, Mick went on and on about these at times, which slowed down the book.<br />Otherwise another great read by Mick Foleyto be!) for he gives fact after fact on how the PTC and the media got stories wrong, or crafted vignettes which painted today's pro-wrestling as the downfall to pre-pubescent society.

US	52913038	R2SEG55HC32REH	0345442989	164434464	Star Wars: Cloak of Deception	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Great prequel to Episode I.	I was very impressed with this novel from the very beginning through the end.<br />After seeing Episode 1, I'm sure you and your friends pondered on how the Neimodians and Darth Sidious first got involved.  How did the Trade Federation set up the blockade of Naboo?  Just how did Queen Amidala become queen?  How did Chancellor Vallorum become perceived as incompetent as to heading the Republic?  And just who is this enigmatic young Senator Palpatine?<br />Well this novel does an excellent job of setting the stage for Episode One.  The double talk and blameless Palpatine shines as the master manipulator.  We stand in the shoes of Vallorum and watch the invisible power plays consume his effectiveness as a leader.  We watch the rise of Rune Hakao and Nute Gunray and their dealing with this cloaked figure who issues them a deal they cannot refuse.<br />Was also nice to see more of the Jedi council in action.  Mace Windu, Yoda, Qui Gon and even a younger Obi-wan in their attempts to bring peace to the galaxy.<br />The majority of the story revolves around a plot and conspiracy to bring down Chancellor Vallorum as head of the Republic and stave off a boiling contention between the worlds of the outer rim and the core through trade routes, pirates, and taxation.<br />New characters are introduced into the Star Wars mythos that are really exciting, and their actions, while at the time may seem innocent, set the stage for what will become the Empire....with everyone's strings being pulled by Darth Sidious.<br />A few other characters make cameos including Bail Organa and A young Governor Tarkin.<br />This is not your typical Star Wars novel.  It is very deep in conspiracy, plot twists, and black ops.  A very enjoyable read.	2001-07-06

While book 6, Assassins, led to a climactic ending whereas Nicolae suffers a fatal blow to the head and many other events were set in motion, I expected much more out of The Indwelling.<br />Much of the cast stays the same with some second string characters meeting their demise.  However, the introduction of a few new characters keeps the overall story fresh and moving along and keep this very long series entertaining.<br />My biggest disappointment with this installment was the lack of overall action.  After a great cliffhanger in number 6, I expected this really to pick up after we have reached the midpoint in the series.  Not really.  Though I understand this is fiction based on fact, and I truly believe this book is doctrinally sound, I wanted this to be a real page turner.<br />It was not until the end where the indwelling of the antichrist actually takes place, and while dark, I wanted something much more ominous.  The events described are indeed scary, but with only pages left before this episode ended, I felt like there was something missing.<br />There is some character development of Rayford Steele here as he comes to grips with his internal struggle and faith.  Also there is a search for a new safe house along with the engineered deaths and cover-ups of some believers by the Global Peacekeeping Forces.	2001-07-05
US	52913038	RZ6SDO5BG66EC	0375501851	363806782	White Teeth	Books	3	21	23	N	N	Wonderful characters, but choppy plot and time frame.	I've read quite a few of the other reviews of White Teeth and I found merit with each one, however, these reviews often contain spoilers.  This book should be read for enjoyment, and you will find its overall structure shies away from traditional novels.<br />Let me say that my observations of Zadie Smiths book should not be taken as criticism, but as my own observations.<br />1) The characters are phenomenal.  The myriad of cultural backgrounds divided amongst genders equally makes for some very humorous and real situations.  While many of these characters 'quirks' can be outlandish, at the same time you believe them to be true, and you know you have crossed these peoples paths in your own life.<br />2) Cultural commentary.  With such a diverse cast the reader is exposed to various cultural ways and ideologies that were prominent during the late 70's through the 90's.  While White Teeth's setting is England we are reminded much of Jamaican, East Indian (Bengali), English lifestyles while mixing in various religious and educational beliefs.  This make the characters even more dynamic, as each is much different from all the others, even the twins Millat and Magid.<br />3) Time frame.  As mentioned above this story, or should I say vignettes of characters lives take place predominately over the last 25 years of the 20th century.  However, there a few flashbacks to 1945, the 60's and else time.  But the story does jump around a bit, bouncing between years and decades, back and forth.  While this doesn't detract from the overall story, it can throw off the pace of the reader.<br />4) Plot.  Imagine a book that is roughly 450 pages long, and you only become aware of the plot, or the climax within the last 100 pages.  It seems that while the characters are very rich, and their individual stories are entertaining, there is no apparent plot for the majority of the book.  Surely by the time we get to the climax where all the characters are present (for their own selfish motivations) can the reader thread together the loose connections.  Don't get me wrong, it does all make sense at the end, but the 1st 300 pages will have the reader wondering what the overall story is and if they are just reading very long character sketches.<br />Despite my three star rating, I do highly recommend this book.  I was laughing hard at times, and could identify with the characters as real people.vations) can the reader thread together the loose connections.

As a big fan of Tony Hillerman and Rudolfo Anaya, I was looking for another author to quench my southwest mystery thirst so I came about Skeleton Canyon as my first J.A. Jance novel.<br />Overall, the novel was entertaining.  The author does a good enough job with the main character's backgrounds that you don't need to read the previous novels to understand their motivations, back stories, etc.<br />New characters are described just as well, and the reader can really identify with these 'genuine' people and not outlandish or stereotypical cutouts.<br />The story itself was fresh as was the mystery, though it did take a while to really delve into the mystery.  For a novel that is just shy of 400 pages, it seems that the mystery aspect didn't really take off until midway through.  However, the preceding setups and side stories are entertaining enough to push the novel forward anyway, keeping the reader's attention despite the lack of early mystery.<br />The only disappointment I had was with the lack of southwestern flair I am used to with a Hillerman novel.  Though the novel takes place in Arizona, near the border of Mexico, there is little reference to local culture, native American theology, a typical south west descriptors.<br />The payoff/climax is good and there were a few twists at the end that I found debatable between a little 'convenient' and unique.  The last chapter in itself had little to do with the novel, or even less of a future setup for a next book.  Just seemed a bit odd in placement and context, but not bad.<br />Overall a good read, and look forward to other Joanna Brady novels.	2001-05-14

'Restoration', the 10th installment of Peter David's new vision of the Star Trek Universe is a pretty fun read, but nothing overall surprising stands out,  and a return to a type of sci-fi genre not to uncommon in books of old, especially for Trek fans.<br />That is the survival of Calhoun (What good captain of Trek lore ever dies when the ship goes down?) and his adventures on a technological primitive planet patterned after any old western movie.  Of course, Calhoun is the stranger in town and through some good ole fashion fights becomes the town sheriff.  As his story unfolds he befriends a single mother and her child, who come to look to him as their knight in shining armor and father figure respectfully.  But this is Trek, and not everything is so predictable....see, the woman can control the weather and the townsfolk of this simple western town both need and fear her, and the story is her struggle for acceptance, while Calhoun is looking for a way off the planet.  There is the obligatory showdown in town, the strong moralistic town leader, the bumbling town folk, and of course the moronic criminal brothers who live just outside of town just looking for a fight.  What is the strong point here is the relationship forged between the boy, Moke, and Calhoun (who recently lost his son), and the mother, Rheela and her mysterious past and feelings fro Calhoun.<br />The other part of the novel takes Captain Shelby (who was just promoted) and gave her command of her own ship, the Exeter.  On her first shakedown mission, she finds that many of the rules that she was so adamant about adhering to serving under Calhoun, are not that easy when she herself is now in the Captain's chair.  While trying to negotiate a peace treaty between two planets, she reminisces about her time with the presumed dead Calhoun, her old shipmates, and trying to fit in with her new crew.  She is torn between Starfleet doctrine and the decision that made Kirk and Calhoun legends.<br />Towards the end of the novel, Robin Leffler is back to tie up events from book 9, and unfortunately was kind of boring.  This was longer than it needed to be and took away from Calhoun and Shelby's story.<br />In the end, things come full circle as a new Excalibur is being commissioned, and other New Frontier characters return.  I don't want to spoil the ending, but it was a bit too predictable.  Looks like this book will be the re-launch point for new New Frontier stories.e end of the novel, Robin Leffler is back to tie up events from book 9, and unfortunately was kind of boring.

Though 'Conquest' by it's moniker looks like it's part one of a two novel series by Mr. Keyes, it is indeed a stand alone self contained novel with events taking place shortly after 'Balance Point'.<br />Our novel starts with a great prologue which takes the reader bouncing about the galaxy and peering in on the fate of certain Jedi characters we have become familiar with over the last few years in print media...and the outcome is pretty dim.  This sets the tone and back story for events that are being discussed within the government of the New Republic, more specifically between Luke Skywalker and the Bothan, Fey'la.<br />Tensions arise and fissures deepen within the Jedi ranks as Kyp Durron's (and his followers) see events and Jedi responses different from what appears to be a passive Luke.  It seems the Vong want Jacen Solo and all Jedi in return for no more aggression.  While both sides of the Jedi know this is a hollow promise from the alien invaders, the choice to bring the war to them or to defend the galaxy in a hotly debated subject.  But as these events are taking place, the Vong have their sights set on Yavin 4 and the Jedi academy there...and their targets: the unprotected Jedi children.<br />Here is where the book really begins.  Anakin, in secret and against the wishes of Uncle Luke races to Yavin to help evacuate and protect the children.  Upon entering Yavin's system, Anakin makes a startling discovery that involves the Peace Brigade and is forced to land.  Shortly thereafter the Vong show up, and Anakin and a hand full of children are on the run through the jungles of Yavin 4.  Here, Anakin's best friend Tahiri (and Jedi in training) is captured and brought to the 'Shapers' for experimentation.  Now Anakin must rescue Tahiri from her captures in a soul searching adventure that helps him discover more about his own Jedi heritage and beliefs.  But he is not alone....It seems a fallen from grace Vong warrior with his own agenda must also get into the complex.  So human Jedi and alien Vong, must learn to put their differences aside and help each other out.  Together, this unlikely pair must battle the opposition, and their selves to get to the end.  They have many conversations that are told from totally polar opposite points of view, but soon come to understand each other and their cultures.<br />This is where the book shines.  The majority of the novel is an Ankin adventure, however, the reader benefits by learning so much more about the Vong than any previous novel in the New Jedi Order series.  We learn about the Vong caste system, the hierarchy of their people, more background about their gods and beliefs, and that not everything or everybody within the Vong race agree with the invasion.  You see, in like any culture their are those that are oppressed, or have a different belief system, and for the first time we see division amongst the Vong.  Some might consider them heretics, but it is revealed that all Vong don't share the same mindset.<br />What is scary is the power of the Shapers.  Regarded with reverence amongst their race, the Shapers are the bio-engineers creating horrific new species and weapons through gene manipulation and torture.  Unfortunately, Tahiri is their lab rat, and Anakin can feel her pain and transformation into something much darker.<br />Most of the original Star Wars cast is not here, but there are appearances of Booster Terrik, Corran Horn, Talon Carde and Shada.  All in all, this was a great insight to Anakin and a great novel for such a limited focus on the overall picture of the invasion.complex.

US	52913038	R35D0QZTGOP6H9	1582340811	352322588	The Toy Collector	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Why do we laugh at people's self destruction?	Because we are reminded every day on how easily we can fall into the main character's own pitfalls.<br />Despite the quirky and attractive cover The Toy Collector is somewhat misleading on first glance.  What appears to be a novel about the exploits of a Gen X'er on his quest to collect a bunch of toys robots turns into something much more grim and dark...real life.  Yes, in the vain of Nick Hornby's novels ('About A Boy' &amp; High Fidelity') the shuffling of our main character through his daily events is all too real.  You get very soaked up into our main man and those he has befriended through out the years.  This includes his slob of a room mate, his reformed alcoholic younger brother Tar, his on-again, off-again girlfriend Evelyn, drug pushers, his boy hood friends and his dysfunctional dad.  I know, that seems like a lot, but James Gunn brilliantly crafts these characters into those people we can identify with.  Whether they are in our family, work, or neighborhood these are real people with real problems.<br />However, the main gist of the novel was the experiences that's shaped the depressing world for our main character, Bill.  The novel takes us through his 25th year with many chapters that serve as flashback sequences that describe his youth, from grade school through puberty.  Many of the events are truly funny and believable.  Nothing here within these pages is too outlandish, but in-between laughs, you will see the slow demise of Bill.  His first experimentation with drugs and alcohol, how he began to chain smoke, his failed attempts at love and meaningful employment.  Top this off with a friends suicide, and the struggling of acceptance from his indifferent parents paints a grim picture for Bill.  By the climax of the book all personal hell has broke loose for Bill, and the question remains on how his life will turn out.<br />Now, don't take this is as a depressing book.  While there are these overtones, the story moves along at a great pace, the situations are funny, and the characters are rich.  What stopped this short of 5 stars for me was the over abundance of swear words.  The same story could be told just as well with half the swearing.  And lastly the book ends in a cliffhanger like style, leaving the reader feeling slightly short changed after plugging away on such a great read and abruptly ending.ations are funny, and the characters are rich.

As a casual viewer of O'Reilly who finds his show very thought provoking and unusual amongst the myriad of cookie-cutter news magazines, I thought I'd give his book a shot.<br />Before I even began the book, I am constantly amazed by the sheer volume of feedback that Mr. O'Reilly receives from 180 degrees polar opposite sides of the political ideology spectrum.  One reviewer accuses O'Reilly of being a gun-toting Nazi, whereas the next will debase him as a card carrying member of the ACLU and liberal embracer.  The fact that so many people do not know which way he leans, goes to show how our ideologies are melded by sound bites that the news media chooses for us, and what our parents and friends influence us as.  This is where O'Reillys book challenges us as readers.  Suspend what you have heard and accepted from the masses and read the truth.  The truth that pulls no punches, is actually backed up by statistics and asks the questions you've always wanted to ask.<br />What O'Reilly does espouse is a return to an American life in which people take responsibility for their own actions and does not blame society or their upbringing as a scapegoat.<br />He points out the ludicrous and ridiculous matters in today's issues and wonders why we put up with it.  Someone has to hold these people accountable, so like it or not, O'Reilly has taken it upon himself to be the voice of the minority.<br />Why do the rich and politicians get away with things that the average Joe does not?  Why do spend money on silly programs, and who allowed this to happen?  Why do some criminals get better treatment than some honest people?  And more importantly, why has the average American come to accept this as the norm?<br />As I read this book, I truly believe he took a fair stance, criticizing both parties.  Perhaps some may think he is a bit more critical of the liberals, but at the time this book was being scripted, we had 8 years of the Clinton administration.<br />But don't fear that this book is heavy in politics.  Quite the contrary.  It is a fairly easy read, with chapters that are categorized nicely and are short.  I was able to finish this in just a few days.  Aside from politics, he takes on the rich and famous, family values, morals, ethics, greed, and happiness.  O'Reilly will be the 1st to admit he may not have all the answers, and may not even be right, but he is willing to question things that we no longer do.<br />Why then only 4 stars?  O'Reilly can go off on a tangent at times, and in some subject matter I felt got off track and took away from the chapter's main topic.  Also I found the first two-thirds more interesting than the last third.  At this point, I felt some dead space was being filled.  I would have liked some more substantive material than fluff.<br />He can be preachy at times, but the reader must accept this as just a person's point of view.  He also allows those that disagree with him some points in his book, and takes his own criticism quite well. I guarantee you will place this book down at times and be astonished at what goes on in some circles, and why this never makes the news.  There is no conservative or liberal agenda here to appeal to those ideologies, just pure common sense.....something America has recently put aside.s book is heavy in politics.  Quite the contrary.

US	52913038	R300KD4RR70UUB	0345435397	595671727	Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter (Star Wars)	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Both a new and not so new story, but good insight into Maul	I'll say I was really excited when I first heard about this book and eagerly awaited reading it.  Not to often does a book focus around a 'bad-guy' as the star, but you'll have to admit what allures us so much to these characters (Vader, Exar Kun, Sidious, etc..) is their ability to intrigue us about their motivations, their secrecy, and mysterious and commanding personas.  (The strong and silent types are always popular. See Boba Fett as an example).<br />The majority of the setting takes place on the Old Republic capital world of Coruscant just prior to events in Episode One. One of the Trade Federation member's defects and with him the horrific information about the ensuing blockade at Naboo.  Also his knowledge of the long forgotten Sith to be sold to the highest bidder, perhaps even the Jedi.  Of course, Lord Sidious cannot have this, and so dispatches Darth Maul to eliminate this Neimodian and all he comes in contact with.<br />Where the story has been told before lies in this: The 1st attempt of Maul to complete his mission is of course disrupted by the interference of others who get wind of what going on.  Enter Lorn Pavan (human with a distaste of Jedi and a love of money) and his comedic sidekick droid I5 (refurbished protocol droid with a sharp tongue).  Also throw in new Jedi padawan, Darsha, (friend of Obi Wan Kenobi) into the mix as her current mission also stumbles upon the ensuing pursuit by Maul.  Darsha, I5 and Pavan (an unlikely alliance brought together for survival) are now on the run through the underbelly of Coruscant's lower levels to the Jedi Council.  Here, twists and turns of action take place, and we begin to understand the character of Pavan.  Also we begin to feel for Darsha, and what it feels like to be on her first mission on as a fledgling Jedi.  Smiles and chuckles are supplied by the sarcastic I5.<br />Where the story is new:  I was really impressed in the detail and new locations with Coruscant.  Believed to be the crown jewel of the Old Republic, little has ever been discussed about the lower levels of the planet.  Here we see like any metropolis, seedy locations and species are abound all with their own agendas.  Survival is the key as is greed, and the danger lurks around all corners.  All species at this level are the underprivileged, trying to find a way out to the levels above.  New monsters are introduced as well as new insight into both the Jedi and Sith belief systems.<br />This is where Maul shines.  We now understand more about his origin, his training, his thoughts, and his hatred for the Jedi.  As a reader, I even began to respect him as a warrior through his discipline and ethics.  Nothing gets in his way, and he does not consider his shortcomings as failures, but as setbacks.  Failure is not in his vocabulary.<br />Anyway, the chase is on through the whole book and I was wondering how the author was going to pull it off.  The elimination of those characters I came to enjoy so much, for they cannot survive in order for the events of Episode One to take place.  I was pleasantly surprised on how this was handled, and a really neat *easter egg* appears on page 300 which explains all in a nice tight paragraph.<br />All in all, I found this novel very good with nonstop action and a great resolution that does not diminish Darth Maul in anyway or any of the supporting characters.  However, I will agree with one other reviewer that 'clich&eacute;' phrases are abundant in this novel and is probably the only irritating point within these pages.  Sometimes they sound downright silly even coming from a Jedi.the Old Republic, little has ever been discussed about the lower levels of the planet.

US	52913038	R333U7ZJASDUV4	0345428579	706445147	Balance Point (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 6)	Books	3	4	6	N	N	Great Dialogue, Good climax, yet lacks overall direction.	I read some of the other reviews here and noted that 4 and 5 stars were abundant, however, with a good conscious I had a hard time justifying those stars.  Novels in general should be exciting all the way through and cohesive, especially if it is part of an ongoing story-arc like the New Jedi Order, but I didn't find that the case here.<br />While Kathy Tyers may have mastered the art of character conversation (the dialogue sounds and feels very realistic, and seems like thought went into it), I found the first half of the novel lacking any major direction on how it all fits into the 'big picture'.<br />The story seems to revolve around the Vong eyeing the world of Duros for invasion.  Their ultimate goal here is to convert Duros into a staging ground to launch the final assault on the core worlds, namely Coruscant.  What is lacking in this book is how things are going in the rest of the universe.  Namely...where is the Imperial Remnant, the Jedi Academy, Kyp's dozen, Rouge squadron, Hapes Consortium, etc...,etc..?  Many of the aforementioned factions played some role in all previous novels but seemed somewhat absent here in this hardcover.<br />But the novels namesake 'Balance Point' seems to have multiple meanings here.  There is a situation that develops between Mara and Luke that many fans will find surprising yet questionable.  Again there is a balance that must be made between Leia and Han and if they can re-kindle their feelings for each other.  Also there is the balance between Duros technology and that of the Vong's bioware.  Kathy Tyers does a good job bringing these 'balance points' into view of the reader, however, I believe her biggest theme her was dealing with Jacen Solo.<br />Jacen Solo recently has questioned his role as a Jedi Knight in training, and if the Force is really necessary in dealing with certain situations.  He takes a vow of denying his jedi heritage for most of the novel and seems at constant war with himself or the correct or in-correct reasons and times to use the Force.  Is the Force manipulating him?  All this comes to a headway in the climax of the novel where Jacen must decide if and how he will use the Force, and if there are any ramifications.  At times, I felt that this could be the staging ground for Jacen to be tempted by the dark side.  Generally most stories show Anakin Solo as the one with the immense power, but never forget those other chracters who are just biding their time...Jacen really does struggle, and his power is revealed at one point<br />Again, we see the development of Jacen, Anakin, and Jaina as full fledged characters in the Star Wars universe.  And in this novel we do see some new worlds and species, but alas, I was a little concerned that there is a whole war going on all over, and this book strictly focused on events at Duros, and only at the end of the novel were Vong intentions made clear as to what this story was trying to accomplish.ct reasons and times to use the Force.

Book  six of the Left Behind series is definitely one of the better ones so far.  Despite the sometimes sappy dialogue, many of the characters are fleshed out, and even expand in ways that weren't expected from the previous novels.  That is to say some of the main characters core beliefs and faith are put to the test as events that culminate at the Global Community Gala in Jerusalem towards the books climax.<br />It is three years into the tribulation and the 4th trumpet has been sounded.  What ensues throw what's left of the worlds population into further chaos and despair.  Many more convert to Christ, while many others blatantly choose the other side, and the death toll of familiar characters increases.  However, be encouraged that new characters are being introduced, which keeps parts of this novel fresh since this tale has already spanned 5 previous books.<br />One of the major developments in `Assassins' is what becomes of Rayford Steele.  He has lost family, his second wife, his friends, and now believes he is losing his grip on sanity.  His exploits carry him all over the world in search of Hattie Durham, and often places him in exciting and adrenaline pumping scenarios.  And sometimes the outcome is not what was desired.  Clearly if one figure changes the most in this book it is Rayford, and opens a whole new dynamic spin on him that will have Christians thinking.<br />As far as the rest of the crew is concerned, not too much happens other than that of Hattie and David.  Hattie appears to have gone AWOL as David finds himself getting deeper and deeper within the bowels of the Global Community and the reaches of Nicolae Carpathia (the Antichrist).  Oh, and Chaim's internal battle over his own faith climaxes at the Global Gala.<br />Not only is this chapter in the series much more action packed, but events become much more grim and closer together.  The one world religion is dealt with by Nicolae, as are the two witnesses at the Wailing Wall.  Peter the Second finds himself in a situation manipulated by Nicolae and there is no easy escape.  The depravity of the world's citizens becomes more engulfed in sin, and it is really scary to read about these events.  The most chilling event I found in the book was with Nicolae himself.  We catch him in a very short passage praying to Lucifer, thus confirming himself as the Antichrist, and the few words he speaks will send chills down your spine.  Really looking forward to the next one.d finds himself in a situation manipulated by Nicolae and there is no easy escape.

Funny Hutt's	Agents of Chaos is the follow up to Hero's Trial in the New Jedi Order series that began with Vector Prime.  This installment picks up where Hero's Trial ended and made for a very entertaining and action packed story in current timeline of the Star Wars Universe.<br />Again, like all novels within the New Jedi Order time frame, the New Republic is at war with an extra-galaxy force known as the Yuuzhan Vong.  Where as Vector Prime painted a very grim future for the New Republic, the follow up novels (in my opinion) softened up on the ferocity of the Vong.  However,  author James Luceno re-invigorates the strength and evil of the Vong as they slowly but surely take a more prominent foothold in the Star Wars Universe.  By the end of this novel, we see the Vong double their efforts and with some success inch ever closer to the core worlds.  Of course the various races and alliances within the Republic are now thrown into Chaos.  No one trusts the government, the Jedi are questioned, the Hutt's are made to be betrayers to the Republic and hopes are quickly dashed out.<br />The primary characters here are Han and his new Ryn friend, Droma.  Their escapades make for a real good ride reminiscent of Indiana Jones, James Bond, and the original New Hope action.  Leia is also here as she pleads her case to her former suitor Isolder and the Hapes Consortium (from `The Courtship of Princess Leia').  Though Luke is present, he is scarcely mentioned as the focus is shifted to other Jedi; namely Kyp Duron, Wurth Skidder, Jacen and Anakin Solo.  Kyp continues his aggressive style where as Jacen and Anakin question their loyalties to the spirituality of being a Jedi Knight and their role in the Force.  One character, previously thought dead makes a return, but noticeable are the absences of Lando, Ackbar, R2, Jaina Solo, Mara Jade and any Imperials.<br />The author did include a new spin was very enjoyable to read...that of the Hutt's.  For the Hutt's play both sides of the war, for obvious reasons and it is amusing to read their takes on the New Republic and the Vong.  Sometimes comedic in nature, they are the master manipulators, and also the sniveling wimps who hide behind their hired hands.  Many plot twists center around the Hutt's and their decisions, and we have great insight about their culture because of this.<br />Then there is the rift slowly forming between Han and Leia.  Both silently blame each other for the division that has come between them which lends to credibility that they are human, and even strong relationships in the Star Wars universe are put to the test.  You actually feel for both of them.<br />The one odd thing I always note in any SW novels is the creation or revelation of a new super weapon.  In this case it is Centerpoint Station around Coreilla.  HHHmmmm, we have had 2 death Stars, (really 3 from the Maw Installation), the Sun Crusher, the Dark Saber, the World Devastators, now Centerpoint.  Each always promising to be more powerful than the last.  When will it end?<br />The closing chapter made for some very interesting revelations as the war continues.  Exactly who is pulling whose strings, and who is for the Republic and who is for the Vong.

Where the 1st two novels were closely tied, this 3rd venture placed a whole new spin and direction from its predecessors. Overall I think it can be said Preserver was the overall story here where Specter and Dark Victory were only novels to introduce characters and political climate of the time.  The main gist is the reader discovers that the mirror universe was more or less an accident, and that an ancient race known as the Preservers have been manipulating key people in our universe (mainly James T. Kirk of course among a few others) to lead them to administer events that will result in the eventual destruction of the mirror universe. However, Kirk's nemesis Tiberius has other plans. Soon our main characters are in doubt on just who are the decision makers and who can be trusted in the Federation.  The best aspects of the book is a new approach in thinking about science fiction. William Shatner and co-writers introduce us to psychohistory...a very interesting concept. The mystery of the Preservers and the shadow government within the Federation (Project Sign) unfold masterfully and at a good pace. The settings are described very well and the characters are handles in a believable way....all except Tiberius.  The cons are the hokiness. The beginning of the book pits Kirk against Tiberius in a somewhat silly confrontation that only William Shatner could think up. After this conflict resolves, Tiberius is almost sedate through the remainder of the book and even has a change of heart if you will at the novel's climax. The Tiberius that appeared in the Original Series and the following novels would not have acted this way at the end. Also there is a tragedy that involves Kirk's new wife Telaini. It was pretty clich&eacute; and you could see the outcome a mile away. This 'situation' has been done to death in many sci-fi novels...nothing new here.  The last 2 chapters were both fun and confusing. In one chapter we see Z. Cochrane and Lily (from the movie: 1st Contact) go over the events of 1st Contact and Warp technology with reference to the Borg. Why this was in the novel is beyond me other that to sew the seeds for an upcoming novel involving time travel. The last chapter (an epilogue) involves a now grown Melmon (see Specter) reflecting on the house that Jim Kirk built on Chal and looking to the stars. This reference takes place in the future, beyond the resolution in this book. So in two chapters, you witness both a past event and a future event that has no connection to overall story in Preserver, but fun to read anyway.last 2 chapters were both fun and confusing.

Why this was in the novel is beyond me other that to sew the seeds for an upcoming novel involving time travel. The last chapter (an epilogue) involves a now grown Melmon (see Specter) reflecting on the house that Jim Kirk built on Chal and looking to the stars. This reference takes place in the future, beyond the resolution in this book. So in two chapters, you witness both a past event and a future event that has no connection to overall story in Preserver, but fun to read anyway.	2001-01-30

Okay, let me tell you straight up.  I own the game and it is worthy of 5 stars.  I will sit and play for hours wondering where the time went.  The manual included with the game is somewhat vague however in many of the games features and areas, so I had decided to buy the Strategy Guide by Prima.<br />The strong points of the Strategy Guide are as follows: 1) Yes, it does offer you a complete list of all the WWF Superstars (even the hidden ones) in great color and a complete list of all their moves along with their 'specials', and 2) Interesting factoids on each Superstar, kinda like some trivia on each.<br />HOWEVER, there is very little strategy (if any) discussed in this guide.  The first 4 pages tells you about the type of matches and what you can select, but never once offers advice on which wrestler is suited for which type of match.  There is NO advice on successful tips to win a cage or ladder match.  The advice that is given is either common sense or spelled out clearly in the original game manual, so there is nothing new gained by the purchase of this guide.<br />I thought the most interesting quote on the back cover of the guide was: &quot;Learn how to get the most for your buck at the Smackdown Mall&quot;.  I challenge anyone out there to tell me what page, if any page actually discusses one iota of strategy at the Smackdown Mall.  The best info it gives is that you can buy weapons, hidden characters and moves.  Well, no kidding!!  That is not what I call strategy.<br />If you want to know the moves of a Superstar, then this is the book.<br />If you want a book that discusses which wrestler is more apt to perform better against a rival, how to distribute skill points, how to earn more money, how to recover energy and save stamina, how to avoid certain angles (based on decisions you make, or whether you win or lose a match), how to use weapons effectively, how to be successful in a ladder or cage match, how to maximize your wins in a tag team match, how to perform cheats (I know, not really a strategy), how many matches are needed to win a specific belt, etc...then THIS IS NOT THE BOOK!! Save your (money).o perform cheats (I know, not really a strategy), how many matches are needed to win a specific belt, etc...then THIS IS NOT THE BOOK!! Save your (money).	2000-12-18

As always in Tom Clancy novels, they start a little slow but always return a real page turner by the end.  However, The Bear and the Dragon was a little slower than usual for most of Clancy's other novels.  It is amazing the grasp he has on current technology and the way other cultures think and operate when it comes to American ideology.  In this respect, Clancy does a fabulous job of letting the reader in on how the Chinese Politburo thinks as it regards the its place in the world and how it measures up to other super powers.  It is equally interesting to see how world communities act together and depend on each other as far as gold, oil, money, technology, and religion are concerned.  Clancy is well apt to make the reader think about all these things without shoving them down our collective throats.<br />It is also equally fascinating how Clancy can make the most mundane and average events you normally wouldn't blink an eye at play such a major catalyst on how quickly the world can be thrown into chaos!<br />In addition to the overall storyline of the former Soviet Union being stalked and invades by an overzealous China, there are numerous subplots: The death of a pimp in Red Square (was he really the target?), a former TRW programmer redesigning missile guidance systems, the death of a Baptist and catholic minister in China that spun out of control, the return of Rainbow Six, and more.<br />A few new characters were introduced that you want to see developed in future novels as well as some subtle hints of future plot lines makes the reader salivate for the next one.<br />The only drawbacks I had towards this novel which refrained me from giving it 5 stars was that the climax was straight out of James Bond, fun for the ride, but you had to suspend reality for a bit.  Not that it is a let down, for I was enthralled and excited (which a novel should do), but perhaps in a more believable way. Also I noticed that Mr. Clancy is also getting more liberal in his 'adult' language as his novels continue.  AS secular language always has its time and place, it just seemed a bit more peppered this time out.ncy is also getting more liberal in his 'adult' language as his novels continue.

Book #10, if you will, is a parallel novel to that of #9.  That is to say the majority of events that take place here are in the same time frame as the previous novel, but with the other half of the New Frontier cast.  What one will not find here is any mention of 2nd Officer Elizabeth Shelby, or major space faring battles. A bit of a let down if you are looking for strange new worlds.....<br />Like it's sister novel, the original cast of New Frontier is split into smaller original stories, each one revolving around either one or two of these characters.  The most dynamic of these stories is a really richly crafted tale of Dr. Selar and Hermat Lieutenant Commander Burgoyne and the fate of their new child.  The reader is exposed to both sides of parenthood and how best to raise a child with two different cultures.  The baby Xyon, though Vulcan in appearance carries some of the latent qualities of the Hedrmat species and these slowly manifest over time.  How Selar deals with these changes is a journey through re-self-discovery.  She believes Xyon should be brought up in the Vulcan tradition, but events will soon challenge her first impressions.  On the other hand, Burgoyne hirself believes that Xyon should be able to express itself, and what better way than for Burgoyne and Selar to become a family.  This struggle leads both back to Vulcan where T'Pau and the Vulcan justice system decides the ultimate fate.  Or does it? A great surprise appearance from a well established Trek character makes Selar face her inner most fears.  Also a `gay' Vulcan debuts here and it is interesting to see the authors take on sexuality in the Trek Universe, which generally hasn't been touched by other authors.<br />Robin and her Mother Morgan travel to Risa, the pleasure planet, where they venture on a vacation that they both help will bring them closer together.  But once there, both women meet new love interests who have their own Agenda.  Is Robin over Si Cwan?  This story furthers the development of Morgan.  She is no longer the litlle girl that she was portrayed in the previous novels, but comes into her own here.  Morgan also displays a new side which even adds more mystery to this character, wanting the reader to desire more about her in future installments.  Also a deeper story opens up in which the miracle worker, Scott Montgomery lends his hand to.  Scott's charm is still there and he has some humorous tales to tell.<br />Finally, Si Cwan and Kalinda make a surprise appearance at the end that begins to tie up the cliffhanger that they were involved in book #9.  I'm sure all this will come to a head in the hard cover, \\"Restoration\\".<br />Overall this book was much better executed than #9 was, and made much more sense in the larger scope of things in the New Frontier universe.development of Morgan.

For all those readers of the New Jedi Order series that began with Vector Prime, many will recognize that Han Solo has been somewhat absent from all the other novels that had followed this new direction in the Star Wars universe.  He has only been briefly around since the death of Chewbacca and this has allowed authors to invent new characters and breath depth to many others that were previously second stringers or were only supporting characters in earlier exploits.<br />However, for those that missed your favorite Corellian, he's back, but not exactly the same scoundrel that the princess was so coy about.  This novel explores the pain of Solo's loss and a rejection and rebirth of his core beliefs.  I thought the novel was a bit slow in the beginning when it came to the memorial service back on Chewie's home planet.  Han's feelings were re-hashed over and over again for what seems to be filler material, and you get to feel that Han is now whining.  It is understandable to a point, but I soon tired of the lengthy flashbacks.  I felt his treatment to Leia and Luke was a bit out of character, but events that eventually unfold probably allow for this justification.<br />As the story revolves mainly around Han, he finds himself in trouble as always, and it is an entertaining read as he moves from one situation to the next.  What he does discover is a situation that places him in the same shoes as his son Anakin, and for the first time really comes to terms with dealing with Anakin as he relates to Chewie's death.<br />A new character is introduced into this story and he seems like a perfect fit as the new partner for Han.  Though he may not replace Chewie immediately, the seeds are sown for a great pairing down the line.  This character is very rich in depth and was written very well.  He displays a sense of humor that compliments Han's dry wit and sarcasm.<br />Some interesting turns take place in the New Republic government, somewhat reminiscent of the Empire as it came to power first in politics prior to its militaristic stance that the Rebellion fought against. Other notes: C-3PO contemplates his mortality.  Lando is absent.  Very little is dealt with the Solo children.<br />Finally the Vong....I feel that they (as a whole) who were described as an all powerful force to fear from the 1st few books, has suddenly became not only passive, but softened up.  I was really excited about their potential as a new threat, but it looks as if they aren't so bad after all.  A real shame if the initial intent of the New Jedi Order was to add shake things up and bring back some fun filled tension to a huge galaxy.  Hopefully the next books will re-focus this effort.  Overall, it was a good book for Han Solo fans.me to power first in politics prior to its militaristic stance that the Rebellion fought against. Other notes: C-3PO contemplates his mortality.

It's pretty hard to argue that `The New Frontier' series by Peter David is one of the most innovative inductions into the Star Trek Franchise.  His characters and situations are very energetic and fun and is a great change of pace from those characters we are all too familiar with in movies and syndicated shows.<br />Requiem, the 9th book in this stand alone series had high expectations for me but fell flat.  Mr. David is a very talented writer and I truly enjoyed the 1st 8 adventures of the Excalibur team.  There was a great cliffhanger at the end of 8 which left us fans salivating for the newest installment.  How did the Excalibur end?  What would become of the crew?  You anticipated that perhaps a new ship was in order, or that the characters would all return and band together for a new adventure....maybe even look for McKenzie.<br />But this doesn't happen.  Instead we move forward a period of time and spend the first few chapters watching our characters reflect on their last mission and previous captain in a bar.  While the lamenting may be good, it was a bit overdone, and we all know the Excalibur will probably be back in a future book.<br />This novel is complete filler material.  There is no overall story here or goal.  Instead Peter David takes half of the characters we know and assigns them shorts stories that changes with every chapter.  Perhaps will enjoy some extra character development, but this is a much different approach from what most Trek fans expect.<br />First up is  Si Cwan and his sister Kalinda, who are off to find the murderer of their beloved teacher. The end is never resolved but will continue in #10 I presume.  Secondly, Kebron and McHenry form an unusual pair of undercover Starfleet operatives who 1st assignment is to bust some unruly cadets in a throwback to a humorous X-Files episode.  I missed the chemistry between Si Cwan and Kebron.  The only good part of this story was that there are some more mysteries that surround McHenry, and they run into the prankster `Q' who as always adds fun dialogue to whomever he addresses.  Finally, the most riveting story with a good twist near the end is that of Soleta.  We learn a great deal about her origin, and I personally think that this could be an expanded stand alone novel all by itself.  I think this was the saving grace for this book.<br />So you can expect more solo stories in the next installment with the following: Robin, Morgan, Burgoyne, Selar, etc.  As I have already began reading 10 as I write this review, I can say that I am finding it much better than this one.hey run into the prankster `Q' who as always adds fun dialogue to whomever he addresses.

You speak to him, but he babbles on  incoherently in rhymes about things from the past, but you are more puzzled  on how he got out here to begin with.  You take him to the hospital where  he soon dies in a spastic fit.  Enter the local police trying to figure out  what happened....<br />This is how Timeline opens, with a strong X-Files  mystery case.  However, this is where the mystery stops, and the story  shifts both locals and characters.  We now learn that billionaire Doniger  owns ITC Corp., a company who secretly developed a 'sorta' time machine  based on quantum theorems that Einstein and Stephan Hawkings would be proud  of.  However, you don't go back in time in the traditional sense, but  emerge into a parallel universe at a different time in equivalent to our  history.  Mr. Crichton's strengths lies in the description of this science  which is easy for the reader to understand and makes it very plausible.  His research into medieval France is also very exceptional.  A few diagrams  are scattered throughout the book that also help the reader.<br />Anyway, the  three main characters are introduced to us and by all accounts are very  typical and genric for these type of stories.  They are archeologists  working on a castle site in France that ITC just happens to be funding, and  as the story soon unfolds, ITC *lost* someone back in time.  ITC, with  Doniger (a very shadowy figure who only has his own interests and agenda in  mind) sends the three back to medieval France with a few companions.  Of  course they emerge in the middle of a war and all hell breaks loose where  they are on the run for the next 48 hours.  Their mission: find the missing  professor, bring him back without changing history, and without getting  hurt.  Of course this isn't going to happen.  Nonetheless, the story is  very entertaining and very educational.  There is a lot of action  reminiscent of Indiana Jones, but much of the story was way to predictable.  You could see the ending a mile away.<br />What really bothered me was not  only the obvious predicaments and resolutions, but there were some dangling  plotlines  from the beginning that were never resolved.  Examples: What  ever happened to cop who was investigating the death of the strange man  from the desert?  What ever happened to the doctor that performed the  autopsy?  What ever happened to Doniger's PR woman and right hand man?  Why  did no-one ever question or put their foot down to Doniger?<br />Lastly,  Doniger created this whole technology so he could build very accurate theme  parks, yet he had made other creations (see universal language translator)  which probably made him even richer and less dangerous, but he chooses to  do nothing with it.<br />It was a fun story with some good technical and  historical lessons in it, but otherwise somewhat shallow in depth and  surprises.professor, bring him back without changing history, and without getting  hurt.

One of the characters realizes that she is a lesbian, while  two other characters share an intimate homosexual experience.  Why the  author felt that these needed to be included are beyond me for they do  nothing to advance the story. There are some comedic situations that are  amusing, while other events are down right evil and chilling.<br />As in the  first novel, Thomas Harlan continues a fabulous job in description of the  political climate, the physical layout of the land, and is very rich in  detail.  Almost too much detail.  There are a few battle scenes that are  very exciting and filled with adrenaline.  The climatic battle with Prince  Maxian was a real page turner and was very stepped in magic and the  supernatural.  Almost read like a good Star Wars battle.  On the downside  though, a few characters that were dead or thought to be dead, re-appear in  this installment.<br />The biggest problem I had with this book and the last  is its complexity.  Mr. Harlan truly is writing an Epic here, and unless  you are skilled to keep track of dozens of characters and plotlines you may  want to think twice about undertaking this.  Now two books into  (theoretically 1/2 way), I am still having a problem seeing what the main  goal of the story is.  It is basically Persia vs. Rome, and roughly three  to four factions fighting for supremacy.  Would have liked to see a bit  more magic in this novel.<br />In the end, the premise is good, the  characters and detail rich.

This third book in the Howard Moon Deer series deserves 3.5 stars.<br />I find it very interesting that this novel is billed as a `Howard Moon Deer'  novel, when in fact the character Moon Deer makes up one half of a the  detective team of Wilder &amp; Associate.  Throughout the novel, while  Howard does play an integral part of the unfolding mystery, it is his  mentor and boss, retired CA. policeman, Jack Wilder who has just as much  action.  Even more so, it is Jack Wilder that the P.I. firm is named after,  and it is Jack that pretty much is part of the climax and resolution of the  overall mystery here.<br />I purchased this book for its somewhat synonymous  genre of modern Native American mysteries as Tony Hillerman would write  about in his Jim Chee &amp;  Joe Leaphorn novels.  Whereas Hillerman mixes  in traditional Native American culture, history, religion, and tradition  into his novels author Robert Westbrook barely touched on any of this in  this novel.  Actually our star, Howard Moon Deer, is very educated.  He can  speak French and English quite well and attended Ivy League schools.  He  often comments on how far removed he is from `traditional' Native American  life as he has mastered the yuppie slang, has a taste for Caf&eacute; Aulaits and  wine, and is involved with an equally educated white woman.<br />So what part  makes this a southwestern novel?  Well, events take place in the fictional  town of San Geronimo, New Mexico.  The author compares San Geronimo to a  smaller scale Santa Fe and Taos, as it is centered around an artist  community/mentality and tourism.  Sure there are some references to Native  American culture, but not many.<br />The story was nothing new.  Current  mystery revolves around a recent murder and a stolen Georgia O'Keefe  painting from years past.  As the mystery unfolds, we learn of another  murder and mystery tied to it from the past as well, but conveniently all  the players from back then are still present today.  Overall, the story was  entertaining, and you really get interested in the cast of characters.  The  characters are pretty well defined and all have apparent motivations and  definitions that make them fun and quirky.  However, the climax was a  slight let down as everything happened too fast and wasn't overly exciting  or action packed.  It was a fairly easy read, as I finished the 297 pages  in less than 4 days, and I would definitely read the next one just so I can  see the resolution of a few interesting non-essential story threads that  presented themselves throughout the tale.  Some of these seem to dictate  the actions of Howard, his girlfriend, and Jack and the way they perceive  each other.<br />In closing, Robert Westbrook has some very good characters  in Howard Moon Deer and Jack Wilder, but I don't think this story utilized  their full potential.the story was  entertaining, and you really get interested in the cast of characters.

An actor turned novelist is hard enough, but when the character and the story you tell is about your TV persona and it is your first attempt you  would think it impossible to craft a likeable tale.  Not so for Andrew  Robinson.  As a second string character and your favorite Cardassian tailor  who began to gain in notoriety far to late in the Deep Space 9 series,  Garak is an intriguing, mysterious, and likeable addition to the cast.<br />A Stitch In Time was a masterful crafting of the character and filled in  many of the blanks that have been asked over the years in regards to how  Garak came into his position aboard DS9 and his role in the Obsidian Order.  Not once does the author break character, but only enhances it and made  Garak even more believable than before.  You not only read about his  triumphs over the years, but also his many, many setbacks.  Did Garak ever  find true peace before, during, or after the wars?  Who were his parents?  Did he ever fall in love?  Where did he 1st meet Dukat?  How did he come to  the Obsidian Order and DS9?  What were his first impressions of Odo, Kira,  and Quark?  All these are answered here.<br />The book itself is a bit odd to  explain in layout.  Garak is more or less writing a letter to Dr. Bashir  after the Dominion war has ended, but it contains journal entries and  personal account written in both the 1st and 3rd person over the history of  his life.  The book is divided into three main time frames, or significant  events in the life of Garak.  1) His life as a youth and an introduction to  his parents, his friends, his way of upbringing and his outlook to Bajor  and the Cardassian way of life.  2) Training in a military academy where  what he learns in betrayal, friendship, combat, survival and love take him  to the Obsidian Order.  3) Events that 1st place him on DS9 under Dukat,  then under Federation control, and then back to Cardassia after the  war.<br />There really is no conclusion as he reveals the events of his life  so far are still playing out and new avenues will be discovered.  The book  is more on the spirit of `humanity' and what he identifies in himself is  not much unlike those people on Bajor, or those in the Federation.  The  novel is funny at times, and gives a great narrative of the Cardassian way  of life.  You will appreciate them much more and get to understand them  deeper than you ever would have in the TV series.vents of his life  so far are still playing out and new avenues will be discovered.

I realize that David Sedaris books are supposed to be `really' funny, and I consider myself to have a great sense of humor, but overall I found `Me Talk Pretty One Day' amusing at best.  In this best selling book, the  reader is exposed to a collection of short stories that take on a humorous  spin of mundane topics, or everyday subjects that the Sedaris family has  placed their own `unique and warped' spin on.<br />Though most stories were  entertaining, I often asked that though many of these snippets of Mr.  Sedaris's life were plausible, some seem to be somewhat exaggerated or  embellished.  Perhaps that is the authors attempt to really try to make  something funny, which ordinarily isn't.  Now, don't get me wrong, there  are some funny stories.  The book is worth it's price in three or four of  these snapshots: \\"I'll eat what he's wearing\\", \\"Big Boy\\", and the one that  had me rolling on the floor crying to catch my breath \\"You can't kill the  Rooster.\\"  This last story about his younger brother is movie  material!<br />The collection overall covers a wide variety of subjects,  however, there seem to be two recurring theme's that I observed.  First, a  decent portion of the book is devoted to his experiences living in France.  Though one can make the argument that this book is about his life and it's  funny moments, and he did actually live in France; for someone who has  never been there to identify French absurdity I found myself saying \\"Oh,  another story France, again\\".  The redeeming aspect for me here was the  story about learning French with a bunch of students (characters in their  own right), taught by a dictatorial and stereotypical rude French  teacher.<br />Secondly, the author seems to have what I would consider some  issues of reservation of his life and choices.  Autobiographical in nature,  the stories often reflect the author's acknowledgement of his low  self-worth.  He often talks about how many deplorable jobs he has had, how  cheap his father is, how smart he isn't, his life with an alcoholic mother,  how he got mixed up into drugs and just shuffled through life.  However, he  takes these normally depressing attributes and attempts to shroud them in  humor, hoping that the reader can look past these events on the surface and  praise Mr. Sedaris for his wit.  Though this does work at times, I wasn't  sure whether to laugh or feel sorry for him at times.<br />I hope I am not  giving an impression that this is a bad book.  It is not.  It is funny and  an easy read.  But it was more `amusing' than `hilarious' in which most  people would expect.her is, how smart he isn't, his life with an alcoholic mother,  how he got mixed up into drugs and just shuffled through life.

Ruin is the follow up to Onslaught, and even though the story continues, the author's style and focus seem to have shifted somewhat.<br />Whereas Onslaught (and Vector Prime) portrayed the Vong as a super powerful force  that would even shake the Empire and Rebellion alike to its core, Mr.  Stackpole tends to soften them up a bit here in this novel.  By a fluke the  Jedi discover a weak link in the Vong armor and soon plans are set in  motion to exploit it.  However, the Vong figure this out as well and decide  to make the climatic battle at Ithor.<br />Though the action was fast paced  throughout, I was a little surprised on how quickly the Vong seemed to lose  their edge and tenacity at Ithor.  What was more surprising is the Imperial  Remnant makes their debut as an ally to the New Republic (who would have  ever of thought?).  Mr. Stackpole clearly defines a new breed of Imperials,  as a new generation (other than Admiral Palleon) have a slightly more  liberal view of the galaxy than those who served the Emperor.  An  interesting debate takes place near the new Imperial home world of Bastion  as the Moff's discuss their future and their involvement in the  war.<br />There is further character development in Jacen, Anakin and Jaina,  as now their new roles in the galaxy are shaping up.  They clearly now have  their own identities and paths before them, all different.  What was  interesting to see was that each Solo child had made a new friend in the  book that clearly balanced them both as Jedi and humans.  They learn  valuable lessons from those they would least expect.<br />However, this book  was clearly that of Jedi, Corran Horn.  Stackpole's creation from 'I, Jedi'  takes a front and center role here and even the climax of the book centers  about his actions.  But, despite Jedi Horn's outcome, there does not seem  to be a clear cut ending in this book.  Stackpole once again seems to be  laying even a broader foundation of things yet to come in this era of The  New Jedi Order series.<br />What is missing in this novel to hardcore fans is  once again: a brief glimpse of Han, C-3PO and Leia.  No Lando, little of R2  and others we have come to recognize.  On the flipside lesser characters  are coming to the forefront in Ganner, Palleon, Mara Jade, Kyp Durron, and  a few Bothans.<br />But Luke fans have no fear...Luke is here, though an  interesting dilemma seems to be forming with the new generation of Jedi.  Luke has tried so hard to bring a new Jedi order to the galaxy he efforts  some think may be spread too thin, and it begins to show in the graduates  and students of the Jedi academy.  Some of their actions are in question,  and the New Republic government is starting to fear them and question their  agenda.  What doesn't help is there are a few clear cut examples of Jedi  walking the line of the dark side, and Luke is aware of this and wonders  what his next actions are.  Will some of these Jedi soon flip as the Vong  war escalates?<br />Finally, there is a new player in that of the Vong.  Clearly, by novel's end you begin to learn that yet another Vong Leader is  behind the scenes pulling strings of the Vong on the forefront who think  they are in control.  This mysterious warrior is yet to be revealed until  other novels down the road.he  New Jedi Order series.<br />What is missing in this novel to hardcore fans is  once again: a brief glimpse of Han, C-3PO and Leia.

Lacks some details	Prima's guide for Pokemon is pretty darn good.  The layout is done nicely and explantions of the different parts of the game are done well.  Maps and key figures are identified and the screen captures are nice and  clear.<br />Out of the 226 cards that can be collected in this game, Prima  does an excellent job in cataloging each one by power and energy type.  They also give very helpful pro's and con's on each card and tell you which  ones are worth having, and a few that you probably don't want to use in  your deck..  An intersting side note:  Prima also gives the origin on many  of the card, that is, if they debuted in Japan or America first and when.  Also, unique to the Gameboy are special cards only obtained in the Gameboy  version.<br />There are some strategies on how to build certains decks that  will aid you in defeating some of the club masters, and a nice feature is  Prima identifies the club master and other boss decks so you can build a  great deck before you encounter them.<br />The one drawback I see with this  guide is the lack of card combinations descriptions.  Though there are  some, there are a lot more to be discovered that could have been written  about.  Also, if they can break down the decks of the club masters and  bosses, they could have also done the same for other NPC's within the game,  but give very vague guidelines/hints on most of the NPC's<br />Overall, a good  buy for the price.	2000-07-01

Jefferson Parker's `The Red Light' I found, was a return to classic mystery writing for this author.  Unlike his previous two novels that were much darker and horrific in terms of the crimes, this had a lighter tone  and actually really had me guessing all the way towards the end.  I have  read all of Mr. Parker's novels and he had a tendency to reveal the  perpetrators about half way through, and it was up to the good guys to  catch them.  The Red Light revolves around two mysteries actually: the  current murder of a 19 year old escort, and the mysterious death of a  blackmailing prostitute some 20 years earlier who had connections in local  politics and law enforcement.  This one, however, had many twists, and  though it was obvious from the beginning that the main suspect was setup, I  couldn't figure out who was the real bad guy was or the angle.  Interesting  the development of theories based on evidence and forensics as they  develop. Great job.<br />Also, unlike other of Mr. Parker's novels, this had a  returning character in Merci Rayborn.  It is now a few years after the  events from `The Blue Hour' and Merci has tried to move on in her life.  We  pick up at this point and learn how much more of an isolationist she has  become.  If there is any dark tone in this book at all, it is Merci's  outlook on life through her own eyes.  She refers to events that happened  in The Blue Hour, and you can see how her character has been altered from  that time.<br />The story's settings themselves should be familiar to Parker's  readers; actual locals in Orange County, CA.  The murder takes place in  Dana Point, the sheriff's are out of Laguna Beach, and the characters  frequent Tustin, Irvine, San Juan Capistrano and others.  There is also a  history lesson in this book as Merci also tries to solve a crime from 20+  years earlier.  How times have changed, not only in politics and attitude  but landscapes as well.  Little does Merci know at first that the two  crimes are connected, and the players are much closer than she ever would  have thought.<br />Though this story definitely revolves around Merci, she is  somewhat balanced from her sometimes partner, Zamora.  He is an older  officer that has his own problems going on that he must deal with, but they  end up helping each other in more than just solving crimes.  They learn  from each other's examples and Merci benefits from this much more.<br />The  ending was good, very realistic in that even though it was a happy ending,  the reader must ask \\"Was it a happy ending after all?\\"  I truly enjoyed the  guesswork here.are connected, and the players are much closer than she ever would  have thought.<br />Though this story definitely revolves around Merci, she is  somewhat balanced from her sometimes partner, Zamora.

Jim Lehrer has scripted a beautiful and emotional tale about a WWII American B-29 pilot coming to grips with horrid memories that he would like to have forgotten over the  past 50 years and his ability to forgive.<br />Quincy Watson, known as Big Red  during his runs over Japan today is a fragile shell of what he could have  been.  Today as a retired Methodist Bishop, he `accidentally' runs into the  man who tortured him so many years ago in a POW camp.  The man known as  `Hyena' killed many of Watson's compatriots in numerous and sickening ways,  the whole time playing mind games with Watson.  But Watson didn't escape  easily after the war.  His leg is maimed, his reproductive organs  shattered, he is numb to death, and hate begins to bubble down inside.  This is where Quincy spends the next 50 years recovering, an emotional  hurdle to overcome, where religion is discovered and forgiveness is a key  element.  But his life is put to a new test in his 70's, as the world as he  knew it was over, a shocking sight open up all wounds.  What do you say to  the man who controlled whether you lived or died if you bumped into him  today?<br />The story is amazing, simply put.  It is a fairly easy read, but  the images and descriptions of the atrocities of what happens in the POW  camps will leave the reader not only speechless but asking themselves of  their own capacity for forgiveness.  What is equally presented here is the  opinions and perspectives of the Japanese.  Is it really that cut and dry  for Americans?  I challenge you to read the side of the Japanese mentality  and you may learn more about yourself than you thought you knew.<br />There is  a `great surprise' that happens about half way through the book that I  promise changes everything, but does not detract from the story, but rather  adds a new challenging dynamic to it.  This is not just a story you read  about an old American Pilot and his Japanese nemesis, this is a story that  really takes you on an emotional roller coaster and will hit you in the  deepest psychological, religious, and moral ways.  You don't even have to  be of that generation.  Jim Lehrer delivers an accurate account of human  behavior in the worst conditions, and yet teaches us about love, and  getting over horrific events and how we deal with them.

But Greg Bear's novel rises from the murkiness and shine's upon it's  own.<br />What Greg Bear has done here is introduce us to classic science  fiction story telling.  The aliens are quite different than most `bi-pedal'  creatures we are so familiar with.  Mr. Bear also goes far in detailing  different environments, culture's, and philosophies, making us realize that  we have been reading so many over-hashed similar stories that we forget how  to use our imagination.  Not here, we rediscover strange new worlds!<br />Call  it Phantom Menace 1.5, this novel takes place 3 years after Episode I.  The  focus of this novel is around Anakin and Obi-Wan, and not just in their  traditional Master/Padawan role, but as friends and mutual respect for each  other.  Obi-Wan, more than ever before senses the un-measurable power  within young Anakin and takes great pride in molding him in his adolescent  life to being a Jedi.  He often reflects on the teachings of his former  Master Qui-Gon and see much of his former self in young Anakin and thus  learns to appreciate the teachings of patience and understanding of all  things alien.  Obi-Wan, for all intents becomes a father figure.<br />Anakin  is a different story.  We clearly see how far this boy has progressed over  the last few years.  It is amazing on what we as the reader can see just  below the surface of this boys psyche and can understand on how one day he  will become Dark Lord of the Sith. He skills develop daily, as does his  aggressiveness.  He still has the wonderment of a child, all the questions,  but his yearning for adventure and his lack of patience `will' be his  eventual un-doing.<br />A surprise character takes on a semi-major roll here.  We are introduced to a young W. Tarkin as we know one day will become the  1st Grand Moff from `A New Hope'.  There is great insight to his character  here as we learn about his youth at the Republic Academy, how he has made  some `political changes' as of late and strives for a New Order, one in  which Human's will dominate the galaxy.  These all lend to the ideas of  Chancellor Palpatine here and how this young Officer wants to make an  impression on the political regime that is slowly forming.<br />We see all see  characters such as Mace Windu, (briefly), but in a more `human' role, and  other events taking place in the galaxy that lend to the development at  Star Wars as we know it, and how things are shaping up in the future.  (note: look at new weapons, the replacement of the battle droids, other  political references and you'll see what I'm talking about).<br />Finally,  Greg Bear hints at another force outside of the known galaxy.  There is  described a powerful race who uses organic technology and organic ships  that one of the Jedi had taken upon herself to follow.  This is mentioned  in sparse sentences throughout the novel and all clues indicate that this  force will become known as the Yuuzhan Vong that will menace the New  Republic many years after the Empire has fallen.e day will become the  1st Grand Moff from `A New Hope'.

Swedish Chef, Jonas Borssen, has written a fabulous book/cook book on the use of chili's that may put other chili books to shame.<br />Upon opening this colorful book, you will get a  great history lesson that spans the globe on the introduction of Chili's  from their discovery, their inclusion in many cultures, and finally how  they made it to your table.  Very fascinating.  Reads like a National  Geographic article.<br />Also included are very helpful tips on Chili  preparation for the many varying types, their descriptions along with  pictures, heat rating, and what dishes they are best suited for.  Very well  done!<br />The pictures and graphics are very clean and colorful and lend a  lot to this book.  The recipes are plentiful and cover the whole spectrum  of foods and styles.  This is just not a 'southwestern' cookbook.  And for  those who have trouble finding just the right Chili....no fear...the author  includes many address's and phone number's in which to contact specialty  stores.<br />The 'only' drawback, if it can even be considered one, is that  some of the recipes are not for the timid in terms of preparation.  You may  want to be an intermediate level 'chef' to attempt some of these, but there  are many novice level dishes as well.  Looking forward to many of the  glazes, salsas, chutney's, and marinades in this one!	2000-06-09

Events go  way back, many centuries to when the America's were newly discovered and we  are introduced to the 'Dream World of the Spirits' if you will.  At this  point you notice this novel will be a big departure from the previous  installments.  Then throughout the book, the current story is suspended as  the reader is forced to shift gears and read about the Dream World and the  going's on there.<br />Soon after the strange opening, your favorite  characters return only few short weeks where Rio Grande Fall left off.  Sonny, now in a wheel chair takes a very spiritual or supernatural turn of  events that the reader may have trouble adjusting to, as these elements  were not as strong in the first two novels.  At the very least you can see  that Sonny Baca makes a huge spiritual transformation, but this gets way  out there....Sonny and nemesis Raven now do battle on the plane of Dreams.  Sonny now has `the power' (?) to enter dreams at will and how the dreams  play out ends up affecting reality!  When did this detective series become  Science Fiction or a X-Files episode?<br />Also like the previous novels, you  need to have a working Spanish vocabulary, as the author tends to switch  from English mid sentence to Spanish.  You may get the gist of what the  characters are trying to say, but when it is in paragraphs you get  frustrated because you have no idea what is being talked about.<br />The  hokiest part of the novel is this...Sonny has a morning epiphany that in  this day and age you need a computer with access to the Internet to help  catch criminals.  Just so happens (coincidence) that he dials a friend at a  Library who just so happens to have a clich&eacute; latch-key kid expert who hangs  out on the net all day.  So of course when Sonny visits young 'Cyber' (how  original), the computer just so happens have been donated by the same  agency Sonny is investigating (gee...another coincidence).  Even more  eye-brow raising is the fact that  Cyber is also there doing his own  research in the same field that Sonny is seeking information on.  To make  it even worse Sonny gives Cyber some very minimal information and by the  time Sonny gets home from the Library and has a meal Cyber calls and has  like 90% of all the info Sonny needed in like 2 hours!  The author  basically has no idea on how the Internet works, and anyone who does, your  eyes will roll at the absurdity of these events.<br />Finally, nothing is  really new in this novel.  It's Sonny vs. Raven again, thick in metaphors,  a never ending battle that has now spanned three novels.  The climax was a  let down, and there were two events that just miraculously fixed themselves  with nor real or pliable explanation.<br />If you were a fan of the 1st two,  (which I was) you will definitely have to suspend your obvious intuition of  logic and reality to truly enjoy this.o hangs  out on the net all day.

Each character shines in their own way, and you'll see a bit of your  friends and yourself in everyone.<br />The story centers about four 30  something friends in trying to save a fifth friend from his own  destruction, and in doing so discover more about themselves and each other  despite being best friends over all these years.  What makes this novel so  great is the strength of the character's dialogue...I have had these  conversations so many times myself, and had the same introspections that  the main character Ben reflects upon.<br />Mixed in this tale that spans just  a few short weeks is a great sense of humor (much like Nick Hornby's 'High  Fidelity' &amp; 'About A Boy'), all too real emotion and self-worth, quirky  situations, and a non-stop pace.  Every chapter left me begging for more,  and I'd really like to see a sequel.  This is begging to be made into a TV  mini-series or movie.<br />Also, as a person who just turned 30 myself, the  references to everything 80's and late 70's is a fun walk down nostalgia  lane.  There are things discussed within the chapters that brought a smile  to my face as I too remember certain songs, shows, events, etc... that were  part of my childhood and how I reacted to them in my life.<br />In a  nutshell, I think this novel perfectly captures Generation X as we enter  our 30's.  Great job!	2000-05-22
US	52913038	R2SOIIW9EY86GG	0849911796	723070327	The Visitation	Books	3	9	11	N	N	Two novels in one.....	Admittedly, this is the first Frank Peretti novel I have read, after reading many other Christian novels and I have very mixed feelings about giving this a stellar review.<br />The cover is definitely eye catching and  the inside synopsis grabbed my attention.  I had some high expectations for  this book, and it did deliver on most fronts, but let me down in  others.<br />The overall concept of the story was very intriguing and  promising, and the initial chapters really did a fine job on setting the  stage, but 'lo, like many Christian authors, the story tends to become  somewhat 'Christian cliche' for fear that the reader cannot handle secular  material.  In short it is the basic Christian formula: Good guy loses his  way in 'The Word' and falls away temporarily until some more heinous and  evil force moves into town whereas said good guy has a change of heart and  all becomes good once again.  There are some very valuable lessons here  within the pages I think most Christians can identify with, but they border  on the too obvious at times.<br />I think the most distracting part of this  novel for me was it felt as I was reading two novels at once.  The main  character often reflects on his past, and when he does this his past  becomes chapters upon itself.  Though interesting as a back story, and does  fill in some gaps, the author goes too far in depth on events that really  have no relevance to the main story. He speaks endlessy out times of his  life that could have been summed up much more quickly for the reader. About  1/4 to 1/3 of the book is this way and interferes with the fast pace events  that are happening 'present day' in Antioch.<br />In the present day story  there are also events that seem a bit hokey, contrived, etc., and even  after the stories climax, there are some loose ends with characters that  never are tied up.  Ex: Dee Baylor, Kyle, some of the other ministers in  town, Sally, etc. What ever happened to them and their relationships with  God and family?  The epilogue jumps into the future and paints a cheery  ending, but forgets some of the characters we have invested in so much as  the reader.  I personally felt cheated.<br />Is this a good novel?  Yes.  Is  it sound in The Word of Christ?  Yes.  It is very entertaining, and makes  you think about your spirituality with Jesus, and perhaps it was purposely  simple at times to send a clear message to us.  However, the long drags of  the main characters personal history, some unresolved plot lines, and some  highly skeptical behavior of the townsfolk impede this novel to what it  could have been.  These supposed miraculous events of healing and the  Messiah have descended on the small town of Antioch, but we never now why  the false prophet chose Antioch to begin with.  We never learn about the 3  demons that accompany the false messiah.  The rest of the world's news  media seems to ignore what is really happening, though real world news  would bombard this place much more heavily than is portrayed.  It seemed  the rest of the world (in the novel) was a little out of touch to the  return of a 'messiah'.God and family?

I initially bought this as a gift, but ended up keeping it myself.  This is not your typical rock star coffee book with the same rehashed Elvis tidbits regurgitated over and over again.<br />From the very 1st pages you will learn more about Elvis's family that has ever been told.  The records  are more than just accurate, their are TONS of factual pictures and  documents that have been scoured up from all of the Presley family and  elsewhere.  It is outsatnding!  For the devout Elvis fan, I guarantee you  will learn new tidbits, especially his early life in highschool, how many  times they moved, and ALL the odd jobs he had.<br />The day-to-day history is  simple to read, and full of very amazing trivia.  Short enough to keep you  interested, yet very detailed.  The only con I have with this book is that  it lists many of his early booking dates, with no more than the location  and those get a bit tedious after a while.<br />The pictures throughout the  book are amazing.  Never have I seen a collection of Elvis pictures, and  I'm sure many of them have never been in print before.  The occasional full  page 'splash' pictures capture The King in all his splendor from different  periods of his life, whereas this book can almost be considered an  art/photography book. (I really liked his judo poses throughout the years  in his different costumes backstage-amusing)<br />In addition to the life of  Elvis, we see the corresponding day by day accounts of Col. Tom Parker,  Priscilla, Vernon, Gladys, and tons of other characters that somehow would  come to touch Elvis's life.  Truly a treasure, you will not be disapointed  with this book at this price!  Now I gotta buy another one as the first  gift I intended it to be.	2000-05-09
US	52913038	R1783F7TAEVN24	0688172849	159252919	Test Pattern: A Novel	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Rod Serling meets Beaver Cleaver	They say a good book jacket catches the eye, even if the story doesn't.  Well, I say because of the very unique cover they suckered me into picking this up, and boy am I glad I did.  The novel that lies within this cover is  not your typical Americana novel, but a highly charged realistic and fun  look into teh typical family of the 50's.  Then throw in the Twilight  Zone.<br />It is really interesting how the author tackles this tale.  First  off, all we know is that it takes place in the 50's with a simple cast of  characters who delude themselves in believing that life portrayed on  television is real and utopian.  They all long to be like Ozzie &amp;  Harriet or the Nelson's, and quite simply their strive for this perfection  only causes more problems in any nuclear family.<br />Second, and refreshing,  is that the chapters alternate (but overlap) between the perspectives of  Cassie, age 11, and her star struck mother, Lorena.  We see the motivation  of Lorena's antics in one chapeter, then Cassie's take on the same event in  the next.  The chapters are relatively short, which makes this for easy  reading and captures your attention much more readily.<br />Third, without  giving the 'magic' of the book away, Cassie has the ability to see snipets  of the future through their new television.  It's amusing to read an eleven  year old girls takes on events that we think are the norm today, but  totally outlandish back in the 50's, and God forbid she try to explain it  to adults back then.  They think she's a loon!  But we know  otherwise.<br />Highly recommend this, and look forward to future titles from  this author.	2000-04-11

Michael Stackpole is a great sci fi writer.  'I, Jedi' was great, and this novel solidifies him as a boneafide Star Wars novelist.  His descriptions of landscapes, alien worlds and technology vividly paint pictures within  your head without going overboard like other authors.<br />What makes  Onslaught a unique book is: 1) This book begins a story arc that seems to  fit in between Vector Prime's overall story arc.  Though it can be read  alone, probably best if you read Vector Prime first to understand some  events.  2) It is hard to describe, but this is a great novel with no real  plot resolution or end.  This novel seems to almost to be a prelude to an  actual novel not yet out--meaning that there are numerous events taking  shape all across the Star Wars universe, almost shot like small vignettes,  and only towrds the physical end of the novel do things start shaping up  getting ready for hopefully the next one.  3) The Vong (enemies) here have  no central characters unlike the one's in Vector Prime.  They are treated  as this overall imposing threat and we learn more about them through their  actions and culture, but no one Vong character is present....until the  Epilouge.  4) Some of your main SW chracters you have learned to love  aren't here or play very MINOR roles....Han is only around very briefly in  the beginning, Lando has a 'few' moments, there really is no 3PO, Ackbar,  Mothma, Antilles, etc.<br />5) &lt;I seperated this for a reason&gt; Another  character dies.  This lends some believability to this New Jedi Order of  novels.  The characters we love, aren't invincible anymore, and neither are  their friends.  A great plus!<br />6) Most importantly, I beelive this novel  truly does usher us into the next generation of Star Wars.  We see some  returning Jedi from other novels playing a more prominent role, you see  less of the standard characters, we are seeing new enemies with little of  the Imperial Remenant.  However, this is the deciding novel where the Solo  children are finally given their own identities.  We were always treated to  Jacen and Jaina as twins and whenever they were written about it was  typical twin stuff.  Anakin Solo was just the cute little kid who was  strong in the force.  But here is where Stackpole shines....We now see the  individual strengths, fears, and dreams of these children.  Jacen is very  insightful questioning his own role as a Jedi, Anakin full of Pride (never  wants to let Luke or Mara down), Jaina full of adventure (the next Rouge).  It just gets better and better.<br />I think one of the best scenes for me  was when Jacen and Anakin were side by side, new Jedi's in trade, taking on  the Vong.  It was a real page turner and I felt as if I was there with  them, adrenaline pumping.  When a writer can do that, it's a good novel!re the Solo  children are finally given their own identities.

The titlecan be no clearer: The Greatest Generation.  Yes, there are the stories of the men who fought in WWII, but what of the women back home, the wives, the children, the neighbors, the relatives.<br />This is a great book in understanding the moral up-bringing and pride and sense of responsibility that was prominent back in the 40's and 50's but has seemed to disapear with the current generation.  Our generation will be remembered as the one who blamed everybody but themselves for personal problems and making frivoulos lawsuits.<br />These were people who came out of a depression just to go into a war, and for those that came back, to turn there lives around. Not just for themselves, but for their families, and for ours today. They didin't know the word defeat, and made sure there families were a priority (can we say that about ourselves today?)<br />This book took people from all walks of life and painted a very realistic picture of what patriotic pride is all about.  They weren't seeking glory or money, but had a deeper meaning of fullfilling a wanting in their hearts to help their fellow American.<br />Some of the individual account can be a bit tedious at times, but there are many other stories of what true hero's are/were and that doesn't mean you had to be holding a rifle.  There were plety of unsung hero's back here at home.<br />With myself just turning 30, I am convinced that those Americans (of all backgrounds) of the 40's and 50's truly were the Greatest Generation. They were the generation that ensured we would have our own generation.	2000-03-20

In this novel, we see the return of all our favorite Excalibur characters and plot lines that had been started early in the series.<br />Again, I commend  Peter David for writing a fascinating Star Trek novel, this time packed  with science, action, humor, and above all more character development.  The  science aspect was ingenious, something that you can only expect in the  Trek universe.<br />We learn much more about the inner-workings of Calhoun,  Selar, McHenry, Kalinda, Xyon, and especially Si-Cwan.  Si-Cwan is written  expertly and many of his internal/emotional dealings are very common for us  'humans'.  There is also the constant fun-barbing between Si-Cwan and  Kebron a futuristic odd-couple.<br />There were a few surprises (don't wanna  give 'em away).....always fun.  And the cliffhanger demands the new novel  arrive shortly.  Overall, this installment was much more fast paced than  the last, and the result was a 'fun' Trek novel.	2000-02-07

There is also wonderful  chracter development, an introduction to a few new characters (handled  expertly), and some reminders of a few past characters.  This book did have  a plot and made a great journey towards its end.<br />And as always the humor  between Si Cwan and Kebron is always fun, as is the new wit of chracter  'Xyon'.<br />The bad: Well, if you're looking for all your dangling plot lines  from the previous 6 books, they aren't addressed here.  This book really  centers on two chracters who aren't in the previous 6, or even in Star  Fleet.  If you want to see Capt. Calhoun, the Excalibur and her crew,  you're not gonna find it here.<br />Also, though there was some action spots,  for those that are used to that big climatic Starfleet or ship face off  with blasters firing away, this book is a bit shy on that typ eof  action.<br />However this is an excellent read that reminds me more or less of  those individual 'filler' episodes you see once in a while....a refreshing  change, but still longing for the whole crew.	2000-01-27

A quick overview of this guide is no more than the original manual and a manual for Corkscrew Follies (which is not really included when you  purchase the expansion) with some added fluff.<br />For those that are  looking for statistics, there are not many in this book.<br />The pictures are  a bit hard to see in some cases as they appear small and in  grey-scale.<br />However, there are *some* re-deeming qualities.  There are  actually a few good hints on queue lines, where to place entreances/exits,  where to place shope and how to price items.  There are some good building  hints on underground rides and tunneling, but there are just as many  common-sense things as well that you don't need any manual to figure  out.<br />However, like its name sake should indicate, there really isn't too  much on actual roller coaster building.<br />Lastly the Scenario Listing  does give some hints on how to complete certain scenarios, but they are  very vague, to the point its not that helpful.	2000-01-24

I was actually in Cortez and missed the events that transpired by about 1/2 hour.<br />Mr. Hillerman's book is a seperate story in  itself refrencing the '98 manhunt and events, but enter Jim Chee and Lt.  (now civilian) Leaphorn.  The book opened fast and set up events that would  eventually lead to the climax, but I must say I was a bit disapointed with  the quick resolution.<br />What make Hillerman's novels strong are the  intricate chracter developments that carry over from novel to novel.  You  just can't get enough of Leaphorn's thinking outside conventional lines and  Chee's attitude.  What was missing from this novel was more of the Native  American mythology/folklore that Hillerman is usually known for.  Though  not needed in this novel, it is generally a pleasure to read and learn  about Native American spirituality and customs.<br />The only frustrating  aspect of this book is the overly drawn out love lives of our two main  characters.  With each novel, there never seems to be any progression over  Leaphorn's deceased wife, or Chee's ability to really go after what he  secretly wants (Officer Bernie).  There is some hinting in this book, but  I'd like to see Mr. Hillerman tie up one of these lingering plotlines in  his next book.<br />Otherwise, the book will keep you guessing and it is a  real fun read.	2000-01-20

Here comes a new enemy, unlike any ever seen  in the known SW universe.  The author's description of this new force is  both artistic and deep, yet as the story unfolds we are still looking for  answers.  Perhaps in a follow up book?<br />Second the character development  is astonishing.  Many of the characters have grown older, more mature, more  mortal and their perpectives reflect that.  There is also a passing of the  torch if you will for the next generation of Jedi.  Anakin, Jacen, and  Jaina Solo are teens now, Luke is married to Mara Jade and contemplates  having his own children.  There are many emotional moments between Han Solo  and his children, and more of an insight to his character than has ever  been written about.  Chapter three really stuck out for me as the defining  chapter of character development for new inductees in the SW  universe.<br />For those that don't read the Dark Horse Comics or other  novels, you may not recognize some people or refrences, but they are not  needed to move this story along.  This novel is a very well put together,  self-contained story.  You will appreciate it more if you know the history  of Mara's wedding, Lando's dealings, and some of the New Republics council,  but again....not needed for the plot at hand.<br />The book moves along at a  decent pace, and we learn that our invincible characters, are no longer  invincible.  Finally, the last climax of the book makes for great  swashbuckling action, just like the Battle of Yavin as seen in Star  Wars.<br />With this novel, there is a re-birth, or better yet an infusion of  what I feel has been a long overdue house of ideas and concepts to explore.  There are many more stories that can get a jump start right here, and  breathe the magic back into Star Wars.<br />Very well done.ore.

I would consider myself a smart wrestling 'mark' as the jargon goes and view wrestling as a pure form of entertainment.  Now when I first heard that Mick Foley was coming out with a book, I though 'neat' in passing.  What impressed me more was that he wrote it himself, long-hand, while on  tour and turned it in to be typed.  But let's be real, how many people 1st  thought a wrestler's book may be good?  Or entertaining?  Or  logical?<br />Well this book is all of that and more!  Mick Foley recounts his  entire wrestling career from his first exposure to wrestling as a kid  watching it on T.V. to finally winning the coveted WWF World Champion belt  some 15+ years later.<br />His story is laced with amazing stories, great  humor (he has a wonderful sense of wit), an inside perspective on the  'sport', and both little known and well known facts of the wrestling  industry.  He portrays himself not as an egotistical muscle head who has an  action figure, but constantly proclaims he is baffled by his success.  He  will be the first one to state that he bombed some nights, that he was out  of shape, and many things and decisions went wrong.<br />Then he re-counts  some of his greatest matches (and not so great) in detail.  What is amazing  is his dedication to his fans and to the sport he really loves, and how  much his body has been in jeapordy over the years.  To all those that  believe wrestling is not a sport and is scripted, they fail to take into  account that this man has had hundreds of stiches, a broken nose, a missing  ear, knocked out teeth, concusions, numerous dislocations, MRI's, X-rays,  etc.  Other traditional sports atheletes would have buckled much earlier  and made much more money than Mick.  He did this all for our  entertainment!<br />Mick Foley is also a family man.  Like the late Owen  Hart, you can see that Mick Foley puts his role as a father and husband at  the top of his priorities.  Constantly speaking of his lovely wife and his  children.<br />Lastly, with his humor and accolades to other wrestlers aside,  he has one of the best closing lines in any autobiography./>Lastly, with his humor and accolades to other wrestlers aside,  he has one of the best closing lines in any autobiography.	2000-01-05

I have read all of his books, and I can say like 'Where Serpents Lie', The Blue Hour is a real page turner....So much so, that I finished the book in about 2 days.<br />What is so amazing about his novels is his character  development.  His characters are not cookie-cutter super detectives, but  real people with real problems, sometimes even tragic problems.  This lends  a lot more to a stories credability.  In addition, being a resident of  Southern California, I know many of the places he writes about, and he  nails them to a 'Tee'.<br />I have noticed that Mr. Parkers novels as of late  have taken a darker tone to them.  The more horrific side of homicide,  almost tickled the musings of Rod Serling.  No, this is not fantasy like  the Twighlight Zone, but the crimes are bizarre and so real...<br />The Blue  Hour had many plot twists near the end and reached a climatic stage that  really made you want to read faster and placed you right in the middle of  things.  The nice (or not so nice thing) is that Mr. Parkers novel's always  have an unexpected ending, and they are not always happy endings!<br />Why  this didn't rate 5 stars in my eyes is that there were two incidents in the  book I had a hard time getting over: 1) The very end &lt;didn't quite  understand the relevance&gt;, and a brief interlude about 2/3rds of the way  through that sets up the very end.  I think it was somewhat unlikely,  though possible.<br />Also, anyone out there that knows how I can get in touch  with Hyperion Books for fan mail to Mr. Parker, please let me know.  Looking forward to his next novel 'The Red Light'	1999-12-29

The varying landscapes of this  novel are a joy to read.<br />The characters, for the most part, are  interesting, and you soon take on a few favorites.  However, some (not all)  are very cliche, the same type you see over and over again in these types  of novels.  And a few of the names are hard to pronounce (because of thier  heritage).  Lastly there are soooo many characters to keep track of, it may  get confusing at times who is on who's side, and who is related or  connected to someone else.<br />The novel itself is good, but what makes this  very interesting is that there are multiple stories going on concurrently,  and one overall 'big picture'.  I found that the introduction of the book  was fun and showed a lot of promise, but soon the story takes on a more  lethargic tone, and it seems to take forever.  Only until the last 100  pages, where once again the book picks up in action and resolves some plot  lines.  This is where the book is made, and now I MUST buy the second to  see how things pan out.<br />I personally would have liked to see much more  involvement of the Egyptians, both in characters and in landscape.  Though  this is a book about the Roman Empire, a large portion of the book does not  take place anywhere near Rome or Egypt, but Persia.<br />Overall this 510 page  book, probably could have been just as good, or better, by cutting out some  non-essential occurences (maybe they were meant to flesh out chracters) and  bringing it down to 350-375 pages.	1999-12-06

There are a few  instances of real page turners where you the author shocks you and your jaw  drops.<br />What stops this from 5 stars is a slightly 'hokey' climax, and a  very quick resloution to one of the sub-plots, but on the whole a very  eerie, bordering on supernatural thriller.	1999-11-10

Gas Station, a story that could probably take place in anyrural town, is a true slice of the typical average American dream.

Your first beer, your first cigarette, how you view yoru parents and the immediate world that surrounds you.<br />However, the book lacks plot.  There is no climax, no intricate story, just a time slice of a young man's life.<br />The difficulty in this book is its rhythm.  I found myself re-reading sections of the book because of the lack of where a sentance starts and where it ends.  Without punctuation, you find many thoughts becomming a blur and it takes time to sort them all out into cohesive thoughts to digest.<br />The myriad of characters had much promise, and I would have liked to see many of their motivations, but they were discussed.

It probably deserves 4 stars, however I am still having trouble with some of  the campy dialouge.  Being a Christian myself, I am totally aware of the  'Christian' way of writing books without using secular or graphic dialouge,  however, to make the characters more believable, they must drop the  &quot;Gee Whiz&quot; &amp; &quot;Golly&quot; type statements.  The worst  abuser is Chloe (though 22), she talks like Robin from the 60's Batman  series. Even the best Christians I know still talk somewhat like it is  1999.<br />As far as the story goes, we finally see more action when it comes  to Buck, and the introduction of many new characters to help flesh out this  novel universe.  The additions of Mac and Ritz, and Dr. Charles are  welcome.<br />Some astounding developments happen with Nicolae's 1st hand man,  and it is somewhat comic the interaction between him and the Pontifex  Maximus Peter Mathews.  The world is only big enough for one of thier  ego's.<br />It seems that by the 5th installment, we will finally see some  more fast paced action that takes this religious novel to the standards of  a good spy story.	1999-09-13

It is a great origin story on how Spock was first introduced to Starfleet as a boy and an excellent story on the dealings of his emotions looking for  approval from his father Sarek.  A great in depth on charcater development  on the warring emotional half human side of Spock and his logical side as  well.<br />It was nice to see Uhura shine and there are always the quick quips  of Dr. McCoy to laugh over.<br />The overall story was a little weak and very  predictable.  The story is set up in a way where there are no major  suprises.  I think this book was more of a fill-in book on the some of the  missing years between the disaperance of Kirk and when Spock becomes an  Ambassador.	1999-09-02

After two previous lack-luster lead-ins, Hard Merchandise finally delivers the goods.<br />I seemed to muddle through the very drawn out prequels to this trilogy often wondering where sub plots were going.  Though there were some  good moments in those books, all the action, drama, and resolution happens  here.<br />In this last installment we see Fett as his best, and even at his  best, he gets blackmailed and taken advantage of.  Not easy to do to Fett,  but whence he figures this out, there is hell to pay for all those  involved.<br />Great revelations abound at the end, finally revealing all  the mysteries that plagued the reader during the first two.  Not only was  the story better, but Keter himself became a better Star Wars writer with  this novel.  He has redeemed himself in my eyes and made Fett the most  notorious Bounty Hunter in the galaxy.	1999-08-13
US	52913038	RAPYKWWWJG4M0	1573227331	602052020	About a Boy	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Almost 5 stars	This being the second novel of Mr. Hornby's I read (High Fidelity being the first), I will definetly be reading any future novels by this author.  Why?  It is hilarious and real!<br />Many of the conversations that take  place between the charatcers are funny and ridiculous, but while reading  them you can't help but think that you yourself had these same conversation  with yourfriends and family they were just as quirky and odd in retrospect.  That is the strength of Mr. Hornby's novels- the insight in our  behaviors.<br />Some of the scenarios were slightly predictable, but that  isn't all that bad, because you find youself turning the pages anyway to  see the spin on them.<br />The book wrapped up a bit too quickly for me and  there were one or two questions I would have likes addressed, but they are  not critical in enjoying thsi novel.<br />Looking forward to the next one.	1999-08-02

I, Jedi is probably one of the best novels to carry the Star Wars moniker that I have read in ages.<br />Michael Stackpole has a unique way of writing this book that I don't think has been done with any other SW novel.  The  character, a lesser character who never appears in the movies but makes his  marks as part of the infamous Rogue Squadron is elevated to main character  status in this novel.  What is even more unique is that the novel is  written in 1st person, seeing events unfold throughout the galaxy with his  eyes.  His take on the force and that of Luke Skywalker.<br />An added bonus  is that this book parallels the events of Kevin J. Anderson's Jedi Academy  Trilogy.  It was truly neet to read another perspective of events that  transpired in the aforementioned triolgy.  It fills in many blanks from  that series.<br />However, I, Jedi felt like two novels really.  There is an  overall plot, but our character spends the 1st third of the book in almost  a seperate storyline, and then Mr. Stackpole switches gears to continue  with the original story.  It ends up working out nicely in the ned, but  while your reading it, you wonder where things are going.<br />I hope there is  a follow up novel with Jedi Horn.	1999-07-26

And dump your fiance while you're at  it.<br />Steven Roberts did just this.  Sold the house, cars, quit his job to  begin his long (and true) trek across the United States.  Armed with a CB,  a sattelite uplink, a laptop computer, and other high tech gadgets (circa  late 1980's) he writes about his journeys in a fascinating manner.  This is  what MTV's Road Rules is....for adults.  What is amazing is the people he  meets along the way, the sites he sees, the trials and tribulation of  finding water and getting a flat tire.  I can't give enough praise for this  book, and would love to read anotehr one if he has one.	1999-07-08

Why?:  Read on.....<br />1st, Yes, some  sequences were changed.  Anybody who saw the movie and studied it will see  that there are, though few, slight changes in what actually happens.  But  this isn't all bad, if you can muddle through one or two minor  inconsistencies, you will really appreciate the 'extra' sequences that did  not take place in the movie.  Yes, there is more with Anakin (a great  insight to his character), more dialouge with all the main characters, even  C-3PO and Maul!<br />However there were a few drawbacks for me that warranted  this 3 stars:  1) Some scenes/events were cut short, glossed over, or never  referenced (Jar Jar tank sequnce differed, Anakin Naboo starfighter pilot  scene differed, Sidious/Rune dialouge differed, etc....), 2) Many of the  battles seemed rushed to me.  I never felt I was in the battle myself, i.e.  there was no sense of grandeur to key turning points, 3) finally, Terry  Brooks may be a decent author in his own right, but this novel lacked the  pure description of locals, objects, characters that make the SW universe  so outstanding.  Writers like Stackpole, Anderson, even Zahn have a better  flair for describing a setting, painting a picture in your head than Brooks  does.  Frankly, his descriptions bored me.  I often thought he should have  made more mention of this or that, aptly placing the reader right there in  the scene, but it never really happened.	1999-06-28
US	52913038	R390RPQEHG1QYA	067100882X	836520037	Star Trek: Dark Victory	Books	4	12	13	N	Y	More in depth character development, promises a big climax	This being the second novel in what I'm guessing is a trilogy started off with a bang.  I think that the climax/cliff hanger for the 1st in this series had everyone chomping to get to their hands on this one.<br />The  action picks up right where the other left off, but after chapter 2 things  slow down.  There is some action, not a lot, but that's not what this story  is about.  This whole book is about character (especially and obviously  Kirk's) motivation and how much of a mirror he is of the Tiberius (his  counterpart in the mirror universe).<br />There is some old fashion detective  work that makes this novel more like a mystery at times.  Guessing on who  is manipulating who, how things are done, a shadow Starfleet organization  and what its purpose is, plus a few surprises kept my interest.<br />What is  missing from this book is much about the Next Generation cast.  They are  here, but the primary role revolves around Kirk, then Spock (or Spock's)  and the shadow Starfleet organization.<br />What was a nice surprise is to see  that Garak (DS9) plays a role in the book, as does a few other mentionables  from the various TV series and movies.<br />Nearing the end of the book the  action picks up again, but ends not so much with an outstanding  cliffhanger, but yet another plotline which promises to answer some big  overall questions on the history of both universes from the beginning.<br />It also looks as if the next book will include much more Next Generation  involvement.  Looking forward to it!	1999-06-10
US	52913038	R3OF2BDPX3P3BU	0842329145	940457812	Nicolae: The Rise of Antichrist (Left Behind, Book 3)	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Slowest of the first three	Though the story (I guess I should say prophecy yet to be fullfilled) brings the reader deeper into the mire of earthly doom, Nicolae (book 3 of 7) is the slowest so far.<br />For a novel that is 415 pages long, I felt it  could have moved at a much faster pace.  Don't get me wrong, there are at  least 2 exciting moments in the book that were real page turners, but the  other 350 pages dragged on.  It does help further along some character  development and their are a few interesting sub plots, but I look forward  to the 4th, for it appears now things are about to pick up for the  Tribulation Force and the forces of good and evil.<br />My only real complaint  is some of the hokey dialouge.  I consider myself christian, and yet I  don't hear people talk like the characters do in real lide.  The dialouge  is at times, campy, like June and Ward Cleaver.  If the end times are upon  us, reality would be much harsher than portrayed here.<br />I give this book 2  1/2 stars.	1999-05-27

Leaphorn and have not come across a bad book yet.<br />I think perhaps my problem here is that was an older novel and I have read many of the newer  ones first, so it's like going back in time to view the characters at an  earlier date.<br />With this in mind, I think that Tony Hillerman has  definently improved over the course of his novels as Coyote Waits, though a  good read, is not as evidently mature as his later titles.<br />A few sub  plots could have been a bit stronger, but the overall story was  entertaining.  Read this one in chronological order to the others and you  won't be disapointed.	1999-05-20

I've read most of the Joe Leaphorn/Jim Chee novels and have liked them all bar none.  The First Eagle is anotehr good read and probably deserves a higher rating, if not lacking a few minor but important attributes which  usually makes this series so good.<br />1st- Though the story had me guessing  the whole time (it truly was a mystery up to the end), I was let down by  how anti-climatic it was.  Everything is literally wrapped up in just a few  pages, a big let down for me after guessing the whole way through.<br />2nd-  Though there is still the blend of Native American folklore and religion,  it is very toned down in this book.  I liked this series for the sheer fact  that Tony Hillerman mixed in a lot of Native American customs and culture  in his past books, but it was not as apparent here.<br />The book was still a  great read, and actually begs for a follow up as we see further character  development and new situations arising.  Hope there is another.  With this  in mind, I probably should have given it 4 stars.	1999-05-11

An actor from a defunct campy sci-fi show I loved as a child attempting to continue the voyages of the Galactica.<br />I bought it anyway for nostalgia's sake, and I was very  pleasantly surprised.  All you favorites are there, plus an introduction to  a few new characters.<br />It was very interesting to see what has happened  after all these years to the fleet, the characters, their children, Baltar,  the Cylons and more.  The book does a great job in bringing you up to  speed, and filling in many blanks they plagued T.V. viewers so many years  ago.  I liked the origin explanation of the Cylons.<br />Also, you can see  where many themes of the old testament are relevant here as they are also  mixed in with Greek mythos.  Those that are familar with the bible will  appreciate many of the parallel's drwan here in the book.<br />Decent plot,  begs for a sequel.  The only reason this did not rate 5 stars was the lack  of action in space battles.  Though the battles were there, I felt as if I  were missing the feel of sitting in a Viper and blasting Cylons.<br />Kudos to  Richard Hatch and Christopher Golden.	1999-05-04
US	52913038	R2ZQPET6I6H6PD	1573225517	138260184	High Fidelity	Books	5	9	10	N	N	So true to life its scary	Not only was the book and some its characters straight from a BBC sitcom with their dry humor, but their outlooks on life and what is important to them is refreshing in a novel form.  So many times we read book where every  character (even supporting ones) have an overall agenda and strive for a  higher goal by the finale of a book.  Not here, that is why it is so real.  How many friends and loved ones do you know that still muddle through life  after all these years?  Well, they are all represeneted in this book.<br />As  far as the main character Rob, though we may not have the same job, and he  is fictional, his thoughts I am sure have crossed those of many men over  the years.  That's why it was so scary to me.  I saw parts of my life, my  justifications, my actions resonating here between pages.  There were times  I laughed out loud (okay numerous times), but also took moments to reflect  that I had done and am doing the same things Rob is doing.  And I'm sure my  friends could say the same things about themselves.<br />Even if you are not a  british rock fan (I'm not), hopefully you'll enjoy this book as much as I  did.	1999-04-26

The action only seems to pick up in the last thrid of the book, and I found it to be a real page turner at that point.<br />The first  2/3rd's of the book has some heavy character development, which is good to  a point, but seems a bit drawn out at times.<br />There is a great moving and  riveting chapter (Around Chap. 16-17), where a very respected Rabbi  confronts the two witnesses at the Wailing Wall.  I found this very  emotional and very powerful turning point in the book.  I ended up reading  it more than once because the affect was stunning!	1999-03-25

One would think by the title alone, we may delve back into the origin of Boba Fett.  But that's not the case here.<br />The story  seems intriguing, and has a fresh concept for the Star Wars universe:  basically a story NOT revolving around Luke, Leia, Han and Vader.<br />To me  the story was a bit long winded at times.  Certain events just seemed to  drag on with no clear ending in sight.  I thought a few of the stars were  out of character as well, including Fett.  Fett has always been a man a few  words, but there are a few times he seems just as verbose as C-3PO would  be.  Zuckess seemed out of character from the one portrayed in 'Tales of  the Bounty Hunters'.<br />There was also a lot of scheming. Though plausible  knowing these characters, for the new reader one can get lost in all the  double, and triple crossing.  Keeping note of whose loyalty belonged to  whom became difficult at times.<br />The last thing I had a problem with was  the time frame constantly shifted from chapter headers &quot;NOW&quot; and  &quot;THEN&quot;.  Very tiresome too switch your mindset between events  that happened years ago to the present then back again.<br />I do plan on  reading the next two installments, because the story did hook me, but I  believe the same 387 page story could have been told well in under 300.	1999-03-18

Never before have I read a fictional book based upon what most true Christians believe is propechy of things to come in the end times.<br />As a Christian, who unfortunately forgets his role sometimes, I was very moved  at times through the book.  I caught myself crying at times, and  spiritually affected on knowing what I truly believe what is coming.  Am I  worthy of God's plans?  I pray that I am, because the all too real  depictions of events to come is something I wouldn't wish on any human.  This book only wants me to share Christ with others close to me and anyone  who asks.<br />This is not a book to put people down or to scare people into  religion.  I think the authors did a fine job of showing God's love and  plan for us here on earth as shown by the main characters.  These are  conversations/questions that every person has at times through their life  about spirtual matters.<br />I eagerly await sitting down and reading the next  ones.<br />The only reason it did not earn 5 stars in my mind, is that after  the Rapture, I can only imagine the earth's populace in much more despair  and panic.  Though the authors elude to tough times, its seems many people  go about their day to day activities without really harboring on the fact  that many of their loved ones and all the children of the world have  dissapeared.	1999-03-03

I bought this book as more of a fill in the gaps type of curiosity I had after watching HBO's &quot;The Rat Pack&quot; (see it if you can).  After watching the two hour movie, I was intrigued about how the Rat Pack was  formed, how it lived, how it disbanded and all the great stories that went  with it...<br />This book delivers all that and much more.<br />It is a  friendly read, neither critical or praising; straight down the line as  accurate and level headed as can be.<br />What I really enjoyed was the  origins of each of the members.  Then there was the mafia and multiple  dames tie-ins.  The Kennedy's are portrayed in this book and it lends to a  great history lesson in back door politics.<br />Then the book closes with the  eventual downfall of their swinging empire.  What exactly happened to each  cast member and the people that surrounded them.  Its all answered.<br />This  book gives great insight to each of the players.  By the end of each  chapter I was sure whether I loved them, or hated them.<br />A definite must  read!!!	1999-02-12

After a decent opener, a flat sequel, this third installment is the best of the bunch.<br />Though it is much more action packed than the last, and the main characters are all reunited once again to fend off a common threat, it  somewhat lacks the humor (from Q's dialouge) of the 1st book.<br />What I  really enjoyed was more of the background of the main villian/s and their  lore in past Star Trek moments.  It is really neat to see how tightly  alligned some of these books in comparison to the Star Trek Universe can  be.<br />I was expecting a bit more of the Continuum to rear their heads as  the trilogy implies, but not really.  Also, after done with all three, I'm  not sure I learned anything spectacular about the Continuum and thier  origins.<br />All in all, Mr. Cox I believe redeemed himself with this book as  number 2 was a let down.<br />Enjoy, and I look forward to more Q antics.	1999-02-05

The first book was good and had much more action and humor than this second installment did.  Here the story, while still partly in the present, actually takes us to the past to an event that changes Q's life forever.  Though the premis is good, it is drawn out ever so long, and I found myself  wanting to skip ahead to where the action is.<br />There are a few interesting  events, but Q is not as well written as he was in the last book.<br />Other  major characters take a back seat to the overall plot in this  chapter.<br />The one thing that really bothered me is that Jean Luc, for  reasons unkown, cannot figure out why Q is allowing him to witness events  in the past.  It is sooooo obvious to the reader, but Jean Luc only figures  it out on the last page.<br />I honestly think the author could have condensed  book two into books 1 and 3 respectfully.  Make each one of the slightly  longer and cut out some of the inaction and drawn out sequences.	1999-01-22

But did it hook me because of the  mystery of UFO's or because some of the explanations about UFO's and their  relationship with humans, the earth, our world governments, conspiracies,  religion are so wacky it was enticing to read what the author would say  next.<br />It did present one or two theories that I did find very interesting  and even plausible, and it did lend much more mystery to the Men In Black.  Just who are these dark dressed men who answer nothing and interogate the  victims of UFO incidents,then scaring them half to death.<br />This book is  classic for the pulp science fiction readers of the late 40's and early  50's where science was mysterious to the common man.  But now in 1999 it is  really hard to believe (and embarrassing to know) that we as a society  actually thought this way.	1999-01-05
US	52913038	RZGLG9EA748XF	0553100351	754763007	Star Wars: Vision of the Future	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Slightly long and drawn out.	First, I admit, I am a huge SW fan.  I have read about 85% of all the hardback novels and most of the softbacks as well.  But why 3 stars when everyone else is giving 5?<br />The story was 'good' and their were a few surprises along the way, especially a huge development for Luke Skywalker  that fans may be excited about.  However, some of the characters we like,  took a second seat to the story or didn't show up at all.  Chewie was not  even present in this book, as were any of the Solo children.  C-3PO had a  minor role, Lobot hardly did a thing, and the potential of Rouge Squadron  was very anti-climatic.<br />Well, actually, in my opinion the whole book was  anti-climatic.  At close to 500 pages, I will admit the last 60-70 pages  started to get tense, and it was a page turner, but the ending wrapped up  so fast!  And it seemed to take forever to get to the last 70 pages.<br />If  you like political intrigue, and multiple story threads, this book is  pretty good.  It was interesting to see how the Imperials were vying for  power, and still cheating each other.  Hats off to one Admiral Palleon (2nd  man to Thrawn) and his resolution to stick things out.<br />There was a lot of  emphasis on Luke and Mara, a whole story in itself that seemed to be 1/2  the novel anyway.<br />Interesting concept, but missed a bit more of the  traditional SW drama, villiany, and epic battles.	1998-12-28

The story so far deserves only three stars at best, but Greg Cox does an excellent job in writing the dialouge  of Q and the introduction of yet another Q and q.  Therefor, I gave it 4  stars, earning a star for its humor, just in itself!<br />The most  entertaining part of this novel is the continous antics of the Q we know  and love, but some of the supporting characters are a bit dull and  aggravating at times.  I'm sure they will play a bigger part in the future  installments.<br />We see a very brief intoduction into Q's origin, and I'm  sure this will be explored in the following books as well.	1998-12-10
US	52913038	R9FKFR33MKX08	0553578766	667763921	Tales from the Empire: Star Wars Legends	Books	1	8	10	N	Y	A disapointing collection for the Empire	What the title and the cover seem to promise is far from the actual  content.  Sure the stories are set in the Star Wars universe, but unlike  the other collections (Tales of the Bounty Hunters, Tales of the Mos Eisely  Cantina, Tales from Jabba the Hutt) these stories are very bland, and  uninteresting at times.<br />Sure, some of the stories and characters were  noteworthy, but a large disapointment to fans of Boba Fett, Grand Admiral  Thrawn, other main characters and the ideology and structure of the Empire  itself.  Actually, a few stories had nothing to do with the Empire at all  it seemed, maybe just a footnote, but nothing that compares to the grandeur  of the Empire as depicted in the movies and some of the other recent  novels.<br />I am a huge SW fan, and have read about 80% of 'all' novels set  within the universe, and this by far is one I want to forget about.	1998-10-12

Just when you thought Clancy has, and others in the Techno-War genre,  written every conceivable plot post WWII, a new interesting scenario pops  up.<br />Here you have an innocent bio-firm that has infiltrated all levels of  the American system, only to deceive us with a sinister plot to change the  face of the planet-- literally.<br />Its up to Rainbow, a covert  multi-national anti-terrorist team to unravel the many far-fetched but  related clues to stop this atrocity.  Led by the secretive John Clark,  Rainbow scours the political scene, sending his troops to disolve these  threats as they happen, before any more innocents get caught in the  crossfire.<br />Like all of Clany's works, the situations are highly detailed  and descriptive.  Many technological wonders are used, as well as luck and  detective work on a global scale.<br />The only thing missing from this book  was Jack Ryan, and I thought the conclusion was a slightly anti-climatic.	1998-10-02
US	52913038	R2TA9SYC3CBDJC	0671008781	79173723	Star Trek: Spectre	Books	5	0	0	N	Y	Only half the story......	I have read all the recent Shatner novels and by far this is the best.  Maybe because I'm intrigued by the Mirror Universe (okay, I actually bought the original episode 'Mirror, Mirror'.<br />This novel fillin some of the blanks that were left over from the original series, TNG, and DS9.  I also really liked the idea of incorporating aspects of Voyager.  Shatner is really a stickler for continuaity issues.<br />The only real problem I had was what I thought was the mis-characterization of some of the main characters themselves like Spock and even Kirk (though he wrote it!).  There were just some situations where I couldn't see Spock react the way he did.<br />The novel ended with a great cliffhanger, desperatly awaiting the next one.  Again, the best Shatner-Trek novel to date.	1998-08-04
US	52913038	R3SFUJQW9YY3DV	0446603856	632642370	The Enemy Within	Books	4	2	3	N	N	In the vain of Tom Clancy- Almost 5 stars	I truly enjoyed 'The Enemy Within'.  I am always intrigued on the idea of sleeping countries one day waking up to wreak havoc onto the world, where the U.S. generally comes in to save the day.  Like Clancy, this book offers multiple story threads and characters all doing their own thing, at the same time, all over the world, until the strings get pulled tighter and tighter to a crescendo.  Also mix in CIA and FBI technology and read how the pro's may actually uncover the truth.<br />The only reason I did not give this 5 stars was the very ending.  After the building climax takes place, the book almost literally ends.  I felt cheated with a few of the main characters.  It seemed it just stopped and I asked myself &quot;That's it?&quot;.  Bummed.<br />I read some of his others, Vortex, and Red Phoenix and liked those just as well.	1998-07-22

Though there is an overall peril storyline, it is shadowed by the day to day issues/interactions of the crewmates aboard.<br />When it is not the topic of romance, we see many of the second string characters develop as well.  Its nice to see that the inhabitants of the 24th century have the same day to day dealings we do, and that everybody on the ship has an important role in one way or another.<br />Think of it as Melrose Place in space.  There a quite a few romantic plotlines with numerous twists that are highly entertaining and funny.  There is great chapter in which the female Vulcan, Soleta plays an unwilling ships counseler a la Deanna Troi.  Crew members want to ask her for advice on the topic of love, and being Vulcan.., well you can imagine the dry logic she expresses and finally subcumbs to frustration.  Very funny.	1998-07-01

Jefferson Parker, I awaited this book with great anticipation.  His previous novels were all awesome and deserve 5 stars, however, this book fell short for me.<br />Starting out with a lot of promise, it seemed to lose steam for me at about the midway point, and I was somewhat disapointed on how it was wrapped up.  I felt it was rushed towards the end, and the resolution of some of the characters personal feelings and dilema's were closed too quickly.	1998-06-23
US	52913038	R1BJVHTJ7984JM	0312915934	188169281	Little Saigon	Books	5	9	11	N	N	A surprising hit	As a reader of all T. Jefferson Parker's novels, I  held back on buying and reading this one for some time, but since I enjoyed his other books I gave this a try.<br />Boy was I happy! For me this was definetly the sleeper hit for T. Jefferson Parker.  The excitement and plot twists kept my attention.  I was really bummed to finish.  It was a great insight into the Vietnamese culture of Westminister, CA.<br />A few flashback scenes really helped explain the motivations of some of the key figures.<br />Exceptional	1998-06-23

Ever wanted to know in detail the events that led upto how Morgan Bateson and his crew got trapped in the time-loop and spit them out in the 24th century?  Well this book opens with a superb job in filling in those blanks and building the background of the characters for their ill fated journey.<br />It was especially nice to see how a displaced captain and crew, once believed to be lost, deal with their new surroundings including aged families, new technologies, and wars resolved.  Also placing their (the crewmates that is) mindset into the timeline of Jean-Luc Picard and his crew.<br />It also built up the role of what a real Star Fleet 'Hero' is, not the typical outlandish missions Kirk or Picard carved out in history, but an older man, trying to prove himself out of sheer loyalty to his crew and uniform.<br />The interaction of the Klingon plotlines was done exceptionally well, and was very amusing at times.<br />A great novel wishing this was made into a tv episode!	1998-06-23
US	52913038	R3VX07QPFABH5I	0671019163	802905261	Planet X (Star Trek: The Next Generation)	Books	2	2	3	N	N	A fun ride, but too predictable.	As a supposed continuation from a Marvel Comics one-shot, the premise seemed solid.  However, the story was very predictable.  Though the characters of Star Trek were portrayed well, I thought that the X-men were out of character (being that I am a huge X-Men buff).<br />The other problem I had was the choice of X-Men.  Though Wolverine, Archangel and Storm are among the popular X-men, Shadowcat and Colossus are second or even third stringers making an unusual combination for Marvel's mutants.  I would have rather have seen Cyclops or even Iceman.<br />If Mr. Friedman understood the individual powers of each of the X-men, I think better situations/scenario's could have been written for them and how they would have interacted with crew of the Enterprise.	1998-06-19
US	52913038	R3DFZVPBI4NV5B	0446603163	757081294	Zia Summer	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A solid southwestern mystery that kept me guessing	Zia Summer started off with a classic gruesome murder, and kept the reader guessing the whole time on who was behind it right alongside the main character, Sonny Baca.<br />Though the book had a few slow points from time to time, I always looked forward to the next chapter.<br />The story is also peppered with an unusual and highly identifiable cast of characters; each one to the readers liking.<br />My only complaints were to make the book more 'authentic' the author sprinkled the dialouge with Spanish slang that may confuse readers on what the characters are talking about.<br />Also the end was a bit anti-climatic, but all around very good.	1998-06-19

Poor character development	The first few chapters took some time to get into, but when the opening action plot begins it looks as to be a very promising read.  But alas, character development is slow, and many 2nd string characters are barely utilized, and open ended plot threads are dealt with too quickly or not at all towards the end of the book.  Too bad Clancy did not write this himself, had a lot of potential.	1998-02-03
