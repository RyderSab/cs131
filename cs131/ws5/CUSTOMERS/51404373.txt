Here he argues that the guy caught by the British and buried (later cremated) after committing suicide in May 1945 may not have been Heinrich Himmler but a near look-a-like Heinrich Hitzinger.  The Himmler of this book is not the Hitler sychophant but a scheming, power hungry warlord who accepted the war was lost as early as 1943 and laid plans to succeed his master by treachery if necessary.  Thomas argues that the devious Himmler, who amassed a huge personal fortune via SS income, would not have been so stupid as to fall into the hands of the British so soon after hostilities ceased.  The chapters range far and wide and include discussion of the goings-on in the British legation in Stockholm as well as the part played by spies such as Philby and Blunt.  It's interesting stuff, but is it convincing?  This reviewer does not think so.  Sometimes Thomas actually misleads.  Thus he argues that Himmler during the war never wore the horn rimmed spectacles seen in the presumed death photographs after he swallowed poison.  This is patently untrue.  You have only to flick, for example, through Martin Mansson's pictorial chronicle of the Reichsfuhrer for lots of wartime photos of him with hornrimmed glasses.  Another problem is that some of the key source material in Thomas' book is not verifiable, being unpublished theses or private information or rumours from published secondary sources.  The author casts doubt on the dental charts from the first British autopsy, claiming they are not Himmler's, but the argument is not proven.  The British records on Himmler's death will not be publicly released until 2045 which allows Thomas to smell a conspiracy.  And that's the point.  If you enjoy conspiracies, you're gonna love this book.  But whether it's fiction or non fiction is another matter.  Never mind, it's a brisk and enjoyable read.	2002-03-16

The author has attempted a photographic album of Himmler's life from his youth to his death.  There are several hundred photos, the majority taken during the war and emphasizing the Reichsfuhrer's frequent military inspections on the home, eastern and western fronts.  Whatever you think of Himmler he certainly kept himself busy.  Some of the photos show Himmler with other personalities of the period, including second raters such as Anton Mussert, the Dutch collaborator, as well as senior SS personnel including Karl Wolff and Sepp Dietrich. It is fair to say the contents are not completely comprehensive, although some prints have not been available publicly before. But there is little record here of Himmler's domestic life, for example, which was visually quite well represented in Peter Padfield's biography.<BR> The interest of the book is that nobody before has compiled a visual history of Himmler.  He was obviously very conscious of the presence of photographers and usually maintained that official inane grin under all circumstances.  Here and there he is caught off guard, for example trying to dodge the camera when too close to Hitler who is handing out awards. If you always thought that the shortsighted Himmler was not overtly photogenic, this book will confirm that belief.<BR> Unfortunately, the book shows signs of being rushed into print without thorough editing.  The text accompanying the photos is sometimes quaint, such as the ambiguous suggestion on page 233 that Himmler's adjutants were released several years after the war \\"due to their membership in the SS.\\"  A number of the photos are undated and the later sections are a bit of a chronological jumble.  All in all, this is a book for the collector who wants lots of photos of Himmler between two covers.	2002-02-02

Guido Knopp has given us six psychologial pen portraits (not biographies) of leaders of the Third Reich - Goebbels, Goring, Himmler, Hess, Speer and Donitz. He will have no truck with the argument that Hitler was a weak, lazy or disinterested dictator.  Rather, the henchmen portrayed in this book took their orders directly from the fuhrer.  Knopp writes, &quot;The Reich's murderous existence depended solely on him.  Without him, it became a ship of the dead.&quot;  Although the author has included some new material from British and Russian archives, the analysis of the characters does not break a lot of new ground (how could it?) although this reviewer was interested in Knopp's account that Speer may have returned to the Berlin bunker in late April 1945 to dissuade Hitler from appointing him as successor.  The author's strength lies in putting these nazi leaders properly in context. He shows up very well the inconsistencies in Himmler's character which made him both a yes man and, ultimately, a traitor.  Donitz by contrast was made of sterner stuff - he went on fighting for supplies and raw materials long after there was anything to distribute. If you want a summary of what made these men tick, interspersed with wry contemporary comments from their colleagues, Knopp's book is well worth studying. When Goring told Hitler in 1939, &quot;We've got to stop going for broke,&quot; Hitler replied, &quot;All my life I've gone for broke.&quot; Those few words aptly sum up the leadership problem of the Third Reich.	2001-08-13

The expression 'virus' rather suggests an analysis of how Hiterlism still infects the body politic.  Up to a point, that is right.  Wyden (who died before completing the text) does consider ultra right movements such as Haider's in Austria and is adroit in considering the continuing fascination for the Fuhrer amongst tourists and skinheads.  But those references hardly add up to a comprehensive treatment.  The author is far more successful in tracing the post war political careers or influence of card carrying nazis, for example Remer (who saved the regime in the failed July 1944 coup)and a veritable tribe of unpunished former SS who popped up all over the world in new guises. For my money, this book illustrates that Hitler's influence has certainly persisted since 1945 without really telling us why or to what end.  Perhaps those loathsome internet hate groups have some of the answers.	2001-07-07

Although Herman is well aware of the senator's failings - naive trust in Roy Cohn and David Schine who brought him down, awesome tactlessness, alcoholism - the author has done an excellent job in giving us a more balanced portrait.  The book is perhaps less a biography than an incisive analysis of McCarthy in the US political whirlwind of the 1940s and early 1950s. Chapter 17 on his legacy is quite brilliant.  The senator emerges as a man who was rightly concerned with communist infiltration in government, but lacked the overall political skills to avoid being damned in the longer term. Herman's detailed grasp of recently released primary sources, on Alger Hiss for example, is convincingly used.  And where there are still legal doubts - on the odd case of Annie Lee Moss for instance - Herman deftly shows us McCarthy was on the right track after all. This reviewer would have liked a spot more attention to players such as Judge Kaufman, Cardinal Spellman and even FBI director Hoover, but Herman has written a brilliant revisionist tract.	2001-07-07

Starting with the re-election in 1940, Davis takes us through events until the end of 1942. His warm relationship with Churchill is convincingly drawn as is his rather naive perspective on Stalin.  His oddities, such as a leaning towards Vichy France in the early days, are not disguised.  FDR's brokering of the debate in the US between those who wanted a frontal assault on Fortress Europe and those who preferred a more cautious approach is described in brilliant detail.  The president's refusal to do much constructive about the Holocaust is explained by Davis as caution rather than personal anti-semitism.  In retrospect, we can see that FDR's achievement was to transform a recession hit US into the arsenal of democracy.  More's the pity we shall not get volume six as the author died in 1999 before he had time to write it.	2001-04-15

It's not simply that the axis were overwhelmed by bigger and superior economies. China in the 1930s had a larger economic product than Japan but none the less failed militarily.  Germany in 1941 had access to greater resources than Britain and the Soviet Union combined, but failed to bring either to heel.  The reasons were far more subtle and included in Ovary's view moral dimensions as well as technology, leadership and military mistakes.  The biggest strength of the book is probably Ovary's conviction that there was nothing inevitable about the outcome.  If only Germany had spent less on technological innovations, such as the V1 and the V2, and had made sure his forces had sufficient petrol driven equipment, things might have turned out differently. Ovary in typical style has written a book of great interest to the historian and the general reader alike.	2001-04-08

Hitler's strategic mistake is dated as April 21 1941 as the Balkans campaigns were winding down. He had decided to attack Crete rather than Malta which meant that the Mediterranean theater was doomed to be a sideshow as he prepared to attack Russia directly. Once Hitler had decided on a two front war with Britain still defiant and with America in the wings, the author says, the war was irrevocably lost. The book also covers Hitler's other blunders, although there is a lot of straightforward military narrative - particularly on the Eastern Front - which could perhaps have been pruned.  There is some analysis in the book which was new to this reviewer, including Hitler's nonsensical interest in capturing the Azores, the Canaries and the Cape Verde Islands whose strategic value he greatly overestimated.  Bevin Alexander's interpretation of his theme is an interesting contrast with Richard Ovary's book on why the allies won.	2001-04-08

It has stood the test of time very well although, inevitably, some material is a bit out of date, for example on ENIGMA.  Still, the volume stands as a thorough analysis of the whole panoply of intelligence with which nazi Germany fought world war two. And no-one today would dispute the findings about why Germany performed so badly in the secret war.  Hitler underestimated Russia, awaited the Sicily landings in the Balkans and fell for thinking that the Normandy landings were a feint.  As Khan makes clear,  the nazi high command underestimated intelligence, thinking that only tanks, armies and airplanes mattered to achieve a result.  Hitler in particular was unjustifiably arrogant and failed to fund properly spying activities in foreign countries.  It was not until mid 1942 that all mail transiting through Germany was opened as a matter of routine.  Obviously, German intelligence did have its successes, say in penetrating Resistance movements in occupied Europe and in the early Atlantic U boat campaigns;  Doenitz was one of the few nazi leaders to understand the importance of spying. But the hierarchical political structure of the Reich and the disdain of the officer class failed to capitalize on secret information which could have made the war's result more problematical.	2000-12-02

It does not claim to say a lot new yet is full of original insight.  It seems to be about personalities yet successfully impacts major themes such as fascism, communism, the New Deal and the Depression across three continents.  Brendon has a particular skill in cutting 'great men' down to size.  We learn, for example, that Mosley's diatribes printed in his newspaper Action were juxtaposed with unrelated articles such as, &quot;Will eels show us where lost continents lay?&quot; Pierre Laval, on an official visit to Berlin in 1931, slipped out for frankfurters and spent several hours walking up and down Unter den Linden trying to get rid of chronic indigestion.  Not that the author's purpose is remotely trivial.  He describes how the old liberal order collapsed in the 1930s thanks to the first world war and the communist revolution in Russia.  He is as at ease dealing with the New Deal in the USA or the Ukrainian Famine.  Inevitably the reader can argue with some of his conclusions - for example on the significance of Appeasement - but there is surely no better summary of what happened,and why, in the panorama which preceded the second world war.	2000-12-02

Since the author was dependent on published sources and was denied access to the private correspondence of both Diana and Sir Oswald, it is up to the reader to take a view on the macro issues.  Was Diana a fully fledged fascist?  Well, up to a point, but she would have been against the Holocaust had she known of it in the 1940s.  Or so we are led to believe.  So maybe it's best to describe Diana as a drawing-room fascist.   She was one of the very, very few people to have known quite well both Hitler and Churchill, yet she seems to have distanced herself from politics for the most part.  In an interesting sidelight, we learn that Churchill wrote to the governor of Holloway, where she was imprisoned under the 18b regulations, suggesting she could take more baths than were allowed to other prisoners.  This offer she rightly refused. Yet, in this biography, you never feel you know Diana intimately.  She is usually publicly aloof, intensely private and obviously forever loyal to Sir Oswald.  Her later life, following her husband's death in 1980, is very sketchily described. Dalley's study is an interesting gallop through a fascinating life.  The dynamics of family life are the strongest point.  But it will be left to future studies to analyse fully Diana's personal impact on the turbulent times she witnessed and, perhaps, helped to mould.	2000-12-01

Michael Burleigh has written a most scholarly, and yet richly readable, new history of the Third Reich.  It is &quot;new&quot; in the sense that he combines a theoretical approach - nazism as a pseudo religious force in its mass appeal inside and outside Germany - with abundant material on the lives of everyday people.  His chapter headings are thematic, rather than strictly chronological, and include sub sections such as &quot;See You In Siberia&quot; and &quot;The Generals Who Dithered&quot;. The nazi attempts to dominate and exploit the economic life of Europe and beyond are particularly well discussed. The volume is a useful contrast with Ian Kershaw's recent, excellent biography of Hitler since Burleigh has written a more international account: his particular remit is to analyse the impact of nazism as a huge political force across frontiers.  He is impressively adroit in tracing the pro and anti nazi sentiment in eastern Europe and Russia. There is, for instance, some fascinating insight into the Tatars of the Ukraine who were deported by Stalin's police in cattle truck journeys lasting up to three months. The author's final chapter covers the years 1943 to 1948 where it is explained that denazification had a short life from 1945 since the allies and the Russians soon had much greater global problems to address.  There are a few slips in the text, for example the main Nuremburg war criminals were not hanged &quot;at dawn&quot; (page 804), and this reviewer felt that nazi and anti nazi media propaganda could tell us more of the international dimension than is revealed in the book. None the less, this is an insightful tome, full of sound judgments and interesting sidelights on virtually every page.  Just for the record, Burleigh has no truck with revisionist sentiments about the personalities and policies of the Reich.  Here is the story of a criminal gang who brought Europe to its knees.	2000-11-13

The author has not set out to provide a new thesis, still less a revisionist stance, but provides a meticulously researched account of Hitler's successes followed by his slide into total defeat. He has used recently available source material, especially Goebbels, and livens up his narrative by pertinent statements of ordinary Germans who lived through the second world war.  Kershaw's judgments are always sane.  We learn that the British escape at Dunkirk was Hitler's military blunder, not some halfbaked attempt to encourage the peacemakers in London.  The author is rightly suspicious that the Russians found and performed an autopsy on the Fuhrer's corpse.  What comes across strongly in this book is Hitler's obsession with secrecy which probably explains why massacres and atrocities were rarely debated in Hitler's presence. At the end, Hitler was totally obsessed by treason and betrayal. Even Goebbels, it appears, tried to persuade him to make peace with Stalin.  The index to the book is excellent and makes specific inquiries that much easier to track down.  Some of the lesser known photographs appear to be stills from Die Deutsche Wochenshau. This volume is a thorough and up to date investigation of what made Hitler tick and how and why he ultimately failed to achieve his military goals.	2000-10-31

If you hate 'em, or if love letters make you reach for a stiff drink, don't bother. The remarkably personal letters, written over a 40 year period,help set the historical record straight.  Nancy was undoubtedly the secret of Ronnie's success in life and his pillar of strength during his presidency in the 1980s. Sincerity oozes from each and every one of them. Perhaps the most moving section is the narrative of the 1990s and the sensitivity of the Alzheimer's issue. After all, Ronnie is the most famous guy in history to have the degenerative disease.  His family's suffering has made us all much more aware of the medical dimension.  If you are sentimental, the final two pictures showing Ronnie in 1998 and 2000, will bring a tear to your eye.	2000-10-22

As the Reich began to disintigrate in the autumn of 1944, Himmler set up the Werewolves to spread terror and destruction behind allied lines. They are not known to have achieved much, although they did assassinate the mayor of Aachen (who surrendered to the Americans), decapitate some GIs with tripwires and pour sugar into some Russian petrol tanks.  Danish born author Ib Melchior served in US army counterintelligence during world war two, and has adopted a fictional approach to telling the Werewolf story.  He says, however, it is based on fact. The most sensational claim is that there was a nazi plot to asassinate Eisenhower.  The book is a well paced read from both the US and the German perspective.  However, given that the events are in April 1945, there is remarkably little atmosphere of Gotterdammerung.  And there are some historical mistakes.  His claim that the SS were gassing and burning Jews at Dachau(!)at this late stage of the war is certainly mythical. The book was originally published in 1972, but the new 2000 edition has a more recent prologue.  The epilogue contains a translated account of original Werewolf inspired documents. The organization may have failed - Germany was already in chaos -  but the intentions were deadly serious.	2000-10-22

Inspired orator he may have been, but his writings are very dull. We now know that Mein Kampf was not widely read from cover to cover in nazi Germany. His private dinner time conversations, the subject of this book, are in the same mould.  The English translation of table talk has been around since 1953, but Hugh Trevor Roper has written a new and incisive preface to the latest edition.  The historical interest of Hitler's lectures to his intimate companions such as Bormann (who had them taken down in dictation) and Himmler - they were hardly conversations - is the light shed on Hitler himself. He rambles on about every subject under the sun, even leather shorts and &quot;common sense&quot;, on one occasion even arguing that Jesus was obviously not a Jew since other Jews would never have handed him over to the Romans if he had been. Here and there he says something interesting, on Petain and Laval for example, but it's mostly mundane stuff.  The table talk is mostly from 1941 and 1942.  Very little has survived here from the later stages of the war. A useful consequence of this book is that you finally lay it down knowing the truth about why this egotistical and condescending dictator lost a world war.  He spent too much time at dinner parties. And that's why this reviewer gave Hitler a generous four stars out of five.	2000-10-22

The notion that Martin Bormann was a Russian spy, codenamed Werther, has been around a long time, but this book has to be considered the definitive case for the prosecution.  At best, the evidence is hazy.  The author stresses that Bormann had unrestricted access to the minutes of Hitler's military meetings once his (Bormann's) stenographers started to take the minutes in 1942.  There is speculation on Bormann's address book which, it is claimed, has one curious entry perhaps relating to Red Army spy 'Lucy'.  Much of the book is devoted to German reverses on the eastern front, so maybe battles such as Stalingrad and Kursk were influenced by the fact that the Russians knew what the Germans were going to do next. On the other hand, there are some factual errors in the book, on Zhukov for example, and Bormann's actual role and importance in the nazi hierarchy are surprisingly patchy. If Bormann's remains had never been found in Berlin, it might be easier to argue Kilzer's thesis which would work better if the henchman had actually escaped or disappeared without trace.  As it is, one is reluctantly drawn to the conclusion the case is not proven.  Neither for that matter was he whisked out of Berlin in 1945 by British secret agents to spend his retirement in South Coast tearooms, nor endure his post war years in South America before succombing to liver cancer as argued in other accounts. We need to remember that Bormann was a drunkard by the mid war years.  To place him at the center of a complex communist conspiracy, for whatever reason, is a tremendous claim.  In fact, the pill is just too big to swallow.	2000-10-18

The author's intention to analyse a complex subject, whilst at the same time entertaining the general reader, has succeeded in this excellent book.  His view that the generals and OKW shared willingly in Hitler's military blunders - post war memoirs tend to be disingenious - is not in itself new.  However, Megargee has assembled the primary evidence in a convincing and comprehensive form.  As he argues, there is no significant evidence that the High Command seriously opposed the Fuhrer's declaration of war on Russia or America in 1941.  Indeed, they took a most simplistic view of Russia's strength and America's likely impact over time. Detailed here too are Hitler's poor attention to strategic planning and military intelligence.  In the Gotterdammerung phase of the war, the author has an excellent chapter on Hitler's insistence on promoting men wildly above their ability just because they were loyal. Himmler's dismal showing as a military commander is the best example of this.  The book is a most readable insight into the mind set of those who led Germany to defeat in a flawed system.	2000-10-16

However, this is far and away the most comprehensive to appear.  The many contributors cover the historical, sociological and psychological aspects in rigorous and scholarly style.  This reviewer would pick out as particularly insightful Aleksander Lasik's analysis of the SS at the camp,whose numbers grew steadily as the war progressed,and Nathan Cohen for a gripping account of the diaries of the Sonderkommando which were found near the crematoria at Birkenau.  Since the book is over 600 pages of closely argued text, it is in effect a work of reference.  Fortunately, the index appears to be very good and following up subjects or characters is not difficult. There are, incidentally, two themes not really tracked here: holocaust revisionism debates nor Auschwitz as portrayed in the mass media.  The editors, no doubt sensibly, have instead revealed what made Auschwitz tick and how perpetrators and victims related to their gruesome environment.	2000-10-13

It is indeed a meticulously researched account of the life of Hirohito.  Bix writes convincingly of the successful attempts, by Americans as well as by Japanese, to ensure Hirohito avoided a trial for war crimes and remained an anti-communist symbol of national unity. He also brings forward a mass of material to illustrate that the emperor was intimately involved in Japan's military policy in the 1930s and early 1940s. Although the general reader is hardly in a position to check first hand all Bix's primary source claims, it is the small details which stick in your mind: the special naval uniform Hirohito wore as Japan attacked the US navy in December 1941 and the private grief he expressed when Tojo was hanged in 1948. Bix has made it impossible for anyone seriously now to regard the emperor as a mere cypher or a victim of war Cabinet decisions. He needed a debunk in the English language and he has gotten precisely that.	2000-09-28

This is the most comprehensive book yet to appear which seeks to refute the claims of Holocaust deniers and revisionists.  It seeks to put the  nature of historical &quot;truth&quot; in a semi-philosophical framework as  well as tackling the empirical claims of deniers head on.  There is a  strong section attacking Fred Leuchter's so-called research on the bricks  at the Auschwitz crematoria (no wonder no traces of cyanide remain after 50  years in the open air) and a thorough account of the nazis' own  incriminating records and confessions. Will the book actually convince any  Holocaust deniers themselves?  Probably not.  They will doubtless pin-prick  the book, for example Heydrich's death at one point is wrongly given as  1943.  And they will continue to maintain that Eichmann's confessions in  custody were his last ditch effort to cooperate and thus save his life.  As  Sherman and Grobman make very clear, Holocaust deniers are ideologically  motivated and devoted to rehabilitation of nazism. A final thought:  the  main media organ of deniers these days is the Internet. There is still  scope for a detailed analysis of the content and impact of these hate  pages.

At one level, it reads rather like a hangman's  autobiography;  Albert Pierrepoint comes to mind.  At another, it is an  unintentional treatise against capital punishment.  It has long been  debated in Nuremburg literature whether the ten hanged nazis were properly  executed, or whether the enterprise was bungled resulting in slow  strangulation.  Stanley Tilles, surfacing in print after more than fifty  years, doesn't really settle the argument.  He regards chief executioner  Sergeant Woods as an experienced professional and explains there is nothing  unusual about an unconscious hanged man's heart continuing to beat for  several minutes.  On the other hand, he confides that Woods particularly  disliked Jew baiter Julius Streicher and adjusted his noose off center so  that he died in agony.  There is not a lot of new information in this book,  except perhaps on Sergeant Woods himself who apparently died later in USA  after being struck by lightning. Perhaps the main value of the book is the  light it sheds on how the US army chose its hangmen and execution  admininistrators.	2000-09-05

There are coherently arranged sections such as race and  anti-semitism in nazi ideology, Jewish leadership and resistance, the  rescuers and the survivor experience. The essays, written by a large number  of contributors, are mostly in-depth and richly sourced studies.  This  reviewer found particularly insightful Louise London's account of the  British government's response to German treatment of the Jews and Randolph  Braham's summary of the holocaust in Hungary.  Inevitably, the anthology  has become a little outdated.  Sources from former Soviet satellite  countries are shedding new light on some issues and, in my opinion,  holocaust denial arguments (however spurious) need more treatment in a book  claiming to be a summary of &quot;where we are and where we need to  go.&quot;	2000-07-31

This is a remarkable study in the practical morality of collaboration and of resistance.  Rab Bennett shows clearly how these terms have been over-simplified in many previous studies of the second world war. The  reader is invited to put herself or himself into the position of partisans  who had to weigh up the economic value of sabotage against the certainty  that reprisals would be enormous. Or the mother in a concentration camp who  had the choice of either hiding her own newly born baby and inviting the  murder of the other inmates in the hut, or herself killing it in order to  save lives. Given the nazi policy of effectively holding whole populations  as hostages for the good behaviour of individuals, the choices on offer  were well nigh morally impossible. The author has succeeded in illustrating  for the general reader the issues which faced ordinary women and men on the  ground.  He also makes plain that murder and atrocity were also used by  resisters against Germans especially as the Reich empire crumbled from  1943. This is an excellent account of the moral dilemmas which formed the  basis of German rule of subject populations.	2000-07-08

The originality of this book is to illustrate (in both senses) anti Jewish pogroms and the death camps from the viewpoint of the Germans involved. Some, like the truck driver from technical battalion six, simply witnessed  atrocities in the Ukraine.  Others such as Willi Mentz (the Gunman of  Sobibor), were actively involved in the slaughter in the camps. So far as I  am aware, there are some original photos here showing nazi personnel at  leisure whilst off duty in the camps.  Perhaps it was deliberate, but there  is no conclusion to the book. The idea could be to let the letters, diaries  and reports speak for themselves.	2000-07-02

This is an extremely well written (and translated) insight into what made nazi Germany tick.  The author's skill lies in his adroit use of paradigms or frameworks of assumptions within which his scholarly insight shines  forth.  For example, he shows clearly how the four powers that dominated  society - state bureaucracy, the nazi party, business bosses and the army -  changed with the advent of war. In general, the power of the party and of  the business leaders grew after 1940 whereas the army high command and the  state bureaucrats lost ground as defeats multiplied. His account of nazi  propaganda is succinct but revealing. Thus he illustrates, through SD  reports and other sources, how Goebbels' official line that Germans did not  commit atrocities was often refuted by ordinary people's experience on both  the war and the home fronts. This is not an introductory guide to the power  structures of the Reich, but a masterful and semi sociological review of  why and how Hitler's Germany took the course it did. And why its many  contradictions were a key element in its eventual demise.	2000-07-01

At the time, there was press speculation whether the  extreme right in Britain was becoming electorally acceptable.  As this book  makes clear, fascism or neo fascism has never stood any in the British  electoral system.  In spite of claiming to be ultra nationalist, many of  its roots lie in foreign movements, especially unpopular Hitlerism.  Some  of its &quot;clothes&quot;, such as anti immigrant fervour, were stolen by  the established parties or off-shoots from them (eg The Monday Club). As  the book makes plain, fascist leaders themselves have often understood  their dilemma.  Mosley frequently reflected that Britain had never suffered  a serious enough economic crisis to overthrow established parties.  The  book has not apparently been updated since 1996 and is useful only as an  historical summary. There is, for example, nothing on Internet hate groups  and virtually nothing on holocaust denial which are now the mainstay of  ultra right fringe political groups in UK.	2000-05-25

Jay Baird reviews the nazi martyrs, such as Horst Wessel and Herbert Norkus, and uses them to explain how the concept of immolation and self sacrifice was so central to the Hitler era.  Poets such as Gerhard Schumann  are also treated, though there is little on art, sculpture and  architecture.  Nazi heroes  themselves owed much to Germany's mythical past  (the Teutonic forests and all) which was especially loved by Himmler who  saw himself as a reincarnation of the medieval ruler Henry The Fowler.   There is an insightful concluding chaper on the myth of death in the second  world war.  As the Reich crashed into ruins, Goebbels was still proudly  glorifying self sacrifice in his movie epic Kolberg. In this way, nazism  sought to equate noble death as the moral equivalent of victory. However,  to what extent all this propaganda really influenced the man in the street  would make another and equally interesting book.	2000-05-25

You can discover which was the first car to have airconditioning or how many rooms there are at Buckingham palace.

Last  reprinted in 1998, there is not much material specifically relevant to the  last ten years or so.  This gives some of the chapers a dated look, for  example on the cinema or TV.

Any book with the word &quot;Useless&quot; in the title can hardly be criticized for content.  But this is actually a surprisingly tasteful dip into what the human race has been doing in and out of bed since the year  dot.  Chapter titles such as The Unkindest Cut Of All, Animal Lust and  Sexual Healing say it all. How the author actually knows that reproductive  women have sex three thousand times on average in their life or that  Casanova ate fifty oysters for breakfast is not made clear.  However,  Cosmopolitan magazine is mentioned as a source more than once.  There are  many memorable one liners here.  When Gore Vidal was asked if the first  person he had sex with was male or female, he apparently replied that he  had been too polite to ask.

A most excellent insight.  The author deals mainly with the period September 1939 to the Wannsee meeting in January 1942, making use of new material which has come to light.  He illustrates with meticulous attention  to detail how those entrusted with the grisly task - Himmler, Heydrich,  Eichmann, Frank etc - moved inexorably to their final position of Jewish  extermination. The problems they had to deal with en route, including  opposition from those who wanted to keep the Jews alive for indefinite  slave labor and the economic expectancy of those Germans recently moved  from &quot;liberated&quot; territories back to the Reich, are recounted in  all their complex detail.  The final chapter gives a selection of pertinent  remarks from the murderers themselves.

As new written sources from the early 1940s continue to turn up regularly in Russia and in its former Soviet satellites, historians are able to refine the history of the Jewish holocaust.  Christopher Browning is at the  forefront of this academic work.  In his latest book, based on a series of  lectures, he has a close look at when senior nazidom actually determined on  a policy of destruction.  He convincingly argues it was October 1941. There  is an excellent chapter on Starachowice labor camp in Poland in which  survivor memories and new documentary evidence are shown to be  complementary.  For those who want a followup to Browning's previously  published work, for example on reserve police batallion 101, there is a  final chapter in which the author slightly modifies his previous  conclusions on the mindset of the killers.  I think it is fair to say that  this scholarly book is meant for advanced students of the holocaust, or at  least those with a fair knowledge of the historiography.	2000-05-22

This is a carefully researched and well written study of what holocaust deniers and revisionists have been saying and writing since the late 1940s.  Ms Lipstadt makes very clear their political agendas, sometimes hidden and  sometimes not, such as anti-semitism and the political rehabilitation of  nazism.  Of course, a lot has happened since the book's publication in  1994: changes in the law on racial incitement and holocaust denial, the  unsuccessful lawsuit of David Irving, amongst others, and the huge  expansion of hate sites on the internet.  Indeed, the internet is now  (unlike in 1994) the main media outlet for those wishing to deny the  existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz or claiming that allied crimes were  worse than nazi ones.  The author suggests rightly that holocaust deniers  will increasingly try to find a respectable and intellectual image for  their claims.  This the net allows them to do.  It is perhaps desirable  that a revised edition of this book appears soon to analyse more recent  developments. Ms Lipstadt's account of the odd careers of many deniers,  such as self-styled expert on gas chambers Fred Leuchter, is masterful.  She really does know her enemies.	2000-05-17

This is a non-revised paperback version of a biography which first appeared in the late 1970s.  The author spent six years working on the archives and the result is a very detailed treatment of Hitler's master  spy.  Canaris emerges as a Janus or two faced figure.  Early in the war, he  undoubtedly achieved a number of spy coups.  However, he also had to take  responsibility for several &quot;botched&quot; expeditions such as the  unsuccessful attempts to land German spies in the USA.  Following the death  of his erstwhile friend Heydrich, SS leaders such as Kaltenbrunner tried to  break up Canaris' spy network and place it under Gestapo control.  Canaris  was dismissed in March 1944, but retained faith that Hitler would  rehabilitate him. He was eventually hanged for alleged complicity in the  July 1944 plot to kill the Fuhrer.  Canaris certainly had links with  anti-Hitler factions, but his actual role is still ambiguous. His  conscience and loyalties prevented him from being in the forefront of  opposition.  Author Heinz Hohne is meticulous but is not an easy read.  Nor  does he offer a chapter of conclusions on this enigmatic character.	2000-05-10

In spite of having a context of sociological theory, this is a racy even humorous tour of the subject from the 1930s to the 1980s.  There are a number of themes, for example the projection of gays on the screen as a  threat to &quot;normal&quot; family values and the links between violence  and sexual difference.  Here and there the author may be over the top. Thus  the notion of the Frankenstein monster having a physical relationship with  the blind hermit or, in a later film with Ygor, will not be believed by  all. But Benshoff would not claim to be uncontroversial.  And he is  certainly right in his conclusion that horror movies are influential in  defining gay sub culture more generally.

Zvi Aharoni knows from personal experience the inside story of Eichmann's capture and has given us the definitive insight. The description of the trial, however, is less detailed.  A lot of myths are laid to rest. For example the SS criminal on the run never tried to disguise his identity  after capture contrary to other accounts and movies.  Nor did he speak the  Hebrew language as has sometimes been claimed by apologists.  But the  over-riding lesson of this spy story is how it all very nearly went wrong.   The undercover agents made the mistake of pretending to be estate agents  when visiting Eichmann's neighbor and their cover was very nearly blown.  Eichmann himself was surprisingly careless about his personal security in  Buenos Aires even though he knew the Israelis were planning to capture him.  It is an interesting sidelight that he and his family lived poorly in a  house without electricity or fresh water supplies.  If organizations such  as Odessa had plenty of nazi gold in South America, Eichmann certainly  never saw much of it after his arrival there. Apparently, he was the only  man executed in Israel since 1947. In the worst sense of the term, Eichmann  was indeed a special case.	2000-04-29

This is an unusual book on France's purge of its collaborators during the German occupation.  By focussing on novelist and critic Robert Brasillach, Alice Kaplan tells us as much about literature as about politics.  By the  standards of today, Brasillach's propagandist work is naive.  His  glorification of the Reich, for example in Je Suis Partout of which he was  editor in chief until 1943, is hopelessly romantic (even managing to quote  Virgil in support) and bore no relationship to the experiences of ordinary  French people living under the occupation.  He seems to have been part of a  pro nazi, elite homosexual coterie who found in fascism an outlet for their  love of uniforms and male bonding.  Kaplan has explored in depth the trial  records and notes that Brasillach's insistence on rambling on for days  ensured his death sentence.  He would have done better to have remained  silent.  It is argued that he has become a martyr for the extreme right in  French politics, but this thesis not really stretched beyond references to  John Marie Le Pen's admiration.  One is left with the feeling that  Brasillach, like Vidkun Quisling in another context, left a weaker legacy  than he thought he would.  The complete lack of photographs, apart from a  blowup on the dust jacket, gives the impression this book will largely have  a specialist readership.	2000-04-23

The most interesting aspects of the book are whether  Hitler's illnesses and mental obessions caused him to lose the war.   Probably not is the general conclusion, although the debate will go on.   Some silly opinions, that Dr Morell tried to poison his Fuhrer or that  Hitler eventually went mad, are carefully dismissed in this detailed  account.  Hitler's sexuality, by the way, remains something of a mystery.	2000-04-19

In his preface, the author says he was moved to write this book by observing first hand during a 1946 train journey the skeletal remains of  German cities. It is, of course, difficult not to feel sympathy for the  600,000 plus civilians who died in the Reich under a hail of enemy bombs,  mortars and bullets.  The author tells a vivid tale of cellar life, cold  and misery as the nazi regime crumbled and collapsed in an orgy of  destruction. The account is more impersonal than, for example, Cornelius  Ryan's &quot;When The Kissing Had To Stop&quot; which described the last  days of Hitler's Berlin from the vantage point of the citizens themselves.  The author speculates, but does not answer, how the citizens of US cities  today would respond to utter devastation of their environment.  Given the  very different nature of warfare today, and our dependence on cyberspace  for communications, it is a question well worth debating.	2000-04-15

Nicholas Atkin has written a succinct biography of the Marshall which covers all the major controversies about his unlikely life.  Although the author has little sympathy with the viewpoint of loyalists who have sought  to justify Vichy, there is enough insight here for the general reader to  understand why the Marshall personally remained popular long after his  policy of collaboration with Germany had obviously failed. The book is  excellent in persuading that Petain's policies in office from 1940 were  largely conditioned by his previous life. For example, his naive trust in  family values and rural work were a result of his traditional upbringing in  the Pas de Calais. His military success at Verdun caused him to misjudge  the value of defensive lines against the German attack in the second world  war. The collapse of Vichy in 1944 and the post war trial are treated  rather sketchily.  The final review chapter on the man and the myth is a  first rate balancing act in the historiography of this highly unusual  dictator.	2000-04-15

Eric Johnson's skill is to have made us understand how the Gestapo actually operated at local level without falling into the trap of identifying with the police organization. We learn, for example, that  senior Gestapo were usually law graduates with a comparatively small number  of officers.  They relied to a great extent on third party informants often  with a grudge against someone. Target groups for the Gestapo were Jews,  churchmen and homosexuals.  But it seems most &quot;ordinary&quot; German  citizens had little to fear from the secret police even when they indulged  in that most favorite of pastimes - listening in to the BBC.  Gestapo  oppression was very real but also selective and even passive on occasion.  This reviewer would have liked a little more background on how the Cologne  Gestapo, the subject of the study, related to their bosses in Berlin.  An  insightful study of the &quot;Little Eichmanns&quot; who abounded in the  Third Reich.  The book is all the more convincing as Johnson has conducted  research in the 1990s on what elderly Germans remember about the events  under discussion.	2000-04-08

In a careful analysis, Tim Cole suggests that the actual holocaust is not be confused with the atrocities depicted in museums and movies.  He argues, for example, that the movie Schindler's List blurs historical reality by emphasizing the &quot;goodness&quot; of Schindler himself and the happy  outcome for the Jewish captives in his Czech factory in 1945. We all have  to feel fine when leaving the cinema.  Actually, much the same could be  said about other movies not considered by Cole, for example Triumph of the  Spirit which recounts the survival at Auschwitz of a Greek boxer.  The  author also feels that the establishment of so many holocaust memorials and  museums may actually stimulate Revisionism by allowing holocaust deniers to  pinpoint inaccuracies, for example of the Auschwitz (One) gas chamber is  indeed a post war reconstruction for tourists.  There is much well  researched detail in this book, for example on Anne Frank whose Amsterdam  house has become just another site for the curious and on Oskar Schindler  himself who fled at the end of the war with his wife and mistress (contrary  to the movie portrayal).  It is Cole's honesty in showing up many holocaust  myths that makes the book a convincing read.  He is no apologist for nazi  crimes, but he has opened an important debate about perception and reality  in the mass media.	2000-03-24

The received view about German saboteurs in US and in UK is that they were all captured soon after arrival on foreign soil, then executed or turned into double agents  The author makes out a fair case that this was far from  the truth. The most interesting case is perhaps that of Hans Hansen who  parachuted into England in 1940 and appears to have fooled British  Intelligence right up to 1945.  There are also some intriguing accounts in  the book about nazi spies in Latin America, the IRA connection with the  Abwehr and the double dealing of FBI director J Edgar Hoover who  continually overstated his own success.  One caution: the bibliography  contains only secondary sources. An excellent read rather than a work of  scholarship.	2000-03-22

Charles Whiting has written some great books on world war two.  This reviewer did not find Werewolf one of his best.  It describes the establishment of  nazi underground saboteurs working behind enemy lines in  late 1944 thru 1945. Although non fiction, the author chooses a novelesque  approach dealing with the five men and one woman who successfully murdered  Franz Oppenoff, the first German mayor of Aachen under American control.  But there is little else of substance in the book. Perhaps this reviewer  expected too much. It is accepted that Werewolf never really got off the  ground as the Reich collapsed, so maybe there is not too much to tell.  Surprising by the way that Hollywood has not turned Oppenoff's murder  (Operation Carnival) into what would be an unusual adventure pic.	2000-03-19

May look expensive, but a complete insight into the art of picture persuasion in world war two.  Most of the examples are posters and film stills from the period, supported by a written commentary of the background  and significance.  There is also a good essay on the psychological warfare  campaign against Germany after D-Day which was designed to undermine the  will to resist inside the Reich. Amongst the less well known material is a  full treatment of Japan and its largely unsuccessful campaign to win over  conquered nations, such as the Philippines, to its co-prosperity sphere.  Perhaps the underlying message is that war propaganda only succeeds when  its message is borne out by what the intended recipients see all around  them in any case.  Some images in this book, such as Colonel Blimp and  jackbooted nazis, still appear in cartoons today.  There are a few  mistakes, eg William Joyce or Lord Haw Haw was hardly a &quot;renegade  Englishman&quot; given that he was an American citizen, howbeit with an  illegally acquired British passport. Popular humor of the early 1940s is  well represented in the poster examples, although one suspects that Dr  Goebbels never really understood the British psyche.

To draw the most from this new book, you need to know already quite a bit about occupied France.  The authors trace in detail academic perceptions of Vichy since 1945.  Regime apologists tried to maintain in the 1950s that  Petain had played a clever game in seeming to collaborate whilst plotting  to maintain French independence.  We now understand this was nonsense:  Petain and Laval may have been interested in collaboration, but Hitler's  only concern was booty. But equally in error was the Gaullist position that  forty million Frenchmen supported the Resistance against a tiny number of  traitors.  The editors demonstrate that more recent research has shown how  fragmented both the pro and anti Vichy groups were.  For example, it was  possible to be faithful to Petain whilst being anti nazi.  Many ordinary  French people, both in the cities and in the countryside, adopted an  eclectic attitude according to &quot;how the wind was blowing&quot; in  their area.  The book suggests new lines for research on Vichy, especially  a comparative approach with what was happening in other occupied countries  such as Bulgaria and Hungary. The book is largely a tribute to Robert  Paxton who wrote a ground breaking study of wartime France in the 1970s.   This reviewer found the continuous adulation of Paxton, however merited,  somewhat repetitive.  You will enjoy this new volume if you really want to  explore in depth the meaning of Vichy over the past sixty years.  Given  that France was still prosecuting men for war crimes in the late 1990s,  Petain's regime is still a hotly debated topic in that country's academic  establishment.	2000-03-06

Because the name Quisling has passed into everyday language, there is a danger we sloganize the historical character.  As Dahl makes clear in this scholarly but most readable biography, Quisling was not simply a nazi yes  man.  His own ideas owed much to Christian fundamentalism and a home grown  philosophy called Universalism.  He collaborated with Hitler, whom he met  far more frequently than the head of any other conquered country, in the  hope that he could re-establish Norwegian independence after the war.  His  dawning realization that this was impossible produced personal hopelessness  and made him detested in Norway.  He had backed the wrong horse.  Dahl is  excellent in showing up both the tensions in Quisling himself and in the  ruling NS party, itself by no means united.  The minister president's own  often tortuous dealings with Terboven, the Reich's commissioner in Norway,  are particularly well described.  Once he realized he would be executed,  Quisling put forward the thesis that he would be far more dangerous after  his death than during his life.  He was wrong about that too. Outside  Norway, the family name lives on only in a US medical clinic which his  relatives once founded.  The name Quisling still means in Madison,  Wisconsin good health and well being. This masterly book is a first rate  insight into the politics of absolute failure.	2000-02-29

Overtly this is an account of radio jazz and popular music broadcast to Britain and US between 1939 and 1945.  It is indeed an excellently researched analysis of how Goebbels' ministry sought, and failed, to  undermine the enemy war effort by tuneful propaganda.  The accompanying  musical CD, featuring &quot;Charlie&quot; and his Orchestra, says it all  and additionally includes some choice bits by William Joyce or Lord Haw  Haw, including his final broadcast from Hamburg when he was plainly drunk  at the microphone.  The book also contains much insightful information on  other radio traitors such as John Amery, Axis Sally (Mildred Gillars) and  the American, Robert Best, who canvassed from Berlin his own candidacy  against President Roosevelt in the 1944 election.  There is much new  material in this book both about musical swing and the traitors in general.   It really gets under the surface of an obscure world war two subject.  The  CD itself is a real hoot!	1999-09-02
US	51404373	R30WDYBTL9PWUO	1565844394	789219397	France Under the Germans: Collaboration and Compromise	Books	3	33	34	N	Y	Reveals the many sided nature of French collaboration	Is a very scholarly analysis of how French politicians, the armed forces and figures from the serious and popular arts reacted to the various stages of the German occupation.  Without doubt, the new standard work on these  aspects which reveals how the term &quot;collaboratioon&quot; did not  necessarily mean full identification with the Reich's cause.  The author's  purpose does not include detailed treatment of the Resistance, nor will you  find much discussion of the Liberation and its consequences for the  collaborators.  However, the account of Petain, Laval, Darnard and the rest  is riveting if you want to understand all the twists and turns which  accompanied the Vichy administration in its four tramatic years.	1999-07-27

Not a biography of the Reichsfuhrer, but a carefully researched and annotated analysis of his role in the final solution. Himmler's own office logs and appointment books, where extant, are convincingly used.  The most  thorough account to date of the so called Madagscar proposal which  preoccupied the nazis in the late 1930s as a way of exiling Jews.   Himmler's often mutually suspicious dealings with underlings such as  Heydrich and Eichmann are particularly well portrayed, although his  relationship with Hitler is sometimes sketchy. The years 1944 and 1945 are  treated rather briefly, presumably because Himmler's initiatives were  mainly restricted to trying to arrange coverup of the atrocities. But  Breitman has done a first rate job in showing us how Himmler's bureaucratic  mind ticked.  The book illustrates that you don't need to be a personal  sadist to organize murder on a massive scale.	1999-07-25

Hoess reveals how a family man who loved horses could himself survive in charge of the Auschwitz complex.  Is an authentic read as Hoess blunders here and there with a faulty memory and shows self doubt as the date of his  execution nears.  Holocaust deniers will find no comfort in the book,  although it has to be said that Hoess left the camp in 1943 and that prison  memoirs are always suspect to some degree.  Hoess seems to have realized  all along that a death sentence was certain.  The argument that he admitted  mass gassings in an attempt to obtain a lighter sentence is unlikely.  But  you have to read the book to get a feel for this particular nazi whose only  aim was to please Berlin.	1999-07-25

Ousby illustrates well how early French hopes that the German treatment would be fair and correct collapsed over time. It soon transpired that the only function of France was to be a source of booty and exploitation.  Particularly insightful on the Vichy regime, Ousby is thorough on showing  up the tensions in the ranks of the collaborators and the resistance alike.	1999-07-25
