From day one, I just thought this individual was a raving looney. He kept submitting stories to me about his underwear and shorty pajamas, which really had nothing at all to do with the type of magazine I publish. My greatest fear was that \\"Ed\\" would show up unannounced on my front porch dressed in said shortie pajamas. The guy seemed kind of obsessed about his p.j.'s.  It was a great relief to find out that his submissions were actually part of a book.  <br /> <br />With that said, \\"Stories from a Moron\\" is very funny. In fact,  it gets funnier on subsequent readings (I think). \\"Ed Broth's\\" unflagging literary assaults on reality, pushing his stuff energetically at the wrongest of wrong magazine markets, over and over and over again, made me laugh so hard, my wife, who is a nurse, thought I was choking on food. <br /> <br />\\"Stories from Moron\\" is the funniest book I've read in a long time. <br /> <br />	2004-12-27

Fencing master	Books	5	8	12	N	N	KNOWLEDGE IS POWER	Some fencers approach fencing only from a physical level, but there are others among us who believe that thinking is the most important fencing skill you will ever develop. Anyone can learn to lunge, to parry, to perform a disengage. But thinking on the fencing strip is a hard-won ability, exercized by relatively few fencers today. The \\"anything-for-a-touch\\" school of fencing, which hangs its consciousness proudly on the tip of its foil, will poo-poo the necessity for the academic approach, but it is a fact that the real game of fencing goes on between your brain and your sword hand. Fencing is a highly abstract activity, and having workable, understandable definitions is a vital part of mastering the real process. This is what has made fencing a readily teachable activity for the past four hundred years. Maestro William Gaugler gives us a volume that provides many answers to the questions of \\"what is what\\" in fencing. Every fencing student should read this book. As the author of \\"THE ART AND SCIENCE OF FENCING\\" and \\"THE INNER GAME OF FENCING,\\" and the editor/publisher of \\"FENCERS QUARTERLY MAGAZINE,\\" I recommend this book highly.	2002-06-24

I'm not exactly sure I agree with his fencing philosophy in total. Some of his views on training are debateable. He was a bit too much of a generalist in his attempt to &quot;demystify&quot; and &quot;simplify&quot; fencing. He might even have been a bit of a fencing &quot;socialist.&quot; Maybe not an anarchist, but he was definitely pushing fencing's classical foundations. So, if you don't take &quot;Secrets of the Sword&quot; as a teaching manual, you'll be fine. Read it as a look into fencing's fascinating past, and you'll be fine. As the author of &quot;The Encyclopedia of the Sword,&quot; &quot;The Art and Science of Fencing,&quot; and &quot;The Inner Game of Fencing;&quot; and the Editor-in-Chief of FENCERS QUARTERLY MAGAINE, I recommend this book.	2001-01-30

In making Talhoffer's fencing book accessible to the world again, Mark Rector has provided us with an important contribution to sword knowledge. Not just for those involved in recreationist swordplay, but for anyone interested in the roots of fencing. Moreover, for many young fencers today realizing that fencing didn't begin with them might be the first step to developing some respect for the art, science, and sport of fencing -- an attribute that is sorely lacking in many sport fencing circles these days. There's a long history here that makes individuals not all that important. Fencing is bigger than the moment, bigger than egos. The traditions, skills, and mindsets span centuries. The information in this book also has applications as a working reference for anyone wishing to hone their theatrical fencing skills along historical lines. And, of course, &quot;Talhoffer&quot; should be of interest to anyone in love with things medieval. As a fencing master of thirty years, the author of &quot;The Encyclopedia of the Sword,&quot; &quot;The Art and Science of Fencing,&quot; and &quot;The Inner Game of Fencing,&quot; and the editor-in-chief of FENCERS QUARTERLY MAGAZINE, I recommend this fascinating book.	2000-12-07

Books	5	15	19	N	N	From Nick Evangelista: Author of &quot;THE INNER GAME OF FENCING&quot;	A number of beginning fencing students have mentioned to me that they believed, just by its title, that &quot;The Inner Game of Fencing&quot; might be too &quot;advanced&quot; for them. To the contrary, this book is perfect for the fencer just starting out, because its purpose is to help develop a mindset for fencing that will help guide the beginner through the mechanical development of their game. The sooner this process gets put into motion, the better. You need your brain in gear to fence well. I did not write this book to be overly complex, or to make it inaccessable except to only a few chosen individuals. I wrote it in the same manner as my &quot;The Art and Science of Fencing,&quot; in language anyone can understand. Fencing is about people -- human thoughts and human actions -- not overly complicated technicalities. It is about reason and control, which are things anyone can understand. That is what &quot;The Inner Game of Fencing&quot; deals with.	2000-10-02

This book will appeal to many in the fencing world today, those with a mindset geared specifically toward the active competitive arena, and therefore should be considered a valuable source of information for that purpose. While I happen to lean toward a more classical approach to fencing than this book professes, that is not important to this review. I recognize that many do not share my opinions about fencing (I am the author of &quot;The Art and Science of Fencing&quot; and &quot;The Inner Game of Fencing&quot;), and that's fine.

Drawing on new research that indicates similar destructive weather changes  have occured in the (geologically) recent past, the authors put together a  very readable work that expresses their concerns -- that the environmental  and meteorological conditions may be right for another such event.<br />Much  of the writing style, especially in the chapter-leading fictional accounts,  reminds me of Strieber's earlier work, WAR DAY -- a superior example of  detailed and searching speculative fiction.<br />A personal frustration for  me, as a reader, was that the references used as support for the issues  presented in the book were not footnoted -- very difficult to try to hunt  out the material for further study. It was this minor flaw that lead to the  4-star rating; had research been more clearly identified, the rating would  have been 5-star.<br />The work is clearly speculative and written for a  popular audience. Fortunately, authors are still allowed to think  independently and draw conclusions from available data, and Bell &amp;  Streiber have made a credible contribution to current speculations on  environmental change.	2000-02-22

Sure, we had ice storms, bad weather spells where we couldn't have gotten down our road in a tank, and floods that blocked passage for weeks on end.....But, I never, never, thought that some minor computer glitch could end up being the Problem of the Millennium.  In fact, up until about 18 days ago, I was proudly telling friends that the whole y2k thing was nothing more than a giant bogus media frolic, trotted out on slow news days to hook the masses so they wouldn't switch channels during commercials. I have suffered a rude awakening.  The Yourdon's book has been the route to this rather shocking turn of mind -- and it is because the book was written for ME (and those like me) who have a smattering of knowledge about computer function, but no real idea of where the y2k problem is going to lead.  Now, unfortunately, I have an idea of where it's going, and I kinda wish I was still in blissful ignorance...sorta.  Preparedness is a lifestyle, after all is said and done -- and prepared is prepared.  I just thought the calamity I was preparing for was of a more earth-changing nature, something impossibly large and grand, on the order of an asteroid or comet striking the earth.........but all it is going to be is the consequence of a series of tiny decisions made by a pack of computer nerds two decades ago.

When I bought this book, I imagined it was going to be a modern variant of &quot;Ripley's Believe it or Not.&quot; It turned out to be simply &quot;Ripley's Believe It -- Not!&quot;  The book is an awkward blend of pop-history, pop-psychology, pop-sociology, and pop-science, all tied neatly together by the kind of simple-minded philosophical discourse you'd expect to be devised during the wee hours of the night while carrying on phone conversations with self-confessed vampires, folks who have divined answers to all the secrets of the universe while in the thoes of extreme sleep deprivation and/or lack of adequate medication, women who've had sex with space aliens, and, of course, time travelers. Mr. Bell attempts to enlighten us about his discovered trend through his unique take on the news. He does this in the same manner Hal Lindsey attempted to let us know about the end of the world using the Bible in his own silly &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth.&quot; Mr. Bell is equally adept at locating the truth. Art Bell invests much specialness to our time period. No other time, apparently, has experienced as much awfulness as the present time, according to Bell. No other time is so deserving of the unknown doo-doo Bell postulates is waiting in the wings for us. Not the fifth century, with its decline into the Dark Ages; not the eleventh century, with its population upheavals and end-of-the-world fears; not the fourteenth century with its Black Death; not the nineteenth century, with its continual wars, volcanos, earthquakes, social strife, and disease. He sees his &quot;truth&quot; in every news story, every headline, in the stories his nightly guests endlessly spew out into the air waves. Perhaps this perceived &quot;quickening,&quot; this &quot;accelertation,&quot; is nothing more than the unacknowledged, but obvious, result of an increasingly successful communications network's ability to feed us instant news by the ton from every corner of the planet. News of an earthquake in Java is thrown at us instantly. A report of riots in India come to us while they are still in progress. Like all news now, bad news is continual and unrelenting. This does not mean, of course, that the events in question are imaginary, only that once upon a time we might never have known of most of them, as would have been the case for past societies, no matter how abundadant the disasters. Today, we have radio, magazines, tv, and now computers bombarding us with their outpourings. Is this a &quot;quickening,&quot; or just an advance in the way we receive our information and disinformation? Has &quot;the Quickening&quot; always been with us in one form or another? It's odd that Mr. Bell's force &quot;materializes&quot; magically in the age of the computer, that weapon of instant communication for one and all. Perhaps mythologist and philosopher Joseph Campbell hit the nail on the head when he observed, &quot;Life is perfect. It's alwats been a mess.&quot; Also, be warned, &quot;The Quickening&quot; is written at about a third grade reading level, no matter Mr. Bell's pretentions to deep thinking. If you think Art Bell is profound, you'd better ask the space aliens to give you a brain transplant. Finally, there is the matter of the book's index. Whoever (Mr. Bell?) put it together referenced individuals by their first names! Therefore, you will find, say, Carl Sagan under &quot;C&quot; for Carl, rather than &quot;S&quot; for Sagan. And so it goes throughout the index. This is hardly literacy at its best. You'd expect better from junior high school students. Admittedly, it's not as big a blunder as the Viet Nam War; still, if you can't get the small things right ...!

Here, we are clearly shown, using Sagan's own writing, how he fudges facts to fit his theories; how he disputes Velikovsky's proposals based not on free intellectual inquiry, but instead on unproven dogmatic notions; how he distorts history to aggrandize himself; and how he is apparently remarkably free of conscience in this effort.  I suspect that if Sagan done the same type of smear campaign against a &quot;beloved&quot; public figure such as Buckminster Fuller (instead of one as controversial as Velikovsky), his own editors would have quashed his actions.  At times, Ginenthal does go a tad overboard in making certain that the reader recognises the irony or falsehood of Sagan's assertions, but that is my only quibble with the book.  This is an extremely important volume for those interested in popular culture or in the history of science, and should be widely read.	1998-02-01

There aren't many fencing reference books out there in the marketplace today, but this is a good one. Lots of interesting facts about the sport of fencing, although the book's focus is dominated by a British and European bias to the exclusion of much of the rest of the planet (to be expected, perhaps, since the author, E. D. Morton, is British). Still, there is much to learn from MARTINI A-Z OF FENCING. As a writer and fencing master, I recommed it	1997-09-04

This book is of the dry, technical school of fencing books. Making fencing seem like some sort of mechanical, robot activity, it demonstrates none of the excitement or color of the game. I like a fencing book to have some of the writer's personality and love of fencing captured within the text. You'll find none of that here. It's as sterile as an operating room. Also, the photos included display the usual bad form to be found on the modern fencing strip. Nothing classical, where true control comes from. In the end, there is nothing in this book that makes it any better or different than a hundred other fencing books	1997-09-03

Written in 1884, this book is full of the history and lore of the sword. Richard Burton (not the actor)was a historian, an explorer, and a fencer, and he managed to blend all three interests in this fascinating biography of &quot;the Queen of Weapons.&quot; His passion for the sword is obvious as he follows it from its origins in prehistory to Roman times. For Burton, no praise is too great, no detail too small when it comes to the sword. He had a burning desire to illuminate, to tell what he knew, and this he did with the full force of a tidal wave.      Originally planned as the first of three volumes, THE BOOK OF THE SWORD unfortunately sold poorly when it was first published, so the later volumes never materialized. Today, the book is recognized for the work of art it truly is. As a fencing master and writer, I recommend this book highly.	1997-08-16

Aldo Nadi was a great fencer, an acknowledged giant among giants, a champion for whom winning became so commonplace his peers gave up challenging him in disgust. He was also a man for whom success was eternally colored by a fencing rivalry with his older brother Nedo, under whose broad shadow he often labored. Nedo was the beloved of fencing; Aldo, always the bad boy. And, for all his victories on the fencing strip, Aldo never managed to resolve his mixed feelings toward his sibling. While his vast competitive energies helped him overcome every major fencing star in pre-World War II Europe, they never quelled the image of Nedo as the main luminary of the Nadi family. It is obvious that his desire to prove himself superior to his brother played an important role in his success, yet this in no way diminishes the value of his achievements. After all, he had the talent as well as the desire to be a champion. In some respects, Nadi resembles Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac, a character possessed of continually conflicting emotions and motivations. At times brash and opinionated enough to put  off even the stoutest supporter, Aldo nevertheless possessed what it took to back up his words with impressive deeds. He never backed down to anyone, and he lived by a code that demanded he never give anything but his best effort. For that he should be admired. During his sixty odd years, Aldo Nadi was an amateur fencing champion, an Olympian, a duellist, a professional fencer, a fencing master, a movie coach, an actor, and, by his own graphic confessions, a lover of many women. THE LIVING SWORD, Nadi's autobiography, does justice to his varied existence, illuminating not only the man, but also painting a colorful picture of the unique time in which he lived. His descriptions of the European fencing world of the 1920s and 30s, when fencing matches, both professional and amateur, were as popular with the general public as tennis is today, are particularly interesting. You don't even have to be a fencer to enjoy his narrative -- but it doesn't hurt. As a fencing master of some years, I can truly say that Aldo Nadi was someone I would have enjoyed knowing, not only for his expertise in fencing, but also simply for himself. Lacking that experience, reading his book is the next best thing	1997-03-21

Dombey and Son focuses on the life of Florence, the unwanted daughter of Mr. Paul Dombey. She earned the dislike of her Father by being born a girl, rather than being the son and heir that he wished for.  When a son finally is born, Mr. Dombey cannot gain his love --  while Florence, in her simple innocence, can -- which lends more  to Mr. Dombey's dislike of her.        Mr. Dombey's wife dies, as does his son, leaving him and   Florence alone together. Rather than seeking friendship with his  daughter at this point, Mr. Dombey withdraws from her, leaving   Florence to grow up alone, and vainly dream of a day when her  father might learn to love her.        After a long while of this avoidance, Mr. Dombey marries  a cold, hard woman named Harriet; who never loved him and felt that  he purchased her with his money. At this point, Dombey almost  relents toward his daughter -- until he notices a growing friendship  between her and Harriet. Once again Florence has innocently gained  the love of one who Dombey cannot, causing him to not only  harden toward her, but to his cold wife.        Florence's dreams of having her father learn to love her   are abruptly shattered as her father's arrogance and her step-mother's  hatred drive the Dombey household toward a bitter and infamous end.        Dombey and Son is one of Dickens's finest novels; it is complex,   riveting and passionate.	1996-11-23
