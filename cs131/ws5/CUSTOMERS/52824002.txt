Although conventionaly focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has a physical, cognitive, behavioural, social and philosophical dimensions.\\"  Wikipedia<br /><br />Joan Didion starts her book:<br /> \\"Life changes fast<br />  Life changes in an instant<br />  You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends.\\"<br /><br />On December 30, 2003 Joan and her husband, John Gregory Dunne were just sitting down to dinner about 9pm. They had returned from visiting their daughter, Quintana, who was comatose in an ICU in New York City. They were having a conversation as Joan put dinner on the table. She looked up, it was very quiet, John was not responding. He was slumped over the table with his hand raised. She realized all was not well, and in that instant her life changed. An ambulance was called; the trip to the Emergency Department, the meeting with the doctor, massive heart attack mentioned, and she knew her husband was dead. She returned home alone, did a few chores and went to bed and slept soundly. She awakened and realized something was wrong, and her first taste of grief descended.<br /><br />Joan Didion has written a devastating story of her first year after the death of her husband, and the grief that enveloped her. She writes as she thought, and the story is laid out in detail as it happened and in her own words. She has friends and family but John isn't there. She talked to him every day for the forty years they were married. They talked constantly and were with each other all the time. Even though conventional wisdom has it that absence makes the heart grow fonder.  She remembers thinking \\"there is no one to hear the news, no where to go with the unmade plan, the uncompleted thought. There is no one to agree, disagree, talk back\\". Life changes in an instant. There is no place on earth to go where there is no memory. She kept expecting him to come back. She couldn't get rid of his shoes, because he needed shoes to come back. She knew this thought was irrational, but it kept her going.<br /><br />She kept busy helping her daughter and son-in-law put their life back together, and then it comes apart when Quintana becomes ill again. There is much to do, much to read about Quintana's illness, much to discuss with the hospital staff that look at her strangely when she discusses edema and too much \\"fluid overload\\". She immerses herself in the language of medicine, and it keeps her busy for a while. She tried new projects, nothing really works except time, but she still keeps expecting John to come home. He never does. She remembers all the little things he said about his life. He told her they had to go to Paris that November because he might never have the chance again. He was right. He was frequently right. And, oh, she misses him, she always will.  Magnificent story of the year in the life of grief. Highly recommended. prisrobught was irrational, but it kept her going.

He has written a novel that requires much thought and introspection.<br /><br />Wils Raven is on the cusp of adulthood. He remembers in first person that time, and he is speaking from a 60 year old memory. This is one of the first times Ward Just has written a novel in first person, but as he tells it, \\"it just came out that way, and it seemed the thing to do.\\" Ward Just started his career as a journalist and soon graduated to the Washington Post, where he reported from Vietnam. He left journalism in 1969 and started his first novel. Since that time he has written 14 novels. This is the novel that was a Pulitzer Prize Finalist.<br /><br />Wils Raven is a child of privilege. His father owns a newsprint business; they go to the Country Club for golf, dinner and conversation. Wils is an only child. He is studious and not much of an athlete. His father was a renowned athlete, especially in hockey. He would come every evening in the winter, to the luxurious superb of Quarterday, outside of Chicago. He would chide Wils about his lack of athleticism. Wils has the summer to get to know himself better, and he decides he wants to work for a newspaper. H father, of course, has connections and helps Wils obtain his summer job. In-between his day job, he goes to many debutante balls, and it is at one of these that he meets his first love, Aurora.  Aurora is fascinating, but so is her father, a well known psychiatrist who marched in the Baatan March and has never really been able to work through that. It appears that Wils is one of the few people that he has told about his time in the Army and that leave a mark in Wil's soul.  Dr Jason Brule's death from his own hand changes the life that Wils has set for himself, He is in-between the cold war his parents have set for themselves, his life at the newspaper, the debutante balls and the pull he feels for the \\"regular\\" people he meets everyday at his job on the paper. How is he to work out the dramas of this summer? What will the relationship of all of these new people bring to change his life?  We don't know. We can only see from the outside that a change is a'comin'.  This is a well related story of a father, his son and the world that he enters in the Eisenhower years of the 1950's.  Wils is a wounded spirit coming to terms.<br /><br />Ward Just is a fascinating man. He has written 14 books, but is not as well known as he should be. He considers himself \\"undersold\\". \\"An Unfinished Season\\" is one of he best,<br />and he tells us \\"It goes without saying that most people think this book is deeply autobiographical, which it is not.

They like areas with bushes, shrubs and trees, and nearby open ground and short grass.<br />  Wikipedia<br /><br />Professor Wilson Bledsoe, award winning Dartmouth, Nobel prize etiologist, doesn't make it home one night. He goes missing.  The last word heard from him was while he was driving on River Road, near his home in Norwich, Vermont. This road is very familiar to me; I used to live in Norwich.  Prof. Wilson is fiction, but the time and place are real. Dr Ian Smith, the author went to Dartmouth Medical School and knows the area well. His book is full of suspense and mystery, very well written and every detail is covered<br /><br />Sterling Bledsoe receives a phone call in the very early morning. He is in New York City and the phone call is from the Chief of Police in Norwich, Vt to tell him his brother is missing. Sterling calls his boss, the Chief of the FBI and gives his blessing. Sterling is off, not only to the home of his brother, but he is off to solve this mystery. A convoluted,road no doubt. He comes to know almost everyone in Hanover, NH; the President of Dartmouth, the janitors who clean his brothers office, the State and local police, the townspeople and the students, and, of course, Wilson's wife, Kay. Not much is said of Kay. She is broken hearted and bereft. Wilson's body was brutalized, probably to hide the real killers, but his death was brutal.  Sterling goes from Hanover to New York City and to the small town's in-between. The mystery deepens, who and why was Wilson murdered? The clues start to appear, \\"The Blackbird Papers\\"- the tattoes found on Wilson's body.  Someone went to elaborate detail to hide the reasons for this death. Many people are ready to give clues, but who will believe them? The `White Liberation Army' signia is found on Wilson's body. Is this a false clue?  If so, this ruse is so well done that such a plan to mask the real reason for the murder,must have very clever minds at work. Not much is overlooked by Sterling. He had a love/hate relationship with his brother. His brother was the loved one, the one that claimed his parent's heart. Now, it is Sterling's turn to give back, to make right the jealousy he has had all of these years<br /><br />This story is so well written, the mystery becomes so deep that sometimes the plot is hard to keep up with. However, this is one of the few mysteries that I have not guessed the ending by the first chapter. This is an intricately weaved mystery, and it is not until the last chapter that the secret is revealed.

Many Marines reminded me of gladiators. They had that mysterious quality that allows some men to strap on greaves and a breastplate and wade into the gore. I respected, admired and emulated them, but I could never be like them. I could kill when killing was called for, and I got hooked on the rush of combat as much as any man did. But I couldn't make the conscious choice to put myself in that position again and again throughout my professional life. Great Marine commanders, like all great warriors, are able to kill that which they love most-their men. It's a fundamental law of warfare. Twice I had cheated it. I couldn't tempt fate again.\\" Words of wisdom from Nathaniel Fick. This is a book that gives us the realities of military and Marine life in particular, and written with a superb command of the language and the military mind.<br /><br />Nathaniel Fick was a Dartmouth student who wanted to be a physician. He had difficulty with one of his science courses, and this changed the shape of his life. He realized he wanted to go on a great adventure, prove himself, and do something for his country. And that something was revealed in a lecture he went to about the Marines. He joined the Marines and went through one of the most difficult courses of his life,he thought at the time; Officers Candidate School. Not understanding that the real tests were to come. He became a Second Lieutenant and he went on to Recon school.  Reconnaissance teams are the elite of the Marine Corps, if elite was a word in their military language. Recon teams go on the most dangerous missions of all- teams calling for emergency extracts and any form of mission that your mind can imagine.<br /><br />\\"The Marines develop leaders who are not only skilled, courageous, and tough, but also humane\\" Lt Fick was one of these. His first orders were that of a platoon leader, and his first assignment was on a ship. He led some very dangerous missions into Afghanistan, and then the most dangerous mission of all; The Iraq war. \\"War for freedom, war for oil, Philosophical disputes were a luxury I could not enjoy. War was what I had. We don't vote for it, authorize it, or declare it; We just had to fight it.\\" said Lt Fick. And fight it, he did with his platoon. He brought his men through some of the most dangerous of missios. The fact that all of the men he brought with him to Iraq, came home with him in one piece was Lt Fick's own particular mission. He and his men played a small part in the quick \\"win\\" in Baghdad. His experience, intelligence and superb actions as an officer won Lt Fick his promotion to Captain. However, this was enough of war.  Nathaniel Fick knew he could not continue. He left the Marines and spent a year drifting. He realized that combat had nearly unhinged him. He channeled all his energies into applying to graduate school.<br /><br />Nathaniel Fick is now in graduate school at Harvard University and the Kennedy School of Government. He has written this book about his life as a Marine, and he has written several articles discussing the military life and the Iraq War. One of his most recent lett&eacute;rs is about the Iraq war and personal responsibility, and it is brilliantly written.

Alden is the new Czech Ministry of Finance, and Becky is trying to become an entrepreneur of cosmetics from East to West.  Theirs is a marriage of love and understanding, but in the middle of this is a feeling of the bizarre. Julie the daughter, is trying to become the best she can be, which morphs into a colorful, pierced, cosmetic laden young woman. She has many boyfriends, and delights in becoming this lady of love.<br /><br />Alden is a mixture of fierceness and loyal Americanism. He often gives his staff boring lectures of the wrongs in their country, and what they must do make it right. Becky, on the other hand is becoming disaffected with her marriage and in particular with Alden.  After a party welcoming relatives to Prague and to the castle they now live in, Becky decides to make a drastic move.<br /><br />Becky leaves Alden and her children, and she begins a journey to Libya to find her true love  William. After many trials and tribulations, she finds William and they live together in an old restored villa. She finds the writings of another young woman who has followed her path, and we begin to wonder if this story will continue as is or will change to match the glories of the past.<br /><br />Alden, meanwhile is berefit , and he cannot continue. He works from the castle and eventually his entire staff move in with him to keep the Ministry going. Alden is beside himself- he has lost his love and he knows not why. Soon, Becky writes to her children to let them know she is well and safe. The letters find their way to Alden who is stupified, what has gone wrong? His sister, Ginger comes to visit and to try and straighten out these problems. What she finds is a mess and attempts to correct much of it. She is not successful, and what we find is that Becky has made her new life; and Alden is living in the past. Not a good way to end their marriage, nor a great way to end this book.

Yes, she certainly has had a difficult childhood and life, and I hope she is able to claim a life free of drugs and alcohol for her son.<br /><br />She tells us in graphic terms the loves and life she has led in the sex/porn business. She gives us names and dates and circumstances. This must be a relief for those she has named. She has kept secret the names of those she feels treated her well. That must be for the best.<br /><br />I feel very sorry for this woman's life and it took great courage to tell it all. Writing her life story in this manner has left me with an uneasy feeling. It is not the life she has led, but what has she learned from this experience?  Her life has been ugly, and her downward spiral with drugs and alcohol is the usual route for porn stars. This is not a life of glamour and fun, and this, Miss Steffans makes perfectly clear. She has been able to relate her story with clarity and precision. She is to be commended if she is able to change her life. Anyone reading this story would not for a minute dream of becoming a Hollywood Porn star. That is a blessing. prisrob	2005-08-18

His books \\"The Vanishing\\" and \\"The Cave\\" have become known world wide, and made into very successful movies. He started out in life knowing he had to be a winner. His first love was that of chess. He played chess, he wrote books on chess, he joined tournaments, and then he realized he would never be the winner he wanted to be. So, at the age of 29, he turned to bicycle racing.<br /><br />Through out his life, Tim Krabbe,also realized he had to write. No matter what he was involved in, he had to write. In this book \\"De renner\\" or \\"The Rider', he has made literary history. The book was written in 1978 and has become a cult classic. This is a fascinating book, a half-day race, 150km, of the love of bicycle racing, and the love of relating the life of racing.<br /><br />\\"It's a ride to the sun, and a ride to Zen-the definitive abc of sports, an encyclopedia, a literary masterpiece, an adventure novel and bicycling odyssey all rolled into one,\\" one book critic wrote. Tim Krabbe tells of us his life as a cyclist all rolled up into a small book of 129 pages. The prose that rolls out of his mouth onto the paper of the book is memorable. This is a book that begs to be read again and again. He tells us of a fantasy of riding with bicycle's best and besting them all by winning the race. Throughout this half day race, we learn how to put the bicycle together and take it apart.  We learn all about gears, and what to use, when. We learn what he eats before he starts the race, where to put his hands on the handle bars and how to choose the bicycle seat. The men he races with, the fans that turn out and scream encouragement for all of their favorites. The cafes, the bars,and the major developments of racing. And through out this race, instead of chapters the book is divided into kilometers of the race. We end at Kilometer 137, when he crosses the finish line. Was he the first, third, or tenth?  Gotcha' you need to read this book, and you will love it.<br /><br />This is not a book that is a metaphor for life. It is a book of the racing life and how this life takes over. I understand for the first time, how a racer's blood becomes attuned to the race, the speed, the climbs, the straights, the finish line, the Win!<br /><br />\\"Whenever I hit absolute rock bottom I always think of those immortal words from De renner by Tim Krabb&eacute;-Batoowoo Creakcreak-and everything seems just fine again.\\"<br />Maarten Ducrot, bicycle racer<br /><br />Highly recommended.

Racers thus spend a lot of time studying each other for what card players refer to as \\"tells\\": the imminent signs of cracking, the moment of supreme vulnerability when one good push can decide a race. Some tells are so obvious as to be considered amateurish\\"<br /><br />The tells that were discussed in this book that I thought were the most fun were the tells that occurred on the first day of the European race, the Tour of Murcia. The belly pinch is one. Under the guise of a handshake, a rival or coach will grasp the target's hand, and tug them forward twisting their bodies lightly for access to their belly, to test for fat. The ass check is more of an art. You look from a distance. Riders in top form have asses that become small and vaguely feminine. After a while you have your rival memorized, what is big for them, small and somewhere in the middle.<br /><br />These facts, these are the ones that make this book so valuable and so readable. I have been reading this book during the 2005 Le Tour.  I now know the real Lance, his rivals and teammates, his loves, his mother, his step-fathers, his children, his friends, his likes and dislikes and so much information about the Le Tour 2004. This book has given credence to my love of Lance Armstrong as a Cancer Survivor, cyclist and all American hero.<br /><br />Daniel Coyle, the author, has been able to find the right touch; to discuss what Lance Armstrong is all about. And, he has also allowed us into the inner world of the racing cyclist. Just what happens on tour? How do the cyclists prepare? What does it take to be a world class cyclist, and the best cyclist in the world? He has been given access into the inner workings of Le Tour teams. He has provided us with data and statistics of what cyclists endure. Is a cyclist like Lance Armstrong born with the talent or does he have to train his entire life. How does someone overcome this mystique, and how does one answer the questions of doping?<br /><br />We learn of the lives of Le Tours major players; Jan Ullrich, Tyler Hamilton, Alexandre Vinokourov, Iban Mayo, John Landis and Basso.  Why is Lance Armstrong called the greatest athlete of our time? How does Sheryl Crowe measure up with Le Tour group? Linda Armstrong, what is her role, and how has she helped to shape this man we love?<br /><br />What about the injuries, how does one protect themselves against harm?  And, Le Tour, what are the stages, how does a Peleton work, what about the Pyrenees and the Alps? What does Le Tour mean in Europe, and why are not more Americans as enthralled as we are with our hero, Lance Armstrong, and our love of the cycling sport?<br /><br />\\"The average pro cyclist will pedal far enough in training each year to encircle the globe. The daily metabolic rate of a Tour de France cyclist exceeds that of Everest climbers and comes close to matching the highest rates found in any other animal species.\\"  Does this impress you as it does me? Then this book is for you. I have found this book the most informative and most fun read of any Le Tour book or any Lance Armstrong book.<br /><br />So highly recommended, I have given books to friends and family. prisrob.

His mom and dad were divorced when he was young and it was not an easy time.  He saw his dad every other weekend but he seemed removed and withdrawn, and Dan never felt he really knew his dad. Dan had a usual childhood, and his adolescence was full of drugs and alcohol. As a young adult Dan outgrew his wild ways and settled down to become a nature writer. This brought him to the point where he realized his dad was getting older and he wanted a better relationship.  And, Dan had a pretty good idea of how to achieve this.<br /><br />Richard Koeppel had grown up wanting to be an ornithologist. He had a particular love of birds and wanted to study them. However, his parents and his father in particular had a different vision of his son. So, Richard began his life studying to become a physician. He continued with his life long love of birds and went birding whenever he could. Eventually, Richard met the love of his life and married her. She was a hometown girl and was beautiful and was swept away by this man.  Richard continued his studies and graduated as a physician. He now had responsibilities because his first born son was born. He didn't like the life of a physician, and he had various jobs that at leas paid him a decent salary.  By this time there were two young boys and his marriage was going sour. He and his wife divorced and he never married again. He saw his boys on weekends.<br /><br />Dan saw both sides of the marriage and was unsettled.  He lived with his mother, and her boyfriends were sometimes nasty and abusive. She would also take out her frustrations on her sons. Life was not good.  He would go birding with his father and this became fun for him. But he didn't get to see his dad often enough.<br /><br />By the time Dan was ready to get to know his father better, Richard was on his way to identifying his 6,000  bird.  The birding world is a different species. There were many people who love birds and there were 9,600 birds to identify in the entire world. People spent millions of dollars traveling to various parts of the world just to find that bird. This is when Dan started going on birding trips with his dad. His dad was now an ED physician which gave him plenty of time to pursue his love. He had been all over the world and was so pleased that Dan wanted to continue with him.  He had a few more birds to identify and he wanted to make it to 7,000 birds. Thus began the quest for Dan and his father, Richard, to find the birds.<br /><br />I love birds, love their coloring , their calls and their existence. However I have never been that much interested in identifying birds. This book opened up the world of birding, and these are crazy people in a sense. They will do anything; go anywhere to find that bird. I loved that Dan got to know his father better while they both developed their relationship birding. I learned a great deal about birds and that kind of life. Dan Koeppel writes well and his sense of nature reveals the world around us. Highly recommended. prisrobd there were 9,600 birds to identify in the entire world. People spent millions of dollars traveling to various parts of the world just to find that bird.

She now tells us of her romantic life. A memoir that promised to tell us all. Well, it tells of a woman who enjoyed her life, and even though she was a school drop-out she is a brilliant writer. She knows how to turn a phrase, as they say, and to bring her life to the fore.  Until now, she has been able to keep her love life a secret. And, many a gossip columnist has tried to guess just who her paramours were.<br /><br />This is a small book full of tales of love. Several kinds of love, and I will leave it up to you to find out what I am talking about.  From Miss Porter's school to the present day, Gloria Vanderbilt tells of her loves and life.  Not all names are mentioned, and I could catch myself trying to guess just who that married photographer was that captured her attention for so many years.  She has no qualms about discussing her romances with<br /><br />married men. All in all, Gloria realizes she was looking for her missing father during her early years of romance.  And, later on for friendship, sex, lust and romance. She found them all and packed them all into her life and memoir.<br /><br />I bought this book because Gloria Vanderbilt's son, Anderson Cooper, recommended it. A nice little read, he said. Yes, a nice read, but not too much more.  There are too many details left out and not much to keep my interest. It can be read in a few hours, and is more like a diary that Gloria Vanderbilt kept.  But not enough gutsy, from the heart,<br /><br />truth filled lines that would make this a great book. Recommended. prisrob	2005-06-24

What a beautiful second birthday gift for my lucky little girl. Most of us are familiar with John Updike. He is a contemporary, well known author from New England, Massachusetts to be exact. John Updike has written the poetry of each month. The poetry reaches into and grabs us all but particularly the child-the rhymes and rhythm so graceful.  Trina Schart Hyman has drawn the illustrations. Trina Schart Hyman was from New Hampshire, right up the road from me. She was one of the most glorious illustrators and painters.  It was not until Trina's daughter married a man of color that Trina realized her illustrations were all of white people. She has rectified that and these illustrations are magnificent.<br /><br />This is May in New England- John Updike has written:<br /><br />  \\"New children may<br /><br />  go out of doors<br /><br />  Without their coats<br /><br />  to candy stores<br /><br />  The apple blossoms<br /><br />  and the pear<br /><br />  may float their blossoms<br /><br />  through the air.\\"<br /><br />Trina Schart Hyman has drawn a Vermont General Store with a sign that says Vermont Cheeses; Maple Products, Homestead Bacon- children are shopping in the store as we can see through the open doorway, a young boy is licking his ice cream on the steps as his dog watches hoping for a falling icy piece.<br /><br />The rest of the book is similar- from January through December, a poem for each month and a beautiful vivid illustration to match. What child would not love this book- I love this book! Each month shows the change of season in New England- you can almost feel the leaves crinkle and the soft snow on your eyelids.<br /><br />This children's book has won a Caldecott Honor. The front cover shows two children at the top of a big hill facing a little village. It is winter and they have a sled and and look like they are ready to go down... nnn the hill.

I was a 9 year old avid reader, when I was given my first Cherry Ames book. She did it all, student nurse, senior nurse, cruise ship nurse, public health nurse and on and on. She was the epitome of a glamorous woman who could do no wrong.<br /><br />Cherry Ames, had a twin brother, Charles, He was as fair as she was dark, but he was tall as she was. They were both very intelligent and lived in Hilton. They had wonderfully kind and intelligent parents who loved them. We all had loving parents, but they could never measure up to the Ames.<br /><br />Cherry graduated from high school, and as she always knew she would, she went to Spencer School of Nursing. She met her new classmates and fell into the study routines. She wore her blue and white striped uniform proudly. She met the doctors. They were never to be argued with and always addressed with respect. The professors of nursing were tough and rigid, but Cherry Ames understood they had to be that way. After all these student nurses had life and death situations in their hands. It wasn't all study- there was fun. Cherry stole Annie Chase, the doll they used to practice injections and bed baths on. They had dances where they met all the young physicians on staff. They had parties, and this was a big city so they could go out once in a while if permission was given. They could go out to a movie or have dinner at a restaurant.<br /><br />Cherry Ames was a model nurse; her patients received the best of care during her 12 hour shifts. They were so appreciative of their brave nurse who stood up for them against the stodgy old doctors.  She smoothed the way for all of them- she loved them so. And, all of her sister student nurses loved her too. She was perfection and the best. She moved through her first year so effortlessly. There were no weekends or holidays at home. They were all spent taking care of patients. Patients came first. What a role model! Did I find life as a student nurse much different than Cherry Ames portrayed? Yes, Yes, Yes!  Tough science and math courses. Anatomy and physiology and chemistry and physics and then dissecting a cat and going to see my first autopsy. My first patient who had a broken femur and the first time he stood up, he had a massive pulmonary embolus and went into cardiac arrest.  Yes, an exciting time for us all.

Jim Dwyer and Kevin Flynn have written an astounding account of these minutes. Built second by minute from personal, email, telephone and reported accounts, as they happened, in the time. Heroic proportions of a day that will forever remain in our memory.<br /><br />New York Times reporters, Jim Dwyer and Kevin Flynn have reported the epic story of the time starting from 8:46 through the next 102 minutes until the last tower came tumbling down and the last person was found alive in the rubble that was left behind.<br /><br />The stories of the 2,749 people who died in the twin towers are told from a personal perspective. The heroics of all - the English company who ordered all of their people to leave the building immediately to the stockbrokers who were told to stay at their desk. The untold energy of the numbers of people who helped each other down the stairs, out of elevators, injured, maimed and short of breath into the rubble of the earth below them. The Windows of the World restaurant, where business meetings were part of the daily routine- the restaurant workers, waiters and others who were having their last cup of coffee, never dreaming it would be their last cup of coffee, ever.  The rescue of some people is so moving and the death of all of the others is so extreme and so hard to understand. Why were some saved and others lost?<br /><br />The unbiased truth that has come out of this book is that the lack of sufficient and reliable communication, and the competitive nature of the NYPD and the Fire fighters may be one of the reasons why so many died.  Since the first attack of the Twin Towers in 1993,no plan for another terrorist attack had really been planned. A lot of talk and a lot of money had been spent trying to devise a plan. But the NYPD and Fire Fighters were never able to sort out their differences. The then Mayor Giuliani raved on and on about the heroics of the NYPD and firemen who were killed trying to save the lives of those in the towers. However, facts have shown that these brave men never got the message to evacuate and were probably fighting their way further up the towers to their death.<br /><br />The lessons learned from this tragedy are many. The ones we need to remember are that truth finally tells. Improving communication and building relationships among the two departments should be the first steps. 3 ½ years after 9/11 has anything changed?<br /><br />This is a book for all of us. One of the last heroes is the lapsed paramedic who rose from his bed to find his way to the towers to try and do something. He and two marines were able to extricate two policemen who were buried in the rubble up to their necks. These are the memories.

How prophetic that Peter Robinson starts his fifteenth novel, \\"Strange Affair: A Novel of Suspense\\" with a quote about friend and family. Detective Chief Inspector, Alan Banks has received a phone message from his brother Roy requesting \\"Help, It may be a matter of life and death.\\"  I found this novel in Amazon's top 100 list, and since I love great English mysteries I picked it up. What a find. Oh, I love this new series.<br /><br />DCI, Alan Banks, is a man who is driven to find the truth, and a man who does not feel the need to follow rules of law and order.<br /><br />His brother has called and has now gone missing.  A young woman who is found shot to death in her car,  Jennifer Clews, has Alan's name and address on a piece of paper on her body. What is this all about?  Detective Annie Cabbot is about to find out. Coincidence that Alan and Annie are ex-lovers and have left their relationship in tatters? It makes this all the more interesting. Past history is hinted at, and some of it updated so if you have not read the previous fourteen novels you are still in the picture.<br /><br />DCI Alan Banks starts the investigation of finding his brother, and interviewing all of those who may know something about the sometimes shady work Roy was known to pursue. Alan is recuperating from a fire in his home that was started by a lover of DI Annie Cabbot. In the meantime Annie is investigating Jennifer Clewes murder, and the connection between Jenn and Alan's brother Roy.  In the background is another investigation of several young women who were attacked at night on lonely roads in Yorkshire.  The investigations take us into London and back to Yorkshire, and the colors, tastes and sounds of the UK are brought to life by Peter Robinson's imaginative writing. It has been said that Peter Robinson is incapable of writing a dull sentence! The trio of investigations all come together,and the findings of conspiracy, corruption, murders and mobsters bring these mysteries to a singular fantastic conclusion.<br /><br />At first I was leery of another DCI who was a tough guy that loved his whiskey. But DCI Alan Banks is a man of his own. The complex characters that surround Alan Banks all have their own peccadilloes and are brought to life in this suspenseful and evocative mystery.  I have found a new friend in DCI Alan Banks and plan to read every one of the other fourteen novels. A great new mystery-suspense and this may be of the best new British novels. A true find. Smooth as whiskey. Heartily recommended. prisrobings of conspiracy, corruption, murders and mobsters bring these mysteries to a singular fantastic conclusion. <br /> <br />At first I was leery of another DCI who was a tough guy that loved his whiskey.

He has written a novel that sings of the Irish tradition, the Irish Culture and the Irish addiction. How he has come to know all of this is a little bit of a mystery, and in the telling of this story we gain a little bit of knowledge of what is in his head.<br /><br />Alex, Alexander Lawson, is a junkie, a heroin addict and an ex-detective for the Northern Ireland police force. At a young age he joined the force and was promoted rapidly in to the detective division, until he was asked to resign for stealing the junk he was hired to protect.  What is behind this\\"? Why would such an intelligent young man allow this to happen?  Slowly, ever so slowly we come to learn a few of the reasons. Alex is wanted by the MI5- something is fishy in the drug world of Belfast, and the MI5 wants to know more and Alex is their boy. The MI5 frightens Alex; he can't be imprisoned and he needs to flee. Alex finds a ticket to the US in the guise of discovering just how his first girlfriend, Victoria Patawasti was murdered. The murder took place in Denver, Colorado and Alex and his friend, John are off to solve this murder.<br /><br />One thing after another happens, and Alex becomes involved in an environmental group that Victoria had worked for.  There are several interesting people in this group and among them is Amber, the beautiful, blonde wife of one of the owners. But, also, something isn't right in this group, and Alex finds out exactly what the problem is. Within this mess he leaves several dead bodies behind, but makes a friend of Pat, an ex-firefighter who has HIV. Quite a collection of friends has this Alex- some kind, but most of them are dark and well, murderous.  Alex is led throughout Colorado and starts to gather evidence that will convict one of the owners of the murder of his friend Victoria. But then something interesting happens, and the killer turns into someone we would never expect. Except we knew this was too black and white- we suspected something was not ok. The drug mess he left in Ireland is explained in several flashbacks and that is how we come to understand. And, yes, well, never mind, read this fast paced, brilliant book for yourself.<br /><br />Adrian McKinty has found a fan. He writes an intelligent mystery full of little bits of this and that, brilliantly executed and then just when you have it all figured out, BAM- you are wrong.

It takes place in small community outside of London. However, this group of women needed a place and reason to meet, drink wine and talk. What better idea than to talk about a book they have all read? That's how it started, and it all evolved into a look into each of their lives.  Everyone thinks the grass looks greener on the other side, well, no, it isn't, we learn.<br /><br />Five women, four of them friends and one pushed into the book group by her mother:<br /><br />Harriet, co-founder of the group- thirty something with a husband who adores her and two children who adore her.<br /><br />Nicole- friend of Harriet and co-founder of the group.

Married to a physician and mother to two grown boys.<br /><br />Clare- the women who was pushed into this group by her mother. She is a midwife, unable to have children of her own and she and her husband are at a crossroads.<br /><br />Into this book group, come 12 books, one for each month. Books, they talk about, love or hate and then they relate to the book in some fashion. And, then they discuss their individual lives. Many problems abound, as you can imagine. The book is slow to get into, but after awhile you enjoy hearing about how their lives are progressing or not as the case may be.  The stories are funny, sad and honestly stated. But, some are overstate and surreal. How could this happen to this smart woman, well, you know, you love a man and then you don't always see what is under your nose.<br /><br />I found myself rooting for several of these women and feeling sorry for some. True life, maybe not, but a fun read. Recommended. prisrob	2005-02-08

Rebus's original police station has closed, and he is trying to find a place for himself. His reputation precedes him; he is known as a troublemaker or trouble finder and not an easy person to deal with. He is also known as someone who is trustworthy and honest (well, to a degree). He must push himself into this investigation, and as always Rebus finds the truth and a little more. Rebus is a kinder, gentler man in this novel. He attempts to develop a relationship with an artist who is fighting to have an immigrant detention center closed. However, Rebus is the enemy so to speak, so this relationship is not an easy one. Rebus is also watching his drink, not really drinking less but watching it; so he has developed a real social conscience- he doesn't drive while drinking.<br /><br />In the meantime Siobhan Clarke, Detective Sergeant, a close friend of Rebus's has developed her own mystery. She is asked by parents to look for their daughter, Ishbel Jardine. Siobhan had been involved in an attempt to solve the crime of their older daughter's rape and subsequent suicide. Now this younger daughter has gone missing, and the parents are worried. She is drawn into the search and then to find the murderer of this first daughter's rapist.<br /><br />Both of these mysteries have close ties, and Rebus and Siobhan work together. Is the murder of the immigrant a racist plot? The twists and turns lead to a mass immigrant con game with big money at the core. The disappearance of the young girl leads to consequences not expected.<br /><br />The relationship between John Rebus and Siohban Clarke has been innocent but friendly and now something more is hinted. These two understand each other and have a close working relationship, but could something closer work for the two of them? I enjoyed this book as much or more than the others. However that said, the history of Rebus and Siohban gives us insight into how their personalities have developed and changed.

The glitz, the glamour, the women and men, and the sex are what they think porn is all about. The tawdry, abusive, dirty and sad side of life is the real world of porn.<br /><br />Jenna Jameson aka Jenna Massoli was born in Las Vegas. Her mother was a Vegas showgirl and died a very painful death from cancer when Jenna was a small child. Her father never really recovered from his wife's death. He became a policeman and essentially left Jenna and her brother Jack to grow up by themselves. He was absent from much of their lives. They moved frequently and Jenna had a hectic life. Never really making friends and never having a loving relationship. In one small town in Montana she was gang raped and left for dead.  Jenna reacted violently and injured a girl who had been abusive to her.  The family left town - the same way they reacted with all problems; fleeing and never facing the problem head-on. Jenna drifted into one bad relationship after another and learned to make money with her body.  At first she danced in a strip club and moved on to stripping and then on to porn stills and then porn movies.<br /><br />Much of this book is about Jenna and her life in the porn business. She is quite open about the drugs and alcohol and life she led. In order to maintain a semblance of life she had affairs with men and women she worked with. She tells us of her life and that of other female and male porn stars. At times she tries to glamorize the business by talking of the money, the clothes, the make-up, the travel, and all the people she met. But most of the book is about her search for love, and of course, for love in all the wrong places with all the wrong people.  She believes that celebrities will welcome her into their lives and business. She tells of her affairs with well known Hollywood stars and rock band members.  But beneath all of this is the raw, gritty life of the porn star that survives on booze and drugs and never makes it to the top. This is a sad story of a life of a young woman who did not have a family to support her. She only knew that she had to fight and kick her way into life and that is what she is still doing.  Jenna has some good insight into her life and the men she loved, but she is unable to leave the business. She is still making movies and at times dreaming of having children. She is proud that she has been able to rise above her stripper life and make her way in the world. She married a kindred soul, and they are in business together. It seems this is enough for Jenna Jameson.<br /><br />This is a very honest portrayal of life in the porn business. Jenna Jameson does not pull any punches.  She does not make excuses for her life, nor does she try to leave the business. This is her life she believes, and she will make the best of it. She is a success she believes because she has learned from her inner strength, and not waiting for fulfillment from someone else.  A good read but not for the squeamish. prisroball of this is the raw, gritty life of the porn star that survives on booze and drugs and never makes it to the top.

It is a little book 7\\" by 5\\", 139 pages and full of wisdom, wit and weirdness. A friend suggested this book when I talked about planning for retirement. You don't just retire, you know, you have to plan to retire. And that, my friend, is the jest of this book. You don't just quit, you have to plan to quit.<br /><br />\\"Quitting does not come out of the clear, blue sky. Every quitter enters into his quit armed with something to quit, a number of methods at his disposal, and a natural predilection for how to proceed\\" so says, Evan Harris the author. She has written a book filled with all of the information you need (and some you don't need, but fun to read). There is work ahead- you must keep track of many items, if quitting is to be successful.  Type of quit, technique, and style of the quitter are all part of the equation that must go into the quit.<br /><br />There are 6 types of quits. You need to focus on what it is you don't want. Get it right!<br /><br />1.Job quitting-paid or unpaid<br />2.Person quitting<br />3.Thing quitting<br />4.Location quitting<br />5.Idea quitting<br />6.Habit quitting<br /><br />There are 20 techniques in quitting and Evan Harris writes a chapter on each type. They  are informative and humorous. At first I thought this book was maybe, well, silly, but then I understood. Much of this book is written tongue in cheek, but it is filled with wisdom if you know how to interpret it. Quitting has a schedule- it starts with euphoria and may enter into post quitting depression. Some helpful hints are to tell everyone you know, that you have quit, they will congratulate you, or think about quitting something else so you can have the euphoria again.<br /><br />Quitting is an art, an act of will and a form of expression, Some people may not understand and some will be jealous. Quit because you can. One of the most popular techniques of quitting that we can all identify with is the Make a Scene Quit. One example would be to wait for your boss to appear and ask you one more time to carry out some mindless task. Scream at your boss, and say, \\"I have had it\\", tear up your most important work and throw it at your boss and stomp out and say \\"I, Quit\\" No more job, for sure. Or use the Abandon and Conceal Quit. No one will know you are doing it- refuse to wear underwear, quit reading the table of contents, or stop believing in germs.<br />The most helpful quit is the Plot and Endure quit- You are planning to retire- you can tolerate most anything because you know there's an end in sight.<br /><br />As W.C. Fields said \\"If at first you don't succeed, try again. Then quit. No use in being a damn fool about it.\\"  This book is for real and can be very useful. It is also full of information to use at your next cocktail party or at the dentist's office when you are kept waiting. We are all going to quit something at some time in our life. Be prepared. Read the encyclopedia of quitting and go on do it. You know, I really have had enough of this, I quit.

Carrie appears oblivious to Mark's attraction.  She is involved with her gardening business, and she finds her life is all involved in her work.<br /><br />At one point, Mark believes that interviewing Carrie's mother would be beneficial in examining the life of Gilbert Strong. He invites Carrie to go along on the journey. During the journey the inevitable happens and they make love.  Mark is ecstatic, but he also loves his wife. What a quandary. His wife, Diane is a brilliant and intuitive woman and knows something is going on. She makes plans to join Carrie and Mark on the return journey.  The journey back to England is an interesting one, and a part of the novel that deserves full attention. Carrie leaves Mark and Diane and goes on her own adventure.

We read the PR, the newspapers, CD jackets, lyrics he wrote and sang, but how little we knew of him. At long last, Bob Dylan satisfies our mind and his by scribing his true self.<br /><br />Bob Dylan is from Hibbing, Minnesota. We all knew that, but not of his life as a child and teenager learning to sing and that of his family. He opens his Chronicle with his arrival in New York City in 1964. He tells us of his journey to NYC, and the people he meets and greets. The people who helped him get started, the people he lives with, loves with and sings with. His trials and tribulations as a young singer in the throes of &#34;folk&#34; songs. He tells us how he came to his writing style, who helped to direct him, and who he admired and trusted. He describes how he came to be able to write such lyrics. He used to go to the library as a child and read classics, and he continued that in NYC in a friend's large library. His vocabulary and intellect grew as a result. He hung around the right and wrong people, he learned as he observed. He got his first chance to sing in small club, and met the person who would help him with his first record deal.<br /><br />Bob Dylan had quite a reputation as a man on the edge, helping to fight the battles for justice and the American Way. That was all wrong, all hype, all PR.<br />He believed in justice and the American Way, but he was not on the fore front fighting for it. He wanted the reverse; to be left alone, to live his life and to write and sing. All the publicity drew strange and unattractive people to him- they broke into his home, found him wherever he was and bothered him and his family. He felt unsafe as Bob Dylan. He hated that life.<br />He learned to rent a house under an assumed name and to become undistinguished. He was able to travel and to be himself, somewhat. He married, had 5 children that he dearly loved. He helped to raise them, changed their diapers, loved them, gave them toys, brought them to the beach, picnics; ordinary. everyday stuff. Bob Dylan would have us believe that he is an ordinary man; well, ok, he is in some way. But he is also a troubadour, singing the words and tunes that we all love. He has been everywhere. He tells of us his time in New Orleans; the city he loves the most. Trying to get a record together and what he learned about himself and the songs he wrote. He tells of us his dinner with Bono, of U2, and how they drank a case of Irish ale, and what they learned from each other.

First he buys a border collie that herds garbage trucks and buses in the city- then he spends the next year training this dog, and finally realizing he needs to move out of the city. So, he packs up his bags, says good-bye to his wife and daughter and off he goes with three dogs and along the way collects two donkeys and sixteen sheep. A sane man- maybe not, but a very smart one. Jon Katz has found the way- or a religion so to speak.<br /><br />Jon Katz is a writer and a lover of dogs. This story centers around one year of his life. A year spent on a farm in upstate New York, a very difficult year, but one he would do again in a New York minute.  He has a small cabin, but realizes he needs more room and with his wife's permission he buys an old farm. He is lucky to have wonderful neighbors who come to his rescue when he needs them the most. Andy is a Vermont carpenter and adds safety and room to Jon's life. He helps to resurrect the barn and other small buildings.  John has decided he must have some sheep for his dogs to herd. Along with the sixteen sheep comes a donkey-and then later on another small donkey at the recommendation of The Donkey lady.  His sheep and one ram, of course, make babies and in the middle of the worst winter in New York State; 17 baby sheep are born. Jon narrates his harrowing times and what he has learned from the winter. He knows and now understands fully that you must have neighbors who understand what you are up against. He never would have made it without them. Most of his neighbors and townspeople love his dogs and love watching the dogs herd sheep. Most of these people are farmers without much money, and they look at Jon as a curious neighbor, but they too grow to respect him. The admiration is mutual and the stories of the townspeople help us to understand what it takes to live in upper New York State in stark winter.  Another reason that Jon may not be entirely sane!<br /><br />Jon Katz dispenses sage wisdom from his work with dogs. The dogs have changed his life and how he thinks about himself. He builds a new relationship with his long lost sister. He is finally able to understand what his miserable childhood has done to him, and how the dogs can help him mend.  He firmly believes that all dogs must be trained to be dogs. Dogs are not people and we need to able to show them how to live in our people world.  Good truth and wisdom from this book. Jon Katz has a way about him that envelops us, and we learn to care about him and his dogs. Tears and laughter abound throughout this book.

In Zoë Heller's novel, \\"Everything You Know\\" we learn a lot about Willy. He could be a distasteful guy, but then, he is a lot like us in many ways.<br /><br />Willy is in Mexico recuperating from a heart attack and trying to write a script of a celebrity's memoirs- somewhere there is writer's block and his agent has got him this place to stay and write it out. His girlfriend, Penny, one of those LA women, plastic surgerized and not too bright is with him. He receives a call from his sister in England that his \\"mutti\\" (mother) has died and off they go to his homeland. Willy left England with a shabby reputation. His wife, OOna died from striking her head on a fridge door during a domestic bout, and Willy was indicted for her murder. He was sent to prison but got out when he won his appeal. He has two daughters, both of whom believed he killed their mom. His youngest daughter took an overdose of pills and killed herself. Months after her death someone sent him her diaries.  They are a compilation of her life- lonely with no mom or dad and no real place to live, looking for love and never really finding it.  Reading these diaries gives Willy a chance to look at his own life and try to make some sense of it.  While in England he visits his second daughter, but finds she is out for what she can get from him- money.  His relatives have given up on him. It is really only Penny who believes in him, and she has no good  reason, He has strung her along for a couple of years. He isn't even sure he likes her.<br /><br />You would think that Willy is a person we wouldn't really like. But we do, he grows on us. He has become someone we care about. We learn more about him than he really wants us to know. He could be any man- warts and all.  Willy has a chance to turn his life around.  His heart attack has not changed his way of living, except he never wants to go back to that \\"dirty, filthy hospital, where no one would give him a bath.\\"  What is to become of Willy? Will Penny stay with him, will he realize how important she is to him?<br /><br />Zoe Heller is one of those new authors that will be around for a while.<br /><br />Highly recommended. prisrobas a chance to turn his life around.

But I also know and have worked with Archer's brother.  The best part of Archer Mayor's books is that he is such a great writer. He keeps us on the edge of our seats, so to speak. We are not certain just what will happen next. And, in \\"The Sniper's Wife\\", we now go to New York City and find new people and places to love.<br /><br />Willy Kunkle, newly promoted to Detective in the Vermont Bureau of Investigation, receives a call none of us want to get. His ex-wife has died and the NYPD Blue is asking him to identify her. He drives to New York City and goes to the morgue first and identifies her, then to her apartment where he goes over everything. He finds not much but a mess the police have left. He finds a few pictures and keepsakes.  He cleans the apartment as his ex-wife would want it. He remembers her and why they split. Willy was a drunk and beat his wife once and she left him, as she should. She became a junkie, but had cleaned up her act. He did not believe that his wife committed suicide as described. He believes that this is murder.<br /><br />Willy goes on to meet the NYPD police and reads his ex-wife's record. He starts his investigation, but not without calling on his boss, Joe Gunther and Willy's new girl, Detective Sammie Martin. Thus his friends can deal with the NYPD as he goes about finding who murdered his wife.<br /><br />This is a wonderful story of love and redemption in a different setting of murder and police work.  Archer Mayor has given new life to Willy Kunkle and set us free from Joe Gunther for a few pages.  This is as exciting a novel as any and so well written. Highly recommended. prisrob	2004-09-17

Oprah Winfrey and Anna Quindlan have either helpful hints or articles.<br /><br />\\"Nesting: It's A Chick Thing\\" by Ame Beanland and Emily Terry is a cute book.  I received it as a gift. It is easy to read, great illustrations, and all of the chapters are well written. However, the book is too simplistic for me.  It will not change my housekeeping, cooking or gardening habits. This book is meant for young women just starting their life as newly weds, or out of college with a new home or apartment.  The idea is terrific and should be marketed to the younger generation.  It is a fun read, and will answer any question you can think of on decorating, cooking or gardening. Great hints on \\"Painting like a Pro\\"; \\"Starting from Scratch\\". with an empty room; \\"Starter Tool Kit\\"; \\" How To Set a Table\\"; \\"How To Host a Poker Party\\" ( that is one chapter that I really learned from); \\"Ultimate Comfort Food Menu\\"; \\"What You Need In The Kitchen\\"; How To Roast Anything\\"; Cottage Gardens\\"; \\"How To Use A Hoe\\"; \\"How Royalty Pulls Weeds\\"; and the best of all,\\" Kindergarten- How to garden with children\\".<br /><br />Ame Beanland is an editor and art director and would rather garden than eat, she says.

I had heard about this book from a friend, and as soon as I saw the title I knew this was it! What a wonderful plane trip- I was on the next to last page as we landed and read the last two pages while waiting for my luggage. Whoopee, what a book, what a read, I hated for it to end. It is one of those kinds of books.<br /><br />\\"Crossing to Safety\\" by Wallace Stenger is the kind of book that you read once in a life time. The characters become so real and so alive. You like these people; you do not want any of life's mysteries and sadness to befall on any them. Well, maybe that couple that was so nasty, no, no, not even them.<br /><br />Larry and Sally Morgan move to Madison, Wisconsin in the 1930's to start their life. Sally is pregnant, and Larry is about to start a teaching job at the university. They have little money and his job is a lifesaver. Larry's dream is to be a writer and he has published one article. At a faculty party they meet Charity and Sid Lang. Sid comes from big money and they have all they need besides two children and one on the way.  Charity and Sally get along famously, and Sid and Larry develop a bond.<br /><br /> This novel follows these two marriages, the ins and outs and the personal issues they each face. We are rarely allowed into a marriage to see all the warts.  Over the next many years we follow both families from Wisconsin to Vermont and Cambridge and Italy. We see the friendships between the couples develop. We learn that Charity must manipulate and control- and that Sid needs the push she gives him.  Larry becomes a well read author with several books and articles. Sally is happy to be a wife and mother until tragedy befalls. Sid is a wonderful teacher but really wants to write poetry. How do these couples help each other discover the truth within them? What does each of these people bring to the group? Why are they destined to love each other for their life? What is so special about these 4 people?  How do they react when the greatest tragedy of all hits one of them?<br /><br />Wallace Stenger allows us to see the real people below the exterior trappings. I came to love these people, to really care about what happened to them. I think what if that had not happened, or what if this had happened? This is the way we think in real life with our memories. Wallace Stenger is a literary genius. Highly recommended.  prisrobstined to love each other for their life? What is so special about these 4 people?

She has such a cute way about her; loves her job, doesn't really care how she looks most of the time, has a personality and looks that attract the men, and is not wonder woman!  Janet Evanovich, author of \\"To the Nines\\" has created characters that have me laughing and chuckling to myself. They are so real that I can see them in my mind. I have an image of Lula, the big size ex-ho, turned bonds-woman; Ranger, the ex-Special Forces turned bond enforcement; grandma, the woman who likes wigs and is as crazy as Stephanie-wonder whom Stephanie takes after; and Morelli, the cop, Stephanie's lover.  Janet Evanovich has such a wonderful imagination- I want to meet that woman.<br /><br />Stephanie is in trouble again. She is working with Ranger to find Samuel Singh, a missing computer nerd who is out on bail. Vinnie, Stephanie's boss will lose money if Mr. Singh is not found. Stephanie does all the right things, she looks in all the right places, asks all the right questions, and of course, she is a marked woman. Trouble seems to find her, she is left flowers with a devious message, shot at with a dart, email messages of a dark nature left on her computer.  This mystery takes her to Las Vegas and has one of the funniest scenes with Lula I have read.  Lula may just be taking some of the best scenes from Stephanie- Stephanie should talk to the author about what is going on:-)<br /><br />Stephanie's family seems to take front page in this mystery. Her sister Valerie, is pregnant, large as a house and eating as much as she can. He boyfriend wants to marry her, but she isn't quite ready, and Valerie's two children are all living with Stephanie's mom and dad.  No one is happy about this, and the house is getting too small, especially since Grand mom lives there also.  What a mess.<br /><br />This novel is one of the better ones.

For those of us who believe that there is a reason for everything that may happen, this book gives us pause.<br /><br />Howard Beamish decided at the early age of 6 when he picked up an ammonite on Blue Anchor Beach that things were not always what they seemed. When he asked what is was he was told a stone. Howard knew it was not a stone and told his father so. This was the kind of boy Howard was and the kind<br />of man he grew into. He liked orderliness, symmetries, and classification. He wanted language to be technical, complex and innovative. He would rather read than socialize.<br />He became a lecturer at Tavistock College. He had relationships that did not last. He enjoyed sex very much but he found he did  not have much affection for the woman, and he didn't feel it was fair to carry on with that kind of attitude.<br /><br />Lucy Faulkner, on the other hand, knew at the age of fifteen that she would not follow in her mother's footsteps. Her mother was unable to tell the children their father was gone because she didn't realize it herself until Lucy told her sister that her father would not becoming back. Lucy in a sense became the mother of the family. She made sure her brother and sister had the right education for them. Lucy became a journalist. She fell off a bus and ran into a friend who happened to tell her of a job opening at a paper. Again a chance encounter and coincidence. Lucy, however, knew that she deserved the job and she became quite famous and well read. Lucy was unable to tolerate most men for very long. She loved sex but was unable to fall in love.<br /><br />Both Howard and Lucy find themselves on the same plane on their way to Nairobi. The plane has engine trouble and is diverted to a small island, Callimbia. All of the British passengers are kept hostage by a very strange dictator. Howard and Lucy find themselves falling in love in the most unusual circumstances. One of them is placed in a precarious position. Another one of Penelope Lively's simple statements- love can be found and taken away.<br /><br />This novel is fast paced and lively. The lives of the two principle characters are so rich and full. We love them both- we want happiness for them. Why must these strange situations that replicate life be so annoying?  The trauma of the daily life that accosts them may change them forever.  Another one of  Penelope Lively's wonderful books. She has such a polished style and awesome control with her words. My favorite author.<br />prisrobted to a small island, Callimbia.

I first read this book several years ago. I re-read it for a very personal reason. One of my jobs as a Nurse Care Manager is to coordinate our ALS Clinic. I am often asked for pertinent reading material, and I always recommend &#34;Tuesdays with Morrie&#34;.<br /><br />Morrie Schwartz is the kind of man we would all want to know. A professor who loves to teach and to learn. A man who has his act together so to speak. A kind, loving man with an approach to life that we learn is very particular and precise for him. He has lived his life according to his own philosophy. Mitch Albom, the author first met Morrie years ago while a student at Brandeis College in Massachusetts, and Morrie became his mentor. They lost touch as people do. Mitch saw Morrie on &#34;Nightline&#34; discussing how to live with ALS. Mitch knew instantly that he needed to see his old mentor again. Mitch was at loose ends, and he needed to reconnect with Morrie. Thus began the Tuesdays with Morrie- 14 of them, to be exact.<br /><br />The Tuesdays spent with Morrie were filled with simple platitudes. How to live the life you really want. Morrie was an expert at this. He had developed a neuromuscular disease<br /><br />called Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. There is no cure, and there is no treatment. The plan is to assist people with ALS to live their lives with quality. Almost every person I have met with ALS lives their lives to the fullest. They don't hesitate; they realize they don't have time. This is how Morrie deals with ALS. He lives his life well through his dying. Morrie doesn't dwell on the dying aspect. He has a wonderful support system. He has a family, particularly his wife and friends. He shows his love and gratitude to them on a daily basis. He does not miss a beat. They talk about everything. Morrie does not spout new words of wisdom. He talks about living your life with simplicity and connecting with those you love. Words we should all live by, but in our busy worlds, we tend to forget. Morrie knows what he wants, and he wants to live at home, without all of the complicated, expensive equipment that would keep him breathing. He dies as simply as he lives. He has given his best to Mitch. A lesson for all of us. A simple book full of ways to live your life to the fullest.

He was trying to support them all with his writing and not succeeding. He received an offer to apply for a job at this new Dot.com, Amazon. He flew to Seattle- met with Jeff Bezos in the small building that had doors as desks. The interview with Jeff was a bit bizarre- Jeff asked everyone what their SAT scores were and also included some esoteric questions. James did well and asked a question of his own, knowing Jeff's first job was working with Hedge Funds. He asked for an explanation of Hedge Funds, and how they worked. He was also interviewed by almost everyone else at Amazon and felt the excitement in the place.<br /><br />After a bit of time, James and family were ensconced in Seattle. James was the first senior editor to write reviews of the books Amazon was selling. He met some extraordinary people and had good success. He was in at the beginning, housing in a warehouse, and saw Amazon grow from a small group of 40 or so to thousands and thousands of employees. He saw the growth from email account with CompuServe or crash-prone AOl to high-speed computer software that does everything. He and the rest of the employees all went to the warehouse at Christmas time and helped wrap and pack books. They roamed all over the warehouse for each order and learned the works. James saw the explosive rise of Amazon.com and the traumatic fall, where all of his colleagues were looking over their back waiting for the \\"pink\\" slip. James survived at Amazon, and if it was not for the death of his marriage, and a new found love, he might still be there. He tells us about these colleagues, their quirks and successes. His first trip to the Chicago Book Fair, and his time manning the Amazon.com booth. The funny stories of their retreats and company picnics. The goofy things that happened, the fun and excitement of a new start-up.<br /><br />This is not a tell-all book, James wrote and perfected the first 45 word review known as\\" haiku of book criticism.\\" I am a reviewer at Amazon, and I have great interest in how the gold stars, rankings and Jeff Bezos philosophy \\"Every day is the first day of Amazon.com \\" works.

He and his ex-wife, Susanhave a daughter, Jane. They love her tremendously, and both are worried how this divorce has affected her. They are trying to move on with their lives as difficult as it seems. Matthew is involving himself in his work and his new projects. He is busying his mind and his body. All the while he is also looking at the future. Around every corner of London he is searching for something, Is it himself or is it his life that he is searching for?<br /><br />Into this lively part of Matthew's life the London he loves, Penelope Lively inserts scenes from the past. As Matthew constructs his new buildings, Lively inserts layers of history with stories that reflect the past. This is, in part, disconcerting, to have the story flow and then a new short story inserted. But, as the book proceeds we get used to this.<br /><br />Matthew meets a young woman at a sandwich Shoppe. She is short of money, and he pays for the meal. He notices how pretty she is, but she moves out of his life. He thinks of her off and on, and the next time he goes into the shop he asks the shopkeeper who this girl is. He leaves his card, just in case she stops by. In the meanwhile he goes on with his life and his buildings and raising his daughter, Jane. He meets a rather unsavory character who buys land in whatever manner he can, and then builds whatever he wants. Matthew understands this is not the life he wants and this character has an unsettling effect on him. However, this man represents to Matthew the ugly side of London and he can move on. He and Sarah, the young woman in the sandwich shop do have a relationship. Will they fall in love, and will Matthew find the happiness he deserves?<br /><br />This was not the type of novel I usually enjoy, and it was fragmented in several instances.

Berkshire gave way to Oxfordshire, Oxfordshire to Warwickshire and on to Stratfordshire. Her own past, too, waved a cheery hand from over the horizon.&quot; So, the beginning of the first book by Penelope Lively. I have grown to love this writer. She provides intelligence, perception and a thoroughly believable and interesting cast of characters. She breathes life into the characters, and her vivid style increases our enjoyment of her novels.<br /><br /> Anne Linton is a history teacher married to a stodgy, unemotional barrister. Her husband is caught up in his career and seems to take Anne for granted. Anne is caught in the middle of her life as mother to two teenagers, teacher, wife and now daughter of a man who is dying. Anne begins the fortnight drives to Lichfield to visit her father in a nursing home and to organize the house that they had lived in. The house is actually kept quite clean by the housekeeper. It is Anne's job to look at the finances and to clean out all the morass of years of things.<br /><br /> Within the years collected in papers, Anne discovers that fifteen pounds a month are being sent to an unknown woman. She mentions this to her brother, Graham, who tells her that yes; her father had a mistress for many years and this may be where the money goes. Anne is astounded; this information has changed her entire perception of her life.<br /><br /> While Anne is visiting her father a neighbor drops by. He is a headmaster of a school, and a little older than Anne. He tells her that he and her father used to go fishing regularly and formed a great friendship. Anne and David form a friendship of their own, and she meets him whenever she comes to Lichfield. The friendship deepens into something else. A startling contrast to her father? How will she resolve this affair with her present life?<br /><br /> At the same time, Anne is involved with several other townspeople in trying to save an old building from being torn down. She finds them much too aggressive and dashing forward without the information they need to proceed with intelligence. She tries to tell the group her views, but they hush her and move forward. She withdraws from this group, feeling slighted and out of sorts. Her family's importance to her becomes significant.

The beginning of a long, hot summer in Pauline Carter's greystone cottage in England, about two hours outside of London.  Pauline is copyediting an allegory of romantic love. Her daughter, Theresa, and her husband Maurice, and their son, Luke live in the second half of the cottage. Maurice is a professor and writer and is busy writing a travel journal of local places.  He often invites his editor and his girlfriend down for the weekend to help with each chapter. The issue is Maurice's infatuation with his editor's girlfriend. Oh, what memories this stirs in Pauline's heart. She fears for Theresa, who is so in love with her husband.<br /><br />Years ago, Pauline fell in love with Harry, a professor and bon vivant. Pauline and Harry married much to everyone's surprise. Harry was known as a lady's man and not the type to marry. And, in due course, Theresa was born to Pauline and Harry. Harry was not much of a father, he loved Theresa but was not involved in her life. Much the same could be said of Maurice and his behavior with Luke.  Pauline is so afraid for Theresa, she could sense imminent betrayal, and no one was speaking of it. Pauline was much respected by Maurice, but he offered no excuses nor did he feel he needed to excuse his behavior. This type of thing just happpened.<br />Penelope Lively has given us an elegant portrayal of fragile family dynamics that have already been greatly affected by adultery. Pauline will do anything to assist her daughter, and she opens her heart to Theresa. She discusses her own life with Theresa's father, and the fact that she should have left him long before she did. However, Theresa is not ready to discuss anything about her husband with Pauline at this time- denial is the name of the game. Pauline must take little steps with her daughter and support her as best she can.<br />This is once again, a book not to be put down. Penelope Lively has a habit of writing this kind of novel. The conclusion adds a form of the unusual and unexpected. I was not ready for this story to end, but the author knows best. We realize that the anxiety and suspicion we have felt has led to frustration, and now we can look at the situation with clearer eyes. This is Penelope Lively's eleventh novel, and I must read each one. She is an author unlike any other. Each book is better than the last, but how can that be?

This is a book about pleasantness which is why I have dedicated it to Mike Kelly&#34;, so says PJ O'Rourke in his new book &#34;Peace Kills: America's New Imperialism. Mike Kelly was the editor of &#34;The Atlantic&#34; until he was killed in an accident in Iraq. Mike Kelly is the kind of person you want as a friend, funny, irreverent, kind, a family man who adored his wife and children- sounds like P.J.O'Rourke as a matter of fact.<br /><br />I have adored P. J. O'Rourke for several years. P.J. O'Rourke is an admitted Libertarian, as am I. P. J. lives in New England, he moved here after 9-11. He found the kind of simple life he wanted for his family and himself. but, he also has a home in the city, Washington, D.C. so he meet and greet old friends and do his job as a writer/reporter. P.J. also appears on NPR's &#34;Wait, Wait Don't Tell Me&#34; on a semi-regular basis. All in all a man to be admired.<br />In this new book, he has put together some of his articles from &#34;The Atlantic&#34; and &#34;The Wall Street Journal&#34;. He talks about the start of the Iraq War. He was in Kuwait and was awakened by his wife in the US who called to tell him the war had started. He finally arrives in Baghdad and as he visits one of Saddam's palaces he says &#34;If a reason for invading Iraq was needed, felony interior decorating would have sufficed.&#34; Now, do you understand why I love this guy's wit? He goes on to discuss his visit to Kosovo and Israel after 9-11. But the largest portion of the book is devoted to Iraq and Kuwait. He bargains with a local for a case of beer starting at $20 and ended up paying $24.50. What a country! He concludes that we will never have Peace but we will have a war where we talk about our soldiers we can say &#34;They are our Heroes&#34;.<br /><br />P.J. O'Rourke is never dull.

Dorothea Benton Frank has written this book which<br />may be a story of her life or someone's life she knows very well.<br />Susan Hayes life falls apart when she finds her husband in her bed with a young blond. She recovers sufficiently enough to kick him out of the home. She and her daughter Beth move on to their own recovery with the help of Susan's sister Maggie. They are bound up within the life of the family. As the book proceeds we discover that Susan has another story to tell, that of her childhood, Of life on Sullivan Island near Charlestown. It is a life of abuse and neglect in some ways, but also a life of redeeming qualities. This life in some ways is similar enough to Pat Conroy; the same type of very angry father, meek wife and 6 children who receive the brunt of the abuse. However, the redeeming quality is Livvie, their black housekeeper.<br />Livvie saves their lives. She will not allow for any abuse of the children as long as she is in the house. She of the gleaming floors and tables, clean washed white sheets and tables full of mouth watering food. As long as Livvie is around there will be some parenting and love.  But Livvie is not around all the time and the abuse and beating goes on.  A kind hearted sheriff steps in and threatens the father and it works for a bit.<br />The father is a man with demons as you might well expect. Except in this story we are to believe that he is also a man who tries to help the black community.  A little too far fetched is this part of the story. A little too much of the chance of romantic encounters that must make the love of a life time. A little too much of everything must be fixed and psychoanalyzed and set right. There is a mystery to be solved, but it is not much of a surprise. This book has a wonderful setting with characters to be believed, but then something is out of context. Everyone must be happy, and everything must be fixed.  Dorothea Benton Frank has a way with characters and a way of writing that excites us. She has a tale to tell but tells it too completely.

He was beloved by many and respected by many. He was one of the few political reporters that I believe gave us both sides of the story. He always spoke with eloquence and intelligence, and when he spoke, we listened.<br /><br />\\"People do not die for us immediately, but remain bathed in a sort of aura of life which bears no relation to true immortality but through which they continue to occupy our thoughts in the same way as when they were alive.  It is as though they were traveling abroad.\\"  ~Marcel Proust<br /><br />We all know Tim Russert as the moderator of \\"Meet the Press\\", and now we meet Tim Russert, son of Big Russ. Tim Russert tells the story of growing up in Buffalo, and how he grew to be the man he is today has much to do with the father he idolizes. His father is his hero. This is a story of love, family love, religious love, love of sports, love of people and love of life.<br /><br />Much of this book has to do with the lessons learned at the knee of Big Russ. Big Russ was a hard worker- he loved his family, a wife and four children. Big Russ learned his love of life in the Army. He was in World War II and was badly injured in a plane accident. Big Russ learned valuable lessons that day- he was saved from certain death by another soldier who threw caution to the wind to save his brother soldier. Big Russ is a reticent man who does not talk much about his experiences, as is common with WWII soldiers. It took Tim Russert many years to learn about his dad and about his experiences in the Army. Tim Russert once said the person he most wanted to interview was his own dad!<br /><br />Tim Russert had an idyllic childhood, but it was not an easy life. He worked hard at school and hard at home. He came from a family who loved him and taught him many lessons. The family was Catholic, and his entire education was completed at Jesuit's schools. Food was a big part of their life. Big Russ worked two jobs to give his family a home, clothing and food on the table. There is an entire chapter talking about the food of the Russert home and the food of Buffalo. The roast beef weck sandwich is one of the famous foods of Buffalo but it is the Buffalo chicken wings that are the best known.<br /><br />Tim Russert goes on to tell about his life, college, law school, working for Senator Moynihan and Governor Cuomo. He was well liked and as always a very hard worker. His work with these politicians was noted, and he was picked by NBC to work in the news division. He became the news Director of the Washington Bureau, and was later asked to be the moderator of \\"Meet the Press\\". He has made \\"Meet the Press' the most popular Sunday political show on television. He credits his success to Big Russ who told him to be himself, and to always tell the truth, and to ask questions the little guys would ask.<br /><br />Tim Russert met and married a reporter, Maureen Orth, in 1983, and in 1985 one of the most important days of his life occurred with the birth of his son, Luke. Luke is a much beloved son, and from the stories Tim Russert tells, we know that Luke must idolize his dad much as Tim does Big Russ.<br /><br />Tim Russert has made a success of his life. He attributes much of his success to his father. Tim Russert can best describe his father with this sentence taken from Gail Godwin's book<br />\\"Father Melancholy's Daughter\\".<br />\\"He lived his life by the grace of daily obligations.\\"<br /><br />This is a book to be read again and again. Full of stories of hope and goodness and love and life. It is a feel good book. A story of the life of one of our best political reporters. I believe that Tim Russert is one of the  most respected man in America.<br /><br />Tim Russert told us that Bruce Springsteen was one of the people he most wanted to interview.

Mrs. Nancy. Hawkins, the main character is a woman that everyone depends upon and needs to talk with. She has that certain way about her that summons trust and understanding. The fact that her figure is zaftig and that she is a widow lends credence she believes to her trust factor.<br />Mrs. Hawkins tells her story from a 30 year distance. It is 1954, post World War II, and she is living in a furnished room near Kensington. She has several neighbors of interest and Milly the landlady, was one of the more interesting. She was also a widow and was<br />Known as an organizer, She was able to organize everyone and everything. Basil and Eva Carlin were a quiet couple and lived on the first floor. Wanda Podolak lived next to them. She was a Polish dressmaker. Kate Parker lived at the end of the hall. She was a district nurse and suffered no germs at all- she was constantly cleaning. On the attic floor, lived a medical student William Todd.<br />Mrs. Hawkins was an editor at a publishing house and in due time she lost her job and went on to several others. She was excellent at her job, and, of course, everyone confided in her. She knew everything that was going on with everyone. Like the rooming house she lived in, Mrs. Hawkins spent her days and evenings giving advice. The rooming house becomes involved with Wanda and her anonymous letters that turn into blackmail and eventually into big trouble. Along the way, we meet Hector Bartlett, a charlatan who turns many lives upside down.<br /><br />Mrs. Hawkins gives advice to many and one day she looks in the mirror and discovers that she is too obese. She resolves to lose weight, and by eating only half portions and then quarter portions, she does just that. Her fine bone structure is revealed, and her new body structure also attracts many men. She finds herself in a relationship with William Todd the medical student, which eventually turns into a marriage. Thirty years later,<br />Mrs. Hawkins, so wonderfully happy with her life in Italy, &#34;a far cry from Kensington&#34;,<br />looks back at her life and continues to offer us advice.<br />Muriel Sparks has been called &#34;Britain's greatest living novelist&#34;, and she was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1993 and Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres in 1996.

Outrageous, hilarious, living life to the fullest, ignorant of house cleaning behaviours, and more to the point someone who would be such a good friend! Hollis has depicted her life in a series of vignettes searching for a home to buy in Atlanta.<br />Hollis found the title of her book one day when she was driving, and almost ran over a man she didn't see. He yelled at her &quot;You Bleachy-Haired Honky Bitch!&quot; *%$*%$ etc., and Hollis realized she had found the title of her book.<br />Hollis tells us of her life with her parents- a father who is an alcoholic and unable to maintain a steady job. Her mother,who had wanted to become a beautician, but became a weapons designer instead. Hollis, her brother and two sisters moved with her parents from job to job all over the country. It is in this manner that Hollis developed her pysche or what she calls one. She is a little off-center, a little too cute at times.<br />Hollis believes that one must live their life to the fullest- why go half-way, push the throttle. And that is exactly what she does. She moves to Greece to become a serious writer and has more funny and interesting experiences because she is so open to them. She used to love to drink and take a few drugs and to go to carnivals, and she did this with her friends. Daniel, Grant and Lary are a big part of this book- many of the subtle and not so subtle yarns are about these three men. Hollis is most herself it seems when she is using four letter words, and this may be off-putting if you don't understand the context.<br />Each autobiographical tale that composes this book does not seem to follow any order- unless random order is what you are seeking. Hollis is a regular commentator on NPR's &quot;All Things Considered&quot; and writes a column called &quot;Mood Swing&quot; in an Atlanta alternative weekly. Hollis writes well, and if the articles in this book followed some sort of series I would have found it more put together. As is, the book is well done and we understand a little better how Hollis has become the original she is. Highly recommended. prisrobit more put together.

In Alice Thomas Ellis's novel \\"The Inn At the Edge of The World\\", we are introduced to five people who are trying to escape the Christmas season. They have all responded to an ad in the London weeklies to \\"ignore Christmas at an inn at the edge of the world\\" The inn is off a remote coast of Scotland.<br />Eric owns the Inn, and his wife Mabel helps out at times. Eric wanted to move to this part of the world from London because of his wife. Mabel has a tendency to go out and party and he knows not what else she does. How Eric talked Mabel into joining him at this God forsaken place is beyond understanding They are unhappy together, and it appears later unhappy apart.  Eric is not making ends meet at the Inn, and he comes up with the idea of Christmas at the edge of the world. He will be able to accept 5-7 people over Christmas and then maybe his world will turn right.<br />The five people who decide to answer the ad are an interesting group. Each, of course, has their own story. Harry, a military man, who has lost his wife and son.  Harry has a fascination with General Charles Gordon and the last days of Khartoum. He has enough information to write his own book. Jessica is recently separated from her man, Mike. She is a voice-over commercial artist and actress. Jon, a sometimes actor, who is obsessed with Jessica. Anita, a salesperson in the stationary department of a store. And, Ronald, a psychoanalyst who's wife has recently left him. These five people meet and spend the days of Christmas together. However, their miseries just shift with them from one locale to the next. Their being who they are rules out their finding what they profess to be in search of.  As in all of Alice Thomas Ellis's novels, the uncanny, the mystic, the strange confront all of them. Because they can only use their everyday reasoning, they remain unenlightened and return to things as they were and as they most certainly will remain.<br />On this island there is simply another order of reality. There is a supernatural fable woven into this story that gets to the heart of what is missing in the poor, lost souls who came looking for change and understanding.

This may all be true. but this book, a collection of her writings is fairly uneven. She is a great writer, but not all of the articles are worthy of this book.<br />Susie is apparently a well known ranking connoisseur of sex, porn, and physical expression. This is the first book of hers that I have read. She is quite entertaining, not at all disturbing or too sexually advanced. She is a writer of sexual overtones, telling us that whatever we enjoy is ok.<br />This novel was written over 12 years of her daughter Aretha's life. The first chapter is about Aretha and her reaction to her mother's job- writing about sex.  They are excellent sand spell out the shame and then joy Aretha feels about her mom's choices.<br />The next five chapters titled \\"Who wants to be a sex guru?\\" are not as well done. She talks about Viagra, internships and nudist colonies.<br />Porno land is the third set of chapters- a very real and sometimes funny look at this side of the underworld.  She examines her job as a consultant for a movie. She is blunt and free and brings out the best of everyone!<br />The most enjoyable group of chapters is Susie's \\"My So-Called Sex Life\\". She recounts her experiences while on a book tour. How to talk to the maitre'd about those little needs you can't talk about publicly. The book tour diary and people she has met, and finally the Farmer in the Dell.<br />Susie ends her book by giving us a recipe for real cherry pie- not canned cherries, but the real thing- bing  and queen anne. This is the recipe that you use when you want someone to fall in love with you.  Recipe for pie pastry- I think Martha Stewart's is better, but they are both delicious.

This is the 16th novel in the Inspector Rebus series. Inspector John Rebus is a man with a rakish sense of humour and a dry wit. He is a loner. He has a past, and we are given a glimpse every now and then. He is as finely wrought a character as I have seen. He is a man after my own heart. I have always wanted to be a spy in the CIA and this comes close enough.<br />Rebus is in the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh. It appears that Rebus has scalded both hands and infection has set in. Did this happen as he says by putting his hands in scalding water for too long a period of time? It would appear that this might be too coincidental since Fairstone, a man who was stalking Detective Sargeant Siobhan Clarke, has just died in a fire. Siobhan is also wondering if Rebus came to her defense and killed the man.<br />Detective Clarke is here in hospital to relate to Rebus the horrible events that have just happened in South Queensbury. An ex-SAS or army man had walked into a private school, turned his gun on three young men and then killed himself. What was this slaughter all about?  What was the motive, was it revenge?<br />Rebus is called upon by Detective Inspector Bobby Hogan to come to Queensbury to assist him in the investigation. Rebus is an ex-army man himself and may have insight into the why's and where's.<br />Siobhan must accompany him since he cannot drive. His hands are bandaged and he is taking medication with his whiskey to stave off the pain.<br />There is no mystery about whodunit. A creep, a loner, an army veteran who got his kicks out of terrifying the local teenagers in his speedboat. A man gone mad? Were the killings random? Why  did this man bypass other rooms and go directly to the student lounge? With his superiors breathing down his neck, Rebus immerses himself into the investigation. He finds a family link and is drawn into the questions, &quot;why does a man kill, is it a matter of revenge or a question of blood?&quot;<br />This is about as good as it gets in a Rebus novel. The characters are finely drawn, dark and gritty. The storyline is carefully detailed. We get a closer and more intimate look at Rebus the man.

He is a professional voyeur who becomes a more ruthless activist during this novel.

They have become stranges who meet in the night. Jack has a good relationship with both mom and dad, but not at the same time. Miles is proud of his son but not much mention is made of the years that they all spent together.<br />The action is fast paced in this book. Miles is part of the Latchkey group- surveilling an Arab with the codename, Latchkey. Someone was setting bombs all over London, and Latchkey was the prime suspect-it all goes bad when the suspect kills an Israeli  official while Miles misses the clues. The Office is not happy with Miles and he is moved to a new job &quot;Harvest&quot;. During this time, Miles understands that something is not quite &quot;cricket&quot;.

Letter format has not been a favorite of mine, but the author brings these women to life in a extraordinary manner.<br />Clara is a school teacher and lives alone in her deceased father's home. Clara was her father's favorite, and seems to be a lot like him, frugal and conservative. She is prone to think of excuses why she should not have a telephone or a radio.

However, she expresses her poetry to us, the readers in a compelling narrative.

She has organized these books into 175 useful,creative and humorous lists. These lists are quite specific and the Table of Contents lists them in alphabetical order. The one critique is that not enough information is given about the books, but maybe that was her intent. Just maybe she wants us to find out that information for ourselves.<br />I have gone through each list and found enough books that interest me to give me reading material for the next couple of years. I have purchased several.<br />Some of my favorites are:<br />Action Heroines-the usual VI Warshawski and Kinsey Milhorne but several new ones like Susan Van Meter and Paul Flint.<br />Adventure by the Book- Fiction and Non-fiction-Huckleberry Finn and National Geographic.<br />Hamilton Basso: Too Good To Miss-New Orleans Southern writer like &quot;View From Pompeii's Head&quot;.<br />Bird Brains- books for and by birders<br />Fathers and Daughters and Fathers and Sons-Solomon's Daughter and Gambler's Rose<br />First Lines Too Remember-&quot;First I had to get his body into the boat&quot;.<br />First Novels-Virgin Suicides, Stern Men, Biggest Elvis<br />The Islamic World-Islam: A Short History<br />The Moon's My Destination-Apollo- Epic Journey to the Moon<br />Shrinks and Shrinkees-I Never Promised You A Rose garden<br />Three Hanky Reads-A Lesson Before Dying<br />Texas, A Lone Star State of Mind-The Last Picture Show<br />Zero: This Will Mean Nothing To You-The Hole in the Universe<br />All together, 256 pages of books organized into themes that make sense. I really liked this book. I found it light reading, but full of great information.I will use this as a reference book for the times when I need a book of a particular theme, or a need for a book I can't quite put my finger on.<br />If you are just starting out on a reading life, this book is for you.

This story of a New England boy's prep school in the 1960's is told in first person. The clincher is we never hear the tellers name, nor do we know what he looks like, but if I heard him speak in a crowd I would know him!<br />We hear the story of his sixth form or senior year from a literary perspective. We meet his roommate Bill White and learn of his Jewish heritage, only by chance and not mentioned at all by Bill. George Kellogg, the literary review editor is a friend and foe. A fellow writer and a winner of one esteemed writing contests. And then there are the two Jeff Purcells,two other adversarial foes, little Jeff and big Jeff, cousins to the core.<br />There was a tradition at the school where a famous writer was invited to the school to meet and greet, and one of the lucky boys had a private audience. To win this audience, the boys must write a story or a poem and the writer would get to choose which one he considered the best.  Robert Frost and Ayn Rand were but two of these illustrious  authors. One of the most interesting chapters in the book, is Ayn Rand's visit. The story teller got out of a sick bed (flu, runny nose, cough)to go to a private meeting with this author and some of the boys. The story teller was such a fan of \\"Fountainhead\\"- he had read it 4 times, and HAD to meet the author. He was disappointed and disgusted with Ayn Rand and her treatment of his friend and of the headmaster. He felt she was rude and obnoxious, and he becomes an avowed ex-fan of Ayn Rand.<br />Ernest Hemingway was the next famous author to come to the school, and the storyteller had to win the private audience with him. He did win this prize, and the last chapters of the book describe the entire episodes leading up to this event in full regalia.  The writing of his story that won the \\"best\\" prize, and the aftermath is an enigma. The ending of the book was a disappointment to me, I wanted more- I wanted to know and understand the full implications of the story tellers mischief.<br />Tobias Wolff has written a page turner- buy the book, read it, and enjoy it. prisrobhe full implications of the story tellers mischief.<BR>Tobias Wolff has written a page turner- buy the book, read it, and enjoy it. prisrob	2003-12-14

To have the skill to bake and cook well is a joy. To know the people who cook and bake so well they have wrtten several cookbooks is even more wonderful. The Blanchards have been an &quot;Upper Valley&quot; treasure for years. They first started out with Blanchard and Blanchard Salad Dressings, and were the first to mix herbs and unusual ingredients into delicious salad dressings.<br />Mel and Robert Blanchard live in Norwich, Vermont and have a restaurant in Anguilla. Mel is not an educated chef, but a born and bred true cook. Her recipes are simple and so good. Cheddar Cheese soup, cheese and onion bake (tastes like the topping on french onion soup, and is used as a side dish for their New England Thanksgiving on Anguilla) One of the most delicious and unusual recipes is Vermont Picnic Ham with dark beer. Scrambled eggs with herb cheese and chives, surrounded by roasted small tomatoes is mouth watering. Pair that with peach, coconut breakfast bread and you have the makings of a scrumptious brunch.<br />The Blanchards use simple ingredients because much of what they make must be flown into Anguilla. They use the fruits and vegetables native to Anguilla. At the heart of their cooking continues the use of herbs, fresh and dried. Each recipe is unusual and can be made at any time. None of the ingredients are seasonal or that unusual. Their particular blending of the herbs and other ingredients, however, give their cooking 5 star quality. I recommend this cookbook for anyone, and it will be under the Christmas tree of many of my friends and family. Can't wait to get back to that ham.  prisrob	2003-12-06

This book tells their story and that of the two young men who committed this crime. I have ambivalent feelings about this book- it is very well written and the authors have given much detail about the lives of all involved, but this murder took place in my community, and the wounds are still raw. Dick Lehr and Mitchell Zuckoff, are Boston Globe columnists and followed this case day by day. They interviewed many of the people involved in the lives of the Zantops, Robert Tulloch and Jum Parker. They have been able to give an account of the shock and grief both communities felt in the aftermath.<br />Half and Susanne Zantop came to Dartmouth College from Germany. They wanted to open their world to their two young daughters. In the midst of living their lives, they touched many in the Dartmouth and Hanover community. Half was considered one of the best educators in his Geology department and at Dartmouth. Susanne was a much loved professor of the German department. Both were in their mid fifties and looking at early retirement. They were a very active couple and had lived their lives to the fullest. They had two daughters who were just starting their adult lives.<br />James Tulloch was an eighteen year old from a small community in Vermont. His life is shared in bits and pieces, and we are able to see that something is terribly wrong in this young man but a murderer? James Parker is his younger friend. They have a bond and have the feeling of &#34;us against the world&#34;. They were adventurers and wanted to go to Austrailia and live the life they deserved. In their fantasies they would glean the monies needed by killing their victims and accumulating the money needed to flee. The book tells the story of their attempts to rob and plunder, and the mistakes they made. No one in their community really knew these young men or could have foretold the paths they were establishing.<br />One cool grey day in January of 2001, Robert and James headed towards Hanover, NH, a town of well-to-do people. A town that neither boy liked or visited often. On a previous day they had searched the town for likely victims. The first home they visited was empty, they moved to the next home and Half Zantop answered. The young men posed as Vershire School studnets interested in the environement and asked Half to participate in a survey. As a professor of Geology, Half was involved in keeping the enviornment clean and invited the young men into his home. At some point during the survey, Half remarked that the young men were not well prepared. This infuriated Robert and he lunged at Half and slit his throat- Susanne hearing the commotion ran into the room and Robert yelled to James to kill her. James hesitated a moment and then slit Susanne's throat. The boys had bought knives over the internet to use for this crime. When they were sure the Zantops were dead, they took Half's wallet and left.<br />A friend of the Zantops came to their home in early evening to have dinenr with them- found the front door unlocked and walked in. She came to the study and found the grisly scene- she left hurriedly and drove to the neighbors where she screamed for help. The neighbors called 911 and went with her to the Zantops home.<br />The ensuing half of the book describes the investigation and the<br />people involved ,and how the many clues left at the scene helped the local police and State Police to find these young men. They were questioned at their homes. In the dead of night the boys left and fled to Indiana where they were picked up. The flight and the local authorities and their stories are told in detail. the boys were brought back to New Hampshire and charged with murder. After delibertion, James Parke became a State's witness ande gave up his best friend, Robert to save his life. He was charged with being an accomplice to murder and given 25 years to life. Robert Tulloch decided a trial was not in his best interest and pleaded guilty. He received a life sentence with no chance of parole. Both young men are at the NH State prison. James Parker is a model prisoner. Robert Tulloch is considered a risk and a troublemaker.<br />Judgment Ridge is a small ridge near Chelsea, Vermont, the boys hometown. It is a fitting title for this book. The judgment shown by these boys is hard to fathom. The lives destroyed are too numerous to count. This is an account of a gruesome crime and its aftermath. How could these young man kill innocent people? Robert Tulloch is probably a psycopath with no remorse and his partner, James Parker was brought willing into a situation where he did not think of the consequences- he was a follower. Both communites are left to ponder what went wrong and how could this happen. This book attempts to answer these questions and does an admirable job.

It has a unique charm, the older parts of the city are being revamped, and the newest parts of the city are sytlish and upbeat. Portland is not a tourist trap, in fact, the city is fairly empty on weekends. Chuck Palahniuk introduces us to a different Portland. One I was not certain I wanted to know- he writes in a humourous vein that belies the serious stories and charms of the city. However, once I got used to his style I started to enjoy the story of his life in Portland.  After he graduated from high school in Washington state, he moved to Portland. Most of his freinds moved to Seattle, but he wanted a different view. He rented an apartment with two friends. These friends stole their food supplies from the restaurants they each worked in- champagne and escargot- each night after work escargot was microwaved, and as they got a little high on champagne they would throw food on the walls.<br /> As the book proceeds,we receive a tour of the city's strip and sex joints, a view of Powell's, the most famous book store on the West Coast and museums we would not ordinarly enter. The author meets, greets and interviews many characters to introduce the varied stories that highlight the old Portland that Chuck Palahniuk grew to love.  As a side note this is one of several  Crown tours of cities by well known authors- I am eagerly awaiting Kinky Friedman's book of Austin and Ray Bount Jr's book of New Orleans. The map of Portland is not familiar at first view but will be by the end of the book. I thoroughly enjoyed this view of Portland and will remember it every time I visit the city. prisrob	2003-09-07

Her story intrigued me and I bought her book. Jane has been in the food reviewing business with her husband for awhile- radio and Gourmet magazine. She found herself sitting in front of her TV, a real couch potato, afraid to move or go anywhere. Eventually Jane realized that she needed some expertise and assistance to help her through this period of anxiety and depression. Through a great deal of work and some pharmaceutical assitance Jane has learned to live through her depression. One outlet was to become an EMT- by helping others she is helping herself- she is less drawn to angst about her own issues. As a health care provider I can understand how you can become engrossed in other people's medical and emergency issues by helping them through this critical time, and how rewarding it is to know you were responsible for a litle piece of this person's care. Jane has also learned that she has to leave the dark, difficult emergency situations at the office, so to speak. She cannot dwell on those she cannot save or those stories too bleak to think about.

His vivid portrayal of the grunts and soldiers who lived and died for their country was seen on<br />television on a nightly basis. The real war came home for the first time.<br /><br />&quot;The Cat from Hue&quot; continues this theme with more details and behind the scene stories told from his viewpoint and often from the words of the original speaker. There are many interviews with tht original soldiers, written in their voice.  So well written I feel I am &quot;In Country&quot;- a book hard to put down- not much is left out -Vietnam in first person.<br /><br />I saw John Laurence on C-Span, being interviewed about his novel. And, he was just as remembered. He told us that the Vietnam War changed his life, as it did for all who were part of this War. He has made a mark in the field of journalism for his courgeous stories told in the field of fire. Highly recommended. prisrob	2002-01-31
