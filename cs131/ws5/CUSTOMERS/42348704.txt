Written in an easily digestible manner, it contains a substantial overview of the chain of events, plus some interesting minutiae on the various Axis and Allied formations and divisions, weapons, significant individuals, as well as an unparalleled collection of photographs. <br />It's fairly light on text, however, and those looking for something to chew over would do better to examine the works of Antony Beevor and Alan Clark, but as it stands, 'Battle Of Crete' would make a fine addition to any budding war historian's shelves. The volume itself is handsomely printed and of reassuring weight and design, certain to last through many extended readings. It may strike some as a little expensive, but for the breadth of information contained within it is worth the outlay.	2004-02-16

Army from the Normandy Beaches to the Bulge to the Surrender of Germany	Books	1	32	69	N	N	More of the same from Ambrose	After moaning my way through the equally large 'D-Day' by Mr. Ambrose, I thought I would give him one last shot, and to that end I secured myself a copy of 'Citizen Soldiers'.<br />Firstly, allow me to say that Stephen Ambrose is not an historian in the proper sense. There is a significant difference between relating easily-located historical facts, and unearthing them for oneself. Ambrose is one who condenses unwieldy masses of fact into a single digestible volume, which is what college students do with every essay, and which television news producers do nightly at six.<br />The difference between Ambrose and a college student or news producer is his entertaining writing style. His is truly &quot;mass history&quot;, history for the masses, writing which passes easily through the eyes and into the brain, where it roams around for a while before being discarded. It's good enough stuff for a long flight or a soak in the bath, but nothing you'd sit down for any length of time and puzzle over, or elaborately annotate, or extract notes from. His books have always struck me as 'Military History For Dummies', which is an important enough thing, as it's good to make such important information easily accessible to the uneducated public.<br />What irritates me about Ambrose, though, is his irrational and unmitigated biais towards all things American. Drawing only on the books of Ambrose one would imagine that America was not only the only allied force to fight in World War II, but is in fact the only nation on earth. He regularly goes out of his way to dismiss or degrade the efforts of other allied forces, specifically those of Britain and its Commonwealth. And I really do mean it when I say &quot;goes out of his way&quot;, for rarely are these frankly insulting remarks attached to any logical argument that has been laid down beforehand - they're just randomly dropped in there. He is well known as a Brit basher, and 'Citizen Soldiers' and 'D-Day' serve only to reinforce and then enhance this reputation.<br />Further to all that, I have a hard time in attaching any relevance to his frequent comments regarding the American Civil War, Little Big Horn, the Alamo, and any number of nationally-contained American conflicts. He just waffles on and on about those things, and the only reason for it seems to be to encourage readers to buy his other books on those subjects.<br />In all, it's hard to recommend Ambrose to anybody but an historical imbecile, or a virgin WW2 reader. His national prejudice is uncontrolled and it is equally shocking that no editor ever dared to rein him in regarding such matters. It's all very well and good and noble to be proud of your country, but not at the expense of others. In fact, it isn't out of line to apply a single unhappy word to Mr. Ambrose: racist. He is, pure and simple, an American supremacist. He is, to be perfectly plain, a racist and bigoted selective collator of information.<br />The next time you are confronted with a wall of Ambrose novels (I have difficulty in considering them as anything other) at the bookstore, you would do well to take a peek on either side, and see what grabs you.<br />As it stands, I shall be packing my Ambrose down to the book exchange later today, to swap them for something more refreshing and intelligent and less annoying. And as for yourself, take a dig around in Amazon's extensive WW2 history sections - there are countless numbers of smaller works of greater historical merit than all of Ambrose combined.	2004-02-16

That's not gung-ho fairy tales, kids. That's rootin'-tootin' FACT.<br />If you think I'm full of it, then I recommend you take a look at this bloated offering by eminent (and also dead) Yankee historian Stephen Ambrose. Approximately 90% of the book is dedicated to repetitive and unenlightening (though, it must be said, utterly enthralling and devastating) GI recollections of the landings on Utah and Omaha, with very little attention paid to the other Allied operations on Gold, Juno or Sword, or in Normandy as a whole. Countless hundreds of thousands of British, Canadians, and yes, even Australian and New Zealand (though you would have been hard pressed to find more than a dozen of those fellows floating about) all did their part and, in many cases, paid the ultimate sacrafice on 6 June, 1944, but these courageous men and women hardly merit a mention in the eyes of Mr. Ambrose.<br />This will not come as any surprise to those familiar with his other work, notably 'Band Of Brothers' and 'Citizen Soldiers'. After all, Stephen Ambrose was an American historian, and therefore, the bulk of his primary material would have been gleaned from American sources which, as we have seen recently, are very rarely critical of themselves. But some of his offhand comments are downright insulting, as when he postulates that the British essentially milled about drinking tea at their beaches.<br />None of this is meant to be dismissive of the massive (though slightly delayed) contribution that America and American soldiers, sailors and airforcemen made to the invasion of Europe and eventual collapse of the Nazi Party. There is no question that they were a brave, hard-fighting lot, who paid with their lives so that the world could be free. Australia will forever be thankful to America for its help out here in the Pacific, in such engagements as Battle of the Coral Sea, in stemming and then turning back the Japanese marauders. Make no mistake, the USA and its men and women did their fair share in keeping the world safe. But they weren't the only ones, and it's a shame Ambrose seems to think that way.<br />In the end, though, for Yank readers and assorted governing bodies, who seem a pretty self-congratulatory lot, this will no doubt be held high as first-class history for a long long time to come.<br />But for everybody else, Stephen Ambrose's 'D-Day', as a history, is uneven at best and completely infuriating at worst. However, as a rollicking blockbuster airport novel that can be chewed down and then immediately tossed aside, you could certainly do a lot worse.	2003-11-17

I read this collection, originally, about ten years ago. As I recall, I found it quite entertaining, though a few of the essays were beyond me (not so much in scope - their content was simply unfamiliar and, frankly, boring). Having nothing better to do, I decided to revisit Mr. Johnson, and dipped into the collection with what I hoped would be teary-eyed, reminiscing glee. <br />Unfortunately, as these things go, I was horribly disappointed. I like to think that I've learned a few things in ten years, and one of those things is that I can tell good, informative and entertaining writing from self-aggrandizing tossycock. To put it in the crudest way: Johnson is an old fuddy-duddy of the highest order, and these essays, after fermenting for so many years, come across as twee at best and nauseating at worst.<br />As far as I can tell, Johnson was in his late sixties when this volume was first released, so I suppose that now he's either much older or dead altogether. In any event, judging from the content of this pretentious and egotistical series of columns from his stint at The Spectator, he will in all likelihood not be missed.	2003-07-04

The sole purpose of philosophy is thus: to assist us (that is to say, humanity) in understanding our internal and our external universes.<br />Philosophy should not be prejudiced. It should be accessible to, and comprehended by, all of us. If the universal truths that any given piece of philosophy purports to represent are not accessible to, and comprehended by, all of us, then that philosophy has failed.<br />Kant is an elitist, pure and simple. He writes philosophy for a select few (other philosophers, it would seem), and not for humanity in general. This critique of his is nothing more than a twisting, baffling exploration of verbosity. Kant's inability to logically and comprehensibly structure his thought processes, instead rendering his theories unclear and incomprehensible, marks nothing more than his failure as a proper philosopher.<br />Plato's philosophy was for the masses. Any reasonably intelligent individual can easily digest his arguments. There are dozens of other popular philosophers just as good, and better than, Plato. Their philosophies are remarkably informative, useful, and well-written. Kant is uninformative, useless, and poorly penned. If you have read this, and understood it, and then applied it, then you are to be commended. But that's not many of you.<br />My suggestion: avoid this unless you are looking to punish yourself. Your education, with Kant as a guide, will give you nothing more than an increasing understanding of your own ignorance. Philosophy is meant to be refreshing and fulfilling. The `Critique of Pure Reason' is not.	2003-06-19

Fascinating and enlightening in places, and intensely irritating in others. Without doubt Magee is a smart man, but he is by no means a philosopher. Indeed, one of the arguments postulated by him in this very tome is that philosophers must in some way contribute to humanity's understanding of itself and its universe. While Magee's body of work (including this volume) certainly contributes to our understanding of *philosophy*, that's about the end of it. On top of that, Chapter 2 appears to be nothing more than his entry into the \\"mention your tenure at Oxford as many times as you can in a single paragraph\\" competition that I understand is being held globally at the moment, and Chapter 16 is his \\"ooh, look, I done wrote me a book!\\", which is utterly pointless because what are we reading?<br />In any event, as I say, good in places, painful and egoist in others.

US	42348704	R2ZDLNSKBP4SNU	0930289455	837360744	Batman: The Killing Joke	Books	3	0	7	N	N	A fun romp...	...but ultimately pointless. Adds nothing to the Batman legacy, but takes nothing away. It's just there, but any self-respecting Batman collector already owns it, and already knows this. Those searching for a weightier Batman story should look elsewhere.	2003-05-13

An enjoyable, interesting and somewhat enlightening read for fans of Mr Campbell or `Army of Darkness' in particular, B-movie fans in general, and those interested in independent/guerilla filmmaking. Campbell writes well and drops a few amusing anecdotes, but it's not exactly world-shattering stuff.	2003-05-13

I bought a copy of this volume under the (as it turns out, false) impression that it would provide me with some level of entertainment, a mindless nugget between one thing and another.<br />Let me assure you that it is, indeed, mindless. While full marks must go to Mr. Fforde for the admittedly excellent premise (evil overlord wreaks havoc by stealing classic manuscripts and transporting himself into their pages, more or less) and for actually getting the thing published, be warned that it has nothing whatsoever to do with sly winks, \\"postmodernism played out as raw, howling farce\\" or, indeed, story or narrative.<br />The antagonist, Thursday Next (a dull play on words, along with most of the other characters, notably Jack Schitt) is completely devoid of character and personality, with a contrived background that would make even the most toad-like of Hollywood hacks wince. Nothing ever really happens in the story - it simply plays out as a jumble of clich&eacute;d encounters and undergraduate references to some of the most boring/obscure pieces of literature on the planet, a hodgepodge of puerile jokes formulated by an author with far too many volumes of reference on his shelves, and not nearly enough books.<br />The very thought that I wasted a day reading this rubbish sets my teeth on edge. Only hip posers whose literary backgrounds began and ended when they were forced to read 'Catcher In The Rye' in year nine and now figure that they know everything and can go back to bleaching their hair and learning to roll cigarettes.<br />If the core of the book appeals to you - ostensibly wacky adventures of a private investigator in an ostensibly wacky parallel universe - you'd do far better to read either of Douglas Adams' Dirk Gently books. If you already have, then it's time to move on, because you won't find a shadow of those masterpieces here.	2003-01-21
