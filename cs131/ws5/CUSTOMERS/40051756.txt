When one looks over the vast array of American Literature, there are but a few books that are ranked in a class by themselves.  They include such novels as \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\", \\"The Scarlet Letter\\", \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\", and \\"The Jungle\\".  In any \\"greatest list\\" I've seen, \\"Moby Dick\\" always shows up.  In fact, only Huckleberry Finn draws more support as the Great American Novel.  With this in mind, I decided that it was high time I read \\"Moby Dick\\".  In doing so, I was prepared to appreciate a classic with my only misgivings being my tendency to get bogged down in the tedium of the 19th Century style of prose.   <br /> <br />I admit that I was fairly satisfied with the first part of the novel and I was proceeding along fine until Ismael turned into the world's greatest authority on the subject of whales and whaling.  I may have missed a point or two but I was sure that Ismael's self-introduction identified him as a merchant marine who was embarking on on his first whaling voyage.  He must have been doing a lot of reading on the voyage because he proceeded to tell me more that I ever wanted to know about whales and whaling. <br /> <br />I read \\"Moby Dick\\" to enjoy a story; not to engorge myself with, for me, uninteresting trivia.  The facts overwhelmed the story and I was losing interest fast.  I finally started to speed read my way through the final 50 pages and all of the accompanying \\"Billy Budd\\".  I have seldom been so happy to finish a book and I even entertained the thought of just chucking the book and not even finishing it.  I realize that there are many thousands of people out there for whom the sea is an enchantress.  I also understand that Captain Ahab's maniacal search for the great white whale has allegoties about ourselves (although I wasn't all that motivated to dwell on that subject). <br /> <br />\\"Moby Dick\\" is not the first classic to fall short in my estimation and I'm sure it won't be the last.  I mentioned above that I don't care for 19th Century Literature in general (Henry James \\"The Turn of the Screw\\" put me to sleep).  However, Mark Twain is my favorite author and he seemed to be able to communicate his stories in an enjoyable yet profound way.  Oh well,  to each his own.   <br />	2005-10-13
US	40051756	R3DMIS5IH8EHBV	0385477139	309626697	Cracking the Show	Books	3	7	7	N	N	Ode to the Orioles	I have enjoyed reading other works by Thomas Boswell including \\"Why Time Begins on Opening Day\\", \\"How Life Imitates the World Series\\" and \\"The Heart of the Order\\".  I found Boswell to be one of the very best baseball writers in America.  I guess that's why I was so disappointed in \\"Cracking the Show\\".  In the aforementioned books, Boswell gives a great and impartial perspective of major league baseball.  In \\"Cracking the Show\\", he seem to hit nothing but \\"homers\\".  I realize that Boswell writes from that neck of the woods and it seems logical to write about what you know best.  I will also admit that I had a very sincere respect for the Orioles of the late 70's and early 80's when I lived in Milwaukee.  As the Brewers were rising to their lone American League pennant, it was the Orioles, not the Yankees, we feared (and respected) the most.  Billy Martin was a side show; Earl Weaver was a genius.  However, Weaver retired and things changed (boy did they ever for the Brewers!).  In his previous books, Boswell was forgiven his occassional excesses of the Robinsons or the Earl of Baltimore because he told us about plenty of other players, teams and events.  Indeed, the section that he wrote in this book entitled \\"Five Octobers\\" brings his overall genius to enough light so that it enables the rest of us to see it's still there.  However, for those of us who failed to recognize that Cal Ripken Jr. (or Sr., for that matter) was the Second Coming, this book is a disappointment.  Yes, Ripken is a nice guy and, yes, he was one of the best of his era.  However, the emphasis is on ONE of the best; not THE best.  He's gotten the record, he single-handedly saved Baseball but through that time he was in ONE, count 'em, ONE post season.  Ripken also continued his streak throughout each and every game of the famous 0 for 21 games that the Orioles started the season with in 1988.  Many people, myself included, thought that Ripken should have sat at least one of those games after thestreak got to double digits.  It's called shaking up the team and that's what happened when his own father was fired during the streak.  Obviously the son's \\"streak\\" was more important than the father's job and reputation.  I could go on and on regarding this subject and it usually gets me in trouble.  However, consider the example that Ripken set the record for most consecutive All-Star game selections.  Keep in mind that there was no All-Star game prior to 1933 so some of the very best missed out on this record.  However, does anybody actually believe that Cal Ripken Jr. is the greatest player since 1933?  That is, besides Thomas Boswell.   <br /> <br />Mr. Boswell seems convinced that the rest of us glory in the Oriole's transformation from the worst team in Baseball to almost clinching the division the very next season.  He really talks this up while remaining nonplussed when the Braves and Twins did exactly that a year or so later.  I wish I could find the quote where he bemoans the boredom of watching aging veterans chasing down magic numbers such as 500 home runs, 300 wins, or 3000 hits (not to mention 2130 consecutive games).  His point was, I believe, that the joy in Baseball is not knowing what will happen next rather than keeping tabs on the inevitable.  Still, he does give us some thought-provking essays on Pete Rose and the fall of the commissioner's office. <br /> <br />I guess the point is that we've been spoiled by his previous excellence as a sports reporter with national credentials.  Instead of reading like a reporter for the Washington POST, he reads, in \\"Cracking the Show\\", like the local sports editor for the Baltimore SUN for too much of the time to make this a book worthy of his talents.  Whew!, I'd been holding that in for a long time.	2005-10-10

He has issued a second consecutive collection of his writings composed of a majority of material previously published.  Those of us who have read all of his earlier baseball books and wait in anticipation of his next article can't help but feel taken by this.  He did it in \\"Once More Around the Park\\" and now, again, in \\"Game Time\\".  Once was enough to irritate a loyal following but we were, perhaps, too loyal and purchased enough copies of \\"Once More Around the Park\\" for his publisher to try it again.  What agrivates matters for me is that I have been a subscriber to \\"The New Yorker\\" magazine for a number of years and, therefore, had already read most of the \\"new\\" material.   <br /> <br />Oh well, I guess I have to admit that Angell's writing is so good that I rather enjoyed re-reading some of his essay and articles.  I especially enjoyed re-reading \\"Distance\\" which was about Bob Gibson.  Actually, that essay (about mid-way through the book) got me refocussed enough to read the remainder of \\"Game Time\\" in short order.  The recap of recent seasons was almost like deja vu.  The steam I started off this review with is supplanted by the real pleasure that I felt in reading the last 200 or so pages.  All is forgiven Roger but please store up a bit more new material before you issue another book.	2005-09-21

In \\"Disgrace\\" Coetzee tells the story of a disgraced college professor who learns more about the world he lives in.  His discoveries about life in rural South Africa disillusions him about his country.  His disillusion is the ultimate expression of the book.   <br /> <br />I felt that the story was primarily about the changes in society in South Africa but more so in an allegorical sense than in the specifics Coetzee gave us.  Representing the old ways is the disgraced professor David Lurie.  His disgrace is his lack of a moral compass in his relationship with women.  He displays other traditional values but he is seriously tainted by this one major flaw.  His daughter is a young woman who believes that sacrifice is necessary for the transistion from apartheid an integrated society.  She is willing to go to great lengths to make the necessary sacrifices.  Yet, in doing so, she suffers more than the older generation.  The Black South Africans are determined to go their own way without regard to the standards of the ruling White minority.  Coetzee takes us through the interaction of these three groups to show the difficulty that they face.  We see that there are no easy answers, that right and wrong are relative terms, and that the issues in South Africa involved a lot more than Black and White.  That isn't to suggest that apartheid should not have ended.  I didn't get the feeling that Coetzee was arguing either side.  Instead, I felt he was making us view reality through the eyes of an imperfect, middle-aged, White South African and leaving us uncomfortable with what we saw.	2005-08-24

I have come to look forward to his insight into a very different world. As a youth, I became fascinated with the hidden world of Albania where Stalinism still thrived and the outside world was essentially forbidden.  What secrets were there that were hidden in a 20th Century European country with a discredited form of government and a 19th Century approach to the present.  When the Hoxa government finally fell and a little light creeped into Albania, even weirder things began to emerge.  For a while, the economy of the country was based on pyramid schemes.  Unfortunately, it was the fall of Tito that unleashed the centuries-old hatreds of the region that plunged the Albanians into yet another tenuous existance.  Out of all the newspaper and magazine articles I could get ahold of, nothing gave me the clarity of perspective better than the writings of Ismail Kadare. <br /> <br />\\"Broken April\\" is the grimmest picture of Albania while also seeming to be the most illuminating as well.  This is a portrait of a society in the high plains of Albania where the code of vendettas is so fundamental that its' laws supercede all others.  It is the story of a man trapped by the code and an man and a wife who, as outsiders, become trapped as well.  It is a story of a society that is fueled by death and leaves no one untouched.  In the explanation of the systematic rules and regulations of the \\"Kanun\\" we understand the futility that life must present to these people.  Whether or not this is an allegory to the Hoxa government or an attempt to share the reality of an actual society in the recent past, I cannot say.  For me the story ends with a message that people aren't victims of their society; they ARE their society.  Terror exists only where it is permitted to exist. <br /> <br />I highly recomment \\"Broken April\\" to those who would like a Kafkaesque experience in literature.  For me, Kadare has written another excellentbook but not quite up to his proven potential.	2005-08-10

The problem is; he hasn't written that much (at least that's been translated into English).  My next step was either the epic \\"Soul Mountain\\" or the series of snapshots that comprise \\"Buying a Fishing Rod for My Grandfather\\".  I came across \\"Fishing Rod\\" first and it didn't take me or anyone else much time to stroll though it.   <br /> <br />\\"Buying a Fishing Rod for My Grandfather\\" is a small collection of six short snapshots; scenes that convey an image or emotion that, presumeably, warrents the story's inclusion in this book.  There's a story about an accident that says as much about the bystanders as the people involved.  I read this shortly after driving past the site of a serious accident in Atlanta.  The way everyone had to slow down to see what they could see came to mind as I read the story titled \\"The Accident\\".  Others were good in their own way.  The last story, \\"In an Instant\\", was one I had given up on as a chaotic rambling.  However, I kept with it and it wrapped up quite impressively at the end. <br /> <br />I don't know that I benefited greatly by having read this book but it didn't hurt any and it only took a brief sitting to read through it.	2005-08-09
US	40051756	R34XVZLELJC0DS	0142004693	929452996	The Bounty: The True Story of the Mutiny on the Bounty	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Complete But a Bit Overdone	I have always enjoyed reading about the mutiny on the HMS Bounty.  It is a story that contains so many elements of fascination; the mutiny at sea, the paradise of the South Seas, the unbelievable 3000 mile journey in a crowded life boat, etc.  As a kid, I read the Classics Comic Book versions of the Nordoff and Hall trilogy and I read them over and over.  I collected stamps from Pitcairn Island and I day-dreamed about such an idealic adventure.  I recent years, I toyed with the idea of reading the Nordoff and Hall trilogy but I came across Caroline Alexander's \\"The Bounty\\" and opted for that instead.  I'm glad I did because what I really wanted after all these years was the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  I wasn't expecting to get that from Nordoff and Hall. <br /> <br />Ms. Alexander gets us involved right from the start by appearing to begin at the end and then switching around until she gradually gets into a chronological flow.  I have come to prefer that approach to one where the first 50-100 pages drearily set the background before letting the story begin.  It is clear from the first pages that Ms. Alexander has done a great deal of research and I appreciate that.  My one criticism of her fine book is that she used too much of her research.  Other readers may disagree but I found myself bored to distraction by a mutineer's relative by the name of Nessie Heywood (or is it Hayward?).  Her brother Peter seems to be the focal point of the book which also bothered me somewhat.  I don't mind being introduced to a new (to me) character in the story but I felt he (and, more so, his family) got way too much ink in \\"The Bounty\\".  I am confident that Ms. Alexander could have eliminated as many as 50 pages and come away with a better book.  It seemed that, because there was more available records on some of the characters involved, we should know intimate details about they and their family.  These side trips interfered, in my opinion, with the otherwise fascinating story that Ms. Alexander was otherwise skillfully weaving.   <br /> <br />I came away from \\"The Bounty\\" with a new impression of both Blyth and Christian and new understandings of the probable causes of the mutiny, the power of influence (or is it influence of power) in the course of the events, the whole nature of the Bounty's mission, as well as the settlement of Pitcairn Island.  I gave this book a rating of \\"4\\".  If those 50 pages I mentioned were edited out, it would certainly rate a \\"5\\".  Either way, this book is too good to miss.	2005-08-02

Coetzee.  The first, \\"Waiting for the Barbarians\\" was a novel about societies whereas \\"Youth\\" is a novel about an individual.  I get the strong suspicion that this is an autobiographical novel although I know little, if anything, about the author's life.  However, his subject character's thoughts, actions, and observations are so real and humanly imperfect that I have to feel the book emerges from the authors own memory.  If I'm right, it's all the more reason to praise the talent of Coetzee because he is willing to share the good and the bad about himself.  Even if it isn't autobiographical, it is a masterful disection of the inner soul of an emerging adult writer. <br /> <br />\\"Youth\\" tells the story of a young man of university age who sensed that his future as a writer in his native South Africa is hopeless.  He also realizes that his entire life there is hopeless.  We see the clumsiness of his relationships with others; especially women.  Most of this is his own fault as he sees everything in the context of whether it will help the development of his artistic talent.  Love has no serious role to play in this life (at least at this point in his life).  He emigrates to London (his other options for artistic development were Paris and Vienna).  Unfortunately he has to get a job and his mathmatical background enables him to find a reasonably good one.  However, everything continues to be measured in its' ability to enhance or detract from his development as a poet.  The book ends with the anticipated dispair that such a detached life would bring. <br /> <br />The strength of \\"Youth\\", for me, is the author's ability to bring us such a candid view of an obsessed life and leave us wondering how we would have done things different.  There are many actions and attitudes that we would have definitely handled differently.Yet, the candid reader will see himself committing many of the same errors.  It's hard at 53 to remember just what I would have done 30 years ago without the maturity (hopefully) that comes with age and experience.  Many authors, I believe, make their youthful characters too mature for their age.  Who wants to spend time describing warts when the character is destined for greatness.  Coetzee gives us a dose of immature reality and teaches us about ourselves through the improper and unrealistic expectations of a narcissist.  We learn by wanting to reach out and correct our anti-hero's shortcomings.  We also learn by occassionally seeing ourselves as well.  It was an eye-opening experience for me to read \\"Youth\\".  I'm more anxious than ever to read more of Coetzee.	2005-07-19

Like the previous two I completed; \\"Main Street\\" and \\"Elmer Gantry\\", \\"Kingsblood Royal\\" seems dated but still conveys a very timeless message.  This novel is about a man of prominance in a Northern Minnesota city (I figured it to be a composite of Bemidji and Grand Rapids) who suddenly finds out he is descended from a Negro.  He goes through a transformation of perspective on racial issues.  In time, he declares himself publicly to be a \\"Negro\\".  The effects of this declaration demonstrate the prejudices and ignorances (pardon the redundancy) of the US in the immediate post-WWII years.   <br /> <br />Sinclair Lewis does a compelling job of ferreting out the evils of racial prejudices by showing how one previously accepted man of importance descends to the level of a societal pariah.  Close friends turn away, well-meaning people succumb to pressure and cease their assistance, family members disavow him.  At the same time, we become familiar with the Black residents of Grand Republic who share their trials and tribulations.  I was impressed by how well Lewis covered his subject from so many angles.  In doing so, he challenges the reader to examine where he or she would find themselves among the varied characters in \\"Kingsblood Royal\\" <br /> <br />My complaint about the book is somewhat qualified.  Mr. Kingsblood is 1/32 Negro yet he grabs onto that as his racial identity after living his life unaware of it.  I'm 1/32 Irish but I don't consider myself to therefore be Irish.  It's one thing to discover your long lost father; it's quite another to discover your long lost great great great grandfather.  I suspect that this was what Lewis felt he needed to do to make the story otherwise believable and to point out, as well, how the stereotypes of that period would identify such a small percentage as making no difference in definition.  I'll grant him that privilege given that he wrote such an excellent book.	2005-07-05

I understand that they faced obvious defeat and were able to arrange for a settlement in which they retained \\"autonomy\\" over the lower half of the coutry.  How \\"independent\\" the Vichy France government was and how much they ended up collaberating with the Nazis is a story that much of the rest of the world knows little of.  I understood that the feelings in France were quite divided during the occupation/collaberation.  \\"The Trial of Marshal Petain\\" helps make this even more apparent.   <br /> <br />Jules Roy is the author of this study of the trial of the improbable leader of the Vichy government, Marshal Phillipe Petain.  Roy has the credentials to write this story because he was in the French Army; the one that stayed with France.  He frequently expressed his sense of doubt as to his misplaced loyalties at the time.  In his apparent shame for the outcome of his allegiance, there remains a loyalty for the ultimate authority that Petain represented to him and to millions of other Frenchmen.  How then to judge a man who may have betrayed or may have saved France.   <br /> <br />Roy leads us through each day of the trial interjecting his own thoughts and observations.  At time these asides are extremely helpful while, at other times, they are bewildering.  Roy has two basic faults as the author of \\"The Trial of Marshal Petain\\".  The first is a tendency to assume that the reader knows all of the events that took place during the Vichy government.  For example, there are several references fo the affair in Syria.  As far as I could tell, French aviators had to fight British troops during a military encounter.  I never heard of it before and could have used at least a footnote of explanation.  The second shortcoming is Roy's obsession with Byron.  He quotes excessively from \\"Marino Faliero\\" yet none of his citations conveyed any profundity or relevant addition to the subject at hand.  He tends to get poetic at times to the distraction of the reader.   <br /> <br />I picked up \\"The Trial of Marshal Petain\\" to find out more about the nature of Vichy France.  I succeeded in that search but I'm still looking for more.	2005-06-28

(It was a pretty good movie as well).  It really turned me on to this then-promising young author.  When the sequel, \\"Texasville\\", came out years later, I read that as well.  It turned out to be one of the worst books I have read.  McMurtry's style of writing changed after his heart attack and his writing really suffered since shortly after \\"Lonesome Dove\\" came out.  Still, I found myself continuing to read most every book of his that came out and wanting to be there when the old McMurtry showed up again. <br /> <br />After my experience with \\"Texasville\\", I bought, but was reluctant to read, \\"Duane's Depressed; the sequel to \\"Texasville\\".  As I started out with the book I thought to myself, \\"This is what's wrong with the post-angina McMurtry\\".  The problem is the excessive abundance of boringly idiotic characters.  They're like an influx simplistic and Americanized people out of a Fellini movie.  What made me almost put the book down and quit it is the multitude of Duane's children and grandchildren who are nothing but out of control spoiled brats.  If this was the only book that I encountered these type of  characters, I wouldn't mind.  However, they overflow in all of the modern McMurtry. <br /> <br />As I struggled through a cast of totally disinteresting characters, I reached a point (at about a fourth of the way into the book) where the book really started to take off.  We lose the dysfunctional offspring and start focussing on Duane Moore.  His is a character well-developed by an author that was showing he's still got it.  I found myself drawn into Duane and his life and challenges.  I found myself relating to a man who was facing many things similar to what I was dealing with in my life.  For the duration of the book, I couldn't wait to find out what happened next.  It was a truly endearing study of a man bewildered by his past, present and future.  As Duane wasstruggling with his issues, I found myself wondering if McMurtry was being autobiographical.  I know next to nothing about his private life.  It wasn't until his 14th or 15th book that a picture of him was shown on any dust jacket and that's the same picture that has appeared on every book since.  Maybe it's an analogy of how his life changed after his heart attack.  Whatever it was, the character of Duane takes me back to the early talent of Larry McMurtry. <br /> <br />This is a very good book that just happens to start out poorly.  It isn't up there with \\"The Last Picture Show\\", \\"Lonesome Dove\\", \\"Leaving Cheyenne\\", or \\"Horseman Pass By\\".  However, it IS in the category of \\"Moving On\\", \\"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers\\", \\"Terms of Endearment\\" and several others.  When McMurtry's good he is VERY good but when he is bad...     <br /> <br />	2005-05-19

Naipaul and I am quite impressed with the man's talent as an author.  \\"Half a Life\\" for me was the author's focus on being of a race and caste that does not fit in his social surroundings.  The story begins with his father who purposely chose to marry a woman below his caste in the caste-conscious India of the 1930's and 40's.  As a young man, Willie Chandran journeys to London on a schorlarship.  He associates with a Jamaican man who is involved in an inter-racial relationship with a white woman.  He moves on to other peoples of other races and/or mixed race.  He follows a woman to a Portuguese Central African colony where he (as well as we, the readers) encounters other racial groups.  All through the book we seem to see life on the basis of people in their social strata and their resulting relationship with others.  By and large, the encouraging message in the book is that most people get along fine.  However, there always seem to be an undertone that some groups will not mix and little, if anything, can be done to change that.  I'm not sure that Naipaul meant to come to a conclusion but that he meant instead to give us a look through his eyes of a world that is largely focussed on race and social standing.   <br /> <br />In \\"Half a Life', Naipaul's narrator is a sort of detached individual who never gets to closely attached to anyone.  He has friends but they seem to come and go easily without any major impact on him.  Part of this is the meaning of the title, \\"Half a Life\\".  He never really \\"finds\\" himself in this world of racial mixes and racial mixers.  That, presumably, is the reason for his detachment.  He couldn't even feel like he fit in in his own family due to the caste distinctions between his own parents.  I believe he chose the Portuguese African colony setting in order to let the guerilla insurgents battle against the Portuguese colonialists highlight the ongoing struggle of different peoples of different backgrounds.  I realize that there is an issue of nationalism and other things as well.  However, the setting for a good half of the book helped bring the meaning to greater light. <br /> <br />I guess the review should not be longer than the book itself.  \\"Half a Life\\" is a mere 211 pages in a small book format.  It is absorbing in its' style and I believe most people with take something meaningful from it.  I know I did and I know I'm looking forward to reading more by V. S. Naipaul.	2005-05-05

I can believe that many a reader gave up on this book because of the repetitious, meandering, and confusing first two thirds of the story.  I kept wondering why I didn't just put the book down and leave it because I was getting next to nothing out of it.  There were a lot of different characters and brief accounts of a moment in their lives.  Many of these were rather earthly events but we kept revisiting them albeit with an occassional expanded (or is it expended) insight.  There was no coherance and, for my part, there wasn't even a clue who was narrating at any given time.  Some events were recounted at least a dozen times with the only advantage being that we were starting to become more familiar with the names of the different characters.  Although I came to appreciate why the author chose this technique, I think it put too much responsibility on the reader to sort things out.  I believe Cela could have done a better job of bringing his ideas to life.   <br /> <br />Finally, at the two thirds point in the book, we get a narration that we can follow and the various characters and events are woven into a story.  The writing becomes impressive and I found myself underlining phrases such as, \\"Faith is the corkscrew of conscience\\" and \\"When life dies, death is born\\".  Cela gives us a perspective of the effects of the Spanish Civil War and that was the reason I chose to read the book in the first place.  Cela paints a picture of the dispair born of man's outrage against his fellow man.  Man is both the protaganist and the victim and it is joy the is the biggest casualty.   <br /> <br />The effects of the fraternal civil war has taken the joy out of life.  That is, I believe, what Cela meant with his meandering beginning.  The many recollections were of people who represented the past when life enjoyable.  We are reminded of theirdemise as though it were a  bookmark for the beginning of dispair.  The theme expands to explain the title; the death of Lionheart was mourned as the primary bookmark of the beginning and the revengeful murder of his assassin bookmarks the end.  Each was celebrated with the same mazurka that was played for no one else.  The end of hostilities does not invite the return of the joy of life.  Too much damage was done, too many memories were etched in stone.  Life for the contempories of the Spanish Civil War would never again be the same.	2005-05-01

I took time out to read this small, illustrated, 51-page book.  I wasn't paying attention to anything but the price and the author when I ordered it.  I guess Jose Saramago isn't in the habit of writing short stories otherwise his publisher could just as easily have waited to include it in his next collection. <br /> <br />The story, as I understood it, is that of a man who is searching for a new start, a new world.  He doesn't seem to express any objections to his present world, he just wants a boat so he can go find an unknown island.  If I try to tell too much more of the plot, I'll run the risk of this review being longer than the \\"book\\".  In the end, I understood the plot to mean that often it is the journey, rather than the destination that matters.  The determination is greater than the result. <br /> <br />This is a nice enough story but it doesn't warrent its' own issuance.  I mean, it isn't THAT good.  I'll read more of Saramago and I'll be glad to sing his praises many times, I'm sure.  I'll just pay a little more attention to what I'm ordering in the future.	2005-04-12

It is told by a man who tells the story of a cattle drive he was on in the early 1880's.  From Southern Texas to Northern Montana, we get an inside look at all of the drudgery and excitement he experienced.  We gets vivid descriptions of a stampede, trips into Dodge City and other frontier towns along the way, stories around the campfire, crossing rivers, deserts, as well as a gunfight.  The power of this book is Andy Adams' ability to put us right along side him as all of the events are recreated.  His enthusiasm for and knowledge of the job of a cowboy gives a Western enthusiast everything he or she'd want to know.  I found myself captivated by nearly every chapter.  I don't have any complaints about the book except that the attitudes of the 1880's don't always fit in neatly with the political correctness of the present.  Read the book and you'll find out what I mean and you'll also enjoy a very good look at an important chapter of American history.	2005-04-06

Most Americans are aware of what WE did to Japanese Americans after 12/7/41.  There are similarities with how we look at Arab Americans after 9/11/01.  There are a number of things that make the treatment of Japanese Americans more egregious such as the absence of similar segregation of German and Italian Americans.  There would certainly seem to be obvious racial overtones to this although, in fairness to a supposed \\"other point of view\\", we were not so directly attacked by the Germans or Italians.   <br /> <br />\\"The Children of Topaz\\" is a short book that arose from a diary of an elementary class at the Japanese American internment camp in Utah known as Topaz.  The diary itself would barely fill a page or two.  The book is comprised mostly of the Introduction, Afterward, and the supplemental information that embelishes each day's diary entries.  This supplement comes in very handy.  For example, there is an entry for 4/14/43 that reads, \\"...an old man, Mr. James H. Wakasa passed away.\\"  The author's supplement lets us know that Mr. Wakasa was shot by a camp guard and decribes suspicious circumstances.  Much information was thus shared about this otherwise \\"insignificant\\" entry.  There are many other such supplements all of which are longer that the diary entries they describe.  There was one entry that I thought was quietly brushed aside; April 20, 1943 \\"Today is Hitler's birthday\\".  Possibly just an innocent observation but I didn't think the authors gave it an unbiased evaluation.  Yet that is OK for me because this book is about what the victims of this injustice went through.  The \\"3\\" rating is because there wasn't anything that I would consider to be great or outstanding in this book.  It is helpful but if you want a truly compelling story about the internment from a child's view, read the book \\"Obasan\\".	2005-03-28

Some years ago, when I couldn't figure out what to read next, I thought I would try out Nobel Prize winning novelists.  I have had the opportunity to encounter many excellent authors to whom I would never have been exposed to otherwise.  There are a few that have been quite difficult for which to locate any available books in English.  Earlier this year I was finally able to find books by Bjornsterne Bjornson.  I found that odd because I have lived almost all my adult life in Norwegian-American communities and Bjornson was the first Norwegian to win the Nobel Prize for Literature (doing so in 1903).  I looked up the info on the available titles and it appeared that \\"Arne\\" had the best recommendations.  It is a good enough book but it gave me no reason to understand why Bjornson won the award considering that Mark Twain was still alive as well as Bjornson's own countryman; Henrik Ibsen.  I suppose that the Swedish Academy probably had a Scandanavian bias from the start.   <br /> <br />\\"Arne\\" is the story of a young man growing up in rural Norway.  His father was something of a rascal and dominates the first third of the book.  Arne learns to read and consumes all of the books he can as a youth.  He has big dreams but...  No need to tell the whole story.  The book was fairly commonplace but it does end with a nice twist that came completely unexpected.  It saved the book from mediocrity in my opinion.   <br /> <br />There may be a fair amount of local color for those interested in such things.  I have greatly appreciated that aspect in such other Nobelists as Grazia de Ladda and Luigi Pirandello.  Bjornson does not approach these authors in my opinion (based solely on \\"Arne\\").  I will probably give Bjornson another try but I'm not in any big hurry. <br />	2005-03-02

I have the whole series but let them sit on my shelf for years until I discovered Catton's genius for communicating history while reading \\"Glory Road\\".  Some historical books are written by persons adept at research but short on writing skills.  Others are adept at writing but short on research skills.  A good book is when you find someone good at both.  Catton EXCELS at both.  His ability to show us the Civil War through the eyes of the participants is quite impressive.  It's even more impressive when realizing that he takes us across a lot of ground in a mere 339 pages yet never lets us feel that we missed anything nor that we were bogged down in anything.  He gives us his philosophy yet seems to try and give us enough leeway to decide for ourselves on a number of issues such as the merits of McClellan as commanding general.  <br /> <br />\\"Mr. Lincoln's Army\\" covers the war from post First Bull Run with emphasis on the Penninsula Campaign and Antietam.  Along the way we get a lot of insight into the politics that had many a politican exasperated with McClellan while the majority of soldiers worshipped him.  As we explore the book, we frequently come across many a sideline subject.  For example, he covers in this vollume the food that the common soldier had to eat.  It was surprizing how thorough he covered the subject in far fewer pages that I encountered in other books. <br /> <br />I've read plenty of fiction that wasn't written as well as Catton writes.  Given the fascinating subject matter, this book was a pleasure to read.  I can't wait to read \\"A Stillness at Appomattox\\".	2005-02-27

This is an interesting book that gives us a series of stories about Sioux spirituality.  The stories are loosely interconnected with each other and tell of people who maintain an ability to employ a sort of black magic.  With this \\"gift\\" they communicate with past generations, conjure up love potions, compel others to self destruction, and other bizarre phenomena.  Within these stories is a generally clear view of life in a modern day Indian reservation.  The author, an enrolled member of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation who grew up in Chicago, gives an inside view of a live fairly removed from mainstream America.  I got the feeling that there was a fair amount of autobiographical material included in these stories.   <br /> <br />I was prepared to give this book a \\"3 Star\\" rating until I noticed how well the author pulled things together towards the end.  I had made the mistake of reading the book one story at a time spaced in between my other reading.  I finished the last third of the book in a day's time and was able to catch the inter-relationships of the stories.  Still, I was not as drawn into the spiritual magic as others may be.  I don't discredit this phenomena but I suspect there are others who will get more out of the book than I did.  I did enjoy a lot of the local flavor.  I don't ever recall seeing any other novel that mentioned my wife's hometown of Mandaree, North Dakota.  I have come to appreciate that there is a real element of spiritual magic through her Hidatsa/Mandan roots.  Of the many stories and incidents that she has shared with me, I do vividly recall the night after her mother's funeral.  My wife expressed her aprehension about going to bed that night because she was sure her mother's spirit would come to visit.  That night, about 2AM, our house dog started barking.  He never barks indoors at night and, when I got up to look around, nothing explained his outburst.  I was puzzled, my wife wasn't.  Susan Powers shares a lot of this in \\"The Grass Dancer\\" but on a much larger scale.	2005-01-19

I must admit that I began asking myself what the point of the story was through the first two thirds of the book.  Waugh has an enjoyable style of writing that has carried me through others of his books.  I remember thinking what a wonderful book \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" was after I finished it.  However, to this day I'm not sure why the author wrote it.  Evelyn Waugh has a reputation as a humorist but that, for me, is misleading.  I can see his satire and spoofing of the upper class and there is much of that in \\"Officers and Gentlemen\\".  However, Waugh is no Mark Twain.  My favorite book by Waugh is \\"A Handful of Dust\\" which touched me very deeply.  Reading that this, too, is a work of humor (as well as tragedy) confuses me.<br /><br />\\"Officers and Gentlemen\\", as I mentioned, starts out slowly but reaches a point of real insight when the men of Hookforce enter the reality of war.  The theater of war is Crete and the personalized images of war were, for me, the real value of the book.  I realized that the first two thirds was to acquaint us with the different characters so we were better able to see the effects that war had on them.  Along the way we do get a lot of \\"humorous\\" satire on the military and its bureacracy.  One scene has the main Character, Guy, contemplating all that he has witnessed and experienced.  His deep thoughts end when called for cocktails.<br /><br />This is the sixth book by Evelyn Waugh that I have read.  I'll read more because he writes well.  I mentioned that ther are times that I wondered what his point was in writing a particular book.  However, there are also times, such as I experienced in \\"Officers and Gentlemen\\" where I am very glad that I read the book.	2005-01-17

I didn't live here then but I have come to appreciate him as a home town hero.  In North Dakota, anyone who goes on to fame in the greater world is a hero to all of the state.  During his Chicago tenure, the entire state was one big Bulls fan club.  However, I was one of a number of people who wished Jackson well but didn't exactly become endeared to the LA Lakers when he took that coaching job.  Controversy for the Bulls was Scottie Pippin sitting out the final shot of the game or Dennis Rodman's galaxy of hair colors and designs.  The Kobie Bryant/Shaquille O'Neal feud, the rape trial, the glitter of Hollywood were all distractions that turned a lot of fans off, myself included.  However, with the perceptive insight of Phil Jackson, all of this makes for a great book. <br /> <br />This is the chronicle of the 2003-2004 season; the year that the Lakers were supposed to walk away with the title after a season that saw them fall short.  The addition of two future hall-of-famers to go along with the other two already on the team made it seem like a \\"can't miss\\" opportunity.  Jackson analyzes the season in a journal format.  Although he probably rewrote some of his earlier notes, the journal procedes without any hint at what will or won't happen later on.  There are many personalities that are presented and discussed in this book.  Jackson seems to elaborate only when necessary but don't worry, with this team it's often necessary to elaborate on incidents and personalities.  There isn't any \\"dirt\\" as far as I'm concerned.  It's more along the lines of spoiled, pampered athletes and their picadillos.  We get some interesting quips and stories from his Chicago days and even a few items that go back to his North Dakota days.  However, the day by day focus is the ups and downs of the Lakers.  There is a lot of excellent analysis of basketball strategy especially as to how it aided or hindered the previous night's outcome.  There were many different things going on throughout the season and Jackson seems ready to discuss whatever seems relevant.  In the end, they still lose to the Pistons and he still ends up out of a coaching job.  However, we know a lot more than what we did before we read the book.   <br /> <br />There is a lot in this book for a variety of readers.  Basketball fans will appreciate the strategy and history that Jackson shares.  Bulls fans with enjoy hearing a few stories about the glory years, and Lakers fans, of course, will get plenty of enjoyable insight.   <br /> <br />Jackson has had a very successful career as a coach in the NBA.  He earned his right to be there from his old days in the CBA.  Some might point out that he always happened to coach teams with top level players but they may be forgetting that those same players weren't champions until he was their coach.  Phil Jackson was always a bit different from the generic jock-turned coach.  His willingness to explore different concepts in basketball, methods of concentration, and interpersonal skills helped make him a coach capable of blending diverse personalities into a team.  However, there is a limit to everything as we all discover in \\"The Last Season\\".	2005-01-11

It is a marvelous format that works like a sort of \\"Day by Day\\" series of inspiring and/or compelling theological thoughts.  Rather than follow a litergical order of verses, Norris uses different words and terms associated with Christianity to fuel her observations.  I honestly was expecting a sort of academic treatise on what various terms meant.  What I got instead was an illustration of the essence of the meaning of various aspects and perspectives of Christianity.  From the very beginning I was inspired by what Ms. Norris was sharing.  She has observed a lot through her years and has a remarkable ability to recall those observations into illuminating stories.<br /><br />Part of the impression this book made upon me may have had something to do with the fact that I started reading it towards the end of a retreat I was on.  It was at the Benedictine Convent and Abbey where Ms. Norris spent much of her time.  I hadn't even considered the connection when I took the book along but I was quickly in tune with her comments about her experiences with the Benedictine nuns and monks.  Part of the appeal of her book to me had to have something to do with so many events taking place in locales I am familiar with.  However, the broader appeal of the book lies in her sincere devotion to the Benedictine Way while equally active in the main stream Protestant Church.  She seems intent on exploring ways to find a closer and clearer meaning to her faith.  Like Ms. Norris, I had experienced years apart from religion before returning to it with a sincere intention to become a \\"Good Christian\\".  However, I needed to first understand what it is that comprises a \\"Good Christian\\".  Kathleen Norris spoke to me in the voice of experience of someone who has gone quite a bit further than I.  I say that even though my journey has led me to ordination as an Episcopal Priest.  Ms. Norris shares a lot of her experiences as a somewhat reluctant lay minister in the Presyterian Church.  I am satified that she has found her vocation.<br /><br />Ms. Norris is a Poet in the literal sense because it is her real profession.  I'm not one for poetry but I have always enjoyed the rare author who can write prose and leave the impression that one has read poetry.  Her book, \\"Dakota\\" is a masterpiece of that style as is \\"Amazing Grace\\".  I confess that I was not as drawn into her book, \\"The Cloister Walk\\".  I think that is why I was a bit shy about starting \\"Amazing Grace\\".  However, I am very greatful that I took it on that retreat.  I would recommend this book to anyone who aspires to know more about the Christian faith.  Those even mildly interested will find a voice that speaks in a clear, compelling and informative manner.

I mention this because the first one has a plot but I'm not sure that \\"The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis\\" has one.  After reading this novel, I'm not sure that I care.  There isn't much action in this book.  Its' strength is in its' character development and their relationships with each other.  One of the characters is a sort of ghost, another a maid, and yet another a young disabled woman.  The title character has returned from Brazil to Portugal after an absence of about 16 years.  He has come home to pay his respects to an old friend; the poet Fernando Pessoa who recently passed away.  (I am of the impression that this is a real-life person from Portugese literary history).  Dr. Reis doesn't seem to know what he wants to do with the remainder of his life.  He develops an infatuation with the young disabled woman and this becomes his focus.  Actually, the more I try to explain the \\"plot\\" the more meaningless it seems.  Throughout the novel, there are thoughts and conversations that give us a lot of deep insights to a variety of things.  If this doesn't sound like a reason to read this book, don't waste your time.  If you are at least a little bit interested, bear in mind that Jose Saramago is a very gifted writer and this is considered by many to be his best book.  It's worth the time to pick this up and judge for yourself.   <br /> <br />Saramago doesn't believe in quotation marks and he likes long sentences and paragraphs.  However, it's surprizing how this doesn't confuse the reader nor slow down the book.  People would be talking back and forth with each other and I had no trouble following the dialogue.   <br /> <br />There is a bit of history in this book.  Dr. Reis reads the paper daily and Saramago allows us to follow the developments in Europe in 1936; Ethiopia, Nazi Germany, and the developing civil war in Spain.  For those especially interested in the Spanish Civil War, this book may bequite interesting (so long as you aren't looking for a plot).   <br /> <br />The other work by Saramago that I read was \\"All the Names\\".  That book had a rather futuresque plot and lots of possible interpretations.  I will concede that, in my interest in reading \\"The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis\\", I may have missed some key interpretations of the author's intended message.  There was a heavy emphasis on Portugese poetry and this may have been Saramago's toast to the poets of his country's recent past.  Personally, I came away with a bleak look at a life that had lost its' purpose and an individual who lost interest in finding a new one.	2004-11-24

We all need help from time to time to redirect our focus when we seem stuck on finding the right message to share.  I like the way the collective authors of \\"New Proclamation\\" give several directions that our minds might care to follow.  They do so without a doctrinaire attitude that closes doors instead of opening them.  I will have to state that I found their previous edition to be a bit more helpful.  There were a few times I turned to this edition only to come aware just as stuck as when I consulted it.  However, it generally follows the same format and gives a person a good overall view of the theme of the day as well as a synopsis of the readings.  I recommend it to anyone in the ministry who isn't afraid to listen to other thoughts before finalizing their own.	2004-11-19

It reflects, favorably for me, the style of scholarly writing of the times.  Mr. James, who has written of other men and events of Houston's era, writes in a manor that suggests an almost intimate knowledge of his subject.  He often shares Houston's feelings and reactions which he probably picked up on through his research into his subject's personal papers.  As a result, the reader is more apt to become more emotionally involved with General Houston as he or she reads \\"The Raven\\".  This became somewhat of a problem for me because Sam Houston is a somewhat exasperating individual.   <br /> <br />The Sam Houston that emerged, for me, in \\"The Raven\\" was a man of strong leadership abilities, solid loyalties, and minimal political thought.  I say this last part reluctantly because Marquis James provides information that suggests that he was a very capable governor.  However, there seem to be few issues that come up during Houston's various tenures in the US House and Senate.  There were the issues of Texas, the Union, and his close friends; the Chreokees.  There is little, if anything, on Houston's opinions concerning the National Bank, trade issues, interstate commerce or other important subjects of the day.  Indeed, we get images of a bored Senator Houston whittling away (literally) his time in the US Senate.  There is, however, plenty about Houston the leader whether it be on the field of battle or the state house.  He was and remains a most impressive figure in the history of the United States of America.  Much of what I had heard about the man was fleshed out in \\"The Raven\\" in a satisfactory manner. <br /> <br />The major events are dealt with appropriately.  For example, we don't get half of the book devoted to the Battle of San Jacinto.  In fact, we get only a brief message of the Alamo but enough of San Jacinto to know what happened and how it affected both Houstan andTexas.  Indeed, the greatest attention seems to have been given to Houston's failed first marriage.  It ended with neither party talking about the cause of the split.  The author seemed intent on uncovering the real cause and had us revisiting his first wife periodically through her life after Houston.   <br /> <br />Marquis James did have an interesting mystery that he introduced to us early in the book.  It had to do with a gift from Houston's mother to him when he was young.  I had forgotten all about it until it showed up again at the end of the book; an appropriate message at an appropriate place.   <br /> <br />I learned a lot about Sam Houston from reading this book and I am glad I did.  There is plenty of Texas in here as there should be.  There is also plenty of Tennessee, Washington DC, Andrew Jackson, Santa Ana, Cherokee Indians, and, as I alluded to early, the first Mrs. Houston (the second Mrs. Houston seemed to exist solely for producing offspring and writing letters).  If Sam Houston is your hero, this is your book.  If not then this is still an excellent biography.	2004-11-02

Why should Margaret Atwood be an exception?  Her \\"Good Bones and Simple Murders\\" is a short collection of idle thoughts and simple sketches.  In all fairness, much of what is in here are complex ideas put into the briefest of scenarios and many will appreciate what the author is trying to say.  The problem for Atwood fans is that they know her talent lies is how well she weaves her ideas over the course of a novel.  She doesn't just hit you with an idea or perspective; she totally draws you into it and leaves you fully comfortable with it.  Therefore, her short snippets seem banal.  Still there are a number of enjoyable items in \\"Good Bones and Simple Murders\\".  My favorite is \\"Let us Now Praise Stupid Women\\".  I laughed at a number of the satires about men as well.  I think feminist will likely over-rate this book.  But then, they might not be alone.  For myself, I lament that this excercise may have only served to delay her next novel.	2004-10-30

Kelly	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A Hunter's Paradise	\\"Yellowstone Kelly\\" is an autobiographical account of the life of a trapper and scout in the Dakota and Montana territory in the 25 years after the Civil War.  It is well written (with the help of M. M. Quaife) and is easily read.  For those who live in the Dakotas, Montana, Wyoming, and, to a lesser extent, Colorado, this book might be more appealing.  It offers a glimpse at life in this area over 100 years ago and many a name or landmark little known to others will catch your attention.  For example, as one who lives in NW North Dakota, I found it interesting to discover who Red Mike was (there's a golf course nearby with that name).  For people who enjoy hunting, there are many pages of the hunting excursions that Kelly frequently took in the area.  For people who enjoy the history of the American West, there are accounts of some of the lesser battles in the area's history.   <br /> <br />The book, copyrighted in 1926, is the recollections of Kelly at a time when there were not many of his type still around.  I would have liked to have read more about his later life but I got the impression that he stopped his tale at the point when civiliztion finally took control.  I guessed that a man like him would have eventually gone to Alaska and, wouldn't you know, that was one of the few things he said about his later life.   <br /> <br />Of the many interesting chapters, the one that might impress the general reader the most is his account of a trip to the Yellowstone Park in the late 1870's.  Amidst his tale of the grandeur of the area, we also read about an encounter with hostile Indians.  This was not the sort of travel log we're used to reading these days.  The only fault that the book seems to have is its' brevity.  However, what it does cover is worth the little time it takes to read it.	2004-10-08
US	40051756	R39IU2AI697GFH	0877971749	103526998	The Maid Silja	Books	3	13	14	N	Y	Not the equal of "People in the Summer Night"	I'm just not sure what to make of this book.  After reading \\"People in the Summer Night\\" a number of years ago, I have been looking long and hard for another book by Frans Sillanpaa.  I was very elated to be able to find this one on Amazon.com and looked forward to reading it.  However, it was not the stirring novel that the other one was. <br /> <br />Part of the problem with \\"The Maid Silja\\" is that it is hard to get a good grasp on the purpose of the novel.  The author essentitally says he is telling us about the last member of a long family tree.  We get a brief glimpse of the first of three generations, a longer look at the second, and about half of the book is dedicated to the third generation; Silja.  There are many passages in the book that flow along very well but then seem to look for a reason to switch gears.  There is a fascinating look at the son of a fairly well-to-do farmer who marries below his station.  The way his in-laws gradually drag him under is well told and may be especially interesting to those who \\"can relate\\".  The transition of Silja from a young girl to a working girl is also touchingly rendered.  The beauty of a father's love; often implied but seldom expressed, is well written.  Somehow, as I moved along in the book, I kept wondering why things had to change.  The departure of Silja from the professor's home was something I was never able to fully understand.  Yet the scene of her return was probably worth the whole book.  It was a \\"You can't go home again\\" scenario with the added proviso; \\"Not even for a day\\".  After getting an interesting glimpse of the politics of Finland in what I presumed to be the 1920's, the end draws near.  What puzzled me at the end was the message that the author left us with in a mere paragraph.  It was an excellent message but I didn't think that the book had served as a laboratory that proved the theory.  In others words, the book didn't seem to illustrate what the author's point was at the end.   <br /> <br />Some years ago I saw a brief trivia questionaire about the Nobel Prize for Literature.  The question I remembered was, \\"Was the Nobel Prize for Literature ever awarded for purely political reasons?\\".  The answer was \\"Yes\\" and that it happened in 1939 when the Academy was so incensed over the Soviet Union's invasion of little old Finland that it awarded the prize to a run of the mill Finnish writer named Frans Sillanpaa.  I was incensed when I read that because, after having read \\"People in the Summer Night\\", I was convinced that Sillanpaa possessed a genius for writing.  After reading \\"The Maid Silja\\", I'm rethinking that opinion.	2004-10-05
US	40051756	R3QU2WHJT40VON	0385303327	25497174	Alternate Oscars	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Brilliant Idea with Great Alternate Suggestions	Have you ever watched an older movie and enjoyed it so much that you looked it up to see how many Oscars it won?  How many times did you come away wondering why it wasn't even nominated for a single one?  What makes a great movie great, what makes an over-rated movie over-rated, and what movies over the years have been most egregiously overlooked?  \\"Alternate Oscars\\" is a book that explores these questions in a most enjoyable and enlightening way.   <br /> <br />The author, Danny Peary, looked over the films of 1927 (the first year of the Academy Awards) through 1991 (the year he put the book together) and gave us his thoughts on who the real Academy Award winners should have been.  He limited his choices to the awards for Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Actress and many of the alternate award winners he came up with I whole heartedly agreed with.  Mind you, Peary enthusiastically agrees with some of the Oscars awarded over the years and he discards some classic movies in favor of some obscure ones.  He meets his critics head on because he writes an essay explaining each of his choices.   <br /> <br />The format lists the original winner and other nominees followed by Peary's choice for winner and others that he felt worthy of nomination.  The author gives himself the freedom of having one or two other nominees or seven to eight other nominees if he felt they were worthy.  I the case of 1963, Peary determined that there was no winner for Best Picture because there was none worthy even of his nomination.  One of the reasons that I enjoyed this book is because I had seen enough of Peary's more obscure choices to know that he was right on the money.  For example, he cites with nominations for best actor, James Cagney in \\"One, Two, Three\\", Groucho Marx in \\"Duck Soup\\", and (as a co-winner for 1951) Alastair Sim in \\"A Christmas Carol\\".  I was bothered by some of the great movies that he eliminated from competition but I was also pleased to see some greatly over-rated movies take the fall. <br /> <br />I enjoy good movies just like I enjoy good books.  There are far too many books out there for me to read in my brief lifetime.  Therefore I do my best to understand what are the better reliable sources for me to find the books I'm more apt to enjoy.  Likewise with movies, I don't have time to watch everything that's shown on Turner Classic Movies nor, I've found, would I really enjoy most of them if I did.  I have found several good guides for what movies are probably worth taking the time to see.  I gave this book 5 stars because, from what movies I'm already familiar with, Danny Peary seems to be able to pick 'em.	2004-10-01

The four volumes of the set are chronologically titled \\"Autumn\\", \\"Winter\\", \\"Spring\\", and \\"Summer\\".  \\"Autumn\\" was a book I found in a Denver used book store a few years ago.  They only had two of the other three volumes so I decided to just get the first one at the time.  I finally read \\"Autumn\\" when I had an opportunity to return to Denver.  The book was very good but, alas, that used book store is no more.  That's too bad because I am anxious to see how things proceed with the family that \\"Autumn\\" acquainted me with.   <br /> <br />This book appears to portray a realistic view of the Polish rural peasant society at a time roughly 100 years ago.  There are a number of characters of varying castes who interact with one another.  The focal point of this volume is a May/September marriage between a reasonably large farm owner and a young maiden from a poor family.  The descriptions of the engagement, wedding, and seemingly endless celebration are quite enjoyable.   <br /> <br />One rather disturbing aspect of the book is the rampent anti-Semiticism.  The Jewish characters in the book are referred to in many various deragetory ways.  It may help explain why the English version of the book is so hard to come by.  This sort of thing may well be indicative of the time and place but it is politically incorrect nowadays.  Whether that is right or wrong is not my point.  In all fairness, the many Jewish/Yiddish accounts of that time and place that I have read (in English) convey a similar disdain for the Gentiles.  In writing of Poland of a century ago, it would be erasing history to try to pretend that there wasn't such a conflict between the two cultures.   <br /> <br />Reymont won the Nobel Prize for Literature on the strength of this epic novel.  If you can get a hold of it, don't pass it up; even if it's only one volume.	2004-09-20

I found the book to be very easy and enjoyable reading and I look forward to reading more by this author.  The problem for me with \\"The Lowenskold Ring\\" (a/k/a \\"The General's Ring\\") is that it was too brief.  The author was able to mix some of the folk culture of rural Sweden of roughly 150 years ago with some morality lessons.  The morality lessons tended to deal with greed, pride, and loyalty and they were well enough presented.  However, I had the feeling that author squandered an opportunity to say more.  Like a journey in which the main character encounters many different types of people, \\"Lowenskold's Ring\\" could have been a vehicle to give us several more personalities and issues to confront.   <br /> <br />I also felt that the language of the author was written for either a younger or less enlightened audience.  I can see where the author would do well with children's stories.  However, I will end by saying that the book served as an enjoyable activity for the hour or so that it took to read.	2004-09-07

I had anticipated an in-depth, inside look at life in Communist China.  I got that but not in the manner I had come to expect.  Xingjian portrays a society that was certainly a repressive one but yet one in which evolving standards enabled the hero to be both victim and active participant.  The book weaves itself around in time so that, for the first two thirds of the book, the chapters go back and forth between past and present.  This has the effect of letting us know that the hero survives whatever crisis he faces as we go along.  While this minimizes some otherwise suspenseful moments, it also enhances our interest in other subjects.  For example, we learn very early in the book about the hero's failed marriage but we never find out anything more about the particulars until the last third of the book.   <br /> <br />This book certainly appears to be autobiographical fiction and we see our hero, Xingjian, develop as an artist and find his own personal freedom in his art.  Yet he often has to hide or destroy the very things that give meaning to his life lest he seem \\"different\\" from the standard.  We follow the development of Red China through to the near present when relaxed repression alows persons like Xingjian to emmigrate. <br /> <br />The person that Xingjian has become is not a very likeable one.  He is focussed solely on himself.  His relationships with women, and there are many of these, seem to center almost exclusively on sex.  His marriage that failed was apparently not his fault but he seemed determined never to commit himself to anyone else after that.  I found myself engrossed in his story but not in himself.  As I reflected on this, I came to the understanding that Xingjian had a lifetime struggle to avoid becoming just another one of the masses.  In struggling to maintain his individuality he seems to have succeeded too well.  Perhaps this is the greatest statement he was able to make about the evils of a communist society.	2004-08-21

The cause of their inner turmoil comes from a variety of sources but their emptiness and incompleteness is very real.  Shusaku Endo introduces us to each of them seperately and then has them all, for seperate reasons, journey to India.  They are in a guided tour that will supposedly show them a number of Buddhist shrines and historical sites.  Their trip leads them to the Ganges River where they initially off at and then are all drawn to its' sacredness.  The author gives us a serene glimpse of a sort of peace descending upon the 5 pilgrims.  It may not be the peace they sought or would recognize, but it seems to be the peace they needed. <br /> <br />Shusaku Endo is a Japanese Christian who writes challengely about his own faith.  To me, the core of his message in \\"Deep River\\" is the universal nature of faith and the universal nature of God.  He exists for all of us but we come to know Him through the religion of our culture.  Thus the Hindus, Christians, Moslems, Buddhists, etc are all seeking the same ultimate oneness with God (i.e.; peace) but they are each traveling different paths outlined through them in a theology passed along through the millennia.  To illustrate his point, Endu shows us the five seperate tales of redemption and has them all come to salvation at a Hindu holy site.  God DOES work in mysterious ways.	2004-08-19

I admit that, despite the mere 238 pages, I was put off by the pages-long paragraphs.  Saramago has his own way of putting his words together and, as I found out, he doesn't use quotation marks.  However, once I started reading the book, I became at ease with these peculiarities and found his style rather easy to follow. <br /> <br />This is a book about a lot of things and I suspect many more than I picked up on.  For me the theme was the anonymity of people in todays society.  We focus our attention on the celebrities of the world at the expense of the lonely person down the street.  The main character in \\"All the Names\\", Senhor Jose, is a man who works in a large government office.  His job is to assist is keeping track of the vital statistics of the people, past and present, of his political division.  The book and character reminded me a lot of Ismail Kadare's \\"The Palace of Dreams\\".  As in that book, the main character goes against the grain and discovers things in the process.  His passion is collecting information about celebreties.  In the process of looking over his clippings, he realized that he had obtained an information card about some common, unknown citizen.  He began to wonder just who this person is and that curiosity evolved into a compulsion.  His clandestine investigation serves as the bulk of the story.  His curiosity about an unknown fellow citizen makes a mystery out of the seemingly commonplace.  Therein was the crux of the story as I understood it; we are surrounded by people who all have an interesting story to their lives.  However, we bury the multitudes in favor of the rare person of fame.  In doing so, we not only grossly overrate the lives of the famous, we end up trivializing our own lives as well. <br /> <br />That's my take on \\"All the Names\\" but I could tell that there were many other directions in which this short novel could be interpreted.  Saramago's style, peculiarities aside, reminds me a lot of one of my favorite authors; B Traven.  Obviously, I will be reading a lot more of Jose Saramago.	2004-08-18
US	40051756	R3VZZGMANCTBNM	0156007258	357119457	One Man's Justice	Books	4	9	9	N	Y	life on the run	Over the years, I have made an effort to try and read books that give me perspective of \\"the other side\\".  Since I have had such a compelling interest in WWII, this has led me to try German and Japanese authors who can relate what it was like from their perspective.  Often, I was disappointed in what I read; too much of it seemed \\"cleansed\\" or overly self-critical.  In Akira Yoshimura's \\"One Man's Justice\\", I believe that I have gotten the type of perspective that I have been looking for.  In finding that perspective I found myself uncomfortable, at times, with this book.   <br /> <br />The gist of the story is that of a lower level Japanese officer who actively took part in the execution of US airmen prisoners of war towards the end of WWII.  After the war comes to a surprizingly abrupt end, the participants in the execution eventually get word that the US occupying forces are out to bring all war criminals, including this bunch, to justice.  Our \\"hero\\", Takuya, attempts to avoid prosecution by fleeing and attempting to set up a new identity.  Much of the book is a sort of suspense novel as Takuya has to keep on the run.  Eventually he finds a job with a very ideal employer.  The pay isn't great but the security is all Takuya is looking for.  Eventually, this safe haven comes apart and Takuya must eventually face his accusers.  I will let the reader find out for themselves how all of this turns out. <br /> <br />I mentioned feeling uncomfortable, at times, with this book.  I guess there were several aspects.  One issue that certainly is open to discussion is the US bombing of Japan towards the end of the war.  Specifically mentioned were the incendiary bombing of Tokyo and, of course, the two atomic bombs that were dropped.  Takuya and his comrades felt justified in executing the downed US airmen because they had specifically targeted women, children, and other non-military personnel for their victims.  To the Japanese, this was unheard of; or so we were to believe.  I read a book entitled \\"The Rape of Nanking\\" several years ago which disturbingly detailed the treatment the Japanese soldiers dealt to the Chinese civilians and women in particular.  The fact that this was carried out by foot soldiers instead of airmen is, to me, immaterial.  Nonetheless, the author tells the story as if only the US military was guilty of targeting non-belligerents during the war.  Of course, the fact that our \\"hero\\" knowingly committed the acts that he did made it difficult to sympathcize with him.  However, I freely admit that, as the book progressed, I found myself hoping that he would succeed in his new lifestyle.  Finally, the portrayal of the US soldier of occupation was fairly negative.  They came across as drunks, rapists, and bullies.  Conversely the policies of the US occupying forces found favor with Takuya.  This was an ironic twist because, in the beginning, it was the US soldier that was portrayed in a positive way while the US government was portrayed as bad. <br /> <br />After getting over my sense of guilt as I pulled for Takuya, I found the book quite enjoyable.  The book's title basically states the message; justice can come in many forms.  Sometimes  people sentence themselves to a greater punishment than the courts do.  Takuya may not have found the Garden of Eden in his life as a fugitive.  However, he had within his grasp a meaningful, rewarding life that his prior actions prevented him from being able to realize.  The book seems to end rather abruptly but, since this later point had already been made, a simple wrap-up was all that was necessary.	2004-08-17

I just couldn't follow the story line. I had the choice of putting it away, going back to the beginning, or keep reading. I did the latter. There have been times I've done that with books that lost me early on. Some came back to life rather quickly. However, &quot;Memoirs of Many in One&quot; never did come around. There were moments when it seemed like I was coming out of a coma and actually followed the narative for several pages. Soon enough the book lapsed back into a confusing chaotic mish mash of I don't know what. The story intends to be the memoirs of an eccentric woman. It reads like an erotic aristocratic acid trip. I suspect that someone else may come away with the opinion that this is a briliant attempt to recreate the thought process of a deranged individual. If so, they will have probably invested a lot more time in this book than I felt it was worth to me. <br />  <br /> Patrick White is a Nobel Prize-winning author which is why I tried to read this book in the first place. I read up on the purpose of the award and I came away thinking that the Academy wanted to award someone from Australia. (No offense to the many talented artists in Australia but does this mean Antarctica's next?). I have read a novel of his; &quot;A Fringe of Leaves&quot;, a collection of short stories; &quot;The Cockatoos&quot; and now a novella; &quot;Memoirs of Many in One&quot;. I have two other works of his yet to read; &quot;Voss&quot; and &quot;Riders in the Chariot&quot;. Both are more highly rated than the aforementioned works. Both are lengthy novels. Based on my introduction, it will be a monsoon if I ever get around to reading either of them.	2004-07-26

I was impressed just several pages into the book with the realization that this is not like any other autobiography (or regular biography) that I have read. This is a gifted author trying in words to make sense out of his life. That's not to imply that the author is finding out who he is right along with the rest of us. Rather, it is the author reliving those years with the ability to diagram the important events of his life no matter how meaningless they may have seemed at the time. One of the aspects that makes this book so impressive is that the author has led, from the beginning, a very interesting life. He was born into a poverty that had just enough of an income to give him the educational opportunities to discover his talents. Easily distracted by the here and now, Garcia Marquez had many chances to go irretrievibly astry. Yet these chances also introduced him to many people and places that would be the subjects of his writings. Clearly though, the most influencial people were his family; especially his mother and grandfather. Along the way we see the seeds (and, in some cases, fruition) of virtually every one of his books with the exception of &quot;Clandestine in Chile&quot; and &quot;News of a Kidnapping&quot;. We watch the young man grow and mature into a socially and politically conscious reporter. Every step of the way is brought to us so intimately by the author that we feel as if we are sitting silently at the same table as he. All of this is more impressive when considering that the author's previous works of non-fiction are, in my opinion, of a lesser quality than his fiction. In the others, he was writing as a reporter. In &quot;Living to Tell the Tale&quot; he comes across as a tour guide of his life. The book actually loses some of its' impact once he does become a reporter (about 2/3's of the wayinto the book). We switch from the interpersonal to the events of the day. However, the positive side is that Garcia Marquez was often an eye-witness to the major events in the Columbia of his youth.  <br />  <br /> All in all this is a tremendous work by a very gifted author. My favorite book of his is &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot;. This one is a close second.	2004-07-26

The combination of a good director in charge of putting together a movie from a Stephen King book is an almost guaranteed winner. However, it never occurred to me to actually read one of his books until my children got me &quot;The Green Mile&quot; for my birthday. I was impressed with his style of writing and the way he developed his characters. Although there are some strange passages in the book, the story is rather passive. This despite the prison setting that could be the source of a lot more volatile situations. This isn't a story about a visual, threatening horror. Rather it is a challenge to readers to consider several things that could be seen as horrific. One is, just how great is longevity to a person who starts to realize that he might be around a lot longer than he cares to be. The other is, how would we treat someone whose greatness cannot be understood. I suspect that King might be suggesting the question of how would we treat Jesus Christ if he reappeared today. This question may be a bit of a stretch inasmuch as the character in question doesn't exactly deliver the wisdom that Christ did in his day. However, the idea that it is better to go ahead and administer &quot;justice&quot; rather than acknowledge divinity was something that also happened 2000 years ago. Stephen King's movies have shown me that he is a great storyteller. &quot;The Green Mile&quot; showed me that he is a good author as well. <br />  <br />	2004-07-23
US	40051756	R219KLQYYM2N54	1588275736	812817522	Andrea Delfin	Books	3	5	6	N	Y	adequate but not overwelming	In my never-ending quest to read all of the Nobel Prize-winning novelists, I considered myself lucky to have come across &quot;Andrea Delfin&quot; by Paul Heyse; the winner in 1910.  Heyse was 80 when he received the award which makes him more a 19th than 20th Century author.  The style present in &quot;Andrea Delfin&quot; clearly reflects that point.  This is a short novella of some 98 pages and it concerns political intrigue in 18th Century Venice.  The title character is somewhat mysterious to the rest of the world but less so to the reader.  The politics of the times were rather repressive and there was a struggle to overthrow those in power.  Into the fray comes the mysterious Mr. Delfin who learns that even the best intentions can backfire.  <br />Oh well, it's not a bad story but I didn't come to understand why the author was awarded the Nobel Prize.  This is a recently translated book and seemed to be issued from a sort of &quot;mom and pop&quot; printing house.  The translator, Gunther Olesch, gives a good literary background of the author as well as helpful list of the author's works previously translated into English (none of which I've ever come across).  I looked in a web-site that was cited and found that Heyse, among other things, was considered the creator of the modern psychological novella.  I guess I could detect some of that in &quot;Andrea Delfin&quot; but, again, it was not particularly noteworthy.  Nonetheless, I would look forward to the opportunity to give a shot at another work by the author.	2004-07-10

His classic \\"The Bridge on the Drina\\" is his masterpiece.  Many consider \\"The Bosnian Chronicle\\" to be even better although I found it a bit long.  \\"The Woman from Sarajevo\\" is good but it isn't in the class of the former two books.  I'd rate it \\"3.5\\" if that were an option.  It tells the tale of greed and how a person can be consumed by this passion.  We get an idea early on that this is where the book is going and it does become rather predictable.  However, there was some interesting glimpses of life in Sarajevo and Belgrade that made the book worthwhile.  Of particular interest was the assassination of Arch Duke Ferdinand in June 18, 1914.  The main character is a Serb in Bosnia (Sarajevo) at a time when that was not a good thing (given the aforementioned assasination).  The description the life of a minority Serb in Sarajevo is very intereseting and illuminating on a lesser known corner of WWI.  A fair amount of the book involves this period of occupation during WWI.  The picture of life in post-war Belgrade is similarly interesting.<br />The book notes that Andric wrote \\"The Woman from Sarajevo\\" from December, 1943-October, 1944 at a time he he was essentially under house arrest in Nazi occupied Yugoslavia.  This adds more meaning to much of what we read in this book.  I guess you could identify an analogy between being a captive to greed and a captive to an occupying force.  However, I'm not sure that the author makes the analagy fit as well as I would have liked (if that was his intent).  Although not his best work, it is, as in all of his works I've read, an excellent glimpse of the Balkan world so foreign to most of us.	2004-07-01

This has resulted in some long searches and some (occassionally) boring books.  However, it has, in general, been a most rewarding experience.  One of the highlights thus far has been &quot;discovering&quot; &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot;.  Although I read the book 14 years ago, it has stayed with me.  <br />The basic story is using the construction of a bridge centuries ago to trace the history of the Balkan area (and, occassionally, country) of Bosnia.  What makes the book interesting is what makes that area interesting; the many different ethnic groups that fought over and, sometimes, co-existed in this region where the Muslim crusades were stopped but not repulsed.  There are many stories centered around the bridge and they tell not only of the history of the area but of the people as well.  This is a well-written, absorbing book.  I have read several other books since by Ivo Andric and they have been worthwhile as well.  However, it is &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot; that properly marked him as one of the better European authors of the 20th Century.  This is a literary experience that you should not miss.	2004-06-29

I was aware that the author, Eyvind Johnson, was a winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature but wasn't sure I would ever find a book in English of his that I could read.  When I finally got around to reading &quot;The Days of His Grace&quot;, I spent most of the book wondering what the point of the story was.  As the book was coming to its' conclusion, I realized that it certainly qualifies as a love story; one in which a life-long love is given its' chance in the twilight years.  OK, I guess I appreciated that aspect of the story.  I also realized that those Charlemagne buffs out there (if any) could enjoy this book somewhat.  In addition, fans of Medievel Europe could probably appreciate the book as well.  However, this is not a biography of Charlamagne and, although he is &quot;His Grace&quot;, little specific information about him is supplied.  There is also not enough about daily life in Medievel Europe to make this any sort of &quot;cult classic&quot; for those fans.<br />What the bulk of the book seems to be about is the members of an Italian family of intermediate nobility who put their fortune on a failed plot.  What happens to them over the years is, apparently, the crux of the story.  I had trouble keeping track of who was who and which ones were the &quot;good guys&quot;.  As I said, in the end some pieces start to fall into place for an adequate story.  However, the hopes for something special had long since been discarded.  <br />Martin Seymour Smith, in a review of 20th Century Literature, commented that the Swedish over-rate their authors.  He points out that not all countries are guilty of this and cites the Dutch as an example.  I quess I would have to cite this book as supporting evidence.  However, it finished well enough for me to give the author one more chance.  My research on the author tells me that his focus is on man's frustration.  &quot;The Days of His Grace&quot; certainly frustrated me.	2004-06-20

I don't ever recall any other book where the main character bought his suit at the J C Penney store in Williston, ND.  However, I took off a &quot;star&quot; to account for this for those 99.999% of the country that don't live in this neck of the woods.  The story opens with a compelling scenario; a one-car accident reveals the death of its' two passengers; an 18-year old girl and a prominent man old enough to be her father.  It was obvious that they were leaving together and not just for the weekend.  The sherrif of this small Eastern Montana community takes it upon himself to protect his community from scandal.  That's the basic plot of the book.  There are times when you expect more out of the book but, in the end, we are left with a telling irony about the best laid schemes of man.  It may not be the ending that you would like but it does leave a worthy message.  The book reads well and moves along at a steady pace.  If you don't expect too much, this is a story that will satify most readers	2004-06-11

That notoriety is a shame because it detracts from the greater story of how so many individuals could have made through what had happened to them.  For those totally uninitiated to the story, a plane load of Uruguayan rugby players (and family members) goes down in the mountains of the Andes en route to their game in Chile.  All efforts to locate the downed plane were unsuccessful and the search eventually is called off.  However, many of the passengers have survived and are essentially, in good health.  They gather together their resources which were limited because the flight was relatively short and thus the on-board supplies were short as well.  Things happen as the survivors await the rescue that doesn't come and the most infamous thing that happens is that many of the survivors take to eating flesh of their departed.  Ultimately, in what is the most spectacular event of the book, a couple of men decide to reach civiliztion on their own (scenes from &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; come to mind) and they actually succeed.  This leads to the resue of the others as the whole world discovers their amazing survival.  They also discover one of the not-so-secret means of their survival; their canabalism. A variety of sleazy accounts in print and film sought to depict that shocking aspect of an otherwise amazing survival story.  Fortunately &quot;Alive&quot; (both the book and, later, the film) rise above that to bring the real story.  This account is one you won't be able to put down until you've turned the last page.	2004-05-29

The current one certainly has a number of twists that will intrigue the more than casual observer.  On some elections, the course of history is crucially determined.  Probably the last one of those was 1932 but you could make the case for several since then.  I'm not sure that 1968 qualifies as such an election.  After all, it seemed like we redid it in 1972.  However, it was probably the most passionate election and the most tragic election year in many decades.  I have read quite a number of accounts of the election of 1968 and most of them are long forgotten.  However, the one that stands out above all the rest for me is clearly &quot;An American Melodrama&quot;.  Perhaps it is because so many of the books I read were by those in or close to the action as well as affiliated with one side or the other (or the still other).  &quot;An American Melodrama&quot; was written by a trio of British journalists who seemed better able to step back a from the emotional involvement for a better overall perspective of what happened.  Their sober, insightful look at the whole process is the version that should be the textbook for future researchers into the subject.  You don't have to be a researcher, however, to be able to enjoy this book.  If you actively lived through those years or if you just happened to have heard of a few of the main events, the retelling of this emotional time in US history is fascinating.	2004-05-26

An additional few stories here and a movie or two there probably compiles as much as most of us know on the subject.  For anyone who would like to know more, I highly recommend &quot;Prisoners of the Japanese&quot;.  It is a well documented and well told story that uses certain units as a focus on what it was like to be a prisoner of the Japanese.  Through the eyes of these survivors, Daws recreates a living hell than no one should ever have to go through and, more importantly, one than no one should ever administer or tolerate.  Daws looks at all of the different groups of prisoners including the British, Australians, and the Dutch.  The war was over so early for the Dutch that it was somewhat of a surprize to realize that they were participants as well.  Many images remain from this book and most are inappropriate to toss out in a review like this.  This book is not for those with weak stomaches.  In fact, I loaned this book to a friend after I finished it.  He finally gave it back to me a year later saying it was just too difficult for him to finish reading.  The author takes us through hell and back.  There is a summation of what happened afterwards and that was a helpful aspect of the book although we are still left a bit short of empty.  <br />This was a major event in 20th Century history and persons unfamiliar ought to become more aware of the depth of the brutality that has emerged in times of war.  As I write this review, there is a lot of hand wringing, soul searching, and congressional investigations going on in the US over abusues American soldiers inflicted on Iraqi prisoners.  What we are finding out is wrong and upsetting.  However, the rhetoric and hyperbole suggest that we have forgotten the depths to which otherwise civilized nations have sunk in similar conditions in the past.  It doesn't make what we've done acceptable but the comparisons some people are making betray their ignorance.  If the pictures of Iraq shocked you, please read this book.	2004-05-25

I read this book over 30 years ago and it remains one of the most impressive works I've ever read.  It was actually I book I got from the book club because I forgot to tell them not to send it to me.  I thought that I might as well read it and I was thoroughly astounded by what it had to say.  The author, Desmond Morris, takes a look at man as a part of the animal kingdom and gives us a portrait of a species only slightly above other genuses and species.  His examples and explanations are thoroughly compelling and one comes away presuaded.  The question is; persuaded of what?  Does &quot;The Naked Ape&quot; denigrate humans or elevate our fellow primates?  You decide when you read this most enjoyable work written by an author who knows how to communicate his ideas.	2004-05-16

I was becoming more and more interested in the political process and thought that this would be an interesting perspective.  It was indeed.  William F. Buckley Jr., who was well-known on the national scene, accepted the nomination of the Conservative Party for the office of Mayor of New York.  He was running against liberal candidates from both the Republican and Democratic Parties (John Lindsey and Abe Beame respectively).  From the start, Buckley used his platform for promoting the policies of Conservatives.  He may have taken his ideas seriously but he never took himself seriously.  I'll always remember his response to a reporter's question, &quot;What is the first thing you'll do if elected?&quot;  Buckley deadpanned, &quot;Demand a recount&quot;.  There were ups and downs (although not necessarily in the polls).  I remember a sort of controversy over Buckley's idea for bike paths in NYC.  In the end Buckley lost (by a landslide!) but we all won with his official recount of the campaign in &quot;The Unmaking of a Mayor&quot;.	2004-05-16

It was such an exspansive book that I kept putting off reading it.  However, the more and more I read about aspects of the Eastern Front, the more I realized that I was missing the big picture.  I realized that I needed to read &quot;Russia at War&quot; in order to put things in perspective.  I took a deep breath and found myself very satisfactorily immersed in a fascinating look at a &quot;win at any cost&quot; war.  There's a reason that the paperback was 941 pages (not counting bibliography and index); this was one long, drawn out war.  The Western Front had action throughout the same period but, until D-Day, not much to match the scale of Russia's ongoing battle.  This was a repeated theme in which Stalin kept insisting that the Western powers do SOMETHING to take some of the relentless pressure off of his armies.  Details abound in &quot;Russia at War&quot; but this in not a book that bogs down in them.  Leningrad, Stalingrad, and other battles are focussed upon but it is the whole story that I appreciated.  That is, the whole of the military story.  Werth, who was present throughout much of what he covered, does not seem to do well with the political perspective.  However, neither did the Western powers at the time.  After the war many jump shifted from allies to enemies without missing a beat but Werth seemed stuck in the &quot;allies for victory&quot; mindset.  <br />I've read 200 page books that I couldn't wait to get done with.  This is a book that kept my rapt attention throughout thanks in part to the magnitude of the subject and in part to the skill of the author.  It's not something to pick up on a rainy day.  However, it IS something one should read it one wishes to know the whole picture of the War in Europe.	2004-05-16

I wondered at the time if I would have appreciated it more as a teenager or as someone in his 40's.  I'm of the opinion that it works better as a retrospective on an indulgent generation rather than a &quot;how to&quot; book for on-going hedonism.  I'm sure that there are other opinions on this, however.  I must admit that it is really an enjoyable book and one wonders about the extent of detachment or involvement of Tom Wolfe.  He obviously spent a great deal of time with Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters and hung with them long enough to see a beginning as well as an end.  I think that the ability of the book to bring things to a conclusion was helpful.  Nonetheless, the journey Wolfe takes us through is fast paced and exciting and we meet many familiar names along the way.  Perhaps the most surprizing familiar name for me was Larry McMurtry whom I did not associate as one who might have followed that crowd.  It was certainly a time of awakening although often in ways that may have been better to sleep off.  There is an electricity to the book (as there was to the era) and Wolfe certainly helps keep it charged up.  For those who don't know much about the 60's, this book is essential to understanding those times.  To those who lived it, this book is a reminder of how much fun it was as well as how lucky most of us were to survive it.  Things are different now.  As evidence of that, consider our recent president who &quot;smoked but never inhaled&quot;.  Tom Wolfe wrote something that many of can now read with a red-faced smile.  Who knew anyone was taking notes at the time?	2004-05-16

It contains an abstract of the Court of Inquiry that was requested by Major Reno in 1879.  The first part of the book is a helpful preface to the inquiry.  The rest is mostly testimony from the inquiry itself.  At time the testimony gets a bit belabored but it is still fascinating to read the testimony of eyewitnesses to the Reno theater of battle.  Major Reno comes across as a tragic perhaps even pathetic victim of history.  He is exonerated but, by then, popular belief had already condemned his anyway.  This book is a crucial resource for the serious (and casual) students of the Battle of the Little Big Horn.	2004-05-15

Unfortunately, I let this book sit on the bookshelf for nearly twenty years before I got around to reading it.  I was appalled at the extent of US governmental indifference and interference!  One of the major problems facing the Jews who could sense the imminent danger in Germany was that of finding some place to move to.  Most of the Western world did not want to accept them as refugees and especially in the numbers that were materializing.  As the grandson of an immigrant, I had written a term paper on the US immigration policy with apparrent pride when I was in junior high school.  I understood the various quota systems that favored North Western Europeans and heavily discriminated against those of other races.  I had understood the reasons that it took two of my grandfather's brothers so long to immigrate here.  I understood why many immigrants went to Canada instead (including the fact that Canada is a fine country).  I had understood the laws requiring that persons coming to this country needed to provide proof that they would be able to provide for their own support once they got here.  However, Arthur Morse gave examples after examples of how all of the existing immigration laws were twisted, tightened and squeezed to keep the Jewish refugees from finding a new home here.  We were just another country that left them to fend helplessly for themselves in Nazi Germany.  \\"While Six Million Died\\" is a difficult book to read for an American.  It is a reminder of the anti-semitism that generations after the Holocaust find hard to understand.  At best Americans can say that their government's behavior at the time wasn't any worse than that of other governments.  The shame is that it wasn't any better either.  America has faced its' disgrace over its' past racism and the scandal of the Japanese internment camps.  However, I have not noticed much ado about the issues that Morse raises in \\"While Six Million Died\\".  That is why this is such an important book to read.	2004-05-15

I was curious how life under the dictatorial mad man looked to everyday German people.  What I got was one man's struggle against the Nazi government.  I was impressed that Mr. Engelmann was a man who did his best to stand up to the forces of evil whenever possible.  He was imprisoned in Dachau and survived the war to go on to become a successful journalist.  Men of his bravery deserve our respect and admiration.  Had his book been entitled something more along the lines of \\"My private Struggle Against the Nazi Government\\" perhaps more people would have bought the book.  My interest is in how it looked from the inside; not by someone who knew the truth from the beginning.  Rather, how was everyday life like to an apolitical individual who went about his day to day life.  I have always wondered about how such a monstrosity like Hitler came into power and staid in power.  Maybe I've already found the answer but don't know it.  Maybe I'll never fully understand such an answer.  However, the answer certainly wasn't in this book.  That's why I was disappointed in it.  I'm sure if I had read it for what it actually is, I would have appreciated it more.	2004-05-14

I was fascinated with the many stories that were strewn together within the events that were the final days of the Third Reich.  It was a real page-turner for me and I enjoyed the mutliple perspectives; Russian, German, Western Allied.  Over the years I have read other books that dealt in part with this subject.  However, I always looked back on &quot;The Last 100 Days&quot; as the real authority on the subject.  Much of what happened over the next 50 years had its' beginnings in these last 100 days and John Toland does an excellent job of explaining that.  Anyone interested in either WWII or the Cold War should read this book.	2004-05-13

I lost track of how many times the author touched me with a passage in &quot;No Great Mischief&quot;.  That is no small feat given the mere 283 pages that seem like they're double-spaced.  The life of the main character is touched by many of his relatives and we are able to become closely acquainted with many of them.  The tragedies that befall family members touch us; deeply at times.  We know that there is a pathos to the story right from the beginning as MacLeod jumps back and forth in time (sometimes going centuries in a single bound).  Through it all, our narrator is witness to many things and it is his remarkable ability to bear witness that is the success of the book.  <br />The problem with &quot;No Great Mischief&quot; is that it trys to do and be too much.  The story is best when the narrator witnesses an event.  This enables him to share his feelings.  There are too many places when the narrator tells of what had been told to him.  This makes him &quot;create&quot; the feelings of others and he is much better when he sticks to his own.  In addition, the author seems to be in search of a greater theme for his story.  We are given scenes from Scottish Highlander history that are, apparently, &quot;recreated&quot; in a modern way; at least that's what I THINK the author was trying to do.  The title comes from a quote out of the Battle of Quebec in the 1700's about aScottish military unit in the battle.  I understood it to mean that the British general was dismissing the importance of his Scottish Highlanders.  I understood that to mean that we were given a glimpse of the lives of people whom the world would otherwise dismiss as unimportant.  All of this is fine but it is not necessary because the book stands better without it.  On the other hand, those proud of their Scottish ancestry are free to disagree with this point.  Read it and see what you think.  I assure you, this is a book well worth reading.	2004-05-09

Those who were old enough to remember the Russo-Finnish Winter War of 1939-40 generally remember it as the struggle of a David vs a Goliath.  For awhile David was winning and the empathy and sympathy of the world was starting to pull behind it.  Ultimately, however, Goliath prevailed and the attention of the world was quickly directed elsewhere.  What really happened in that brief war?  Fortunately, William Trotter has put together a well-researched and well-written account of that conflict.  There are times in this book that the victories of the underdog Finns can get you really worked up.  Unfortunately, history cannot be changed and we know throughout the book that the Finns will eventually lose.  Once the dam was burst, the war was quickly ended.  The relationship between Finland and Russia has been a stormy one.  Many of those who cheered for the Finns in the Winter War were akwardly forced to change their stance when the Finns joined with Nazi Germany in the invasion of Russia a couple of years later.  That is, however, a different story.  Trotter gives us the Finns as heros in a lost cause.  It is a worthwhile story to read.	2004-05-07

Miles and the Twilight of the Frontier Army	Books	4	6	7	N	N	History through Biography	Robert Wooster has picked an excellent subject (Nelson Miles) to show the transition of the US Army from the Civil War to WWI.  General Miles was a man who seemed to be in the thick of things at just about every stage of the way.  What was of particular interest for me in this book was the changes in the military brought upon by the end of the Civil War.  Brevet officers full of past glory were suddenly fighting for junior officer posts and finding advancement almost non-existant.  Through his stubborn perseverance, Miles slowly but surely rose in the ranks.  Along the way he was involved directly or indirectly with the Civil War, the Great Sioux War, the capture of Chief Joseph, the capture of Geronimo, the Battle of Wounded Knee, and the Spanish American War.  At times he seemed lucky, conniving, able, and inept.  &quot;General Miles and the Twilight of the Frontier Army&quot; is a book that deals equally with both of its' title subjects.  Wooster brings us both the glory of history and the drudgery of its' shadows.  It leaves one with a rather melancholy feeling as a way of life drew to a close along with its' century.	2004-05-06

Each has a legion of students and enthusiasts accompanied by a number of printed resources.  Stackpole Books has added to the printed resources on the Little Big Horn with its' collection of books known as The Custer Library.  The most important of these books, in my opinion, is &quot;The Custer Myth&quot;  It contains just about all of the available first person accounts of the battle known to exist.  Many of the accounts are rather short but all are interesting.  For the &quot;Last Stand&quot; buffs, it is like waking up on Christmas morning to find that you got everything you wanted except actual newsreel footage.  For the casual observer of the subject, this may be the downfall of the book.  After all, the stories greatly overlap and repeat each other.  In doing so, they add another dimension of personalizing the battle even more.  No Custer enthusiast should be without this book and no private library of American History is complete without it either.  Do yourself a favor and add it to your library as well.	2004-05-05

I read this interesting history of the Guy Fawkes affair and came away with a deeper appreciation of our own First Ammendment to the US Constitution.  I'm not sure that this was the intent of the author.  However, her depiction of a state-run Christion denomination finally clarified my puzzlement of what I felt to be a misinterpretation of the First Ammendment.  The problem we have in this country is that we've never had a state-run church that was common-place in Europe at the time of our birth as a nation.  We never experienced (with the possible exception of the Mormons) the sort of religious persecution that followers of out-of-favor sects experienced in Europe.  Ms. Fraser has given an excellent portrayal of what such a persecution was like in the England of King James I.  Consider a persecution so wide spread that a unique form of architecture developed with the sole purpose of designing hidden prayer rooms for Catholics to worship in.  The penalties for worshipping at other than the state-sponsored Anglican Church were severe and widely meted out.  As a member of the world-wide (but not world-sponsored) Anglican Church of today, I took no satisfaction in being Number One.  It was certainly this world view that led our Founding Fathers to placing the first clause in the Bill of Rights which read, &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.  Unfortunately, time seemed to wash away the purpose of those words to where we now have to hold our breath to see if &quot;under God&quot; stays in our Pledge of Allegiance.  Arguing the point with those unaware of the way things once were almost seems a waste of time.  However, the more people read &quot;Faith and Treason&quot; the more people will know the true meaning of Freedom of (not from) Religion.	2004-05-04

As with any anthology of \\"the best of\\", there are selections that will make one wonder about its' inclusion while there are others whose omission will seem equally unjust.  However, such arguments only occur when somebody puts out their choices for public consumption.  Having said that, I offer the following criticisms.  First of all, Halberstam, in his introduction, heaps a bit too much praise on Gay Talese's story about Joe Dimaggio.  One reads it thinking that, yes this is good, but it's not THAT good.  There was a fairly lengthy story about Bobby Fischer that was interesting but kept me wondering if chess was a sport.  There were a number of short articles and feature articles that were good but still made you wonder why they were included.  However, there was plenty of the better and some of the best.  The book gave me a good introduction to an excellent sports writer I had not previously known of; W C Heinz.  There was the fascinating \\"Outside\\" magazine article by Jon Krakauer, \\"Into Thin Air\\" that led to the later (equally excellent) book of the same name.  There is a touching story about Tommy LaSorda's son, Al Stump on Ty Cobb, an interesting story about a hockey \\"enforcer\\", a disturbing article about the steroid madness of body building, the obligatory yet interesting article about Tiger Woods, and a closing section on Muhammed Ali.  Unfortunately, the latter section includes an endless article about the Champ by Norman Mailer ironicly titled \\"Ego\\".  There's lots more but, to be honest, by the time I finished the book, a lot of the earlier selections were by then forgotten.  My nomination for the most egregious omission, Frank DeFord's \\"Sports Illustrated\\" article \\"The Toughest Coach the Ever Was\\".  This is an enjoyable book.  Some articles may not have merited inclusion in a book of this title but they were still fairly interesting.	2004-04-09

I have several other resources to assist with sermon preparation but I immediately took a liking to this one.  It is well organized along by focussing on the readings of each successive Sunday (and Holy Day) of the seasons rather than by the books of the New Testament.  This is helpful in many ways.  For example, each service date starts with a summation of the theme of that date.  The readings are listed and variations within denominations are identified.  There is a discussion of each text and a section on the &quot;response&quot; to each text.  Some of the responses may include a story you've heard a time or two.  However, the reader will usually get some help with direction which, after all, is why you would get a book like this in the first place.  My best recommendation for the book is that I have ordered the next one now that this one has come to the end of the section of the church's calender that it covers.	2004-04-06
US	40051756	R683CI265GZWW	0140864652	194037742	Men at Arms (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Carry on Soldiering	This is fifth book I have read by Evelyn Waugh.  I have come to appreciate his style of writing and his style of humor.  Both of those reasons would justify, in my opinion, reading any and all of his novels.  However, for those expecting a lot more, the author doesn't always deliver.  That is the case of &quot;Men at Arms&quot;.  I came away wondering what the point of the book was meant to be.  I also came away wondering where all of the emotion behind the advent and early days of WWII were.  Maybe the author, who lived through that time, gave us a better view of reality than the Winston Churchill &quot;Finest Hour&quot; image that we all hold.  Then again, I don't want to criticize this book, or any book, for not being what it never intended to be.  What we do get is a humorous look at a collection of individuals coming together to become British officers from scratch.  The various ways they act, react, and interact is what makes the book enjoyable.  The main character, Guy Crouchback, comes from a somewhat fallen aristocratic family and feels the need to make something of himself as war seems imminent.  Being in his early 30's makes it difficult for him to find his spot until he meets up with an old associate who gets him into a newly forming brigade.  To try and explain any more of the plot might make it seem dull.  In fact, it moves along well; not because of action but because of the interaction.  Guy Crouchback is like all of Waugh's main characters that I have come across so far; they have a certain detachment from what's happening around them.  That aspect gives for a keener insight but can tend to leave the reader a bit detached as well.  If you've read Waugh before then you know what you're getting in.  If not, this may not be the book to start with.  I'd suggest &quot;A Handful of Dust&quot; instead.	2004-04-04

It is well written, easy to follow, and full of insights and observations about...about what?  That's what got me as I was reading &quot;Waiting for the Barbarians&quot;.  Don't get me wrong, this book is enjoyable in and of itself.  However, as I read more and more into the book, I tried to get more and more out of the book.  I may have been trying too hard.  The political subject matter made you want to understand the author's allegory to some recent point in history.  Since Coetzee is South African then the obvious allegory is the turmoil in South Africa at the time this book was written (1980).  I could see this allegory somewhat; a different culture has taken over the land of a backward people, the ends of their empire feel the strain of a control that is slipping, the more the control slips, the more brutal their reaction to the &quot;Barbarians&quot;.  A man of some standing protests this treatment as he becomes more and more inquisitive of the humanity of the &quot;enemy&quot;.  His efforts at peace-making lead to his own punishment for siding with the eneny.  Things start to fall apart at that point as the control starts to evaporate...  Ok, I don't want to retell the whole story here; Coetzee does an excellent job of that.  I guess at the end, there is an expectation of things to come that are born out of fear that leaves us hanging in limbo.  That worked alright for me because I enjoyed the book from beginning to end.  I understood this to be a glimpse of what it was like to be at the frontier at the time of a sweeping change of power.  Perhaps that IS an allegory of South Africa circa 1980.	2004-03-27

It tells of life in Cape Breton in the province, I believe, of Nova Scotia.  It is written by a man who grew up there.  This is a part of the nearby world that I have always wanted to visit.  I may yet get to do that but I'm not sure whether MacLeod's book has made me more anxious or less anxious to do so.  His Breton is a place where life is not at all like the pretty postcard that many of us imagine.  In his collection of short stories and sketches, we come away with an appreciation of the hard times and sturdy people but we don't necessarily want them moving next door.  There are a number of stories and scenes that really bring people to life in a very down to earth manner.  The story of the loneliness of the girl in the title story was  overwelming.  I recall a number of references to sex that were made throughout the book in a sort of agrarian manner; taking the cow to be \\"serviced\\" by the neighbor's bull was almost as emotional as some of the human intercourses.  Things had their purpose and occassionally there was a purpose for fun but much of the imagry I took away from this book was that of a very stoic people.  I gave it a rating of \\"5\\" because I rounded up this time from a 4.5.  This book definitely will have an impact on its' reader.  Not a joyful or inspiring impact but an impact nonetheless,	2004-03-27
US	40051756	R3C2SCBN95H38Z	0807115673	387960169	Dark Lanterns: Secret Political Societies, Conspiracies, and Treason Trials in the Civil War	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Good Research, Challenging Writing	Let me begin by saying that I believe that this book is a work of scholarly research.  I should rate it as such but I lack the credentials.  I will have some comments about the matter but it is only from opinion and not fact.  I rated this book a &quot;2&quot; because it was challenging to stay interested in it.  I found myself putting it down periodically so as to read something else just to break the monotony.  Other times I found myself skimming just to get through it.  Bear in mind that it is only 244 pages long!  The problem is common enough with scholarly books; the author is normally better skilled at research and analysis than at writing skills.  Thus we must suffer through the latter in order to get at the former.  In all fairness, I've struggled through more tedious writing styles than this but at this point in my life, I don't have the patience anymore.  If academic writing style does not bore you then I would give this book a &quot;4&quot;.<br />The subject matter certainly seems interesting enough; secret political societies, conspiracy trials in the Civil War (this is also the subtitle of the book).  The author deserves kudos (I believe) for setting it straight that there were no conspiracies of merit despite the general suspiscion to the contrary.  This is part of the downfall of the book as well.  We read about a number of secret societies that were started up but, essentially, never amounted to anything of interest.  Thus the author spoils his book by telling the truth when just the opposite would have made the reading a lot more exciting.  We need to know this, I guess, and in all the detail that is given.  However, even casual followers of Civil War history are aware of civil rights issues in the North during the administration of Abraham Lincoln.  We get a sampling of what that was about with a number of trials that should never have happened over crimes that were never committed.  Yet, if this was all there was to such governmental excesses in atime of war, we owe Abe something of an appology.<br />There is an epilogue to the book that is probably the most interesting part of it.  The last part of the epilogue enables the author to discredit just about everything ever written on the subject.  The author, Frank Klement, may be correct.  However, the volume of discredited sources (often written from first hand witness and/or experience) makes one wonder if Klement may have ignored some legitimate evidence to the contrary.  However, I will finish by crediting him with the scholarship and myself with the ignorance.  Nonetheless, I know this book could have been better written (where are you when we need you Bruce Catton?).	2004-03-14

This is exceptionally true at the end of the book.  In between the beginning and end is some very disturbing truths about the conquistadores's savage treatment of the native Americans they encountered in the New World.  Author Duncan deserves credit for telling it like it is while knowing that his subject becomes less and less of a heroic figure with every ghastly detail.  It is still hard to fathom the incredible destruction of the Incan empire by the small force of Pizarro's men.<br />The author spends a fair amount of time evaluating the available evidence which is helpful.  The second half of the book is an excellent view of SouthEast America that our own immigrant culture knows little about; partly because de Soto's men had so severely impacted it that it was essentially gone when our ancesters first encountered it.  <br />The story of de Soto is essentially the tragedy of a dynamic life cut short, of a quest that fell short, and of a discovery of wealth that went overlooked.  De Soto's focus on gold caused him to overlook a world that would surpass the importance of &quot;wealthier&quot; parts of the New World.  Unfortunately, the book ends with the death of de Soto in present-day Arkansas.  By giving us a single paragraph to tell what happened to his men after that, we come away feeling as stranded and lost as they were.	2004-03-05
US	40051756	R1FCSD4DTXBPLL	0671885375	69492207	Wyatt Earp:  Frontier Marshal	Books	4	35	39	N	N	Essentially an Autobiography	I just finished this most interesting biography of Wyatt Earp and I found myself both fascinated and a bit skeptical.  I was fascinated by the life of Wyatt Earp as it was written by a man who interviewed him over a period of time.  I was impressed with the research that the author, Stuart Lake, appeared to have put into his project.  He had interviewed a number of surviving witnesses to the life of Earp.  He also had a number of newspaper accounts and appears to have located a number of valuable documents in the course of his research.  The book wasted little time in getting to Wyatt's career in law enforcement in the American West.  The bulk, and I mean just about ALL, of the book is spent on his career in Wichta and Dodge City, Kansas as well as Tombstone, Arizona.  The many famous (and not so famous) outlaws and lawmen of the Old West move in and out of the story on a regular basis.  Stuart lists an almost endless number of feats of daring by Wyatt Earp in the process of making his case for Earp as the greatest of all men of the American West.  Many of the events are depicted in great and compelling detail.  Many of the parties are quoted, presumeably, from the memory of Earp himself.  There is never a dull moment in the life of our hero, especially considering that all this action took place over a relatively short period of time.  The book, at times, reads like a well-researched dime novel.  For a chance to re-live the wild, wild West, it has little competition.<br />As for my skepticism, I came away wondering first of all; did all this really happen?  Perhaps it did but our hero (and I am not trying to be facetious, Wyatt Earp truly is a hero) does it all seemingly with one hand tied behind his back.  My other reservation has to do with the politics of the times and places.  There are only good guys and bad guys and no exploration as to the motivations of either side except for good and evil.  I found myself wondering if I were the only source of informationabout the events of my time and I had to relate to the world in 50 years or so the events I had witnessed.  Take the Invasion of Iraq, the presidential election of 2000, or the impeachment of President Clinton.  I certainly could make a claim as to who was the &quot;bad guy&quot; and who was the &quot;good guy&quot; while somneone else of a different political persuasion could make the opposite claim.  There is no one to speak for the opposing view in this book.  The author quotes frequently from the Tombstone &quot;Nugget&quot; but always prefacing the unreliability of the source.  I found myself wondering if there might not have been something of another side to the events in Tombstone.  The labor strife in mining communities of those days was very significant; just study the history of Butte, MT.  Is it possible that Earp supported the powers that be and the miners looked for support from wherever they could get it?  Maybe not, but it would have been helpful if the author tried to give a bit of an impartial look at the motives of the opposing side in Tombstone.  That said, and realizing that this is about Wyatt Earp, not the miners, this is a book well worth the time of any fan of the American West.	2004-02-16

It didn't take long once I started.  This is the type of first-person history that we should have more of.  It is the story of the life of a man who witnessed much that was worth preserving and it was written with the assistance of someone who knew how to bring that story to life.  The story is that of a man named John Leaky who becomes important to the reader but it is what he bears witness to that is important for everyone.  It is the story of the life of a cowboy.  It starts in Texas before the Civil War.  Mr. Leaky shares with us the history his grandfather shared with him and we get an interesting glimpse of early settlements in the Lone Star State.  Comanches, Texas Rangers, cattle rustling, border incidents, etc fill the first third of the book.  <br />As the author becomes a young man, he takes a trip north herding cattle and eventually ends up in the western Dakota/eastern Montana area where he spends the rest of his life.  Since this is the area I've lived in for the last 23 years, I found this part of particular interest.  It can be of interest to anyone else who enjoys the history of the US cowboy.  For those familiar with this part of the country, Mr. Leaky tosses out a lot of names of people he knew and worked with or for.  That adds a great deal value to geneologists and local historians.  As I was reading this at the local gym, I was able to go over and show someone the name of his father and grandfather.  <br />This is a very engaging work of history and can help answer the question, what ever happened to the cowboys of the Old West?	2004-02-02

Although all three books are very good to excellent, the way they fit together creates an excellent story from beginning to end.  We start with &quot;Night&quot; which creates the understanding of the Holocaust through the perceptive eyes and ears of the youthful story teller.  We then move to the book &quot;Dawn&quot; in which we find the main character as a young man who is involved in a moral dilemna.  How he resolves the dilemna makes him realize that there is evil in all of us.  His attempt to rationalize his actions are not sufficient to redeem himself in his own mind.  We finish up with &quot;The Accident&quot; where we find the main character as a middle-aged man whose anger at the world makes him incapable of love.  Certainly all that has preceded in his life helps us to understand his feelings but his anger is uncompromising and a dead end in and of itself.  The problem resolves itself in a solution that brings an impressive closure to essentially all three books.<br />As a matter of clarification, each novel is a seperate story in itself.  There is no &quot;common Character&quot; to all the novels. However, we get a sense that this all happens to one person.  This is how well these stories fit together.  Essentially, these works would appear to be autobiographical which adds to their meaning.  Although Wiesel writes extensively about the Holocaust, there is certainly a special common thread to these stories. Read all three and make sure you read them in their proper order.  Despite their brevity, it is as good an overall explantion, evaluation and summation of the Holocaust as you will find.	2004-02-02

We understand that this is a Holocaust survivor who has seen everyone he loved die or disappear.  We want to reach out and understand him.  However, he is so caught up in his past that he is constantly tearing his present to shreads.  Frankly, we begin to lose empathy and/or sympathy with him until he is finally confronted with the cause and solution of his inner turmoil.  Actually, we know the cause but it becomes clearer as to why that cause is so rooted within him.  The solution is brilliant and worth the whole book for the understanding it brings to the reader.  &quot;The Accident&quot; that happens is merely a vehicle in which the resolutions are enabled to happen.  This book is an important addition to Holocaust Literature and is an essential reading for those truly interested in the subject.  Don't despair with the book until you've finished it.	2004-02-01
US	40051756	R3VV1ND0GRK7H1	0553225367	918700900	Dawn	Books	4	12	13	N	N	disturbing	This short novel was a bit difficult to take but, then, I believe that this was how the author meant it to be.  It is the story of a Holocaust survivor who is now in Palestine involved in the underground efforts to wrest control of the area from the British.  The man must execute a British officer and his struggles with this is the crux of the story. I was not ever quite sure how Wiesel intended us to view the &quot;hero&quot;.  At times I thought that the author wrote as though we would understand the actions of the Jewish militants.  At other times, I felt he was trying to show us that violence only creates more victims.  Certainly, the ending of &quot;Dawn&quot; was a powerful statement of the evil that can emerge from any man no matter how just the cause.  I think that the author adds to his purpose by keeping us a bit off balance throughout the story.  He reminds us that there are no easy answers nor easy perspectives.  <br /> Most of us are aqcuainted with the story of the creation of the Israeli nation including the non-diplomatic efforts by the militant groups.  This book was copyrighted in 1961 at a time when the events could be viewed with a somewhat different perspective. I say this because I found myself drawn to wonder how Wiesel would view a Palastinian suicide bomber.  I guess it was his analytical analysis of the conflicting sides that made me wonder about this.  I realize that it was not the author's point to excuse or justify the violence.  However, there was a certain antiseptic approach to the subject that caused me to wonder about the modern day terrorist.<br />This is a story that will challenge the reader to ask themselves a question or two.  It only takes a short while to read but it has a message that should last quite a while.	2004-01-31

I read &quot;The Late Mattia Pascal&quot; which was OK but nothing special.  I came across a book of his short stories titled &quot;The Naked Truth&quot; and I became immediately aware of the power of this author.  I realized that he is known for his plays but these stories of the rural Sicilian society were outstanding.  I immediately sent for this book to pick up where the others left off.  Unfortunately, these stories are not in the same class as the others.  They are OK but, after reading the other book, I felt let down.  Still there is some good writing in here.  I did enjoy &quot;It's not to be Taken Seriously&quot; and several others.  However, these stories seemed more of mainland Italian urban society and, thus, lacked the unique flavor of the others.  I suggest you read this book and pay special attention to the story &quot;The Fly&quot;.  It was the one story from the other book that was repeated in this one.  In it I believe you will see the type of story I previously found so impressive.	2004-01-24

I really feel like it's a 4.5 but that wasn't an option.  The nagative factors with this book is that it starts off unnecessarrily slow and finishes quite awkwardly.  If you've tried to read this book before and gave up after 50 or so pages, try it again.  The problem rests with the introduction of two essentially dysfunctional main characters.  They take some time to &quot;warm up to&quot;.  The book soon picks up speed and will hold your attention the rest of the way; especially for the last half.  Conversely, after becoming totally engrossed with the novel, the author ends the book too abruptly and tosses in a confusing epilogue.  I can only speak for myself, but I read the epilogue twice and I still don't know how the book turns out.  I guess I'll have to see the movie to find out for sure.<br />Now for the good stuff.  This book is a not-quite-modern day version of Homer's Odyssey.  It is the story of a soldier named Inman attempting to come home to his woman and her difficulties in his absence.  The soldier encounters many serious obstacles and through them we meet a variety of interesting characters.  His woman, Ada, is not pestered by suitors at home ala Penelope (although see if you think that there actually WAS a suitor in her midst as I thought I detected).   Her challenges lie in suddenly finding herself alone in the world and short on survivor skills.  Her dilemnas eventually capture our interest as well.  The author alternates chapters between the trials of Inman and the tribulations of Ada in a way that makes us anxious to keep up on both of them.    This is a book that takes place during the Civil War although little is said of any of the battles themselves.  It is, however, an excellent glimpse into the life at home in a South that had already lost but was still fighting.  <br />Some books run 100 pages too long.  This one was at least 25 pages too short.  Maybe it's just me but I just can't believe the abrupt ending to the book and the confusing and/or pointless epilogue.  After doing so well for 300 pages, the author, Charles Frazier, definitely comes up short in my book.	2004-01-18

I did not particularly enjoy her other work from the science fiction genre, &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot;.  However, I understand that that book was one of Atwood's most popular works probably because it was a favorite among feminists.  I doubt feminists would find much to relate to in this book unless it was how men have managed to finally screw everything up completely.  I have never been much of a fan of science fiction but I admit that it reads better when a writer of Atwood's skills is the author.<br />This book starts out a bit confusing and left me unsure if I should re-read the first 20 or so pages to try and figure out what was going on.  However, I soon found myself in the groove of the novel and was able to piece things together as I went along.  I believe this is how Atwood meant it to be as she shifts back and forth in time.  We begin with what seems like an armageddon scenario and, by the end of the book, understand how it came to be.<br />The author seems to have a fixation on how genetic engineering will be the cause of the fall of mankind.  Essentially, the message is passed along that, if we create a health system that preserves us all, then we'll have to find some other way to destroy ourselves.  (At least that's what I got out of the book).  Along the way, Atwood has her usual keen insight to how we all interact with one another as well as how our inner thoughts seem to work.  I admit that I was left wondering if I had missed a bigger theme but I was content with the one I detected.<br />To my knowledge, Margaret Atwood has never written a bad book although I never read her poetry or essays.  Sometimes the story line isn't as interesting or absorbing as others but there is always a lot to pick up on along the way.  This book got better as I kept reading but then it ended rather abruptly.  I believe the author left it up to us to figure out the way it should properly end.  Read it and see what you think.	2004-01-01

This time he's vacationing in the South Seas while taking a break from the mental anguish of watching his mother slowly pass on.  We start with a lot of family history and assume that this will be the theme.  Then we go off in a different tangent as the book becomes something of a cynical tourist guide to the Marquesa Islands.  Ultimately we find ourselves at a very appropriate ending.  <br />This book, even more so than the other two aforementioned books, is something of a free verse of observations by the author.  One comes away wondering why this book was written and I guess my impression that it was more for the author than for us.  We are able to follow, somewhat, McMurtry's attempts to resolve some of his inner feelings as he knows his mother is slowly drifting away (albeit several thousand miles away).  Yet at the same time, his observations about his trip and fellow travelers confuse us as to the depth of any of his feelings.  Perhaps that is the point; a man who is at one of those points in life where life itself is a numbing sensation.  <br />Should you read this book?  Probably not unless you, like many of McMurtry's literary aficionados, enjoy getting to know the author a bit better.  Otherwise it is just a journal of a trip.  And it's a trip that the reader has to feel would have been more enjoyable if we rather than McMurtry were the ones taking it.  Nonetheless, I'm glad I read it.	2003-12-13

Sometimes the local paper would run one, other times my parents, who lived in LA, would send me a copy of a particularly good one.  Murray had a way with words and when he wrote in praise of an athlete or a team, there was no greater compliment they could have received.  One day I came across &quot;The Best of Jim Murray&quot; and figured that this would be a great treat to read.  I started at the beginning and kept reading.  I gradually came to the realization that Jim Murray wrote the same collumn all his life.  He merely changed the proper nouns and action verbs where ever necessary.  The more I read the more I felt like I was reading the same thing over and over.  That isn't necessarily bad; Jeff Foxworthy tells a different variation of the same joke over and over and it's still funny.  My mistake was reading the book from cover to cover instead of two or three collumns a week.  After all, that's how the LA Times readers absorbed his writings.  This was the book that taught me to not read collected works like any other book.  Instead, I enjoy a story or two at a time in between the other books I read.  Had I done that with this book, I'm sure I would have rated it higher.	2003-12-07

Many will recall a Robert Redford movie of the same title some years ago.  The stories are well-written and it is not surprizing to learn that the author was a University of Chicago English professor.  They take place in a time period shortly after WWI when the author was a young man.    <br />The title story tells of the author's recollections of fishing with his brother.  Avid fly-fishermen will especially enjoy this piece although there is plenty in it for everyone.  His brother was a somewhat rough character (or, at least, he associated with rough characters).  We meet a number of &quot;rough&quot; characters in these stories through the eyes of the not-so-rough author.  I found this to be an interesting way to become acquainted with these individuals; something like what used to be called &quot;slumming&quot;.  In all the stories amid all the rough and tumble people and activities, we always get a good sence of the author's respect and appreciation of nature.  Sometimes it's hard to tell whether nature is interfering with the action or vice versa.  <br />The second story is about a man the author worked with in the Forest Service.  This man saws trees in the summer and pimps in the winter.  Again we get an interesting look at the sort of person we're not likely to run into ourselves.<br />The final story tells of a group of Forest Service employees who work a long summer together and then head into town in the Fall to make a killing at the poker table.  They have a system all set up and we watch as the author takes us through a pretty wild night on the town.  In the end, the author's mates return to their job and the author heads out in a more civilized direction.<br />I enjoyed this book as I also enjoyed &quot;Young Men and Fire&quot;.  The latter books advertized that it was written by the author of &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;.  Maybe it was because of the movie.  Personally, I think that any future editions of &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot; should be advertized as being written by the author of &quot;Young Men and Fire&quot;.  The latter was the better book although both are very good.  In either book the author takes us to a place that had an important effect on him and gives us a sense of why that was.	2003-12-01

However, it was also a  significant battle in the US Civil War.  As the title suggests, it took place in June, 1864 and was part of Sherman's advance on Atlanta.  What makes this book a cut above most of the rest of the many Civil War books is the author's heavy reliance on first-person accounts of the battle.  Richard Baumgartner has made extensive use of letters, diaries, journals, memoirs, and the like to essentially let them tell the story.  He does a masterful job of weaving them together with just enough of his own writing to keep things going in the right direction.  He has editted in some fascinating accounts and personal recollections.  They are informative as well as touchingly personal.  He also fills us in with some helpful biographical information and follow up information on what later happened to some of his &quot;contributors&quot;.  In the end we are left with a very up-close look at a battle that shouldn't have happened and an excellent understanding of why.<br />If I have a criticism of the book it is with the annotation on its' cover, &quot;Illustrated with 175 Wartime Photographs&quot;.  Well over 90% of these are individual and group portraits with very little of the battlefield itself.  As a final, personal note, I bought this book to read more about a battle my great great grandfather was in.  It was with great pleasure that I found him quoted along with the many other participants.  I mention this because it fits the general feeling I got that reading this book acquaints the reader with a great many &quot;real&quot; people.	2003-11-29

I was reminded of the essential differences between appeasement and the need to take agressive measures to stop agression.  William Manchester does an outstanding job of spelling out the state of the world at this time leading up to World War II.  He details, from a British perspective, every move as we watch disappointedly from an historical vantage point.  Churchill's eventual elevation to Prime Minister comes not as a triumph, but more like an act of desperation.  All along the way, knowing who the bad guy is (and just how bad he really is) we are disappointed (or is it disgusted) at each step of retreat.  <br />I am in the midst of reading Shirer's \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" and, while I can sing it's praises, it does not do as impressive job on this subject as Manchester's \\"Alone\\".  Someting about Manchester's writing makes you feel that you're in the midst of everything that's happening.  <br />I can think of no better a time to read this book than in the present world political situation.  I'll leave it to the reader to decided how similar the Iraq situation is to that of Nazi Germany.  However, the various ways the world and this country react to the situation brings Europe of the 1930's to mind.	2003-11-27

(We might we ask, who was the greatest person of the 20th Century since this was the century that gave us reason to be inclusive with the question).  I'm sure I echo the thoughts of many when I suugest that the answer is easy: Winston Churchill.  Rather than make my case here, I would direct you to read Manchester's biography of the man, &quot;The Last Lion&quot;.<br />William Manchester set out to write the biography of Winston Churchill and found that it was not going to fit neatly into one volume.  We have, in &quot;The Last Lion:Visions of Glory&quot; the first of, presumably 3 or 4 volume.  This is quite an undertaking.  For me, the prospect of reading so large a book just to get the facts on the first third of a man's life seemed pretty intimidating.  I left this book on the shelf for a number of years.  Finally, I decided to give it a shot and I immediately found myself immersed in the early years of Churchill.  There really is plenty to write about this man and Manchester is just the person to handle the job.  I found this book not only hard to put down, when I finished it I got started right away on the second volume; &quot;Alone&quot;.  I have been waiting patiently while the author continues to age.  I have tried to ignore the rumors that there will be no further output from Manchester.  Such is the quality of his writing and his thoroughness that this biography ranks at the apex of 20th Century historical writing.  Read this book and the second volume and you, too, will demand its' proper conclusion.	2003-11-25

You are 1000 miles from the nearest land, you have had no food or water for days, one of your members is near death,...is there a potential temporary solution to your problem?  Reading this on a full stomach, some solutions just might not present themselves.  However, in &quot;The Custom of the Sea&quot;, the author, Neil Hanson, allows us to see things from the perspective of those involved.  The solution that those men took that fateful day is the basis for a most interesting look at a most unusual footnote in history.<br />Hanson tells the tale primarily through the eyes of the main character but he gives us plenty of background on all of the other characters and events that culminated in a major trial in England in the late 1800's.  Along the way, the author gives us historical background as well which I generally found to be helpful.  Essentially, half of the 304 pages are focussed on the actual events and the other half are focussed on the resulting trial.  That might sound like half is exciting and half is boring (or, at least, less exciting).  However, there is a major moral and legal dilemna here and the trial helps to bring out those issues.  <br />All in all, this is a very good book, easily read, and hard to put down.  If I am to fault the author for anything, it is his openly biased account of the events.  We know right off the bat who the good guys are; we hear only good things about them and we hear only bad things about the &quot;bad guys&quot;.  For example, we are told of the happily married men (good guys)and then we are told about another who is &quot;rumored&quot; to have abandoned a wife and children.  This &quot;rumor&quot; is never proven but it is brought up several times in the story.  I mention this because there are serious moral questions involved in these events.  As such, the author ought to put forth the facts as impartially as possible so as to let the reader decide their own opinions.  We were led in the &quot;right&quot; direction by Neil Hanson's way of telling the story.  Still, most of us might have eventually ended up with similar sympathies.  Read &quot;The Custom of the Sea&quot; and ask yourself what you would have done in the same situation.	2003-11-16

His books waste little time before you get right into the action and then there's action all the way through to the end.  I can't remember how many of his books I eventually read; there was &quot;Puppet on a Chain&quot;, &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot;, &quot;Force 10 from Navarone&quot;, &quot;The Satan Bug&quot;, etc. etc. etc..  About the time I was reading &quot;River of Death&quot; I realized that all the excitement in his books didn't always make up for the hasty way in which he seemed to write them.  The tough guy with no personality eventually lost my interest.  In my opinion, &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; was his best work.  Maybe it was the World War II setting that gave it added appeal.  He didn't have to waste any paragraphs establishing the cause or who were the good guys and who were the bad.  Whatever it was, I remember feeling like I needed to take a deep breath when I was finished with it.<br />It's too bad that literature and spellbinding adventure rarely come together in one book.  I remember reading Henry James's &quot;thriller&quot; &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; when I was a teenager.  That book put me to sleep trying to drag myself through it.  Action has no time for character development.  Some books make you want to stop and think while others make you want to keep turning the pages.  I used to enjoy Alstair MacLean's novels.  I would heartily recommend them to any young man who's looking for excitement in a paperback.	2003-10-25
US	40051756	R2RE5LI4YUDHQO	0020306652	778679666	Ball Four: Twentieth Anniversary Edition	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Iconoclast on the Pitching Mound	I read this book when it first came out.  It was quite an eye-opener although it may seem tame by today's standards.  There was, we were told, an unwritten (and in some cases WRITTEN) rule that what happens in the club house stays in the club house.  Jim Bouton certainly trashed that maxim as well as a lot of other sacred icons in &quot;Ball Four&quot;.  In the process he became more famous for his writing than he ever was for his pitching.  <br />This book is actually a diary of a pitcher's season.  Bouton was a flame-throwing pitcher for the Yankees but he blew out his arm when he was still relatively young.  He attempted to come back as a knuckle ball pitcher with the Seattle Pilots (remember them?).  Pitching on an expansion team in its' first year gave Bouton an interesting perspective.  Afterall, his previous service in the majors involved pitching in the World Series for the almighty Yankees.  He went from a great team to a lousy team; from being a very good pitcher to a slightly below mediocre pitcher. With this background, the author shares what it was like to be at the top and what it is like to be at the bottom.  We go day to day through the season.  Bouton critiques his various pitching performances as well as the rest of the expansion team.  Much of the book is hilarious, especially the parts about his manager, Joe Schultz.  It is, however, Bouton's comments about his former Yankee teammates that have ruffled so many feathers.  For example, he ponders how many more home runs Mickey Mantle would have gotten if he hadn't come to so many games hungover.  Well, so much for Bouton being invited to Old-timer's games at Yankee Stadium.  Yet his book is tame compared to today's slash and burn sports reporters.  Mickey actually comes across as a loveable hero rather than the tragic figure many later portayed him as.<br />Many people have tried to portray the life of a major league athlete.  Most have made it too complicated or glamorous.  Bouton's version stillstands out as the best.  He makes it sound like fun.  You'll have fun, too, if you read &quot;Ball Four&quot;.	2003-10-24

At least that is the tone I got from reading his autobiography.  He hits the ground arguing and never lets up.  In the process, we get a good look at a career that spans Ty Cobb to Cesar Cedeno with plenty in between.  This book is a must for Baseball history buffs.  As a matter of fact, I think it helps if you ARE a Baseball history buff because you might know more about a number of the controversies that Durocher talks about.  I was not familiar with a lot of the controversies he wrote about.  However, that didn't detract from the book but neither did it add to my enjoyment of it.  You come to understand early on that it is not coincidental that Durocher encountered so many controversies in his career.  These include controversies surrounding his relationships with his players, his general managers, his owners, the umpires, his real or alleged off-field associations, as well as with various Baseball Commissioners.  There is even a controvery or two surrounding his wives although, in fairness, it has more to do with their relationships with their former spouses than with him.  In that regard, this is not a &quot;kiss and tell&quot; book.  It's more a &quot;now that you've heard everybody else's version, here's my side of the story&quot; book.  That's the problem with this book.  Although Durocher acknowledges occassional short-comings, he seems to always be &quot;set-up&quot; by others to look like the bad guy.  After a few dozen of his &quot;corrections of the record&quot; you come away feeling that this man may have had a hard time with the facts.  <br />Durocher may be apologetic at times but his brash manner, that he never waivers from, emboldens him to give some surprizing frank observations about some icons of the game.  He is polite but critical of Jackie Robinson (didn't work hard enough), Ernie Banks (too slow and too lame to be of much good to the team), and Ron Santo (whom he portrays as a crybaby) to mention a few.  He has his heroes such as Willie Mays whom he considered the greatest player he ever saw.  He has two people that he puts at a level just a notch under Mays; Pete Reiser whose career was shortened by injuries and Cesar Cedeno whom he (typically) detracts in the same sentence he praises.  However, the star of this book is Leo Durocher (fair enough, it's his autobiography).  Although it was &quot;co-written&quot; with Ed Linn, the book read like a non-stop monologue by Durocher.  The book was copyrighted in 1975 but it has stood the test of time.  His comments on the high salaries of the 1970's may sound ridiculous compared to what has happened since then.  However, his comments are still valid (when adjusted for inflation).  Once I got started on the book, I found it hard to put down.  I also found it hard to think I was getting the full story.	2003-10-14

It is a collection of short stories including the title story.  The book I'm rating a &quot;5&quot; here is not necessarily the same book.  However, since each and every story was a joy to read, I believe that it is safe to recommend any collection of Pirandello short stories.  The stories all take place in a rural Scicilian setting and they have the local flavor seasoned all through out.  There is usually either a moral to the story, an implied deeper meaning, or an ironic twist.  Among my favorites in &quot;The Naked Truth&quot; were the stories &quot;The Annuity&quot;, &quot;The Wayside Shrine&quot;, &quot;The Wax Madonna&quot;, &quot;The Red Booklet&quot;, &quot;The Fly&quot;, and &quot;The Benediction&quot;.  <br />I initially picked up this book just to read a selection or two.  Once I was midway through the first story, I was hooked.  I have read other, longer works of the author and I enjoyed them.  However, they were not as good as his short stories.  I am looking forward to finding more of his short stories.	2003-10-02

It is a story of a teenage boy at a time shortly after the Civil War.  He has some adventures in his Missouri hamlet before his mother has the family take off for Wyoming in search of her husband.  There are a number of characters that weave in and out of the story but the focus is on the family.  Fortunately, there are not any of the bizarre characters that we have come to expect in McMurtry's latter works.  Most of the characters are fairly normal and interesting.  In fact, the book reads like a reminiscence written from years later.  It seems like a cross between &quot;I Remember Mama&quot; and &quot;My Life on the Plains&quot;.  Something is happening all the time in this book.  I started worrying as I got near the end because I was sure I would run out of pages before I finished the story.  There is a lot here that the author could have fleshed out some more.  However, the brevity that leaves us wanting more is always preferable to the opposite.  For a minimal investment of time, this is a good way to spend an afternoon.	2003-09-13

However, I really had to struggle to get through this collection of Monologues by Sholem Aleichem.  I found them hard to stay focussed on and I don't know whether to blame myself, the translator, or the works themselves.  Some years back I read another collection of Aleichem's works titled &quot;Old Country Tales&quot;.  My favorite part of those stories were the ones called &quot;Monologues&quot;.  In it, Aleichem has characters go on and on talking about some subject or other.  The slang, the inflection, the rambling on and off topic all create a very enjoyable and very ethnic impression.  Although they fit the same format, I just didn't enjoy these selections.  I have no credentials to blame it on the translator although they did not seem to read nearly as smooth as the previous ones I read.  I was under the impression that some or many of these monologues were appearing in English for the first time.  Could it be that the best was translated long ago and these were deemed lesser quality and so were only recently translated?  I did enjoy the last three selections but, by then, I was just trying to finish the book.  I previously read four other books by Aleichem and I thoroughly enjoyed them all.  This one was a complete turnaround.	2003-09-02

Heinz on Sports	Books	4	6	6	N	N	A Very Pleasant Surprize	My father sent me this book when he was done reading it.  I, frankly, had never heard of the author but I noted with interest that he was a sportswriter and had contributed to writing M*A*S*H*.  I came across some of his stories in a different collection and discovered that this man can write.  This book starts out with a number of profiles of different sports figures.  Some are very famous (Red Grange, Stan Musial, and Sugar Ray Robinson) while others are very obscure (ever hear of Bummy Davis, Pete Reiser,or Jack Hurley?).  Some of the profiles are heart-warming while others are heart-breaking; Heinz can handle either direction with skill.  There is another section with selections from his works of fiction.  This includes &quot;The Red Raiders of the Imjin&quot; which is where the football game in the movie M*A*S*H* comes from.  The last section has a number of newpaper articles from over the years.  The author's insights on boxing, baseball, football, and horse-racing shows that he really knows his stuff.  He may not be a modern sportswriter but, from what I've read, he must have influenced a lot of the modern crowd.  This was a very plesant surprize.  Thanks Dad.	2003-08-30

I finally picked it up with a casual attitude but was quickly given an attitude adjustment.  This book is an excellent collection of essays that read more like short stories.  The subject matter is quite varied but they all concern US history either directly or indirectly. Many of the subjects concern famous people and/or events while others focus on the obscure people and events of our history.  One of my favorites was a biographical sketch of L. Frank Baum in which I discovered that &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; was just one of many books about that magical land.  Other essays were about inventions, weather phenomena, social issues, etc.  All of the essays were well written by a wide assortment of historians.  It really was like reading a collection of short stories that just happened to be informative as well as engrossing.  I was reminded of this book when I saw a book club offering it as a selection.  I thought it was out of print but I'm glad to see it's going to be available again.  It certainly was pleasure to read.	2003-08-30

As the turn of the century neared, I was looking for some great perspectives on literature in the 20th Century.  I'm still looking.  Outside of the Modern Library' list of the 100 best English Language books of the 20th Century, I haven't seen much.  That's too bad because, for me, the literature of the last century is the best compared to all other centuries.  One book that has been a good perspective on 20th Century Literature is &quot;Books of the Century&quot; compiled by the editors of the New York &quot;Times&quot; Book Review.  They got a bit of a head start on the turn of the century because they were celebrating their 100 years of reviewing books; 100 years that began in 1896.  What the editors put together is a chronological selection of their reviews over the years.  Of course, most of the selections are from either titles or authors that are well known to most of us.  It is interesting to read contemporary reviews of books many decades old.  What bothered me as I read through this books is the repeated appearances of letters, essays, and interviews that seemed to me to take up space best reserved for more book reviews.  I admit that I enjoyed some of the letters (especially William Manchester's on H.L. Mecken), interviews (especially with I.B. Singer in 1978), and essays (especially Marquez on Hemingway).  However, the title of the book suggested a more focussed work.  I found myself skimming more and more as I went on.  The final 143 pages is a yearly synopsis of the editors' choice of the best books from 1972-1997.<br />I am glad That the editors put this book out and I am glad that I read it.  However, I would have preferred a summation of the editor's choice of the best books from 1896-1997 rather than the synopsis that they gave of the last 26 years.	2003-08-24

Of course, she was wrong, \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" had been written over 80 years earlier at that time.  It will forever hold that title in American Literature even if some fail to comprehend that fact.  However, if my old English teacher ever read \\"Lonesome Dove\\", I'll bet she was satisfied that the job had finally been accomplished.  This novel has all of the elements of the epic novel and it is uniquely American in its' subject and its' scope.  It tells the tale of a journey in the American West of a group of men (cowboys) who travel from the southern end of our country to the northern end.  Along the way they encounter great adventures that are uniquely American while also essentially American.  The two main heroes lead the way and suffer the fates that often befall men of greatness.  The interweaving of characters and events tells the story of America.  Such magnitude and such endless excitement and insight comes along rarely in literature so it is no wonder that Larry McMurtry won the Pulitzer Prize for his book.  My paperback copy has 945 pages but all I recall is that I couldn't put it down.  Many by now have seen the excellent made-for-TV movie but, believe me, the book is so much better.	2003-08-23

Once I read it, it became one of my all time favorites.  It is a heartwarming story about friendship and the extent to which one man will go to help another.  Mind you, this isn't a story about one man laying down his life for another.  That sort of heroism belongs in a different class altogether.  Fortunately, most of us don't find ourselves in those situations.  However, all of us, in one way or another, will likely find ourselves in a situation similar to the one that Henry Wiggen finds himself in.  Henry's teammate, Bruce Pearson, is a borderline major league catcher who discovers, over the winter, that he has a terminal disease.  Henry, an all-star major league pitcher, is the only non-family member who knows this secret.  The relationship between Henry and Bruce is not one of best friends.  The relationship is based more on the fact that Henry has sold Bruce a life insurance policy (which is what the pitcher does in the off-season).  As such, Bruce, somewhat limited in intelligence, puts a special sort of trust in Henry.  Although it would be easy to dismiss this trust as misguided, Henry takes the full responsibility for it and puts his own career on the line in doing so.  In fact, he puts both careers on the line for his teammate and does it all so that Bruce's last year on Earth is a meaningful one.  See how the little secret becomes a rallying cry for an under-achieving team.  The ending is poignant in many ways but our hero is there to the end.  <br />Unless you've got ice water in your veins, this book will touch you deeply.  As you read it, ask yourself, &quot;Would I have done the same thing?&quot;  The honest answer for most of us, unfortunately, is no.	2003-08-21

It was the last of the three WWII books by Ryan that I read (the others were &quot;The Longest Day&quot; and &quot;The Last Battle&quot;).  It also was and is the best of the three.  There is something extra about this book that seems to bring the reader even closer to the scene of action.  As usual, Cornelius Ryan does an excellent job of interviewing a wide range of participants and observers and then weaving together a story that allows us to follow the action step by step; sometimes minute by minute.  Unfortunately, the author can only report history; he can't change it.  Market Garden still remains a failed mission and Ryan helps us to understand just why.  There is plenty of detail here but it reads like a novel rather than a history.  This is as engrossing account of any event in WWII as you will find.	2003-08-20

There are some works that seem more of an exploitive nature but mostly each work is another opportunity to try and understand the incomprehendable.  Numbers tend to numb but first person accounts bring to life the insanity that was and is the Holocaust.  In &quot;Night&quot;, Elie Wiesel does as good a job as anyone in giving us a glimpse of life in a death camp.  What stands out is how well he is able to say so much with such brevity.  Every sentence has its' purpose and every character his as well.  There are many unforgetable passages.  One I recall tells of a fellow prisoner who spoke of loading corpses and discovering he was loading his own father.  That and many other images will stay with me forever.  This book should be read by all.	2003-08-19

Consider the plot.  A teenage girl discovers that her parents stole her from another family when she was an infant.  She discovers this, more or less, as the result of meeting her twin sister.  They become acquainted with one another and even confuse a young man who couldn't keep track of who was who.  There is certainly a lot that can be done with that concept.  Yet in Yasunari Kawabata's highly acclaimed novel, the reader is given the sense that there is no shock when the main character discovers these thing.  Indeed, there seems to be more emotion expended over the selection for a Kimono pattern.  I found myself enjoying the novel yet trying to comprehend this radically different perspective on life.  I haven't figured out the Japanese mind as yet but \\"The Old Capital\\" is another step along what has proven to be an interesting journey to find out.	2003-08-16

I did so because my vacation was taking me through Fredricksburg and Gettysburg and I planned to visit the three battlefields talked about in this book.  While I had hoped for an historical background of the battles, I received so much more.  I had not realized that Bruce Catton was such an excellent writer.  I just assumed that he was another Civil War buff who was a bit more successful than his peers.  How wrong I was!  What comes through most clearly from Catton's writing in his respect and admiration of the foot soldiers of the Army of the Potomac.  What comes through nearly as well is his ability to explain the circumstances of the times; what was happening in Washington, what was happening in the homefront, who were these men in charge.  Finally, what is also very appreciated by the reader is the detailed overview of the three main battles in the book; Fredricksburg, Chancellorsille, and Gettysburg.  What I mean by detailed overview is not the minute by minute account that so many battle histories have.  Rather it is an overview that allows the reader a clear understanding of how the battle proceeded with focal points throughout the event to better bring it to life.  Mr. Catton seasons all of this with some much appreciated philosophy of the meaning of the events that take place.  <br />I am aware that I have just finished reading a masterpiece.  What is embarassing for me to consider is that it sat on my bookshelf for several years.  I will see to it that Vols I and III shall be attended to promptly.	2003-08-14

I was heading out to a vacation in the South and decided to take along &quot;An Honorable Defeat&quot;.  It was a wise choice because it gave me an interesting perspective about the last days of the Confederacy.  It also gave me some perspective about the history of some of the places I travelled through.  I found the book very well-written and I certainly enjoyed the author's portrait of the main characters.  Jefferson Davis comes across as a very aloof leader who was incapable of surrender when there was at least the promise of some Confederates still in uniform.  The hero of the book is General John C. Breckinridge who comes across as the man who SHOULD have led the Conderacy because of his insight and leadership.  We are introduced to the other leaders of the Confederacy as well who offer a wide array of personalities.  This is the story of the end.  It essentially begins with Lee's surrender and we follow the Confederate government as it moves further and further south looking for an army or armies that will lead it in another attempt at glory.  Breckinridge sees the futility but Jefferson Davis doesn't.  As they continue their journey, their ranks steadily shrink until they are vulnerable even to their own Rebel stragglers who know that they carry the remaining treasury of the Confederacy. In a sense it is a tragedy but we can't bring ourselves to cheer for the likes of President Davis.  I found it a very informative book that picks up on the history that most people think ended with Appomattox.  The problem is like that of many Civil War books; it is saturated with detail.  In the case of &quot;An Honorable Defeat&quot;, the problem is somewhat offset by the skilled writing of the author.  This book reads almost like a novel.  However, we learn more than we need to in order to know what we need to.  True Civil War buffs probably already knew much of this but the rest of us can learn a lot by reading this book.	2003-08-13

I read what I could about him and, of course, did my best to see all of his movies.  Over the years my interest in movies expanded to include other actors and subjects.  At the same time, the late night TV movies showed fewer and fewer &quot;old&quot; movies so my Bogart movies seemed limited to &quot;CasaBlanca&quot; and &quot;The African Queen&quot;.  Not a bad couple of movies to watch but too limited to live out my Bogart mania.  Thus I looked forward to reading &quot;The Ultimate Bogart&quot; when I saw it in the book store.  I enjoyed how it brought back my enthusism for one of cinema's great actors.  However, I felt that the book was overloaded with too much trivia; especially the unneccessary information about the expansion of Bogart's legend after his death.  The author categorizes his chapters which has the unfortunate affect of repeating a lot of information that fits into more than one such category.  What we come up short on is more information of a biographical nature.  There is a great filmography and Bogarts fans will enjoy the trivia tests.  There is also a very good bibliography.  However, I can't recall the last time I got excited over a bibliography.<br />This is a book for Bogart fans but they will already know most of the information.  At least they will have a guide now as to where to turn for more.	2003-08-12

It isn't so much of a travel book as a &quot;thoughts on traveling&quot; book.  The author starts with a trip from Duluth to his home in Northern Texas and he does this in two days with time to spare.  In other words, no time to stop and look around.  However, there is time to reflect on past experiences associated with various places he passes.  That is the interesting aspect of the book.  The author, Larry McMurtry had read a lot of books, known a lot of people, and had a lot of experiences.  We enjoy just a smattering of them in this book.  There are some helpful tips here and there.  For example, I am happy that we'll be traveling through Kansas City next week on a Sunday; McMurtry makes it sound overly challenging just about any other time of the week.  However, the observations far outweigh the information.  Still, the author's observations are worth our time.  <br />The author concludes his book with a last trip from Seattle to Omaha.  I had started this book the week before but I'd only gotten a few pages into it.  A long trip from our home on the Western border of North Dakota to a hockey camp in Grand Forks on the Eastern border of the state gave me an opportunity to do some reading.  Thus I took along this book, my 11 year old hockey player and his 16 year old sister who did most of the driving while I read.  Meanwhile, McMurtry's trip from Seattle has led him to observe that &quot;...I realized that I had found paradise.  For connoisseurs of prairie travel, US 2 is the perfect road-the road into the spacious heart of the plains.&quot;  What an experience!  Here I'd read of all his travels out east, out west and elsewhere and the book ends with an ode to the very road I'd been traveling on while reading it.  What's more, I was reading this part while on the very stretch that he was writing about.  Well, I obviously have a high praise for this book as a result of that!  I sobered myself up to rate it a 4 instead of the tempting 5.  For the record, my 16 year old says that McMurtry's comments about US 2 are evidence that he's nuts.  I, on the other hand, came to appreciate why I drive 300-400 miles in state to attend meetings.  Back home in Iowa (where I grew up), if it was over 125 miles away then it must not be that important.  <br />This book reminds me of McMurtry's &quot;Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen&quot;.  That, too, was a book of observations centered around general topics.  This is a good writer to converse with even if he is doing all the talking.	2003-07-08

In finishing &quot;Short Friday&quot;, I have now read all books in English by the author Isaac Bashevis Singer.  I guess there are some children's books of his that I haven't read yet and there is always the hope of some new works of his being translated from Yiddish to English.  However, I don't know what sort of literary estate he has left behind so I will have to content myself with reading everything over again.  <br />As for &quot;Short Friday&quot;, this was a good collection of some of the many short stories Isaac B. Singer has written over the years.  I would rate it a 4.5 if there were such a choice on the scale.  About half of the stories in this volumne deal with the supernatural which is a populat subject of the author's.  There is a wonderful little story of spiritual devotion in &quot;I Place my Reliance on No Man&quot;.  The title story is a moving tale of love at the end of life.  However, the masterpiece of this book is the story &quot;Yentl the Yeshiva Boy&quot;.  I had read this story in the &quot;Collected Short Stories of Isaac Singer&quot; but it was well worth reading again.  Many people may be familiar with the Barbara Streisand movie &quot;Yentl&quot; which is based on this story of a young woman who pretends to be a young man so that she can study the holy books.  It is one of the author's best works.<br />Well, every collection of short stories by Singer is a joy to read because you never know what's coming next.  This is one of the better collections and a good place to begin if you haven't read anything by the author before.  On the other hand, it's not a bad one to finish with if you've already read everything else I.B. Singer has written.	2003-07-01

I found myself only able to devote short periods of time to read it.  It was amazing how much I was able to get out of even two or three pages read at a time.  The author, through his main character covers so much about so many things in such a short number of pages (278).  There is a plot and there is an overall message but there are so many things that weave themselves in and out of the story that I am sure that this book will mean different things to different people.  <br />The main character is an individual of Asian background whose family has lived elsewhere in the African continent.  He moves to a remoter part of Central Africa after purchasing a store in a community of modest size.  The country is in a time of political strife.  The political perspective of the book is certainly an interesting one.  There is a relationship with a woman that becomes the focus for awhile until it ends in a most deplorable way.  Ultimately our narrator must leave.  <br />I came away from this book with an appreciation for the perspective of an outsider living in a different culture.  It was, perhaps, that perspective that give the narrator such a detached view of the world.  He interacts with all but seems to truly care about no one.  Others may disagree, but I felt the detachment more than any other aspect of the book.  Based on this introduction to V S Naipaul, I am anxious to read more by this recent Nobel winner.	2003-06-22

That book was a collection of memories of men long since gone about a time in Baseball even longer gone.  There was a reverence apparent in the recollections of those men that conveyed an image of a game uncorrupted by modern outside distractions.  Of course, the iron rule of the owners and the &quot;whites only&quot; standard are just two contradictions to that image.  However, there was a poetry to &quot;The Glory of Their Times&quot; that stays with you and clouds away those inconsistencies.<br />&quot;We Played the Game&quot; concerns a more recent time with the recollections of retired players, many of whom are still with us.  It has the first-person history that &quot;Glory&quot; has but they apply to events that many people still recall.  Where &quot;The Glory of Their Times&quot; is poetic, &quot;We Played the Game&quot; is active and interactive.  It follows each season in each league through the eyes of at least one player on that team.  There were 65 retired players who contributed their recollections.  Due to the different tenures, military service, and trades, there are some teams in some years without a first-hand perspective.  However, there are very few such omissions.  The greatness of this is how the reader comes to taste the whole season in each year and in each league.  Not just from the point of view of who won but also from the point of view of who lost.  There's a lot of history in this book and it reads very well.  Take one season at a time and enjoy a more vivid picture of the past than any newsreel would ever show you.	2003-06-20

Interesting is about the nicest thing I can think to say about Billy Martin.  Although his exploits have been legendary, the stuff in this book takes it too a new level.  According to the author, Pete Golenbock, Martin has several women going in different cities at the same time.  He was supporting an underage girl and her family on the West Coast and engaged on the East Coast.  His life, as portrayed in this book, was more out of control than you suspected.  Golenbeck caters to our interest in these areas and with life on the field, in the club house and in the owners office.  You have to catch your breath periodically when reading about the life of Billy Martin.<br />On the negative side, the book turns into a defense of the person traveling with Martin the day of his fatal accident.  You'll recall that Christmas Day story that told how his friend from Detroit was behind the wheel when it happened.  You may recall later on (after consulting with his lawyer, no doubt) the driver suddenly became the passenger.  Strangely, the lone eyewitness decided he was actually sitting elswhere in the vehicle after he had time to think about it.  Along comes Golenbock to the rescue with photos, medical reports and diagrams showing how Billy was actually the driver.  Sorry, I'm not that interested.  Let the courts decide that one.  The book should have been shorter than it was.  I came away with the idea that intimate information was shared with the author in return for his public defense of Martin's passenger/chaffeur.  It was a disjointed way to end the otherwise interesting book.  But then, Martin's death was a disjointed way to end an otherwise interesting life.	2003-06-19

He was so dedicated to the profession that he and his wife honeymooned at a ranger tower.  In time he switched to a more stable profession but I could always see the gleam in his eye when he talked about parachuting into remote forests to put out fires.  When \\"Young Men and Fire\\" came out, I bought it mainly because of my friend and because of some surprizingly good reviews I had read of it.  I was unaware of the literary reputation of the author.  I must say, I was impressed with this book.<br />It is a story of one man's search for meaning in a tragic disaster that took the lives of over a dozen young men.  They were fire fighters who would parachute into remote corners of America to put out forest fire and they were known as \\"smoke jumpers\\".  On that day, like any other previous assignment, they were flown to a site and parachuted down to do their work.  there was a sudden burst of wind and flame that almost immediately engulfed all but a couple of the men.  It was a freak accident of nature and not much could have been done to avoid it.  As a matter of fact, a very similar event occurred in Colorado 6 or 7 years ago with similar loss of life. <br />With a survivor's sense of \\"Why did I survive?\\" Norman Maclean sought to find out why the two men DID survive.  He was able to reach a scientific answer but not a philosophical one.  This was obviously something that the author was obsessed with and he brings us into his obsession.  He lays out a lot of the basic information.  He takes us through the events of that day as meticulously as possible and he then goes over it again and again.  Rather than an unnecessary bunch of repetition, I took this as an opportunity to search the author's soul.  Why was this so important to him?  Why could he not let go of it?  In the end, we are left with an intimate knowledge of something worth knowing about and an appreciation for an author's eloquent effort to honor 15 men who set out one day to do a job.	2003-06-17

I would give &quot;Rising Tide&quot; a 4.5 star rating were that a choice because there was so much to enjoy in its' scope.  I remember a good introduction to the efforts to control the Mighty Mississippi.  I remember the plight of Greenville, Mississippi and many other communities along the river.  However, I remember the situation in Louisiana most of all.  There the City of New Orleans made a deal with some of the lesser populated Cajun parishes to flood their land in order to save the city.  The deal had a devastating affect on the Cajuns and was largely forgotten by the city fathers of New Orleans.  These vignettes stand out because the author, John Barry, has a reporters sense of weaving vital facts in with human interest stories to give an inside look to an important yet largely forgotten event in American History.<br />Everybody has his or her favorite body of water.  For many it's an ocean, for some a lake or a trout stream.  For me it has always been the Mississippi River.  Ever since I first saw it as a child, I was impressed.  Even though I have lived by the confluence of the Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers for the last 22 years, I have not changed my opinion.  The vast expanse and power of this river is truly something to behold.  &quot;Rising Tide&quot; is worthy of its' subject and that is saying a lot.	2003-06-17

It was the first large novel that I tried to tackle and I have been grateful ever since that I gave it a try.  The author, Theodore Dreiser, led me through the early life of the main character, Clyde Griffiths.  We see him focussing on becoming a moderate success in life.  He discovers the benefits of hard work and a little luck.  In time he finds himself with a nice job in up-state New York.  He seems to be set and starts dating one of his fellow factory workers.  Their romance seems headed in the right direction but gets ahead of schedule as she becomes pregnant.  Bad timing, because Clyde has just caught the eye of the bosses beautiful daughter.  This is the 1920's so current relaxed standards and current debatable solutions were not in vogue at the time.  Clyde sees a bright future that will evaporate with the birth of his first-born.  What to do?  Well, certainly not what Clyde chose to do.  <br />The question is, what IS the American Tragedy?  I believe that Dreiser meant it to be the pitfalls of Capitalism.  I believe that he was a Socialist at heart and probably in practice.  Many a reader will come away with this sentiment as well.  However, the irony to me is that it is a uniquely American tragedy because Clyde was a kid from nowhere who had the opportunity to rise to the upper levels.  I realize that there were family contacts and that his next boost was going to come from marrying the bosses daughter.  However, in European society of his time, neither of these options were even possible.  The problem for Clyde is that he focussed more on what he could become than on who he should be.  This is a story about avarice and how it can blind an otherwise reasonable person.  It is a message that is worldwide in a setting that IS very American.	2003-06-16

I read it over 35 years ago when it was the latest Newbery Award winner.  I was totally captivated by the adventure, the tragedy, the survival, and the companionship of a dog.<br />  Although the main character is a teenage girl, the role fits either gender (which is an important consideration for a teenage reader). This young lady goes from a life in paradise to a life in a lonely castle.  Her family and her people are all killed off and she, ultimately, is left with only her dog to pass the years away.  Yet, as dreary as it sounds, the story is one of joy and achievement.  Indeed, it is somewhat of an anticlimax when the girl is finally rescued and brought to civilization.  I was fascinated when I read it as a child and I renewed my fascination many years later when I read it to my children.  Don't you OR your children miss out on this one!	2003-06-13

While stationed at Vicksburgh, he experiened the assault on and siege of the city.  He started a lengthy (78 page) letter to his wife.  He recounts in detail the events he observes from the front line defenses that repelled numerous Yankee assault to the many visits he made to the hospitals to the ultimate surrender of the city.  His attention to detail makes this first-person account an historically valuable document.  His empathy for his comrades and his style of writing makes it a literary asset as well.  The descriptions of the constant Yankee bombardment, the accounts of what he witnessed in the hospitals, the reports on the food shortages, as well as other items will captivate the reader.  This is a book that could well be read in a single sitting.  It has a helpful introduction with an overview of the conflict, a brief biographical sketch of the author, and footnotes.<br />Several years ago I was traveling in the Southeast and was looking forward to stopping at the Vicksburgh Battlefield.  I had hoped to get a good history of the conflict my Great Great Grandfather had participated in (on the Union side).  I was disappointed that the offices were closed and that I was unable to check out their bookstore.  I ended up picking up this book at the bookstore at the Shiloh Battlefield.  Now that I've read it, I think I have a better awareness of the Siege of Vicksburgh than any 400-page study could have given me.	2003-06-02

B. Singer that I thought was a waste of time.  This man is incredible with the stories he writes and the style he writes it in.  What is even more amazing is that Singer always maintained that his stories lost about 40% of their literary value in translation.  As great as I think he is, I apparently will never appreciate how great he really is because I can't read Yiddish.  That said, I don't recommend this book for an introduction to the author.  It is very good but it is not one of his better collections of short stories.  I'd actually rate it a 3.5 on this scale but, with Singer, you always round up.  For a good introduction to the author I would recomend &quot;Passions&quot;.<br />The stories I did enjoy the most were certainly worth the price of admission.  Those stories would include the title story.  The last line is terrific but not if you hadn't read the story first.  I enjoyed &quot;The Key&quot; in which a lonely widow discovers that she is surrounded by friends that she never before realized.  &quot;The Cafeteria&quot; is the type of love story that Singer writes when he is one of the lovers.  True romance seems to only happen to others in his stories.  &quot;The Chimney Sweep&quot; is a nice little story about what a knock on the head can do for a fellow.  &quot;Schlomele&quot; is a story about the sort of zany characters the author seemed to find so easily in this country.  &quot;The Colony&quot; is a sort of haunting story about a visit to Argentina.  It seems like all of his short story collections have a story about a visit to Argentina.  They seem to always be very good stories, too.  &quot;The Wager&quot; is the story of the tragic outcome of a practical joke gone bad.  &quot;The Son&quot; is a short but touching tale of a father and son reunion in a case where they were separated near birth and rejoined as grown and near-grown men.<br />There were many other stories but, as I looked back over them, they didn't seem as memorable as most of Singer's stories I've read in the past.  I started out by writing that you can't go wrong reading Isaac B. Singer.  I'll close by saying the same thing but I suggest you introduce yourself to him with a different book.

It sounded like a fascinating story so I made a mental note to keep an eye out for it at the book stores.  Time went on and I still hadn't come across it so I ordered it off Amazon.com.  When I got the book I was a little aprehensive at first.  The subtitle, \\"A True Story of Murder and Magic in Indian Country\\" made me wonder if I was going to get the facts or the myth.  When I started reading the first few pages, I was worried that I was going to get a skewered perspective of the events.  As it turned out, none of my concerns were realized and, instead, I got an excellent review of a sordid event in recent history.  <br />The main events of this story take place in the early 1970's.  Three Native Americans were brutally murdered by three White teenagers in Farmington, NM.  The author introduces us to the story through his own eyes as he discovers the tense aftermath of the murders and the reaction to the light sentencing that the youthful murderers received.  Although just passing through Farmington, Rodney Barker finds himself suddenly involved in the turmoil.  The events are etched in his mind and, when he dicovers more about it some years later, he decides to investigate the whole story.  <br />Mr. Barker does a very good job in telling the story and trying to do so from all available perspectives.  He is sensitive to the Navajo's point of view and goes to great lengths to bring that perspective to the reader.  Yet, despite his partisan introduction to the story, he seems to have done a pretty good job of getting the \\"Anglo\\" perspective as well.  There are times when there doesn't seem to be a reasonable response to some of what has happened.  Yet the author often brings us just such a response.  He follows the lives of the perpetrators and we find ourselves actually starting to care about them in their later lives.  He leaves not with answers but with an awareness instead.  <br />People not familiar with the tension of communities that border Native American reservations will find these events hard to believe.  For that matter, so will those who do live in such communities.  I read a Native American columnist once who said that the worst racism against Native Americans can be found in those communities that border reservations.  Mr. Barker's book is an example of that statement at its' worst.  Unfortuanately, while it makes us aware of this problem, it leaves an emptiness as we look for a solution to the problem.  Why was it that the teenage activity of \\"rolling\\" intoxicated Indians in Farmington was allowed to happen?  Was the author's explantion of the problem overstated or was the community's response to it understated?  I live near an Indian reservation and I can attest to stereo-typing and tension between the races.  However, it is nothing like the description of the situation in Farmington.  Thus I am wondering about many things as a result of reading this book.  The success of this book is that it has made me thing about things that need to be thought about.	2003-05-03
US	40051756	R20C1OST5L9Z7Q	0812930010	13294741	The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made	Books	5	51	55	N	N	The new Golden Age of Cinema	This book is an excellent resource for those who are looking for a good movie to watch.  Like any other &quot;list&quot; it has its' limits.  No two peoples likes and dislikes are exactly the same.  Thus there will be disagreements over what is included in the &quot;Best 1000 Movies&quot;.  Frankly though, the disagreements will probably be over what was included in this book rather than what was excluded; the top 1000 certainly covers a lot of ground.  As I came across a movie I thought was undeserving, I thought to myself, &quot;How could they include this movie and leave out...&quot;  Strangely enough, every movie I thought to finish the sentence with turned out to be in the book.  OK, so it IS short on some of the great comedy of the past; I believe &quot;Duck Soup&quot; is the only Marx Brothers entry.  But, then, I didn't need this book to tell me how good the Marx Brother movies are.  <br />What is has done for me, once I stopped gawking and started to put it to work, is introduce me to a lot of good movies that I would have missed otherwise.  I've been going to the video stores lately looking for the &quot;older&quot; movies of the 80's and 90's rather that the meager selections of new releases.  Agreed, most of the ones I've checked out have not been on anyone's top ten list.  However, they have been enjoyable and better than most of the movies I've seen on TV of late.<br />I do have a couple of mild criticisms of this book.  The first thing I would &quot;criticize&quot; is the format.  (It may also be its' strength so I proceed caustiously along this line).  The format is to list the movies with their original New York Times review.  That's very well except that the &quot;Times&quot; panned a number of these movies in their reviews.  &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; comes to mind as a movie that received a particularly bad review.  Now we all know that &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; is a deserving member of the Top 1000 because we've either seen it or know its'reputation.  But what about the lesser movies that we've neither seen nor heard much about.  How are we to be inspired to go out and watch based solely on a negative review.  Some historical perspective could have helped.  However, if that were the case, they'd probably still be writing the book.  Another &quot;criticism&quot; I have is how I was struck with the notion that most of the movies are of a more recent vintage.  I actually sat down and totalled the number of movies in the list by decade (yes, I DO have other things to do with my life).  I had always heard that the 1930's were the Golden Age of Cinema but the results suggest otherwise (at least in the eyes of these NY Times editors).  There were two movies in the 1920's (kudos to &quot;Disraeli&quot; and &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;), 92 in the 30's, 129 in the 40's, 146 in the 50's, 150 in the 60's, 156 in the 70's, 200 in the 80's and 128 in the 90's (the latest movies I noticed were in 1998).  Thus the new Golden Age would seem to be the 1980's.  Why doesn't seem that way in reality?  There was an art to movie-making in the pre-1970's that challenged the productions to use more symbolism.  Now that we have the technology and lack of inhibitions to show just about anything and everything on film, there seems to be little reason to be suggestive rather than blunt.  I suspect that the reason the number are so slanted towards recent vintage may be the failure of the editors to have seen more of the great movies of the past.  Having said that, I close with thanks for the effort that went into this book and the excellent resource it will serve for anyone who's looking for a good movie to watch.	2003-04-27
US	40051756	R3LF9T32URM68	0934977631	708710783	Reeds in the Wind	Books	3	8	12	N	Y	Not her best but still worth reading	This is the 5th book of Grazia Deladda that I have read and I don't believe that it lives up to her better works.  The best book of hers that I read is &quot;After the Divorce&quot;.  That book made me want to read more and it has been hard to track down other works by her.  Since discovering the wonders of modern technology, I have been able to order other of her works.  Some like &quot;The Mother and the Priest&quot; gave me a message to ponder while others gave me more of an appreciation of life in Sardinia 75 years ago (which is more like life 175 years ago in other European locales).  That flavor of life in her native island is always worth the price of admission to her books and &quot;Reeds in the Wind&quot; is no exception.  <br />In this novella (all of her books are short) we see the story of a family of aging sisters who are so down on their luck that their nobility is in name only.  We start the story by meeting the sister's servant, Efix.  As the tale unfolds we see that he is the person who runs the operation.  He does all the work, makes most of the arrangements, and smoothes many a feather.  Well, things happen, people come and go, and we end up with an ending that lets us appreciate how an poor, unpaid servant saves the day for his masters (mistresses?).  Along the way we again view a society and its' customs that would be otherwise unknown to us.  It is poignant at the end when the sisters take care of Efix after he is no longer able to care for himself.  The story of the servant managing the affairs of the sisters and the sisters caring for the servant gives a nice twist to a society that was obviously not used to such role reversals.  <br />If it were possible, I would rate this book 3 1/2 by the 5 star grading system.  That's not to say that this isn't a good book.  Rather it's to say that I know that the author has done better.	2003-04-14
US	40051756	R3G0AK1KVEYHA0	0685678822	366722023	Jean Barois (in French) (French Edition)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A Masterpiece for a Select Audience	This is the second book by Martin du Gard that I have read.  I enjoyed the first one, \\"The Thibaults\\", but I was uncertain of its' message.  I do not have such doubts about \\"Jean Barois\\".  There are actually two topics of note in this novel.  The primary one is the on-going debate between Christianity and what we have come to call \\"secular humanism\\".  The novel begins and ends with this theme.  In the middle half of the book, however, is another subject; The Dreyfus Affair.  <br />Persons interested in the debate between religion vs. atheism will find this a fascinating book.  The author really does justice to both sides of the issue and brings out the best artillery that each side had to offer.  The main character is a person who has gone out of his way to denounce all faith as meaningless.  He losses his wife and other loved ones in his adamant refusal to just show up for any Christian rites.  It's not enough to decline, he must also ridicule.  <br />The middle portion of the novel is a terrific insight to the affair of Captain Dreyfus.  In case you aren't aware of this notorious event in French History, it has to do with a French officer (Dreyfus) being found guilty of treason and exiled to Devil's Island.  It so happens that Captain Dreyfus is a Jew which many believe to be the reason that he was charged and convicted.  Some years after his conviction evidence came to light that exonerated the Captain and created a scandal for the whole French military.  (For some who have developed particular opinions of the French in the last 6 months, this might be reason enough to read the book).  The events unfold through the eyes of Jean Barois and his compatriots who publish a political magazine.  The heated discussions that these gentlemen have effectively draws out the various perspectives of the scandal and its' affect on France.  <br />The novel then finds it way back to the subject of religious faith vs. scientific fact.  This happens by the emergence of a new character and her affect on Monsiuer Barois.  Again the debate is heavily engaged and the reader will probably again be impressed by how the author is able to argue both positions so well.  Ultimately we see the author's preferred response to the issue but proponents of the oposite view will come away feeling that they had a fair hearing.  <br />For those interested in the two subjects I have cited, this book is a masterpiece of literature and should not be missed! For those not interested in the about subjects, this book should still be an enjoyable and enlightening experience.  I admit I was a bit confused by the dual subject matter and the almost abrupt change from one to the next.  However, I think the author did so to bring out the passion that was within Jean Barois and how it was, for a time at least, able to replace the passions of faith that exist in others.  This book was written 90 years ago but its' meaning and relevance is quite contemporary.  It may be hard to find but it'll be worth the effort.	2003-04-05

The categories of adventure that fit within these 607 pages are almost as numerous as the 43 different excerpts.  Mountain climbing seems to be the most prevelent form of exploring but there is also (Ant)Arctic treks, desert journeys, jungle adventures, white water canoeing, solo sea voyages, wilderness explorations, hunting, aviation, cave exploration, surviving a plain crash in the mountains, etc..   The editors confined their anthology to 20th Century accounts and quality of writing was an obvious consideration in their choices.  They also did a good job of excerpting some very exciting moments in the chronicles of man versus nature.  This is a good introduction of some great accounts of true adventure.  Many a reader will want to go out and read some of the books these excerpts come from.  <br />I felt this book was more a 4.5 than a 4 but I didn't want to give it too high of a rating.  I felt the shortcoming was that there was a fair amount of technical jargon to weed through(especially in the area of mountain-climbimg).  The editors did do a decent job of footnoting the more technical items but I would have preferred less mountain-climbing and more \\"in search of lost civilizations\\".  However, that is MY preference and I could easily be in the minority.  I was a little surprized at the quality of the hardbound edition.  The paper used was the same as that used in magazines which gave it a somewhat \\"cheap\\" appearance.  There is nothing \\"cheap\\", however, in its' content.  Whether you read it cover to cover or savor each adventure in its' own time, you will find a lot of excitement and enjoyment in this book.	2003-03-16

We are introduced to a young priest and his mother.  We discover from the beginning that the priest is having an affair with a young widow in town.  He is challenged by his mother whose faith impresses us with its strength.  The priest, in turn, seems weak in that area.  As other events take place, we see a transformation in the priest who struggles and falls but forces himself to do the right thing.  The mother, however, undergoes doubts and weakens in her resolve.  In the climatic ending we are reminded that faith is constantly challenged and thus is in need of regular maintenance.  <br />As in all of Grazia Deladda's novels, the reader gets a sense of life in the distant world of rural Sardinia and an appreciation for the story-telling abilities of this Nobel Prize-winning author.	2003-03-10
US	40051756	R2IZ2VDQ8BCWYA	0451522516	587225106	Elmer Gantry (Signet Classics)	Books	5	11	18	N	N	a brilliant, though one-sided, view	&quot;Elmer Gantry&quot; is certainly one of Sinclair Lewis's best works (although I found it a notch below &quot;Main Street&quot;).  In it he examines the rise of a young man in the world of religion.  We are introduced to him as an easy-going, not too deep, likeable (but not loveable) guy.  He has an incidental opportunity to give testimony at a classmate's street preaching.  He loves the thrill of speaking in front of an audience and his appetite is whet.  We follow the lives of two men actually, the other being another classmate named Frank Shallard.  Elmer Gantry is a man who uses religion to advance his career.  He focusses on sin because it is what he knows best.  Frank Shallard is a deeper thinker who struggles to reconcile his doubts with his faith.  The author uses the compaison of these two ministers to great effect. <br />We eaily come to view Elmer Gantry as a hypocrite because he practices what he preaches against.  Conversely, he preaches love but (except for a brief, real love affair) he seems only to love himself.  He is able to shed most of his sins but he still readily gives in to lust and avarice.  The reader sees all of his successes in his ministry as calculated moves designed to help his own self-promotion.  If, on the way up, it is necessary to knock others down, then so be it.<br />Frank Shallard rises to no great heights but he is fairly well situated with a well-to-do congregation and could easily coast on his moderate skills as a minister.  His search for the truth, however, leads him to reject most, if not all, of his faith.  As we are witnessing the escallation of Rev. Gantry's career, we catch, out of the corner of our eye, the decline of Rev. Shallard's career.  The author's implication seems to be that sincere soul-searching has no place in the world of big-time religion.  <br />Certainly there is ample opportunity for the reader to reflect on numerous similarities in today's society.  However, despite the author's repeated examination of the Christian faith, he misses many a point.  First of all, he, as do many people today, overlook the fact that Chritians acknowledge their sinfullness not as something that is discarded with a loud AMEN! but as something that is confronted on a daily basis.  When a Christian falls, he/she gets up and resumes the struggle.  Rev. Gantry is rather singular in his calculated and unreppentant sinful nature.  His only remorse is in getting caught.  Rev. Shallard seemed to miss this point as well.  Secondly, the parishioners of Rev. Gantry are portrayed either as self-centered businessmen or not portrayed at all.  They seem an amorphous mass blindly following while shouting &quot;Hallelujah!&quot;  While many people attend church for lesser reasons, presumeably many others are made better having heard the proper Christian message.  <br />Sinclair Lewis has written an excellent novel that rightfully examines how even the unsacred can succeed in the most sacred of professions.  Those who scoff at Chritianity will love this book.  However, the examination of these two men and the many theological discussions in the book will give everyone something to enjoy.	2003-03-01

Those who have studied the Spanish Civil War know that the level of hatred, distrust, brutality, and revenge was excessive in this conflict.  Indeed, they mirrored that of Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia which, not coincidently, exemplify the two main factions in this civil war.<br />Right from the beginning the author steps into the middle of this tension.  He is held in suspicion by the very side he has come to fight for.  The \\"in and out of favor\\" status that he holds gives this book an even greater flavor of the conflict he writes of.<br />The book is brief, in part because the authors's tenure in Spain was brief.  However, through his experiences and observations, we are able to understand much about this microcism of Twentieth Century European politics.  It is a memoir written with a poetic style which allows the author to say so much in so few pages.  As an account of the Spanish Civil War, it ranks up there with Orwell's \\"Homage to Catalonia\\".	2003-02-23

I have noted that none of the volumes seem to be any thicker than McMurtry's &quot;Crazy Horse&quot;.  I will assume that the purpose of this series is that the reader gets a brief overview of the highlights in the lives of an important historical person.  That sounds like a nice idea but the question I have regarding &quot;Crazy Horse&quot; is this; Does it half to be THIS brief?  <br />I was inclined to accept McMurtry's observation that little factual information exists on Crazy Horse.  In fact, I think he's soured me somewhat on reading Mari Sandoz's much lengthier biography.  However, this book goes in some strange directions dealing with this paucity of information.  For example, in trying to describe the great gathering of Indians at the Ft. Laramie Council of 1851, McMurtry inexplicably quotes Wilfred Thesiger's account of an Ethiopian gathering of African tribesmen.  Shortly thereafter, he describes the tribal warfare of the Sioux by quoting Peter Matthiessen's description of tribal warfare in New Guinea in the early 1960's.  Well, the primary resources on Native Americans may be limited but not so much that we must wander to other continents for our facts.  (On second thought, maybe I WILL read Sandoz's book).  McMurtry suggests at one point that it would be &quot;hubris&quot; to think that we can read Crazy Horse's mind.  He momentarily passes on speculation of Crazy Horse's thoughts and motives and then spends much of the remainder of the book doing just that.  So much of these 141 pages are devoted to events that happened during the time of Crazy Horse that little space is left to the man himself.  As a biography of facts this work seems more along the lines of Charlie Browns Christmas vacation book report.  <br />However, Larry McMurtry's talent is spinning a tale rather than reporting the facts.  This is the savinggrace of &quot;Crazy Horse&quot;.  It reads like a well-written short novel and will leave the reader exasperated but sensing nonetheless that he has just read a good story.	2003-02-13

In a sense, that's what we see in this compelling novel by Carson McCullers.  We see what one man means to others but he is never given his Clarence to find that out himself.  <br />It's hard to say just who is the main character in this book but I go with the idea that it is John Singer, a deaf mute who becomes the conscience of the community's troubled souls.  There are certainly other characters who take their repeated turns on the main stage.  There is an alcoholic labor agitator who can't seem to understand that complex new ideas are best delivered in simple, small doses.  There is a black doctor who has risen to to a height of respectability due his profession that is denied him due to his color.  There is the owner of a diner who is an observer of his community but apparently not a participant.  There is a young girl who becomes a woman way too soon.  All these people gravitate to Mr. Singer who can't speak but does a great job of listening (he is able to read lips).  While they unload their cares, they assume that their listener has no cares of his own.  The reader gradually realizes otherwise although Mr. Singer's solution to his own problems still comes as a shock.  In the end, the others move on and we are left with a glimpse of into life in a rural town in the Deep South circa 1939 (quite similar to \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\").<br />There are ample coices of themes in this book.  What I took away with me was the interdependence people have on each other.  Certainly there was plenty of discord shown on these pages.  However, each character needed to have someone to talk to in order to deal with their inner turmoils.  Mr. Singer was the ideal listener and people kept coming back to him because of this tonic that he offered.  In contrast, Singer had no one to talk to about his turmoils.  He did originally but that contact was withdrawn from him and ultimately lostto him altogether.  I'm sure others who read this book found other insights.  This is a very readable novel with something for everyone.  Read it and discover your own messages.	2003-02-12

I have had a number of disappointments (Claude Simon and Nadine Gordimer come quickly to mind).  I have also had a number of welcome surprizes (Isaac B. Singer, Franz Sillanpaa, and Grazia DeLadda are a few).  I checked out Irme Kertesz as soon as I heard of his award last October.  I understand that \\"Fateless\\" is his best work and it is indeed a good one.  It is a Holocaust tale as told through the eyes of a 14 year old boy.  Given the author's similar experiences at that age, this would seem to be an autobiographical novel.<br />This book works well because of the very detached way that all of this shocking story is presented.  We get a helpful preview of this detachment as the story teller relates about events and conversations involving his mother and father (who are divorced).  His father is going to be \\"sent away\\" by the authorities and there is what the boy perceives to be a going away party.  His total lack of concern regarding the possible fate awaiting his father and his apparent indifference to whether he is to live with mother or step-mother sets that tone for his discriptions of increasingly macabre scenes.  His focus tends to avoid the brutal and center on the entertaining.  We, of course, see what he seems to miss but he presents things we would never conceive of.  His non-judgemental approach contrasts with our very judgemental perspective challenging us to try and understand his point of view.  The author is not attempting to be funny but some may read this book with a sense that it is all in very bad taste.  This would be a mistake.  This is a story of survival by adaptation.  We know the scope of the tragedy but have not lived it.  The narrator knows how to live it without understanding the scope of the tragedy.  When it is all over, he knows something bad has happened but he prefers to go on surviving.<br />I have found that the best Holocaust literature is thatwhich leaves us confused; there are no simple explanations to what has happened.  This book is a unique approach that leaves us wondering what has happened.	2003-01-23

I noticed that the book's format was that Jim Klobuchar would write a chapter followed by a chapter written by Fran Tarkenton himself.  You all know the format for sport's autobiographies; well-known sport's star pens his story with the assistance of a literate sports writer.  It seems like you can't find a sport's autobiography over the last 40 years that didn't fit this format.  And it seems to be unique to sports stars because political and historical figures seem to have &quot;editors&quot; for their autobiographies.  The sports books are always &quot;co-written&quot; with the adverb &quot;and&quot; or &quot;with&quot; separating the two names.  Why all of this focus about format?  Well, &quot;Tarkenton&quot; is amazing because the chapters written by Fran Tarkenton are noticeably better than the ones written by Jim Klobuchar.  I was astounded as I read the book but chapter after chapter reinforced this incredible fact.  Mr. Tarkenton speaks with seriousness about his life and experiences while Klobuchar rants and raves throwing sports cliches around like confetti on New Year's Eve.  Thus my suggestion is that you get the book and read only the chapters written by Fran Tarkenton.  Believe me, you won't be missing a thing.	2003-01-13

It contains elements of suspense, mystery, intrigue, and romance.  It is one of the best novels I've read about the plight of regugees at the outbreak of WWII (with similarities with the first part of Traven's \\"The Death Ship\\").  It is the tale told by one refugee to another over the course of a night in Lisbon (hence the title).  The narrator is the listener and the story he is told builds into a very good romance that reminded me a lot of the movie \\"Casablanca\\".  While an endless and exciting series of arrests, escapes and near-misses is going on, we discover a special kind of love between a man who returns to his wife after a number of years of exile.  In the topsy-turvy world of Europe at the outbreak of WWII, the standards for conventional romance and fidelity are lost in the need for something more flexible.  The reader may question many aspects of the love that is expressed in these pages but not the love itself.  I was impressed as I have been with other books by this author.  Remarque portrays the chaos of life during WWI as well as Heinrich Boll portrays it in post-war Germany.  This is a novel with terrific insight to the times in which it takes place and the capacity for love to prevail against overwelming odds.  I'd rate it a 4.5.	2003-01-09

I can say with such authority that this one may be his best.  George Orwell was, first and foremost, a Socialist and this book is his examination of being a Socialist in a Capitalist world.  His hero, Gordon Comstock, is mired in a dead-end job that is just middle-class enough to require proper dress and behavior but not enough to enable him to afford any but the most essential living expenses.  We sympathize with him.  Or at least we do until we realize that his disdain for the pursuit of money has pointed him in the opposite direction.  He is so anti-capitalist that he purposely keeps himself in his lower state.  He quit a previous job because it paid too much.  He won't strive beyond his current status because then he would enter a higher social status.  He is convinced of the righteousness of his beliefs even though he has bled his sister dry \\"borrowing\\" money from her over the years.  She \\"lends\\" him the money because the family always had such high hopes for this erudite young man.  Gordon complains, to those that listen, that money is the root of all evil yet he is so ready to be victimized by it.  He complains to his girl-friend that she measures him by his net-worth.  This isn't true but he can't see that the problem is that HE is measuring himself by his own net-worth.  He talks the talk but can't walk the walk.  Well, money leads to one disaster of his own making and ends up as the solution to another \\"disaster\\" of his own making.  I'm sure the prospective reader would prefer to read the book to see how his story ends so I won't go into any more details here.<br />This novel is enjoyable on many levels.  I found myself, like most, getting upset with Gordon Comstock for his self-destructive \\"nobility\\".  I was ready to rant and rave about it until I remembered my post-college Bohemian days and realized that I went through such a stage myself.  I'm sure many of us have and so I think there is a personal connection that will appeal to a lot of readers.  For pure literary merit, this is a hard 20th Century satire to top.  Orwell scared a lot of people with his futuristic novels \\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"1984\\".  He tried to indoctrinate many a reader with his Socialistic essays including his half-novel/half-essay; \\"The Road to Wigan Pier\\".  I have a feeling that he was poking fun at himself in \\"Keep the Aspidistras Flying\\".  Maybe that's why it works so well.	2003-01-06

My 5th grade class had studied Tibet and I always meant to read it.  Well, many years later, I finally got around to it and it turned out to be a rather interesting book.  What makes it interesting is this glimpse at the many different people who make up the vast area of Tibet.<br />The author, Leonard Clark, is a rather archaic type of fellow to read in the 21st century.  It's somewhat akin to reading about a 19th Century explorer 50 years ago.  The man, fresh out of World War II intrigue in this general area of China, decides that he wants to explore the area of a sacred mountain.  The name of the mountain is Amne Machin and it is located deep in the thinly explored areas of Tibet.  Mr. Clark briefly explains the background to his quest and, before we know it, he is on his way to Tibet with a mere $1200 to finance his travels.  He is an odd sort of fellow who reminds you of a middle-aged bachelor British nobleman who explores for a living.  His rare reflections on life indicate a rather detached point of view.<br />We sense his quest to find and measure the height of Amne Machin although I didn't feel particularly excited about this aspect of his travels.  I was most interested in the many different tribes of peoples and their remoteness from the rest of the world.  Many of these different tribesmen are Mongols who date back to the original Horde.  Mr. Clark has convinced the local military leader of the need to find an escape route from the unstoppable advance of the Red Chinese.  Thus he is able to explore this lawless area accompanied by a small army.  Mr. Clark is an astute observer of the many different tribes, flora, fauna, customs, topography and travails of the area.  I found myself shivering with him in the many blizzards he seemed to encounter.  I also found myself wondering if I, too, could survive on the various forms of food and drink that he subsisted on.  <br />This book didn't exactly grab me once I started reading it.  In fact I kept it at the office and would read a bit of it several times a week during my lunch break.  It left me wondering about whatever happened to these many tribes of people rather than wondering whatever happened to the author.	2003-01-01

One of the entities is the director of a provencial Japanese weather station who is the local expert on a dormant volcano.  Another is an apostate Catholic Priest who senses that his life ceased its' meaning when he ceased his calling.  The last entity is the volcano itself.  Although we don't sense a personality to the volcano, it is a metaphor to the other two;  is there life left in it or has it spent all it had already.  <br />There is a good deal of reflection by the two human characters about their lives.  The director discovers that his obsession with the volcano cost him the love of his family.  The apostate priest is \\"tolerated\\" in his declining years.  He is obsessed with proving his theory that Japanese culture is incompatable with Christianity.  He bases this on his theory that Japanese do not sense guilt as Western cultures do.  Thus Christ's death on the cross loses its' meaning.  <br />We read on in hopes for an epiphany of sorts that would allow the two men to resurrect their lives.  In the end we are left only wondering about the future of one of the entities.	2003-01-01

This set of stories are very autobiographical; especially in the first part.  The title story is a tale of young love.  The message that came through to me was the innocence of the attraction of the two main characters.  After that came a touching diary that told of the relationship of a teenage boy and the elderly, invalid grandfather who raised him.  It reminded me of my relationship with my own grandfather.  The other sketches were worth reading as well and most were only two or three short pages in length.  There is certainly a poetic style in Kawabata's works.  This particular collection is a good introduction to the writer.	2002-12-21

My main confusion with \\"And Never Said a Word\\" was that I found myself looking past the story to a symbolism that may or may not have been there.  I almost missed a reasonably good sketch in the process.  <br />The story starts out giving us some clear signs of a marriage in trouble; a husband sends just about all of his paycheck to his wife and then drinks up the remainder.  We discover more and more problems as the novel unfolds.  This is helped by the author's effective use of the narration which alternates each chapter between husband and wife.  As I was going along, I sensed a metaphor between the collapse of a marriage and the collapse of Nazi Germany, the soldier returning home to a marriage destroyed as a metaphor to returning to a society destroyed.  Oops, that didn't seem to pan out.  The husband's military service was \\"boring\\" duty as a telephone operator.  His personal struggle seems to be with poverty in the present tense rather than post traumatic stress disorder.  Then I looked to the marital seperation as a metaphor for the division of Germany into East and West.  This, too, seemed to be a stretch.  This is the story of a marriage that is failing and of the efforts of the spouse's to deal with the situation.  I guess it's the scarcity of hope and the disfunctional nature of the husband that sends one looking for meaning on a larger scale.  Yet the title causes one to reflect one last time on the novel's message.  We find out that the title comes from the American Negro Spiritual \\"And He Never Said a Mumblin' Word\\".  I only heard that spiritual once and my recollection of the message was that of Christ taking his pain and suffereing in quiet submission.  It is with quiet submission that Fred and Kate Bogner take their pain and suffering.  We know that within Christ's pain and suffering is a powerful love.  On an admittedly lesser scale we see the same thing in \\"And Never Said a Word\\".	2002-12-01

Books	4	0	0	N	N	55 days in peking	This is a good book that I probably would have rated 4.5 if it were possible.  The author has an excellent introduction that essentially is a synopsis of the whole event.  She mentions that there were a number of personal histories and recollections written by the European and American participants.  We see the events as recorded by these numerous witnesses and this is effective.  I have read many a work of non-fiction that has been dragged down by a ponderous morass of first person accounts.  Ms. Preston knows how to &quot;cut and paste&quot; so that we get the flavor but not the indigestion.  The story moves and our attention is maintained throughout.  This is good because the story is a suspenseful one that takes places simultaneously at several locales.  Ms. Preston handles this well by focussing on the main events and filling us in later on the peripheral ones.  The conclusion was well done.  We get a &quot;whatever happened to&quot; recap of the main characters.  This is interesting although I felt short-changed on the recap of the Rev. Roland Allen who became an unmentioned authority on the development of local ministry.  The apparent lack of Chinese (and Japanese) sources gives this a rather one-sided perspective.  The reader is curious, for example, as to why such small forces could defeat such overwhelming numbers.  The author gives some reasons but we lack that personal perspective from the other side.  The author's epilogue probably should have been included in her &quot;Notes and Sources&quot; because it seemed a poor way to finish an otherwise engrossing account of a footnote in History.	2002-11-24

Everyone knows who Geishas are but it has been my experience that no one ever spells it out.  You get a fair idea from this book.  There's not a lot of time for background in the 119 pages of this novella but we do get a good look at a woman who seems to lack any control over herself or her destiny.  She has lost her past, can't figure out her present, and avoids any effort to create a future.  There are developments in her life that seem encouraging but the self-destructiveness of the main character makes this work a tragedy.  It is a tragedy worth reading as well as a brief look beyond the imagery of a Geisha.	2002-11-10

Ms. Atwood is a brilliant author and conveyor of the feminine mind and perspective.  Some of her novels are outstanding while most are at least very good.  &quot;The Edible Woman&quot; is an excellent beginning for the author but it has its' flaws.  The main flaw is the symbolism.  The symbolism is too forced and it doesn't work well.  I found myself wondering if I wanted to spend the time trying to figure out the symbolism.  I decided that I didn't.  The symbolism centers around the inability of the main character to eat a growing number of foods.  I guess this was to coincide with the events in her life in which she was being &quot;consumed&quot; by those around her.  The author's talent gave us a good enough story without the food distractions.  It is a story of a young professional woman who seems to know what she wants but lets others call the shots.  She enters into relationships with two different men neither of whom is in anyway suited for her.  We are glad that the relationship with her fiance fizzles but we are left wondering why she ever got involved with the graduate student.  We rejoice at her ultimate independence but are made to  sift through the final installment of symbolism in order to do so.  <br />Ms. Atwood has used symbolism since her opening act as a novelist.  However, to her credit, she learned to be more subtle about it.  This was a good beginning and it only gets better from here on.	2002-11-03

If you have considered reading this book then you are already familiar with the host of FOX News's &quot;O'Reilly Factor&quot;.  I doubt there is anyone who agrees exactly with everything that Bill O'Reilly has to say on his show.  Likewise, I doubt that there is anyone who has read this book that agrees with everything that he has written.  O'Reilly's eclectic assortment of personal beliefs challenges stereo-typing his placement in the political spectrum.  The result is you find yourself alternately spewing praise and venom at his opinions.  Actually, I didn't spew forth too much venom but I did have to disagree a number of times with the author.  What I had the hardest time with were not his views on politics but on marriage and friendship.  I had to double check the biographical data because I wasn't sure Mr. O'Reilly was married (he is-or was, at least at the time he wrote this book).  His strong advocacy of regular nights out with the boys caught me a bit off guard.  <br />Having read through all of his ideas, the reader concludes with the sections on the ridiculous, the bad, and the good in America. These observations are pretty entertaining as well.  O'Reilly detests the Clintons which will be hard to swallow if you're on the opposite side of the fence.  However, if you don't agree with him on anything else in the book, his observations on the Impeached One are worth the whole book.  I enjoyed it.  My guess is you will too.	2002-10-28
US	40051756	R26K0XOJYQMLON	0679761594	989682793	Stories of Scottsboro	Books	5	19	20	N	N	A forgotten embarassment	One of the more controversial events of the 1930's took place near Paint Rock, Alabama when nine Negro youths were arrested for the rape of two white women on a freight train.  The nine were quickly tried and found guilty.  Before the death penalty could be administered, appeals were filed with the aid of the US Communist Party.  Thence ensued a lengthy series of trials and appeals that lasted from 1931 until well into the forties.  It was a legal battle between White and Black as well as North and South with the battlefield always under the control of the White Southerners.  Today it is an incident lergely forgotten by succeeding generations.  Yet it is an excellent example of the the state of race relations in the South (not that there are too many surprises there), the role of moderate judges in reconciling racial injustice, the influence of the Communist/Socialist Parties in the 1930's as well as a number of other splinter stories.  Therein lies the excellence of this book.  <br />The author attempts to relate the story of the \\"Scottsboro Boys\\" through various perspectives without really indicating a particular bias.  As the story goes on these perspectives seem to roll into one but even that one perspective takes a middle road approach to the story.  For example, we are told of all the difficulties that the main characters suffer while imprisoned.  Simultaneously we are made to understand that these same characters have serious flaws of their own.  <br />The book follows the story of all the principals from their entry into the story until their death.  There were few successes to come out of this event and the author lets us see the failures of the \\"Scottsboro Boys\\" as they each eventually realized their freedom.  <br />This is an extremely readable work of non-fiction.  It may seem occasionally that the story is stuck at one particular point but it generally moves along, giving the reader a rare insight into a very American event in history.	2002-10-27

When I read the descriptions of Fo's avant garde works, I thought it looked too strange for my taste.  However, I came across this book on sale so I thought I'd take a look.  I was very pleasantly surprised and actually had a hard time putting the book down. <br />This is a collection of four plays.  The first one is rather political in nature and might seem more enjoyable with a better knowledge of contemporary Italian economics.  However, the absurdity comes through very clearly.  The comedy comes through as well.  I came away with a pretty good grasp of the author's view of the Italian economic problems (as well as that of the European Economic Community).  However, this leftist view point left me feeling that there is another side to the story.  That, of course, is my problem and not the author's shortcoming.  <br />The second play is an interesting and enjoyable look at Queen Elizabeth I done in great comedy and absurdity.  There is a main character named Grosslady who steals the show.  She speaks a sort of Esperanto slang that is absolutely hilarious.  There is an accompanying translation in the back of the play to help the reader understand her \\"language\\".  I normally dislike anything that detracts from the flow of the book.  However, I enjoyed the availability of the translation to help me follow the flow of the book.  At the same time, I made sure I read the actual lines that Grosslady has in the play because it is such a brilliant comedic concoction.  For example, her word for England is \\"Angleterror\\".  This was all brilliantly translated by Gillian Hanna.  <br />The last two plays are interesting examinations of human relationships and interdependence.  They continue in the comedy of the absurd.  <br />Perhaps the best recommendation I can give this collection is that I am now looking to read more of Dario Fo's works.Give this one a try!	2002-10-21

This is a compilation of the author's articles on Baseball that have appeared primarily in his newspaper columns over the years.  Mr. Will, a spokesman for the political right, discards his politics for these excursions into his passion.  Indeed, one is surprized by how often Mr. Will sides with the players in the labor/management diputes that litter modern Baseball.  The author shares his nostalgia for the past and his appreciation of the heros of the present.  If he seems a bit caught up in his Cubs and Orioles, he can be forgiven because the reader has his/her own favorites.  We know the frustration and joy of the same loyalties he shares with us.<br />I read the first two thirds of the book one &quot;column&quot; at a time between other books.  I did so because I had read &quot;The Best of Jim Murray&quot; some years ago and did so over the course of several days.  By the mid-point of that book, I came to the realization that Mr. Murray had written the same column for decades.  It was just a matter of changing the name of the subject.  You don't catch on to that reading two or three columns a week.  Well, I read the last third of the book in the course of several hours.  I did not get the same reaction that I got to Murray's book.  However, I lost track of the number of times the total season attendance of the 1935 St. Louis Browns (80,922) was compared to the Opening Day attendance of the 1993 Colorado Rockies (80,227).  There were other such repetitions of facts and figures that were noticeable when the book is read cover to cover.  I suggest you savor the articles and let the book entertain you throughout the course of a summer or a year.  However you choose to read it, don't miss this intellectual appreciation of what was once known as &quot;America's Pasttime&quot;.	2002-09-23
US	40051756	R24NOCROHG9HQN	0679745580	990777880	In Cold Blood	Books	5	4	8	N	N	disturbing panorama of a multiple murder	After years of hearing about the book, seeing the movie twice and  seeing the fairly decent made-for-TV movie, I finally got around to reading the book this summer.  This is an excellent book and it gives the reader a sense of intimacy with all of the main characters and a fairly good relationship with many of the minor characters.  That, for many of us, is a strange feeling.  It is strange because we are at least given the opportunity to get to know two men responsible for a brutal, unnecessary quadruple murder.  I cannot give the correct literary history of this book.  However, I believe it may have broken new ground with this intimate portrayal of the two men.  I am sure many a reader has found themselves sympathizing with Richard Hickok and Perry Smith-especially Perry Smith.  There is plenty of background on each and, in the case of Smith, lots that could lead a liberal-minded person to see him as a victim.  Many, I'm sure, have applauded this sympathetic insight.  Many others, I'm equally sure, have condemned the equal billing of guilty murders and innocent victim.  Either way the author derserves credit for having taken this approach.  It rests ultimately with the reader to sort out where his or her emotions should properly settle.  <br />The structure of the book is generally helpful to the author's purpose.  We meet and get to know the victims, we get a brief introduction to the murderers,  the murderers enter the household, the murderers leave the household, the murderers get away.  We are in the dark about what actually happened.  We spend a lot of time following the murderers and reading about their youth and early adulthood.  Eventually a major break in the case occurs and the murderers are caught.  Only after they are interogated does the missing piece of the story get revealed.  This is a good literary move because it brings us back to the brutality of the murders and reminds us of the dark side of Smith and Hickok.  From there we go through the trial, conviction and death sentence.  It is at this point that the reader is reminded that this book was originally a series of magazine articles for, I believe, The New Yorker.  The remainder seems to have been added on because it doesn't quite fit the flow of the book up to that point.  We are briefed on the endless delays, appeals, a retrial, further delays, etc.  During this time we actually have a couple of new characters introduced into the story.  They are the co-inhabitants of the Kansas State Prison death row.  I was never sure if these additional characters added to or detracted from the storyline.  <br />This book with make you examine your own feeling about good and evil, the death penalty, and society in general.  It did not change my points of view but it gave me cause to reaffirm them.	2002-08-30

However, this is a collection of his early stories with most dating back to the late 1940's and early 1950's.  It is interesting to see the early focus on the out-of-body, after-life and other-worldly experiences that lead the author toward the eventual &quot;magic realism&quot;.  That doesn't mean that they're good stories to read.  In fact, I found most stories (other than the title story) to be rather tedious reading even as short as most of them were.  &quot;Innocent Erendira&quot; is a good example of the author's polished style and stands as a contrast to the other works.  Some sort of editing mishap has the book lead with &quot;Innocent Erendira&quot; rather than closing with it.  Thus we see the best in the beginning and watch the rest go down hill rather than build up to the climax (as should have been done).  I have often made it a point to read all of a favorite author's works and Garcia Marquez is certainly a favorite of mine.  However, I have learned that even greatness has its' measure of mediocrity.  This book is a reminder of that.	2002-08-27

The action starts seemingly with the opening paragraph and it continues throughout the book.  It is the story of a battle seen through the eyes of the troops on the ground (with an occassional look from the helicopters).  My initial reaction was to appreciate not having to go through a number of chapters methodically setting the stage for the action.  Later I found I would have liked a bit more background to better understand how we got to this stage in our Somalian misadventure.  I'm one of the many who thought we were still feeding the hungry when I heard about this engagement.  The author's brief summation left me wanting a bit more.  However, his moment by moment recount of the battle kept me gripping the edge of my seat (and I  had seen the movie first).  In many combat histories we can tell who isn't going to make it because they're the ones we get little background information on.  In this book we get to know all of the soldiers and are emotionally involved with the losses in their ranks.  Yet their losses are surprizingly minimal given the overwhelming odds they faced.  This is an interesting view of the abilities of well-trained, well-armed brave men facing large numbers of poorly-trained, disorganized enemies.  It is a view that Americans will gain reassurance from as our troops may find themselves engaged in battle in the months to come.  Hopefully, though, they won't find themselves caught surrounded like they were in Mogadishu.  This is a timely book and should be read by all who have even a passing interest in the immediate future activities of our military.  It should also be read by those who would like to appreciate the quality of men in our armed services and the sacrifices they recently made.  They're ready to make them again.	2002-08-24

Indianapolis and the Extraordinary Story of Its Survivors	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Truth is more suspenseful than fiction	Last year I read &quot;Abandon Ship&quot; by Richard Newcomb after which I was engrossed in the story of the USS Indianapolis.  I noticed that &quot;In Harm's Way&quot; was out and thought I would read that as well.  Both books are very good and I would rate them both a 4.5 on a scale of 1-5.  Both give the background of the ship, the mission and the circumstances that led to the largest naval disaster in US history.  Both books give a point of view through the eyes of a number of survivors although there are different accounts in each book.  While I rate the books equally, I give a slight nod to &quot;In Harm's Way&quot; as the better of the two.  It gave me a greater sense of the personal suffering that was involved and a greater sense of the gradual deterioration of the survivors as they awaited rescue with dwindling hope.  Like most people, I became acqainted with the Indianapolis through the movie &quot;Jaws&quot;.  While sharks were definitely the cause of many deaths, there were other causes as well that led to the loss of hundreds of lives in the ocean.  It is truly difficult to comprehend one's own chances of survival in such a hell.  The background of the story of the Indianapolis is crucial to the appreciation of the fate of these men and both books lay out the story well.  Once the ship is torpedoed, the story becomes quite compelling.  I found it very difficult to put down.  In fact, I was confronyed with a choice while reading this book.  I had gotten up one morning and immediately began reading from where I had left off the night before.  I was at the point in the story where the survivors had been discovered and the rescue operation was underway.  My daughter turned on the TV and there was a breaking news story about the rescue of nine minors who were trapped for several days in a mine in Pennsylvania.  Water from an old mine had poured into their mineshaft when the wall between the two was broken.  I had been aware of this disaster and, like many, had thought that the minors might be beyond rescue after so much time in a water-logged mineshaft.  Indeed, there were some amazing similarities between the two disasters; failure to execute proper safty precautions, submersion in water, endless delays on eventual rescue, real danger of hypothermia, etc..  As I was reading the books and looking at the breaking news story, I had to make a choice of which to focus on.  Even though I had read of the Indianapolis disaster  before, I opted to stay with the book and catch up on the minor's rescue later on.  I mention this as an example to how compelling this story is and how well the author is able to bring it to life.  Read this book.

US	40051756	R2GM6H09ZG2ALJ	1401300057	930186214	Firehouse	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Perfect Heroes	This in a very good book about a group of men at a Manhatten firehouse who were called to duty on September 11, 2001.  I got the feeling that they weren't called to duty so much as they heard duty calling them.  In this brief book we are given a glimpse of each of the men who responded to the call.  We are also given a briefer glimpse at those who were not on duty that day and how they dealt with their emotions.  To most of us, the men who risked their lives were certainly heroes but they remained names without a story.  Mr. Halberstam has given this group a personality that enables the reader to more greatly appreciate their sacrifice.  For this reason alone, the book's mere 200 pages are well worth the short time it takes to read.  However, this is a story about all firemen because of how the author gives us a vivid insight to life in the firehouse.  We see the cameraderie and the fraternal nature of firefighters.  The pay is poor and the risk is great but good men continue to respond to the call.  In this book we get a sense as to why that is.  <br />If this book has a fault it is that its' subjects are too perfect.  These men have no faults; if they are grumpy, they are loveably grumpy, if they are divorced, the divorce was amicable and they remain on good terms with their ex.  Should we be told of personal shortcomings for these fallen heroes?  Many would say no.  However, I believe that the author meant for us to see these men as people like ourselves; men who were doing the hourly-pay job that they were trained to do.  In their case they made a difference by perservering in their jobs in the face of imminent peril.  In our case we may never have to face such a challenge but these men have shown us that ordinary men doing extra-ordinary things DO make a difference. By portraying these men as a cut above ordinary, the point is lost.  Still, there is much greatness in this book and I am content to accept the men as the author has chosen to portray them.	2002-08-18

It is written in a style and format that that is compelling and informative.  The typical sports biographies tell a series of funny and dramatic inside stories around memorable moments in sports history that the subject participated in.  When well done, the reader gets what he or she is looking for and then some.  When poorly done we get some stale jokes, old stories and an inept attempt at describing the true meaning of courage.  In &quot;I Had a Hammer&quot; Henry Aaron and  Lonnie Wheeler have given us a glimpse at a young black man growing up in the Deep South to become the greatest home run hitter of all time.  In the odyssey we see the elements of society alternately denigrate and celebrate this gifted athlete.  We are given these insights through the co-writer's preambe to each chapter and the personal recollections of key players in the  life and career of Hank Aaron.  This array of perspectives is excellently done and gives the book a good flow.  What gives it the greatest impact is the candid personal recollections of Mr. Aaron.  He is outspoken in his contempt for the elements of racism that followed (or is it lead) him every step of the way to the top.  Yet he is forgiving of many who may have slurred his race in the past and then later learned to overcome their biased opinions.  Much of that transition came through their experiences with him and other early black major league ball players.  This is a book about our nation's racial attitudes as seen through the experiences of the author.  <br />Don't be mistaken, this is still an excellent book for the sports fan.  The casual fan will come away with a greater sense of sports history.  The Braves fan will really enjoy some of the historic events recreated in the middle chapters.  The Milwaukee fan need only read the last paragraph of chapter 7 and a tear or two will likely fall.  The Atlanta fan will come away with a challenge to accept the validity of Aaron's view of his experiences in that city.  Some will and some won't.  However, all sports fans will come away with an excellent education on race relations in America from the 1930' to very recent years.  They will gain this insight not through a lecture by the authors but by the very human expressions of a man telling his own compelling story.	2002-07-20

This collection is an excellent example of the quality and diversity of Singer's talent.  There are stories from the present and from the past all containing marvelous characters that amuze, intrigue, and/or mystify the reader.  Among the best are \\"The Admirer\\", \\"Sabbath in Portugal\\", \\"Three Encounters\\", \\"The Adventure\\", and \\"Passios\\".  \\"The Admirer\\" is a tale about a meeting with a fan of his that turns into a comical nightmare.  \\"Sabbath in Portugal\\" is a tale of a lonely visit to an alien country where the author encounters a faith that survived the inquisition and an encounter with someone he thought was lost forever.  \\"Three Encounters\\" is the tale of a young man's innocent suggestion to a young bride and the sucessive corruption that results.  \\"The Adventure\\" tells of an unusual request and the challenge of if and how to respond.  Finally, \\"Passions\\" tells of the ability of a simple man to overcome the impossible with the proper amount of focussed passion.  All the stories are worth reading.  The world's greatest short story writer has produced another example of why he is so revered.	2002-07-03

I think the reason is that this book is essentially a biography and, thus, it gives the author a more limited scope.  If your wish is to read a biography of David Cone, you could not pick a better author to do the job.  If you want to enjoy the writing of Roger Angell, you may, at times, feel like David Cone gets in the way.  <br />What an interesting turn of events; a world class baseball essayist picks an all-star caliber NY Yankee pitcher to follow through a season.  They both agreed that this would turn into a book after the season.  The problem is that this turns out to be the worst season of Cone's career.  Lesser participants would have probably dropped the idea in mid-season.  However, this book turns out to be more than the recap of a swan song.  Angell gives us the beginning and the middle of Cone's career to go along with the end.  We see the highlights and not just the low lights.  David Cone makes for an interesting subject but the reader often enjoys the sidebar stories more than the Cone stories.  The beauty of Angell's writing is how he takes us on journeys through Baseball and the reader is able to see through the author's panoramic view.  We may start with the Red Sox and end up with the Padres.  In this book we keep coming back to the ups and downs of David Cone.  There are times we would have preferred to linger at other places and with other personalities that Angell introduced us to.  Still there is plenty here to keep the reader's interest.  <br />One last comment is on the publisher which is Warner Books.  I am confused how it came to be that a lesser publisher would handle this project.  The book may be well-written but it is of poor quality.  My hardbound copy may not withstand another reading as it is already showing signs of coming apart.  I recommend getting the paperback version (assuming there is one).  I suspect the paperback will last longer than the cloth-bound edition.	2002-06-16
US	40051756	R279WIMLCP8KWD	0688039014	101552875	The Glory of Their Times: The Story of the Early Days of Baseball Told by the Men Who Played It	Books	5	99	100	N	N	"All these were honored in their generation"	This is one of the greatest books I've ever read and may well be the best non-fiction book I ever read.  The book is actually a collection of reminiscences of old-time baseball players compiled by their interviewer, Lawrence Ritter.  The original book was written in 1966 with additional chapters added for the revised 1984 version that I read.  What comes across first and foremost in all the recollections is the joy and dedication of the long-retired players.  At a time when labor strikes, hold-outs and escalating salaries are standard sports stories, this book takes Baseball nostalgia to a new level.  It isn't just about the joy of the game, however.  This book brings to light a lot of forgotten Baseball history.  I fancied myself a bit of a Baseball historian but there were a number of major events in Baseball's early history that I had never heard of before.  I think the most memorable was Fred Merkle's \\"bonehead\\" play that cost the Giants the pennant in 1907.  That was a situation where he forgot to touch second base and thereby cost the Giants the winning run.  It is told (and referred to often) with better embelishment than I just gave it but, then, that's the point of my praise; the whole book is a poetic look backwards at the game we sometimes take for granted these days.  It's no accident that the best parts of the book are the earliest recollections.  You can almost see the corrupting effects of popularity creep up on the game in the 1920's.  The stories that these veterans tell and the details that they give make you feel like you've been there yourself.  If you're a Baseball fan, you'll love this book.  If you're not a Baseball fan, reading this book might just make you one.	2002-06-06

It was the summation of what my youthful mind had been trying to figure out.  Let me preface my further comments by saying that I am a devoted (I hope) Christian and have been for over 15 years.  However, there was a long stretch when I was a confirmed atheist and, if I was to point to a Bible for that point of view, for me it was this book.  In this short novel, Twain tells his story through the experiences of some young boys who encounter a \\"mysterious stranger'.  The stranger points out many of the inconsistencies of Christianity and the world around us.  Essentially the issue is the question many people have asked over the years; Why do bad things happen to good people?  Twain delves deeply into this issue and the numerous examples lead the young narrator to conclude that the rantings of the stranger are, indeed, the truth.  I am comfortable today re-reading this fascinating story because it is such an excellently crafted expalantion of Twain's theology in his later years.  As a student of Twain, I became exasperated by the many scholars who tended to dismiss his later writings as the ramblings of a grieving man.  It is true that Twain suffered many personal losses and I am sure that it influenced his perspective.  However, much of his later work was brilliant.  The reviewers I read often dismissed these later body of writing.  It seemed to me that most of them had the opinion that, if it didn't make you laugh or give you insight to life on the Mississippi, then it wasn't important.  I heartily disagree and \\"The Mysterious Stranger\\" is an excellent example of the brilliance of his later works.<br />I looked over the table of contents of this collection and I noticed a lot of other good stories among them.  Two that came to mind were \\"Captain Stormfield\\" and \\"The Man who Corrupted Hadleyburg\\".  This strikes me as a great introduction to the Mark Twain beyond \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Huckleberry Finn\\".	2002-06-04

The book has a plot and the reader gets drawn into it but the story seems to end ahead of the anticipated conclusion.  The reader is left wanting answers and may go away disappointed.  However, I believe Garcia Marquez only meant to give us a snapshot in the life of a community in turmoil.  I believe he meant for us to be left in the dark.  Perhaps he wanted to give an impression of a world where there is always conflict without resolution.  <br />This is a well-written book with an interesting cast of characters.  It is, nonetheless, a snapshot; not the whole roll of film.	2002-05-17

I WAS, however, very impressed with the author's fiction in those days.  In my humble opinion, McMurtry has written three or four excellent novels with a number of other very enjoyable ones as well.  In my book the top three would be, in no particular order, &quot;Leaving Cheyenne&quot;, &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; and &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; (I'm considering throwing in &quot;Horseman Pass By&quot;).  I was always buying the latest McMurtry book to come out but, in his later years, I was frequently disappointed.  I was finding plots and characters increasingly more and more bizarre.  Knowing the man's potential, I kept trying.  I am glad I did because I enjoyed reading &quot;Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen&quot;.  This is the first really good book he has written in years.  It is a collection of 4 essays that are a reflections by the author on his life thus far.  <br />The first essay and the last one are of general interst but it was the middle two that got me energized.  Those two are about his love of reading and his fascination with book collecting and book selling.  Although his tastes in literature differ from mine (how can anybody enjoy a multi-volumne set of a work by Proust?), his love of literature and the ownership of books gave me a sense of a kindred spirit.  I also discovered something very revealing; why his later works (this one excepted) took such a turn for the worse.  McMurtry talks about his heart surgury and his post-operative loss of interest in his profession.  He returns to writing but says it hasn't been the same.  Perhaps some of his readers have told him the same is true from our perspective.  For the record, his last book before the heart surgury was &quot;The Evening Star&quot; and I would say that most of his readers would agree that the real change in quality began there as well.  Hopefully, this exercise in self-examination will lead him back to the Old McMurtry.<br />The big joy was comparing notes as a book collector.  Having filled my nine bookcases some years ago, I go through the agony of pruning to make room for the new.  I related to the author's affection for different books more for their sentimental value than for their literary value.  I finally had to rummage Wallace's &quot;The Man&quot;.  It wasn't much of a book (who remembers it anymore?).  However, it was the first lengthy book I read as 6th grader just getting out of the juvenile sections.  Listening to McMurtry share his similar stories was heartwarming.  <br />The author gets a lot off his chest with a brevity of words and the reader feels thankful for the opportunity to listen.  No doubt you will find similar shared memories like I did.	2002-05-16

This was what I experienced when I started reading &quot;A Handful of Dust&quot;.  What is amazing is that Waugh has put so much into such a short novel.  There is a unique mixture of humor and drama in the life of a young British couple.  They represent the two divergent paths of British society in England between the wars.  The wife is a modern British woman who is what might be termed a &quot;flapper&quot; in this country.  &quot;Where's the party?&quot; would seem to be her motto.  The husband is a representative of the old school landed gentry whose estate is the focus of his attention.  We see them drift apart and then, just as we're focussed on their relationship, tragedy strikes and the novels takes a different turn.  The ensuing part of the novel takes a bizarre turn but ends with the author's reaffirmation of traditional British values.  The author's keen wit and sense of subtle imagery makes every page a real joy.  This is Waugh's masterpiece and is recommended to all readers.	2002-05-11

To me, he is the greatest short story writer of the 20th Century.  His stories often tell the tale of the Jewish communities in Poland in the 100 years prior to WWII.  As a result of Hitler's demonic policies, it is a society, a culture, that no longer exists.  Singer's short stories are a master study of individuals; their eccentricities and struggles in that society.  He has written of the present and he has written some excellent novels and novellas but his best work is in the Jewish communities in Poland.  In this autobiographical work, Singer gives us some more insights into that world through the eyes of a young boy observing his Rabbi father.  We start out with a number of recollections of individuals and their problems that were brought before his father.  These would easily fit within the short story motif that Singer excels in.  As the book get a bit past the midway point, the autobiographical nature comes to the fore-front and we eventually follow Isaac B in his early development into a young man.  This is interesting and very helpful to the student of Singer.  Its' shortcoming results from Singer's practice of keeping his own character, whenever present, in the background or as the story-teller.  When, in the final chapters, he is the main character, the quality of writing seems to drop a notch and suddenly, the book comes to an end.  First time readers of Singer might do better to start with one of his collections of short stories or, ironicaly, the sequel to this book, \\"More from My Father's Court\\".  Singer is always great but he is usually greater that he was in this book.	2002-05-09

The basic focus is on a group of ultra-orthodox Jews who set up a kosher meat-cutting business in little Postville, Iowa.  I lived for a number of years in nearby Decorah, Iowa so I was interested in reading it as soon as I heard of it.  I glanced at some of the reviews in Amazon and I could tell that the author has raised quite a bit of controversy over his approach to the subject.  What is interesting is that he is accused of being biased both for and against each side of the controversy.  Personally, I think he has done a good job of staying in a sort of middle ground approach.  Let's face it, his Jewish background was a strong point given our current societal tendency to blame differing opinions on racism, sexism, anti-semitism, etc.  Bloom is, thus, uniquely able to approach the subject unincumbered in ways that others would have been.  As one who is proud of his Iowa roots, I felt proud of the praise Bloom gave my home state and some defensiveness when he was critical of its' citizens.  I attended a junior high school in Des Moines that had two or three of the citie's synagogues in its' territory.  In or around 1967, the junior high school was spray-painted with hateful ant-semitic statements.  As I came to school that day, my reaction was one of great surprize.  This was something that was obviously the work of someone not in touch with the mainstream of thought in our community.  However, I learned that day that not all Iowans are perfect.  Mr. Bloom has reminded us of that (not that we REALLY think of ourselves that way).  <br />The interactions of the two societies; rural Middle-America and Orthodox Jewish, did not go well in little Postville.  The author ends up taking sides but only after a seemingly thorough attempt to hear both sides out.  I was surprized at the aloofness of the Jews in their new surroundings.  I knew that the local citizens would have done at least a reasonable job of making them feel at home if they had been given a chance.  I found myself having to realize a different perspective on Orthodox Jews.  I have read just about every book written by Isaac B. Singer and Sholom Aleichem.  I love the stories of the Jewish societies in Eastern Europe in the decades prior to WWII.  I always assumed that little mention was made of the Goyim because the Goyim didn't want anything to do with the Jews.  I now realize that there was a likely, unspoken, opposite point of view in which the Jews wanted nothing to do with the Goyim.  <br />In many ways this is a tragic story but it is also an illuminating story of our modern American society which prides itself on its' diversity.  To preach about assimulation as the method our ancesters followed ignores the seperation of different races and faiths that was the standard of the past.  Yet to try and praise an ethnic group that disavows all others but their own gives us a distaste that's hard to ignore.  Professor Bloom has written an excellent book.  His style of writing makes the reader glad that a person of his talent is teaching journalism.  You need not be Jewish or Iowan to get a lot out of this book; just American.	2002-04-21

Reading it in the setting of another culture, this point really struck me.  As a boy turning 17, there was much of interest to me throughout the book.  As a matter of fact, reading it is a good \\"coming of age\\" experience.  The fighting, the gambling, the swearing, the whoring....whew!  All that and a great plot, excellent characters, and a pathos that emerges from a sea of masculinity. I have read some books about WWII where I was disappointed to find that the first 600 pages were spent getting to know the characters and the last 20 pages were about the combat.  \\"Battle Cry\\" and \\"The Dirty Dozen\\" come to mind.  This fits the category as well but it wasn't a disappointment at all.  Indeed, it is better than Jones's \\"The Thin Red Line\\"; the \\"combat\\" book of the trilogy.  This is a story of military life on the eve of WWII in a world of misfit soldiers whose only future is tomorrow.  Over the years I have occasionally forgotten the names of the characters but I always remembered the name of the locale; the Schofield Barracks.  This is a story of the life that was lived in the drudgery before the chaos and heroism.  Despite what you may hear, it's not too long...	2002-03-25

It impressed me then and the memory of it has stayed with me.  I had previously read &quot;Babitt&quot; and &quot;Arrowsmith&quot; which were both good novels but neither compared to &quot;Main Street&quot;.  Both previous novels poked fun at small town middle America.  As a resident of North Dakota, I got a good chuckle over Lewis's portrayal of Arrowsmith's brief trip to our fair state.  My recollections of &quot;Babitt&quot; are that it was rather satirical in its' imagery of a shallow well-to-do man.  All of us could chuckle at him because he reminded us of so many people we knew.  The impact of &quot;Main Street&quot;, to me, is how we see the world through the eyes of the main character; the doctor's wife.   She is a real person dealing with real observations about real people in a real community.  Something in her clicks and says, &quot;this is all too shallow, too plastic, too predetermined&quot;.  We agree with her and yet feel somewhat uncomfortable in doing so because there is so much that she questions and much of it we have already accepted.  I was extremely impressed with Lewis's portrayal of this feminine character and how he chose her (as opposed, for example, to her husband) to be the eyes of his reality.  For that time and place, it was, I think, a bold move on the author's part.  And it works!  I remeber the impact of her questioning her relationship with her husband.  It almost seemed like a scene out of &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot;.  <br />This book was the one that made Lewis notorious in his own home town.  I expected to have to appreciate the times to be able to appreciate the book.  I found myself sensing issues and scenarios that are just as common and real today.  If you only have time for one book by America's first Nobel Prize-winning author, I recommend that you select this one to read.  You won't be sorry!	2002-03-21

I did so primarily because I was a real Bogart fan way back then.  I hadn't seen this particular movie at the time so the book was a whole new adventure for me.  And an adventure it was.  For years I was convinced that I, too, would eventually go gold mining in Mexico.  I would spend hours trying to think about how I would sneak all my gold back into the country.  Mind you, I don't believe I missed the point of the story even in my youth.  It is a brilliantly told tale of how greed can destroy a man.  Sounds simple enough but the beauty of the book lies in our being able to witness the gradual transformation of Fred C. Dobbs from a likeable, down-on-his-luck vagabond to a despicable, paranoid SOB who is obsessed with his gold.  It wasn't until years later that I came to appreciate the politics of the book.  As a social (not political) commentary it can stand alone.  It worked fine for me that way until I had read his Jungle Books and others novels.  Traven is an anarchist first and foremost and he articulates his case in all of his books; often in ways that may not seem readily apparent.  Looking back at \\"Treasure\\" with this perspective, the images of anachism suddenly seem clear.  We see three men down on their luck (read that to mean victims of industrialized society-two of the men were just cheated out of their pay after working, indirectly, for an oil company).  They form a pact among themselves and go away from society to make their fortune.  While away from society all is idyllic as the men work in harmony with each other, obeying the rules that they agreed on for themselves.  A crisis arises when one briefly returns to society for supplies.  When he returns, he is followed by others who corrupt the idyllic state.  Soon after, there are some indications of changes in Dobbs character but the true changes occur when the decision to return to society is made.  <br />Well, I'm no anarchist and you don't have to be either to enjoy this masterpiece.  That, by the way, is true about all of Traven's works.	2002-03-17
US	40051756	R2OCFHWQCFC9EB	0671753800	72444000	Leaving Cheyenne	Books	5	94	96	N	N	a unique concept well done	I read this book some years ago and I was very impressed.  I enjoyed just about all of Larry McMurtry's early (pre-Lonesome Dove) works.  Indeed, I felt that his three greatest works were &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;, &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;, and &quot;Leaving Cheyenne&quot;.  After &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;, I think McMurtry lost a lot of his sense of reality as a writer.  In &quot;Leaving Cheyenne&quot;, McMurtry tells a common enough love triangle story but in a most unique method.  The three characters tell their story from their perspective which, I'm sure, has been done before and probably with greater effect.  However, what makes this book special and all the more enjoyable is that each perspective is given from a different point in time.  Thus we have the serious young man's perspective, the pragmatic middle aged woman's perspective, and, finally, the fun-loving old geeser's perspective.  Bear in mind that these three characters are all essentially the same age but looking at their lives together from a different point of maturity.  It works, too.  With the serious young man we sense the cold, calculated mistakes of a driven youth.  With the pragmatic middle aged woman we see the acceptance that not everything works out the way you would want them to.  With the fun-loving old geeser, we see that life is not judged by past mistakes; it's judged by how much fun you're having right now.<br />I noted some very negative reviews on this book.

This is a first-hand account of the first major US battle of the Viet Nam conflict.  The author is the commanding officer of the conflict and, while he allows himself a bit of the glory, he makes his men the heroes of his combat history.  We get a reasonable amount of background of the events leading to the conflict and the units that will be engaged for the US.  This is helpful yet not overdone and we find ourselves following the troops into their field assignment.  They were hoping to engage the enemy and the battle began shortly after the first troops were land by helicopter.  The strength of this book is the way Colonel Moore takes us through the ensuing battle moment by moment.  If this sounds like it would be tedious reading, it isn't.  The US forces were facing numbers roughly five times their own and the combat was relentless.  We come to know many of the American GI's and, to his credit, Moore gives us the name of everyone involved no matter how brief his appearance in the book.  There is a helpful &quot;Where are they now&quot; section at the end that is much appreciated;  the reader goes through a lot with these men and most of us do want to know how their lives turned out.  As the one battle subsides and many are relieved, another battle soon erupts between the relieving forces and the enemy some distance away.  This battle gives us an even greater sense of presence in the combat. One battle is a great success while another is quite a different outcome.  Moore does a good job in evaluating why.  As a matter of fact, he does a good job of analyzing where we went wrong in our Vietnamese experience.  For those of us who came of age during this conflict, it might be hard to acknowledge some of the facts that he lays on us.  However, it isn't hard to find ourselves caught up in the courage and sacrifice of our troops.  Althoughit comes a generation or two too late, it felt good after all these years to chear for the good guys.	2002-03-04

I just finished reading this book and I will admit that I found it an easy book to read.  I remember watching a Game of the Week on NBC about the time Bart Giamati was selected as Baseball Commissioner.  I think it was Marv Albert who did a dugout interview with Whitey Herzog and there was much made of the apparent fact that Whitey was on the final list of candidates for Commissioner.  Although his Cardinals beat my beloved \\"Harvey's Wallbangers\\" in the 1982 World Series, they did it fair and square.  I had seen and heard enough about Herzog to look forward to his opinions on the state of Major League Baseball.  Whitey does have a lot of good ideas and I wish there was some way that Kennesaw Mountain Selig and his cronies could me made to take them seriously.  From the problems with youth baseball in America to the negative flipside of the recent home run explosion, Whitey had me agreeing with all of his insights.  There are, however, some short comings to the book.  First of all, it should be noted that Mr. Herzog had a co-writer.  This seems to be standard fare in sports books written by athletes and the theory is that the co-writer will edit the book into readable form.  I'm not sure how this book has been helped by the co-writer, Jonathon Pitts, who really must be the pits.  The down home folksy style is way overdone.  I challenge any reader to keep score because I think the word \\"ass\\" was used more in this book than the word \\"baseball\\".  Another problem was Whitey's grudges that he obviously can't let go of.  His attitude of the KC Royal owner Kaufman comes across like sour grapes.  Everyone who watched the 1985 World Series between St. Louis and Kansas City knows that the Cards got robbed.  They probably feel sorry for Whitey.  They can get over that sympathy by reading this book.  Whitey brings it up too often (the Denkinger call for those of you who missed it) and even suggests that it is the sole reason that he's not in the Baseball Hall of Fame.  Finally,I expected a better ending.  I can't believe the one they came up with.  Well, enough said.  I'm not from Missouri but you don't have to show me that Whitey Herzog was and is a great man of Baseball.  If you don't think so yourself then read his book.	2002-02-22

Everest Disaster	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Unforgetable	I write this review from a perspective of several years so I'll be short on specifics and long on impressions.  I will never go mountain climbing; the mere thought of it makes me quesy.  However, after reading this book, I went out and got the next two books that came out on the subject of this infamous incident.  Although the other two books were enjoyable, I realized that Krakauer's account IS the definitive story on the subject.  Haunting is the first adjective that comes to mind in describing his account.  His insights to the whole Everest experience was intriguing. I will always remember his well-phrased images of the piles of empty oxygen canisters (not to mention the accumulations of human waste) in this pristine location.  The reader gets all the essential background of what it is like to venture into this mystical locale including all the risks and affects of the altitude.  Krakauer makes you understand what it is like to have been there.  The various characters in the groups that climbed together were well developed and we find ourselves developing our own opinions of them.  The drama of the storm and the deaths at high altitude is compelling as is the rescue and the strange case of Beck Weathers.  What is hard to understand is that the author did it all in such a short book.  This book is an experience and one that you wouldn't want to miss.	2002-02-22
US	40051756	R1FQ417CZDUPEU	0396093205	188811904	Scandal (English and Japanese Edition)	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Good and Evil	I just finished \\"Scandal\\" by Shusaku Endo which makes it the third book I've read by this author.  All of the books have been excellent with \\"Silence\\" being my favorite.  Endo is a Christian Japanese author and \\"Scandal\\", like \\"Silence\\" give an insight to the theological questions that go through his mind.  The basic issue in Scandal is the relationship between good and evil in all of us.  The main character in the story is a Japanese Christian writer (this whole book is pretty autobiographical with little attempt to hide that fact).  At an awards ceremony he is confronted by the possibility that he has a double and that double has been spending a lot of time on the seedier side of life.  The actions of his double threaten his reputation and he searches out this \\"doppleganger\\" to resolve that threat.  Along the way he becomes interested in the nature and motives of the underworld people he comes in contact with.  <br />Mr. Endo poses a variety of questions for the reader.  As I previously mentioned, the main question is the level of good and evil in all of us.  He seems to suggest that those of us who worship Jesus have within us the potential to have been one of those who stoned Jesus on His way to the Cross.  While this is a shocking proposition to many, Endo's tale leaves one pondering the issue.<br />This book, like the other two I've read (including \\"The Sea and Poison\\"), is written in a compelling style that moves the reader along without any literary roadblocks.  Even though you may quess correctly at some of the outcome, you want to see how the author gets you there.  I rated this a \\"4\\" instead of a \\"5\\" because it fell a bit short of \\"Silence\\" so I knew he could do better.	2002-02-07

It is, to begin with, a fairly short novel; just over 200 pages.  I felt one of the problems with this book was that the author moved us around too much in time, place and character.  The brevity of the book made this confusing.  We're one place then another before we got settled in with the former.  The basic plot of the book is challenging but worth the effort to try and follow.  A doctor (Raphael)who was a youthful survivor of the Holocaust is trying to come to understand his experiences.  Through him we meet a wide array of characters of whom the most important is a man nicknamed Pedro.  Raphael is in a search for Pedro and for meaning to the horrors that are beyond meaning.  There is an irony in the duality of his search.  On one level Raphael searches for a real savior that he has lost.  On the other level, he searches for the savior that was never there.  In the end he encounters both.  We are left unfulfilled.  Having gone this far with him, we expect more.  We want a clear answer, a happy ending.  We get neither and, in this ambiguity, we get a sense of Holocaust reality; there is no meaning, there is no happy ending.  Night represents evil, day represents good.  In the twilight lies the madness.	2002-01-04

His &quot;The Mysterious Stranger&quot; got me through some tough times in college with the help of other books such as &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot;. &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; IS the Great American Novel. There is little left of his that I haven't read and just when you think you've read all his best stuff, another short story comes out of nowhere and totally amazes you with his insight. This is not one of those stories. However, it's not bad and it's a nice enough way to spend an hour or so. Bear in mind that the Preface and Afterword are together longer than the story itself. There is some nice information about Twain and the the times in which this story was written but it isn't essential that you read them. Twain had an idea of taking a basic, simple plot and having 20 or so other authors of his era write their version of the story. (OK, I DID get that much out of the Preface and Afterword). His motion, however, died for lack of a second and we are left with this; his briefly written entry. It reminded me a lot of his style in &quot;The Gilded Age&quot;. That book was too long and this book is too short but the story has an interesting twist to it. The moment I saw this book on the shelves I bought it and I have no regrets. If you're a fan of Twain's, you should buy it too. After all, if you act quickly, you too can have a first edition of Mark Twain.	2002-01-03

I just finished reading this book and I'm a bit uncertain how to appraise it.  To begin with, I bought this book in August of this year thinking it was primarily about Afghanistan in the 19th Century.  After September 11, I decided it would be a good book to read and it started out that way.  I had visions of &quot;The Man Who Would be King&quot; and other thoughts about the mystique of Afghanistan.  My curiosity was whetted and somewhat satisfied.  The subject matter then varied in time, subject and location and my interst somewhat waned.  I had to admit that the different topics fit within the general scope of the book but I had not anticipated reading so much on Tibet.  At first I was disappointed but I came to enjoy finding out so much about that part of Central Asia as well.  I even found myself renting the video of &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; in the midst of my reading.  However, at the end I felt that everything was somewhat disjointed.  It seemed to me that the authors wanted to clean things up in a hurry in the final chapter by getting back to a theme for the book.  I had heard about this book and one called &quot;The Great Game&quot; by Peter Hopkirk.  I found this one first and I came away thankful for all the information but wishing I had found Hopkirk first.	2001-12-31
US	40051756	RTDR1WKK1N9IJ	088254506X	449847619	Thousand Hour Day	Books	5	18	18	N	N	worth the wait	I owned this book for 30 years before I read it.  Every time I thought of giving it away or donating it to a book sale, I reminded myself that I have always been interested in knowing more about the German invasion of Poland; the official beginning of WWII.  I finally got around to reading it and it was worth the wait.  I had to keep in mind that the author is a Pole and so I presumed that he would have a biased approach to history.  That was OK for me because most historians just gloss over the Polish invasion leaving only a brief image of Polish calvary attacking German tanks.  This novel challenges our perceptions of this event in history.  The book describes chaos but it also describes successful Polish counterattacks and infliction of severe losses on the Germans.  I had to look up some of the history of this campaign to see if such things really happened.  The way the auther tells it, one might expect either side capable of victory.  This IS a fascinating book and I found myself engrossed almost from the beginning.  The main character is a Polish general who is politically out of favor at the start of the war but becomes a soberly insightful leader.  If the book has a weak point, it is the character of the general's son, Adam.  Exactly what the author was trying to capture with this character is confusing.  It may be that he was to serve as a symbol of Poland as a hostage that no one (i.e.England and France) cared or knew about.  Despite such distractions, the focus remains on Germany and Poland.  I was beginning to wonder if the Soviet invasion was ever going to materialize in this version.  I was three fourths finished with the book before the subject even came up.  In general the characters are varied and well developed.  The imagery is outstanding including and rape/murder early in the books that haunts the reader well after the novel is finished.  This book is out of print and will likely remain so but if you can find a copy, it is well worth reading.	2001-12-23

A few days after completing the book, I had a chance to meet a man named Dan Jones.  In the course of our conversation, the subject of his military service came up and I found out that he was in the 101 Airborne in WWII.  This immediately got me asking about the Market Garden operation where he was captured.  While I was recommending &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;, he was telling me about a book that his niece was publishing about his exploits as a POW.  I bought it when it came out thinking it was written by some college student with an expanded essay on her uncles misadventures in the war.  When I finally got around to reading it several years later, I found out just how wrong I was.  This is a GOOD book.  The events described cover the imprisonment of a number of US POW's, their struggles and their return to the US lines after the collapse and surrender of Nazi Germany.  There are so many different elements in this book including sex and murder and it is all expertly woven together in a way that leaves you wanting more.  The reader expects the stories of the poor treatment of the prisoners by the Germans but the most compelling part of the book comes later.  That is the story of the prisoners as they managed to work their way through the Soviet Army and back to their own lines.  The images of that journey are well conveyed and have stayed with me.  This book was a real sleeper for me.  I recommend it heartily.	2001-12-20

I have enjoyed most all of her novels but, after reading &quot;Dancing Girls&quot;, I was under the opinion that short stories were not her thing.  However, I believe the collection of stories in &quot;Wilderness Tips&quot; is one of her best works.  The stories are superb beginning with &quot;True Trash&quot; which takes us to a summer camp and introduces us to a young woman's secret and a younger man's sad lack of awareness of the life he's created.  It ends, or rather, evaporates leaving us with unrealized expectations.  &quot;Hairball&quot; is a marvelous story about revenge for a scorned affair.  &quot;The Bog Man&quot; is essentially the same subject matter.  &quot;Uncles&quot; is a beautiful story about the father figures in a girl's life.  Although she doesn't know her real father, she knows her uncles.  Their characters are somewhat undeveloped because it is their strength, not their personality that we need to understand.  We follow the life of the girl whose security is lost after the uncles are gone.  For me, the most compelling story is &quot;Death by Landscape&quot;. The story takes place at a summer camp and involves the lives of two girls who become attached after spending successive summers together.  The ending is bizarre and Atwood takes us beyond that and leaves us with eerie goosebumps.  The other stories are compelling and the reader finishes ready for more.  Margaret Atwood is a very gifted writer and may some day be awarded the Nobel Prize.  Her insights to femininity (as opposed to feminism) are a prime element of her genius.  If you haven't read Atwood, this would be an excellent introduction.  If you have read Atwood, then you'll be reading this anyway (if you haven't already).	2001-12-19

I was very impressed by both the story and the writing.  Tom Horn lived an exciting life and most of it took place in Arizona with the Apaches.  I don't know about you but I became familiar with his character in the Steve McQueen movie &quot;Tom Horn&quot;.  That movie centers on his life in Wyoming after his Arizona years.  After reading his autobiography, I am far more impressed with his life among the Apaches.  He tells his story well; not bragging but not leaving out important details either.  When that territory finally starts to settle down, he moves on to a job as a cattle detective in Wyoming.  He was found guilty of murdering a boy and he wrote this book as he awaited his death by hanging.  The book ends with his non-apologetic, non-whimpering statement of innocence.  The book is supplemented by an assortment of letters in testimony to his character and innocence.  It would have been nice for a brief summation and annalysis of the facts in his case.  He complained, for example, that he was misquoted by prejudicial observers while he was interviewed in a drunken state.  He seemed to me to protest more that his statement shouldn't have been accepted because of his inebriation.  He might better have explained why he would make suggestively self-incriminating statements at any time, drunk or sober.  Tom Horn was one of the last heroes of the Old West and his legend is magnified by the circumstances of his death while still a relatively young man.  This book gives the reader an insight to his greatness that the movies never did.	2001-12-13

Most German perspectives of WWII seem to be written by someone who wants you to know that they are one of the &quot;good guys&quot;.  In his books I have been given a glimpse of what it was like to be on the losing side.  In &quot;The Silent Angel&quot; we get a glimpse of what it is like to return to a home that doesn't really exist any more.  The vivid depictions in this novella are the works not only of one whose knows of what he speaks, but also of one gifted to tell the world.  Boll is no apologist for Germany but he conveys the world as he experienced it.  The destruction and the despair are overwhelming but there is hope in the relationship between the common sufferers.  Many will read this book in a single sitting but the impressions will last long afterwards.	2001-12-12

One hundred vignettes each taking place in a succesive year of the 20th Century and all told by a German Nobelist's perspective.  Germany is the locale for most of these stories but not for all.  I read this book on vacation and usually no more than one or two &quot;years&quot; at a sitting.  I kept myself busy the rest of the time with a larger work of non-fiction.  I think that approach helped because I'm not sure this is a book to be read from cover to cover in one or two sittings.  It probably can be but it would be like getting drunk on fine wine.  It's better to savor each sip.  There is a collective theme to the World War I years that involves discussions among Grass, Remarque and another author whose name escapes me. The rest of the time the stories are relevant to their respective year but the characters, topics, and themes are all unique. Some years are informative to life at that time through a German's eye, some are interesting, a few are rather forgettable, while some are in themselves worth the price of the book. I enjoyed Grass's &quot;Tin Drum&quot; but struggled through &quot;The Rat&quot;.  This book would be a great introduction to anyone wanting to find out why Gunter Grass won the Nobel Prize for Literature recently.  It will answer the question and leave the reader wanting to read more.	2001-12-11

His writing ability continues to shine through but his subject matter shows what was so disappointing about some of his later works.  I'm not what I would call an environmentalist.  I hunt occasionally as do most adult males in this part of the country.  However, the trophy killing described here and in &quot;The Green Hills of Africa&quot; is a bit much to take.  Many people might wonder at the irony of the main character also working as a game warden of sorts.  The female characterization here is also a typical Hemingway short-coming.  The female lead is just a little too dependent on Hemingway and doesn't seem to be bothered by his affairs with other women.  Hemingways women are always incomplete and totally dependent on his men.  The story line doesn't offer much except a life that must get boring after a few days and we're kept there a lot longer than that.  Still, even when the subject matter is as bad as this, it is something of a pleasure just to read Hemingway.	2001-12-10

I enjoyed this account of his other crew, the ones who were there to set up supply bases for the second half of his journey accross Antarctica.  This book was based on the personal accounts of the participants, some recently discovered.  It is a good overview of the Shacklton quest and it leaves the reader with a chill and an appreciation of the sacrifices these men suffered through.  It seems incomprehensible that some of these men survived at all.  Their ship disappeared in a storm leaving them with less than adequate provisions and no contact with the outside world.  I was surprized that Scott's shelters, built some years earlier, were still is satisfactory condition.  I discovered that it is best not to be in the same room where seal blubber is being fried.  I was impressed with the story of these men's determination to get the job done even though they surely knew that their names were not going to go down in history.  Of course, the reader is struck with the irony of knowing that their work was all to support a journey that would never take place.  I thought this story was well-told with imagery that gave us a sense of the privations of the men.	2001-12-09

My politics have mellowed over the years but I enjoy Traven's political perspective.  I believe B. Traven was an ararchist at heart.  He attacked big government and big business as evil but saw the uncorrupted individual as nobel and good.  In the rural Mexican Indian community he found, for himself, the most ideal form of government he had ever encountered.  His Jungle Books were a tale of conflict between good and evil; peasant and capitalism.  His book, The Bridge in the Jungle, is his ode to the Indian peasant community.  He brings us into their midst throught his vagabond American who stumbles upon a small village at the time a tragedy is unfolding.  A young boy has drowned and we witness their suffering and their coming together.  We see the corruption of their society by misunderstood influences from the outside world.  The example I remember best is the musician who, when asked to play something during the funeral march, comes up with &quot;Yes We have no Bananas&quot;.  Neither the musician nor anyone else except our American narrator comprehends the total inappropriateness of the song.  All in all, a beautiful story of a disappearing society.	2001-12-05

The reason for it is that I was always interested in the Spanish Civil War.  I always viewed that event as a microcosm of the politics of the 20th Century.  The problems with most histories of the event is that they don't fully cover the political spectrum.  Gironella presents a review of life in Spain leading up to the outbreak of rebellion.  In his use of characters, the reader is introduced to every faction involved; from anarchist to royalist and everything in between.  This personalization of the politics makes it all the more understandable and gives one an insight to the many conflicts within the conflict.  Yes, it's long but I didn't think so even after the second reading.	2001-12-01
