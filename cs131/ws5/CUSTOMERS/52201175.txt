At first, I was entertained by this book. Then, as I began diverting more attention to the content and focus of the book, I felt let down.<br /><br />I had just finished reading Mr. Kiyosaki's Four Quadrants, a spectacular book. I was expecting the same quality. Unfortunately, this book is not focused enough. It lacks the 'quality quotient' from the previous books I had read from the Rich Dad/Poor Dad Series.<br /><br />In a positive tone, I learned quite a bit from his imagery of comparing sales traits to different types of dogs.  The book provided great exercises that were easy to follow and they worked for changing my sales performance! It also provided me with a quick and easy reference about how to utilize and differentiate sales people responding in different situations.<br /><br />However, do not rely on this book. It misses quite a few important elements for sales that are relevant to the introduction provided by Mr. Kiyosaki, and the theme of this book. Continue the learning process about how to be a great salesperson.	2005-08-09

Whewie! I had many reservations about buying this book. The previous reviews made me skeptical, especially when I looked at the price tag and acknowledged the fact that I was going to bleed to death reading a blah-blah boring has-been couple of spineless professors rant about their lame memoirs and anecdotes lazily collected by one of their pet clones.<br /><br />To be precise, this book was written by two of the most influential consultants, professors and businessmen in the world. They worked with sales forces and represented companies of all sizes, in addition to being 'team-driven' by their own successful consultancy spanning thirty years.<br /><br />In many instances, they gained from the output of academia and collaborated their research with students associated from the prestigious Northwestern's J.K. Kellogg Graduate School of Management.<br /><br />This book has foundation, structure, conceptual analysis and excellent ideas for any student, manager-in-training or business executive who is trying to avoid the \\"art of selling\\" or \\"quick buck motivational\\" 'diaper-training series' collections (sold at newsstands everywhere).<br /><br />There are chapters from other excellent contributors related to Internet Strategies, Market Strategy and Segmentation. I found the material to be factual, concise and thoughtful.<br /><br />This is a rare book written about sales forces. Sales forces are the life-blood of ANY company. Your ability to communicate with people will increase your power, wealth and happiness. A sales force can easily become 'unruly beasts' because the sales force are people dealing with people. Great sales managers must understand CONCEPTS about how to FOCUS, CHANNEL and DISCIPLINE people without disrupting profitability...AND LOSING GREAT PEOPLE!!!<br /><br />\\"The Complete Guide to Accelerating Sales Force Performance provides education the way a textbook does, but it also provides guidance. It advises, similar to a manager's manual, and it seeks to provide the sales manager with an understanding of the entire sales force system by presenting frameworks for sales force design and performance enhancement.\\"<br /><br />Buckle Up!

Therefore, I submit this review for your respective analysis. The invaluable research completed by Loehr and Schwartz is remarkable! Regarding other reviews submitted for this book, I found them to be unremarkably shallow and maliciously hollow.<br /><br />An outrageously incredible coach will help build new skills, nourish changes, and reach goals for the corporate athlete; and remain with that person over an extended length of time to build consistency. Admittedly, there are other aspects to the 'overall state of the human psyche' such as having great parents, great spouse; perhaps a mentor, a sponsor, a guide and other supportive elements.<br /><br />Loehr and Schwartz have discovered that properly distributing positive energy is more important than managing time expended on a daily basis. The top-down performance pyramid model addresses the body, the emotions, the mind, and the spirit to reach the Ideal Performance State.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, to attain this level of consistency over the span of two or more decades for an executive is impossible. The research could be realistically applied for a world-class athlete since he or she has a much shorter time (and attention) span and the coach is still around.<br /><br />However, I will contradict myself now and submit that maybe, just maybe, it is possible. Here is my reasoning. Recently, I met a new group of world-class athletes who are challenging traditional rules. This new breed does not comprehend the word \\"NO\\" and the positive energy, reflected in diet, exercise, and mental agility is not only healthy but contagious.<br /><br />A few weeks ago, I also had the pleasure of meeting a 24-yr. Chinese-born executive who received her business training and experience in Germany. She is fluent in six languages. She owns three manufacturing plants in China, and she is the most aggressive human machine I have ever met. After rigorous negotiations and discussions, she is a powerful and wealthy woman on all levels.<br /><br />I noticed that she took periods to oscillate (rebuild her energy) after stressful negotiations. She closed her eyes, relaxed her muscles and meditated. Later, she told me that she imagined the experience of skydiving, or pretended that she was the heroine in a popular American movie, or she was focused on her next business 'conquest' (her word), planning every detail.<br /><br />During her normal workday, every 2 hours, I noticed that she would stop at whatever she was doing and take fifteen minute stretches, similar to the breaks taken by tennis players staring at their tennis rackets between volleys. Precise, disciplined and focused. Wow!<br /><br />I quickly noticed the similarities while reading this book, demonstrated by this remarkable woman. Spiritually, she had a keen sense of awareness and purpose. She found many different ways to tap into her positive energy.<br /><br />Is this 21st Century \\"shock-corporate/jock\\" material or what? This is a spectacular book for managing our \\"inner stage under the most difficult circumstances, and to emerge from stressful periods stronger, healthier, and eager for the next challenge.\\"<br /><br />[ADDITION TO REVIEW 12JAN06] Upon additional, admittedly amateur research, I believe this book is the beginning of a powerful movement about how people can manage energy and expand life.

In America, power and respect is gained by how much energy you can positively distribute in the period of a day.<br /><br />Do you plan to spend your nights having fun \\"all night long\\" with a flip-flop \\"entitlement\\" attitude towards success?<br /><br />Kiyosaki shook me \\"all night long\\" with his first book, Rich Dad, Poor Dad. I was expecting a litany of nutty \\"guru\\" suggestions. However, he provides concise examples of how we should prepare ourselves for a completely new set of rules called the Information Age.<br /><br />I had the distinct privilege of watching Mr. and Mrs. Kiyosaki speak at the Los Angeles Convention Center in Los Angeles. I assumed that he and his wife were going to be pretentious and arrogant. I was wrong. I should have remembered the cool and good-natured temperament of several of my friends from the great state of Hawaii. The Kiyosaki's have the same charm. I should have known that their presentation would be sincere, brilliant, simple to understand and passionate; not only about being wealthy, but also about being 'wealthy' with people, sharing and enjoying your life with others by having the power to make your own decisions. These are the simple fundamental themes they teach! And in America, we forget that we are not dependent on anyone but ourselves for our success. HUGE SHIFT IN MY THINKING!!!<br /><br />The Cashflow Quadrant does something phenomenally different than everything else I have encountered. Rather than delivering his assumptions in a boring chronological order, or in cut and paste boiler-plate fashion, he presents his ideas in four dimensions!<br /><br />Games and simulation software uses multi-dimensional training also. Mr. Kiyosaki offers games for gaining a better understanding of his four quandrants. Buy them! Complex topics are quickly absorbed and easier to comprehend. I believe this type of training is exceptional. It provided a diverse interaction that kept me actively engaged.<br /><br />Jump off the boat (Industrial Age), and sink or swim with the sharks in the Information Age.

It's called mediocrity	This is a \\"clumsy\\" book. My first impression was that it was written to deliver inconspicuously hidden messages to his irreverent friends. The next impression, as I sifted through his scruffy childhood, was that he did not possess any impressionable talent. Instead, he created a delusional rationale for writing such a book in the first place.<br /><br />I watched American Idol on television and was intrigued by Simon Cowell. I purchased the book to gain a better understanding about him, the celebrity industry, and his insightful `dynamo' concepts. Unfortunately, all I encountered throughout the book was a rambling hypocrite who, in the end, chastised everyone for pursuing celebrity status unless they were fortunate enough to be miraculously chosen by him.<br /><br />To be fair, American Idol is pure entertainment. Judging talent on time constraints and lurid subjectivity is the type of medium that will thrive in the spotlight. Millions devour the mindless intrigue.<br /><br />I have seen incredible performances. But those recitals live beyond the winds of subjectivity even when those artists display eccentric personalities, vitriolic egos...and being in the right place at the right time.<br /><br />One unfortunate theme oozing through Simon Crowell is his decision to export his ugly behavior from Britain to America. Perhaps it was already here, waiting for him and the timing could not have been more perfect since America must tolerate greedy politicians / corporations today with their ugly voter accountability / customer service.<br /><br />I am disheartened by the fact that Simon Cowell did not spend more time focusing on his talent and business prowess. It is undecided whether he a creative genius. Unfortunately, that is the theme for a better book for a more civilized world.	2005-06-12

Anyone who has ever had a passion for life, other than our daily dispositions, will covet the easy-to-grasp concepts about 'core values.' However, we all know, try with all our might, these concepts (virtues) are not that simple to master. It takes a lifetime of knowledge, information and experiences for us to bear the fruits of our existence. It takes a consistent flow of discipline!<br /><br />First, I want to heartily thank the honorable Zell Miller for his generous lust for life! All of my life, I have been searching for a mentor who I could respect with the brightest colors of honor, dignity, courageousness and passion. I read about them, but have never heard or seen one! (Boy would I love to meet him!!!)<br /><br />When I saw Zell Miller, as a Dixie Southern Democrat from Georgia, speak with a twang at the Republican National Convention on television; I could not hold the tears away from my eyes. I witnessed the greatest oratory in my life. The mastery and delivery of his speech put all the other presentations in the dump in comparison to his feisty 'rooster-calls.' 'Moral authority' and all his `core values' were oozing from the impeccable Zell Miller. I recognized in a heartbeat how quickly I would pick up my pistol (former Navy Corpsman, Reserves, and proudly attached to Marine Corps, Reserves) at his calling and fight with him to hell and back!<br /><br />This book is an affirmation of my 'corp beliefs.' It is a refresher course for virtues that almost disappeared due to strong influences from everyone else.<br /><br />America is reflected as a promise for a free society. A free society demands [broad'er] \\"characteristics which constitute the difference between a responsible and contributing human being and an unconscionable savage bent upon taking or destroying whatever they want that they are unable or unwilling to earn for themselves.\\" (Miller, p. 105)<br /><br />We should test our liberalism and our conservatism, as long as the human condition does not sway to anarchy and we do not get 'self-absorbed' by too many excesses in any direction.

Krannich are career planning specialists and travel experts who have numerous publications.  Buckle up for the rest of my review. It is quite unconventional!<br /><br />(Paraphrased from this point on)<br /><br />International job seekers are the ultimate risk-takers who are seldom obsessed with their careers.  Conventional career planning requires job seekers to first assess their skill, abilities, and work values, and then formulate a career strategy that will waste an entire life towards making money, career advancement, and hopefully, long-term employment.  It is now common knowledge that average long-term employment has been reduced to an average of 5 years.<br /><br />The absolute reality is that most job seekers, after spending incredible resources in time, effort and money, will often take any job offered to them and compromise their career goals and skills to...do as they're told, oops...match the requirements of particular jobs!<br /><br />The international job market does not respond well to conventional career planning designed around the American work ethic for career success.  Work ethics around the world are wonderfully different!  There are other variables to consider such as the similarities in the entertainment and the airline industry.  They are highly fragmented and segmented - a three-year contract is considered an excellent job opportunity.<br /><br />Few employment arenas are as exciting, rewarding, entrepreneurial, intriguing, mysterious, and fraught with mischief and misfits than in the global jungle.  There are very few people who are truly prepared to enter today's rapidly changing international environment.<br /><br />Strike out!!! on an adventure full of travel and heart-felt experiences while generating an income where one's job and personal growth merge into a lifestyle forever enriched.<br /><br />Before embarking on your worklife, begin with the traditional career planning books; second, turn to resume and interview books, and third, get all the conventional knowledge you can...before grabbing every shred of wisdom provided by the authors and examining in detail their many excellent publications.<br /><br />(Also read American Work Values, by Paul Bernstein and see my review.)edge you can...before grabbing every shred of wisdom provided by the authors and examining in detail their many excellent publications.

As Americans, we must learn how to avoid getting caught in the trap of reviewing trash.<br /><br />America is a nation of tolerance. We are reluctant conquerors. We prefer to enjoy ball games and eat BBQ with our families. Fortunately, shock radio jocks like my heroes, the brilliant Michael Savage and Howard Stern (everyone in my sights tuned in to listen to Stern on 911, and no one paid attention to the mainstream media that day...Stern was magnificent!) compel us to think. \\"Claiming detachment need not raise the issue of objectivity. It is a waste of breath to point out that every observer is in some way biased.\\" (Barzun)<br /><br />Come on folks! Knock knock, anyone home? There are too many respectable, highly decorated, hard working, and loyal Americans pouring their hearts out in this book. The political, racial and economic spectrum is well represented in the accounts. The men and women are leaders, coming from firm roots and strong moral authority. I find it extremely difficult to discredit them. They deserve the deepest respect as war heroes. They earned it!<br /><br />I have never seen so much hatred leveled towards an American President in my lifetime. Lincoln and Roosevelt had no exit strategies in their moments of crisis. We are a nation at war. I am convinced that our beloved President George W. Bush has protected all Americans by taking the fight to the enemy and doing his best to keep all of us safe.<br /><br />In contrast, I open-mindedly reviewed Fahrenheit 911 and found many inconsistencies. Apparently, Bush spent a few minutes maintaining his composure in front of a national audience contemplating an appropriate response to the terrorist attacks while Kerry spent an hour in idle and numb disbelief. I can splice and dice the facts also. Regrettably, people sucked it up like a `super-sized' candy bar.<br /><br />This book is about character, integrity and values. Read the stories of war heroes and judge for yourself. Decades after the Vietnam War, ghosts are coming back to haunt us all. In a sense this is a revival for most of us who are honorable and noble. Senator Kerry represents all the reasons illustrated in the book for why Americans simply cannot support him.<br /><br />May I suggest reading \\"From Dawn to Decadence\\" by Jacques Barzun, sold by Amazon, for an incredible vision for America.rity and values.

Such misleading comments will only damage a highly respectable profession.<br /><br /> Before reading this book, I was intimidated with a perception that financial planners were just another concoction of pesky stockbrokers reborn. When I began reading Chapter 2, I realized that becoming a Certified Financial Planner requires many years of acquired wisdom with scores of training to best understand the needs of their clients. Mastery is comparable to the same level of other respectable professions!<br /><br /> Rather than push product-centered transactions, services offered must be sophisticated, personal and accommodating to ensure long-term success. Now, subjective and objective targets must be met, along with technical prowess and imagination.<br /><br /> As a novice for this review, it seems that financial planning is still in the nascent stages. Therefore, anyone can be a Certified Financial Planner, an exhilarating but also frightening thought. I agree that this is the ultimate mid-career switch for the burned out CPA, attorney, stockbroker, or college-grad housewife.<br /><br /> This leading expert must publish a new edition to reflect the many changes occurring in a burgeoning, potentially volatile, financial service sector. The book was written right before the dot-com bubble bust, so financial planning does not seem to be taken seriously enough.<br /><br /> Jeffrey H. Rattiner portrays the profession in a warm-hearted position, similar to the motion picture Jerry Maguire, where the celebrity athlete is the only loyal client on a hard road to redemption and personal growth for both individuals and their families.	2004-07-26

Weiss is careful when to offer realistic scenarios, facts and features over and above the theory taught in school. The newcomer to this industry will be coached by a teacher from the \\"university of hard knocks,\\" learn about potential problems that will happen, and apply damage control when problems do arise.<br /><br />For example, rather than scrambling about on all the different steps to be taken before opening an import business (which raises costs), he wisely suggests how to quickly negotiate samples and just \\"send the money order, with your letter ordering samples, and by registered airmail\\" (keep initial costs low). He's right! There is always a chance that the exporter won't reply and you will lose your money. So what. Next time, use better judgment. It is part of the learning curve.<br /><br />Step one: Start VERY small. Do not get snarled on a maze of procedures.<br /><br />Step two: Take it slowly and be meticulous and methodical about your new enterprise by adding the proper pieces (record your costs!) that are necessary to do it right.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book! It is clear, concise, and a delight to read.<br /><br />[REVIEWER UPDATE 13JAN06] I launched a new business. This book has proven to be invaluable. If you begin with an entitlement attitude that someone owes you a living, or you believe in only working 9 - 5 hours, you will burn. You must have an entrepreneurial \\"shoot the prisoners\\" adventurous, but disciplined mentality. Initially, begin with your own hard work (once you are profitable, then delegate and hire experts for daily operations). Plan to be a 1-man circus. Then, you will be rewarded commensurate to the amount of risk you are willing to absorb.	2004-07-23

This book is yuck! Too basic. It depends on the reader to &quot;form a vision for Personal and Professional Success&quot; out of a set of very simple questions.  There is not enough reading material for the reader to properly answer the questions. Therefore, the poor reader is left alone 'reaching for the stars' for answers, which regrettably, will be WRONG!<br />1) The author expects the reader to &quot;convert strategies into action, by relying on support from family and friends!&quot; How many families in the world are qualified enough to patiently sit down with the reader over a year and professionally take the time to plan your future?<br />2) Consider the premise, &quot;learning how to think backwards from the future to achieve your goals&quot;...think about it; use common sense; and could this statement get any more ridiculous?<br />Worse, the author expects you to buy additional products! What a rip-off!  It is proper to charge for additional products beyond the scope of this book but it fails in that regard. This is a third-rate, insincere and delusional-material effort that will only discourage you.

Most of us surrender to the rat pack 'mentality of life.'<br /><br />Developing our own talents and cultivating a wonderful life is work of art. These magic moments are 'portraits of life.'  We can only paint the picture once. (Country Group: Alabama)<br />Creating a life is the art of human skill.  Art transforms what is. It is the creative impulse in every human heart.  The nature of our success will depend on the artistry of our actions from day to day, from sunrise to sunset.  Studying and mastering the art of achievement is the most significant element of success. (Aristotle)<br /><br />In our personal and vocational lives, there are an abundance of activities that we as Americans, can accomplish that go far beyond settling for just a good life.  Preferably, a meaningful life can be spectacular, even under the worse of conditions as long as one has a hand in creating something of extrinsic excellence that makes a contribution to life.<br />Robert T. Kiyosaki has written a brilliant book that challenges every free thinker about embracing life to the fullest.  He challenges us, as free spirits, to exercise our minds and body. Those who us who take responsibility for our own lives will do better than those who expect others to care for them.

And, even if we are, it still takes some time and practice to master basic fundamentals.<br />The author races through the chapters too quickly. Not enough review questions, and not enough basic explanations. He depends on the rules to summarize the chapters for brevity. Faulty assumption.<br />Nevertheless, and subjectively speaking, I gathered a confident 'head of steam' of mathematics well into the book. I felt competent mastering numbers, fractions, decimals, and basic conversions. Then, I slammed into Chapter 13, when the author explains basic algebra and introduces Mr. X (isolating x into equations).  Sadly, all my thought processes shut down and math phobia took charge.<br />Between Chapters 13 - 18, I encountered problems which I classified as Section 2. The author failed to discuss and illustrate pivotal points over fundamental mathematics. The rules are not enough to fully comprehend the long-handed process. One example 2x + x. This is one such example, not covered in the book, where the author needs to take a slight detour and explain how to interpret this.  Also, there are additional methods for solving algebraic equations, and some of them are easier to (re)learn.  The author needs to take a moment to discuss them. I found that using the easier methods (found in other books), and the long-handed method, gave me additional practice and clarity of concepts.

A Magnificent Story for all Ages	Forget the venerable motion picture with Judy Garland for a moment. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum is a glorious fantasy adventure that has truly become our first American fairy tale.  Written in 1900, every reader will be delighted by the author's ingenuity about how he captured the enthusiasm and optimism of America.  Overnight, he replaced the princes and princesses of Europe by introducing entirely new characters representing a fresh set of ideals and virtues.<br />Wisdom and love, courage and virtues in the characters comes from within. But for me, the greatest lesson I learned is \\"Nothing ventured, nothing gained.\\" To the scarecrow, \\"If Oz will not give you any brains, you will be no worse off than you are now.\\"  For parents, here is a rare opportunity to reach out to their children and regain the delicate balance between brain, heart and courage.<br />Baum was adamant about his belief that hard work should be properly rewarded thus further developing the premise of a free market. \\"In this country, everyone must pay for everything he gets.\\" For children, here is a rare opportunity to reach out to their parents and learn the basics.<br />In an excellent perspective by Peter Glassman (1987), in the traditional fairy tale, \\"the young maids or poor shepard lads are unaware of their royalty, only to discover it in the course of their adventures.  But, instead of unknown royalty, Baum give his characters unrealized virtues.\\"<br />Finally, according to Peter Glassman (1987), \\"the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Cowardly Lion each want what they believe will make them a better person, but Dorothy simply wants to go home.  \\"No matter how dreary and gray our homes are...there is no place like home.\\"<br />Buy this special edition and prominently display it. Then, devour the Marvelous Land of Oz and Ozma of Oz.	2004-01-28

Michener.  Take a closer look at the flow of words so it touches your soul:<br /><br />\\"These beautiful islands, waiting in the sun and storm, how much they seemed like beautiful women waiting for their men to come home at dusk, waiting for open arms and warm bodies and consolation.\\"<br /><br />This is a novel about the spirit and history of Hawaii. It was written when television first appeared in one-hour formats.  Michener wrote his first long novel amidst critics who believed the new medium 'would drive books into oblivion.'<br /><br />Read the first chapter thoroughly! The author wrote the first chapter to be difficult.  \\"He wanted to establish firmly in the reader's mind the physical setting and to weed out the ribbon clerks.\\"<br /><br />This is one of the greatest novels in America. I can tell you no more. I will not ruin your destiny. You will become part of the story about life. Read it!	2004-01-15

I agree with the author that this book \\"would fit well at the second-year level of a standard engineering curriculum.\\" As long as the reader understands algebra, trigonometry, and some elementary calculus, the material should be a 'touch and go.'<br />However, I was never a whiz at mathematics, so it took me a little longer to figure it out without a dozen professors nearby. If you are like me, don't be timid. The presentation is clear enough to gain a foothold and establish a critical bridge into the more sophisticated concepts, terminologies and technologies.	2004-01-04

The Year of Decision 1846 is the most defining portrayal of America's character. It is my favorite history book. I read this book every five years to gain a better perspective about this brilliant masterpiece.<br /><br />To paraphrase Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. (all quotations are his) in a foreword edition (1984), no other historical work about the westward movement comes closer in describing \\"the colors, sounds, smells of the Great Plains and of the Rockies beyond,\\" and of Manifest Destiny than this literary achievement. Devoto's wry wit and sagebrush humor pushes the reader even deeper into his story.<br /><br />This great novel closely portrays the ambition, the arrogance, the excitement, and the alienation of not only the greatest emerging country the world has even known, but reveals clear reflections of Devoto's persona himself. His conscience \\"continues to move us with tales splendidly and exactly told of our ancestors as they struggled in their valor and frailty against nature, the wilderness, and their own weaker selves.\\"<br /><br />\\"Devoto saw America as 'a system of social energies' at once pulled asunder by the 'centrifugal expansion of the frontier and the equal explosiveness of the developing industry' between the period of 1840's through the end of the Civil War, 'a terrible war that would redefine the American Republic.'\\"<br /><br />Devoto wrote exuberantly about the conquest of Mexico, but he was adroit about quoting Emerson: \\"The United States will conquer Mexico but it will be as the man swallows the arsenic which brings him down in turn. Mexico will poison us.\\"<br /><br />An excellent summation of Devoto's life is provided by Ann W. Engar who reasons that Devoto did not receive the critical attention he deserves, perhaps because he was so multitalented and often polemical. \\"Devoto was the unsparing critic when Americans failed to live up to the best standards of the Republic.\\" Many current historians note the remarkable parallels today in his writings. 'Pessimism is only the name that men of weak nerves give to wisdom.' Born in Utah in 1897 and one of Harvard's greatest, Devoto died in 1955 at the age of 58. \\"He knew the bitterness and triumph of life.\\"<br /><br />I always get a refreshing perspective in my life about the stress of current events when compared to the readiness and eagerness of earlier legends, when they faced extreme dangers. Engar reasonably concludes that Devoto's importance lies in his attempts in both fiction and historical writing to intepret the importance of the West in the development of American culture.<br /><br />Take your time reading this book and get rid of all distractions.parallels today in his writings.

I searched through every chapter to decipher how to make a profit with passenger, cargo, and/or other areas of air transportation. It covers a tremendous amount of information like aircraft configurations and technical designs. Unfortunately, and all so common, lots of problems given about aviation; but few solutions offered about profit strategies!<br />Each chapter technically covers an area of air transportation, but even the short chapters are not extensive enough. Only the most fundamental elements are written. There is not enough pertinent information delivered for the reader to absorb a firm understanding about air transportation.<br />The problem is that this 500 page book covers an awful lot of technical material. He selectively crammed it all into 500 pages. Some important elements are missing. The title of the book should be more concise about which audience the author wanted to attract, and spread all his great information into two brilliantly-written volumes.	2003-12-13

I have never given a one-star rating before. This book was hastily bundled together for all the wrong reasons. Yes, there are plenty of anecdotes and stories about customer service. Yes, there is a lot of common sense listed at the end of each chapter. Unfortunately, no real beef is offered on the plate.<br />The chapters are repetitive and disheveled. I have never read a book about Nordstroms, and now, I am not impressed about Nordstroms! At $10/hour, the low-wage salesman has to produce executive results or get fired.<br />Several of the examples given by the author, such as Gordon Bethune at Continental Airlines, does not adequately cover excellent customer service. By his own admission, Bethune discriminates between the levels of his frequent flyers. OOPS!<br />For the 5-star rating, I am extremely impressed by Concepts Worldwide, Mike's Carwashes, and especially W Hotels. They ARE the models to follow. Once again, the coverage does not accurately reflect the title and theme of the book.<br />Another problem with this book is that pages 179-194 are missing!

It is well written and I couldn't put the book down. While reading it, I squealed in delight because the author deliciously resonated warmth and sensuality. The author shares precious moments of society in Guaymas which I gobbled up and will think about for a long time.<br />The author in his youth was an educated anthropologist. He makes vivid distinctions between right and wrong, being American and being Mexican.<br />The author admits that he &quot;novelized&quot; the story in significant ways, therefore, it is difficult to ascertain how much blame he should accept for lovely Lupita.  He loves her early in the story, yet he neglects her, along with the rest of his chummy locals.  Not much cultural difference at that level.<br />If the story had been pure fiction, I would instantly award the 5-star rating because it was extremely intense and alive. If the story was entirely true, I am sad that Lupita put her fate into the hands of a foolish man.	2003-10-25

The 'smoking gun back at my face' was how it converged so well with the comments given on the first page at the beginning of the book! Here it is:<br /><br />In our personal and professional lives, there are an abundance of activities that we, as individuals, can accomplish that go far beyond settling for just a good life. Preferably, a meaningful life can be spectacular, even under the worse set of conditions, as long as one has 'a hand in creating something of intrinsic excellence that makes a contribution' to life. FABULOUS!<br /><br />This book reflects the extensive and timely research done over the period of ten years. Luckily, I read this book first. It is the 'prequel' to \\"Built to Last,\\" written earlier. Jim Collins did his best to gather and report his data in empirical form, but remember the precision of how the statistics were collected and determined. This is just a subjective test. A defensive football coach may know that the other team passes on the fourth down, only 2 yards to go for the goal line, 85% of the time, and may still lose the game against the same team every year.<br /><br />Applying a different perspective (and please don't send me back to grade school), let's play in my sand box:<br /><br />1) The book finally settled on 11 finalists that survived all the rigorous filters and tests. Does that mean that the rest of the companies, including Microsoft, failed? Hardly! What about all the companies that did not attract enough notice from the media and public scrutiny? On another note. Jim Collins has become part of the 'enlightened establishment.' Incredibly intelligent and talented people surround him. His dynamo wife is a truly phenomenal woman. Even Jim Collins admits 'she had the genetics!' BAM! That is your reality and what an excellent life (WooHOO)! What about the rest of us lower mortals?<br /><br />2) It is unrealistic to get a 'partnership made in heaven' for the 'WHO, then WHAT' by getting the right people on the bus. Granted, matches like HP occur, and love at first sight is common. But, like marriages, most do not endure the test of time. However, consider expanding upon the analogy illustrated in the book.<br /><br />If the clean bus has a clearly marked sign indicated where it is going and even has a high-tech-electronically lit neon sign to flash alternate messages that indicate the street it is taking to get there (and the bus is marked with the name of the driver delicately stenciled next to the door along with a polished and attractive state-of-the-art coin machine to take and dispense the correct change), this is the strategy and vision of the bus driver (leader). The messages, signals and a few rules are clear to the person before jumping on the bus. This person can also get off the bus at the next stop. Only at this point is it prudent to select the right people to stay on the bus and to arrange them to sit at the right seat until the last stop to the beach for the sunset party.<br /><br />3) It is unrealistic to recruit enough Level 5 leaders into positions of power. They are simply overlooked. The Board and investors who deliberately pick the 'Celebrity Hogs' rarely consider them. I truly wish we had more Abraham Lincoln's!<br /><br />4) Technology should appear at the beginning of the entire process along with strategy. It must not be fully deployed because the needs are not completely known. However, it must be available at all times, at each process to accellerate the value of the company.<br /><br />This is an excellent book. It answers many difficult questions. It provides superb analytical thought and does a fantastic job reporting startling results. This is not a fad book. It should be required reading for all entrepreneurs who wish to shape the future and improve the quality of work in our lives.get a 'partnership made in heaven' for the 'WHO, then WHAT' by getting the right people on the bus.

It appears he will not have any difficulty converging his sheer tenacity and skill into the final chapters of globalization. Richard Branson is regulated by his own set of rules. Institutions were forced to recognize him as a serious contender. Even today, he uses incredible charisma and vision to strike in the United States and Australia. The CEO at Quantas ridiculed Richard Branson as a circus act. His critics should be more thoughtful as they are now seen as the laughing stock.<br />Throughout the next century, questions will be asked whether Richard Branson made the world a better and happier place. The answer is a resounding and unequivocable, YES. He has the will and the capacity to do whatever his heart desires. That ability is nerve-racking since he wipes out competitors, large and small, that have spent decades refining their products and services. These companies are led by people who are suppose to be the best trained pedigree in the world!<br />Let us not confuse skill and luck. Rather, let's compare Sir Richard to Genghis Khan. Along with their music, they 'danced the beat' about sex and power and didn't mind saying so. Still, it is both shocking and refreshing to read about Sir Richard's exploits growing up. How he languished as a child but created the will to challenge the world is stunning! He has an uncanny sense of timing and strategies for masterfully positioning himself.<br />Many times, Sir Richard was extremely reckless in pursuit of his dreams. In most situations, his unconventional wisdom prevailed but his male psyche was triggered by conquest and conquer, regardless of the cost. Oh please, he could be vicious so stop pretending. My simple advice, along with others who care for his success and health, is to kiss more babies, flatter your allies and increase the share of bounty. Govern by consent (you certainly have an incredible ability to select great managers that love you) and balance your impulses.<br />Whether he has the desire and the ambition to leave us his legacy will be forthcoming and, hopefully, explained in his second biography. I have watched Richard Branson through the years. In a wicked sense, I can understand why the Czars of Russia and other leaders got rid of their advisors. After a while, leaders become isolated. I know this because as a huge dreamer on a smaller scaler, it has become impossible to contact him to do business.at love you) and balance your impulses.<br />Whether he has the desire and the ambition to leave us his legacy will be forthcoming and, hopefully, explained in his second biography.

This is a glorious book embodying the absolute finest work done by William Shatner. In a wonderful tribute to exploration, he trips, stumbles and collapses through his own confusion. But, as the Captain who I grew up to respect and admire, he bravely embarks on a voyage of discovery and adventure. He boldly goes where few have ventured before.<br />Seriously, he clarified many thoughts, ideas, concepts, facts and fiction. Frankly, I am surprised that he was able to make any sense out of it and teach me. I tried my best to read about relativity, time, sub-atomic molecules and atoms, and space travel because it fascinates me. I regret to inform the Captain that I have been assimilated into your collective as a minion.<br />In fact, Mr. Shatner covers topics including nanotechnology, robotics and a host of health, age and other previously unknown by-products! You must read the entire book. It's not a light-weight book by any stretch of the imagination. ABSOLUTELY BREATHTAKING WHERE WE ARE GOING DURING THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS.  The more sophisticated literature is beyond my comprehension, therefore, this book is the perfect learning device!<br />Since I was a boy, my father always grimaced when I steadfastly watched the original Star Trek series. He told me that Captain Kirk, Spock, McCoy and all the incredible space-bunnies were brainwashing me. Today, my children are amazed as I sit motionless, stuck in time, and oblivious to anything else, (time warp?...did I flunk already?) as I get my coordinates correct to watch another exciting episode of Enterprise. I am delighted with the current Star Trek series, Enterprise. It bridges the gap between today, the past, and the future.<br />Captain Kirk (oops Mr. Shatner) expounds on this topic and presents a brilliant discussion about our humanity and how technology is going to make our lives easier. This book is extremely interesting to read for comparison between all the science fiction and actual technology developed today in such a short period of time. Our global society is converging between virtual reality and literal reality.<br />The entire Star Trek adventure has shown the world endless possibilities. The Star Trek adventure promotes our unique love, curiosity and sometimes, even higher levels of intelligence and understanding.<br />\\"Fantasmic\\" worlds exist among us.

I purchased this book on the premise that Michael Mandel, being a senior business editor at Business Week, would have phenomenal insights about the growing uncertainty in our society. He presents a beautiful synopsis with excellent facts and figures. He summarizes that regardless of what an individual experiences, as an \\"idiosyncratic risk\\" group, or a \\"structural risk\\" group (meaning selective termination notices or termination based on complete industry shut-down), the American economy will continue to grow.<br />Such factors include government policy, international trade, corporate restructuring, overseas manufacturing, improved education, entrepreneurs and other measurements such as health and insurance products. According to Mandel, the objective is to minimize risk in our society by improving our economic prospects, as a nation, in the global economy.<br />Unfortunately, this is where brilliance 'tumbles off the cliff.' As expected (determined from the deteriorating progression of the chapters), several of his examples are fatally flawed. Several of his forecasts are fundamentally in error along with inaccurate facts and figures, and I found myself in denial, desperately searching for his expert recommendations. I was even willing to accept a few cheap answers to all his carefully illustrated points!<br />For example, Mandel raves about how spectacular salaries in the future are tied to individuals choosing aspiring technology careers, yet he admits this career path is extremely unstable. He also states that the Wal-Marts and other 'mature' industries are stable but low-paying (relatively speaking to the following examples). First, since when does McDonalds, and now Boeing, have time and resources to be complacent and provide stability to its work force? Didn't Wal-Mart challenge the complacent industries? What about Airbus and the debate about subsidies for both aerospace firms? Which of the two 'risktakers' (high-paid unstable v low-paid stable) possess the better credit rating? Which group can afford the mortgage on the new house, the car payments, and the new computers?<br />Furthermore, what happens if a student, a 'risktaker' based on his conditions and tolerance of risk, obtains a significant amount of training and the industry disappears or the network established turns out not to guarantee employment because he or she went to a second-tier or third-tier school? Let's be honest about who gets anointed to the best jobs, regardless of talent! In other words, there is nothing stable in this economy. What if? What if? Cheap shot!<br />Also, Mandel's treatment of total quality management is alarming. He says \\"the problem is that the transferred responsibility under a TQM system increases pressure on workers and managers.\\" Yeah, so where's the problem? That is a POSITIVE manifestation for improving accountability and instilling pride on the individual in the workplace!<br />I hope Mandel writes another book to wrap up PART 1, The High Risk Society, because I am convinced it will sell extremely well, and finally, he can provide us with his expert recommendations.better credit rating?

He is one of the few CEO's (before Jack Welch :) who had the boldness, bordering on foolishness, to take huge risks. He had 'safer' options available to him but he earned his salary by pioneering the expansion of product-service development beyond aircraft; maneuvering past the notion that market share is everything; and shifting emphasis to a value organization nurturing the best customer service in the world for the business traveler under extremely competitive conditions. Surprisingly, he made SAS profitable over and above everyone's expectations, including his own!<br />Carlzon presented a clearly defined strategy and it was effectively communicated to the stakeholders and employees, focused internally and externally, in equal portions. Carlzon took the innovative step of training his workforce to take responsibility for reaching goals, directing managers to support and encourage \\"frontline\\" employees to make decisions normally reserved, and maintain a steady work environment that was flexible enough to immediately respond to pursuing quality customer service.<br />At the time Carlzon wrote this book, the timing was before the rapid expansion of powerhouse Southwest Airlines. He focused on the best technology, concentrated on the type of aircraft, upgraded systems at the airport and improved distribution systems, which were key elements towards a profitable company. On the technology side, Robert Crandall, former CEO at American Airlines proved technology was related to profitability when he introduced the Sabre yield/reservations system.<br />Among the legends of aviation, Jan Carlzon, Robert Crandall and Herb Kelleher propelled the airline industry into a future that remains obscure. However, with the right dose of courage, discipline (wisdom) and imagination, the search for corporate excellence is not restricted to the little 'blue'-suited (I really mean green) men sitting in the Ivory Towers.<br />One final point.

(hehehe) The fact that wizards like Tom Peters and Ken Blanchard would wholesale themselves!<br />What gives Southwest it's incredible impact upon the airline industry is their strong culture and people power. This enables them to be the 'price leader,' but they get uppity and lose traction when it comes to performance as a 'value leader.' Don't get me wrong. Southwest Airlines is the only U.S. carrier to be profitable every year since 1973. They have been extremely successful at forcing the rest of the industry to restructure, be more competitive and provide better service in their markets. Herb Kelleher had to combat several adversaries to stay in business to succeed. He has become a legend in the industry.<br />There are critics who believe Southwest is a 'cattle-car' airline. Believe it or not, there are experts who will concur that the reason their performance is so great is because they do not have anything to offer in the first place, except price.<br /><br />Southwest Airlines cannot be everything to all people. They supply a niche that only works in large markets. It is sheer hell to fly from Orlando to San Diego. It took four stops! If I got stuck in-between legs, too bad. I was on my own for the night. The same aircraft that started in Providence had restrooms that decomposed and did not get cleaned until arrival at the final destination in Portland. And whew, it smelled! This is due to the quick turnarounds that MANAGEMENT enforces. The flight attendants tossed jerky-treats to everyone while they huddled in the back of the plane with bags of food from Burger King and oversized ice-cold drinks. Sorry, but I recall not too many people on that flight felt it was exceptional customer service. This type of service is common enough to see for yourself.<br />The authors are not balanced on the issue of customer service. Airlines such as US Airways and Delta Airlines provide fabulous service. If they didn't, they would be out of business. Don't be too quick to condemn the majors! Yes, the infrastructure of the majors is flawed, and they will go out of business, but for different reasons. The point is not to shoot arrows at them without better analysis.<br />The book would have been more valuable had there been more analysis. The authors had no right to interlace their own philosophy and value system into a book that was suppose to highlight Southwest Airlines and Herb Kelleher. It had the potential to be a great business book. There are valuable morsels of peanuts tossed thoughout the book. There are some great moments and some wonderful pictures, provided you don't develop an allergic reaction.led! This is due to the quick turnarounds that MANAGEMENT enforces.

I keep asking myself (for the first time in my life) why can't people work smarter, not harder in America? Unfortunately, this issue must be resolved by reading other books since the author did not faithfully address this important topic.<br />This book has an incredible number of footnotes backed up with an exorbitant amount of pages pointing to other references. I found the book to be extremely difficult to read. I had to review chapters over and over again, to figure out what the author was trying to explain. Some very important parts were simply \\"glossed over.\\" There are sections throughout the book that require proofreading for the next edition because it is repetitive and not carefully organized.<br />Credit must be given to the author for the extremely valuable gems that I did synthesize from the book. It was worth it. However, please condense it into fifty pages. This is a wonderful book!	2003-05-03

I agree with the author that \\"a venture business combines both high risk and the potential for high reward.\\" The main emphasis, lost among aspiring start-ups, \\"is to work consistently at increasing the size of the prize and reducing the risk.\\"<br />This is the most concise and direct book I have read concerning how a start-up company can bridge the gap between the seed/research/development/concept stage (aka idea, first-half early phase) to the start-up stage (aka beta testing, second-half early phase).<br />This book will save years of headaches and frustration; however, reviewing other sources and articles about this topic is necessary to gain a better understanding and appreciation about what the author is writing about. Consider additional reading material, for balance, such as Gerald Benjamin's 'Angel Financing' and Ray Smilor's 'Daring Visionaries.'<br />This book is written for the \\"accomplished\\" individual. I am inclined to believe that academic and formal training are also required to successfully coordinate with the progression of this book.	2003-01-05

One has to be blinded by this glowing image of equality, however, not to see that private [boarding] schools, in general, represent an elite alternative to the public educational system in much the same way that private cars are alternatives to public transportation.\\"<br /><br />Even though this book was published in 1985, most of the research and analysis of the elite schools still apply today. The different types of boarding schools across the United States are illuminating. Take the time to know the differences.<br /><br />There is the impression that boarding schools are for delinquents, second-rated and spoiled children. Positively, not the case. Children entering their teenage years must be mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually disciplined for an entirely new experience away from home; or get suspended or expelled quickly.<br /><br />The book gives a fair review about how several public schools are even producing a growing number of eligible candidates for the Ivy League schools, although in many ways, the authors believe they still remain at a significant disadvantage.<br /><br />Although attending a private boarding school is no guarantee for admittance to Harvard, it certainly does provide a \\"booster shot\\" for incredible success. Every parent should read this book.<br /><br />For example, Portsmouth Abbey School is located near Newport, Rhode Island. Considerations included: 1) children leaving the nest early; 2) a safe, but not necessarily comfortable learning environment; 3) equality between the boys and girls; 4) the ability of the children to seize opportunities; and get 5) access / exposure to all the information / people / network in the World.<br /><br />Plan accordingly while your child is in kindergarten.

I got prepared to read a motivational book that would not go beyond my short-term memory.<br />Entrepreneurs are a special breed. I agree that anyone with the desire, training and savvy can accomplish anything once the person is committed to it. Entrepreneurs are leaders, managers, learners and followers. Leadership and management are subsets of entrepreneurship. Mr. Smilor was correct when he admonished the dean at a leading business school. Schools today are only teaching students what they ought to know when they should also be training students on what to do! Entrepreneurs inspire people, create wealth and improve society in America. These are just a few of the many topics covered in short, but very concise chapters.<br />May I offer a suggestion for the entrepreneur who is just getting started or for the burned-out entrepreneur who has been in the trenches too long (that's me!). Skim the book like the first class taken in a post-graduate degree program. Make this book the first step in the long and winding process. I can assure you that many issues covered will not be fully absorbed the first time. Then, before presenting the start-up to investors, carefully review the book again, as the last step, to make sure you covered all the bases. You will get a new outlook and gain an entirely new appreciation for this book.<br />One final point. It demands total commitment and takes the ultimate sacrifice to be an entrepreneur. It is a gut-wrenching experience...	2002-04-04

The Fourth Edition is an updated and important text for people with whom need basic principles in marketing and management explained as it applies to the airline industry.<br />Airline Marketing and Management is a gem because it carefully breaks down major marketing and promotion concepts all the way down to smaller segments with great examples.<br />This book is a classic.  Readers will get an indepth understanding of aviation and, surprisingly, why the airline industry is still in shambles today.  It covers the intricacies of product design and development, pricing and revenue management, pricing and revenue management, distribution channels, and selling and advertising policies.<br />Many of the &quot;tried and proven time after time&quot; principles are, for the most part, still ignored by airline managers today. The author is diligent in his effort to examine &quot;time-proven principles.&quot;<br />This is a marketing book about the fundamentals.  Can't move on until you got them down!	2002-03-09

Respectively, none of them work unless you are starting a mom-and-pop business.  Believe me, I've gone through most of them!  I have found that they are either based on a mom-and-pop &quot;boilerplate business plan&quot; start-up model or based from outer space, with grand delusions  of fantasy by thinking that the start-up will rivet the attention of a venture capital firm or an investment banker.  Forget it, those days are gone.<br />If you are serious about finding and raising private equity for your start-up company, this book will give you plenty of facts, stories and anecdotes.  Angel Financing will also give you the methods and processes to get it done properly.<br />Promote your idea into a practical one.  This book is pure common sense.  Write a business plan to attract financing.  The blueprint for operating your company is the next step.  Look around and discover that Gerald Benjamin is a pioneer in this field and his views about how to raise private equity is gaining a foothold and turning heads.  Recently, I attended one of his seminars and the people sitting next to me were simply top-caliber entrepreneurs.<br />There are very few companies that will ever make it to the public equity markets.  For example, many large companies such as SAIC (headquartered in San Diego) are employee-owned.  Just look at the facts presented in his book and reconsider your options, especially if you would like to retain control of your start-up.<br />I have one suggestion.  Carefully review the how-to-do a business plan material out there.  Make sure it is suitable for what you are doing, or you are going to go through many sleepless nights like I did.

I am glad Lupe became much stronger than that.  The author portrays the mother as a wise woman, yet she only managed to solve the problems of strangers.  She couldn't even begin to solve the problems of her own hapless family and all of their misguided conduct.<br /><br />Hopefully, most Americans of Mexican descent believe in the notion that to get ahead means not to flagrantly break just some of the rules. There are generations of Americans of Mexican descent, with whom possess incredible virtues and have done incredible acts of heroism for their families.  They easily surpass the achievements of Salvador's and Lupe's family. They are the stories to be told. Attempting to exemplify and characterize these two families as a representation of things to come for the Mexicans in California is simply another gesture of humiliation and embarrassment for me.<br /><br />The book has some value in that it explains more clearly the need for Mexicans in California to get educated and to, as hard as it seems, play 'smart' (by the rules) to get ahead. There is a message that is not clearly delivered by the author.  It is not \\"who you are\\" that counts, it is \\"what you are\\" that makes the person. So, whether you are a professional with a college degree or a migrant worker, keep your head up high, acquire knowledge and make great decisions.<br /><br />It boggles the mind to ascertain the reasons for publishing this book.  It is not clearly written.  The poor description of certain leading characters, the hyperbole and the metaphors get absorbed, sooner or later, into illusory abstracts. The author should have given more thought about the impact and the influence he is making upon readers, particularly Americans of Mexican descent.<br /><br />As a proud American of Mexican descent, this book does not support my aspirations in life. I want Mr. Villasenor to succeed, along with his family. I wish all Americans of Mexican descent to flourish. This is not the way to reach me.t.

The presentation and illustrations are not always clear. It is hastily bundled together in an attempt to impress the reader about a few innovative thoughts (developed by others) and rearranged by an amateur writer. The book has two themes: how to prepare a business plan to an investor, and learning how and where to obtain financing.<br />First, if anyone dares to write his or her business plan HIS way, beware, you will be rebuffed quickly! Second, if you carefully review the writer's experience at raising capital, he seems to contradict his own methods for raising capital. Case in point: Mark Long sponsors lectures about how to make &quot;quantum leaps&quot; for entrepreneurs, yet he struggles, in one of his own projects, to raise just $350,000 of seed capital from forty-five investors!<br />Do not use this as a primary guide. For the one star rating, there are some ideas that may help focus your thoughts. Use this book as an auxilliary tool to complement your ideas and visions for preparing final plans and strategies.	2001-12-13
