Having read this when it was new and I was young, I may have \\"impressed\\" on it like a baby chick, but this tale of the war- and magic-crossed protagonists, one a noble maiden who seeks her independence, the other the magically mutated scion of another duchy, still resonates with me.  How they face prejudice, betrayal, war, and other Shakespearean-class plot complications continues to appeal.<br /><br />I recently purchased a second-hand hardcover edition of this, to make up for my worn-to-falling-apart paperback.  It's a pity it's out of print.	2005-09-14

The individual stories are fine ones, but the combination robs the oddity of ... well, its oddity.<br /><br />Still, a decent Wolfe book is always worth it. Good stuff.	2005-09-14
US	52245316	R34UQN0LCDFAVH	1402544766	845366857	His Excellency: George Washington	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Not a saint, but a true hero	A methodical and well-crafted biography of Washington, portraying him neither as demigod nor demogogue, but as a strong, heroic man with occasional feet of clay, someone who well deserves to be considered the Hero of the Revolutionary War and the Father of His Country, but who was also possessed of both a temper and an aggrieved sense of sleights from others, as well as a fear of ridicule and poor reputation that drove him as much as any noble commitment to revolution and principle.  Headstrong in battle, Washington was still the best and most effective military leader of the Revolution, and his careful style and insistence on stepping aside when the time was right (versus become the military dictator that some feared and many expected) entitle him to much of the admiration that subsequent generations have given him.  An excellent review of the Revolutionary period and the First Presidency.<br /><br />This unabridged 13 CDs (vs. 352pp) audiobook proceeds at a decent pace, and Runger's narration is clear and even, almost, but never quite, to the point of being soporific.	2005-09-14

Or, for that matter, interesting characters, compelling plotting, or much reason to finish, let alone pick up the succeeding editions of the Dirigent Mercenary Corps series.  Young cadet on his first tour faces a not-very-mysteriously-motivated civil conflict.  Slogging ensues. Not bad, just numbingly pedestrian and routine.	2005-09-14

Jefferson: The Tumultuous Election of 1800	Books	5	6	6	N	Y	A tale of the Revolution and its ultimate conclusion	While the focus is on the critical election (the first truly contested Presidential election that led, eventually, to a peaceful transfer of power in the nascent Republic) this book spends considerable time providing biographies of the principals -- Adams, Jefferson, Pinkney, Burr, Hamilton, and others -- involved in the contest.  It gives extensive and understandable background to the conflict between the Federalists and the new Republicans -- a conflict whose rhetoric made the elections of 2000 and 2004 look like the calmest of civil debates (albeit the modern candidates couldn't hold a candle to those in 1800).  Political dirty tricks, statehouse maneuverings, and a flawed electoral process defined in the Constitution ended up sending the election to the House of Representatives, where further furious deal-making and political chicanery barely led to our not ending up with a President Burr ...<br /><br />Again, another fine, clear tale of the Revolutionary Era and the election that served as its \\"consummation,\\" both proving that the Republic could endure and setting the grounds for the Jeffersonian Republican dynasty that so profoundly shaped American history.<br /><br />This unabridged 10 CDs (vs. 260pp) book is well narrated by Jack Garrett, who brings a newscaster's flare to the conflicted tale he tells.	2005-09-14

For three-quarters of the book, the only differences between the two are the insertion here of scenes (from the TV show) of the Battle of Serenity Valley, and Simon trying to convince his parents that something is wrong with River, and even that is played with very straightforwardly.<br /><br />The problem is, with an adaptation of a movie like this, what the fans (or even the interested) want is something that provides some extra depth, added details, background from Joss translated into novel form, whatever.  Instead, we get something that neither adds to nor detracts from the movie -- the screenplay without the visuals, which ends up making it fairly ho-hum.  Even in the last quarter, when we begin to get some perspective work, the book remains fairly unilluminating.<br /><br />My recommendation?  Purchase \\"Serenity: The Official Visual Guide\\" -- and get both the screenplay *and* copious photos *and* notes from Joss.	2005-09-14

Though I could do without the poetry, the prose simply rocks, juxtaposing the normal with the magical (and often the dark) in a gripping fashion.

The biggest of these is the presentation. Schiff is breathless. Every sentence practically screams for an exclamation point, cranked up to 11 whether it needs to be or not. Every paragraph drips with absolutes and hyperbole, and the facts are gaily festooned to obscurity with metaphor and simile. Rather than be presented with the events of Franklin's stay, we are meant to be incessantly transported by them.  That's useful on occasion, but exhausting and counterproductive over the length of the book.<br /><br />This effect is aided and abetted, though not caused, by the dramatic reading of Jason Culp, who comes across as an enthusiastic DJ to Schiff's prose, introducing Franklin's life like it was the next item in the Top Ten Countdown. Culp's reading is clear but rapid (though with a lack of gaps between some sentences that sounds like a recording artifact), and his use of accents and voices for the major players is only occasionally distracting.<br /><br />Schiff's book also comes across in an odd stream-of-consciousness fashion - not quite chronological, but also not thematic. Things happen, players come and go, events occur, Franklin acts or reacts. There's little that draws the narrative together, minimal analysis or relationship from one part of the tale to the other, aside from the introduction and conclusion. As a result, the final picture of Franklin, the other cast, and the events themselves, feels muddied and indistinct. In some ways, that probably echoes how the mission itself went, but as a retelling it left me somewhat relieved as I popped the last disc in.	2005-07-12

I got a copy (softcover) in the airport book shop in Glasgow on business, and it became her instant favorite bed time story.<br /><br />While I agree to a degree with the reviewer above that complains about too many unpolished points (the book reads, sometimes, like a trimmed-down version of a longer tale), there's still an absurd logic to the whole thing.

Folks die on both sides, and the action hurtles forward even with repeated and frequent digression issues on one or another cast member's past, or the past of the Opal itself.  This is epic comic writing in a class of its own, with more backstory and foreshadowing than you can shake a cosmic rod at.  Though it's way late in coming, I applaud DC for (3-4 years later) reprinting it. One more volume, and we should be set (and ready to reread the whole thing again).	2004-10-15

Various Marvel key players are incarnated at the end of the Elizabethan age, and they're faced with the end of the world as they know it.

US	52245316	R2GUIM7IQ92THV	0743479564	300233020	JMS Unplugged	Books	4	40	40	N	Y	Good, but predicatable	While &quot;some&quot; of these tales have been previously printed in _Tales from the New Twilight Zone_, they all have that flavor -- the setup, the odd goings-on, the twist, the strangely just conclusion.  The bad guys get theirs, and the good guys, too, perhaps with a bit of poignancy tossed in.  It's the formula that Rod Serling (and, even better, Richard Matheson) honed to a sharp edge during the orignal run of TZ, and JMS picks it up and runs with it admirably.<br />That, perhaps, is the primary problem with this collection.  The stories end up feeling formulaic, and once you assume that there will be a twist ending, you end up spending more time trying to figure out what it will be than enjoying the trip there.<br />I recommend this book for JMS fans, and TZ fans, and for folks who Like That Sort of Thing.  But it's not Joe's most imaginative or intelligent work.  No regrets for having bought it, and I'm sure I'll pull it down off the shelf again, but I'm not going to send out copies of it at Christms, either.<br />Note: While the book is actually titled _Straczynski Unplugged_, Amazon continues to list it under the proposed title _JMS Unplugged_.  The (rather washed-out) cover shot shows the correct title.	2004-06-09

His Spencer is erudite and dry, really done quite well.<br />He does less well, though, with the other rolls.  Hawk's accept is different every time he speaks.  Susan and the other women sound -- well, anything but sexy.  And I'm sure that, even with the \\"unabridged\\" label, there would have been some way to elide out the over-repetitive \\"he said\\"/\\"I said\\" bits of dialog -- what works well on the printed page is horribly distracting when read aloud.<br />All that said, so to speak, it's a decent enough Spencer tale -- a \\"Magnificent Seven\\" with Spencer in the lead (and Hawk as Yul Brynner).  A light and frothy audio book quite suitable for commute time.	2004-05-21

While nowhere near the personal intensity of the earlier Parker works, it's a definite cut above the other novels he's been cranking out of late.<br />The difference between then and now -- aside from the author having found a successful formula and just coasting with it -- is that the early Spenser had internal doubts, struggles, and passions unrequited.  The current Spenser is happy with himself, happy with his work, happy with his relationship with Susan, and deeply content -- which, gun-toting mobs, dangerous gangsters, and treacherous townsfolk aside, means there's not much *there* there in this first person narration.<br />It was disturbingly enjoyable to see all the different &quot;deadly hoodlums&quot; that Spenser has encountered and learned to respect gathered up here to help liberate the town of Potshot.  It was helpful to see that they were not all carbon copies of each other -- though sometimes the differences are little more than handful of cardboard mannerisms.  The disturbing part comes in when you realize what sort of legbreakers, shooters and button-men these guys really are, and how easily Spenser puts that out of his head while dealing with them.<br />Folks who enjoy Parker will enjoy Potshot.  Folks who haven't ever encountered the author before will, hopefully, be driven to some of his earlier work after they go through this one.	2002-10-02

Like Heinlein's last few works (everything starting with _Number of the Beast_), the Callahan series has (d)evolved into tales of Extraordinarily Talented and Witty People, (over)laden with cultural in-jokes, references to earlier tales, and a twee jolliness that makes for light, breezy reading when it's not just irritating.  Robinson has seemingly fallen into the &quot;How do I trump what I did last time?&quot; trap, and while it's nice to see the old gang again, hear the awful puns, and sit back for the ride, I look back on the much warmer, more *human* early Callahan tales (and even tales of Lady Sally's House) and miss them.<br />I don't regret having bought the book, even at today's exorbitant paperback prices.  I just wish I'd enjoyed it as much as his earlier ones.	2002-09-05

Facts are presented with little relationship to each other, and very little of a negative or human nature is passed along. Chronology is more or less tossed out the window.  Particular works are referred to out of order, and rarely is much detail given about the shows themselves, or Webb's creative choices.  Anecdotes are chock-a-block with each other, with paragraphs inserted, apparently at random, of laundry lists of Webb's cars, or his favorite foods.<br />Excessive space is given to mini-biographies of some of the major players in Webb's life -- and contributors to the book.  Do we really need to know the genesis of Bobby Troup's &quot;Get Your Kicks on Route 66&quot; in a biography of Jack Webb?<br />The book's notes and bibliography are extensive, and it's clear the authors had good access to any number of important people.

David manages to run him through one situation after another to reinforce this impression, allowing Apropos to demonstrate, over and over, that he's a selfish manipulator who would betray a friend at the drop of a hat.<br />And yet ...<br />We can all relate to Apropos.  I think most people wish, sometimes, that we could allow the bitterness of the past to rule our present actions, that we could use the excuse of &quot;Well, other folks screwed me, so I'm gonna screw other folks first&quot; to justify being right bastards to each other. If anyone has such an excuse, it's Apropos.<br />Therefore, that at times Apropos rises above his selfishness and self-serving ways to actually do good -- sometimes inadvertently, sometimes seized by a destructive fit of morality, sometimes because ... it's the right thing to do -- keeps this book from being a mere celebration of an anti-hero and gives us the same hope that we can rise above our own pettiness and greed, no matter how good the excuses for it are that we carry with us.<br />I'm not sure how soon I'll revisit Apropos.  But I'll remember the final lessons he teaches.	2001-08-22

The selection of quotations is idiosyncratic at best.  A movie quotation should either be able to stand on its own, be a statement of some strength if one has seen the move, or, at least, be evocative of the movie itself.  I'd say about 10% of the quotations given here really qualify, based on the movies in the book which I've seen.  Indeed, based on just those movies, the book omits many major gems (just a single quote from _The Manchurian Candidate_, for example), while tossing in what seem to be almost random pebbles from many others.<br />Another weakness to the book is that, while an interchange of a few lines is usually enough to give the context of a quotation, in most cases this book gives just a single line, explaining the context in the citation.<br />Even more irritating is that quotes are cited to the actors, not the characters (though their characters are described in the first citation in each movie).  That makes for some odd reading at times.<br />That having been said, given 6,000 quotes (&quot;provocative&quot; or not), there are bound to be some goodies you've not run across, and there were a number I dogeared for later transcription.  I've definitely run across worse specialty quotation books out there.<br />(And, for the record, the book does actually list both the screenwriters and the original sources, despite one of the other reviews in this section.)<br />Is it worth the cover price?  Probably not.  But at a discount, second-hand, or from the library, it's worth a read.  The type is easy on the eyes, at the very least, and if nothing else, it just might inspire you to go out and rent one of the films it quotes.	2000-12-31
