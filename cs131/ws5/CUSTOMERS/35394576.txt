Rowling moves away from unmitigated happy endings, the better and more mature her series gets.  There is a reason that movies like Chinatown and Requiem for a Dream are so critically acclaimed, a reason why Empire Strikes back is widely considered the best of the series: dark and unhappy make for a more powerful story than light and fluffy.<br /><br />Now that is not meant to take anything away from Rowling's previous works; they are all wonderful, but as they get progressively darker they get better.  It is my firm beleif that she has topped herself with each outing, and naturally that makes Order of the Phoenix the best one.  Gone is the nurturing womb of Hogwarts: in Book 5 tyranny and evil reign in the school.  Sure in Books 2 and 4 a great majority of the school had a problem with Harry, even despised him at times, but never before has the feeling of oppression been so thick.<br /><br />The Ministry of Magic, so desperate to protect the status quo and not admit what is right in front of their eyes (the beginning of a war, see Great Britain circa 1938-9) has turned everyone against Harry, and by installing an agent in the school he cannot seek much solace from Hogwarts.  Things get steadily worse until all of the teachers he could call allies are gone, and he goes to the Department of Mysteries to help his godfather.<br /><br />Now, in all the previous books Harry did something unbeleivably heroic at the end of the story, and here he does nothing of the sort.  He allows emotion to overrun logic, he walks right into a carefully prepared trap and endangers the life of dozens.  His actions lead directly to the death of his godfather...and this is why the book is great.  This is no longer a series in which in the hero conquers the odds every time, this is a darker and more mature series.<br /><br />Don't hate it because it doesn't make you feel so happy 10/10	2005-01-22

Now don't just give me a non-helpful vote cause I didn't like the book, at least hear me out.  I like King...a lot.  He was one of best American authors in the latter half of the 20th Century, and has churned out thriller after thriller that are rightfully critically acclaimed.  However, no matter how much I like a particular author, I judge each book individually, and this is not a good book.<br /><br />Characterization is one of the things that makes King more than Dean Koontz: he develops his characters to the point where the reader really cares what's happening to them.  In addition, if you pardon the cliche, his books are \\"tightly-plotted,\\" moving quickly from situation to situation and keeping the reader involved.  Both of these crucial developments are missing in Pet Sematary, none of the main characters are well developed, and so when terrible things begin to happen the reader remains more detached than involved.  In addition, supporting characters are brought in at times when the plot calls for it and then thrown away, without ever being developed at all.<br /><br />The plot is also surprisingly flimsy for a King novel, used only as a clothesline to hang scary and macabre situations on, instead of supporting the novel itself.  The actions by the characters often don't make sense, especially at the climax of the book, and the wonderfully set-up \\"Pet Sematary\\" itself is inexplicably abandoned in favor of the place \\"beyond\\" the Pet Cemetary over the big dead tree.<br /><br />Look I wanted to like this, I really did, but it's a poor piece of writing that people like because it's macabre and written by Steven King.  3/10	2004-10-29

There are movies and books that you realize are well done, but they just rubbed you the wrong way.  Then there are works like the King of Torts, which you realize are just plain awful.<br /><br />I read on the inside cover of the King of Torts a blurb about how a public defender was taking on the case of a seemingly assuredly guilty murder suspect.  Ahhh, said I, virgin territory for Grisham.  Through brilliant legal work the protagonist will foil a seemingly airtight case.  Alas, the book was nothing like that.  Now, the blurb-writer is not to blame, for trying to summarize the plot of this book is like trying to hold water in a sieve.  Suddenly people are throwing money at J. Clay Carter, offering him millions of dollars to start a lawfirm and get paid millions for settling easy cases (something that, no doubt, occurs often in the real world).  This mysterious character keeps sending him cases that make him millions, earn him a beautiful girlfriend, millions of dollars worth in luxury items, and the title of the King of Torts.  Then everything goes downhill, including a baffling scene in which the main character is beaten and in the hospital and his friends look at him and start laughing at him, and eventually J. Clay Carter is left with nothing, except his old girlfriend who comes back to him when he has been sufficiently humbled.  Of course, the book ends with the typical Grisham, \\"Character leaves his hometown, never to practise law again.\\"<br /><br />Huh?  What?  Why?  Is this some modern retelling of the story of Job?  Was Grisham just not rich enough and had to churn out filth for a quick million?  Who is the mysterious character who takes it upon himself to make Carter a millionaire?  Where is this book going...did it go anywhere?  How could any book possibly make The Summons look decent.  Two words: look elsewhere.  1/10ns look decent.  Two words: look elsewhere.  1/10	2004-10-28

For Trisha McFarlane isn't just dealing with how to build a fire or find berries to eat, she must stuggle to maintain her sanity and deal with the knowledge that something is stalking her.<br /><br />The more I read this book, the more I liked it.  I read it once and thought it was decent; I read it twice and thought it was spectacular.  The second time I read it I looked past all the references about the \\"sub-audible\\" and looked at the extremely well-developed character of Trisha.  I realized that the fact that she listens to the broadcasts of the Red Sox is not a ham-handed attempt for Red Sox fan King to worm his allegiance into a story, but Trisha's only connection with the outside world and other humans.<br /><br />There are plenty of the traditional elements to a \\"child lost in the woods\\" story; obviously Tina is going to have to find food, water, and a way back to humanity, but it is the psychological and horror elements that make the story soar.  Tina's growing detachment with reality is perfectly depicted, as is her growing knowledge that not only is there a creature stalking her...but it is no creature known to man.  A good story well told, I can't imagine why it wasn't better received.  9/10	2004-10-28

Although I often critize Grisham for ending his novels too similarly (riding off into the sunset, never to practise law again...), anything would have been preferable to the way this book ends.  To make matters worse, the story is actually halfway decent until the ending.  Now you're probably thinking, \\"Why James, surely you jest!  It is preferable to have a decent book with a cruddy ending than a cruddy book through and through.\\"  I would actually have preferred the book to have been lousy through and through, because as it was it generated just enough tension for me to actually care about the answer to the question the book revolves around.  Instead, Grisham picks the worst possible character, the worst possible reason, and the worst possible motives.  Look elsewhere...please.  3.5/10	2004-10-28
US	35394576	R1C69ASHFSLBKK	0671039725	769595666	Carrie	Books	4	2	3	N	N	A fun read, originally told by a young King	The story of Carrie White, although not told conventionally, is a fast and fun read, if not one of King's best.<br /><br />Carrie White is the student you probably remember from one of your schooling experiences: the plump outcast who never achieved any semblance of popularity and remained something of an outcast from the clique-based social hierarchy.  I remember a girl like Carrie White well, albeit in elementary school not High School.  King developes Carrie well, a character to be sympathized with but not pitied, a somewhat lowly character but not a pathetic one.  Character development is also important in the characterization of Carrie's mother, who cannot be made too evil or over-the-top while still being oppressive, and King strays close to the line without going over.<br /><br />But then again, people rarely talk about the characterization in a King novel, so I suppose I must devote time to the sci-fi element: Carrie White is a telekenetic, capable of moving objects with her mind.  Like Ramona Quimby in Roald Dahl's children's book \\"Ramona\\", Carrie begins to train herself and develop her powers, until she is capable of essentially everything, something she proves in the tour-de-force latter third of the novel.<br /><br />As mentioned, Carrie is not told conventially.  King abandons the traditional novel format and instead tells the story as if it really happened, citing invented scientific studies, autobiographies, eye-witnesses, police reports and interveiws.  This either adds to or detracts from the novel, depending on your opinion.  I'm on the fence; while on one hand this is certainly fresh, on the other it seems perhaps King did not have enough material to fill a traditonal novel and resorted to this format instead.  Similarily, I am tempted to give the book 5 stars, but the negative part of me is going to prevail, if only because the specific event that leads to Carrie's unleashing of her power seems poorly thought out for such a significant event.  7.5/10t.  7.5/10	2004-10-28
US	35394576	RIZHDJNKP4R6J	0451161351	381306153	Cujo	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Delivers tension, but flawed	Contrivance is typically something that authors try to avoid, but obviously most stories and movies will have some element of coincidence or contrivance in them; it's inevitable.  However, Cujo goes way beyond the occasional contrivance: the entire book is built on one coincidence after another, to the point in which several events are put into motion by the biggest coincidence of all: a winning lottery ticket.  Suspension of disbeleif is no longer possible by the end of the book, and the reader is frustrated.  In addition, no mention is made of why the villain, Cujo, has supernatural powers or what powers he has.  A thin line is drawn to a murderer in the town where most of the action takes place, (no doubt from another King novel) but I beleive books must be self-sustaining.  In addition, the inclusion of one character, an exceedingly annoying and frustrating character who has an affair with the protagonist's wife, is included for no real reason except to function as a red herring for the police (not even a red herring for the reader, we know he is not guilty).<br /><br />Normally when you say \\"Person X must have been on cocaine when he wrote this\\" it is used as a joke, but not here.  By his own admission (don't beleive me, read \\"On Writing\\") King was doing several lines of coke a day while writing this, and perhaps some of the book's faults can be attributed to that.  However, Cujo is by no means a poor read.  It develops a lot of tension, has a menacing victim, suitably sympathetic victims, a decent conclusion and likeable enough characters.  It just misses the mark a little.  5.5/10	2004-10-28

From a character study to humor to power struggles, this novel has many different themes to read and enjoy.<br /><br />Chief Bromden is a 6'8\\" powerfully built Native American on the outside, but inside he's a scared child, paranoid of machinery that runs through the world that only he can see.  He is the narrator to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and it is through his eyes that we see the story unfold.  Almost all the action takes place in an Oregon Mental Institution, where 40 inmates troll under the autocreatic command of the Big Nurse.  But then Randle P. McMurphy is admitted, a loudmouthed con man only there to escape the drudgery of the work farm.  He quickly realizes what is happening and begins to challenge the nurse's authority, giving hope and sanity to the inmates at the same time.<br /><br />As long as you're not put off by the constant repitition of mechanical images about the \\"Combine\\" that only the main character can see (bear in mind he is insane) you'll see what a beautiful book this is.  You'll see how McMurphy (for once a savior is not a blatant reference to Christ) becomes more than just a source of entertainment to the men, how he enriches their lives and sets them free, how the more he acts against the Big Nurse the less mechanics Chief sees.  If you didn't read it in High School, by all means, read it now.  8.5/10	2004-10-17

It is as fast as it is gruesome, and engaging as it is original.  The characters are beleivable and interesting, the buildup wonderful and the payoff rewarding.  I have no qualms with this book whatsoever, and highly reccomend it to everyone aside from those with a weak stomach.  9/10	2004-10-16

I emphathized with the main character, Elisa Ben Abuyah, because he (like myself) was raised to be a Jew and ended up going on a search for truth that he could not find in religion.  I was expecting that this would be a piece of propaganda, that Elisha would discover by the end of the book the way of the Lord, yada yada yada, and would go back to the Jews and be welcomed with open-arms and live happily ever after.  Suffice to say that did not happen.<br /><br />The characters, beyond Elisha, are not developed terribly well and the dialogue is often perfucntory and merely serving to announce a character's feelings or advance the plot, but this is still a commendable book.  The ending is very good and in keeping with the spirit and tone of the novel (although based upon historical characters and times this is a piece of fiction), the historical setting is vividly depicted, and as mentioned, the book is very open-minded and worthy of a read.  8/10	2004-10-06
US	35394576	R1RL6XV0CMMHWB	0451204158	562316613	Black Sunday	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Fast-paced and tighly plotted	For starters, I would like to address the ignorant and non-sensical complaints by some reveiwers that this book does not feature Hannibal Lector and is dissimilar to Harris's other works: shut up ignorant reveiwers.  Must an author write all his novels off the same characters? Would an author that made all his books the same be a good author? No; Thomas Harris is a very good author because of his ability to create beleivable pyschopaths who are almost sympathetic.  Hannibal Lector is a supporting character and works very well as one.  Now, on to Black Sunday<br /><br />Black Sunday is argubly the most intelligent action book I've read.  The plot is simple: Michael Lander wishes to blow up a signifigant amount of explosives in the United States.  He has Palestinian assistance and a very unstable mind.  David Kabakov is a member of the Mossad, the Israeli Secret Service.  He knows very little about Lander's plans but must stop him at all costs.  Time is short, and the stakes are huge.<br /><br />What makes Black Sunday great, not just good, is its ability to transcend the action novel format and develop orginal and intensely beleivable characters.  In telling about psychotic Michael Lander, Harris does not fall back upon the standard \\"abused as a child and therefore crazy\\" cliche; he creates a backstory that is convincing and saddening.  Major David Kabakov is not the epitome of good or heroic but he is willing to do whatever it takes to get the mission accomplished and is intensely likeable.  It doesn't take much to get the reader rooting for him<br /><br />To sum things up, I highly reccomend this near flawless book.  The action sequences are engaging, the love-story not obligatory or carelessly handled, the human element present and the ending uncertain until the very last.  9.5/10	2004-10-02

From the disaster of Dunkirk to the siege of Leningrad, from the pivotal Battle of the Coral Sea to the systematic genocide of the Jews and other peoples, this book has it all.  It remains as objective as possible in telling the facts without resorting to rationalization (e.g. there is no attempted mitigation of atrocities).<br /><br />I honestly can say that I have read few more interesting books, and it is certainly the best non-fiction book I have ever chanced upon, telling one of the greatest stories the world has ever known with the utmost clarity.  10/10	2004-10-01

Now read this description of the book:<br /><br />An albino, like his dead father, is convinced that a 3000 inning game took place 80-some years ago between the Chicago Cubs and the Iowa baseball Confederacy All-stars.  The albino is somehow able to go back in time and witness the game (as a matter of fact the local hicks use him as a good-luck charm and rub his head before stepping to the plate, allowing him to remain in the dugout) in all its glory. Then Teddy Roosevelt shows up and takesa few swings, telling the pitcher not to patronize him after throwing an easy pitch, and then making a cheap pun about the bat being a \\"big stick.\\"  Soon after that Leonardo DaVinci showed up in a balloon and watches a few innings.  Shortly thereafter a giant flood occurs and some of the players spontaeneouly throw themselves in the waters.  To fill the vacancies, a statue of an angel plays in the outfield.<br /><br />There, I think I've covered all the bases, so to speak.  Oh, I forgot the Native America named \\"Drifting Away\\" who is messing with the reality of this county and eventually plays in the game too.<br /><br />Look, I don't like to be so completely negative, but the book was ludicrous.  To make matters worse, it throws in a fairly gratuitous love interest who is the spitting image of the Albino protagonist's mother (kinda Fruedian) and more seemingly random things than could possibly be mentioned in this review. And bear in mind, reading these things, that I'm a baseball fan.<br /><br />3/10	2004-09-25

Try not to associate the book with the movie, as they are very dissimilar.  The movie tends towards action, whereas the two action sequences in the book bookend the story of Johnny Rico's rise through the military (and ironically, the action sequences are probably the more boring and poorer written parts of the story.)<br /><br />The war is not explained in too great detail, but at least Heinlein has a reason for it: the story is told from the point of veiw of a grunt, and he is told as little as possible in the event of capture.  The story of Rico's rise, from boot camp to Officer's candidate school, from his tough-as-nails drill sargeant to his overbearing captain, is very interesting and worth the price of the novel, as long as you can stomach the propaganda and deal with one gut-wrenchingly melodramatic moment in the middle of the novel.<br /><br />A decent read, and certainly never boring.  7/10	2004-09-25

I do not understand why.&quot; writes Winston Smith in his diary in George Orwell's classic dystopian future novel, 1984.  The same could be said for this book, in which the Chinese launch an overwhelming and highly disciplined attack on half the world before finally assaulting the United States.  I understand that building motives is difficult, (I myself attempted to write about a war in the United States and gave up, lacking a suitable motive) for wars typically have complex reasons for getting started, with the notable exception of World War One, when there really wasn't any solid motive.  However, perhaps Harry was correct in not putting any motive at all nstead of a flimsy one.<br />Thankfully, the battle scenes are so well-crafted, following the combat unit of Stephanie Roberts as they retreat from Alabama to Georgia to the Carolinas and keep retreating as the Chinese pour more and more troops into the battle.  More scenes follow Stephanie's father, United States President Bill Baker, as he tries to man the defense of his country while silent enemies plan a coup in the name of America's future.  Meanwhile, Special Forces Sniper Jim Hart stays behind Chinese lines, doing his best to disrupt the enemy and stay alive.  A last story follows some of the higher-ups in the Chinese army and politics, and is not nearly as effective as the other stories.  The narrative grinds to a halt whenever Han Wushi or Han Zhemin come into the story, which is not only boring but convoluted as Harry tries and fails to weave a rift between the Chinese civilan leadership and military.<br />Moreover, these four stories lead into an ending that is more along the lines of a soap-opera than a military page-turner, inducing more cringes than cheers of victory.<br />So how, asks the reader of this reveiw, could I have given this book four stars?

If I could, I would give this book three and a half stars, but I cannot so therefore I'm going to have to go with my heart and give it three.  John Grisham is quite an author as far as churning out engaging bits of prose goes, and that's what this book is, entertainment.  This doesn't have the characters or catharsis of the Rainmaker, the suspense and adrenaline of The Firm, or the gripping plot of A Time to Kill; the book is pure entertainment, the literary equivalent of a summer movie- it doesn't really go anywhere but it's fun just to enjoy it while it lasts.<br />  Typically I have a short plot description in my reveiws, but that's where I am drawing a blank.  You see, Grisham found a way to traverse over 300 pages without any real semblance of a plot.  This is more a story of 9-years in the life of a particular character, Willie Traynor.  The book is told from his perspective, in the first person, but yet it is missing the human element that was present in one of Grisham's previous 1st-person efforts, the Rainmaker.  Also missing, for the most part, are the humorous asides that protagonist Rudy Baylor made in that novel. Instead, the reader is privy to a dull monlogue of 9 years in Willie Traynor's life.<br />  Fortunately, Willie leads an interesting enough life for me to reccomend the book...he purchases a small-town newspaper in the town of Clanton, Mississipi (which contrary to the advertisements for the novel has been visited since a Time to Kill in &quot;THe Chamber&quot; and &quot;The Summons) and the book revolves around his newspaper, a murder trial in the town, and his relationship with an elderly black woman.<br />  Again, there is nothing groundbreaking here, but if you need some quick entertainment, pick it up.  It's loads better than &quot;The Summons&quot; or &quot;The Partner&quot;...but if you can, borrow it from a friend or wait for paperback, it's short and not good enough to merit seventeen dollars.	2004-06-07

It is a sorry state of affairs indeed when the best portion of a Science-Fiction novel is the part that is almost completely grounded in reality.  Such was the case in Orson Scott Card's Ender's Shadow, a parallel novel to Ender's Game.  The first fifty pages describe the rival criminal gangs in the ghettos of Rotterdam, and they sadly represent the pinnacle of the novel.  After that...everything begins to tumble.<br />Ender's Shadow follows the life of &quot;Bean,&quot; (his name is revealed in the latter part of the novel but it's fairly irrelevant) an extremely intelligent young child who, as the book opens, is on the brink of starvation in the streets of Rotterdam.  He cunningly manipulates people to feed himself, and eventually gets out of the ghetto.  Through the help of a nun, Sister Carlotta, he goes to Battle School (an orbital in the sky devised to train children to be officers in the 3rd Alien-Human War) and then the plot adapts to Ender's Game, Card's superior, albeit flawed 1977 entry.<br />Although &quot;Shadow&quot; was far from boring, and I would certainly reccomend it to someone on a long plane or train ride, it is too flawed to trully reccomend as a good book.  For one thing, the main character is not a likeable character, and spending 400 pages with him is not an enviable sitation: he is a sullen loner bent on success, and he quickly grows irratating.  Secondly, the subplot on Earth of Sister Carlotta attempting to see if Bean was a clone or a victim of genetic adaptation is irrelevant and brings the narrative to a screeching halt.  The conclusion, although better than Card's attempt at profound philosophy evidenced in &quot;Game,&quot; still leaves much to be desired.<br />Card's biggest acheivement in &quot;Shadow&quot; is acheving the rare paradox of managing to alienate both people who read his other works and those who havent.  He gives too little backround information on Battle School and all the peripheral settings for the novice to be entertained, and does not show much of Battle School that one who has read &quot;Game&quot; does not alrady know, so someone who was looking for more will not get what he or she wished.<br />I would not reccomend to book to anyone aside from someone who needs easy entertainment...novices will likely be confused and Ender's Game fans will be dissapointed.rtained, and does not show much of Battle School that one who has read &quot;Game&quot; does not alrady know, so someone who was looking for more will not get what he or she wished.<br />I would not reccomend to book to anyone aside from someone who needs easy entertainment...novices will likely be confused and Ender's Game fans will be dissapointed.	2004-04-16

It seems incongruous that a book entitled &quot;Good In Bed&quot; would be little more than a fairy tale, nonetheless, it is so- and if you don't realize after reading fifty pages that this is going to end happily ever after then you're probably not terribly well versed in this type of literature.<br />Candace &quot;Cannie&quot; Shapiro is a fairly ordinary person with ordinary problems, most of which stem to the fact that she's overweight.  Then her pot-smoking ex-boyfriend Bruce starts to write a column entitled &quot;Good in Bed&quot; in a popular women's magazine that gives details about her relationship and insults her weight, or so she thinks.  But fear not, aside from some contrived circumstances near the end of the novel and the memory of her dissapointing father, this is as bad as things get for Cannie...its a fairy tale, and even Cinderella had to suffer in the begginning.  Soon Cannie is on top of the world, because, gosh, she meets a celebrity and they just hit it off and become best pals.  Then the celebrated actress (Maxie...yes you read me correctly, Maxie) takes her to Hollywood, she meets more celebrities (one of whom gives her his car in gratitude for driving him home, which I'm sure happens all the time), the screenplay she wrote way back when she had no celebrity friends and no one would read is revealed to be fantasic, and she makes oodles of money.<br />If you liked what you just read and feel that this makes for an intelligent and well-written book, than by all means buy the book...just don't email me about it, because this is one of the worst books I have read.  Although not boring (its one attribute), it is built around extremly unlikely cirumstances and scenarios and uses contrivance as an element as other authors use characterization and plot.  Do yourself a favor and let this one be, read Watership Down instead.	2004-04-16
US	35394576	RXPXQCG95QCMB	0812550706	401439625	Ender's Game (The Ender Quintet)	Books	3	5	12	N	N	The proverbial &quot;page-turner,&quot; but could have been more.	3 stars is the lowest rating I have ever assigned, and although admittedly I have only written 11 reviews, I still feel guilty. Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, was engaging and more than adequate as science-fiction fodder...and although I'm sure there are some obtuse reviewers here who wrote something along the lines of &quot;if you didn't see the ending coming you're a moron!&quot; I concede that I did not see the ending coming, although I felt I should have guessed it.<br />In any case, the novel Ender's Game focuses around Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggin, an extremely precocious child who is sent to Battle School alongside other bright children. The setting of the book is the future, as with so many sci-fi novels, and aliens known as &quot;Buggers&quot; for their insectoid features (This would later be changed by Card in one of his later novels to &quot;Formic,&quot; a more intelligent, less juvenile name...but that is neither here nor there) have invaded Earth twice. The second invasion was barely stopped, and the Battle School is now being utilized to train new commanders for the next encounter.<br />Battle School revolves around a game which essentially translates to zero-gravity laser tag, although far more complex. The teachers and staff use the battle room to gauge the pupils' leadership ability and command skills- here Ender finds his calling. Despite being small and initially ridiculed, Ender works his way to the top.....but Battle School is just the beginning.<br />This book did not make me want to hole up in my room and read it all in one day, but it certainly was an engaging story...however, it is certainly not without flaws. For one, Ender is not terribly likeable, and also some of his actions in the novel are understandable, they merely serve to make us like Ender less. Moreover, Card juxtaposes Ender's story with the story of his sister and brother on earth, manipulating people on the home planet to go to war with Russia. Not only is the cold-war paranoia (in 1979) misplaced and ill-addressed in a book concerning mankind's battle with aliens, but the scenes are poorly paced and bring the narrative to a halt. The reader craves more time in the battle room with Ender. Lastly (ironically enough) the ending is absolutely abysmal, the only thing worthy of praise being that Card somehow, someway manages to go from a Deus Ex Machina to a feel-good ending to a Deus Ex Machina to a sappy, ham-handed attempt at social commentary. He should be commended for pulling off such a bile-inducing conclusion.<br />Despite my complaints, I still recommend this book...although more for a long plane ride then for an evening at home.ranoia (in 1979) misplaced and ill-addressed in a book concerning mankind's battle with aliens, but the scenes are poorly paced and bring the narrative to a halt.

IT employs almost all types of humor, from subtletly to slapstick, from highbrow to lowbrow.  However, nothing they write has even come close to the hilarity that Our Dumb Century brings to the reader. The book analyses the 20th Century from a not-quite-so objective standpoint, lampooning popular culture, spawning ludicrous conspiracy theories, (&quot;Kennedy Slain by CIA, Mafia, Castro, LBJ, Teamsters, Freemasons)and reveling in the stupidity of our country and the world in the 20th Century. Every page brings something funny and satirical, from &quot;World's Largest Metaphor Hits Ice-Berg - 1912&quot; to &quot;President Confronts Depression with 'Big Deal' Plan: 'Big deal, I'm Rich!' Roosevelt Says - 1933&quot; to &quot;Reagan May Have been Elected, Doesn't Recall - 1981.&quot;<br />Although I am a history buff, anyone with an elemantary backround in American and World History will be highly amused by this brilliant piece of humor, although I found that as I learned more the book became funnier and funnier.  Please, whether you appreciate the lighter side of history or your team just lost and you need something to cheer you up- read Our Dumb Century.	2004-04-14

US	35394576	R1WFS6YTUVW9ET	0380002930	498635851	Watership Down	Books	5	1	1	N	N	An unmitigated masterpiece	It was Sunday night, I needed to pick an Outside Reading Book for English class the next morning.  On my shelf I spotted Watership Down, a book I never was interested in reading.  Nonetheless, I chose it out of neccesity, and computed that to get through the tedium I expected it to be, I would have to read 3 chapters a night.  I sat down and began to read...but there was no chance I was going to stop reading after 3 chapters.  It ensnared me with its depictions of a world we miss, depictions that author Richard Adams illustrates in vibrant detail.  I ended up finishing &quot;the bunny book&quot;, as my friends dubbed it, in less than 3 days.<br />All one needs to know about the plot is that one of the characters, Fiver, has a premonition:  death and destruction is coming to the warren in which they live, and they must flee or die.  Fiver's brother Hazel beleives him, and attempts to convince as many rabbits as they can to leave the warren and save their lives.  The vagabonds set out, at the mercy of the overwhelming number of enemies rabbits have, not to mention the cruelty of their own kind.....they set out to find a home, and what a glorious adventure it is.<br />This book is wonderful on so many levels.  It vividly creates characters until the reader feels that he or she can not only understand them, but relate to them and their problems.  It not only creates a language for these characters, these rabbits, seemlessly integrated through expository footnotes and a dictionary in the back, but an entire culture as well.  The reader learns of the complex rabbit hierarchy, from the despot Chief Rabbits who have their food brought underground to them to the outskirters, &quot;all too accustomed to getting the short end of the stick.&quot;  We learn of the rabbit's God and Underworld, their folk heroes and their legends.  The book is also a political allegory: when one analyses the different warrens, paralells can be seen with Fascism, communism, and other political systems. Adams also puts an applicable quote before each chapter, alluding to past works such as Julius Caesar and Greek Mythology.  The quotes are always pertinent and ascertaining how they pertain to the chapter is enjoyable.  But on top of all that, this book is an adventure story of the highest order, a truely enthralling piece of literature that is truly the only book that I can say, &quot;I laughed, I cheered, I cried&quot; about.  Im not much of a crying man, but Adams' characters are so well drawn it is impossible not to become attached to them.<br />Please, all of you, do yourself a favor and read Watership Down.tems.

This book, although not 1984, is far more profund than anything with Arnold Schwarzenegger in it.<br />Ben Richards, the lead character in The Running Man, is accurately described by one character as an anachronism- he beleives in fidelity and virtue in a bleak dystopian world obsessed with 3D Perverto Mags and watching their fellow man killed on the &quot;Free-Vee&quot;.  However, he is poor and his daughter is ill...the paltry unemployment check must be used for food and he does not wish to see his wife reverting to prostituion.  He turns to the Games, barbaric exploits of human suffering to appease the masses, and is chosen for the most prestigious, dangerous, and rewarding game- The Running Man.<br />In The Running Man the one doing the running must elude the Hunters for 30 days, using the whole world as his arena.  However, the running man must send two videotapes per day back to the Network- enabling the Hunters to pinpoint his location.  Nonetheless, Richards is resourceful and skilled at dissapearing into the bowels of large cities- he has nothing to lose except his life, and knows that the money he makes will reach his wife regardless of whether he lives or dies.<br />I couldn't put this book down, but upon finishing it, (incidentally the ending hits a perfect note for a dystopian novel) I realized there was more to the book than &quot;met the eye&quot;, if you pardon the cliche.  Stephen King (although this book was writen under the psuedonym of Richard Bachman) includes enough social commentary -be it concerning class division, pollution or the television's ability to put blinders on one's eyes- to entice someone looking for more than just an exilarating action novel.<br />Highly reccomended, but avoid the movie like the plague.	2003-11-16

I, however, although a student and \\"forced\\" to read this book, beleive this novel, by John Steinbeck, to be a true classic of American literature.  There are many other reviews below that give a far more indepth plot summary, so I will keep that portion of the reveiw succinct.  The Joad family, suffering from the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression, strap as many of their possesions as they can to their car and head west to the purported paradise of California.  However, they find their paradise to be little more than a dystopia, run by the few plutocrats who have managed to stay afloat in the depression by standing on the shoulders of those below them.  Steinbeck is nothing short of a master here, splicing \\"intercalaries\\" of heartbreaking human suffering into the Joad's comparable tale of woe and misery.  This juxtaposition shows the extent of which the poverty and despair has blighted half a nation of farmers.<br />Anyone who wishes to truly understand the human condition, its depths and its misery, should read this book.  However, it should be noted that anyone looking for an uplifting tale of human tenacity should perhaps look elsewhere, for this novel is unrelenting in its depiction of destruction and despair.<br /><br />If I could give it 10 stars I would	2003-11-05

Dissatifed with America and convinced a war will occur, he buys a village and uses his intelligence to build many things to make the natives' lives easier.  A manipulative man, Allie is able to convince his family (who consider him as nothing short of a God) and the villagers to go along with him.  However, he is human, and has negative qualities which continue to plague him.  He keeps on trying to create a perfect world while the protagonist, his son Charlie, attempts to overlook his father's increasing failures which lead the Fox family towards unimaginable despair.

It follows the life of Winston Smith, who edits history to serve \\"the Party\\" and its needs. THe Party controls every aspect in peoples' lives, watching and listening as much as possible. Nonetheless, Winston begins a love affair with a co-worker, knowing only too well the ramifications of doing so. 1984 also provides some interesting insights about how weak memory when compared to facts, or what everybosy says are facts.

With his brother and everyone they can get to come, they trek across the english countryside looking for a new home, encountering many problems and trouble along the way.  Some have called it a political allegory, and although the author Richard Adams has denied this, allusions can definetly be made to fascism and communism.
