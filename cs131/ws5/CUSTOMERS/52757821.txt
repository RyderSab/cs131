Cutler falls considerably short of THE ART OF HAPPINESS, the original work by the same authors.  In the original book The Dalai Lama provides very interesting views that can be applied to a variety scenarios in life, including the workplace.  <br />Hence, ...HAPPINESS AT WORK is very repetitive of the original and runs the risk of placing someone as illustrious as The Dalai Lama in the position of appearing too much like other marketing-driven authors of the genre who pump out repeats of their original works under other titles like ...FOR THE WORKING SOUL, ...FOR THE GOLFING SOUL, OF HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL FAMILIES, ...OF HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL TEENAGERS, etc.<br />After all, if you read the first book by The Dalai Lama you can easily see how his philosophies concerning happiness apply to all walks of life.  Stick with THE ART OF HAPPINESS and discover for yourself how it may apply to a variety of your questions regarding your personal happiness...including in the workplace.<br />Douglas McAllister	2004-02-05

Good literature was never about strict adherence to historical or physical fact.  We usually call those history or science, respectively.  <br />No, in this book L'Amour seems to let his confident writing skills and his imagination run free.  He asks the reader to imagine what would happen if a frontier-trained lad, Hardy Collins, was forced to make his way cross country with nothing more than a three-year-old girl, Betty Sue Powell, a wonderful, almost magical horse, Big Red and a head filled with the knowledge gained from working side-by-side with a loving but tough western father, Scott Collins.<br />Together, Hardy, Betty Sue and Big Red brave everything from the weather to a grizzly to scummy horse thieves, all the while being tracked by a Cheyenne brave who wants this horse of horses. The story flows extremely well culminating in a classic L'Amour showdown.  <br />A great western for the entire family.  <br />And if you ever get a chance to see the movie of the same title you'll love it too.  It's about as faithful an adaptation to an original book as I have ever seen.<br />Douglas McAllister	2004-01-27

On my seventh birthday I returned home from school and was told that President John F. Kennedy had been assassinated in Dallas earlier in the day.  I didn't fathom at the time the full weight that this event would have and, even more to the point, the contentious argument that it would spawn.<br />Forty years later, having been &quot;joined-at-the-hip&quot; with this event and having studied the matter very carefully over that period of time, I can say unequivocally that indeed the case is closed, just as the title of Gerald Posner's book recommends.<br />Certainly those who are advocates of the mythical conspiracies, any one of them, will claim fabrication and lies.  They have a story and a hobby to lose.  But why would so many intelligent, credible people buy off on Posner's views if the evidence he presents were not conclusive and, accordingly, the case was not indeed closed?<br />And who has bought off on it?  Peter Jennings for one.  If you can't buy Posner's line then find a copy of Peter Jennings masterful report that aired on ABC the week of the fortieth anniversary of that tragic day in Dallas. Like Posner's book, the Jennings report is calm, levelheaded and clear in its presentation of facts about the assassination.  Simple logic becomes, in the end, the most powerful evidence of all in finally closing this case.  Posner (as well as Jennings) addresses every possible question about this case--every question from which each conspiracy was spawned--and answers them in ways that leave no doubt.<br />Any thinking, open-minded person will come away from Posner's book convinced and relieved that this one can at last be put to bed.  No conspiracy.  Case closed!<br />Douglas McAllister	2004-01-09

Kennedy had been assassinated earlier in the day in Dallas, Texas.  Even for a seven-year-old schoolboy the gravity of event was striking. <br />For the next forty years, because of my own curiosity and because the event was continually thrust upon me by the media, I studied the sad event from every possible angle.  I considered the views of those propounding the prospect of the lone shooter, the single bullet.  I listened to the views of those sure that a conspiracy of monumental proportions had taken the President.  In short, I have heard every possible explanation and still the evidence--in my view--leads backs to the beginning.<br />In &quot;The Death of a President,&quot; William Manchester, one of the greatest authors of our time and one renowned for his concise, almost obsessive, research was called upon by Jacqueline Kennedy to attempt to set the record straight.  The work was published in 1967, four years after the assassination. His research was characteristically pointed, considering every detail, every venue, every person involved.  The result: the only book needed to understand the &quot;crime of the century.&quot;<br />In 1988 the book was reprinted and Manchester wrote a new forward to his masterpiece.  He mentions how individuals came to him wondering whether he would update and modify his original work due to &quot;new developments&quot; in chronicling the story.  He observed at the time that, in his view, &quot;the cruel fact&quot; was that there were no new developments.  <br />Having studied, as I said, the event in considerable detail, I echo Manchester's profound sentiment.  There simply is nothing that holds up under severe scrutiny.<br />Conspiracy theorists claim that it is just impossible that someone like Oswald, a crazy loner, could kill someone like Kennedy as the result of the shallowest of motives.  They want to believe that something weightier, darker and more sinister than simple hatred and ego had to be at the root of things.  Why?<br />I would ask them to step back just a few years to when Reagan was President.  Consider a lone gunman, John Hinckley, who squeezes off at least three shots before being subdued, wounding Reagan, Brady and a secret service agent in the process.  His motive?  He wanted to get the attention of a girl, of the actress, Jodie Foster.  The shallowest of motives, nothing more. So why is it that we can accept Hinckley's dementia without crying conspiracy but have such difficulty when it comes to Oswald?  Quite simply Reagan survived.  I believe that, had Reagan died, the nation would have erupted into the same conspiracy craze that has gripped our minds since 1963.<br />&quot;The Death of a President,&quot; so well researched, so well written, is and should be the first and last word.

Maguire's book about an author trying to...well that's just it--I never really discovered what she was really trying to do: find her cousin? find lost cats? find herself? find a friend? find a bistro? find a phone?<br />Maguire scores a couple of stars for some remarkable wordsmithing but then the wordsmithing gets so involved in some spots that one cannot tell whether this is really a book that the author wants others to read or a self-absorbed word game with himself that he hopes will leave all takers, but himself, in the dust.<br />And what's all this about Scrooge?  Yes there is some word play with the epic miser's name and a possible link to the heroine's family name.  Is that it?  Apparently so.

While the Disney interpretation is fun and enchanting, it makes a dramatic departure from the actual stories and takes considerable creative license in telling just a part of the Kipling stories.  Even what we get from Disney falls considerably short of the applicable parts of Kipling's original that Disney used. What? Kaa, the snake, as Mowgli's friend and powerful ally?  What?  A deeper story of Mowgli's experience as a wolf and his relationships with Mother wolf and Father wolf?  Oh yes, much, much more.<br />Kipling's original masterpiece also includes several other wonderful chapters about the continuing adventures of Mowgli and also adds the marvelous tale of \\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi,\\" the heroic mongoose whose battles with wicked cobras in an Indian garden easily matches Mowgli's showdowns with Shere Khan.<br />The book also includes the tale of \\"The White Seal.\\"  This short chapter of \\"The Jungle Book(s)\\" provides a wonderful commentary, in the form of animal parable, on human society, competition, male ego and human pride. Our hero, Kotick, the white seal, through his fearless explorations and his willingness to fight for a dream, changes the minds of his parents, his peers and his society for the better.  The invitation to each of us is very clear to find and free the white seal that exists in all of us.<br />Don't get balled up in the notion that \\"The Jungle Book\\" is just for kids.  A look beneath Kipling's wonderful prose reveals, like most great children's classics, that the author is using the unintimidating forum of children's literature to speak to kids of all ages with the hope that somehow we'll all finally get it.<br />Buy the book, read it, read it to the kids you know and learn the lesson.<br />Douglas McAllister	2003-11-16

After all, if taken at face value, McMurtry's stories sometimes seem to be dominated by earthy, carnal themes and the trashy characters involved in them.  <br />My response to such queries is simple. As with all good literary works, I believe that one needs to look beyond McMurtry's stories and characters to the foundational dynamics that are there. <br />\\"By Sorrow's River\\" invites the thoughtful reader to do just that.  Yes there is the willful,[...]Tasmin, along with the rest of the Berrybender entourage, but there is also the innocent, constant, strong and noble Jim Snow, who, despite Tasmin's best efforts, remains his own person, living by his own creed and is never pulled down to her level. McMurtry's juxtaposition of the tawdry and the timeless explores that which is fleeting and that which is firm.  Inevitably the firm and constant wins out and, like the meeting of frontier flint and steel, sparks fly.  The warmth generated by such meetings is compelling and brings me back to McMurtry's work again and again and again.<br />\\"By Sorrow's River\\", along with \\"Sin Killer\\" and \\"The Wandering Hill\\", taken at face value by western \\"purists\\" (or perhaps \\"delusionists\\" might be a better description--and there is certainly nothing wrong with the delusion of the west) are likely very frustrating. But when read like all other great literature--panning through the slime and silt in search of the nuggets that are invariably there--the results can be extremely rewarding and yes, I believe that \\"By Sorrow's River has gold there in abundance.<br />Those interested in western stories for the sake of western stories, in the stereotypical west where everything falls into its proper and probable place, should stick with Louis L'Amour.  Nothing against L'Amour, mind you.  Let's just see, accept and appreciate the differences.<br />Douglas McAllister	2003-11-07

All have seen a multiplicity of images, the stereotypic Pony Express horse and rider, that grace a variety of corporate stationery, restaurant menus and billboards.  But who really knows the truth of the history of this singularly American venture?  <br />Living in Pony Express country and having done my share of reading and having visited various Express-related sites I thought I was fairly well versed.  But after reading &quot;Orphans Preferred: The Twisted Truth and Lasting Legend of the Pony Express&quot; by Christopher Corbett I have to admit that my supposed knowledge was more a collection of the myth surrounding this short-lived, though spectacular, chapter in history.<br />&quot;Orphans Preferred...&quot; was thoroughly enjoyable read.  Corbett does what all responsible authors tackling a dubious subject should do: he collects all of the information, both factual and fabricated, puts it in the hopper and does his best to sort things through.  Then he leaves it to us, his readers, to maker our own conclusions.  Not once in the book does Mr. Corbett claim to be totally convinced that this or that piece of information is undeniably true or undeniably false.  He correctly leaves it to various quoted sources to do that.<br />But what else could he do?  The information available about the Pony Express is at best a jumbled mess.  Such notables as Buffalo Bill Cody and James Butler &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Hickok muddied the waters with their efforts to link themselves to and take credit for various aspects of the Express.  Hollywood, playing on this hearsay and extensive legend, did its best as well to further mess things up.  The result: not one of us, including Author Corbett (and that made very clear by his own admission in the book), has a clear picture of what really went on.<br />But who's really counting?  Corbett does a masterfuljob of setting straight, at least in my mind, what is absolute fact and what is absolute fiction, leaving a considerable amount of gray area in between.  <br />Corbett eloquently points out in &quot;Orphans Preferred...&quot; that the legend will ride on regardless.  Thank goodness it does.  Legends are great so long as we know they are legends.  But as Americans would we really let any of our favorite legends go, among which the Pony Express holds an honored place, without a considerable fight? <br />John Ford's movie, &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot; perhaps says it best: &quot;This is the west, sir.  When the legend becomes fact, print the legend!&quot;<br />Douglas McAllister	2003-11-05

To Native Americans he was a spirit messenger, sacred to their very existence.  To them and frontiersmen alike the thundering, shaggy beasts represented food, clothing, shelter and fuel.  And in a larger sense the massive herds represented the spirit of freedom in a new and untouched land.<br />In They Came from the Bronx, Neil Waldman recounts the fascinating tale of how this quintessential American animal was brought back from extinction. <br /> Waldman speaks of the Bronx Zoo's \\"Mother Herd,\\" and his curiosity as a child with the name.  How could a captive herd of bison in the largest American metropolis, so far from the wide-open spaces of the Great Plains, claim such a title?  <br />Waldman's story weaves an eloquent account beginning in Oklahoma, stepping back to New York City in the early Nineteen hundreds, offers historical facts about the bison's prairie reign and then it's back to Oklahoma where a Comanche grandmother and her grandson await a most improbable reunion.<br />They Came from the Bronx is technically a children's book but will appeal to children of all ages, from one to ninety-three, if you will.  Beautifully illustrated and written, the book speaks volumes about the tragedy of man's irresponsible exploitation of wildlife but also offers a ray of hope that once mistakes are made and recognized, if we are careful and responsible, they can and should be rectified.<br />Douglas McAllister	2003-10-31

Michener endeared himself to readers everywhere with books like Hawaii, Tales of the South Pacific, Centennial, and Chesapeake.  His writing style and concise, comprehensive research was at the foundation of books that have become American treasures.<br />In This Noble Land Michener takes a different approach, though one not entirely unexpected from an author who, it is evident, loved America deeply. The book takes a hard but, I feel, honest view of America, where it has been, what it is now (the view of things in 1999) and where Michener believes it is headed.<br />Michener addresses the political problems facing us and what it will take, in his view, for Americans to continue their past record of greatness.  He speaks of morals, of ethics and of integrity--from the standpoint of what we were as a country to the backsliding nation that we have become.<br />In my favorite chapter of the book Michener tackles very eloquently the problem of America's love affair with professional sports, the unfortunate decline of the morals of many sports figures, their poor example to America's youth and the sorry fact that we would, as a nation, gladly pay top dollar for tickets to any sporting event while refusing to acknowledge the plight of America's poor.<br />Taken all in all, whether you like This Noble Land or not will depend entirely upon how closely your views agree with those of the author.  For me, I felt that Michener's vision as expounded in This Noble Land was 20/20.  The book is already four years old at this review but I feel that it will have merit for decades to come.  Hopefully we will have the sense as Americans to change things for the better.<br />Douglas McAllister	2003-10-30

I wanted to read the interviews that Krakauer had had with Lafferty and to get a better understanding as to how such heinous crimes could be perpetrated against members of the Lafferty family--Dan's own extended family-- in the name of religion. The book was informative from that standpoint.<br />But if you think that this book will give you the supposed inside story of a possible dark side of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) you are sadly mistaken.<br />Krakauer's approach to this book goes markedly against the grain of responsible journalism.  Are their two sides to this story?  Absolutely!  But Krakauer is careful to tell only a limited, one-sided version that is totally misleading.  Had Krakauer been fair enough to give both sides of the account I would be writing a very different review.  Instead what you have is a hard cover tabloid. <br />In the first place, none of the fundamentalists interviewed by Krakauer are members of the LDS Church. Since the late 1800's all individuals practicing polygamy and, more importantly, given to views and teachings that are inflammatory and contrary to those accepted by the LDS Church are summarily excommunicated. Moreover, Dan Lafferty--even in the Krakauer interviews--admits that he is not a member of the LDS Church and that his beliefs depart dramatically from anything the LDS Church teaches.<br />In the second place, Krakauer's supposed research is extremely limited and riddled with references to the works of individuals like Fawn Brodie--an self avowed nonobjective enemy of the LDS faith who wasted her life away writing unbelievable drivel about the LDS Church's origins. Mind you, she didn't stop with unsupportable rubbish about Mormonism. She also wrote a &quot;landmark&quot; series of books about America's Founding Fathers that painted them as nothing more than a lecherous bunch of womanizers who just got lucky when it came to democracy. Those familiar with Brodie's writings recognize that her reverse chauvinism is as transparent as water and the chip on her shoulder all too evident.<br />If you are sincerely and fairly interested in historic facts regarding The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints read Leonard Arrington's excellent biography of Brigham Young, American Moses. It provides a fair narrative of many of the events included in Krakauer's book--information terribly twisted and misrepresented, I might add.<br />If you want to read this book in order to look at radical religious fundamentalism, especially the tragic events centering on Dan Lafferty and his brother, Ron, then do so. But take Krakauer's supposed &quot;facts&quot; about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-days Saints as what they are--nothing more than mean-spirited, small-minded hearsay. <br />Douglas McAllister	2003-10-13

I am sure that he would want it that way.  More than a politician, Franklin's interests ranged just about as far as his imagination would allow ranging from science to inventions to diplomacy to agriculture to publishing.  Nothing seemed to escape his eye or his intellect.<br />In Benjamin Franklin: An American Live author Walter Isaacson offers the sort of multifaceted look at Franklin that is most fitting.  Isaacson describes a life that aptly takes it place among our nation's greatest individuals.  If George Washington is, appropriately, our preeminent Founding Father then perhaps Franklin rightly assumes the role of Founding Grandfather who, as most grandfathers do, &quot;winks at us&quot; and invites us to not take ourselves too seriously, to not be afraid to ask appropriate questions and to believe in ourselves both as individuals and collectively as Americans.  Most importantly, with nothing else to prove to himself, Franklin's role as described by Isaacson seems to be that of a benevolent overseer, watching the activities of a group of ambitious children and stepping in only when they needed more experienced guidance.<br />Isaacson's book is a must read describing Franklin's humble beginnings to his loftiest achievements. Whether it's flying a kite in a thunderstorm, inventing bifocals and stoves, or mentoring men who would become the first governmental leaders of America, Isaacson's Franklin provides a new perspective of an American icon.<br />Douglas McAllister	2003-10-09

It was interesting to get the skinny straight from the horse's mouth.<br />Much has been said about this book and whether Mr. Spence has taken liberties with writing about the case in question.  In the long run I believe that any report of factual occurrences boils down, in the end to perspective.  As I listened to Spence discuss his perspective I concluded that he has provided an honest representation of the facts in this case according to his own perspective.  What more can be asked of an author?<br />More than a recap of a specific trial, The Smoking Gun is a fascinating account of how one of the nation's greatest attorneys approaches the trial for crime and offers the reader a chance to go inside the Spence legal intellect. Spence, famous for his devotion to the right of everyone to counsel, does what he does best, taking on the big guns of state government and big business in an effort to see that justice is served despite the prosecution's efforts to ensure that state and business personnel come out smelling like roses--even at the expense of possibly railroading innocent people.<br />Spence is an excellent writer and narrator and The Smoking Gun is a compelling read regardless of whether you agree with Spence or not.<br />Douglas McAllister	2003-10-02

Gerry Spence, known mostly for his hard-edged, frontier approaches to some of the most famous court cases of our time, proves that he can write excellent fiction as well.<br />Half-Moon and Empty Stars was well written, entertaining and provocative.  Spence approaches a controversial subject that needs airing.  Not just a western story, Spence's novel addresses the plight of Native Americans and their unwarranted reputation as being lazy, good-for-nothing liars.  <br />Besides, all students of western lore are painfully aware of the fact that it was the white men who had trouble telling the truth and sticking to their promises.  In that vein this book might be an irritating wake up call to any who might believe that Native Americans have gotten what they deserve.<br />As noted in my subject line, the writing is superb and would stand up in favorable comparison to the works of Louis L'Amour, John Grisham and Larry McMurtry.  In Spence's case he seems to bring the best of all three under one cover and Abner Hill, Spence's heroic cowboy lawyer in Half-Moon and Empty Stars, stands up nicely to all comers in any other work of western fiction.<br />I'm waiting for the movie!<br />Douglas McAllister	2003-09-22

I realize that no author, like no actor, wants to be typecast or relegated to the position of having to pursue a single character when hoping to broaden the creative portfolio. But Clancy must realize that readers, especially those who have found a hero, want to continue the story again and again and again. Jack Ryan is such a hero and we haven't grown tired yet.<br />In Teeth of the Tiger Clancy's substitution of our hero with Jack Jr. and his cousins does not come close to repairing damages. <br />The book does offer a well-written story, characteristic of other Clancy non-Jack Ryan novels like Rainbow Six, and may appeal to Clancy first-timers. But it's just not the same for those of us who have come to know Jack Ryan. The characters lack the personality that has become the hallmark of the Jack Ryan stories.

The book paints a fairly accurate picture of all that is involved in getting started, covering the gamut of gadgets and tack necessary, a variety of veterinary issues, housing, feeding, training...you name it.  A good, sound preliminary overview.<br />The one drawback to the book is that the authors go way overboard with trying to help the reader assess whether horse ownership is a realistic option.  It seemed to me that they had perhaps seen some severe situations where people bought horses that really shouldn't have.  As a result they, in some case, uses a sledgehammer to swat the horse fly when a fly swatter would suffice.  If taken too literally the book would drive everyone except die-hard cowboys away from even considering owning horses.  Yes, owning horses is a big responsibility but I have only heard of a few extremely rare cases where horses truly suffered as the result of unprepared owners.<br />However, I see this as a minor thing.  Read the book for the great information that it imparts and don't let the stump speeches about whether you are ready to own a horse by the authors get in the way.	2003-09-11

Specifically the book covers the lives of John Adams, his brilliant son, John Quincy, his grandson, Charles Francis and his great-grandson, Henry.  <br />From the author of the marvelous book, Founding Father, a terrific biography of George Washington, I found First Dynasty to be flat and lacking.  I recently read both McCulloch's biography, John Adams, and Nagel's John Quincy Adams and recommend that all interested students of the Adamses should bypass Brookhiser's volume and stick with the full biographies, both of which offer a complete look at this family that was so essential to the founding and beginnings of America.  <br />A book as brief as Brookhiser's simply cannot and did not do the subject appropriate justice.

Russell: The Life and Legend of America's Cowboy Artist	Books	5	23	25	N	N	&quot;THE&quot; COWBOY ARTIST	Art critics spend much time arguing about the value of western art and as to whether it can really be classified as art at all.  Some of the more snobby critics attempt to discredit western painters by referring to them as &quot;illustrators&quot; as if that changes anything.  They argue that if an artist is commissioned by other than the loftiest of patrons or if their work is used primarily to illuminate a story then their art can only be classified as illustration and not as fine art.  <br />As an art student I argued this one ad nauseam with my art professors.  And invariably the work of Charles Marion Russell, my favorite ARTIST - period - would arise.  But that's enough about small-minded art professors and their unwillingness to accept art wherever they find it.<br />The work of Charles Marion Russell (hereafter CM Russell) is accepted by thousands as arguably the best of the western genre.  It remains the standard against which all other western pieces are judged. Russell also was an accomplished western wit who drew and kept the fast friendship of the king of western wit, Will Rogers.  In his book Charles M. Russell: The Life and Legend of America's Cowboy Artist, John Taliaferro not only discusses the art achievements of Russell but also provides a biography that paints the life of the artist and the west Russell knew so well in the most vivid colors possible.  And indeed CM Russell was the most colorful of characters. <br />Read this book and I'll bet you will at least become the owner of a CM Russell print and at most plan a pilgrimage to Great Falls to visit CM Russell's museum, studio and home.	2003-09-05

When a bad book is written it is difficult to be convincing to anyone about its badness. It boils down to an opinions spitting war. Hopefully that will not happen here.<br />If you are interested in the lives and eccentricities of polygamists, their bizarre behavior and their propensity to violence in defending their beliefs then this book will offer some enlightenment. <br />I read the book specifically to find out more about Dan Lafferty and the murder of his sister-in-law and niece. I wanted to read the interviews that Krakauer had had with Lafferty and to get a better understanding as to how such heinous crimes could be perpetrated against members of the Lafferty family--Dan's own extended family-- in the name of religion. The book was informative from that standpoint.<br />But if you think that this book will give you the supposed inside story of the dark side of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) you are sadly mistaken. <br />In the first place, none of the fundamentalists interviewed by Krakauer are members of the LDS Church. Since the late 1800's all individuals practicing polygamy and, more importantly, given to views and teachings that are inflammatory and contrary to those accepted by the LDS Church are summarily excommunicated. Moreover, Dan Lafferty--even in the Krakauer interviews--admits that he is not a member of the LDS Church and that his beliefs depart dramatically from anything the LDS Church teaches.<br />In the second place, Krakauer's supposed research is riddled with references to the works of individuals like Fawn Brodie--an avowed nonobjective enemy of the LDS faith who wasted her life away writing unbelievable drivel about the Church's origins for decades. Mind you, she didn't stop with insubtantiable rubbish about Mormonism. She also wrote a landmark series of books about America's Founding Fathers that painted them as nothing more than a lecherous bunch of womanizers who just got luckywhen it came to democracy. Brodie's reverse chauvinism is as transparent as water and the chip on her shoulder all too evident.<br />If you are interested in historic facts regarding The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints read Leonard Arrington's excellent biography of Brigham Young, American Moses. It provides a fair narrative of many of the events included in Krakauer's book--information terribly twisted and misrepresented, I might add.<br />If you want to read this book in order to look at radical religious fundamentalism, especially the tragic events centering on Dan Lafferty and his brother, Ron, then do so. But take Krakauer's supposed &quot;facts&quot; about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-days Saints as what they are--nothing more than mean-spirited, small-minded hearsay.	2003-09-05

The March of Folly brings this message back to the forefront and although written in 1984 is as cogent a read as ever.<br />Barbara W. Tuchman eloquently discusses the bizarre propensity of governments throughout history to pursue policies contrary to their own interests. Mind you, this is not a pacifist book but rather one that begs governments to beware of the reckless pursuit of policy that might prove to be dangerous.  And, yes, I admit right readily that hindsight is 20-20.<br />Beginning with the Trojans and their acceptance of the Trojan Horse to benighted Papal policy during the renaissance to Britain's stupidity during the American Revolution to questionable American policy during the Vietnam war, The March of Folly invites the reader to consider the fact that as things change in historic chronology apparently nothing else does.<br />Given our current war policies and efforts in Iraq, The March of Folly is a very poignant read and we must confess, regardless of our political leanings, that the potential for history to repeat itself yet again is considerable.  Who knows, there may yet be a sequel titled The March Continues.	2003-09-05

I actually encountered it on a used book sale rack at my local library.  I picked it up and was stunned to discover that it was an additional installment to the series by Larry McMurtry.  I had bought and read the other three and enthusiastically read this one.<br />Comanche Moon is actually the second book in the series and takes up where Dead Man's Walk leaves off.  <br />Comanche Moon is essential in that it provides much-needed connective tissue between Dead Man's Walk and Lonesome Dove.  It brings Gus and Call back home after their failure in taking Santa Fe.  It also paints much clearer portraits of important characters like Maggie, Newt's mother, and Clara Harris, the love of Augustus McCrae's life.<br />Especially important are the answers to questions that Comanche Moon provides about Blue Duck.  But I'll leave you to the book to discover those for yourself.<br />No less than Lonesome Dove, Dead Man's Walk and Streets of Laredo, Comanche Moon is an incredible story in true Larry McMurtry style and, as already noted, is essential to the complete Lonesome Dove saga.	2003-09-05

I looked and looked but to no avail.  Lincoln biographers were always content with short and glib statements about Lincoln belonging to the ages and dying, appropriately, in small unpretentious rooms.<br />One day I happened to be in a favorite bookstore and, as I often do, I made it a point to peruse the Lincoln titles.  As I glanced at the several titles, all of which were already part of my library, I happened upon Blood on the Moon: The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln by Edward Steers Jr.  To my pleasant surprise here was the book that I had been looking for.  <br />Blood on the Moon, a well written and well-researched volume addresses the assassination in depth and the circumstances and event on both sides of the Mason-Dixon Line leading up to it.  Learn about the military conspiracies that may have contributed to Lincoln's tragic death.  Take in in-depth look into the mind of John Wilkes Booth and see his motives for committing arguably the greatest crime to be committed in the United States.<br />Steers also addresses the issues surrounding Dr. Mudd and his participation in the crime, putting to rest--at least in my mind--the truth about the man whose name has become synonymous with bumbling stupidity.<br />Blood on the Moon is a must for any serious Lincoln scholar and any complete Lincoln library.	2003-09-05

I'd like to say that I sat down and discussed this one with a friend but then you would really know that I was the one with the anxiety problem.  Actually my wife bought this book in order to understand me better but I read it first and found that is was just what the doctor ordered.<br />The book offers some valuable statistics.  For those of us with anxiety it is priceless to know that we are not alone.  Anxiety by nature invites the sufferer to believe that he or she alone is suffering while, in truth there are millions.<br />The book defines the various types of conditions and offers a plethora of applicable solutions including meditation, relaxation, diet and exercise.  Dr. Davidson also discusses medications, whether pharmaceuticals or natural treatments, ways that was easy to understand.  <br />I feel like this book gave me a toolkit to help address my situation and move toward greater strength and confidence.

Unfortunately their game worked for me.  I bought the book and found it to be as dull as ditch water!<br />As I noted in my review of May There Be A Road, don't waste your time on stories and writing that even L'Amour would admit are not his best.

This book is not exclusively for Latter-day Saints and those who avoid it on that basis are really missing philosophies that are sorely needed in our materialistic, selfish world.<br />Nibley cuts right to heart of things when he discusses the need for people (again, not just Mormons) to be content in the simple things of life, to avoid the grinding process of materialism and to find solace in truly reaching out to the poor in society by literally sharing our vast monetary wealth in ways that will truly change the world.<br />NIbley speaks pointedly to those who somehow believe that the new car, big house, oppulent life mentality is the just rewards to professional diligence, giving lip service to appropriate charity but carefully denying the poor the levels of help that they need.  Nibley states very clearly that the materialistic will find his views hard to swallow.<br />Look past the &quot;mormonisms&quot; in this book and find a wealth of ideas that will appeal to anyone who truly wants to take personal steps to implement world-changing philosophies in his or her life.	2003-09-03

I realize that no author, like no actor, wants to be typecast or relegated to the position of having to pursue a single character when hoping to broaden the creative portfolio.

Jack Ryan is such a hero and we haven't grown tired yet.<br />In Teeth of the Tiger Clancy's substitution of our hero with Jack Jr. and his cousins does not come close to repairing damages. <br />The book does offer a well-written story, characteristic of other Clancy non-Jack Ryan novels like Rainbow Six, and may appeal to Clancy first-timers.  But it's just not the same for those of us who have come to know Jack Ryan.  The characters lack the personality that has become the hallmark of the Jack Ryan stories.

Such is the case with the latest installment in the Harry Potter saga from JK Rowling.<br />First, Ms. Rowling seems not to have learned the old school adage that it's not the quantity but the quality that matters. This book is unnecessarily long. It's as though Rowling was told by her marketing strategists that somehow a heftier offering would equate to a heftier credibility.<br />Next the book is dominated by repetitious and trite phrases. My personal favorite is \\"screwed up his eyes...\\" Use it once, okay. Use is several times, over and over again, as Rowling does in Order of the Phoenix and it definitely gets in the way.<br />Finally, Rowling really offers nothing new in this latest volume and we see her straining to keep the tale going. After all, if she is to get Harry out of Hogwarts successfully, she has two volumes to go. If these are as stilted as Order of the Phoenix it may be likely that her readers will have to give it up before they die of boredom.	2003-08-31

Not as good as the Lonesome Dove series (but then, what is?), The Berrybender Narratives are, nonetheless, destined to be western classics.

I've read all of them and while I love McMurtry's writing and the stories presented in Boone's Lick and in volumes 1 and 2 of the new Berry bender series, there is nothing like going back to the source for the real experience.<br />I first read Mountain Man by Vardis Fisher as a teenager.  I read it in conjunction with the release of Jeremiah Johnson upon which the book is loosely based.  At that time I was captured by this genre and have made a regular reading of Mountain Man a part of my program.<br />While I can enthusiastically recommend the newer editions to the Mountain Man genre, I would encourage interested parties in taking a look at Mountain Man first.  While you're at it, rent or buy Jeremiah Johnson starring Robert Redford.  The experience will be one that you don't regret.	2003-08-25

The book covers Cook's humble beginnings as an ordinary seaman, his progress up the ranks of the merchant marine and his unlikely ascension to the rank of captain in the Royal Navy.  The account of his major voyages is a spellbinding narrative that explains clearly that Cook's contribution to world discovery remains unparalleled.<br />An excellent history, Farther Than Any Man tells both sides of the Cook story; his cartographic genius--creating maps and charts that remained the standard well in the twentieth century, his unflinching courage and determination, his boundless vision, and his dominating ego that ultimately led to his untimely death in Hawaii.<br />Farther Than Any Man is a page-turner that you won't be able to put down.  Read it, as I did, prior to a trip to New Zealand and the Cook Islands or, perhaps more realistically, next week to learn more about the world we live in.	2003-08-23

I suppose it was due in part to this reference that I have always been intrigued by this delicacy of delicacies.<br />Caviar, the book, is an enjoyable read that leads the reader through the very interesting history of caviar, the food, from its surprisingly humble origins in Russia to its New World presence and industry.<br />The book also tells the sad plight of the sturgeon, the huge fish from which the finest caviar in the world is harvested, and how this \\"living fossil\\" is now in danger of becoming extinct and that in order to sate the lust that the super rich have, not only for the taste of caviar but for its prestige as well.<br />Interestingly, I found that the sturgeon story has some similarities to the tragedy of the near extinction of the American Bison.  Whereas in all too many cases the buffalo was slaughtered only for its tongue, the sturgeon is taken not so much for its meat which is consumed for food, but for its primary and, comparatively, small contribution in its eggs.<br />A truly fascinating story, read it with a big dish of beluga and crackers or, better yet, save the sturgeon and read it like I did with a coke and some pretzels.  I couldn't have afforded even a small dish of beluga anyway.	2003-08-23

Such is the case with the latest installment in the Harry Potter saga from JK Rowling.<br />First, Ms. Rowling seems not to have learned the old school adage that it's not the quantity but the quality that matters.  This book is unnecessarily long.  It's as though Rowling was told by her marketing strategists that somehow a heftier offering would equate to a heftier credibility.<br />Next the book is dominated by repetitious and trite phrases.  My personal favorite is \\"screwed up his eyes...\\" Use it once, okay.  Use is several times, over and over again, as Rowling does in Order of the Phoenix and it definitely gets in the way.<br />Finally, Rowling really offers nothing new in this latest volume and we see her straining to keep the tale going.  After all, if she is to get Harry out of Hogwarts successfully, she has two volumes to go.  If these are as stilted as Order of the Phoenix it may be likely that her readers will have to give it up before they die of boredom.	2003-08-23

I found the perfect match in John Quincy Adams: A Public Life, a Private Life by Paul C. Nagel.<br />Nagel's portrait aptly introduces the reader to one of America's greatest presidents and, arguably, the greatest and most accomplished member of the renowned Adams family of New England.  Like all great biographies, Nagel's work takes the good with the bad and provides a front on look at the sixth president.<br />While John Quincy's shortcomings are clearly delineated, his strengths, long forgotten in history, come through vividly.  I found myself wondering how America might have forgotten one of its very strongest leaders.  But then I realized that one of John Quincy Adams' greatest strengths was his aversion to the political shenanigans that continue began in his day and continue to this day.  We don't want to remember someone who served as well and with so little scandal.  No, a scene including interns frolicking near the Oval Office with an incumbent president is more our strong suit.<br />If, however, you want to discover how a person can serve for over sixty years with strength and honor you won't be disappointed with Nagel's John Quincy Adams.  You'll also want to view Steven Spielberg's Amistad while you're at it.	2003-08-22

Such seems true with this latest installment of the Harry Potter saga.<br />Not only is the book unnecessarily long (I guess Rowling felt that length would mean greater credibility), it also has all the trappings of an author who is thinking too much about selling books than about the story.  <br />I can hear Rowling now: Let's see, let's put in all sorts of bizarre and tangled foreshadowing, like staircases that, shifting this way and that, ultimately lead nowhere and just for show.  Wonderful, wonderful! And what about a few new characters that are all poorly developed.  Yes, yes, that's it.  Oh, and let's overuse a few favorite phrases like \\"screw up\\" your eyes.  Good, good!  And let's be sure to go to the newspapers and to talkshow interviews and drop hints all over the place that sound more interesting than they really are!<br />I shudder to think of what the final installment of this series will be should this trend of overthought and overmarketing continue in ensuing books in order to see Harry through to graduation from Hogwarts.<br />If you need a fresh Harry Potter fix, read one of the previous four installments or watch one of the movies and let's hope that JK Rowling finds her muse again before proceeding with the story.	2003-08-22

Is Tiger Woods the golfing machine that John Andrisani wants us to believe he is?  Or is he human, at the pinnacle of his game and cruising?  Golf is all about streaks.  Think about Johnny Miller.  At the top of his game everyone was saying that HE was the next Nicklaus.  Then all of a sudden it was as though he had been abducted by aliens.  Go, Tiger, go! But I won't be the least bit surprised when the streak ends and Tiger ends up stumping Mizuno or Maxfli or Golfsmith instead of Nike.<br />Well...maybe.  <br />The book does bring to the table some very good things about the mind game of golf.  Tiger aside, this book could have been just as good without Andrisani's overt Tiger Woods hero worship that literally drips from every page.<br />Go ahead and read it.  Not too bad, really. Not too deep.  Definitely not earth shattering.	2003-03-28

Accordingly I have read nearly everything I could find about the man. <br />I just completed all four volumes of &quot;The Porter Rockwell Chronicles&quot; by Mr. Dewey and found the story well researched and riveting.<br />However, I had to give the series only 3 stars because every one of the books is riddled with more typos and malapropisms than the bullet holes found in the corpses of Porter Rockwell's alleged victims! Mr. Dewey either needs to tune up his act or at least fire his proofreaders.<br />Dewey's writing style also continually strays from Rockwell's period to modern expressions like &quot;freaky,&quot; &quot;stoned out of his mind,&quot; and, my favorite, &quot;Just hypothetically speaking...&quot; It's a well-known fact that Rockwell couldn't read so a scenario with him using words like &quot;hypothetically&quot; was a bit hard to swallow.<br />Still a great story. If you don't mind chewing through the gristle of the terrible writing then go for it. If not, check out Harold Schindler's excellent biography, &quot;Orrin Porter Rockwell: Man of God, Son of Thunder&quot; or Dewey's own excellent biography of Porter Rockwell.	2003-02-20
