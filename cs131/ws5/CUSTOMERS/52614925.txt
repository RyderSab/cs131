This book is a must-read for any fan of EastEnders. Author Kate Lock has true empathy, not only for Grant Mitchell but for all the other characters, and covers an amazing amount of ground. The only thing that was hard to get  used to is that, because of the amount of time spanned, the non-Grant story  lines are often summarized in a few paragraphs (e.g., events like Eddie  Royle's murder and Michelle Fowler's decision to leave Walford). But this  allows Lock to explore Grant, Phil, Sharon, Peggy, Kathy, and Tiffany in  detail. The book also helped explain a few things that took place before I  started watching the series. And because my PBS station in the Washington,  D.C. area is about three years behind England in airing EastEnders, it's  also possible to see where the show will go from here.<br />Now that Ross Kemp  (Grant) has left the show, I hope Lock writes a sequel that ties things up  -- I'd be the first to buy a copy!	2000-06-20

Books	4	48	51	N	N	An excellent intro to Web genealogical resources	The best review I can give of this book is that it directed me to about 6 Web sites I hadn't heard of which should give me a lot of useful information in researching my family tree. Unlike a lot of Dummies books,  this one isn't padded with filler; every page conveys useful information,  discussing numerous internet resources and making suggestions for  organizing research. The book also contains lengthy sections on  African-American, Native American, and Hispanic genealogical Web sites, and  apparently has more information on these sites than many other books.<br />The  reasons I didn't rate the book five stars are two-fold: there are dead  links in addition to the live ones, and the book was published before the  LDS database (maintained by the Mormon Church) was made available online.  That suggests that this book is ripe for a 3rd Edition.	2000-06-20

This one comes the closest; in Paradise Postponed, Mortimer follows a disparate  group of characters from the Second World War up through the late 1960s,  using their stories to reflect developments in England during the same  period. As you might expect from the creator of Rumpole, there's also an  interesting mystery, but the real focus is on the relationships and  dynamics between the characters, as Mortimer centers on a young man from a  working class background who eventually becomes a powerful politician.  Mortimer has an uncanny knack for creating characters who are believable,  quirky individuals, and he makes us care about their struggles. The  dialogue crackles, which one might expect since Mortimer was writing the TV  adaptation of Paradise Postponed at the same time he was writing the novel.  Paradise Postponed has had two sequels, which don't have quite the same  scope either in terms of character development or time period  covered.<br />What surprises me is that the TV adaptation of Paradise  Postponed has never been released on video, at least in the U.S. There'd be  a large market for it.	2000-06-19

I was wrong! This is a superb, comprehensive book that tells  you exactly what to expect, and what is expected of you, at each stage of  the writing and production process.<br />But what I think makes the book stand  out is Smith's detailed explanation of how to lay a foundation for writing  a script, i.e., start by considering the premise, then consider sequences  and scenes, and only then move to dialogue. Smith gives the best  description I've ever read of the reasons for taking this approach. You can  apply these ideas not only to TV comedy, but also to plays, films, and  drama. It's a good explanation of how to create a story premise that  &quot;writes itself.&quot;<br />I intend to continue writing plays, yet I'm  sure I'll refer to this book at length in the future. It's much more useful  than many other writing books I've read.	2000-06-07

This is unlike anything else Williams wrote;  it's nonlinear, overtly symbolic, lacking a conventional plot, and filled  with images that don't make literal sense even as they speak directly to  the subconscious. I think it could be Williams' most brilliant work, but  others will prefer his more accessible plays and I don't dispute that.  &quot;Camino Real&quot; is unusual and will not be for everyone.<br />In the  play Williams deals with end-of-life issues in a very stark way; he also  explores how a person's own fears can keep him or her from moving beyond  the comfort of the familiar into unknown territory. I have to confess: I  read the play after seeing it and being bowled over by the production (at  the Shakespeare Theatre in Washington), and the question may be whether  those who haven't seen it will find it equally powerful just to read it.  This is a case where I think they may; the plays' symbols and images come  alive in the imagination. Even if you don't like it, you'll find it  thoughtful and challenging.	2000-06-05

It's more accurate to say that the book is Millard Kaufman's  memoir of working in the Hollywood studio system, leavened with occasional  generalities about writing. Not that these generalities aren't valuable,  but it takes Kaufman *more than 100 pages* to start talking about the art  of writing. That isn't what you want or expect from an  &quot;instructional&quot; book.<br />Also, anyone with a writing background  will disagree with many of Kaufman's generalities. He says that one should  never ask for a critique of one's work from another writer, because of,  among other things, other writers' jealousy of good work. The *day after* I  read that, I met with a fellow playwright who gave me two hours of  insightful critique on a play I'd just completed. In another place, Kaufman  says, &quot;Readers are only conscious of seeing words on a page when the  narrative is so boring or so confused that you can't picture it.&quot; I  can think of James Baldwin and others as counterexamples.<br />The point is  that when you start questioning Kaufman's generalities, he hasn't presented  enough material about the craft of writing to make you trust the rest of  the book. I can only recommend this book marginally, since some of the  material may be useful if only because it reinforces what you've learned  elsewhere. But this definitely should not be high on someone's list.	2000-05-25

In college in the 1970s, a friend suggested this novel to me, and it was my first exposure to James Baldwin. For the first time in my life, I felt I  was reading about *me*. Baldwin's gift in writing about how people try to  find dignity and self-worth in a world not of their own choosing is  breathtaking and heartfelt. Anyone who has ever felt like an outsider will  feel great empathy with Baldwin's work. In Tell Me How Long the Train's  Been Gone, Baldwin focuses on  the shifting relationships between a small  group of people trying to work out who they are and how they can be true to  themselves in an environment that's often uncaring. Over and over I was  struck by the amount of raw experience Baldwin poured onto each page, and  the amount of pain that must have been behind each sentence. As the years  have gone by, I've also found that you can reread Baldwin at different  stages of your life and see something different each time.<br />Baldwin may be  better known for his essays than his fiction, but I've always found his  fiction more powerful. This novel, and Just Above My Head, are two of the  most beautiful works I've ever read.	2000-05-02

I don't recall any other book that explains in detail,  for example, the strained relations between McGoohan and George Markstein,  or what it was like to work around David Tomblin.

The first 150 pages consist of  descriptions of the etiology and treatment of many different kinds of  cancer. What's impressive here is that the book contains detailed  information but can be understood by the lay reader. The rest of the book  (about 200 pages) discusses such topics as treatment options and side  effects, biological therapy, getting second opinions, alternative  treatment, and getting one's affairs in order.<br />What I appreciate about  this book is that it gives a realistic picture and describes negative as  well as positive effects of various treatments. I feel it gives the cancer  patient a good idea of what to expect, and will be useful as patients move  into different phases of their experience with cancer. So much information  is conveyed here that a second or third reading would be worthwhile. This  is one of the two or three most useful books about cancer I've found thus  far.	2000-04-17

He's like an earthier Paul Theroux, or like Peter Mayle as channeled by  Dave Barry. Bryson is good at using both humor and hyperbole to illustrate  good points about his British travels as well as disappointments. After  reading the book, you feel you've had a conversation with an old friend who  gave you the lowdown on his trip without any sugar-coating. You feel that  everything Bryson says comes directly from the heart.<br />The only reason I  didn't rate the book 5 stars is that, a few times too often, Bryson goes  into great detail about how rude he was toward service people who were just  doing their jobs and whose performance wasn't precisely what he wanted. He  reaches a low point when he takes almost a page to describe his reaction to  a McDonald's employee who made the mistake of asking if he wanted &quot;an  apple turnover with that.&quot; Maybe it's because I've waited tables, but  Bryson struck me as exactly the kind of arrogant, self-righteous,  condescending customer you prayed you wouldn't have to serve. He comes  close in these passages to personifying the ugly American: willing to enjoy  England's riches, but not tolerant of its shortcomings.<br />Nevertheless,  that's no reason not to read the book. Bryson's insights into the places he  visits are more than worth the price of admission.	2000-04-10

I believe one would find the play equally powerful without having seen it. Perhaps  because Margaret Edson never had formal training as a playwright, no one  told her what she &quot;shouldn't&quot; do, and as a result, Wit is a  brilliant, searing, *unique* vision of how a woman's mind becomes sharper  and more insightful even as her body deteriorates. The character of Dr.  Vivian Bearing reminded me a lot of Maria Callas in &quot;Master  Class&quot; (at least, as rendered on stage); both are strong, imperious  characters who draw you into their confidence while challenging you to keep  up. And it's a relief to find a play that doesn't talk down to its  readers/viewers, and actually contains, for instance, a lecture on a Donne  sonnet -- which, incredibly, moves the action forward. After reading or  seeing the play, you feel emotionally drained but energized.<br />I'm both a  cancer patient and a playwright, and I can only hope that I'm able to  produce as eloquent and powerful a work as Margaret Edson has given us.	2000-03-16

The trouble with a book like this, as some of the negative posts unintentionally illustrate, is that experienced writers will have already been exposed to many of these ideas and may erroneously conclude that the book therefore has no value. To the contrary, all it takes is one or two  useful ideas and a book like this pays for itself. Because Lerch breaks her  topics down into easily-digested bits, the tips are basic but practical.  The strength of the book is that Lerch covers every aspect of a screenplay  in terms of character development, plot points, etc. Also I found useful  her description of how to handle rejection and what changes to make in a  screenplay before re-submitting it. News flash to the negative reviewers:  many of her points are almost identical to those in Robert McKee's  oft-touted &quot;Story.&quot;<br />I'm struck by the juvenile condescension  expressed by many of this book's reviewers.

John Mortimer's Rumpole stories are almost too good to be true; they're witty, humorous,  and can be enjoyed as examples of good writing in addition to being  well-plotted mysteries. They're one of the few mystery series which don't  lose enjoyment even after you've seen the film adaptations. My favorite  Rumpoles are probably Rumpole a la Carte and Rumpole on Trial; this  &quot;Best of&quot; compilation features stories, chosen by Mortimer, from  several different eras, including Rumpole's very first appearance. The book  is a good way to get acquainted with Rumpole, and it also makes a great  gift.<br />The only possible downside is that, after reading the Rumpole  stories, you may think that Mortimer's other fiction doesn't *quite*  measure up. Here's hoping he decides to bring back Rumpole!	2000-03-13

This is *by far* the most useful. Various chapters describe how cancer spreads, what  the emotional and physical consequences will be, and what kinds of  therapies are available. The heart of the book is a series of chapters  numbering about 200 pages (!) explaining the symptoms and treatment of  every major type of cancer, and probably most minor types.<br />What makes  this book especially valuable is its clear, direct writing style which uses  layman's terms but is still informative, without being condescending or too  general. The author obviously has had a great deal of experience conveying  medical information to laypeople. His compassion also comes through clearly  and shows his sensitivity to the feelings of the cancer patient and those  around him or her.<br />This is one of the few books about cancer that I will  probably use as a reference and return to again and again.	2000-02-14

That's why I wish I could be more enthusiastic about this book, a  collection of his short stories. Holleran seems to have a fascination with  rather affected characters, like Sutherland in Dancer From The Dance; that  type of character appears in almost every one of these stories, and they  quickly become not only tiresome but interchangeable. You feel you're  reading the same story over and over. Holleran is more effective, I think,  when writing about his interior experiences, as he shows here in the title  story, and his introduction of one bitchy character after another  eventually seems intrusive.<br />Much better writing can be found in  Holleran's underrated Nights in Aruba, and in some passages from The Beauty  of Men (notably those about growing older). I'd recommend those books but  perhaps not this one.	2000-02-10

More clearly than in many other books, Rubie and Provost explore the nature of  character, objectives, and obstacles, and demonstrate that plot and  structure derive from character and conflict. While the book is primarily  intended for writers of fiction and nonfiction narrative, the principles  can also be used by screenwriters and playwrights, and in fact most of the  authors' examples are taken from films.<br />I'm a playwright and read this  book while blocked on a project. Thanks to the ideas expressed here, I was  able to go back and immediately think of further ideas and a &quot;next  step.&quot; The only reason I didn't rate the book 5 stars is that I think  you can quarrel with some specific pieces of advice and with some analyses  (e.g., the authors cite the play and movie &quot;Betrayal&quot; as an  example of flashback, while I think it's actually an example of a nonlinear  time sequence).

I was diagnosed with cancer less than a year ago and just read Arlene Cotter's book recently. At first I wondered how useful it could be, given that many of the book's affirmations have probably already occurred to many  cancer patients. Then I remembered how I felt shortly after being diagnosed  and realized how useful it would have been to have a book like this, filled  with nonjudgemental expressions of support for the choices a cancer patient  makes in living his or her own life.<br />For that reason, I think From This  Moment On may be most useful to those who are newly diagnosed. Also, I  think it would be very valuable for friends and family members of cancer  patients, who often feel more helpless than the patient and could use a  &quot;window&quot; into a cancer patient's feelings.<br />But I think the real  affirmation has nothing to do with what's between the book's covers. Arlene  Cotter was diagnosed with cancer; she then had the idea for this book,  created it, and published it. That may be the ultimate inspiration here.	2000-02-08

In the first part, Tobias interviews several people involved in screenwriting about their roles in the process;  he includes a director, a producer, an agent, two actors, etc. My attitude  toward the book changed while I was reading the interviews; at first I  thought they might give just a cursory overview of the screenwriting world,  but Tobias has asked very detailed questions and his interviewees' comments  always relate directly to what a writer should keep in mind. Also, Tobias  isn't above disagreeing with the interviewees on occasion.<br />Tobias follows  this with a detailed account of what happens to both a script and a writer  at every stage in the film and TV-making process. His account fairly drips  with experience, and you know you're getting the advice of someone who has  been in the trenches. What I liked was Tobias' attitude that it's important  to know just what happens to a writer, but that it shouldn't hold you back.  He's realistic but not discouraging.<br />(Tobias also earned my unending  respect by pointing out that analyzing screenplays in terms of where plot  points and climaxes occur isn't too helpful to someone working on a script,  since the analyses takes place *after the fact* of writing. By saying that,  Tobias encapsulated my objection to many other books about screenwriting,  including Robert McKee's &quot;Story.&quot;)<br />All in all, I think this  will be one of my most helpful books on screenwriting.	2000-01-27

If any one book could be said to distill James Baldwin's entire life, this could be it, at least among his fiction. The sense of love, compassion, and  empathy Baldwin has for his characters is tangible. Many of the passages  are poetic in their power; Baldwin excels at finding the nuance, the  meanings in a gesture, a glance, a touch. Baldwin was a black gay man but I  believe that in this book he has transcended both race and sex, and is  writing about something more basic and yet more complex: relationships  between *human beings*. For those who grew up in the 1960s and 70s, it's  impossible to overstate the impact Baldwin had on many of our lives (even  in my case, and I'm Caucasian).<br />I was lucky enough to hear Baldwin  lecture 20 years ago; Just Above My Head had been out for about a year and  I was able to get my copy autographed and personalized.

I'm a playwright who is interested in branching into teleplays, and  this is the first book I've read that discusses in detail the differences  between teleplays and screenplays. Arguably Keane's book is a bit  formulaic, but he'd probably say that he's just describing the formulas  which the studios are interested in.<br />My only qualm was Keane's inclusion  of *full text* of one of his own unproduced screenplays, complete with  annotations (at one point he says, &quot;WHAT A CLIMAX!&quot;).

Is it really a surprise that a book by Dunne would contain name-dropping? I found this to be a fascinating book which I  couldn't put down. It's refreshing to find someone who's unafraid to  express his candid opinions about the Simpson case without couching them in  legalese or PC rhetoric.<br />As for the unusual ending, it didn't bother me.  If Dunne wanted to make sure the Gus Bailey character would never cover  another murder trial, I can't think of a more original way.	1999-02-22

Like the reader from Detroit, I was puzzled by some aspects of the audio abridgement (notably the conclusion), but unlike that  reader I didn't think it detracted seriously from the flavor of what  remained. I had doubts about whether an introspective writer like Baldwin  could be a candidate for an audio book, but Howard Rollins made the text  come alive. We can only be sorry he didn't record more of Baldwin's books,  for Rollins' voice reveals the depth of his understanding of Baldwin's  characters and emotions. There's a reason a book is considered a classic,  and Rollins makes clear why this book has endured. Perhaps some listeners  will be motivated by this recording to seek out and read Baldwin's other  novels; if so, treasures await them.	1998-11-16

At times, Petrocelli tells you more than you need to know about every member of the prosecution team, and he occasionally overdoes the sports metaphors, but this is more than made up for by his command of the case and his passion for justice. His account of his cross-examination of Simpson is one of the most powerful narrations I've read in a long time. You wish he'd been in charge of the criminal case.<br />I disagree with Amazon.com's decision to let one of the other reviewers use this page to plug his own product. What a surprise that reviewer wasn't satisfied with Petrocelli's book!	1998-07-29
US	52614925	R3COIRM119NPE1	0312019009	713364702	The Mayor of Castro Street: The Life and Times of Harvey Milk (Stonewall Inn Editions)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Superb, poetic, moving	It would be hard to imagine a more sensitive biography of Harvey Milk than this one. Randy Shilts leavens his reportorial writing style with occasional poetic touches that allow the reader to grasp the big picture of how and why tremendous change took place in San Francisco's culture in the 1970s. You read about Milk, but you also read about a city and an era. Read this book and see &quot;The Times of Harvey Milk&quot;; both brought tears to my eyes.	1998-07-24
US	52614925	R49Y7UN7TEXN4	0787105791	888603041	The Private Diary of an O.J. Juror: Behind the Scenes of the Trial of the Century	Books	3	9	10	N	N	Knox's Memoirs a Mixed Bag	Michael Knox's book, while it doesn't contain any earth-shaking revelations, is more thoughtful and less predictable than one might expect. True, he sees the Simpson criminal trial through a racial prism and defines almost everything and everyone in racial terms, and true, his explanations for not letting the court know about his kidnapping charge are far-fetched. But he also has enough sensitivity to report the dynamics of the jury fairly. In fact, since we know he isn't pulling any punches, it's interesting to hear what he thinks of the way the jurors reacted to a lesbian juror, and the way they treated his own family after seeing he has a multiracial group of foster children. There's also an unintended irony in the way Knox concludes his book, since it was written before the criminal trial verdict. Those who disagreed with the first Simpson verdict will be fascinated by this account of what really took place among the jurors.	1998-07-22

This is one of the most enjoyable books I've read about The Avengers. The authors group their comments around individual episodes, but rather than just being an episode guide, the listings contain an index of 'wit,' 'kinkiness,' 'fights,' and 'champagne' (and in the case of The New Avengers, 'fashion victims' and 'porno funk music'). The authors also include behind-the-scenes tidbits about each episode; they obviously love the series but aren't above poking playful fun at it. Warning: this book is addictive. I find it hard to put down.	1998-07-20

After starting and discarding several tendentious &quot;histories&quot; of the House of Windsor, I found this one to be a breath of fresh air. Peter Fearon has written an objective, concisely-written, exhaustive account of the royal family (beginning with the death of Queen Victoria), and yet has done so in a highly readable way. Unlike every other author I've seen so far, Fearon doesn't seem to have an axe to grind about the Windsors. I'm in my 40s and hadn't been exposed to much of the history here and found it fascinating. I was sorry to finish the book.	1998-07-14

You may wonder what this book could offer that isn't found in other books already on the market. To my mind, what makes this book unique are its interviews (with Macnee, Rigg, Thorson, and Brian Clemens) and possibly the best collection of photos gathered in a single source, including everyone from Ian Hendry to Joanna Lumley. Dave Rogers' &quot;The Complete Avengers&quot; tells you more about the series itself, but &quot;The Avengers Companion&quot; has much better photographs. (And in the interviews, Linda Thorson unintentionally sheds light on why then-producer John Bryce cast her as Tara King.) This book captures the spirit of the show and can be recommended.	1998-07-10
US	52614925	R2V82FQS04YITA	0787106879	586962846	Mistrial of the Century: A Private Diary of the Jury System on Trial	Books	3	2	3	N	N	A study of sequestration	Onetime Simpson juror Tracy Kennedy has written an account that, intentionally or otherwise, argues strongly against jury sequestration. Those looking for juicy tidbits about courtroom proceedings during the first Simpson trial won't find them here, and in a way that's the point. Kennedy demonstrates the effects of long-term sequestration, showing that the jurors were not only not informed about most of what was happening in court (those who watched CNN knew more than the jury), but that they also grew increasingly, dangerously isolated from the outside world. Tracy and his wife Judith contribute chapters as Judith recounts her growing concern over Tracy's emotional and physical health. &quot;Mistrial of the Century&quot; could be useful reading for those studying the jury process.	1998-07-06
US	52614925	R2PW0CS1MNRJEL	1559723610	702009226	The Prosecution Responds: An O.J. Simpson Trial Prosecutor Reveals What Really Happened	Books	5	6	8	N	N	The best explanation of the prosecution's tactics I've read	Hank Goldberg was one of the least-known prosecutors in the first Simpson trial, and partly for that reason his book didn't cause much stir. That's a shame, since it reveals much about the prosecution's strategy and mind-set. The book can be read not only as an indictment of Simpson, but also as a fascinating description of preparations for trial. Goldberg has at least as good of a tactical sense as was revealed by Marcia Clark in &quot;Without a Doubt,&quot; and has a much better grasp of the case itself than was shown by Christopher Darden in the overrated &quot;In Contempt.&quot; Goldberg is one of the few players in the Simpson saga that actually seems to enjoy his job; if I were involved in a lawsuit, I'd want him representing me.	1998-06-30
