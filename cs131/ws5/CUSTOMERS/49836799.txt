She expresses anger that her mother became a victim of the government's lack of vigilance in protecting the blood supply in the early and mid-1980s. She blames the FDA for not following the screening procedures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and her account of the minimal knowledge doctors provided her mother and their insensitivity is outrageous.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Nancy's mother insisted that her illness remain a secret. This was a huge burden on Nancy, since she couldn't confide in her friends or tell her own teenage sons. Besides having battled her own muscle disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and taking care of her son who was born with cerebral palsy, she was now caretaker of her own mother. In the final stages, when the virus affected the brain and dementia set in, day-by-day, Nancy watched her mother slowly lose her memory, speech, and ability to walk. But a few months before she died, she asked Nancy to write about her battle with AIDS, so that others wouldn't ever suffer in silence as she had.<br /><br />Nancy is a brave, courageous and compassionate woman who gave her mother endless love and support. She keeps her memory alive through the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt. At the bottom of her mother's panel, she writes, \\"It hurts to know you suffered in silence.\\" A warrior for AIDS education and prevention, Nancy volunteered in Washington, D.C. by participating in a display on the Ellipse where 8,000 new panels were displayed.<br /><br />A Burden of Silence: My Mother's Battle with AIDS, is filled with humorous, fond memories, and I found it inspiring and filled with courage, faith, and deep love between a mother and daughter. She also includes holistic and music therapy recommendations that can be helpful to anyone with dementia or any disease. I encourage you to read this tender love story.<br /><br />-Jacqueline Marcell, Author 'Elder Rage, or Take My Father... Please!

This book helped me so much feel not so alone with the enormous strain I am going thorugh with my parents, who are both starting to have odd behaviors. I just sobbed at all I was going through until I read this book. Now I have some real tools, techniques, understanding, and I know how to get back to compassion when I start to lose it. Take this book with you to a support group, as I found that being around others helped me so much. Another MUST read that will help you cope is &quot;Elder Rage&quot; which is full of practical advice too, delivered with so much humor it is a fun read that you can't put down. Two wonderful books of hope.	2001-08-18

Joy Loverde has put it all at your fingertips. No need to struggle to find out how to manage it all anymore. I am coping with caring for 3 elderly relatives all with various stages of illness and dimentia, and did I ever need this book. I wish someone had told me all this before, it would have saved me so much time and frustration. Why isn't there a TV program for all us caregivers airing weekly with all this information, there are certainly enough of us coping. Until then, read this book, and then for a really enjoyable novel-like read that is packed with care-giving information too, look at &quot;Elder Rage&quot;.	2001-08-17
