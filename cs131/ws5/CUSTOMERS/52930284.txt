I have always been interested in the story of the TCR but so many of the books were daunting and very bulky until now!  Mr. Ambrose is a splendid story teller and gives us the guts of the story.  (He was wrong however when he said in the end that almost no one has heard of Crocker.  Well, come to Southern California because we have heard of him.  We had Crocker Bank in Los Angeles which is a tall orangeish building erected around 1982, and Crocker Tower in Santa Monica.  Crocker Bank is no longer but the name remains in our memories).  The building of this railroad is so incredible and one tries -to imangine this swarm of people building as they walked along for hundreds and hundreds of miles.  The Chinese were superb although I thought the term Chinamen was politically incorrect nowdays, especially when Ambrose is using it for himself and not as a quote from back in them olden days.  The UPs Hell on Wheels was something else, and the Jalsberg story is mind blowing (ha!) to say the least.  I was particularly impressed with CP's Missouri Bill and his team in getting the locamotive to the Sierra summit.  I found myself rooting for the CP and thought Crocker was an ok kind'a guy.  He was out there all the time and even though some of the other leaders were too, he impressed me the most.  Doc Durant was the scum of all scum and the worst of any of them; just a slimy slug all the way.  I found myself reading this late at night until my eyes stung and then dreaming about those men just spiking those rails -- the ringing of their hammers woke me up -- oops, that was the alarm clock.  This was truly an adventure and I'm glad Ambrose didn't waste a lot of paper with boring statistics.	2000-09-29

I  read &quot;Fools Crow&quot; and   &quot;Winter in the Blood&quot; several  years ago and now this.  What a wonderful story of C.E. and how he was left  behind when Buffalo Bill moved on.  This is based on a true story (I even  read about it on the www a year or so ago by accident).  Charging Elk  escapes from a hospital only to find himself in a totally foreign world;  like another planet to him.  All the people he comes in contact with regard  him as an alien or a savage whose soul must be saved. He had dreams and  remembers the old days with fondess and longing.  He falls in love with a  lady of the night with hopes and plans which all to soon are dashed by an  &quot;evilness&quot;.  I don't want to spoil the story for anyone, but if  you want to read a most beautiful story this is the one.  There are some  parts that are shocking to the innocent but you can bet that sort of thing  went on very covertly.  It gets sadder but does it have a happy ending or a  sad one?  You'll have to find out for yourself; you won't be disapointed  either way because it's a great story.	2000-09-08

Even English kids know it  started on April 19 -- you know, the &quot;shot heard 'round the  world&quot;.  I think he dwelt too long on the hidden messages and  backwards record bit.   The stories on Buddy Holly, and Johnny Horton were  good.  I thought JH had died in a plane crash along with Patsy Cline.  I  think more information on Jimi Hendrix and the Doors would've been welcome  as there was so much info on Led Zepplin.  The story of Brian Jones was  about the saddest of all.  What about other rock bands or c/w singers.   Those C/W singers are always having misfortunes.  You gotta wonder why  r&amp;r gets such a bad rap when the music is so good much of the time.   The first part of the book was really good but toward the end I got a  little bored.  Still, I'm amazed how many people dabble in black magic  thinking it's a lark -- well, it's a true power and you'd best be careful  playing with that kind of fire.  Seriously!	2000-08-30

I had just gotten back from a  weary on-the-road forever vacation (HA!) and had been in the Sonoma area  and driven along the coast highway where this story takes place.  Not to  mention the fact I live right near &quot;Pico&quot; Blvd.  This makes the  book more personal and I found myself reading it at night and forgetting  about the 11:00 news.  I found myself rooting for Kearny and Kit and  seething at Stockton and Fremont.  Stokton and Fremont were both puffed up  egomaniacs and the jailing of Vallejo was really unjustified.  The incident  at San Pascual was particularly (sp) chilling and just the sort of thing  that should never occurred in the first place.  Both Stockon and Fremont  were a little put off by the Californio's attitude akin to &quot;Sure,  raise your flag if you want, we're taking our siesta now&quot;.  Mexico did  not come to California's aide even though they had been called upon for  assistance.  You snooze, you lose I guess.  Not much has changed in  attitudes here in sunny California.  We are still independent and don't  take no guff, and we're pretty laid back and easy going.  For anyone who  thinks history is bo-o-oring; read this gem of a story as it can read like  a novel.	2000-08-16

Yes, finally someone has come out and addressed this problem.  The problem really isn't children, it's the adults who want children to mind and  behave.  What sort of nation are we who tell children to &quot;Just Say  No&quot; and then give them ritalin and other drugs -- at 2 and 3!  If my  toddler acted like a vegtable that's supposed to make me happy!   Some war  on drugs this nation is fighting!  And then we wonder why kids go on to  herion and cocaine?  The schools are to blame too because the system is so  rigid and doesn't allow for children to be children but little automated  robots who are rewarded for sitting quitely and raising their hands.   Children need more physical stimulation which involves a learning process.   This sitting still for 6 hours a day is not natural but then again this  nation only promotes those who follow the rules and do as their told.   Independence is only a word banded about of the 4th of July.  Ritalin is  and was always bad for children and now we as nation are dealing with  adults addicted to drugs who get thrown in jail for doing what was done to  them in their youth.  I say put the doctors, parents and teachers in jail  who  made these kids that way.  Thank you very much--that will be all.	2000-08-09

I don't think many of us could endure all that Roz Carr did  for as long as she did.  There was humor, there was romance, there was  elephants, there was fun, and there was such unspeakable horror that was  never really reported in the media.  Someone complained that they didn't  like the political slant in the story but that's like saying you don't like  War and Peace because of the politics in the book.  The politics of that  region IS the story otherwise it would've been just another adventure book  by a white woman in Africa.  This woman had the courgage and strength you  read about in pioneer stories.  And then she took on all those poor  children and put her life on the line constantly as well as her partner.   They both deserve medals.  I was amazed at how much was covered in the  small amount of pages this book had.  This is a woman young girls can look  up to as an example of courage and determination.  And the fact that she  was in her '80's and still kept on like a younger woman is very astounding.   This story was magnificant!	2000-08-08

I find it hard to believe that if you had someone as a friend since kindergarten you would suddenly not stay in  touch.  Hank and Joe were such stand in characters, and come on -- what  grown up woman has to call her dad to say she wasn't coming home that  night.  She made use of the word &quot;hugged&quot; too and not in the way  you hug people.  And of course, everyone is beautiful with beautiful blue  eyes, beautiful blonde hair, beautiful, beautiful. Stop, before I hurl.  I  can tell by most of these reviews that the readers don't read a lot of  quality novels.  And one thing that irked me was the underground parking at  LAX.  All the parking structures I've been in at LAX are right across from  the terminal about 4 stories high. Clue me in if you know.  And of course  that hair dresser had to be loud.  The intimate scenes were handled pretty  well but the AAA was a total drag and I sped read through it.  True, the  story had it's twists and turns but it wasn't as great as it was blown up  to be.  It was a cutesy feel good middle america book.	2000-07-21

Especially now with the Bastille Day celebration just over (July 14) in France.  When I talk books with other people I mention it  as one of the better classics.  It's sad, and funny too at times.  This is  the sort of book I want in a bound sewn together book instead of glued  together.  If you are in school and have to read a classic I say get this  one.  If you're sick of the junk that's out there, tired of your computer  screen, tired of your endless choices on satellite tv, and want to sink  into an oldie, get this one.  Once you get into the lingo of the language  you just zoom away.  A little period music in the background couldn't hurt.  &quot;Let Them Eat Cake&quot; was never more distinct although I don't  recollect a direct quote from Marie on the matter.	2000-07-18

Sagan was on tv after all so he must be right in everything.  Not only that he wasn't ugly or geeky like some some of those types could be.   And even the ones who aren't just couldn't show well on tv or be popular.   That's what it really boils down to.  Carl Sagan, good ole boy trained by  the old school must be loyal to the closed scientific world.  I've read  Worlds in Collision twice and have great respect for Immanuel Velikovsky.   His work will always be debated because the &quot;white american and  european world&quot; can not accept anything without their stamp of  approval. And heaven forbid anyone should write or think to the contrary!  Charles Ginenthal was pretty cool to write this book -- right on!  For  another awesome take on this subject read: &quot;Red Earth, White  Lies&quot; by Vine Deloria Jr.  Open your eyes people, don't be duped by  academia - knowledge rules!	2000-07-12

I kept thinking, where was he when I was there?  This  was a wonderful story and the references to rock stars was pretty  clever...especially the bit about Jim Morrison whom I really like.  It's  funny since Jim made references to himself as harboring an Indian soul  which led me to believe that this is the reason Alexie wrote of him in a  not so favorable light.  I watched the movie &quot;Smoke Signals&quot; and  read his Indian Killer too.  In Reservation Blues, I liked the references  to all the horses and the dead generals who crop up out of history.  This  isn't your usual story by any means and that's what makes it so worthy and  wonderful to read.  Alexie writes magically and poetically and sure knows  his history.  Did anyone know he was writing about Crazy Horse in one of  the dreams of the young rockers?  The drinking, the poverty, the sadness  it's all real and not make believe.  Not anywhere near it.  I think urban  teenagers should read this book and next time they can't go to Hawaii or  max out on their parents credit card should count their blessings.  These  sad reservations post-teens are just a quick glance at the truth that's  hidden from our eyes by the media.  All we are ever shown is silly movies  like Dances With Wolves with that dopey white non-actor guy  &quot;saving&quot; the Indians.  Why must Hollywodd and white books always  protray such nonsense?  The only thing Native Americans want to be saved  from is becoming like us and our hateful religion, and saving their  religion and names from demented New Agers and softball teams.  Sherman  Alexie, keep writing those wonderful stories and come down to smog town  soon so we can hear you -- enit!	2000-07-11

Although I found the story to be a bit unstructured at times it was truly wonderful.  I think a map of the area and a drawing of the boat would have  helped.  I skipped the part about the hooks and gear, it was so confusing.   The technical structure of waves and hurricane was really great and I told  myself I would come back and read more of that.  The part about the waves  being so high and the wind &quot;slinging&quot; the tops of the waves was  fantastic.  I especially liked the rescue of the PJ's.  Now that was very  very scary and exciting.  My heart was pounding by then.  Can you imangine  someoone in a 30 wave above you that you are trying to save?   Not me --  Wow!.  And last but not least the poor souls who appeared as ghosts was  very haunting.  I've heard so much about the ghosts of sailors and I  believe it can be so true.  I'm glad a movie is being made and that these  hard working sailors in their dangerous work is being brought to our  attention.  Here we are eating swordfish and not even being aware of the  dangerous journey it made to the store.  Our hats our off to you sailors  everywhere!	2000-06-23

It makes so much sense about many things I used to question in our mostly boring science class.  Once we were giants, CO2 has a bearing on growth, mammoths were alive in modern history, comets dumped  snow, etc., and best of all:  The Bering bridge is lie and so is the La  Brea tar pits, and evolution is not tied up in a tidy package.

I keep glancing up to see if the waves would stand up in the air, or rather imagine how it could be.  It certainly made  the Biblical flight from Egypt, and Away in a Manager far better than  history-lying Disney or Speilberg could EVER conceive.  Veloskvy was a very  intelligent person who wrote this when the &quot;establishment&quot; railed  against him because to them his ideas were out of line and outrageous to  say the least.  I've read some of the negative comments and even though   one can express their opinion I think these negative types believe  everything they read in a text book and never question the status quo.   We've really been brainwashed by academics for so long we don't know that  we don't know. I hope this book gets published again and even in paperback  so I can keep it.	2000-05-31

I'm a RW buff and hardly ever, and never in school's histroy books was this subject touched upon and to me it really had an  astounding effect on the war.  I didn't know that people in the 13 states  feared for their lives when the British offered freedom to the slaves if  they joined up with them.  And then after the long war, slave owners came  up from the south looking for them and dragging them out of bed.  The story  was to the point with a lot of interesting personal stories.  I think this  book should be put in all schools and this side of history should not be  avoided.  I suspected Jefferson was a jerk long ago and this confirms it  even more.  All these leaders of our country spouting words of liberty and  owning hundreds of slaves.  How could they have thought it was part of  God's plan and design?  .	2000-03-09

I've read many novels about Native Americans and this one reminds me of some new age person who has the  facts and language down, but it's really boring and drons on and on.

Although this book took forever to read between work (lunch time only) and caring for a toddler, (after the nightly news) ect.  I didn't care.  It was such a  joy to read and I looked forward to reading it.  I found myself gripping  those thin pages and wondering what would happen next because unlike many  ho-hum USA books it was so unpredictableand and very rewarding.  Mushashi's  strive for the WAY reminded me of the story of Crazy Horse and his  relationship with The Great Spirit.  To me they are the same with a  differeant name.   I especially liked Otsu and laughed with mirth at  Jakarto's antics.  Takuan was especially cool and wish there were more men  like him in this world.  What I want to know is -- what ever became of  Musashi?  As a real person I know he wrote the Book of Five Rings but when  I try to look up some info about him on the web all I get is this book.   Did he ever get married and have children?  Did he have a school?  I liked  the references to nature in this great story.  Hey, it's too bad they only  had Sake to drink; that stuff can stand you on your ear.  If you're a  female and think this book is only for guy's - don't.

My boss at the time said &quot;Why don't you just see the movie&quot;.  Well, sure I did but books you can carry around.   However, this book didn't appeal to me as  much.  I read only to the part where Ed Masterson died.  Maybe it was  because it was a big heavy book and the print was small, but the historical  stuff was a bit much as was the speech pattern of Jack Crabb.  I've read  too many historical accounts to appreciate JC's version of history.  Maybe  I'll give this book another whirl when I can carry it on my camping trip  and read it beside a crackling fire.  Otherwise, I think it's a fine book  and great for anyone who hates dull historical facts (like me - ha, ha).   After all, it was Little Big Man who was responsible for killing my hero  &quot;Crazy Horse&quot;.  That's the true historical fact, and if you want  to read a truly great book about him there's &quot;Crazy Horse&quot; by  Maria Sandoz.	1999-05-19

Kids just don't kill out of nowhere and blaming Hollywood is a mute point really.  This book will make you stop and ask yourself if you really can afford to have kids, and I don't mean financially.  I've seen people who you would  swear were born without souls and it all goes back to the cradle.  I was  glad to finish this book because it was extremely depressing and at times I  was close to tears.  We must protect and love our little babies, hold them  close, kiss them and yes SLEEP with them.  We had a family bed and our  daughter is a very well adjusted child because of that.  After she was born   I told the doctor she was sleeping with us (4 months) and he was very  critical and said to get her out immediately!  Well, I got rid of him  immediately and continued to nuzzle my little treasure and kiss her little  round head and turned up nose.  For thousands of years babies slept with  their mom's and it's only recently in the USA where it's been taboo for  some stupid reason.  You mothers who sleep with your babies KEEP ON DOING  IT.  It will save you money by not buying cribs and gimmicy sheets and  such, not to mention the special closeness and bonding you experience.    It's sad that a lot of mothers can't stay home with their babies because  they have to work since corporate america for the most part considers  children to be non-existant.  And then there's that consumer frenzy.  How  many SUV's, cell phones, and extra clothes do we really need.  We don't  need it, WE DON'T!!!!  I blame consumerism for the downfall of our nation  and the destruciton of the family and children.	1999-03-12

Anyway, this book was so great I had  to have my M&amp;M's and/or Kisses handy.  Hershey's chocolate tends to be  a little, just a wee bit now, gritty and if you drink a Coca-Cola or eat  ice cream along with it it gets hard and isn't melting.  Such is the nature  of chocolate I guess.  They both have great products, but when it comes to  chocolate Holland and Switzerland wins hands down!	1999-03-12

It isn't just about Custer, it's about nearly everyone in this surreal true story.  All the events seem like the Twilight Zone and that's no joke.  It is a  very long story but well worth it.  I tell my friends about some incident  in this book and they are truly amazed.  A few parts I particularly liked  were the parts about  Harrington; the actual morning star rising before  Custer attacked a village (before Bighorn);  the reflection in the clouds  when they were marching off to their death; and the famous scaled guy who  rose up among the dead bodies when the boat reached Denver.  Chilling, but  true.  Even for those who hate histroy, this book packs a wallop.	1999-02-22
US	52930284	R2R6IC3QOAVL6F	0140233911	538490549	The Garlic Ballads	Books	4	7	9	N	N	Chilling	We take our freedom of speech for granted in the USA.  In China, one word  out of line and you could be in the slammer.  You could try to defend  yourself and your family and still face a jail cell.  This book had my  heart in clutches.  Warning:  Don't read this book while you're eating  since there's a few gross scenes.  The &quot;wedding&quot; in the end far  surpassed any late night horror shows; and the rooster pecking scene had my  stomach churning.  And the curses people yelled at each other are pretty  funny and original.  I read this book was banned in China after the famous  uprising in the &quot;Square&quot;.  Mo Yan is such a great writer.  Where  is he anyway?  I wish there were more books coming out of China; there is  such an untapped source of orginality and perspective.  I Mo Yan's  wonderful &quot;Red Sorghum&quot; and many aspects of that still linger in  my mind.  I hope he contines writing more and more because I will snatch  his books up quickly.	1998-10-19
US	52930284	R6LTQOX71NVH1	0446605808	438507264	The Art of Breaking Glass	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Appealing	I read this book pretty fast because it was quite a read.  In the end it  got a little much.  I just can't imangine Sharon being such a hero and  outwitting the FBI so many times; especially since they were  &quot;tracking&quot; her, come on!.  The lobotomy part was quite gory, and  I especially liked the scene on the Citicorp building.  I mean, just  thinking of that building being blown up blows me away.  For American pulp  this was certainly a little better than most.  But to compare it to Hanibal  Lector is a bit much.  Why can't this book stand on its own since it really  was nothing like Hanibal?	1998-10-14

I had great expectations for  this book but the excercises alone would take a year to do.  As I read I  kept getting more turned off and looking ahead to see if there were  anything new.  I certainly like the journal idea but that isn't new. I  finally gave up, returned the book and bought something else...	1998-10-06

A long time ago I read RPW's &quot;Band of Angels&quot; which I liked but forgot the writer until I saw this book right beside it.  I was so amazaed at this story and the very rounded characters.  I really liked Jack Burden and as the story went on and incidents came to light I was just surprised.  Usually I can figure things out before they happen but this book was one thing after another.  A few weeks ago I was longing for a good book to read maybe about the south and an old book and presto this book jumped off the shelf to me.  (Well, not literally).  You can taste this book, the words just want to roll around in your mouth like good food, and you can feel the weather, and feel the sea against your skin, you can see the cotton fields, you feel the gritty red dirt.  This book is like a Thanksgiving dinner and I will have to say it's one of the best books I have ever read and I have read about 1,000 or more in my life I'm sure.  I like the part when Willie realizes he's a sap and gets up to address the crowd as hicks and rednecks.  Then there's that part about how all a man needs is something, something and Coca-Cola.  Yeah, I thought Coca-Cola is real big down south and it was good back then before they messed with the formula.  You know the old green bottles that you had to pop off and it burned sweet and cold down your throat in that dusty delta bayou.  Take this book, read it, let it be your pal.	1998-08-07

I wish this writer would get more recognition on talk shows and other media.  His name just doesn't crop up enough and he has a gift that classical writers posess.  So many times you hear about these writers who are the hottest item but they soon fade like the paper of their yellow crumbly pages.  Paul Watkins is a classic and I have to force myself not to buy his books until I've finished the one I'm currently reading.	1998-08-05

That old black and white one was so creepy I'm sure a lot of people passed it by owing to the judge-a-book-by-its-cover syndrone.  &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; is the best reflection of LA noir that I have read.  It is just wonderful and the characters are pretty tragic.  When we had the riots and I saw the city burning I could not help but think of this book and its haunting prophecy.  If you're hemming and hawing about what to read on your summer vacation snap this one up right away, but don't expect sunshine and roses.  Well, actually there is sunshine seeing as how it's in Los Angeles.  I'm sorry N. West had to die  so soon.  He was a #$%^ good writer.	1998-07-28

I don't know why I didn't return it for an old book I really wanted &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;.  I've turned in less bad books. The charcters were wooden and Creek was someone I'd never want to really meet.  I guess he was slated to be some hunk lover dude but he's more like a dud.  And then this Glass character who started out to be a tough chick cop ends up by Creek's bed side knitting (cucumber covers?) of all things.  And Anna, the main character who gets beat up and is still able to hobble around has gotta be tougher than Zina or whatever that woman is that comes on Saturday nights.  Near the end I just sped read to get through the crap.  I bet the writer did this to make a fast buck, and I will NEVER read any of his other books.  He must've had silver screen in his mind as we wrote this trash.  Don't waste your time reading this junk, Huck Finn will make you so much happier!	1998-06-29
US	52930284	R2FQLUEVJ50Y6G	0425163385	728328440	The Night Crew	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Yawn	I have a pet peeve regarding writers.  This one has all the character using &quot;Ah&quot; or &quot;Aw&quot;.  Not everyone talks this way, so why do writers have to give the same voice to every character.  I picked up this book a week ago because it's about my area and have yet to finish it.  It seems the only books on the market these days are about preverts, mass murderers, physcos and whatnot.  Everyone has a gun, everyone is hip, everyone is a lawyer driving expensive cars, and into golf.  I am so upset.  Where are the Dickens and Twain's of this age?  It's an ok book but I certainly won't buy any more of his stuff.  Call me disapointed.	1998-06-23

A few years ago I read a comic book sized paperback about Disney which was published outside USA (of course) which pointed out how Disney really brainwashes people.  And it's so true.  Why do they always have the cartoon women with breast bigger than that other dumb icon Barbie.  There's always a love interest, and always dumb stupid animals or plates that talk, not to mention how they lie about history or wreck a classic like &quot;The Hunchback...&quot; where everyone lives happily ever after.  I HATE Disney and all it represents.  A few weeks ago at that posioning hole McDonalds, they had these cups with Disney's aminal park on it and we were saying how Disney doesn't care for animals they just want to make money, and the VERY NEXT DAY the news comes out about all these dead animals.  People wake up, the devil is not in hell playing cards, he is walking around in a Mickey suit.  At work, so many  employees wear those horrid shirts and hats with stupid Disney characters on it.  Will I take my kids to Disney?  I'd rather take my kid to a real place like Yosemite.	1998-06-09

Yes, it's predictable, (as Kirkus Review on its high horse spouts), quaint and all that.  Most books are of this kind.  So what, that doesn't diminish the fact that it's still good. I enjoyed the little garden tips, the description of the grassy plains, and the part about burnt toast coffe is interesting.  There's a coffee roasting store near where I live and when I drive by I'm struck by the scent of burnt toast.  Really! Go figure.  This is a peaceful story and that rooster is something else.	1998-03-24

It was all so predictable and the strive for that down home flavor came out rather burnt.  What's with all these lawyer books anyway but a response to what's popular these days.  Fifteen years or so ago it was cop books, now anything with a scent of lawyers is a sell, and this one could've been better.  Heck, I could write a dang lawyer book and I don' know nuttin'.  Don't waste your hard earned dollars, or your data weary brain on this one.	1998-02-18

These days he writes with the big screen in mind.  I remember reading &quot;The A--- Strain&quot; centuries ago and it was really D--- good.  Someone mentioned &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; which is very good because it's based on a true (note:TRUE)story so MC can't stick any lizard aliens in it.  (Why are all aliens lizard-like anyway?  What ever happened to semi-human types).  Will I watch this move?  No way, with a dopey cast like that. Did I read the book?  I don't have to, I have telepathy.	1998-02-18
