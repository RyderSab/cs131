The setting was very modern and unsuspenseful.  To be honest, writing a review about this book is as boring as the book itself.  It definately ranks among one of the worst in the series.

While it  does not rank among the worst of the set, it lacks suspense.  I liked the aspect of not knowing whether Bowden was friend or foe and the fact that it it one of the last times the brothers remain in Bayport.  Certainly a worth read, but there are other books much better in the set.	2001-10-27

The book did not live up to its appealing title and is over rated.  While it ranks as one of the best volumes in the set, it ranks among the worst of the early volumes.  There is actually one criminal Carl Schaum, captured on page 59.  Outside of the brothers going through the caves during the middle chapters the book was rather medicore.  The revision (1964) was horrible.  Still the book is a definite read as are all the early volumes.	2001-08-16

The book focused heavily on the title which I liked and presented a fairly good mystery although the ending was not that great (last Chapter).  Overall however this was not a bad book, The plot flowed along nicely throughout the early chapters and there were some fairly humerous parts to the book.  The Revision I never liked.  Much too modern.<br />Orginal: Rated B   Revision: Rated C-	2001-08-16

I think the Syndacate had other ideas and let McFarlane finish The Melted Coins and World War II end before letting the hammer fall.   In 1945 when the war ended this book was published then the heat was put on the author to bring the Hardy's into the scientific age.  Like any of us at work, when change is implemented, we react with negativity.  McFarlane at this point I feel became uninterested in the series and wrote his worst book to date only to be surpassed in 1947 by The Phantom Freighter.   The book was average by the sets standards but sub par by McFarlane's standards.   The revision was not much worse.  Taxidermy become the sub plot and fingerprinting is performed for the first time in the series in this volume.  The child like innocence held in the earlier volumes is now gone.  <br /> ORIGINAL Rated C+ Revision: Rated C	2001-08-16

He declined writing The Secret Panel, but accepted the job writing this volume in 1947.  The book however is lame.  In plain English,  it sucks.  There is virtually no plot and little interation between the criminals and the Phantom Freighter, which does not really appear until the final chapters.  The ending is horrible and according to legend McFarlane quit writing the book at Chapter 22 and let his wife finish the rest.  It would be his last Hardy Boys book, replaced by George Wilson in 1948.  The revision mirrors the original and was simply cut down in size.  The book lacks suspense, thrills, excitement, humour and adventure.  It simply contains the eccentrics of Mr. McClintock a man who is not happy at all with anything.  McFarlane at this stage may have been writing about himself.  A pitty that the best author the set ever had should make this his Swan song. Original: Rated F   Revision: Rated F	2001-08-16

The plot is an excellent one, never quite equaled by the other volumes.  The book begins in innocence and coasts through the first 10 chapters.  From page 110 onward it is difficult to put it down if you are reading it for the first time.  The Sleuth plays a prominent role and the mood is tense throughout the latter chapters.  The revision in my mind was excellent.  I truly loved both books and although the revisions lost the appeal and liesurly pace that the originals had, the revision of this book excedes the early chapters of the original.  The latter chapters of the original were better than the revision.  Both were excellent. Original: Rated A.  Revision: Rated A	2001-08-16

This stupid dog was a total distraction to the mystery from here on in any book that the animal was in.  The book was boring throughout until the end when it actually got quite better.  It was not the worst of the set but ranks a bit below average.	2001-07-28

The book kicks into action around page 70 and is non-stop suspense from there on.  Its actually one of the few books that has a good mystery in the story and the cliff hangers at the end of each chapter are well thought out.  In my opinion most of the Nancy Drew books were awful.  The set is over rated.  Of the original 56 books, about 25 of them are good.  Half the set.  This ranks in at #2 with me.	2001-07-28

Its worth reading, but ranks among the average of the set.  It is an adventerous book, full of that.  Little suspense and little mystery however.  The publishers in 1959 & 1960 published back to back Nancy Drew & the Hardy Boys stories about Alaska/Hawaii & then added an Oriental book.  Drew's The Mystery of the Fire Dragon, published the same year as Chinese Junk, correlates with Chinese Junk.  Devil's Paw was about Alaska, and Drew's volume #36 about Hawaii.  All this robs from all four volumes.  I liked the characters in Chinese Junk.  They seemed to have personality.  Again average, but worth reading.	2001-05-17

My favorites were The Secret of Wildcat Swamp and Hunting For Hidden Gold, but Cabin Island was a  very well written book.  The plot was complex and interwoven.  It was like  several stories, all interconnected were being related simultaneously.  I  cannot rate it a 5 star as there were several other books deserving of that  rating.  But Cabin Island rates a strong strong 4 star rating.	1999-10-12

It lacked thought and skillful writing.  All the suspense was created with potential dangers such as a car crash, a boat crash, someone falling, at the end of each  chapter only to be rescued at the start of the next.  Big Deal!  I could  write that.  This book lacked an intricate plot that are found in so many  of the other books.  Very boring, unsuspenseful reading.     I love The  Hardy Boys Stories and to have a best book, you also need a worst.  They  cannot all be 5 stars.  I rate an average book a 3.  In my opinion, this  just happens to be the worst book in the set.	1999-09-09

They cranked out only a few good books after 1956's The Secret of Pirates Hill.  The Sting of The Scorpion was no exception.  It was certainly not  the worst in the set but it is down there.  I think by that point, the  essence of what the Hardy Boys were had been lost.	1999-09-09

I never liked the fact that I think after volume #37, the Sleuth was never mentioned or mentioned only rarely and that the Hardys never stayed in  Bayport.  The writers used other setting to eat up pages of writing, so  instead of reading a mystery we were given a geaography lesson.  For these  reasons I drop the Shattered Helmet a couple notches, but it was good  enough to warrant a 3 star rating.	1999-09-09
