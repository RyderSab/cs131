Houston gives us a design for using the imagination as a tool for personal growth. The book is a workshop for personal development. Houston provides the reader with exercises to develop four realms--sensory, psychological, mythic, and  spiritual. This is not a book of concepts and theories but of practical  exercises for becoming more of who you are meant to be.	2000-04-30

Her characters are not exceptional people with exceptional lives. We get to peak in on their  lives for only a short period. However, it is a time that proves to be  disruptive to the order of things in all their lives. The book illustrates  how fragile and tentative are our own life stories. A single incident can  quickly change the order of our lives.	2000-04-27

The writing is not exceptional and the story's possibilities could have been more fully developed. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the story and found the hairs on the back of my neck standing up. A good,  old-fashioned ghost story with a shocking ending.	2000-04-22

The book gives a good overview of e-commerce. I liked the margin notes. The resource guide at the back of the book listing all the websites  referred to in the book is useful. I found the chapter with interviews of  sccessful e-commerce merchants to be the most interesting. I recommend this  book to anyone wanting to start a business on the web. The experienced  e-commerce entrepreneur, however, will find this guide too elementary. As  an &quot;Unofficial Guide,&quot; the book purports to give the inside  scoop. I found nothing that I hadn't already read elsewhere. This volume is  a solid beginner's guide and reference but don't expect to learn any  secrets that will put you ahead of the many other businesspeople flocking  to the internet.	2000-04-21

There are many forms of power. Hillman describes a wide variety of powers, such as control, ambition, leadership, charisma, tyranny and many more. Hillman gives the  reader a different perspective on each form of power. He does not judge  certain types of power as being good or bad. He helps us see each kind in a  new light. It is Hillman's premise that power resides in our ideas about  power. We are ruled by the power of ideas. If we are to become more  effective as leaders and managers, we must become aware of how we think  about power. No one definition of power is adequate. We must recognize that  power is multifaceted and we must be prepared to exercise power in its many  forms if we are to succeed.	2000-04-15

This book is an excellent introduction to Schweitzer's views on art, music, philosophy, religion, ethics, colonialism, science, and more. What I found frustrating  is that the book consists of short extracts from Schweitzer's writings. It  is like looking at still photographs of scenes from a movie rather than  watching the complete film. Or eating appetizers and never getting the full  meal. The book's format did not allow me to experience the fullness of  Schweitzer's thoughts on any subject. To be fair, the editor, Charles R.  Joy, states that it is his hope that the reader will be motivated to read  Schweitzer's works in their full as a result of reading this anthology. I  appreciated the biographical chronology at the end of the book. It gave a  good overview of Schweitzer's work and extensive travels.	2000-04-08

Russell leaves both possibilities open. We may be accelerating ourselves toward annihilation or toward the climax of evolution. The answer is within us. It will be our success or  failure to develop inwardly that will determine which path we take. Russell  writes short, pithy chapters that will move you from exhiliration to  despair.

Reading this book takes concentration, though. It is like putting together a puzzle. At times I was unclear and confused about what piece I was  looking at.

This novel is different from most in that it is written so that the reader is listening to someone's story related rather  than the reader feeling s/he is there as the story happens. The style  matches that of someone telling you his experience as you listen. This  makes the style somewhat choppy and sometimes confusing as to who is  speaking, the narrator or another character. Nonetheless, I found myself  gripped by the tale. I read the book in one sitting.	2000-03-13

This book goes beyond the hype and gives practical suggestions for developing one's own emotional intelligence at work.Hendrie Weisinger, a  psychologist and organizational consultant, defines emotional intelligence  as the ability to &quot;intentionally make your emotions work for you by  using them to help guide your behavior and thinking in ways that enhance  your results.&quot; Weisinger contends that EI can be nurtured, developed,  and augmented. He proves his point by providing processes and exercises to  help the reader develop self-awareness, manage emotions, motivate self,  communicate effectively, develop interpersonal expertise, and help others  help themselves.Weisinger writes in an easy to read, straightforward style.  His approach is practical. This makes it especially useful for those  responsible for delivering EI training. This is not a book about EI  research but a manual for making EI work in the workplace. An added bonus  is that developing your EI will also strengthen your personal  relationships. If your interest is in becoming more emotionally intelligent  or helping others to do so, then reading this book would be an intelligent  choice.	2000-01-28

The book gives us a view of  leadership through the eyes of classic authors. What I found disappointing  was the lack of any coherent view of leadership or practical methods for  implementing any of the lessons learned from literature. The author does  provide business examples of the lessons illustrated in the classic  literature. An interesting book to read but I came away without any new  insights into leadership and how to lead.	1999-12-04

Corporate America has got religion. So it would seem with all the business books and product advertisements that appeal to the soul. Spirituality seems to have become the latest business strategy.This new release from  Jossey-Bass explores spirituality, religion, and values in the workplace.  The authors share the results of surveys and interviews they conducted with  over two hundred organizational leaders. What emerged from the research are  five models of organizational spirituality. Mitroff and Denton share the  strengths and limitations of each model. The last chapter of the book  blends the best from each model to propose a best-practice model for  integrating soul into an organization.Why be concerned about your  organization's spirituality? According to Mitroff and Denton, the future  success of your business depends upon it. They contend that spirituality  may well be the ultimate competitive advantage and the management of  spirituality is one of the most fundamental tasks of management.Mitroff and  Denton strive to bring a scientific approach to the study of spirituality  in organizations. This is no airy New Age vision or dogmatic diatribe.  However, the authors are passionate about the need to create soul-nurturing  organizations. The book is worth reading. When you finish you, too, may see  the light. Say, Amen!	1999-11-09
