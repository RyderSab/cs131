I like Bono, too, but it matters little what endorsement Bono gives Dake's material, as it stands on its own.<br />In my opinion, Finis Jennings Dake is the finest Spirit-filled, Faith-oriented theologian/Bible teacher of the 20th century. Although many have set out to undermine the reputation of this dear saint of God and giant of the faith, they can't shut him up; his writings live on, the most prominent of which is &quot;God's Plan For Man.&quot;<br />It's all here--1000 pages of the most concise, balanced, and profound doctrine concerning everything from the pre-adamic world to the return of Christ. There are also hundreds of pages of teaching on the basic &quot;how-to's&quot; of everyday Christian life--how to pray, what promises are available to the Christian today, the baptism in the Holy Spirit, a step by step exposition of the Lor's prayer, holiness, faith, putting complete trust in the word of God, miracles, deamons, angels, and everything else--EVERYTHING!<br />There are a few teachings that many will be troubled by, but I implore you to read such teachings in the context of Dake's overall view of man and his relationship to the spiritworld, God, angels, deamons, etc. Dake rightly contends that the beings of the spiritual world (angels, demons, and even God Himself) are as real and physical as we are, sighting a limitless number of scriptures to support his teachings.<br />And that is a point I can't stress enough: Dake profusely refers the reader to the Bible. My guess is he has cited tens of thousands of scriptures. I have yet to read a single claim made by Dake that is not generously supported with scripture.<br />Although most would use this work topically, I stronly suggest one sit down and read it all the way through. It will take a while, but it will surely be the most rewarding extended Bible study you've ever embarked on.<br />&quot;God's Paln For Man&quot; is a must for every Spirit-filled believer!<br />P.S. Get the Dake study Bible, too!	2003-05-04

The life and ministry of Oral Roberts is one of the most influencial and controversial of any minister of the 20th century. Although one might dismiss Oral Roberts, relegating him to the catagory of many other TV Evangelists who fell by the wayside in sins, hype, and irrelevance, it must be said of Oral Roberts that he, unlike the overwhelming majority of his time, finished the race. He stayed clean. He has left behind a legacy of power, innovation, and endless possibilities for the future of all of his spiritual children.<br />It was Oral Roberts that pioneered the use of TV as a means of evangelism. It was Oral Roberts that modernized the church's concept of its relationship to God as healer, provider, and, answerer of prayers based upon His Word. More than any other minister of the last century, Oral Roberts Evangelized the world with the truth most Christians rejected and denied completely: 3John:2 \\"Beloved I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.\\" I don't think we fully appreciate just how ground breaking this revelation was in the 50's and early 60's. His slogan \\"something good is going to happen to you\\" was lambasted by religious pharisees. Their contention was the thought was \\"too presumptuous\\" and was liable to \\"get the people's hopes up too high.\\"<br />\\"Expect a Miracle\\" is a fair representation of Brother Roberts' life and ministry overall. However, I do wish he would have been more direct and addressed some of the more troubling aspects of his ministry. Although he lightly addressed the matter, I would have liked to have seen him flat out apologize and repent for the 8 million dollar fiasco in the 80's. I have no doubt that God may very well have told him his assignment on earth would end if he failed to upkeep his medical school, but Brother Roberts should have addressed the fact that his manner of appealing on TV saying, \\"won't you spare my life,\\" to get his \\"partners\\" to give him 8 million dollarswas extreme and is still an embarassment for his spiritual children. Subsequently, such incidents are a blemish on his legacy, and in many ways the body of Christ's, which I believe could have been repaired had he not avoided the issue in the years that have passed since then. This autobiography was a great opportunity to do just that, but he unfortunately passed.<br />Every spirit filled believer should consider this book required reading. Let history show. Oral Roberts is a rare gem in church history. He paved the way for modern Spirit-filled ministers like no other in his time. He truly was \\"God's man for this hour!\\"<br />God bless you, Brother Roberts! And thank you for the abundant spiritual inheritance you have left us!	2003-05-03

Dr. Atkins, who recently passed away, was without question the pioneer of the low-carb diet. His work showed us conclusively that it wasn't the fat persey but the carbs in our food that were causing so many of us to retain weight, keeping us from losing it without great difficulty.<br />Since then, the big dilema has been how does one come off carbs if they've been so dependant upon them for years. Many found Dr. Atkins' methods to restrictive and unreasonable. His princepals were good, but his methods needed work. Many have offered their own plans and diets based on Dr. Atkins' research. Most notably was \\"Sugar Busters,\\" but even celebrities like Suzzanne Summers offered their own versions of the Atkins diet.<br />I think Dr. Agatston's 'The South Beach Diet' has gotten it right. Yes, the first two weeks will be tough but overall the plan is easy and it works!<br />If you're already familiar with the Atkins plan but can't seem to get it working for you, here's the diet book for you!

Also, I happen to prefer the \\"Open\\" with its dictionary at the beginning of the book, as it makes a nice buffer between Genesis and the cover. It greatly reduces wear in the spine in the first couple of books. The full color pages in the \\"Nelson\\" that I just mentioned make thumbing through the Bible a little difficult, as your page flipping becomes hindered by passing a glossy thick page every fow hundred pages. They just make the book overall open and lay awkwardly. The \\"Open's\\" layout is simpler and better, I think, and leaves much more Bible text per page. It's not cluttered with hundred of magazine-article like topic headings. In short, it's not worth the money to switch to the Nelson.<br />Now, if you have neither, I suppose the best idea is to get a \\"Nelson.\\" For one, the \\"Open\\" is discontinued, so I guess you'd have no other choice in most cases, depending on which edition you're interested in, although there are still a few \\"Opens\\" for sale on Amazon. Overall, the \\"Nelson\\" is very full and informing. It makes a great secondary Bible, and if you don't mind many pages containing only a few paragraphs of Bible text, a great primary Bible.<br />Doctrinally, the \\"Nelson\\" is fairly middle of the road. Pretty much any Christian would find this Bible usefull and non-threatening to their personal beliefs.<br />Of all of the major study Bibles, the Nelson is quite the best choice for anyone.	2003-04-27

Madame Jeanne Guyon's guide to prayer is by far the most imortant book on the subject I've ever read. I could never recommend a more useful guide to prayer.<br />The book is short and sweet--to the point. And although it can be read in a single sitting, you'll definately want to slow down to digest each page. In fact, that's precisely what Madame Guyon recomnmends of her readers. She teaches one of the most significant principles of prayer: felloship with God through meditating on portions of His word (the Bible). She recommends sitting down in a quiet place with your Bible and reading it slowly and carefully. And when you happen upon a particularly moving passage, slow down and dwell on that passage in a prayerful, meditative fashion.<br />And there is so much more here, too. Too much to mention in a brief review.  It's enough to say that this classic is an irreplaceable guide. Anyone will be made better at prayer by this book. It's definately one of those books one will return to year after year, ever refreshing their spirits with the simplicity of Madame Guyon's methods of prayer.	2003-04-27

First I'll deal with the Dake itself, and then the two versions, the Standard and the Compact, and which I'd recommend.<br />For Pentecostal, Spirit-filled, Charismatic, and Word of Faith believers, I could never recommend a more useful study Bible. It's chock-full of not only the basic teachings of Spirit-filled living (i.e., the baptism in the Holy Spirit, faith in God for healing, deliverance, and prosperity) but I'm sure you'll find thousands of insights you've never thought of. Once you begin your journey studing this Bible, you'll be surprised to see how many teachings are here that you heard before from a minister thinking they had fresh from the throne revelation, while all along they were reading the Dake. Yes, there are a few controversial theologies in here; the idea that the Father, Son, and Spirit, each have bodies, souls, and spirits is strange to say the least. But when you read everything Dake has to say on the matter, you'll see he insists the Bible teaches that God is a physical and tangiable as you and I, which is an utterly understated theology in most major branches of Christianity. Overall, Dake is quite balanced. I srtongly admire his unwavering courage to speak things that will without question bring rebuke from more religious critics. The Dake Annotated Bible is an absolute must for ANY Spirit-filled believer!<br />There are 2 versions of this Bible out, both available in hardback and bonded or genuine leather. The Standard is the original printing, in its original page layout and font. It is a 4-colum layout with the notes a size smaller than the already small Bible font. It's not at all a bad printing and I'd be quite happy with it if no other printing were available. However, the Compact is a tremendous improvement to the original. The term Compact really doen't apply, as its main Bible font is larger, as is the notes' font which has been enlarged to match the size of the Bible font. The type is much clearer and easier to read. The layout is good, too. It has 3, instead of 4 colums and each page has a full section of Bible text, with notes relegated to the sides and bottom.<br />Overall, either priting is wonderfull but the Compact is better. I have 2. Both genuine black leather, one Compact, one Standard. They are both top-notch Bibles. The leather is soft and well done. The paper is of the highest quality. Wonderful in everyway.<br />Get a Dake! You'll be glad you did!	2003-04-23

I have the utmost respect and admiration for Pastor Benny Hinn. But I must admit how disappointed I've been with his past few books. This one is no exception. It's obviously ghostwritten to a large degree. My guess is nearly 80% is qhostwritten, and that not even terribly good writing to boot.<br />I expected much more from this particular book, as I'm well aware of the influence Ms. Kuhlman's had on him. Unfortunately, this book is quite a disappointment and I'd have to suggest that one pass on it if they're considering buying it.	2003-04-20

First, let me say a big God bless you to Kenneth Copeland Ministries. They're the publishers of this book.<br />Basically there are three main collections of Lake's sermons out there, all three classics in their own right. First and foremost, there's Robers Liardons 1000+ page collection entitled \\"John G. Lake: The Complete Collection of His Life Teachings\\" (ISBN:1577780752). I strongly recommend that everyone get this collection! It's chock full of the most wonderfull messages you could ever want to read.<br />Then there's \\"John G. Lake Sermons on Dominion over Demons, Disease & Death\\" by Gordon Lindsay (ISBN:0899850286), a brief but well-done collection at under 100 pages.<br />And in the middle we have the Copelands' collection at about 250 pages. Again, very well done, but what I'm getting at is, if you're anything like me, you'll fall head over heals reading Lake's sermons. The Copelands' or Lindsay's books will only serve as appetizers for Liardon's collection.<br />Save money and time. Go straight for Liardon's. You'll be glad you did.	2003-04-20

If you're just looking for a light sample of Brother Lake's messages, this is the book for you. However, if you'd like something more substantial, I highly recommend &quot;John G. Lake: The Complete Collection of His Life Teachings&quot; by Roberts Liardon (Compiler). For little more than what you'll pay for this, you can get a 1000+ page volume of nearly everything ever transcribed for or written by Brother Lake.<br />This book is a classic, however, it's touched so many, long before Liardon compiled his volume, and I prefer to have a copy in my library. You will, too.	2003-04-19

My branch of the Church tends to emphisize prayer, personal devotion, and intimacy with God.

Years ago I came to the conclusion that deep spiritual meditation was at the center of their spiritual lives, yet I was not terribly familiar with what their meditations might have been like. The fear of being \\"new-agey\\" kept me from experimenting on my own and so I spent a great deal of time searching out the Bible for hints of what the people of Bible times did in meditation. I really didn't get much clarity on the matter until I read this book. Kaplan graciously spares his readers from spooky, impractical tecniques and gives intelligent, balanced explanations of the various forms of meditation that more than likely were employed by the greats in Scripture.<br />This book is an indespensible part of my spiritual library now.

If you read my other reviews of Bibles, you'll see I'm a stickler when it comes to various printing and Bible construction methods. I'm not the biggest fan of Thomas Nelson because they always seem to have trouble printing up their Bibles with an even ink color from page to page. This one is no exception, but I'm very pleased by it being available in the New Living Translation.<br />The Open Bible overall is very good. But if you're interested in investing in only one study Bible, I strongly suggest Thomas Nelson's \\"Nelson Study Bible.\\"<br />I'm happy to have this one in my library.<br />[addition] Almost forgot; another great plus is there's a very good dictionary in this Study Bible. The great this is they've placed it before, not after, the Bible. I really like this idea because now Genisis, Exodus, etc. have a nice buffer between themselves and the front cover. This will greatly reduce the wear to the front books of the bible because your opening Genisis 1/4 into the book! Well, I think it's great. Cheers!	2002-04-17

Sister Anna graciously spares us from religious cliche and Bible catch phrases. Instead, she's direct and unapologetic, adding very little personal interjection. She kindly tells us what she saw and experienced and lets us have it as close to first hand as possible without actually being there ourselves.<br />This masterpiece left me numb for days--literally. There's so much in here to digest. I read it straight through in one day. I'm about to read it for the second time.

I'm very happy to finally have an RSV with the Apocrypha. The annotations and section/book introductions are great. It also includes a VERY well-done intro to the Apocrypha. The binding is sewn and flexible--a big plus. The paper is quality and the paragraph-style page layout is great.<br />I have a few peeves, however. The genuine leather is acceptable but a bit stiff, I'd say. Jesus' words are NOT red, granted it wasn't advertised as such. Oxford has very oddly placed all of the Apocrypha and it's indroductory notes at the very end of the book, past the end notes that proceed Revelation. They just kind of slapped the Apocryphal section between the extra blank note pages and the maps. Why they didn't place it between the Old and New Testaments is a mystery to me but that's Oxford for ya! Well, as long as it's got the Apocrypha and all those great notes, I'm happy.	2002-02-26

This particular edition differs a bit from other reviews I've read--no portraits, etc.<br />It's an Oxford, so if it were possible for me to have gotten an NRSV with the Apocrypha in genuine black leather from someone else, I'd have done it gladly. Oxford generally cuts corners in the Bible-making process.<br />Because it will be a secondary Bible for me, I'm not terribly peeved about Jesus' words NOT being red, there being no concordance, and there being no dictionary of any kind. The leather is nice but a bit stiff. The spine, however, is sewn and very flexable--a major plus for a long-lasting Bible.<br />I like the fairly handy size very much. Bibles are gennerally made way too big. The paper is very quality and the font selection and paragraph-style page layout is very nice as well.<br />Reguarding the translation itself: I'm particularly pleased with the traslating of the Old Testament and Apocrypha, well done and very readable. I'm not at all offended with the gender-inclusive rendering with certain passages, as footnotes mark each diversion from the originals. When I began reading the Bible, I started with an original Living paraphrase because the KJV was just too much for me. I soon learned that the translation was so terribly compromised for readability, I was missing out on a lot of important meaning. The NRSV is a fantastic balance between readability and  accuracy, if you ask me. Thinking of giving a Bible to new believer or someone just starting to study it? Give them an NRSV! <br />If you're considering this particular printing for your main Bible, I'd suggest shopping around first. But overall, I'm satisfied.	2002-02-23
