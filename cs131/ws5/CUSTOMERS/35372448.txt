The 7th book, The Persuader, was a bit disapointing. But the series redeemed itself with the 8th book (The Enemy) and now, this one, One Shot.<br />Jack is at his best.  He's a loner with a borderline case of &quot;not my problem&quot; attitude.  But when he gets pulled in, he puts himself all in and goes all out.  He's a sort of hero, not by choice but by carreer.  He's left the army, he's no longer enforcing the law but it's in his blood.  So when he sees injustice, he gets involved.<br />In this book, Reacher gets involved when he sees a news clip and recognizes a man he once made a promise to : Step out of line again and I will find you.  So when Reacher hears the man has killed, he goes to find him.  But not all is as it first seemed and Reacher is left to adjust and rethink the situation.<br />Once again, a good book from L. Child.  Can't wait for the next installment.	2005-07-28

This said, I was a bit disapointed with Rage.  The overall story was good.  But the ending left me wondering.  What really happened?  Did I miss something?  There was a lot of theories put forth by the main characters, Alex Delaware and his friend Milo.  Throughout the story, they speculate as to what was going on but the ending leaves it without proof of... well, anything.  <br />I also was upset about the developments brought forth in Alex's love life.  I don't want to spoil it for readers but it felt funny, the way things went.  <br />SO, I would read it if you are a die-hard fan.  Don't buy it in hard cover...  You can wait for the paperback!  If this is your first novel by Kellerman, don't give up.  It's been better!	2005-06-16

His stories always grab me from the first page and don't let go until the last.  This book is a bit better then the last one (Just one look).<br />The story is that of Matt Hunter, an ex-con trying to get his life back together.  He gets involved in some strange things when he receives a picture of his wife with another man.  It's all &quot;go-go-go&quot; from then on.

I don't know much about the author and wasn't sure if the story of her life would be interesting to me.  But having lived in Utah and having tried &quot;mormonism&quot;, I was curious.  <br />The author does an excellent job at taking us in her life.  She had a very difficult childhood and she takes us through her journey to self-discovery and happiness.  I was touched by her strenghth and I must say I have great admiration for her.  Ditto her husband, who seems like the nicest man.  <br />It's entertaining and inspiring without being too preachy.  A good book to learn more about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormons) at the same time.	2005-06-03

I quite agree with other reviews : this book should not be picked up if you want fast-paced, non-stop action.  Ditto if you are looking for the second coming of Harry Potter.  This book is a whole different story.  I loved the descriptions, the long character developments, the use of old English and the not-so-clear bad versus good war.   <br /> <br />It is a long book.  I read it in a week and a half which, for me anyway, is a long time to read any novel.  But I did enjoy every moment, actually slowing to reread some paragraphs.  It's not a \\"on the edge of your seat\\" kind of book but you do want to know what is coming around the corner.  I also enjoyed the other characters, other then Mr Norrell & Mr Strange.  It's rare in books that you want to know what happens to other, lesser charcaters just as much, if not more so, as you do the main ones.   <br /> <br />As a first novel, this is hard to beat.  As a novel, the research involved must have been incredible!  Hats off to Ms Clarke!	2005-04-15

Again, I was very impressed with this novel by the same author who brought us Bitten, Stolen and Dime Store Magic.<br />The premise of the books is that it's the story of real life Supernaturals, werewolves, vampires, witches, demons, etc... as they live among us today.  Bitten was about a werewolf, Stolen introduced witches and other supernaturals and Dime Store Magic &amp; Industrial Magic are about witches but also has a bunch of others.<br />I'm surprised this book is not more widely read.  The story is interesting, the writing is excellent, the plots are great and I certainly got attached to the characters enough that I want to follow their lives some more.<br />I think if you enjoyed such TV shows as Buffy and Angel, you'll love these books.<br />Pick it up, you won't regret it.	2005-04-06

But I was curious, having read a critic of it in a magazine.<br />Snob is about a young woman in London, who marries a lord.  In this day and age, with all that has been said about monarchy, the Royals and all the Scandals, it is surprising to care at all.  I actually more then cared, I was fascinated.  The author sets about to explain, very clearly indeed, the different way of life that the &quot;higher class&quot; has, or see themselves to have.  He did a fantastic job at explaining the nuances and the traditions of a world that very few of &quot;us&quot; will ever experience.  He pointed out, quite rightly, that we judge it and make fun of it yet, given a chance, we will all want to be invited in (most of us would deny this if asked!).<br />Edith sets about to marry a lord and once she does so, she is surprised to find out exactly what that life is all about.  I don't want to give away too much but we follow her and her friends through a few years.  Suffice it to say that she acts very badly and, yet I saw myself rooting for her, hoping she would pull it off, if only to give it back to a few people that had treated her badly (even if they were right, at times, to do so!).  Throw in a few actors in the mix and it's off to a jolly good time!<br />Pick up this book if you want to be entertained!	2005-03-28

In the beginning of the book, I wanted to find out the truth just as much as reporter Laura.  In the end, I felt the same as she did : empty &amp; sad.  The truth does not always set you free.<br />I loved the setting of this book, a few weeks after September 11, in New York City.  Although the events of that day have nothing to do per se with the events, it does set them in motion.  It's my first book by this author and I was left marvelling at the beautiful prose, the wordly expressions and the images it all brought up for me.<br />This book deserves a lot more press then it has had so far.  Pick it up, you won't regret it.	2005-03-25

But I thought the technical side, with all the information about global warming and the environment was a bit much.  It was way too in-depth.  The story is weighted down by it and things would have been faster and smoother without all the graphics and charts.  The information IS interesting and I have read similar claims as made in the book in journals and magazines yet, I could have done without it in the NOVEL.  Because it is a novel.  And it reads like a university manual in some places. Other then that, I really enjoyed the book, much more then the last Crichton I read.  And I thought the tsunami story was a bit spooky, considering this book came out in early December, just before the tragedy in Asia.  But all in all, I would recommend it.	2005-03-17

I really wasn't interested that much in the parts about Kit Marlowe.  But after a while, I actually wanted to know more about Marlowe!  I liked also how the author weaved the different parts of the story.  It flowed well from present to past. The only part I had difficulty with was the extra story about the missing spy.  That seemed like way too many coincidences.  But still very good story.	2005-02-23

She's not a writer but you can read this book easily.  <br />Ms Frey gives us a lot of information about her relationship with Scott Peterson, accused of murdering his wife, Laci.  I certaintly could have done without all the talks about God and religion.  But Ms Frey needed something to help her deal with her guilt about her relationship with Peterson and if she found solace in religion, good for her.  But I did not need to read about it every other page.<br />The book is short and straight forward.  We find out about some of the conversations that Ms Frey had with Peterson after his wife had disappeared.  It sure explains why he was convicted of the murders!  If a guy can stand at his wife and child's memorial service and talk to his girlfriend, telling her he's in Paris, well...  <br />Not too bad but could have been less about God, more about the case.	2005-02-23

This book features another one of M. Kellerman's characters, Petra Connors.  We have met her in Billy Straight.  Kellerman introduces another person in this book, a young genius named Isaac.  I guess Isaac might make a comeback in a future novel.  Who knows?  <br />The book was nice and interesting.  I liked that we learn more about Petra and her relationship with Eric.  I'm hoping we will see more of Eric in another novel...<br />Without giving the story away, Petra is investigating what looks like a gang shooting when young Isaac comes to her with a possible, previously undetected serial killer-on-the-loose.  This one is undetected because it's a once-a-year thing.  We follow Petra as she tries to solve the gang shooting and starts looking into the June 28 killings.  <br />I enjoyed the back and forth.

Might, I say because this book SHOULD not be compared to The DVC.<br />In the first few chapters, I was looking to compre The Rule of Four to the DVC.  I found the book slow.  But I read on.  And glad I did.  This book is so much more then what it is compared to.  On the back of the book, it is sided with books by Umberto Eco, Scott Fitzgerald and Dan Brown.  Fitzgerald, I know very little.  Eco, while good, can be long and drawn out without reasons.  Brown can spin a mystery like few but his writing is not exactly soul searching and deep in a spiritual sense.  <br />What The Rule of Four does, by the end, is to bring you to a mystery that keeps you wanting to know by going through the lives of many characters, at diffrent time in history and at different places.  It is told in a wonderful way, with understanding of people and their relationships. It is a very incredible book.  A MUST read.<br />If this book should be compared to another, it's The Secret History.

This book, although not at all the kind I usually enjoy kept me in its grip from beginning to end.  The events are far-fetched and unbelievable but it still holds you.  The style of writing is very particular.  There's almost no dialogue yet you know all that is said or done.  I really loved the passage, toward the end of the book where Fernanda goes on and on and the actual sentence is actually pages long!  It's a very passionate, very interesting book.  I really loved.  I think people will either hate or love it.  There is no in-between.  Happy Reading!	2004-04-08

The writing was very ordinary.  The descriptions were poor.  I felt that I could have written this book!  The author has an obvious knowledge of the times but it was not enough to save this book.<br />The main characters were not interesting;  the pace was slow and tedious.  The WHY? WHY? WHY? got on my nerves after a while.  The vocabulary was rehashed over and over.  The same words and expressions coming back.<br />By the end, I was reading one out of three paragraphs, trying to get to something...  I got nowhere.	2004-03-09

It was good but very slow in starting.  I felt like we went all over the place and got to know some characters pretty well while others were pretty much ignored.  We find out who did it but I thought it was pretty much ignored in the end.  <br />I did enjoy the relationship between Peter Decker and Rina Lazarus.  I even liked the religious aspect of the story.  But it was dragged on for way too long.<br />This was my first novel by Ms Kellerman.  I might give another one of her book a try, hoping it will move a bit faster.	2004-03-07

It did not flesh out Clive and Vernon as would be needed.  But the major problem is that the most interesting person, Georges, is only hinted at, at the very end.  I wished he would have been introduced a bit more properly.<br />Still a goor read but by no means equal to Atonement.	2004-03-04

This last one has been my favorite.  A well-rounded mystery with interesting characters.  The story does not give itself away.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I read this book in a couple of days and had a hard time putting it down.  <br />I'm now looking forward to getting my hands on Mr Iles other books.<br />Worth the read!	2004-03-03

It is not great litterature but it's entertaining.  It's fast-paced and you get hooked early on.  I must say, I figured the &quot;who-done-it&quot; quickly but still enjoyed the &quot;why-she/he-did-it&quot;.<br />So, if you're looking for a good book to pack along in your suitcase, grab this one!	2004-02-24

Still, I would like to add my two cents!  It was a well-written, page turner.  I read it pretty fast, less then 2 days.  I enjoyed this book immensely.<br />The reasons I did not give it 5 stars are as follow  :<br />-The story is a little slow at first.  The characters are introduced but they are not clearly defined.  I felt I needed to know more.  I found out who Richard was, in a very superficial way.  But the author may had been better dwelling deeper inside his psyche.<br />-The novel sure picks up but, 3/4 in, it really slows down again.  The funeral was drawn on but we never got an inside look at the parents.  <br />-As mentioned in another review, the characters are not fleshed out enough.  We look at them but we are never allowed a real, inside look.<br />But, all in all, I was amazed at the beauty of this book.  Glad a picked it up.	2004-02-18

Whether you believe the basis of this book, the ultimate merge of man and machine, you will still be held in the grip of this fast pace thriller.<br />The imagination of this author is boundless.  It is a difficult thing to try to capture the essence of God in writting.  From an atheist point of view, it takes a lot to make me believe.

The first few chapters were a bit long, a lot of descriptions.  <br />Once it picks up, the story is incredible.  This author can write about is characters in a way that is almost impossible to describe.  You get in the heads of the people and there is no going back.  Not only is the plot interesting, hte narrative itself is enough to sustain the book.  And, unlike most novels I've read lately, I was SO happy with the ending.  I won't say more so I won't spoil it for other readers.  <br />This was the first novel of this author I've read.  I'm going to read all his books.<br />READ this!	2004-02-11

It describes such &quot;true&quot; human beings.  The people that inhabit the story are fully developed.  They leap from the page and bring you in.  They are real, simple, yet complicated.  You feel for them, you love them and hate them at the same time.  They make mistakes, they give up hope and they find themselves living, going on and discovering the true meaning of love and duty.<br />A great escape, a great book.	2004-02-07

In the end, I think this is a wonderful read.	2004-01-26

This book is not in my usual style/genre of reading.  But I am so glad I read it!  Wow!  <br />What really appealled to me about this book is the setting in a future that you can easily confuse with tomorrow.  It's set in such a way that this future is very credible and almost possible.  The technology is certainly feasible!  And the current events and ideas that make and define us today could lead to a future, as described in Snow Crash!  <br />The history and mythology were also very interesting and the dialogue was smart.  The characters are fully fleshed.  You want to hate Raven but there is something that make you like him, just a bit, against your better judgement.<br />This book is a page turner.  No matter your type of book, this is an awesome read.	2003-12-07

But the ending left me wanting.  I would rather been left wondering then actually having this lame ending.  <br />What saves this novel is the weaving of the two times, from today to the 18th century and back.  It just made it more compelling.  The history is well researched.  I admit that there might have been a tad too many &quot;historical&quot; characters added.  A few would have sufficed.  I could also have done without the cliches...  There are far too many &quot;eyes&quot; descriptions (his eyes were a deep blue, her eyes were so deep, blah blah blah).  Also, please, stay away from the &quot;and this event would change the rest of her life&quot; OR &quot;little did she know the consequences of this action&quot;, type of sentences.  <br />I gave it 4 stars because it's an original, interesting novel.	2003-11-26

It turned out to be much more.  If you want to understand the modern Catholic Church, this book is for you.  It contains an incredible amount of information on how the Church became what it is today.  The authors are brilliant at explaining the history in a very simple yet complete way.  They take the reader through the complexity of the politics behind the religion.  They seperate the State from the Church.  It will surprise you.  I thought I would lose a bit more of whatever respect I had left for the Church after reading this book.  Maybe I did.  But I also gained a profound understanding of HOW it got to be what it is today.  Fan or foe, you should inform yourself about this powerful institution that is the Catholic Church.	2003-11-02
