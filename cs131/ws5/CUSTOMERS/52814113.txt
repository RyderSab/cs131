Humans, it postulates, are a species condemned to struggle against the pain of having \\"a mind capable of conceiving eternity trapped inside a body that dies.\\"  Two energy beings, blind drunk after over-indulging (in what?) at a graduation party on a series of backwater worlds, miss the bus home.  Facing the prospect of eternal boredom, they begin to tinker with the mental capacities of a few unlucky apes, and presto, \\"Christ, Beethoven, Auschwitz, thumbscrews and philosophy, Magna Carta and White Supremacy, poetry, poison gas, nuclear fission and romantic love\\" are born.  Fast-forward to present day, and the two decide to intervene to prevent the marriage of Charity Stovall, an intelligent but unthinking religious hanger-on, and Roy Strider, a small-minded, vicious proto-fascist.  But they do it by show-and-tell, convincing Charity and Roy that they're dead and letting them roam through Heaven and Hell to find wisdom--or damnation (it's your choice, after all).  Highly entertaining, packed with original, witty, novel conceptions and ideas.  (About the only book I can think of that resembles it to a degree: Robert A. Heinlein's \\"Stranger in a Strange Land.\\")  Four stars instead of five only because the characterization is limited in depth.	2005-08-14

Despite the title and hype, there isn't much of that here.  Instead, Turtledove follows a bunch of fairly ordinary folks through long and not particularly compelling narratives.<br />Very disappointing, but then The Two Georges, another letdown, should have warned me.  Turtledove has skill at characterization and can write a crackerjack book when he wants to, but it seems that now he is just riding the crest of popularity and churning them out.<br />Be warned, folks, and give this one a pass.

How equipped are our social  institutions to grapple with a world in which few need to work to produce  an abundance of goods?  The more one thinks about it, the more it becomes  clear that it is a staggering question.  For a more optimistic take, try  James Hogan's &quot;Voyage from Yesteryear,&quot; in which the source of  the abundance is fusion, rather than genetics.  Either way, we are facing  some major issues and need to put our thinking caps on, now.	1999-08-31

It's the best look I have seen so far in fictional form of the issues raised by nanotechnology.  For a thorough nonfiction overview of these questions, see &quot;Unbounding  the Future&quot; by Eric Drexler et al. (and Drexler's Foresight Institute,  which is on the Web).  Nanotech offers unparalleled wealth, an end to most  environmental problems, cheap space travel--but it won't make Serbs and  Albanians friends or solve the population explosion, and it can be abused  in horrible ways.

A terrifyingly plausible, wrenchingly sad view of humanity's future as the controller of a true galactic empire.  I haven't read this one for a while  (just dropped by to see what sort of reviews it had gotten, to find none  yet), and I've read many books since, but &quot;Dark Sky Legion&quot; still  gives me chills just to think about.  Barton doesn't seem a very cheery  fellow, judging from other stories (authored and coauthored) of his I've  read.  Too bad, because he is a very fine writer.  &quot;Dark Sky  Legion&quot; has lots of explicit sex, so give it a pass if that offends  you.

This is #1 on my all-time SF list--a stunning, beautifully written book with new ideas and insights on every page.  Piercy examines in minute detail the question of what a \\"perfect\\" artificial man might really be like, working mostly from the viewpoint of his lover (an expert in artificial intelligence who has worked for one of the multinational corporations that dominate future Earth).  A deeply thoughtful book  with excellent characterization and an all-too-believable, if somewhat  depressing, picture of future society.  While I am primarily an SF fan, I  was so impressed with this that I have delved into a number of Piercy's  other books, many of which are not SF.  \\"Gone for Soldiers\\" is  also highly satisfying and readable (and of course, her other SF novel,  \\"Woman on the Edge of Time\\").  It's wonderful--especially for someone like me who has followed SF since the 1950s--to have a writer of  Piercy's talent using SF as a medium.	1998-12-26

It has Hogan's usual faults (although I should qualify that by saying I'm still working on his older books)--pretty one-dimensional characters as interchangeable with each other as so many  cardboard dolls, and a tremendous amount of boring yahda-yahda which I  gather is hard science.  Even so, it is a tremendously gripping book.  No  wonder I was infuriated by all of the scientific babblespeak--who could  stand to wade through it to get to the end?  Obviously, some other readers  could.  I too had the thought that this book would make an excellent  movie--the great part about that is that then all of the intricate computer  science gobbledygook would disappear and the premise and characters would  come to the fore as they should. Apologies to those who really like this  sort of hard science, but I've read Kim Stanley Robinson and Stephen Baxter  and they know how to pack novels with hard science and still make them a  joy to read.  I'm still continuing to read Hogan, but the best SF is more  than just intricate details of advanced engineering ideas.  &quot;Two  Faces&quot; has a fascinating premise, a very suspenseful plot, and a  satisfying ending, and with those taken together, it's a worthwhile read.	1998-12-05

The future society Bear developed in &quot;Queen of  Angels&quot; and revisits here is rich and lushly described, and the  characters are well realized for the most part, but for me, the suspense  buildup was really spoiled by that 75 or so pages where not all that much  happens.	1998-11-25

Baxter creates well-drawn and interesting characters and sets them loose on an adventure of truly mind-boggling scale.  I haven't read any of his stuff before, but that's  gonna change, now!  &quot;Ring&quot; reminds me most of Kim Stanley  Robinson's &quot;Red Mars,&quot; which won a well-deserved Hugo Award. It's  positively bursting with well-thought-out and captivating speculation and  extrapolation, and most of the time I was reading, I just kept shaking my  head in amazement at the scope of the ideas.  You may learn more about  stellar physics or superstring theory than you'd like to, but hey, that's  hard SF, and Baxter does a good job of keeping the science understandable.  &quot;Ring&quot; occasionally drags a bit, but not for long, and I  guarantee it will expand your mental horizons.	1998-11-18

Unfortunately, I just finished rereading his &quot;Voyage from Yesteryear,&quot; which is vastly superior to this artificial intelligence tale.  &quot;Realtime Interrupt&quot; is for  techheads only, and those who love office and major-corporation politics.  Both are covered in mind-numbing detail, while personal interactions and  characterization get generally short shrift.  Will the protagonist's  cutting-edge AI project be shunted aside by corporate bigwigs in favor of a  rival formulation that is very similar, but focuses on a higher level of  the brain?  Will the protagonist wind up trapped in a dead-end career path  instead of making millions?  If these kinds of questions fascinate you,  you've come to the right place.  This book might have satisfied me in 1960,  but SF has moved on to a higher and better place since then.	1998-11-07

The plot of this book revolves around the protagonist's effort  to gather samples from a garden of unique plants during the brief reign of  Mary Queen of Scots.  Baker writes in a clear, accessible style and her  characters are well developed and memorable.  For a debut, this is a  remarkable performance that already ranks among the best of the time-travel  and alternate-universe novels, such as Poul Anderson's &quot;Guardians of  Time&quot; or Ward Moore's &quot;Bring the Jubilee.&quot;  Baker's  narrative holds the reader's attention, and makes the book both educational  and entertaining.

Russo mixes a cyberpunkish background with a detective story, and gets  something that is really not quite up to the best of either.  The plot of  this book needs tightening up--far too many pages pass with little or  nothing happening in the case that is the center of the novel.  And Russo  doesn't quite have the voice of the inner-city cop down--try any of  Lawrence Block's Matt Scudder mysteries to see a master of this genre at  work.  The premise here was interesting, and the narrative didn't flag, but  I found a fair amount of the writing and reactions of the characters to be  a little too predictable.	1998-10-30

Now, decades later, the New  American Order (which sounds pretty fascist) sends the first mission from  Earth to the new colony, only to find that its society is quite different  from Earth's, and in some surprising ways.  This is an excellent book,  featuring some very imaginative hard SF concepts and far-reaching social  commentary.  In essence, it amounts to a libertarian manifesto, but in some  ways Hogan goes farther than that.  I have doubts about how workable his  concept would be with a society numbering more than a few hundred thousand  souls, but it certainly sounds attractive.  Hogan's writing is expert, and  his ear for the voice of the military grunts who are the focus of much of  the book's action is unerring--kind of an interstellar MASH or Catch-22, if  you take my meaning.  This is one that I really didn't want to end.	1998-10-24

I found it disappointing.  The characters are not particularly well developed, the plot is  predictable, the battle sequences are vague and rather repetitive, and one  never really gets to find out much about where the characters come from or  why.  It's still readable, but falls far short of what I've read of Simak's  SF work.

For  fantasy enthusiasts (make that addicts) only, I'd say.	1998-10-23

Charles Darwin's grandfather Erasmus Darwin is the protagonist in this  collection of three separate stories.  In them, Erasmus uses deductive  reasoning and his powers of observation, a la Sherlock Holmes, to penetrate  three mysteries which at first blush appear to involve the supernatural.  At the same time, matters are not so simple, because Sheffield's backdrop  is a fantasy England where supernatural explanations cannot necessarily be  ruled out . . .  The first episode is not so great--Darwin comes off as  only slightly brighter than average.  But the episodes which follow are  engaging and interesting, well worth the read.  Sheffield is a skilled  practitioner who holds the reader's attention.  I enjoyed the book, but  wound up feeling slightly disappointed that Darwin, billed as  &quot;arguably the greatest Englishman of the 18th century,&quot; is not  even more witty and brilliant.	1998-10-14

As with the original &quot;Orbitsville,&quot; Bob Shaw  tries to tackle too much with this 251-page (fairly large print)  sequel--more on Orbitsville itself, scientific proof of life after death,  the structure of the universe, a space-opera-style riff on Orbitsville's  origin--and the result is somewhat of a mishmash and disappointment.  The  book's blurb talks about Orbitsville's origin being &quot;the ultimate  answer to [Dallen's] quest,&quot; but it's not really--this is just a book  about a resident of Orbitsville who had some interesting things happen to  him.

The first starship returns from a 40-year voyage to find Earth's society  completely changed.  The commander, a kind of genetic superman (but not  telepathic, as the Amazon capsule summary has it), hopes to seize power.  It's a society at once saner and more dangerous than our own--one where  private autos are banned, but a person can be enslaved instantly through  the use of drugs that can be applied to any paper or other surface that  comes into contact with the skin.  This is a remarkable and original book  from a stylish, talented author.  I've just finished Samuel Delany's  &quot;Triton,&quot; and &quot;Beloved Son&quot; is reminiscent of Delany's  style, though perhaps not quite so difficult--Turner conveys ideas in  shorthand, and makes the reader do a lot of thinking.  Why only 4 stars?  A  little too much shorthand for me, plus a tendency to shift the story's  viewpoint around among several characters, none of whom are particularly  likable.

The book's blurb compares it to &quot;Lord  of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Watership Down,&quot; and with those  comparisons I would generally agree.  I wasn't that enthused about it  because I prefer fantasies (and myths) with human characters instead of  animals and it suffers by comparison with Orson Scott Card's &quot;Worthing  Chronicle,&quot; a human myth that I read immediately prior.  The blurb  also says &quot;Dun Cow&quot; should be of interest to all age groups.

Nexialism undertakes to combine the knowledges of the  various branches of science and make something than is more than the sum of  the parts, and Van Vogt provides an extremely cleverly-drawn summary of how  this works under fire.  As with several of his other books, its insight  into social science is penetrating and original.  The only minor drawback  is the relatively two-dimensional characters, a feature quite common in  older SF.  But Van Vogt keeps the action coming and the narrative direct  and absorbing.

I'm very disappointed in this book.  Judging from the title and from  recommendations I had heard from others, I was looking forward to a  thoughtful, insightful critique of the problems of our society, of which I  agree there are many.  Unfortunately, this book is not that critique.  All  too often, Glendinning's thinking is sloppy and her language over-the-top.  The sloppy thinking is exemplified by her failure to distinguish between  &quot;Western civilization,&quot; which is excoriated at every turn, and  domestication of animals, which turns out to be the root of all evil and  which took place long before Western civilization was launched.  Another  example: Glendinning cites statistics to the effect that in 1900 in the  U.S., only one person in 33 died of cancer, whereas today the number is one  in three. This is true as far as it goes, but it omits the rather  well-known response--a higher percentage of people die from cancer today  because medicine has dramatically reduced fatalities from other diseases  such as smallpox and diphtheria. According to Glendinning's thesis,  virtually every negative human behavior--including rape, child abuse, war,  ethnic cleansing, violence on TV, the manufacturing of toxic chemicals, and  many more--stems from the building of the first fence. If you like  extremely simple answers and guilt-tripping, this book is for you.  If  you're looking for a carefully thought-out discussion of the problems our  society faces and ideas on how they might be addressed, look elsewhere.	1998-08-23

This is the  story of a mutant, Lord Clane, of noble birth, but with a body warped by  radiation, and his efforts to raise society to a higher plane.  The  characters are mostly flat, but Van Vogt ladles out the imaginative  concepts as skilfully as ever, and never fails to hold the reader.	1998-08-23

The  protagonist, a newspaper reporter, puts a series of clues together and then  faces the expectable problem of convincing others that he is not a lunatic  and that his fears are real.  Light summer fare, a bit dated but still  enjoyable--I don't think Simak was capable of writing a bad book.	1998-08-23

This book seems to me like an allegory about Life, as exemplified by the phenomenon that Radio was in its early days. Wonderful humor--Keillor's ear for Midwestern culture is as usual razor-sharp--wonderful stories, and the inevitable sadness at the limits that constrain us all.  Lots of sex and dirty jokes, though not all that different from what I remember as a child growing up in Ohio.  Many interesting cultural insights as well.  I enjoyed this book immensely.	1998-06-23

This is a highly readable tale of one of the Roman soldiers who crucified Christ, and won Christ's robe as a gambling prize.  Its main weaknesses are that the plotting is only fair (a little too much time spent journeying through Galilee), and the characters are not as convincingly drawn as one might like.  I'd give it 3 stars, except that there is a depth in its philosophy that makes you stop and think.  I don't agree with Douglas about everything, but I think he comes close to capturing the essence of what Christianity was all about before it became codified and encrusted with ritual and windy sermonizing, and why it was such a revolutionary idea.  It still IS a revolutionary idea, in this age of free markets, &quot;economic man,&quot; and unabashed greed.  This book has made me think about trying to apply its principles in my everyday life, and very few books achieve that.	1998-06-23

It is basically a novelization of the life of the Apostle Paul, with considerable, and skillful, embroidering of the numerous settings in the Ancient World to which he traveled in the course of his ministry.  THE APOSTLE is most suited, I think, for fervent Christians.  Others may find it overly preachy, since it frequently repeats the author's theories about the superiority of Christianity over pagan religions and about the motivations of St. Paul.  I personally found it long-winded and draggy.  It took me the better part of a month to wade through, whereas I have finished about half of THE ROBE, another novel of the same period, in a single day.  Even so, THE APOSTLE does contain a great deal of interesting detail about the philosophical debates that consumed the early Christians, and about some of the primary characters involved in those debates.	1998-06-14
US	52814113	R2KDATY9WSE4IM	0345287703	489309233	The Revolving Boy	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Original SF, written with a sure hand.	The protagonist of this book, Derv Nagy, has an apparent physical disability that causes him to be--well--different, but in the end becomes an element in a highly original science fiction novel.  Gertrude Friedberg's writing style is simple and unadorned in the extreme, which appeals to me, as I am generally not fond of writing that is so stylish that it distracts one's attention from the narrative.  That is no problem here.  Should be interesting and understandable to readers from around age 10 on up.  I've read a great deal of science fiction, and this one stands out as one of the most unique.	1998-04-11
