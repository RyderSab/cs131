This book brought a turnabout to my thinking about healing and health and prayer. A friend gave the book to me  after a long conversation about prayer and the television preachers who wave their hands and magically heal  people. I still don't think much of those charlatans on television, but the  book by Norberg and Webber talks about healing in a variety of ways, the  least as physical. They write about emotional and spiritual and relational  healing, something God knows that we need. They write a chapter that seemed  to come from the Sixties, but seems appropriate today, about healing  institutions--exorcising them of the evil powers they have. (Reminded me of  a protest during Vietnam when the Pentagon was exorcised. But that's not  part of this book.) This book is fully based on the Bible. The authors  explore texts to help us understand the biblical world as well as the  contemporary one and the way healing was understood then and can be  understood today. A fine book!	1999-07-05

She understands how spirituality connects with social action. I haven't heard a lot about that connection--thought maybe it died with the movements of the  '60s. Maybe it didn't die, but has been hiding in the church all these  years. Reading this book encourages me to think positively about church and  community and possibilities for justice.	1999-07-01

Imagine decision-making based on an  understanding of spirituality instead of legalisms! Morris and Olsen offer  such a practice through their discernment process. (They get a little cute  as they explore the process and coin words based on discernment, but that  can be excused.)  This is a fine book. It allows those who feel intimidated  by the rules of parliamentary proceduce to move beyond that and offers the  timid fresh ways to act on their convictions. <br />The book has a helpful  chart that shows the step-by-step  process of moving toward discernment. I  found the illustrations helpful and the cover art connects  with the  ancient tradition of the church and  represents a sense of  listening for  God.	1999-07-01

Other Bibles I've read have either been study Bibles or Bibles with  devotional messages tucked into the chapters. This Bible offers ways to  meet God through the text, by listening to the text, by letting the text  meet the human situation. Commendations to the team behind this book!	1999-06-28

Many churches  struggle with a sense of purpose, of mission, of reason behind the  community. Hollyday's work would provide churches with a basis to  understand their external actions if they would study her book. She speaks  a prophetic word, which we should hear.	1999-06-28

It talks about faith and spiritual resources in order to live in the aftermath of the disasters that happen. That simply happen. No one's fault. Just there. I've lived through tornadoes,  hurricanes, divorce, deaths. Enough to ask the &quot;Why&quot; question,  but that seemed like the stuff of a never-ending  all-night conversation .  This book  assumes that the horrors happen and then it helps people receive  the spiritual resources to live through the tragedies. That may sound easy,  but the author is not a fundamentalist with pat and trite answers. Clapper  shows his intelligence  by insisting that we accept the Mystery--not  passively quitting, but actively accepting and living with Mystery. That is  not an answer  I've seen very many church preachers give, but the author  builds well on this premise.	1999-06-15

By healing he means forgiveness. THis book accompanies a comprehensive  work, but Clinebell offers here a number  of tips and guideliness that are unavailable elsewhere. The FAQ section is  like attending a seminar. Retreat and study models are also included.  This  book makes congregational outreach far more real because it is easy to  establish a variety of relational groups.  And Clinebell is comfortable  dealing with the fundamentalists who  do not share his vision--he may help  these people grow.	1999-06-14

Gerrit Dawson writes incredible stories about exile and restoration that  made me feel as if I were there, as if I were the one in the middle of that  exile, and somehow the history became real and became my history. Even  better than that was the fact that becoming a part of the story helped me  become more open to God, letting my life be a part of God's love.	1999-06-09

One  does not think (normally) of a house as forbidding; rather, a house is a  place that extends love and caring. So Clapper offers the Wesleyan image of  the house of religion as a place where love and caring are inherent. Such  hospitality comes from the heart of spiritual practice. <br />A good  small-group study.	1999-05-31

It deals with divorce and the church, and it deals very honestly with the Bible and with the personal experience. Redding looks not only at her divorce, but her marriage. She addresses spiritual  issues that the church seems to have preferred to ignore. She writes from a  thorough knowledge of the Bible as well as her own experience. <br />The  subtitle (Divorce and God's Grace) offers much insight into the author's  perspective. Redding is convinced that God loves human beings and that love  extends beyond and through the tragedies of our institutions and  relationships.  She emphasizes God's grace and love above all. Redding  deals with forgiveness and family, healing and broken dreams. <br />This is a  book unlike any other divorce book on the market because Redding deals  honestly and seriously with divorce (unlike so many books from a religious  perspective  that simply say &quot;don't do it&quot;)  and she offers a  biblical foundation for her story. This is a book every pastor should read  and have available for those who seek counsel.	1999-05-31

I wanted his insights and daily readings to continue beyond Easter. Here it is fifty days later and I still miss the book. I hope the author will publish other  materials.<br />Indermark's writing  combines biblical stories (readings each  day in Genesis) with a commentary that ranges from biblical practice to a  very contemporary visit to Auschwitz.

He unpacks some general principles that relate specifically to a  Christian context and yet, his findings offer much to individuals who are  not engaged in the institution of church: What community is there that  cannot extend hospitality? What community cannot learn more about  hospitality? What community does not face blockages in its ongoing life?  These are some of the questions Doughty faces. He prods and pushes and  gently shows us questions that guide our spiritual quest.<br />The author  includes meditative exercises and questions for group conversation. These  seem to be quite helpful!	1999-05-18

Clinebell shakes up a lot of wholeness arguments by writing about the  environment as well as about people. He is convinced that individuals do  not receive healing or wholeness unless the earth is healed. He writes  about pollution and the effects of lifestyle on the earth--the consequences  of national political decisions and individual actions. <br />In a w ay this  is a Bible for health and wholeness.	1999-05-17

(And I live in a heavily industrialized section of Virginia, a town once known for its chemical  &quot;accidents.&quot;)  I think Joyce Hollyday's book is a manifesto for  spirituality and social witness in our time in the same way that Dorothy  Day spoke to the culture of her time. Hollyday offers insights that connect  social action with spirituality. She does it without condemnation, but with  a spirit of gentleness, something missing from many books that deal with  the problems of society.	1999-05-17

Kathleen Fischer deals with a variety of topics concerning aging, and she most effectively relates these topics  to the larger and more holistic life-issue of spirituality. Some of the  topics include sexuality and sex, the deaths of friends, the passing of  wisdom on to the next generation. Fischer offers insights into deepening  one's own spiritual life, and she helps the reader understand the  importance of deepening this relationship.<br />Winter Grace is an  easy-to-read, yet thought-provocking book.  As a baby boomer, I appreciate  her wisdom and have sent this book to boomer friends.	1999-05-17

Rice taught spiritual formation for a number of years and attempts to put his thought into a systems approach to congregational ministry. In  many ways he succeeds, particularly as he deals with the everyday actions  of pastors and the normal problems of churches. Where Rice slips is in the  biblical foundation for his approach. I wanted Rice to use the Bible, to  show a biblical basis for his work, to develop especially that biblical  foundation for pastoral authority. That is not there, though any pastor  should be able to read this book and grow from its insights. And any pastor  can provide the biblical texts he or she most often quotes concerning call  to ministry. I am not aware of any other contemporary attempts to relate  spiritual guidance to the totality of ministry. Do read the book. Maybe the  sequel is in you and awaits birth.	1999-05-17

Rutter writes about a ministry rooted in contemplative prayer. It is a  strangely modern and ancient practice, one that does not fit our planning  calendars. Yet contemporary writers such as Henri Nouwen speak of being  judged not by our activities, but by our prayers. Ancient pastors,  sometimes known as shepherds, sometimes known for caring for souls, spent  hours each day and perhaps whole days each week in prayer. Surely those  prayers included thanksgiving and petititon and intercession, but those  prayers must also have included contemplation--sitting in silence and  listening for God.<br />As a pastor, I feel the pressure to perform, to be  everywhere and do more than seems possible. I do this in a way that  exhausts me. I know that I can spend some time daily in the prayer that  Rutter describes. I know that when I practice this contemplative prayer, my  ministry feels more real. But the temptations to not pray in such a way are  many. And most of those temptations are in my calendar! <br />Read this book  and then be gentle with yourself.	1999-05-17

This is Dawson's concern in Called By A New Name.  He considers the effect of alienation on contemporary society, something we  need not look far to see, and connects that alienation with the terrible  Babylonian Exile of the Hebrew people, a move that uprooted their society  and their theological underpinnings--their very relationship with God.  Dawson examines the work of the prophet Isaiah in speaking to these  alienated exiles. The word concerns healing  and restoration and hope.  Dawson elevates these concerns in an ancient culture to connect with our  very modern societal disease. <br />After the school shootings, Dawson's voice  is one we need listen to.	1999-05-17

We enjoyed Willimon's wit and shared some of his opinions. He made us think. <br />I disagree with his interpretation of John Updike's book. In the Beauty of the Lilies is  not about spiritual sloth! It deals with institutionalism in the church and  the failings of family, particularly as shaped by the 20th century's media.  I suppose Dr. Willimon and I might debate that issue.<br />On the other hand,  I felt good to see references to The Odyssey and felt even better to meet a  new author in Willimon's work. After reading Willimon, I found Ron Hansen's  Mariette in Ecstasy. It is even more awesome, wondrous, and mystical than  Willimon described it! Thanks for the book!	1999-05-17

Gregory Clapper was an Air National Guard chaplain in Iowa when United Airlines flight 232 crashed. Over one-hundred people. Clapper ministered to the families of the victims, those who survived, and even members of the  various National Guard and governmental agencies involved in sifting the  wreckage.<br />His book is not a thrill-seeking  story. It is a thoughtful  spiritual  reflection on the crash. Clapper examines small interactions   and  relationships . In these reflections Clapper offers six resources for  living with tragedy, something which we cannot escape. His resources range  from embracing the essential mystery  of life to releasing the tears to  living with hope. This evocative book brings forth tears and joy and a  sense of God's reign in the midst of imperfection.<br />Considering the  numbers of tragic events (e.g., ethnic cleansing, high school and grade  school shootings, natural disasters), this engrossing book is a must read.	1999-05-12

This type of prayer works well for small groups--I am using it in a weekly gathering of adults and we find the  process one that opens us to God.  I have also used the process with a  group of youth who responded passionately to this process.<br />Vest's work is  very helpful. Not only does she describe the approach, but she tells  the  stories of a small prayer  group that tries this approach to illustrate  more deeply the process. <br />This is a great resource for small groups and  for individuals who want to learn a new way of praying.	1999-03-09

This despite the  fact that some of us have &quot;known&quot; others in the group for twenty  or more years! We learned far more about the influences of family and  church and community, of music teachers and janitors, and people who shaped  our lives. Morgan's approach allowed us the space to share intimately  without embarrassment. The book did a very good job of helping us connect  with the biblical stories of people on the spiritual journey. We also  appreciated the leader's guide. Very helpful process.	1999-02-02

The seven dimensions discussed are spiritual, physical, emotional, relational, work &amp; play, crisis &amp;  loss, and environmental well being. <br />The book has a simple design:  Each  chapter opens with a series of statements designed to allow the reader to  assess his or her health in the given dimension of well being.  Then  Clinebell delves into the content with the passion of a lecturer in demand.   <br />Clinebell begins with spiritual well being and offers a number of  insights based on biblical texts and reflections. Clinebell's various  exercises in the seven dimensions allow readers to practice his insights.  The &quot;Baker's Dozen Suggestions for Relational Well Being&quot; are of  primo importance. Perhaps most radical statement is Clinebell's contention  that personal wholeness cannot be achieved until environmental  wholeness/justice becomes real. <br />Howard Clinebell is a United Methodist  minister and a professor of pastoral care. He lectures around the world. I  gained a sense of his lecture style by reading this book and found the work  practical and practiceable.	1999-01-04

Willimon traces the spiritual journey by looking at ten literary works. He begins with the image of the  spiritual  quest from the Odyssey, takes us into some of the despair voiced by  characters in the work of Flannery O'Connor and Walker Percy, moves us into  the possibilities offered by Anne Tyler in Saint Maybe, and ends with a  gifted reading of Mariette in Ecstasy, an overlooked novel by Ron Hansen.  It is a pilgrim's progress traced through some surprising literary works.  <br />Willimon makes the salient point that God pops up in literature  sometimes to the surprise of an author and perhaps even despite the author.  He also offers a crusty opinion of &quot;Christian fiction.&quot;<br />After  reading the book and enjoying Willimon's references and summaries of the  work s discussed, I  found myself wanting to read or reread the original  works. <br />I think this will be an excellent book for groups that want to  unpack literature or who want to read the literature from a different  perspective. I imagine that even church and  Sunday school groups will find  Willimon's work quite helpful.	1998-12-09
