The solution to the mystery plot, which centers around Spenser's client's involvement or non-involvement in the shooting, has another \\"ripped from the headlines\\" true-life inspiration, though I won't say which one because I don't want to give away the eventual plot and character revelations.<br /><br />I'll just report, then, that this was a better-than-average installment among recent Spenser novels and it was refreshing that it was JUST a Spenser novel:  It wasn't about Hawk or Susan or Vinnie or anybody else.  Don't get me wrong, the supporting cast in this series is great. But maybe every five books or so we should get a story just like this one, with Spenser trudging through the woods in the rain looking for clues and alone with his thoughts.	2005-10-13

The reader, of course, wonders how said mystery and crisis ties into the opening scenes of the book, which were set several months earlier.  This wondering keeps us reading, even though there are some tedious emotions on display: homicide detective Jane Rizzoli's FBI agent husband Gabriel endlessly displays realistic but extremely predictable (and ultimately tiresome) demonstrations of concern over the fate of his wife, who is one of the hostages.  The last section of the book, set in some lonely woods after the hostage crisis has played out, really pick up, however; they're tension-packed, laced with danger, and keep one turning the pages.  The closing pages also finally do something interesting with the Rizzoli/Gabriel dynamic, as our stalwart FBI agent lets us know that he, too, has had enough of his endless concern about his wife's dangerous job, and may want off of the merry-go-round!  But final answers on this issue will have to wait for the next entry in this series, which this book will ultimately make you want to seek out.	2005-10-06
US	52966690	RVW91DNBYUA3P	0743466721	621780752	Assassin	Books	3	9	10	N	N	Alex Hawke jumps into the fray again	The second Alexander Hawke novel isn't quite as engaging as the series debut novel, \\"Hawke\\", mostly due to Alex Hawke taking a back seat a little too often to his supporting characters, who are given extended missions of their own.  Also, speaking of \\"extended\\", the villain's extensive backstory also eats up a lot of pages.  Finally (mild spoiler here), the novel begins on a really downer note, as a likable character from the first book meets a bad end in the novel's opening pages.<br /><br />But with all that said, there are still enough good scenes with Alex, enough entertaining banter between Alex and his buddies, and a satisfying over-the-top final showdown (involving sumo wrestlers, no less) in the villain's lair.  I also liked the decidedly non-over-the-top extra bonus showdown, where the President and U.S. military have to deal with a rogue jetliner trying to deliver a very big threat into the U.S.  Here, Ted Bell courageously allowed the \\"good guys\\" to essentially play dirty pool and arguably act quite dishonorably to stop this final threat by the villain.  It showed that war is indeed hell and that sometimes heroes have to act as cold as their adversaries to get the job done.<br /><br />Though I ultimately liked \\"Hawke\\" more than this outing because there was less technology and more humanity, I nonetheless still enjoyed \\"Assassin\\" and look forward to seeing what Ted Bell does in the third book of this series, \\"Pirate\\".	2005-09-28

There's also some genuine emotional resonance, as Alex Hawke slowly confronts his childhood demons.  Also, I didn't mind some of the more outlandish plot elements, as they reminded me of the kind of thing Ian Fleming always did: drop a colorful, comic-book style villain and his over-the-top caper into an otherwise real-world setting.  It worked well then and it works well now.	2005-09-20

Konrath's \\"Bloody Mary\\" is even better.  The first novel was terrific not so much because it broke new ground, but because it took the conventions we expect to see in a police/serial killer thriller and gave us extremely intense and memorable takes on those conventions. For example, the serial killer's actions were especially horrific and the banter between the cops was especially funny and entertaining.  Here, Konrath again does a great job giving us refreshing and memorable versions of the conventions we expect to see in a serial killer thriller, but then adds a little bonus in the form of an unconventional plot structure.  Warning, mild spoilers to follow... In \\"Bloody Mary\\", you see, the killer is identified and captured halfway into the book.  But the story is nowhere near over and some very interesting things happen in the novel's second half.  So, you get what readers like to see in this kind of book, then you get some surprises, too.  Way to go, J.A.  I'm on board for the next entry in this series, \\"Rusty Nail\\", which I hear is coming out in mid-2006.	2005-09-02

So I was quite surprised that, in addition to getting all those things, I also got an extremely well crafted, excellently directed film with great performances and complex things to say about guns, the American dream, child psychology, and gender roles.  It was a great film.  So, I wasn't surprised to later see that the British Film Institute produced one of its thin BFI Classics volumes about \\"Gun Crazy\\".  Written by film scholar Jim Kitsis, this is a great examination of the movie and very entertaining to read.  I particularly liked the 5-page or so postscript, which describes the author's visit to the home of Peggy Cummins, the female lead in the film, in 1995.  Ms. Cummins shares lots of great stories about the film with the author, as well as her reactions to the author's opinions about the film.  A highly recommended little book for those who enjoyed \\"Gun Crazy\\".	2005-07-26

A young couple (do we still use the term \\"yuppies\\" these days?) travel to Colombia to adopt a child, but things get complicated when child and new mother are kidnapped by drug dealers funding local revolutionary efforts.  Insurance actuary Paul Breidbart must rise to the occasion to get his new family back, as well as contend with his forced servitude as a drug courier for the kidnappers.  \\"Detour\\" is a bit too busy at times, but it's laced with engaging characters and the story always remains at least moderately involving.  Be warned, though: about halfway into the story there's a heck of a torture scene that's definitely not for the squeamish.	2005-07-21

After all, a light, breezy, engaging mystery story isn't easy to produce, even if the author makes it LOOK easy.  And this story, like the earlier one I read, is a light, breezy, engaging mystery story that I easily recommend.<br /><br />Three plotlines quickly move along in the story's 252 pages (I read the paperback edition): a mystery story involving a dead woman found in a local bigwig's basement; the dramatic escalation of the Cuban missile crisis, which serves as the story's backdrop; and the romantic trials and tribulations of investigator and lead character Sam McCain.  Mr. Gorman skillfully bounces between these various story elements, and also effectively intertwines them.<br /><br />I also liked how, despite the story's 1962 setting, the author doesn't hit us over the head with dense details of the period, and endless observations of that time. Too much of that sort of thing often severely slows down the pacing of period thrillers, but that doesn't happen here.  Mr. Gorman keeps the story front and center, and the period stuff secondary.  For, while there's certainly a place for period mysteries that go on for 500 pages and also function as historical documents of the period (Caleb Carr's \\"The Alienist\\" and James Ellroy's \\"L.A. Confidential\\" spring to mind here), it's also nice to have a period mystery series that strives to deliver a light, fast read, too.<br /><br />As of this writing, there are six mysteries in the Sam McCain series, and I've read the last two.  I definitely plan to seek out the first four book in this series, and hope he writes more.	2005-07-13

I won't reveal too much in this review, but here the entire story is told by a character who, in addition to emotionally and sexually abusing his wife on a regular basis, may be responsible for one murder or several murders.<br /><br />This is one of those stories told entirely from the perspective of one character, a character whose narration may not be entirely trustworthy.  Actually, to be more accurate, the author's story is more subtle and skillful than that: the narrator is actually entirely trustworthy, but one has to read very closely and, more importantly, in between the lines to get the whole story the narrator is telling us.<br /><br />Still, you have to be able to get into a good, grim crime story involving dark obsessions or you probably won't enjoy this novel very much.  I can take stories like this occasionally, but after reading \\"The Confession\\", I'm ready for a regular run-of-the-mill mystery featuring a wise-cracking detective trying to solve a routine murder case.<br /><br />But, make no mistake, if you're in the mood for this sort of thing, Mr. Stansberry is the real deal.  I'll definitely read something of his again... after I take a bit of a break after reading this story.	2005-07-01

The characters and situations can be taken on their own terms as exciting story elements, but also as metaphors for old time America making way, for better or worse, for a new America.<br /><br />It is also very interesting to see Mr. Parker put a new spin on his frequent theme of personal codes and how they make the man: namely, it examines what can happen when a violent but law-abiding sheriff (a guy who is an expert killer but who will kill only when the law says it is okay for him to do so), goes head to head with a rich sociopath who is able to buy the law and make it work to his own advantage.<br /><br />In the end, one character makes a decision and a sacrifice that allows the old ways to go on a little longer, but it's clear that the victory is a temporary one, and that the slow encroachment of new America- a place of many comforts and benefits, but also a place where wealth often speaks louder than justice- was only temporarily slowed down.<br /><br />Like \\"Gunman's Rhapsody\\" (another western) and \\"Double Play\\", this is another of the occasional novels Mr. Parker writes that do not feature any of his popular continuing detective characters.  And like all Mr. Parker's novels- the ones that feature continuing characters and the ones that don't- this one is well worth your time.	2005-06-28
US	52966690	R1RPDJK6386MRJ	1416509801	942415879	Fantastic Four	Books	2	7	8	N	N	Based on this book, film might not be all that fantastic	These days I don't often read tie-in novelizations of upcoming films, preferring to wait and experience the actual movie, which most would agree is probably the best way to discover a story designed for the screen.  But novelizations can often be fun, and this one was written by the talented comic book writer Peter David (who adapted the film script written by three other folks), so I figured I'd give it a whirl.<br /><br />  Sadly, if the movie sticks close to the story in this paperback, it will end up being a wasted opportunity to bring something great to the screen.  In the comments that follow, I'll discuss this book, but I'm really talking about the movie on which the book is based.<br /><br />  Overall, Mr. David does his best to make the story work in book form, toning down idiotic sight gags (yes, Reed Richards gets kicked in a sensitive place by Ben Grimm when Reed tests Ben's reflexes with a little hammer blow to Ben's newly-rocky knee), but in the end two adjectives come to mind to describe this story: silly and thin.<br /><br />  What's depressing is that this is the Fantastic Four, the title that established Marvel Comics' famous formula of heroics combined with melodrama, where the heroes can save the world one issue but not be able to make its lease payment on their headquarters the next.  Where wonderment and imagination permeated every issue of the original FF comic book no matter the personal dilemmas taking place.  Other movies should be looking in reverence to the Fantastic Four movie to see how a super-hero movie should be done.  Sadly, though, it's probably a good idea that other films don't emulate this one.  Because this Fantastic Four movie, based on what's in this novel, doesn't trust its own pedigree, and instead cynically includes touchstones from our \\"popular\\" culture to make the story more \\"approachable\\".<br /><br />  It's not amazing enough that Johnny Storm can burst into flames and roar through the skies.  No, we better have him first discover his powers while snowboarding with a hot nurse, catching fire while gaining speed on his board.  Then, the next time he displays his powers, it's while participating in an X-Games/Extreme sports tournament, bursting into flames while doing stunts on a cycle.  I can almost hear the story conference: \\"What do the kids like these days?  I got it, snowboarding and all that Extreme sports stuff.  Let's work that in somehow.\\"  Since when does the FF need the latest hip & trendy gimmicks to sell what they're all about?  Did the X-Men movie need to do this?  Did Spidey?  Why did the producers feel the need to \\"help\\" the FF this way?<br /><br />The Dr. Doom stuff is okay, but just so, well... thin.  Doom is nothing at all like the classic villain in the FF comics.  Here, he's just a guy who's mad at Reed Richards for frustrating his attempts to make money from the cosmic storm experiment, and for wooing Sue away from him.  These are believable motivations, but not very interesting ones.  And having Doom slowly turning into a being of metal, ala the X-Men's Colossus, was a needless change.  Doom's \\"superpower\\" was always his intellect.  Insane intellect, but intellect.  And why NOT keep him as the monarch of the fictional Balkan country of Latveria?  There are tons of examples of male monarchs in recent history (Prince Rainier, for one), monarchs who studied in the U.S. during their formative years and could have met a Reed Richards type and established an uneasy friendship.  Then Reed could have went to his friend- now a monarch in Europe- and asked for funding for the cosmic ray experiment. But here Doom is just a boring Donald Trump type, with a little scientific knowledge.  Hey, I know super-hero movies need to make some changes from the original comics source material, but why take out great, entertaining aspects of the original material and replace them with watered-down stuff?<br /><br />I could go on and on, but I'll just make one or two more quick observations: Picturing Jessica Alba as I read this novelization, I began to feel that she is much too glamourous for the role of Sue Storm.  I have no problem with her being in the movie, but she would have been better off as one of Johnny's girlfriends.  Or better yet, as Alicia Masters.  Wouldn't that be a kick... the monstrous Thing's girlfriend geing hotter than any of the women following Johnny around?  It would add an interesting subtext to Ben's and Johnny's friendship, his secret jealousy of Ben's girlfriend.  But, no, they went for a much simpler and less interesting idea: let's make Sue really hot.<br /><br />To end on a positive note, there's a pretty good battle at the end in the streets of New York (though it doesn't really do anything new), and, earlier, a nice scene in a planetarium between Reed and Sue, as they begin to reach out to one another.  And, without revealing too much, the producers leave things open for the return of Dr. Doom in a sequel, a Dr. Doom much closer to the conception of the character in the comics.  We'll see.<br /><br />But, in the end, and just from reading the novelization, I'd give the story a C/C- (readable but nothing special) and the characterizations a B/B+.  And, who knows, if they don't junk up the movie with too much rock music, and the Extreme sports stuff doesn't take center stage TOO much, we may still have a watchable movie that will permit the production of a better sequel.<br /><br />Oh, one final thought: none of the criticisms mentioned above are Peter David's fault.  He didn't write the movie, only this novelization of it.  He remains an entertaining writer who did his best here, though one gets the feeling he wrote some scenes through gritted teeth, and refused to fully embrace those scenes containing especially heavy doses of dumb-ness.  But I don't think anyone will hold that against him.  After all, most people agree with the old saying that says (paraphrased in a less vulgar way here) there are certain things that simply can't be polished.one or two more quick observations: Picturing Jessica Alba as I read this novelization, I began to feel that she is much too glamourous for the role of Sue Storm.

In this case, we're presented with a story about an already broken family (broken via divorce some years before) having to deal with an additional crisis: the sudden death via automobile accident of the family's new father figure.  The different family figures deal with the crisis in different ways.  Yes, one of the young daughters in the family eventually falls into a sensual relationship with a much older man, but those with prurient motivations for picking up this book should be forewarned: though there's one fairly graphic chapter, the whole scenario is treated intelligently and thoughtfully, not as softcore entertainment.  Also, that particular plotline is only one of many narrative lines developed by the author:  many of the characters, not just the one daughter, are \\"lost in the forest\\" in this novel, and we spend a lot of time dealing with their particular issues, too.  This is a fast, though thoughtful and subtle, reading experience, with characters you really get to know.  Recommended.	2005-05-23

Most of these angles involve human characters we've come to like being converted into human/water or human/wood hybrids by the elemental races whose war this series is slowly but surely turning its attention toward emphasizing.  As there isn't much scientific justification for how these mutations can take place, the series is starting to feel a little more like fantasy rather than science fiction, but that's okay.  Story and characters are still compelling, and I still want to see how it all turns out.  And, ultimately, that's what a series like this is all about, isn't it?	2005-05-13

Basically it's a prose re-telling of Jon Sable's origin story from the comics.<br /><br />A quick aside: If I remember correctly, the first two issues of the comic book contained single-issue stories showing Jon Sable taking on cases in New York, and issues 3 to 6 revealed how he became the adventurer, soldier of fortune, and righter of wrongs depicted in those first two issues.  Then, issue number 7 onward once again told present-day stories of our hero in action.  Sable the novel recounts the Africa-based origin story from issues 3-6 of the comics series, only with lots more details, as well as a lot of new material set in present day New York, mostly involving Sable's second job as a writer of children's books!<br /><br />The Jon Sable series was always good fun and a little more compelling than similar characters out there because he is both ruthless and a down-to-earth, likable guy (trained killer, writer of children's books... you gotta love that).  His supporting cast is also likable and quirky, not types you would expect to surround a soldier of fortune type.  This dual nature, always a part of the Jon Sable comics stories, is also fully and effectively on display in the novel.  The book also gives you lots of interesting discourse about the African political situation (Jon Sable made his living conducting safaris and stopping poachers before his soldier-of-fortune days), discourse only briefly touched on in the comics.<br /><br />Sable creator Mike Grell probably wrote the novel to create traction for a Jon Sable movie, as evidenced by the cover blurb \\"soon to be a major motion picture\\", but that movie never materialized (though I think there was a brief TV series).  That said, this unusual, offbeat novel-- like the comics, it's violent, yet often funny- is worth your time.<br /><br />And if you like it, it's pretty easy to find trade paperback collections of the original \\"Jon Sable, Freelance\\" comic books, and the 2005 Jon Sable comic book mini-series, \\"Bloodline\\".  The new mini-series, in fact, actually uses a lot of the new material that first appeared in this novel.<br /><br />This review has probably gone on a bit too long for an out-of-print paperback, but the book is still fairly easy to obtain in used book stores and via Amazon's used book network, so I thought I'd take a few minutes to tell you about it.your time. <br /> <br />And if you like it, it's pretty easy to find trade paperback collections of the original \\"Jon Sable, Freelance\\" comic books, and the 2005 Jon Sable comic book mini-series, \\"Bloodline\\".

These dark developments are mostly there to illustrate Anderson's continuing fascination with the theme of means versus ends: that is, is it permissable to engage in horrific exploitation and experimentation if those are the only methods to develop effective countermeasures against an even-more-horrific enemy?  I think most of us would answer \\"no\\" to that question, and I think Anderson would, too, but it is quite interesting to see how his characters, especially those in power, develop their own responses to such situations and moral dilemmas.  In addition, the stellar war initiated in book one develops in some unexpected ways in this second volume, as more parties enter the fray.

This is mainly due to the fact that we at least get to see a few unusual EVENTS happen, events Mr. Parker hasn't done a hundred times before.  These include Hawk getting seriously (almost mortally) wounded and needing Spenser's help to rehabilitate; and, later, Spenser and Hawk attempting to overthrow an entire small city.<br /><br />Interestingly, Hawk being Hawk, he rehabilitates and gets back on his feet MUCH faster than Spenser did when he received similar injuries back in \\"Small Vices.\\"  Hawk is more of a force of nature than a person, after all, so I found this development to be quite appropriate.<br /><br />Fans of \\"Small Vices\\" should also be aware that the villain from that piece, the enigmatic and scary hitman/international operative known as The Gray Man, finally returns to the world of Spenser in this novel.  But he returns as an ally of Spenser, not as an antagonist.  I guess that on one level this is more interesting than a simple repeat appearance as the villain, but this may be one case where doing the more expected thing- giving Spenser a rematch with the only guy who ever really scared him- would have been more satisfying than doing the unexpected thing by making him part of Spenser's team.  The Gray Man is still used in a sort of interesting and entertaining way here, however, so I won't complain too much.<br /><br />I'd still like to see some major shake-ups and developments, character-wise and plot-wise, from this series, in order to freshen it up and return us to a time when we didn't immediately know EXACTLY what we were getting when we picked up the latest \\"Spenser\\", but until this happens, each new \\"Spenser\\" still remains both highly readable and highly entertaining.  One could certainly do worse.ertainly do worse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-04-14

But be warned: the book involves a sexual crime that warrants a fair amount of frank discussion and investigations of several seedy and/or perverse characters.  The police characters, however, are competent and likable, and provide a nice grounding for the often unpleasant proceedings.  If you enjoy smart mysteries, you shouldn't hesitate spending a few hours with this entertaining paperback.	2005-03-23

That novel had the same strengths and weaknesses of this one:  there were lots of great details that fleshed out ideas only suggested in the original story, but the new story lacked an interesting, involving narrative.  In this particular case, \\"Labyrinth of Evil\\" sheds a little light on some of the behind-the-scenes stuff only suggested or barely mentioned in the prequels, and there's a nice sense of place when the author describes the planet Coruscant and its various districts, institutions, and culture.  But it really isn't all that successful as a well-crafted novel.  It's basically one big action scene after another, with small breaks where the Jedi comment on that action.  Getting a sneak peak at General Grievous (a major new character in \\"Revenge of the Sith\\") was interesting, but characters like Padme, Mace Windu, Dooku, and Yoda are either under-utilized or used in not very interesting ways.  I know that major revelations, answers, closure, etc. are being saved for the new film, but I think the author could have set the stage for that film in a much more dramatic fashion than just bouncing the characters around from action scene to action scene like metal balls in a pinball machine.  Borrow this, or wait for the paperback.	2005-03-17
US	52966690	R284D7B9JF4DTX	0892967986	890215223	Nobody Runs Forever	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Nothing like a bank job to distract you from life's stresses	Longtime readers of this excellent crime series know two things: 1) the author aggressively avoids debating the moral issues related to his crook protagonists' activities, and just worries about telling a good story, and 2) in the end sometimes the featured caper or \\"job\\" works out, sometimes it doesn't, and (as is most often the case) aspects of the job work out while other aspects don't.  This time, the main \\"fly in the ointment\\" is increased security.  In the wake of September 11 and the overall war on terror, every institution in the U.S. (banks, hotels, airlines, law enforcement, etc., etc.) is so much better and so much more conscious of security and surveillance issues that your regular, garden-variety, non-terrorist crook is really finding it hard to make a living.  So, the bank job depicted here- which wouldn't have been exactly easy before- is really a challenge in today's \\"everyone's always looking over his shoulder\\" atmosphere.  But, what makes for an especially tough caper for Parker and his team of criminal experts, makes for an especially good read for us.  As usual, strong characterizations and tense situations abound.  And, as usual, the author once again has the otherwise upstanding citizens reading his books rooting for the crooks to get away with it.	2005-02-17

Chances are, you've seen this type of thing many times before- the quirky heroine who laces lots of observational humor into her first-person musings about the case-but that doesn't take away from the fact that this getting-to-be-threadbare formula is once again done competently here.	2005-02-10

The book isn't wildly entertaining, but so what?  Both the mystery plot and the personal subplot- about Sunny attempting to deal with her ex-husband's recent re-marriage- are credible, interesting and compelling, and in the end further cement Mr. Parker's reputation for always delivering a reliably good read.	2004-12-29

King tells us a wonderful, imaginative story, thousands of pages long, ultimately just to remind us of this simple truth: the importance in life of... stopping to smell the roses!  Roland is even seen on the cover of the book doing just that.  Too bad he didn't do it in the actual story, instead of pushing on with his obsession after he'd already saved the multi-verse.  If, after dispatching the Crimson King, Roland would have taken a page from Susannah's book and said enough is enough, the Gunslinger's final fate might have been less heart-rending.  At least the author gave him a glimmer of hope in the final page or so: after catapulting Roland back in time to once again begin his endless quest, he showed that Roland THIS time had displayed a bit of sentimentality and stopped to pick up Cuthbert's horn on Jericho Hill... maybe THAT tiny difference will finally break the cycle the NEXT time he reaches the Dark Tower and has to decide whether or not to go inside.<br /><br />This time, though, Roland's tragedy is our memorable ending: what a brilliant, brilliant move to end the series with the same wonderful line that started it: \\"The man in black fled across the desert and the Gunslinger followed.\\"  Bravo, Mr. King.  And thanks for the ride.	2004-12-20

Maybe it's just me, but I don't mind that Scarpetta, Marino, Lucy, Benton, etc. are pretty much continuously cranky, annoyed, and unhappy in the past several installments of this series.  After all, just because characters' jobs and cases are interesting, do they always have to be likable and fun to be around?  Myself, I think it's kind of interesting that the characters in these books are much more dysfunctional than the people reading their adventures.  It makes for more involving fiction.  Along those lines, the story this time out isn't bad, either.  Cornwell spins out three or so seemingly unrelated plotlines, then cleverly and unpredictably shows how they're all related. The whole affair ends a bit abruptly, but real cases often get closed suddenly thanks to a good tip, so I didn't have too much of a problem with that here.  Also, with the previous three books in this series centering around the wolf guy who bit people and smelled like a wet dog, it was nice to get back to a nice, simple one-shot villain again.  All in all, \\"Trace\\" was good, fast-paced, cranky fun.	2004-10-14

Carl Gottlieb's updated edition of his \\"The Jaws Log\\" is a good example of how entertaining such a book can be.  It's nothing spectacular, just a solid, anecdote-laced account of a movie now famous for its production horror stories.  Lots of new footnotes (about 20 pages worth) update the reader on what's happened since the book's original 1975 debut as well as providing further details not in the earlier edition, but it should be said that the original 1975 manuscript was still pretty candid for a merchandising tie-in.	2004-10-12

I enjoyed being dropped into an area of this country not done to death in other stories; the Georgia Appalachian region is a very interesting place.  The mystery story itself is pretty good; like a lot of good mysteries, the story effectively ties the mystery story into the history and dark secrets of the story's setting.  The diverse characters and the colorful banter between them are also very enjoyable.	2004-09-23

It's got the quips, a nice little plot heavy on sex and greed (both topics always good in a thriller), an amusing new supporting character or two (Spenser's CPA friend is fun) and continues the happy trend of recent Spensers by not relentlessly promoting the value of psychiatrists and therapists to the reading public.  All in all, an enjoyable read.	2004-04-28

I can undertand fans' frustration that Mr. Jordan doesn't just finish his epic story, but the fact remains that this prequel volume is still pretty readable.  In fact, with its scenes of young Moirane and Suian running through the halls of the White Tower trying to unravel its mysteries and intrigues, &quot;New Spring&quot; almost reminded me of a Harry Potter story.  Maybe that's intentional; perhaps Mr. Jordan and his editors are trying to instill in the powers-that-be in Hollywood the cinematic possibilities of this epic series.  A prequel story probably wasn't needed to do that, but here it is.  At least things moved along at a nice pace and a variety of compelling events took place.  Perhaps Mr. Jordan's somewhat reinvigorated writing style will bode well for the next volume of the main storyline.	2004-02-11

Not completely divorced from the flavor of the films to follow several years later (Bond is, after all, brought down in a \\"gadget\\" scene where metal spikes are released from the back of the villain's car while Bond pursues him), this first James Bond adventure nevertheless delivers a more introspective and moody Bond than we are used to from the films.  For my money that's a plus, as in the unusual, unpredictable plot structure:  the main hero vs. villain story is satisfyingly concluded about two thirds of the way into the book, and the rest of the story concentrates on Bond's physical recovery from his assignment, and the psychological ramifications of Bond's harrowing experiences during the case.  These concluding themes are almost as interesting as the earlier caper plot (those it's weird to see Bond for a while get seriously philosophical about who is truly \\"good\\" and who is truly \\"bad\\" on the geo-political stage), and it's all capped with a memorable ending.  Fleming's writing also benefits from an effective sense of place; no one is better at describing restaurants, casinos, tourist districts, local customs, etc.  We feel like we're really along with James Bond on his adventures.	2004-02-04

But if you cut it a bit of slack and forgive some of the overly broad plotting and comedy, it actually does a fair job of providing a few hours of genuine entertainment.  It certainly delivers the flavor of the original show, before countless Trek novels had added layers of subtle characterization and other levels of sophistication to the original mythos.  Not that those latter improvements are bad, but it was nice to read a story that, aside from the longer length, felt just like an original Trek episode.  Fun, and worth seeking out.	2004-01-08
US	52966690	R20HI066O9NEZC	0451160525	511631376	The Gunslinger (Dark Tower)	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Jump on at the beginning, but the best is yet to come.	I want to say this carefully, because, in the end, \\"The Gunslinger\\" is a good book.  It's mysterious, moody, and full of memorable imagery.  You'll most likely be very glad you read it (especially in this new revised edition, which, interestingly, is tighter and yet breathes more at the same time).  But you should be aware that this first volume in Mr. King's epic (and soon to be completed!) dark fantasy series does not quite reach the \\"must-read\\" status easily achieved by subsequent volumes in the \\"Dark Tower\\" epic.  I'm betting, in fact, that many of you out there who read this book will say something positive but ultimately lukewarm at its close, something like this: \\"Good book, I'll have to pick up the next one one of these days.\\"  And that would be a mistake, because you should pick up volume 2 (\\"The Drawing of the Three\\") immediately, not \\"soon\\" or \\"someday\\".  The second volume is THAT good, showcasing King's imagination firing on all cylinders, with memorable, amazing scenes happening right out of the box.  The plan may have been at least partially intentional... King may have said, \\"let's give the readers something more reserved and thoughtful at first, and then hit them hard in volume two by stirring in the really amazing and visceral stuff.\\"  Anyway, read \\"The Gunslinger\\".  It's great (I actually give it about three-and-a-half stars).  But do yourself a favor and stay on the ride and keep reading the other books, when things really take off.  Trust me, you'll be glad you did.	2003-08-27

Ample and very entertaining cleverness is on display in the opening chapters of this book, as author Westlake constructs a truly imaginative yet believable scenario where an everyday middle-class New Yorker suddenly wakes up to find himself an undercover operative for a radical activist group from the Ukraine!  Ample and very entertaining cleverness is also on display in the middle section, as our hero (the middle-class New Yorker) finds satisfying ways to regain a measure of control and turn the tables on his foreign handlers... for a time, anyway.  The final chapters, alas, dispense with the ample and entertaining cleverness, but still deliver serviceable scenes of escape attempts, confrontation, and resolution.  All in all, then, we end up with a pretty good thriller that is easily worth spending a couple of days reading on the porch or at the beach.	2003-05-21

I started this series to kill time while waiting for the next \\"Wheel of Time\\" book by Robert Jordan, and was surprised by not only its quality, but its complete lack of \\"slow\\" parts (a facet of Jordan's writing one has to get used to).  Also, though there's not a lot of \\"fantasy\\" per se in this first volume, wait 'til you see the final scene!  On those last couple of pages, Martin certainly delivers a memorable scene of drama and enchantment to whet your appetite for volume two.  Which I'm just about to start.	2003-05-06

Readers also get to see Parker's other hero, police chief Jesse Stone, entertainingly interact with Spenser and Hawk for about twenty pages.  As an added bonus, the novel is refreshingly free of Mr. Parker's usual endorsements for psychiatrists, therapists, etc., the bane of many of his thrillers.  I'm glad he's been lightening up on that stuff lately, as it was getting a bit tiresome.  Not EVERYONE needs to rush out to a psychiatrist to solve their problems, after all.  Finally, also interesting is that &quot;Back Story&quot; delivers quite an indictment on many aspects of the hippie generation (see the quote at the top of this review), an indictment that comes off as credible even if you admire a lot of what that generation was trying to do.  All in all, an entertaining and thoughtful read.	2003-03-31

No, the plot doesn't advance much, but &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot; is still a pleasant, fast read and by no means the literary travesty many here make it out to be.  Other installments in the series had more hugely dramatic developments; I think this one was genuinely meant to be a book of more modest pleasures.  As such, I think it works just fine.  I'm still on board for the next one.	2003-03-18

You've enjoyed the two &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; movies released so far and maybe thought about trying out some epic fantasy in printed form, right?  But then you saw that most fantasy series out there are either at least half a dozen volumes long (or more!) or have individual volumes thick as a telephone book.  In some cases, both descriptions are true!  So, naturally you run out of the bookstore screaming in fear at the prospect of conquering all those pages.  Well, here's your solution... if you're open to or already familiar with the comics medium, pick up the first two volumes of CrossGen's epic &quot;Sojourn&quot; graphic novel series.  This volume, plus volume 1 (&quot;From the Ashes&quot;) together collect the first 12 issues of this terrific fantasy series, and the story so far gives you the type of drama, wonder, adventure, and humor you experienced in Peter Jackson's films (though with its own personality and flavor), but without the time commitment, fuss, and... well, drudgery, of having to wade through a four-pound doorstop of a book (or two, or three, or... you get the picture).  Instead of getting your weightiness from the literal weight of the book, you'll get it from the epic goings-on, courtesy of Ron Marz's entertaining writing, and from Greg Land's wonderfully detailed artwork.  And for those of you who don't mind a nice, thick book, and even like 'em, don't worry, you do get well over a hundred pages in each of these first two volumes, plenty of pages to let you get good and immersed in the story.  But not enough to send you away screaming.	2003-03-03

Especially recommended for those who have been enjoying Peter Jackson's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; films and readers of such fantasy series as Robert Jordan's &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; books.  But really, this graphic novel/collection is for anyone who likes high adventure with a little heart to it.

How good are these stories?  Well, right out of the box, we meet Daredevil's first love turned killer-for-hire Electra (in Miller's FIRST issue as writer!); get plunged into a major gangwar featuring the Kingpin, Bullseye, and the mysterious group of ninja assassins known only as &quot;The Hand&quot;; meet yet another previously unseen figure from Daredevil's past, his streetwise and battle-scarred teacher and mentor &quot;Stick&quot;; and experience all kinds of other fun stuff still talked about twenty years after the stories first appeared.  And I haven't even talked about the memorable, operatic Daredevil #'s 180, 181, and 182, the classic issues that close this volume.  By the way, the storyline of the upcoming Daredevil movie was heavily influenced by this fan-favorite run of stories, so why not experience them in their original form first?  Great stories, great art, and even some humor (in the form of recurring, not-very-efficient crooks Turk and Grotto)-- what more can you want?	2003-01-22

One thing's for sure, though... Mr. Barris went right to the classics (a mystery classic, anyway) to draw inspiration for his ending. The final confrontation in this book effectively emulates the memorable final confrontation in Mickey Spillane's \\"I, The Jury\\". Of course, Barris adds a feel-good epilogue, but even that's a little off-center and edgy. All in all, an entertaining read.	2003-01-21

Volume One of &quot;Daredevil Visionaries: Frank Miller&quot; is a terrifically entertaining collection, giving us the first nine issues that Frank Miller worked on during his famous run on the &quot;Daredevil&quot; title from the late 70's to the mid-80's.  Just keep in mind that these are early Miller works, before he finally broke forth as the brilliant writer/artist he would later become on both this title and many others.  Here he isn't the writer at all, in fact (though a &quot;co-plotter&quot; credit eventually emerges), but instead is teamed up with writers Roger McKenzie and David Michelinie.  The result are some pretty basic but undeniably entertaining superhero adventures featuring such villains as the Gladiator, the Mauler, Doctor Octopus, and fan favorite Bullseye.  Yes, one definitely sees signs of the Miller-to-come emerging (especially in some of the darker, brooding panel layouts), but try not to fixate too much on that history-in-the-making aspect and just enjoy these prime examples of the kind of great old Silver Age superhero melodrama that Marvel cornered the market on early in the game.	2003-01-07

Worth seeking out for comics fans; this story is like a good six-issue run of the Spider-Man comic-book that was conveniently transcribed into a single volume of prose.  Just the right mix of melodrama, action, mystery, and witticisms keep things chugging along.  Strange, though, that this volume is out of print while the two other parts of the &quot;Sinister Six&quot; trilogy are still easily available.  Still, a used copy isn't that hard to find, especially online.	2002-12-30

That's certainly the case here: the stories in this collection are all fast-paced, entertaining mystery thrillers, but these \\"tall tales\\" are also laced with lots of authentic period description and accurate biographical details about the true-life crime, crime-fighting, or celebrity figures depicted. It was especially interesting to read about Nate Heller's \\"true encounter\\" with Eliot Ness, where we learn that Ness wasn't quite the white-bread hero depicted in Brian De Palma's admittedly terrific \\"The Untouchables\\". All in all, a vastly entertaining and informative read.	2002-12-16

Other plusses are the Paris setting and the interesting peek into the world of black musicians over the past several decades.  Give this one a whirl; it's worth your time.	2002-12-13

Of course, the main reason to check out this book is the white-hot assault on organized religion, &quot;Letters From The Earth&quot;, that opens things up and from which this volume draws its title.  Agree or disagree, you won't soon forget Twain's memorable tirade.  No wonder, though, that he chose to keep it to himself while still nurturing his publishing career.	2002-12-04

Maher reads aloud the essays from his book in an energetic and engaging manner that makes you forget he's reading a prepared text at all.  The nature of the book- lots of short essays on a variety of topics- reminded me a bit of Dennis Miller's various &quot;Rants&quot; books, but here the emphasis is less on comedy and more on making interesting points about various aspects of the post-911 world.  But don't worry, the heavy topics are definitely balanced with some laugh-out-loud humor; in fact, Maher usually uses that humor to punctuate and underline his most serious points.  In any event, this is definitely a painless way to expose yourself to some of the difficult issues we need to think about these days.	2002-12-04

Anderson wants to give you an epic of &quot;Dune&quot; proportions, but one that won't potentially alienate large segments of his readership with long stretches of endless description.  In other words, he keeps things moving with short chapters, a zippy pace, and exciting developments.  The cynics may say that this approach is a depressing concession to the MTV generation and its short attention span; but, in the end, what's wrong with wanting to tell an exciting, fast-moving story?  Bring on volume two, this one's a winner.	2002-12-04

But try to resist that temptation and enjoy the unique pleasures of this Philadelphia-based thriller in a more leisurely manner; after all, there's a lot here to appreciate.  Part Mickey Spillane, part \\"NYPD Blue\\", Sand's \\"Private Justice\\" nevertheless also sports its own unique perspective, one mainly fueled by the author's wicked sense of humor and an imagination that doesn't shy away from vivid imagery and ideas, even very uncomfortable ones.  On this latter point, Sand's guideline seems to be \\"If it'll be memorable, I'll throw it in.\\"  In addition to these... uh, memorable scenes (am I making it clear that this book isn't for fans of the neat & bloodless \\"cozy\\" mystery genre?), readers also are kept on their toes by some crafty plot construction.  For example, though the cover identifies the story as \\"A Lucas Rook Mystery\\", Sand freely drops his official protagonist for chapters at a time to pay entertaining attention to a pair of nicely-drawn Philly cops covering the same case, and even has said cops regularly trash the methods and reputation of Rook (and without Sand then leaping in to re-establish his main character as a nice guy).  It's clear that Sand just wants to tell a bang-up story and doesn't worry about who we like and why.  In other words, he just wants you to keep eating those potato chips.  And it's working... pass me another bag.	2002-11-19

But, you know something?  So what?  The book is cleverly designed and laid out, it's a cute size, and you STILL get a good hundred-plus pages to read.  Okay, so maybe a bigger font was used and there are larger than usual spaces between lines to stretch the story to a decent number of pages.  But again, so what?  It's easier to read that way.  I bought this little book both as a way to experience the original story before seeing the new movie and to obtain an interesting-looking movie tie-in.  It really is an eye-catching book.  Oh, the story?  I liked it just fine.  What is interesting is that the story itself doesn't make any overt judgements about that whole future world and its &quot;pre-crime&quot; system of law enforcement.  The characters simply find ways to deal with the problems created by the system, and happily move on (well, those that survive, that is).  I'm thinking that the movie will have more to say about the dangers of trusting technology too much and giving the police too much power.  Which could mean that the movie could be even more complex and interesting than the original story, or conversely, too &quot;preachy&quot; and overstated.  We'll see.  But don't be afraid to pick up this book.  Despite some of the comments here, I nevertheless think it's an interesting, fun way to get hold of the original story.	2002-06-04

It was fun to read this book and rent some of the films as they were being discussed. Another plus: the book is peppered with informative and revealing guest essays by the likes of Francis Coppola, Joe Dante, Martin Scorcese, Jack Nicholson, and various other directors, actors, and producers who worked with and/or got their start with Roger Corman. Though most of the comments about Mr. Corman in these essays are predictably laudatory, we are also allowed to read the occasional critical or negative observation, which permits the reader to get a nicely balanced view of the subject. The book is rounded out by a great selection of photos from the dozens of movies covered.	2002-01-02

Once you resign yourself to the fact that every Robert Parker detective thriller will throw bouquets of roses at the psychiatric industry (Mr. Parker appararently believing that, along with a good dry cleaner and reliable auto mechanic, we should all have a handy therapist or shrink within easy reach), you can relax and enjoy the snappier aspects of this reliable author's craft. These always include razor-sharp banter; sophisticated humor; involving detective plots that are sufficiently complex but never incomprehensible; and some qenuine depth on the part of the good AND bad guys. All of this good stuff is strongly in evidence in &quot;Death in Paradise&quot;, the third Jesse Stone thriller, which is a fast, enjoyable read. Alas, you also get the afformentioned sales pitch about the importance of signing up with a good shrink (it must have really killed Mr. Parker not to be able to harp on that theme in his recent Wyatt Earp novel), but hey, those passages kind of just roll off the back now. And to be fair, though the shrink/therapist scenes and discussions get tiresome fast, I do enjoy the fact that Jesse isn't perfect and is a long way from getting his life completely together. It makes him more interesting to read about.	2001-12-18

Tom Grace's story doesn't really add anything new to the techno-thriller genre, but it is nevertheless interesting due to some multi-faceted characterizations: even the featured good guys have some dark secrets and less than savory aspects to their personalities.  Good pacing, nicely drawn secondary characters, and a story that doesn't overstay its welcome also help things along.	2001-06-26

It may show a peaceful scene of a communications tower set against a beautiful sunset sky, but the story inside is anything but understated and peaceful.  What you get is a gritty police thriller laced with assaults, burglaries, striking police, and charges of departmental corruption.  There IS subtlety, but in the context of a bang-up, rough police adventure.  &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot; isn't groundbreaking, but if you are looking for a solid effort in the police thriller genre, this novel isn't half bad.	2000-11-30

For my money, no one portrayed normal people tentatively reaching out and forming connections- whether they were romantic, sexual, or just to ease oppressive loneliness- than Mr. Collins. And all this sensitively drawn character interaction took place amidst bang-up, engrossing thriller plots set in middle American locales we hadn't seen a million times before. But enough about the past; Mr. Collins now primarily devotes his time to historical mysteries, mainly his Nate Heller series that mixes real-life famous figures with his fictional characters. This clever novel, &quot;The Titanic Murders&quot;, goes a step further: pretty much everyone in the novel is real, though of course the mystery story is fictional. Yes, we don't get the gritty realism of Collins' contemporary thrillers, but I have to say I enjoyed this speculative story about real-life mystery writer Jacques Futrelle and his final days on the Titanic. And although (like most of Collins' current historical fiction) the story is fanciful and larger than life, readers still get to enjoy glimpses of the old Collins in the form of understated, pleasing character interaction between Futrelle, his wife, and their traveling companions. I still rather see Collins write about his Nolan, Mallory, and Quarry characters, but I honestly did enjoy this well-researched, involving, and fast-paced thriller, which is a genuine cut above most of the &quot;quickie&quot; Titanic products that flooded the market after the success of the James Cameron film.	2000-08-03

It's clear that a team of polished professionals was behind the audiobook version of &quot;Rogue Planet&quot;.  After all, the story is nicely read aloud with drama and feeling by Michael Cumpsty; and there is intelligent  and thoughtful placement of music and sound effects.  But, the story... oh,  the story.  From what my friends tell me, Greg Bear is an imagininative and  skilled storyteller, and there ARE some interesting concepts on display  here.  But the concepts, as well as the characterizations and drama, can  only be enjoyed in infrequent glimmers during this audiobook, due to the  severe abridgement.  So I really can't tell you if this story is  consistently good or not, as most of it was left on the cutting room floor,  with the remainder ending up more than a bit confusing, good production  values or not.  Look at it this way.  Unabridged, this novel would take  about eight to ten cassettes (if not more) to produce as an audiobook.  This audio is three cassettes.  Do the math: listeners are getting about  one third of the story that those reading the book are getting.  If  publishers want to keep costs down and release audiobooks of shorter  length, why not commission stories that take three or four cassettes to  fill, intead of cutting down much longer stories to fit the three or four  cassette format?  Is it because publishers want to release simultaneous  hardback editions of their stories, and that a hundred page novella  (perfect for a three or four tape unabridged audio adaptation) would be too  short for such a hardback?  Here's an easy solution: commission three  &quot;Star Wars&quot; original novellas (about a hundred pages each) from  different science fiction writers of note, and publish them in a nice  hardback called &quot;Tales of the Jedi Knights&quot; or something along  those lines. Then publish three SEPARATE audiobooks, with each three or  four cassette audiobook adapting one of those stories in unabridged  fashion.  This seems like a workable solution to the problem of nearly  incomprehensible abridged audiobooks.

US	52966690	RYC0Z1PH706BI	0553527258	48196867	I Rant, Therefore I Am	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Nice breather between longer audiobooks, and funny, too	I often listen to long unabridged audiobooks (usually in the car) of titles I simply don't have time to otherwise read.  Between those long titles, I enjoy taking a breather to enjoy a shorter, punchier audio, like  a four-cassette mystery anthology or a one or two tape comedy production.  &quot;I Rant, Therefore I Am&quot; was a fun example of the latter.  Funny  stuff, here.  I especially enjoyed the way Miller varied his rants' subject  matter between lofty topics like the war on drugs to everyday stuff like  pets.  And I had to smile when I heard that Miller wasn't above doing a  rant about a topic covered by nine hundred comedians nine hundred and ten  times before: the trials and tribulations of air travel (it was one of the  funnier rants, too).  A minor quibble is that one or two rants should have  been done again from the top due to a frog suddenly materializing in  Miller's throat halfway into a rant (though even this was a bit fun, as it  generated entertaining suspense as we wonder if he will make it to the end  before his voice TOTALLY breaks up).  Also, there were one or two instances  where the dramatic emphasis was placed on the wrong word, thus weakening  the strength of the punchline.  But again, this is minor stuff, which  somehow even contributed to the organic feel of the piece, reminding us  that it's a real guy out there complaining about all this stuff.  I didn't  mind that the tape is abridged, either.  The weaker rants from the book  were left behind, leaving us with Miller performing aloud all the good  ones.  Survival of the fittest, after all!	2000-07-16

The laughs came from the short news items, however, NOT  the long parodies of newspaper editorials which are inserted after every  five or six news items.  The editorials are endless and dull, and confuse  the fact that an observation about something might be funny but having to  experience it might not be; for example, the IDEA of someone delivering a  ten-minute self-important editorial about something so NOT a part of our  daily lives as robots might generate a chuckle, but to actually have to  listen to such an editorial (as we do here) is agony. An editor worth his  salt would have seen that stuff like that wasn't working and performed some  needed cutting.  But, as long as you don't have to pay too much cash for  this, the audio is worth your time for the short news pieces, which are  mostly hilarious.	2000-07-16

Alfred Hitchcock explored the same themes over and over again (the wrong man accused; the trials and tribulations of being an icy blonde; how to deal with an overbearing mother, etc., etc.) but he did so in films that  were as different from one another as could be.  &quot;Psycho&quot; was  nothing like &quot;North by Northwest&quot; which was nothing like  &quot;The Birds&quot;, and so on.  Parker explores the same themes over and  over, too (his themes being the nature of honor, the nature of fidelity and  how it can survive in a hedonistic world, and how all crimes seem to harken  back to family dysfunction and other shaky psychological underpinnings).  The problem with Parker in recent years is that he has not sufficiently  done the Hitchcock thing: he has NOT hung his themes on sufficiently  different stories and plots.  In other words, Parker the artist was doing  fine but Parker the craftman was marking time in many ways.  I am happy to  say, however, that Parker the craftman worked a little harder in this  &quot;Spenser&quot; entry to give us something a little different.  Gone  (mostly, anyway)  is the Boston locale of practically every other Spenser  adventure; and members of the usual supporting cast are seen in small doses  or not at all.  The result is a freshness we haven't had in a while.  We  get to see some new scenarios and different types of characters; and we get  to once again see, for the first time in a while, extended scenes of  Spenser the introspective loner.  This was an enjoyable reading experience.  Yeah, I kinda missed Hawk, but I'm sure he'll be back next time.  I only  hope that Parker the craftsman continues to attempt to show us new things  in the next &quot;Spenser&quot; title, as he did here.  All those Boston  restaurants and those descriptions of how Susan eats like a bird ARE kind  of fun, but they can get somewhat tiresome, too!	2000-06-10

I'll only add one comment to all the other excellent and useful reviews posted for this title. I am someone who usually isn't crazy about either the fantasy genre OR really long books.  As &quot;The Eye of the  World&quot; is clearly both a fantasy novel AND a long book, I was  skeptical when a friend in the office began pushing me to read it.  Well, I  finally capitulated (gotta build those bridges with your colleagues!), and  was happily surprised that the book was not the ordeal I dreaded.  On the  contrary, the story was fast-moving and laced with interesting characters,  full of depth and complexity yet always adventurous and fun.  As of this  writing, I have moved on to the other titles in the series and am already  halfway through the entire &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; saga after less than a  year.  Give &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; a shot.  If a non-fantasy fan  like me can get hooked, I think anyone can!	2000-06-09
