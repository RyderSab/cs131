It's a vibrant book with a lot of detail focusing on the intertwining lives of all the characters all over the world. I also enjoyed it because being a very strongminded teenager who refuses to eat red meat, this is the answer to all the people around me who ridicule me for not eating red meat. The combination of science, romance, revival, and culture are a beautiful symphony. The ending will definitely surprise you.	2002-11-02

That's similar to someone else saying &quot;Well I had a bad childhood and my father beat me and my mother was a severe drug user so therefore everyone else in the United States beats their children and uses drugs.&quot;<br />I notice that she discusses social issues which are also a bit too general. People are individuals and don't act alike, even in conformist societies -- we all have little quirks. Therefore, it's unfair to generalize about social characteristics of the Japanese. Also, because she had one or two experiences with vulgarity on the trains in Japan doesn't make a whole race of men pigs. We have problems with people acting up in New York City subways, but that doesn't make every person in NY insane or vulgar. <br />If it wasn't for her great writing style I'd be severely disappointed. However, I still find myself floating in and out of reading the book while reading on the train, and it's not because the people are being vulgar or obnoxious, it's just redundant to her last work. I was also very turned off to her treatment of her husband, and I agree with other reviewers that her rationale is clouded at points. I would rework this into a more socially - current work if I were Ms. Mori, because there's definitely nothing wrong with the writing.	2001-08-31

Ms. Mori had valid points to discuss, even if they were depressing. <br />A deeper message lies in the book -- you cannot change people. A perfect example is Hiroshi Mori, her father. Even as an old, sickly man, he has had no remorse or second - thoughts about the pain he has put his only daughter through, instead remaining a selfish, self centered old man. <br />Her writing style is rich and filled with long, poetic sentences, and I wish she was *my* creative writing teacher. She fails to be self-pitying and offers her humility to the reader by gently feeding it to them, not pounding out paragraph after paragraph of remorse and sorrow. I enjoyed her anecdotes about her childhood and her (limited) memories of her family, and this book is just as good, if not better, than the other works she has written. It's so nice to have read such a consistently well versed author.	2001-08-17

I've read reviews describing Mr. Quinn as being paranoid and fanatical, and I beg to differ. Mr. Quinn is not randomly selecting a corporate victim, but is speaking on behalf of the &quot;little people&quot; who are turned into thoughtless, emotionless drones by the corporations surrounding them. In this case, it happens to be Wal-Mart.<br />His statements are not unfounded, as he can cite proof for all cases that he discusses. <br />Mr. Quinn has a definite sense of humor that outshines many other authors. He speaks like your feisty older next-door neighbor, speaking in an authoritative manner brought about by life's experience and not by an overblown ego. <br />Think about it, though...This man has nothing to gain by writing this book, making an individualistic stand against the masses. Why begrudge him the right to write his opinions? Sometimes the truth hurts, but the lies can hurt even more. Think even of daily sweatshop abuses that are reported; they even make a difference in most cases, as consumers change their minds about purchasing certain brands. At some point or another, we need to get our thoughts across to the public, in order to preserve our human dignity in the face of those who would like to sell us out for the sake of the American dollar.<br />Mr. Quinn, thank you for this book.	2001-08-08

First of all, she speaks of how her maid, Jada, is forced to toil to pay for her education and her brother's education. Sultana then goes on a few chapters later to spend $400,000 in a department store, and even later, discusses how her family is worth $900,000,000. A bit of hypocrisy there, don't you think? If she was so concerned with her maid's plight, she would probably paid off her education, no questions asked.<br />If she's so concerned with the plight of women, then why doesn't she care when she buys overpriced sweatshop clothing from the same stores she purchases entire sections of? Furthermore, what can I say for a woman who is so big on talking about how religious she is, yet gorges herself on alcohol, cigarettes, and thinks nothing of her drug - abusing relatives?<br />It's one thing to TALK about something, and another thing to DO something about it. This book exists to show off and create a self-absorbed attitude about a woman who can't even give her real name, yet put her picture on the cover of all her books. What's the point anymore? A trilogy of books, yet they're all redundant and hurtful in the way they rub in her wealth and her &quot;better than thou&quot; status.	2001-07-29

That's how much I enjoy reading it. :)<br />The book is small and dense, with heavy coated pages filled with big diagrams, lush colored pictures, and great explanations of the concepts. It takes the reader from choosing a camera to developing, and doesn't miss a beat in between. <br />I have a digital camera, and although I cannot develop my film by hand, I can still use the technical advice, the zoom/speed/exposure/aperture techniques, and can even duplicate some of the development effects using Adobe Photoshop, now that I know what they are called in the photography world. It's great for anyone who owns anything from a 110 camera to a big shiny digital camera, because the advice is helpful along all technical platforms.	2001-07-29

She has three loving children she can provide excellent care for. She had already aired the dirty laundry of the lives of Saudi women in her first book, &quot;Princess.&quot;<br />SO WHAT HAPPENED?<br />There was little focus on Sultana's daughters, and I was expecting some sort of conflict-resolution to result as I concluded this work, maybe in the form of her older daughter being ripe for marriage combatting society. Furthermore, there was a lot of redundancy, as she took it upon herself to explain parts of the first book in the second book. <br />I would die for one percent of this woman's material wealth.

I would have been a bit more impressed with Princess Sultana's story were she not a princess and had spoken more for the lower classes than for her personal experiences. I think if I had exhorbitant wealth and status, not to mention the ability to move about in other countries freely with the flick of a wrist and the appearance of a newly - bought jet, I would buckle down and be a bit more accepting of the conditions around me. The book seems to be written in too much of a &quot;me me me&quot; style, and shows little concern for the impoverished classes, where they have no way out of their lives of mediocrity and pain, where they must live in the desert, and have no choice in life or death. Believe me, I know these problems of women's rights exist in Arab countries, but the whole book did not really hit hard enough, because the wealth of Sultana overshadowed everything and softened the grittiness of daily Arab life.	2001-07-27

I have not looked into the actual accuracy of the dates and events that occurred, but instead read the book to acquire some background knowledge about the Queen. However, I'd be interested to know why the family tree shows the son of a duke being two years older than his father. :)<br />The book reads like a soap opera, without too much emphasis on the political background of Marie Antoinette and Louis the Sixteenth, and more emphasis on the dirty little details of their private lives. However, there seemed to be too much repetition involved in discussing the Queen's affair with Swedish count Axel Fersen, and in these points, the book could become dry and only worth skimming. I also found myself confused at the switching of names between Princess Marie Therese and Madame Royale from chapter to chapter, when they were in fact the same person.<br />The ending was beautiful, sophisticated, and simple. I appreciated the epilogue, because I found myself interested in what happened to the (few) survivors of the French Revolution. The cover was well done also, and is a beautiful work overall. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in a biography about scandalous royalty. :)	2001-07-25

Its style is mature, fails to be self - pitying, culturally and socially aware, and is also very down to earth. The epilogue finishes the work beautifully, giving the reader a look at the present life of the mature Ji - Li Jiang, and positively sums up why she wrote the book.

I didn't learn much about her high school experience, which is one of the most crucial times in your early life, and I had no idea what had gone on past eighth grade. Furthermore, I'd love to know how she was treated in Harvard, as she grew more and more detached from her family. <br />The author has an easy - going writing style which makes this book a good read, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in reading an autobiography about a nonsuperfluous, unpretentious, normal human being.	2001-07-09

While I could normally finish this book in maybe two sittings, it took me almost two weeks to actually finish it, because despite how interesting the plot was, it got boring. There was so much to be said, and too little time to say it. The musical history was far from boring, nor were the character's commentaries on each other's work. However, the way it was structured, it was just a bit too detailed for my taste. However, this is the first book I have read by Landis and I believe I shall be looking for more as of this point on.	2001-07-08

Can I ask where someone like this gets the right to complain? This wasn't a matter of dealing with mixed race/religion, this was a chance to whine about who had more money than her already privileged self, who she had sex with, and how wonderful she was. <br />I've never seen an author that never admits she made a mistake, and how the fault is with everyone else around her. For example, how can she expect people not to call her racist names if she hangs around drugged up losers who cut class and drink all the time, rather than working on making a difference in their lives?<br />She complains so much, it feels like fingers going down a blackboard. I'm a very well cared for teenage girl who is given a lot of loving attention and almost anything (within financial reason) that she asks for, but believe me, if mommy and daddy gave me my own car, a computer in a time when they were a rarity (in the mid 80s), trips all over Europe, and paid tuition to Yale, I wouldn't have the gall to write a book such as this. <br />On the other hand, a female who had to start from the bottom, upwards, with a mixed race in a time of adversity would be a more interesting story. Ironically, it seems the people who are least in the position to complain seem to make the most noise.<br />Just a quick question, also: who died and gave her the right to publish personal information about all the people she had sexual activity with? Or does Ms. Walker lack proper etiquette and respect to individuals around her to not spread all her dirty laundry all over the world? <br />The only positive point I see with this novel is that she has a nice writing style. Maybe she should write books like her mommy does.	2001-06-25

It took FOREVER to finish because it was boring! It had so much to say, but redundantly made its point. I'd give it 3 stars as an overall review. <br />Somehow I doubt that Grazia could just leave Judah and run off with Lord Pirro. Wouldn't that be fatally taboo in Christian society, and wouldn't the Jewish people sit shiva for her and take her son from her, Anna Karenina style? I also find it hard to believe that she could have sex so much throughout the book and get pregnant only once. It seems too convenient. <br />Maybe I'll wait for Ms. Park to write more and then see if she's changed her plot structure to complement her rich writing style.	2001-06-24

Yet, I've now read three books by this wonderful author, and the redundancy of the themes is ruining my experience. Why do all the characters have to end with such downtrodden lives, where the girls get pregnant by the middle of the book, the sister is a wannabe diva, and the father and mother just plain don't care? <br />As for the stereotypes, I think that the stereotypes bring the book alive. You're not supposed to really question the motives of the characters, but instead see how they play out in terms of the main character's life. <br />Think about it -- if the stereotypical chauvanistic men were sensitive and thoughtful in the book, read Shakespeare, drank port wine instead of beer and snorted coke, remained monogamous, and spoke proper English, would the book be interesting? They're part of the tension that lies in Toni Yagyuu's life, and help shape the experience around her. If they were proper young men, would we really discover that Maverick and Wyatt actually had a sensitive side? Would we even be dealing with the issue of her not knowing who the father was? No, because they'd be acting perfectly from page one, and wouldn't both be sleeping with Toni at the same time. The lives of the characters simply cannot be perfect in order to have a book with a decent plot.<br />However, the lives of the characters shouldn't be played out over and over and over and over in each work Ms. Yamanaka writes. It's really beginning to disappoint me.	2001-06-04

At least this book was written about someone who genuinely needed help, and not some &quot;poor me&quot; story about someone who was never in a position to be pitied by his or her peers. <br />I didn't read it to learn more about mental illness, so maybe I have a different outlook on it. I looked more at the lives of the surrounding family rather than the life of his older schitzophrenic brother, and how they were shattered by the downfall of their child. I can't even imagine what that's like, to put your hopes and dreams into a child, and no matter what you do, you can never rescue them from the darkness.

This is a book that *should* be good. After all, the plot is excellent.  I don't know what it is, though, but this book is just not appealing to me, and I usually love historical novels. The writing is too scientific and precise, and the use of Italian words for common words like &quot;family&quot; and &quot;lady&quot; is plain obnoxious.

The use of fervent Christianity, symbolism, paranormal experiences, and emotional instability result resonate through my emotions. The surreal images were heartbreakingly beautiful when combined with the grittiness of seedy strip bars and junkies smacking up in filthy apartments. The experiences are intensified with the parallel surroundings of oceans versus Las Vegas. At first, I sat there reading it, racked by the explicit violence, hatred, and sadness, but soon I became numbed to the beauty of Hawaii and the heartache of Sonia Kurisu.

After seeing a biographical show about Christina Onassis, I became intrigued about the tragic life of one of the world's wealthiest women and picked up this book at my local library. <br />I was very impressed with the way it was written.  I began to wonder if Mr. Dempster was her shadow her whole life, for the depth of knowledge was practically disconcerting. It was a fast - moving book with plenty of clarity, maybe a bit too fast - moving, because I read all 170 pages in about three broken-up hours or so. <br />I would have been interested in knowing a bit more about her daughter, Athina, considering that she was actually a large part of her late mother's last few years upon earth. I understand completely it's rather difficult to be creative and offbeat when it comes to a nonfiction work, but the ending could have been better worked. A bit of a post - mortem chapter would have ended the book better, maybe discussing the obituaries written about Christina, or maybe describing what would happen in regards to her inheritance to her daughter. It seemed too callous to end it with something along the lines of &quot;Yeah, her friends all went home. The end.&quot;  <br />I enjoyed all three hours of this book overall. :)	2001-05-27

Perhaps it's just me, but I'm really beginning to feel like the McCourt family is just cashing in after Frank McCourt's two very successful novels. Of course, I'm not saying that Malachy McCourt is a bad writer, or that he has nothing positive to offer to the literary world, but this memoir left me with mixed feelings.<br />No doubt, Malachy has a witty sense of humor and an interesting way of perceiving the negative side to life, but on the other hand, the structure of this book rubbed me the wrong way. You're led to believe that his stepdaughter, Nina, had a great life in an institution, yet 100 pages later, you're reading about molested and neglected children in the home she was placed in. Meanwhile, he's gone on to talk about everything else twenty years later before coming back to discussing Nina.<br />I also ended the book with a feeling of &quot;What was this book's purpose?&quot; Many people experience tough lives while many people do not, but I felt the book lacked a significant climax, besides his health problems, which are nothing particularly unusual for people nowadays. <br />However, I'd be VERY interested to see what kind of fictional work that McCourt could turn out with his sense of humor.

What a mean mean man. He didn't deserve to shine her shoes.<br />I want to see more by Amanda Foreman.

Main character was brilliant, sweet, and refreshingly independent. The ending didn't make complete sense to me, but it was a novel worth reading overall, and it left me uplifted. I felt like he didn't know how to end the work, so he ended it as he did. (I won't go into the ending to prevent spoiling it for others.) <br />The perk to reading In Beautiful Disguises is you can feel the passion that goes behind each and every character's niche in life. This is rare in books, because usually the individuality of each interaction is sacrificed for the sake of keeping the focus on the main character. <br />Read it...and laugh.	2001-05-20

This book made me sick, and I don't know how I finished it. I cannot believe this woman wasted her time writing a book about her obviously spoiled daughter. There was no excuse for this girl's behavior, and maybe if her mother had set standards when she was twelve or thirteen, rather than wallowing in her own self - pity, none of this would have ever happened. <br />Living in a slummy neighborhood surrounded by poverty and crime, it disgusts me to see such a privilaged girl living in Marin County, the wealthiest county in the United States, thinking she was so persecuted, when in fact she lives better than most children in the United States. Oh boo hoo, her mother was divorced, but so are about half the households in the United States, and I don't see my friends and classmates acting like slovenly whores, cutting classes, and participating in drinking and drug use.	2001-05-19

She was a simpering, spoiled yuppie with a great job and a loving fiance, and none of it was ever good enough because the poor little rich girl was hit by her psychotic mother once. I sympathized more with her mother and her past rather than Sidda's present life. <br />The use of similes and metaphors and the ending were simply gorgeous, and I could smell the tropical flowers and the humidity of the bayou rested upon my face in the heat.	2001-04-29
