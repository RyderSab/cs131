IMHO this is the next best novel in the WH40K universe, second only to Ian Watson's excellent standard-setting INQUISITOR and SPACE MARINE.  In case anyone is not familiar to the WH40K universe theme, the future of mankind in the forty-first millenium is a galactic human empire beset on all fronts by demon infestation (''Chaos''). The Emperor is some sort of psychic god on earth - half-dead, conscious only by din of sheer force of willpower sustained by technology - presiding over a huge Theocratic empire spanning lightyears, the ecclesiastical structure employing deadly force and ruthless subterfuge to protect human race against being overwhelmed by demonic contamination. Imagine the Spanish Inquisition ruling a galactic empire. The imaginative vista is panoramic, sweeping and jaw-dropping. The opportunities for good yarn-spinning is enormous:- this is a cross between the Spanish Inquisition and Isaac Asimov's galactic empire, only this time the Inquisitors are the good guys trying to keep humanity, well, human. The opportunities for good yarn-spinning is enormous, and Ian Watson and Barrington J Bayley carries off the story-telling challenge with great polish and panache.  I generally enjoy WH40K stories immensely, and Ian Watson and Barrington J Bayley are IMHO two of the best WH40K authors to see the light thus far.  Go for it!  You'll be hugely entertained.	2005-06-24

Warning warning - don't buy this book. Warning warning. Donate your money to a worthy charity. On no account buy this book. Ostensibly written by Ian Watson who did such a astonishingly marvellous job with ''INQUISITOR'' (the 1st in this trilogy), ''Chaos Child'' (the 3rd book in this trilogy) does not have any meaningful plot, no action to speak of, no logical sequencing, just utter, utter inexplicable confusion.  Its as if Ian Watson commissioned a ghost-writer who is unfamiliar with the rich and baroquely complex WH40K universe, then did nothing but proof-read spelling errors and lent his name to the titlepage.

The story began with a tantalising pre-historic sequence of how the artefact was buried with an ancient king but then left the readers with no further 'retrospective' of how the artefact was used (or otherwise ravaged) the ancient world. Cut to the present, the reader is then confronted with huge chunks of irrelevant rivalry amongst academic-types, including a Greek archaeologist unfortunately miscast in an MCP role.  All very well but handled badly and detracting seriously from the implications of the Artefact on human history.

The nostalgia of many for Hitler and his Third Reich, the allure of his ideology, the sympathy of old and young in Germany and many other parts of the world for Hitler's lost cause, the strange attractions to many (including ironically Jews!) of Nazi memorabilia - all these are important sociological issues which merits a careful and forensic analysis.  The demise of the extreme right spectrum of the world political stage since WWII also deserved scholarly treatment.  What accounts for the  strange, surprisingly international appeal of Hitler in this day and age!?  This book offers none of that.  Yes, as the author admitted, it is a deeply personal enquiry into the question of why Hitler as the ideologue and model has refused to die - notwithstanding that Nazism was literally bombed into the sub-basement at the end of WWII.  It is personal to the extent of being badly organized, poorly conceptualized, and not held together by any coherent or well-thought out system or order.  This is a very shoddy treatment of a historically and sociologically significant topic, nearly an insult.  It reads like the author simply wrote out into full essay length his personal scrapbook.  Only mildly entertaining in odd places.  A grave disappointment.  Adolf deserves a better class of analyst.	2001-06-24

A supremely talented controversial figure (the world is still undecided whether he was a sole Good Nazi or whether he survived because he was a consumate actor who managed to swindle the International Tribunal in Nuremberg!) who served an even more controversial figure (Hitler), secretly wrote these diaries when he was serving out his 20 yrs jail term. Many curious and personal observations about the life of Third Reich's Best in prison routine, including Fuehrer No. Two, Adm Doenitz, Deputy Fuehrer Rudolf Hess, Reichbank chief Funk, Hitler Youth Supreme Leader Baldur von Schirach etc. Many many unique 'first person view' accounts of life at the pinnacle of the infamous Third Reich, as Hitler's favourite courtier. An invaluable historical document and a Must Read for the serious historian. At a personal level, this counts as one of history's foremost prison diary. Speer shines with his deeply insightful observation and analysis of the characters imprisoned in Spandau with him, and touches the reader with his effort at maintaining his dignity and sanity confronted with the dehumanising reality of a 20-year imprisonment. Speer was in turn analytical, psychological, poetical and soulful.  One finishes reading this book greatly puzzled how such a magnificently talented man with such a beautiful soul could have collaborated with Hitler.  This adds to the paradoxical mystery of Hitler as - in turn - maniacal dictator and art patron.  You draw your own conclusions whether Albert outsmarted everyone of the Nuremberg judges (save the Soviet one). I myself found it superbly entertaining, highly illuminating and deeply moving from one who not only was THERE, but there at the very TOP.  A unique historical First person account.	2001-05-12

However, the author did - in his extremely clumsy and inept fashion - painted a gruesome picture of a world under Nazi dominion:-  the vast network of death factories, race after race exterminated like so much varmin and consigned to the crematorium, a world-spanning network of vast autobahns, the Germans emerging as virtually the sole remaining race on earth, even glimpses of medicine and TV under a true Thousand Year World-Spanning Reich.

What if Uncle Adolf won WWII? Harris obviously did his research, and offers the transfixed reader a rare vision of the Hitlerian society had Nazi Germany existed till 1964. But b-a-a-a-a-d plotting flawed this novel. No character acted with conviction in the story. Much better if Harris had expanded this rather thin novel into a Dune-size novel with proper character-development. Harris could not explain plausibly the motives of Nebe, the Head of the nazi police, in aiding Sturmbannfuhrer Marsh, the leading flatfoot in this futuro-nazi whodunnit. Perhaps he could have stirred in a plot by top Nazis to exploit the scandal of the Holocaust to stage a supremely cynical putsch against Hitler and install a more &quot;acceptable&quot; liberal/progressive band of leaders acceptable to the civilized world (eg USA) with which alliance Germany is trying to enlist against the much-reduced USSR.

Prequel to 'THEIR MASTER'S WAR"	One of Mick's best works, this is where his story-telling talent was shown to its best advantage!  Basically an 'alien contact' sci-fi story, but set hundreds of years after the 1st contact, it portrays a conquered and  dispirited humanity living out its uncertain days under the iron heel  (claw?) of alien occupation.  The sense of vast, epic scale is effectively  hinted rather than expressed, which added vastly to the effectiveness of  the tale!  Mick has this thing about humanity being easily manipulable thru  our petty superstitutions, religious hang-up's and mass mania, and this  story is skilfully used by him to convey that cautionary tale.  Never a  boring moment, this 'aline contact' novel effectively conveys the sense of  the unknown as well as the transformatory nature of alien contact.A  rewarding and highly amusing read which is further developed in the  brilliant sequel 'THEIR MASTER'S WAR', a must-BUY! The character of 'The  Poet' - now tell me he is not a dead-ringer for Mick's persona as a rock  star/balladeer/story-teller?  Mick is like a brandname:-  his books  never disappoints!

A cautionary tale of war and tragedy	The sequel to 'PROTECTORATE', though one would not realise this till the very end, this is an excellently told tale of the entire human race reduced to cannon fodder by a race of conquering aliens.  A frightening,  entertaining, cynical, but above all ENTERTAINING tale told thru the  perspective of hapless infantry foot soldiers press-ganged into fighting a  vast, meaningless war waged by superior alien races.  One of my all-time  favourites 'war is hell' or 'space war' stories.  I am surprised and  saddened that this book has not been made into a movie (or at least a  computer RPG) yet.  Too dark, perhaps??  Remember the 60's TV series  'Combat'?  This is the space-going version of that.  IMHO, one of the best  'Mankind as Conquered Species' stories ever written, ranks right up there  with 'Men like Rats', 'The Tripod Trilogy' etc.  Mick's alien conquerors  are so sinister and effectively portrayed, makes the lizards of 'V' seem  like escapees from a children's pett'in zoo!  Anyone out there knows the  email address of Mick? Tell me at cthulhufatagn@hotmail.com, have been  wanting to compliment him personally for many years now.

It is certainly a good, crisp read, highly-entertaining to boot and chok-a-blok with high-tech gizmos (the gadget-freak would be delighted!). Story is told from the perspective of a paranoic but highly-skilled corporate assasin which the author somehow endears the reader to, notwithstanding the repugnant nature of the character's vocation. Mick's vision of future corporatist America dystopia has the eerie feel of plausible authenticity, and his grasp of action and dramatic-tension is unfailing. Every chapter reveals a new grand vista of adventure and action. Not his best, but certainly one of his better, works. Perfect for that long train or greyhound trip.
