Harley, Amber, Misty, Jody and Callie.  These - for the most part - are well drawn characters, each with their own idiosyncracies, beliefs and  secrets and while this is an obvious strength of the book perhaps it leads  to a glaring weakness.  Harley is an obvious charmer.  He has the great  ability to communicate what seems logical to him to us even when there is  very little logic there. And that is where I had the problem.  The  situations he describes - the many sexual ones with Callie for example -  mostly seem rushed and for the first time in a long time I came away  thinking that this 300+ page book should have been about 200 pages longer.   There seems to be something missing the first time the encounters start  with Callie.  What possessed her to become involved with him?  Nothing in  the book tells us.  The situations aside, Back Roads is a likeable book.  I  struggled with the frankness as I failed to see where the story was going -  Amber's involvement at the end however was far too obvious - but as I  reached the end I became acutely aware of the film Boys Don't Cry.  What  seems glorified suddenly becomes horrifyingly real as everything is put in  context and we see this family once again torn apart by acts of violence.   O'Dell's Back Roads is a solid read.  It is easily read, introduces you to  characters you'll probably remember, and tells a story that many of us will  find foreign.  That is what books are all about.  Not a must read but one  that many will get a lot out of.	2000-06-29

I started reading and with great surprise zipped through about the first hundred pages wanting to learn more and more about this incredibly complex woman.  Jo is perhaps one  of the more interesting female characters in any of the books Oprah has  chosen lately.  She has faults and yet I loved her even more for them.   Coupled with the little things like how the tips of Dana's fingers turned  white as she grasped the seat or how the dog seemd to grin helplessly every  time it panted, those faults help establish While I Was Gone as a real  exploration of real people.  But then unfortunately it turns silly.  Was  the bit about Eli supposed to be revelatory because if it was I didn't get  it.  You could see it coming a mile off and the pathetic attempt at romance  between Jo and Eli just didn't work.  I know some will say well it wasn't  supposed to, but c'mon.  <br />Miller obviously has a beautiful eye for detail  and I'll give another of her books a go but oh just for that edge of  reality that she so carefully weaves through her words on the first hundred  pages to have continued 'til the end of the book.  While I Was Gone could  have been something damn near perfect.	2000-06-15
US	51316921	RRZRMFRC4JZ8O	0375411550	331831848	The Bluest Eye	Books	4	4	6	N	N	An eye-opener	Toni Morrison has the uncanny knack for taking simple stories and making them wonderously, 'humanly' complex. What starts off as a clever incisive comment on how life is interpreted by different people quickly becomes a  conversation between the characters and the reader. What we learn as the  reader almost becomes a secret as the amazingly natural speech patterns  leave the mouth of Pecola. She is an extraordinarily human character. A  trait quite often missing from characters in literature today. From the  nightmares of the life that exists around her - the cat swinging passage  made me cringe - to the little bits of hope that exist in her thoughts we  are taken on a journey as she becomes involved with Pauline, Cholly, Sam,  Frieda, Claudia, Mrs. Breedlove and Junior. A journey far from many of our  lives but a journey that shows that when it comes down to it we all strive  for the same thing. We all want to be the very best we can. We want to try  and show courage. We want to try and be happy. It is a true Morrison  journey through and through. Human as human can be.<br />As an aside however,  what is Oprah doing? Isn't the purpose of a book club to broaden reading  habits and patterns? Toni Morrison is a great author! But should another  (the third) of her books be chosen? I don't know and while I loved The  Bluest Eye I just get a bit disappointed when Oprah takes an opportunity to  expose readers all around the world to new talent (note Sheri Reynolds and  A. Manette Ansay) and lets it pass her by by selecting books that I would  have thought many of her viewers would have already read.	2000-06-08

I tried so hard to get into Daughter Of Fortune and finally managed to, to find that Isabel Allende copped out and gave us the most ridiculous and pathetic ending she could have.  What starts off way too slowly manages to  pick up and starts to get really interesting and involving before Miss  Allende turns it into another ho hum melodrama.  Daughter Of Fortune  revolves around the life of Eliza a girl left on the doorstep of  aristocrats in Chile.  She is raised as their daughter and in turn becomes  something which she grows to find out she doesn't really want to be.  As  she meets and falls in love with a peasant - Joaquin Andieta - we are  presented with a potentially interesting and important topic - class  systems and the barriers that stand between people - but Daughter Of  Fortune soon turns into a road trip to the gold fields of California (a  road trip I could have done without).  The book also introduces Tao -  Eliza's friend on the trip - a Chinese medicine man who grows to like Eliza  more than what he first imagined he would.  This all turns out worse than  an episode of The Bold And The Beautiful and disappointed me, especially as  I really tried hard to get on its wave length.  I shouldn't have tried so  hard.  It's way too long and detailed - Allende needs to tone down the  description - but does show that Allende has the potential to explore  important themes in her books.  She stands above other authors who write in  the romance adventure genre primarily because she has talent as a writer  and because she is not afraid to research her material.  She now needs  however to get a good editor who can show her what to leave out and what to  throw away.  That I think is the difference between good authors and great  authors and what stands between Allende and the next league.  A  slight-notch-above-mediocre Oprah pick.	2000-03-11

Sure when you are reading it it seems like a nice little story lovingly told, but by the time you finish it you kind of sit back and think  okay, what's next?  The story that develops from Julie's witnessing her  brother's death to her marriage to Hank covers familiar territory.  We know  it was tough back then - especially for women - and we know that natural  disaster can have devastating effects, but what we don't know or could know  more about - beliefs, community, marriage - is left unchartered by author  Robert Morgan.  He introduces religion into the story but never examines  its real place or meaning to the people.  I wanted to know what gave them  such faith!   His writing is at times quite beautiful but at other times  verges on pedestrian.  His use of accent fails dismally and his story  repeats itself.  I understand that repetition is a literary device that  some authors use but here Morgan seems to use it to let the readers know  that men do make mistakes too.  It's almost as if he realised that perhaps  he was going to alienate some readers by introducing Julie's mistake in  handing over money and having Hank take his frustrations out on her, so he  decided to have Hank do exactly the same thing.  This is I admit a  &quot;nice&quot; book but one cannot help but wonder what someone with an  ability to push boundaries would have done with this material.  This is  Julie's story that should have been one with an edge, as it is Robert  Morgan's Gap Creek is Julie's story that seems to just fade in with every  other coming-of-age, marital relationship story ever written.	2000-02-25

It starts off so slowly  that one wonders where it may be headed and then it starts to gather  momentum until it totally shifts and finishes about 358 degrees from where  it started.  What makes it work I think is that the characters develop.  We  see our young heroine mature and grow amongst the many people around her.   Perhaps there are too many.  I constantly had to reread sections to try and  remember who people were but I found in the end the relationship that  existed between our heroines - Johnnie Mae and Pearl - entirely satisfying.   It wanders and at times mimics - poorly - Toni Morrison, but Clarke's work  here is promising enough to warrant a reading of any further work she may  produce.	2000-01-21

I would have thought that a lot of people would have already read this book considering &quot;The Book Of Ruth&quot; was a previous selection.  Anyway besides that I think  there has to be other authors out there with books worthy of being chosen.   Surely choosing different authors benefits not only more readers but more  authors and isn't that the whole purpose of a book club.  I note too that  there are some very good young authors out and about at the moment - note  Suneeta Peres Da Costa - that could very well provide new and different,  and I stress that word, reading experiences.<br />Anyway I have two major  problems with Jane Hamilton's &quot;A Map Of The World&quot;.  The first is  the character of Howard.  He is totally unconvincing and yet should form  the base, the foundation of the novel.  Instead we are given a story about  this woman - Alice - who is thrown so abruptly into this mess of a  depression that there is no time for Howard and hence no time for us as  readers to connect with him.  The second problem I have is the whole sexual  abuse case.  It too is unconvincing and should not have formed a part of  the story.  This is a real shame because Jane Hamilton is a very talented  writer and in fact I am surprised that she has allowed these two pretty  major problems go unmended.  There is still a lot to like about this book,  I'm just waiting however for Jane Hamilton's masterpiece.  I know she has  one in her.	1999-12-04

It is at once compelling, bizarre, beautiful and at times scary. A truly visceral read, she manages to create images which gradually eat away at your mind like rust on an old  car.

The characters are interesting and the plotline intriguing.  What goes wrong though is the introduction of Dolarhyde to the  reader.  I don't think it worked at all.  As he was developed he lost his  menace and the ludicrous ending is like something from a B-grade movie.   The use of abuse as a reason too for Dolarhyde's activities was cliched and  predictable.  I don't know if it was just my copy but there were so many  typos in it by about the thirtieth chapter i'd lost count.  It is the  latest edition too which seems really bizarre.  Could have and probably  should have been better than it is.  Let's hope Silence of the Lambs proves  to be a little bit better.	1999-10-23

You need more than interesting characters to make a good book and while I may be being a little generous in saying that some of the characters were interesting I am not going to be when it  comes to describing her writing.  In parts her writing is really poor and  amateurish and would suggest that the editor got a little bored while  reading through.  I know I did at times.  The only thing to take from this  book is the relationship that develops between a mother and a son.  The  relationship between mother and daughter is okay but nowhere as good as  that that exists between Brian and Ria.  If that is the only reason though  to read it I would steer clear.

A strange storyline,  stranger characters and an ending that is flawed but satisfying, Mother Of  Pearl shows what an imagination can hold.  There are times when the text  seems disjointed and perhaps they need to fix up the typos before it is  reprinted but besides that Mother Of Pearl is a ripper of a book.  A book  that challeneges and in doing so evokes wonderful images.  A book that  sweeps you along much like the creek that soon becomes a river.  A book  written by an author that is brave in the way she develops her characters  and in the way she ends their separate stories.

This is a book that I think people will either find endearing or just plain frustrating.  What lies at the heart is a story that is really very interesting but in the hands of Shreve it is one that just doesn't ring  true.  The introduction of each of the characters is hurried and while the  telling of the story in a non-linear fashion with flashback does provide  insight, one would wonder why we were not given at least some sort of  introduction to Kathryn at the start of the story.  Sure i get that we are  told the story as it unfolds for Kathryn, the flashbacks are exactly that,  flashbacks of the memories and reminders of Jack, however for a story that  touches on really important issues like infidelity, marriage, sex etc. it  answers no questions.  The dialogue that exists between the characters is  also questionable.  Whoever heard a mother talk to their fifteen year old  daughter the way Kathryn talks to Mattie and especially after Jack has just  died?  In fact the only moving scene in the book i think is the  conversation between Kathryn and Deirdre and she is four!  This is  disappointing, very disappointing.	1999-06-01

Not that it worried me.  In fact this proved to be of benefit as this meant that I could read a book  at the same time as it was supposed to be and not the two months later when  it actually arrived on our shores. The reason I think that it has done so  well here is not so much that it is about the Holocaust but more so that as  people we are fascinated and intrigued and are constantly looking for some  sort of understanding of why we do the horrible things we do to each other.   This is is why I think what the &quot;The Reader&quot; sets out to do and  what it actually  involves is not so much the telling of the people of the  Holocaust but those looking back on it.  To read statements further down  this page by people who haven't even READ the book troubles me as it would  seem to me that this idea that &quot;The Reader&quot; is set in or is  predominantly about the Holocaust is being pedalled.  Those reading this  review please understand that it is not.  In fact it will be interesting to  see when they make the movie - and you know they will - whether they focus  on the love story or the courtroom angle.  This is a lovely little story  told in a very big way.  Sure there are some times when you can really see  that this has been translated with some inappropriately short sentences,  but once you get past it you'll find like I did, I'm sure, that &quot;The  Reader&quot; is a story about us as people and not so much the Holocaust.	1999-03-04

It's been about a month since I finished reading &quot;Midwives&quot; and unlike many of the other reviewers I have practically forgotten everything about the book.  Where some have seen an absolutely heart-wrenching tale of  family suffering and the bond that keeps them together in the face of  hardship, I found only a marginal sense of anything.  Where some found a  tightly written courtroom drama that kept you guessing I found an ordinary,  repetitious did-she, didn't she tale.  Don't get me wrong, I think  &quot;Midwives&quot; is an okay read but not a masterpiece as some would  proclaim it. And to read some of the reviews that identify that a reader  has proclaimed it as anything like &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; shows  what people will do to get their name and place of work on the front or  back cover of a book.  Besides the fact that &quot;Midwives&quot; centres  on a young female character and incorporates a court scene,  &quot;Midwives&quot; is nothing like &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot;. How  could one even consider relating a modern masterpiece to this mediocre  tale?  What sets them apart is the difference in the ability to accurately  and sincerely convey the feelings of a young girl.  Continually I had to  remind myself that Connie was only in her early teens and not in her  mid-twenties, and as for Sybil well how much more one-dimensional can you  get?  The characters in &quot;Midwives&quot; are nothing like those in  &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; and unfortunately are what let this story  down.  Sure it is an interesting concept and one that probably should be  investigated in this day and age - I can see that midwives might be  threatened but I don't think that this is particularly a negative portrayal  of midwifery - but it is just that it needs to be done with more fervor and  a better sense of what needs to be said and what doesn't.	1999-03-04

What struck me about 'Where The Heart Is' once I had finished it was that this was a book written by an excellent storyteller not an excellent writer.  Letts creates a wonderful central character - Novalee is perhaps  one of the most likeable female characters I've encountered in a book in  the last couple of years - who struggles and triumphs, yet it's the  struggles that kind of let the book down.  Never have I known one single  person to encounter so much tragedy.  Perhaps this shows the luck and  circumstance that surrounds the people I know, I don't know, but it was  this slight slip from reality that let Novalee's story down.  This is a  real shame because it does appear that Letts meant well, but perhaps a more  experienced eye peering over the shoulder could have set her straight.  The  characters however are cleverly drawn - perhaps there are too many,  inexperience again - and the surroundings appropriately real, yet these are  disappointingly let down by Letts' lack of experience in the writing of a  novel.  This could have been wonderful but as it is 'Where The Heart Is' is  just good.  A pleasant read for a weekend in or even a weekend away.	1999-01-17

The thing that struck me first after finishing Where The Heart Is is that this is a story told by a brilliant storyteller not a brilliant writer.  The book is amateuish and labours in parts but it tells a story that at its  heart is utterly moving.  An extraordinary main character, Novalee Nation,  pushes you to read on and guides you through the trials and tribulations  that she encounters.  The storyline on occasion stretches credibility but  you are so endeared to Novalee that you just want to make sure that she  ends up okay.

I really wanted to like this book more than I ended up liking it but the truth is it just plain irritated me.  I am so sick and tired of reading books to find once I've started that really all they are are drafts for  movie scripts.  It's like these authors Oprah are choosing are just trying  to write something that will get them a whole lot of money when it is made  into a movie.  In this case What Looks Like Crazy... started off so slowly  and then worked its way up to an incredibly interesting climax I thought  wow this one is going to be different but ultimately I ended up  disappointed.  Cleage just ends the story straight after the climax - just  like a movie - and here the reader is left just startled.  It is like  Cleage just got bored with the story and thought okay as long as it is out  there someone will find it - in this case Oprah - and it will be made into  a movie, hence the incredibly long and ultimately stupid title.

Still it was enough to make me want to find and read Jane  Hamilton's other books.	1998-10-20

The workmate  was female so it is possibly why she liked it more than I did.  I finished  and thought I must have missed reading some pages because I was left  wondering.  It was funny, sad and I guess insightful but a book of the  year?  I don't know about that.	1998-10-20

What a boring and self-pitying character Beth is.  I don't know I just  wanted more.  Maybe it's the male in me but I felt the same about Fran in  Black And Blue.  Vincent is a much more convincing character.  If you read  Mitchard's second book, The Most Wanted, then maybe you'll come to the same  conclusion I have: Mitchard writes really convincing young people,  something not many other authors do, and something that perhaps she should  stick to.  The Most Wanted is better but still flawed, so if you like Deep  End of the Ocean then make sure you read it too.	1998-10-20

And that is all it is really: a little story  in a big book.  And that is the reason it doesn't get five.  Mary McGarry  Morris writes very well, developing the characters extremely well, making  us understand, question and then accept their actions and motives but it is  too long.  Perhaps about 100-150 pages too long there are just a couple of  stages of tedium but if you like Maeve Binchy then you'll like Songs In  Ordinary Time.	1998-10-15

She really  does.  I liked the way she told the story from both perspectives, it was  both honest and moving.  What a charmer!	1998-10-13

After all the hullabaloo about it  on Oprah's show I was expecting some mini mastepiece.  Unfortunately it is  not that.  It's still pretty good though, just not as good as A Virtuous  Woman or as good as they say.	1998-10-13

As a young white Australian male living on the  complete opposite side of the world from where Ms Morrison lives and  writes, it was with apprehension that I picked up one of her books for the  first time.  It was Song of Solomon.  That was May of 1997 and  I have read  that book three times since then.  So, when Oprah chose Toni Morrison's new  book as one of her bookclub selections I went looking straight away.  I  wasn't disappointed.  I know some others who have read the book and hated  it and then I saw the Oprah show where everyone didn't get it and I just  sat there dumbfounded.  I love the way Ms Morrison tells about the chivalry  and friendship between this group of women.  What was there not to get?  And what was all this business about white and black?  Who cares?  It isn't  the point of the book.  I love Paradise as a book and I love it as a title.  Paradise?  Oh yes it is.	1998-10-13

After the first chapter of this lovely little book my immediate reaction  was &quot;Oh no!  Oprah's given us another 'oh the poor women' story, but  by the end i was totally won over.  Danticat loves the women, you can tell  by the way she treats them.  Even when you can see that their actions are  flawed and almost verge on pathetic, this sense of 'I can understand her  doing that' floats gently back into your mind and then BAM! hits you square  in the face.  And if the last page of this book is not the best I have read  in a while then I just do not have a clue.	1998-09-19

The  cover in Australia is different to the one shown above and all I can say is  what a pity you can't see it!  From  the structured way the girl's face is  painted to the almost Virginal-Mary way she stands with the baby in her  arms this cover is the best I have ever seen.  But don't they tell you to  never judge a book by its cover?  Well let me tell you they're wrong here.   This is extraordinary.  Never once does Reynolds preach to us in telling  her story which I would imagine must have been one of the hardest things to  do.  I love the characters by the end, even the poor ol' misguided grandpa  figure.  From the opening sentence to the very last paragraph where she  separates her tiny baby's hands I was enthralled.  We are lucky Downunder  that Oprah selected this book, otherwise an extraordinary author in Miss  Reynolds would have gone completely unnoticed, unimagined and unheard.	1998-09-19
