US	52441598	RKMLJ0ONG8054	0060930004	524429774	The Distinguished Guest	Books	3	5	5	N	N	A Strong Character Study	Sue Miller is a powerful writer, and although this isn't her most stimulating novel it still has enough to recommend it.<br />Lily Maynard finds celebrity in her 70's as she writes her memoirs. She and her former husband Paul ran a church that was heavily involved in the early civil rights movement, and it was this involvement that ended their marriage. Lily enjoys her late-in-life fame, but now Parkinson's Disease is forcing her into a retirement home, and as she waits for a unit to become available she moves in with her son Alan and his French wife Gaby.<br />Lily's relationship with Alan has always been strained, as Alan has 'issues' with his strong-willed mother. These issues come to the forefront as they live together, and as Lily begins to deteriorate. Added to the mix is a writer doing an article about Lily, who brings up issues long-buried and best forgotten.<br />The novel is a strong character study of these characters: Lily, Alan and his wife and sons, and the lonely free-lance writer. Secrets, (none too shocking) are eventually revealed and issues resolved, but don't expect much in the way of plot or action.  Just enjoy Miller's skill at creating these characters and bringing them to life.	2003-12-11

I was afraid this was one of them, but the longer I stuck with it the more I enjoyed and admired this surprising tale. The language, which seemed stilted at first, became natural in both the appropriateness of the time period and the quirks of the characters.<br />The last thing I expected from this story of unrequited love was a feminist slant, but the Virginia Woolf aspect of the story is very well conceived. Stuffy Professor Nicholas Van Tassel is not a monster, but a prim and proper man of his generation. He reacts to what he perceives as his wife's betrayal in a despicable manner, but probably not much differently than other men of that time would have. We never get much into the head of his unhappy wife, Etna, who keeps her secrets from the reader as well as from her clueless husband.<br />Shreve has taken a chance writing a period novel featuring some unlikeable characters, and I think succeeds admirably with the material.	2003-10-08

Even the author, who I met and heard speak in May 2002, has trouble describing her unusual set-up. It's about opera (of which she knew nothing when she started writing the book) and hostages, a most unusual combination. Yet Anne Patchett controls the story like a well-rehersed symphony. And yes, as the action unfolds it becomes less a political treatise and more of a love story.<br />The characters are extremely well-drawn, from the ineffectual Vice-President to the selfless priest to the twitchy terrorists, mostly ordinary men and clueless teenagers who find themselves stuck in a no-win situation. Unlikely relationships form and love blooms in spite of impossible barriers of language and nationality.<br />And if the ending seems a bit tacked on, know that the author assued me that true love reigns.  And she should know!	2002-06-12

She skillfully interweaves the story of middle-aged Cath, at a crossroads in her life and trying to decide which path to travel, and Cath's grandmother Georgia. Using Georgia's diaries, Cath pieces together stories her grandmother told her with the diary's cryptic entries, and eventually she understands the events that shaped her grandmother's destiny.<br />Both stories are equally well-told, but the tale of Georgia's days in a sanitarium recovering from TB, a deadly disease in those days, is especially fascinating. The sanitarium was its own world, and people whose time may have been short made their own rules. <br />I just met Sue Miller and found out that she based much of this story on her own grandmother's diaries. Readers that enjoy contemporary fiction from thoughtful authors such as Anne Tyler or Elizabeth Berg will surely love this novel.	2001-10-30

The narrator did a terrific job, but I still didn't enjoy it as much as the original. Bridget is such a ninny that at times she becomes downright annoying. She's hopeless at her job, chronically late, and insistant on listening to advice from girlfriends who steer her in the absolutely wrong direction.  She gives a builder who she knows does terrible work money to do a major job (and ends up with nothing more than a hole in her wall), gets a plum interview with Colin Firth (a wink-wink tie-in to the movie), asks him ludicrous questions and then can't get it together to actually write the article she's contracted for, and that's not even mentioning her adventures in Thailand.<br />I also don't think her character was consistant in regards to Mark Darcy. A girl like Bridget wouldn't have let him simply drift away after a misunderstanding, but would have probably plagued him with phone calls. Surely one of her self-help books would have instructed her not to give up on the relationship so easily.<br />There are funny bits, however, such as Bridget surviving prison by teaching the inmates Madonna songs. The book is set up for another sequel - I just hope this time she isn't such a twit.	2001-10-11

How wonderful to have John Dortmunder back in action, and in a book that is absolutely up to par with his best adventures. And after five years without a new Dortmunder, it's fun to read one that feels current, with the Internet and cell phones as part of the story. The whole gang is back - May, Andy Kelp, Tiny Bulcher, Stan Murch and even Stan's cab-driving mom, once again pulling off her helpless little old lady routine with aplumb.<br />This time they're forced to work with outsiders, and initially in the humiliating role of grave robbers after Dortmunder's latest caper, a mall camera-heist, goes sour. But John rightly doesn't trust his new employers, and he soon goes from &quot;bozo&quot; to partner, finding a way to weasel himself and Andy in on the action. <br />The pace is fast, the plot twists inventive, and the writing smooth as ever. Even if you've never read Westlake, you'll jump right in, and the good news is you'll get a kick out of Bad News.	2001-07-19
US	52441598	R3BVPEWJJT2NAF	0679463127	133893239	The Dearly Departed	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Light and Fluffy	Lipman's newest novel is so light and fluffy the words may float off the pages. This is not necessarily a bad thing, especially with a novelist like Lipman, who knows how to create appealing, identifiable characters. The novel's theme is not as heavy as her last book, &quot;The Inn at Lake Devine&quot;, which dealt with anti-semitism. Even though the center of this story concerns the death of two people, the tone is kept humorous and the protagonist, Sunny's grief is handled with the same light touch as the rest of the novel.<br />It's all rather pat, from Sunny's relationship with her newly discovered smart-aleck brother to her relationship with an old schoolmate, now the Andy Taylorish chief of police. But we like the characters and we like this book, which is a perfect summer read.	2001-07-10

It has an interesting premise and a very catchy ending, but there are too many problems in the writing for me to give it a strong recommendation. The author is trying to make parallels between the life of her protagonist, Isabel Latimer, and Isabel's writing (she specializes in high-toned fiction about moral choices). Now, of course, Isabel has a moral choice to make. What will she do?<br />Unfortunately, she drags out the story and the point of view from which the story is told isn't consistant. The writing ranges from very good to downright trashy. When the story goes into somewhat deviant sex scenes it just gets silly. There are also holes in the story that a truck could be driven through (a man puts on woman's clothes and makeup in ten minutes, and fools an entire television studio. Yeah, right).<br />It was interesting enough to keep me reading, but was a lost opportunity for what could have been a boffo story.	2001-03-15

That was almost bothersome at first; that someone so young could enter the personas of middle-aged men of two different nationalities, and that she could do it with such confidence. <br />If this isn't quite a 5-star novel, it is still an amazingly accomplished debut. It's literary, has depth of character and purpose of plot, and wraps up with a smooth and satisfying ending. <br />Mary Higgins Clark and Danielle Steel readers probably won't like it; this novel takes a little work and persistance. If this is her debut goodness knows what her next endevour will be. She's definately a writer to watch.	2001-02-26

Author Joanne Martel does a terrific job of not only telling Millie-Christine's story, but also of detailing the world she lived in.<br />Much more interesting than the original Siamese twings Chang and Eng, her life crossed theirs and they even exhibited together for a time. Why their story survived in popular culture and hers is largely lost is a mystery. This is a remarkable story.	2001-01-21

His superlative performance is astonishing, capturing completely the nuances of every character, from nasty Malfoy to comforting Dumbledore, even imbueing minor characters like Almost Headless Nick and Peeves the Ghost with distinct personalities.<br />My husband was so hooked on this 12-tape set that he listened for almost an entire 8-hour airplane flight, missing two in-flight movies. This is the most intense of the Potter series, and I don't have to add to the raves it has received. Listening to the story, however, is an entirely different experience than reading the book. Even if you've read the Potter books before they are worth a listen. Jim Dale narrates all four books, and he continues to marvel.	2000-11-09
US	52441598	R20XXN3ZBFAZRY	0385333927	951729133	Pagan Babies	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Classic Leonard	Detroit's own &quot;Dutch&quot; Leonard is back in classic form with Pagan Babies. It flows like a river - just jump in and ride the current! The characters are classic Leonard, too. Priest (or is he?) Terry Dunn is sharper than he seems, and convict/comedianne Debby may be dumber. Even the supporting characters crackle - from Terry's knowing sister-in-law and trusting brother to Debby's shark of an ex-husband. The dialogue sizzles, too. Pagan Babies doesn't suffer from some of the problems I've found in Leonard's non-Detroit stories.  He seems most at home writing about Detroit and those novels are certainly his most self-assured. Being a Detroiter, I may be prejudiced (he loads the novel with specific local locations), but I loved this book!	2000-10-30

It's a  great story, with a mystery at its core that keeps the reader enthralled  until the final page is turned. The central mystery and its spiraling  ramifications keep building until the conclusion.  Very tough stuff for a  new author to master.  It has &quot;Oprah book&quot; written all over it!	2000-09-07

This earlier title did not appeal to me as much, although I enjoyed  it more towards the end of the story. The other two titles seemed simpler  and yet somehow more complete and less contrived. Perhaps its just the  growth of the author's talents.<br />It did seem a bit much that suddenly,  after living as the rector's wife for so many years, Anna was both fed up  with her life and attracting the attention of multiple men. She barely  interacted with Patrick, the rich city man who decides he's mad about  her.<br />However, I did enjoy the descriptions of English country life and  applauded Anna's meager attempts to break the ties that bound her. The fury  over her taking a job at a supermarket is priceless. One of Trollope's  strongest suits is the way all of her character's actions affect their  entire families.  As in life, all decisions have fallout, and Trollope is a  master at making that clear. Not her best, but worth a read.	2000-06-15

The ones included don't illustrate the story very well - we want to SEE the main players in  Garland's life, including all of her husbands. <br />Judy does not come across  as a likeable woman. She is spoiled, difficult, resolutely drug addicted,  and unreliable. Yet Clarke lets us sympathize and understand the reasons  for her temperment. Her family life was a disaster, MGM did its best to  make her chronically insecure, and her astounding talent was never enough  to make her like much about herself. Her questionable taste in men (Minelli  wore makeup; Sid Luft was a bully and a thug, most of them were undeniably  gay)makes on wonder.<br />Not as good as Clarke's book on Capote, but Garland  fans will find it fascinating.	2000-05-22

I could picture both characters: Tight-lipped Isabelle and Amy hiding behind her voluminous hair. I felt it was quite believable - Isabelle hiding a secret that she  doesn't realize isn't nearly as shocking as she has thought, and Amy's fear  of the world reflecting her mother's. Amy is just the type of girl who  would be easily seduced by an authority figure like a teacher. Although  they may not be the most likeable characters in the world, they certainly  are interesting.  I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and look forward to her  next outing.	2000-03-22

I found myself reading it slowly, not wanting it to end.  Richard and Theresa are not your usual protagonists.  Richard is depressed, self-absorbed, and afraid of  life.  Theresa takes responsibility for the world and is impossible to get  along with.  Yet I found myself rooting for them, wanting these misplaced  people to find their place in the world.<br />And as a person who loves thrift  shops and yard sales, I delighted in the author's obvious love of junk.  Zadoorian waxes philosophical about the appeal of the secondhand, the  thrill of the hunt.  Little did I know how much meaning there was in junk!  And of course, the fact that the action takes place in my own backyard,  geographically speaking, made it all the more fun to read. A most promising  debut.	2000-03-22

Shreve strays from her contemporary novels to write a turn-of-the-century romance, complete with all the anguish of a  woman facing her limited choices in life. Shreve tries to portray the  flavor of the times by using period dialogue, which works well once the  reader gets accustomed to it. Although the book's ending is a bit pat, I  for one was glad it ended as it did.  Shreve can get rather gloomy.  This  was a nice change of pace, and Shreve knows just how to hook the reader  with everything she writes.	2000-03-15

The author assumes that the reader has a certain amount of knowledge, and this  can be frustrating if you don't. I also recommend watching the movie  MICHAEL COLLINS with Liam Neeson, which covers the same historical events  as the book. Together they give a fairly complete picture of this period of  Irish history.<br />HENRY isn't my favorite Doyle title, but it has his usual  scintillating writing. This is a tough story about a scrappy lad in a nasty  time in Irish history. Worth reading.	1999-12-31

Piercy does a marvelous job of entering the minds of three woman of different generations and captures them perfectly.  I especially appreciated the portraits of women who had children, but perhaps  shouldn't have and realize it. Not many writers will acknowledge that  motherhood is not for everyone.

I had just finished Alice Hoffman's &quot;Local Girls&quot;, which also uses a linked short-story format, and Banks' novel was the better of the two. <br />This  format does tend to sacrifice a bit in the way of character development and  consistancy. For instance, it never does explain Jane's attraction for  Archie, her much older and impotent boyfriend. And the chapter on breast  cancer is a bit baffling. But I enjoyed Jane's witticisms, clever turns of  phrases, and especially her grappling with the ridiculous rules of romance.	1999-07-20

Magnuson does a great job of having his main character, Ben, agonize over the questions  we'd all ask when trying to hide illicit funds. How does an honest man  launder money? When will the bad guys show up? How do I find a way to make  this money improve, and not ruin my life?<br />The tension is high, and I  finally gave up trying to read it in bed and finished the novel during the  day. I just couldn't get to sleep after a session with this story!  It's  not Shakespeare, but it surely was an entertaining and thought-provoking  rollercoaster of a novel.	1999-06-29

The reader did the best she could with the incredibly cornball dialogue and trite descriptions, but it was still barely tolerable. <br />If I heard the words &quot;Little Bear  Lake&quot; and &quot;Robert Flaubert&quot; one more time I would have  screamed. Who told the author that constant repetition was a GOOD thing?   Somehow she must have the idea that it is somehow romantic to constantly  repeat names and places.<br />Not only is the story trite and predictable, but  the bigger than life protagonist and his idolicized dead father are  annoying as hell. If Robbie was so perfect then why on earth did Maggie  dump him? And the wize words that come out of 25-year-old Elliot's mouth  are ludicrous. Quoting the Great Gatsby?

But that aside,  the novel is an absorbing, fascinating look into a vanished world.<br />Who  knew that there were actual geisha districts with hundreds of geishas, or  that they were often children sold into the life? That, with all its  ceremony and beauty, the geishas were often no more than slaves with no  control over their own lives?

I had an opportunity to speak with Tami Hoag recently and found her to be friendly and funny. But I wasn't bowled over by this latest book. If you like this sort of thing I guess it was fairly well written, but the gore  was really excessive and the characters only mildly involving. I don't see  the need to describe the brutalization of women in such detail.<br />On the  other hand, I didn't guess the identity of the &quot;Cremator&quot;, and  there were enough surprises to make it interesting.

While the author has her moments, I reached the conclusion that she just isn't that great a writer. She certainly lacks something in the  character-development department.<br />I'll give it this much, though, the  book held my interest. There's always something intriguing about stories  that gives clues in the present to what occurred in the past. But the  characters just didn't hold up. The Ya-Ya's behavior, especially as  children and teenagers, was too unrealistic. Well-raised Catholic southern  girls of their era didn't raise hell in public, or bath naked together as  teenagers. <br />And the character of Sidda was too exasperating for words.  She couldn't marry the man of her dreams because she &quot;didn't know what  love is&quot;.  Give me a break!!  And if I read one more sentence about  these woman boozing it up...<br />It's a promising story that could have been  much better in other hands.

Although the prose was tight and the slightly mocking tone of the narrator was fun, neither the story nor the characters  quite jelled for me.<br />There were also too many unanswered questions  regarding the ending. Where would an isolated, world-famous composer find a  murderous doctor in another country?  Perhaps it would be easier for the  newspaper editor, but with his name splashed all over the media one would  think that he would have trouble making this illicit contact also. It was  all too pat and rather rushed, like McEwan just wanted to get it over  with.<br />Worth reading, but not memorable.	1999-02-16

I love  novels that teach as well as entertain. Missionaries don't fare  particularly well, which may irritate some readers, but those that share  the view that it takes a certain arrogance to tell a people that their  centuries-old way of worship is wrong will applaud that sentiment  here.<br />An emotional journey.	1999-02-09

The comforting lilt of a good British reader, the coziness of Pilcher's idealized Cornwall, the everything-always  -works-out-in-the-endness of her novels. <br />Nothing extraordinary, but  comforting as an old shoe.	1999-01-28

This is a masterpiece, with dead-on characterizations, no-holds-barred satire and discussion-provoking  social commentary.<br />Just the characters' names alone are priceless -  Raymond Peepgas, Roger Too White, and Charlie Croker among them. Everyone  is knocked here: the ego-inflated developer, the social climbing lawyer,  the trophy wife, the pampered athlete. Sentences are worth reading two and  three times to digest their full wonderfulness. No one can turn a phrase  like Wolfe.<br />Okay, the ending seems a little rushed. But events tie  together in satisfying fashion, and I for one was sorry to see the novel  end, even after 741 pages. It's the Great American Novel of the decade.	1999-01-11

There's not a challenging moment in this novel. He also seems  entranced by horrifically brutal murders, many of children. While this may  bring readers, it also has a gratuitous and unnecessary feeling.<br />It's a  quick read - fine if you're looking for something that won't tax your brain  beyond the average episode of &quot;Matlock&quot;.	1998-12-29

Estleman really knows how to  capture the mood and feeling of a time period. His war-time Detroit seems  dead-on, and as a resident I enjoyed the references to streets and places  in the city. The novel was also informative - I hadn't known that there was  a race riot during the war years, and the information about the war effort  at the auto plants was fascinating.<br />My main criticism would be the  characters of the cops. They didn't stand out as individual personalities,  and I didn't get involved with them as I do with Elmore Leonard's novels.   However, fans of Leonard could do worse than reading &quot;Jitterbug&quot;  and other Estleman novels.	1998-12-12

She is only partially  successful, and although she is  a compulsively readable author &quot;Baby  Girl&quot; is Flagg's weakest novel.<br />The novel is at its strongest when  Flagg does what she does best, traveling back to small town southern life.  Her flashbacks to Neighbor Dorothy and her corny, homespun radio show are  priceless. Modern day Elmwood Springs and its inhabitants are also  enjoyable.  Unfortunately. the novel sags with its main character, the  unlovable Dena. I never warmed up to this cold fish, and the too-pat  wrap-up was simply sappy.<br />That said, I'd still grab Flagg's next effort  and hope some of the magic of her earlier novels returns.	1998-10-26

Lipman's novels are light and humerous, and here she manages to  say a lot in a thoroughly readable,enoyable way. Her details are right on  (if you've ever been to a Catskills resort in the 60's you'll have to  agree). And if the ending is a bit fluffy? It's just what's called for.

The dense political  commentary is clearly and vividly read and may actually be more interesting  than in text form.<br />While I, too, got ansy to get back to the story of  Liddie and Thomas, I was also gratified to receive an education on the  tangled history of Kansas/Missouri relations. I had no idea that this was  part of our country's history.<br />Liddie's narrative was so genuine (and  obviously well-researched)that I often forgot it was fiction. The details  of homesteading, steamboat travel, and pioneer life are outstanding. The  only reason for not awarding 5 stars is the proponderence of political  detail, which was a bit of overkill. Still, historical fiction readers will  not want to miss this one.	1998-10-12

I saw Reeve on numerous tv interviews promoting this book and was afraid I'd be saturated before I read it.  But it was still worth reading as a scary, inspirational, and fascinating look at how life can change in the blink of an eye.<br />One thing that impressed me in his interviews is how honest Reeve and his wife Dana are. This honesty comes through in the book, and Chris pulls no punches describing the horror, depression, and physical trials he must endure. He doesn't spout platitudes, but frankly expresses his feelings of getting a raw deal that he just must live with.<br />I was a fan of Reeve's back in his soap opera days and always followed his career with interest. I'll be applauding the loudest the day he gets up and walks.  And if he never does he's still a talented, courageous man who has so much to offer the world.	1998-07-01

Judy always knew how to hook a reader and this adult novel doesn't disappoint. The story of two very different friends and their journey into adulthood flows right along.

I was never a Garland fan, cringing at her neuroses every time I saw her, but my dad is nuts about her. You don't have to be a fan to find the story fascinating. Luft has great sadness and sympathy for the dilema her mother found herself in, and freely admits that the legacy of addiction continued with all Garland's children.<br />Even Luft's own story is interesting, from the party years at Studio 54 to her involvement with her sister Liza, up until Lorna finally pulls herself and her life together. Sometimes there seems to be some name-dropping and a bit of envy there, but if the Rolling Stones were at YOUR wedding, heck, you'd talk about it too!	1998-07-01

This memoir reads like novel, and it's funny, knowing, honest and touching. Laura, or &quot;Lily&quot;, lives with her young mother in the Bronx. All she knows of her father is that he's fighting in the war, even though it takes a while for her to realize that WWII is long over. Her mother is vastly relived when the Korean War begins so her story makes sense once more. When her mom dies young, Lily lives with her two eccentric uncles and her addled Russian grandmother. Their oddball family is hilarious, and begs the question of what really makes up a family.<br />I can picture this as a terrific movie and wonder why no one has discovered it yet. Do yourself a favor and seek out this loving tribute. My sister-in-law lent it to me after a friend lent it to her. It's one of those pass-around novels.	1998-07-01

Barnaby is another great Tyler creation. His natural sense of goodness won't allow him to forgive himself for the missteps of his youth, and his insensitive, insecure mother continually rubs salt in the wound.<br />When Barnaby meets his &quot;angel&quot; Sophia, his family hopes he is finally 'settling down'. What they fail to realize is that Barnaby is the most settled of them all, a trustworthy guy who works at un underpaid job that truly helps people.  But he has few material things and no appreciation for their values. They can't see past his threadbare clothes, basement apartment, and lack of ambition. They can't forgive him or appreciate him, and he therefore can't appreciate or forgive himself. As the story progresses Barnaby takes a journey of self-awareness and forgiveness.<br />I was sorry to leave these characters. Another fine turn for Anne Tyler.	1998-05-26

Does it exactly express the emotions of a gay 15 year old boy or a 38 year old man? Do 15 year old boys swoon over opera singers or play guessing games with classical music? It hardly matters, as the writing is crisp, the emotions seem genuine and the plot is absorbing.

This doesn't always happen in slice of life stories.	1998-05-20

The message is the plowing under of natural, swampy Floria into a land of look-alike strip malls and condo development. The silliness involves some overdrawn characters and dumb rather than clever situations, such as the police continuing to doubt that a terrorist group is at work even after several murders.  Hiaasen takes this plot point one more step too far by having the police accuse one of their own of faking the terrorist attacks, which becomes just, well, silly. <br /> Overall, however, this is amusingly fun fare (although there are some innocents murdered) and Hiaasen makes his point while providing giggles.	1998-04-22

With a bit too much repetition, she does her best to explain why a bright, loving woman like Fran would stay with Bobby, the sexy, macho cop who becomes a monster. <br /> I would have liked more detail as to how the conclusion of the novel was reached.

Although his writing is as crisp and readable as ever, his plot is paper-thin and less than exciting. This one reminded me of &quot;The Chamber&quot; - lots of preaching about the evils of the death penalty and very little action. Here Grisham gets on the band-wagon for the homeless, but the hohum plot and characterizations make the sermonizing stand out like a banner.  I swore I'd never read another Grisham after being bored to tears by &quot;The Chamber&quot;, and this confirms my suspicions that the guy only had a few really good stories in him.	1998-03-21

I wasn't even sure whether author Naumoff likes women or dispises them.  He pities them to be sure.  All the relationships in the book are off balance, and even Louise and Walter, the May-December couple who initially adore each other, undergo a change that taints their relationship and makes them as unsettling as the other couples we meet.  <br /> Naumoff is a fine writer, and I'd be interested to see what he does with other material. It is always interesting when a man writes from a woman's perspective.  This one is skewed at best.	1998-03-21

In the world of Dorothea May and her husband's cousins, the carefully measured world of sheltered people over the age of seventy, the simplest change in their lives is the stuff of high drama.  When Cousin Kitty asks Dorothea to take in the friend of her American granddaughter for a week, Dorothea is severely shaken. The simple act of having a border, and an unobtrusive one at that, is enough to make Dorothea examine her past and current life and decide that some changes are in order. <br /> And yet the changes are infintesimal, small enough to be laughable in less capable hands. But, as usual, Brookner handles them masterfully. This novel contains mostly interior reflection and sometimes seems repetitive, even contradictory And yes, Brookner fans will recognize another aging, lonely, unfulfilled character.  But her words never fail her and Brookner readers will not be disappointed.	1998-02-21

A feast of gratuitous gore, with women being carved up in the most gruesome ways possible added to extremely graphic autopsy scenes were enough to turn me off. I'm not squeamish, but I was neither intrigued nor titilated by all the chopped up body parts. <br /> I didn't find the writing particularly outstanding, and the descriptions of Quebec were merely tiresome. Maybe I missed something by not sticking with it, but I was disappointed in this debut outing.	1998-02-06

Ruth went &quot;over to the black side&quot;, as the author calls it, because that was where she found the only unconditional love and acceptance she'd ever known. Born of an extremely disfunctional family, with a cruel, abusive father and an ineffectual mother, Ruth's first boyfriend and most of her friends and neighbors were black. Ruth found emotional shelter in the black world in spite of the prejudice of the era and the difficulty surrounding her choice. <br /> I enjoyed the alternating chapters, told from both the author's and Ruth's perspectives. However, I never felt I really knew Ruth, never learned why she had so many children, how she coped with their poverty, what toll the loss of her birth family had on her. And James' narrative felt incomplete at times, also. But the strength of this story stands on its own, and overcomes any dificiency in the telling. It's a unique life that is worth visiting.	1998-02-06

The Morrie he rediscovers still has spirit, intelligence and compassion in spite of the ALS which is stealing his life by degrees.  <br /> This slim volume is full of platitudes, most of which we've read before, but they do have an added weight coming from a man who is tetering so close to death. If this weren't a true tale it would be a smaltzy, even hackneyed story, but its veracity makes it heart-rending. Albom couldn't have written a more moving tribute to a pretty special guy.	1998-01-13

It is the early 1950's, when towns still had one blinker light, one gas station and a general store, and were peopled with religious yet often hypocritical citizens. <br /> Into this setting comes Jack Umstead, driving up with a stolen Buick 8, an alias, and a well rehearsed plan on how to fleece the good people of Listre. But Jack doesn't count on the resolve of the folks he meets, or the spunk of one old gal with a nasty looking shotgun and a good aim. <br /> &quot;Trouble&quot; took a little while to lure me in.  My liking for the folks of Listre grew slowly, but when it hit I was hooked - I was thoroughly engrossed in their lives and situations.

Or is it a memoir? Along with enumerable tales of dinner seated between the rich and famous Dunne, who had a front row seat for the length of the Simpson trial, unleashes his anger at a system that sentenced his daughter's killer to less than two years in prison.  People talk to Dunne (or his alter ego, Gus Bailey - whoever you choose to believe). Folks not willing to &quot;get involved&quot; in the trial tell him their secrets, be it bloody sheets found in the garbage or Simpson's gift of a bag full of knives. Gus knows things, and soon we are privileged to know them, too. They are gossipy and delicious, and learning these inside stories along with Gus's friends Nancy (Reagan), Liz (Taylor) et.al. gives a vicarious thrill.  <br />  How this frivolity mixes with outrage over the murder (and Dunne's unwavering believe in Simpson's guilt) is a tribute to Dunne's talent. Only a weak and tacked on ending mars Dunne's juggling act. Not Dunne's best work, but certainly one of his most interesting.	1997-12-22

Everest climb that claimed the life of many fellow climbers, including premier guide Rob Hall. Reading this book is a chilling experience, as Krakauer makes the reader feel the physical depletion, mental exhaustion and eventual anguish he felt as he realized the extent of the disaster. <br /> Krakauer makes no excuses for his own part in the tragedy, and leaves the reader questioning if he, or anyone else, could have done more. The larger question of the wisdom of these types of excursions, expensive adventures with under-experienced participants, also comes under scrutiny. <br /> This is a armchair traveler's view of a most harrowing experience, and leaves the reader amazed, fascinated, and enlightened.  Highly recommended.<BR>	1997-12-22
