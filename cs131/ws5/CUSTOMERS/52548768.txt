Shanks gives an adequate rebuttal to the dubious musings of the likes of Dembski, Behe, and Johnson (Johnson's a lawyer, not a scientist).  He starts with a brief history of the origins debate, giving a sound explanation of the earlier argument for design proposed by Paley and others prior to the Darwinian revolution.  As Shanks rightfully concludes, most of the arguments for intelligent design were disposed of by both scientists and philosophers long ago, despite their modern window-dressing and insidious obfuscations.  He then proceeds to document the rise and development of evolutionary theory from the earliest proposals of Darwin and others to modern genetics, medicine, bacteriology and other fields, explaining why the theory is so well-supported by the enormous available evidence.  Following that, he delves into a critique of the recent arguments for intelligent design, specifically the notions of \\"irreducible complexity\\" and the various claims from biochemistry.  Later he covers cosmological considerations such as the big bang.  Finally, he explores the \\"real\\" agenda of the ID movement, specifically the ominous \\"wedge-strategy\\" and the striving for dissolution of the wall of separation of church and state.<br /><br />If you already are convinced that evolution is a sound theory, it may help to read this book simply to have a knowledge of the kinds of proposals that are being proffered as \\"science\\" so that you can effectively handle objections to evolution from this standpoint.  If you are partial to the intelligent design \\"theory\\" then, assuming you will read with an open mind, you will be exposed to a very effective critique.	2005-05-29

While the Elegant Universe focused on the emerging hope of a final unified theory of physics through the \\"little strings\\", this book is a more general presentation of the myriad possibilities that modern physics seeks to understand.  The central concept is the \\"nature of space and time\\" which he introduces through the \\"bucket experiment\\", and continues to develop and refine through the musings of luminaries such as Einstein and Mach.  He then gives eloquent summaries, peppered with numerous non-mathematical analogies, of the well-tested theories of modern physics - general relativity and quantum mechanics.  This is followed up with the latest attempt at the unification of these theories through the notion of string/M theory.  It is at this point that Greene readdresses the ultimate nature of the \\"background\\" of all of these theories - space and time itself.  Now, equipped with M-theory, he discusses what may be coming in the near and far future of physics.  Concepts such as time travel, parallel universes, newly emerging particle accelerators (and their potential to confirm/deny some of the predictions of M-theory), background independence, the idea that space and time itself is atomized/quantized, and the holographic model of spacetime are discussed.<br /><br />This book was an absolute pleasure to read, one that I am sure that anyone who is interested in the deep ideas and possibilities that modern physics implies will be thrilled to experience.  The writing is absolutely stellar, the examples make good intuitive sense, and a sense of wonder is sustained from start to finish.  Absolutely recommended.	2005-05-19

This is a terrific book for those who are interested in a well written and entertaining semi-chronological survey of the story of LSD and the culture/counterculture that it inspired.  Here you will read brief and interesting snippets about every kooky character involved in this extended comedy, which is still being played out in the present day (if you disagree take a hard look at the current American political climate).<br />The evolution of LSD is an epic of weird spies, cult figures, radical politicos, high falutin' intellectuals, right-wing paranoids, fanatical scientists, artists, terrorists, radicals, hippies, yippies, sex-obsessed freaks, and ordinary folk who are interested in sampling a slice of infinity for a few bucks a hit.<br />I would invite you to partake of this experience (of course I only refer to READING THE BOOK) if you are brave, self-assured, and happy.  All others need not apply, but if you feel interest then as the MAN says...Turn off your mind, relax, and float downstream...best wishes and enjoy.	2003-05-26

The free market and the freedom of the individual are an undivided unity.  A planned economy cannot possibly succeed in the long term no matter how lofty the principles of it's designers.  While many in the world still violently disagree with this thesis, the historical evidence of the 20th century beginning with World War I makes it plain that Hayek was correct.  Now that the communist world has (nearly) completely collapsed, it seems ironic that the most vocal opponents of the free market reside in the free market nations.  We can only hope that their particular brand of insanity is not contagious.	2002-04-25

The book covers the myriad aspects of &quot;the trip&quot; from perceptions of the human body to the deep religious experience.<br />The book is somewhat more scholarly than the works of someone like Timothy Leary but this is what is needed if this movement is to ever regain its legitimacy in the eyes of the general public.  While it does not condone the illegal use of the drugs, it decries their suppression and the utter halt of legitimate research into these fascinating and important substances.  Read it with an open mind, but remember that the drugs are illegal and therefore also potentially dangerous.  That aside, the book will almost certainly spark your curiousity.	2001-10-22

Mowat is sent north to observe the wolf in his natural habitat to determine if the wolf is responsible for the disastrous decline of the caribou population. In so doing he discovers the wolf to be far from the &quot;savage brute&quot; that he expected. In studying a family of these creatures he presents a unique and beautiful picture of natural life. He comes to love the wolves for their purity, their dedication to family, and their intelligence. In addition, there are several fascinating episodes involving the local eskimo peoples, particularly an old and wise man named Ootek.<br />Although it reads like a novel, it is a true account of Mowat's experience. We are fortunate however that such a spirit as his shines through with such clarity in the narrative. Mowat is a writer of great power, worthy of the attention of anyone who is remotely interested in the plight of the natural world against the neverending onslaught by humanity.	2001-08-31

Such was the case with Lt. John F. Kennedy in command of PT 109 in the South Pacific during WWII.  Faced with the alternative of action or death he rose to the occasion and was able to save the lives of his shipmates through great physical trauma and hardship.<br />Without going into the details of the incidents described, I would merely say that this is a good example of what the best of us are capable of doing when forced to think and act or face death.

He has intelligence, knowledge, the ability to think.  However, he also has the unfortunate lot in life of being a hardened criminal.  Without getting into where the blame lies for this tragic waste of human potential, and with the full admission that I have never been arrested, let alone spent time in prison or known anyone who has done so, I have to admit that Abbott failed to persuade me to his point of view.  This is not to say that he is not persuasive in describing America's penal system as an inhumane machine of torture and fear.  It is simply that his proposed solution - that of a worldwide \\"revolt of the masses\\" has failed, as it should have.<br /><br />Abbott describes in excruciating detail the problems of prison life.  He also explores the issues of racism, capital punishment, sexual depravity, violence in society, and other numerous social ills.  Ultimately, he is involved in a long rationalization - how does one survive in a world in which one prefers to be dead?  Abbott himself seems to feel that death is the final insult, the unholiest of possible outcomes.  He is nothing more than a caged animal, guarded by animals.  His is a world of gross injustice and terrifying irrationalism - the world of the brute.<br /><br />In spite of the obvious sensitivity he demonstrates, in the end I had little sympathy and a great many problems with his opinions.  Does the fact that I have never been to prison disqualify me from having an opinion?  We can only hope for a world where we are all \\"disqualified\\" from having such opinions, because the world that is Abbott's is nothing more than Hell on earth.	2001-07-28

In Anna Karenina he examines the central problem of life through two distinct lenses - Anna, whose discontent is acknowledged in the affair with the dashing Vronsky, and Konstantin, also disillusioned, at first spurned, and later rewarded for accepting what seem to be Tolstoy's views of the truest of virtues.<br />The novel is brimming with ambitious ideas about love, family, society, religion, service, deceit, you name it.  In addition, the writing is well exectuted and highly compelling even to the modern reader.  Without giving away the ending I would simply say that the outcomes both follow the logic of Tolstoy's opinions about right and wrong.  A long novel that one only wishes could never end.	2001-07-26

Much of the material presented in Mander's book is credible and compelling.  Certainly we have felt the television &quot;drain&quot; that he describes with respect to intelligence, creativity, worldview, etc.  Many of us are also aware of the, perhaps unavoidable, tendency of television to enhance and consolidate the positions of those who administer it's content.  We are also aware that the purpose of television is to get us to buy things and thus further the cause of a capitalist-consumer society.<br />The single problem with Mander's argument is: to eliminate television from America (more logically from the world over) would REQUIRE a dictatorship.  There is no getting around this, yet he never addresses this problem.  Certainly television can sometimes promote the power of special interests that are in conflict with the long term goals of humanity, but how would the absence of television insure a more just and intelligent society?  It comes down to freedom.  We cannot &quot;eliminate&quot; television from the face of the earth, nor should we.  We can however, individually, exercise the sacred right of individual freedom and choose not to watch it.  That far, and no farther.	2001-07-10

Reed was undoubtedly a good man and I don't mean to discredit his character, just his logic.<br />That aside, this work is fascinating in that it presents so many of the pivotal events in the formation of the Soviet Socialist system from the point of view of someone who was right there while it happened.  Add to this the fact that he was an American and thus understood the American sensibility and you have a work of near genius.  For the average American reader, this work must have been illuminating for reasons of its style as well as its content.<br />Reed does have obvious bias in favor of the Bolsheviki, indeed Trotsky is portrayed as a demigod, but he is able to sympathetically depict the plight of the nation of Russia near the close of WWI and enlighten the reader to the numerous causes of the Revolution, and why it must have seemed so inevitable and right to those who experienced it.<br />Overall a stunning work of journalism and history, highly worth your time.	2001-07-09

It is primarily a factually sound refutation of the Bible as being the \\"revealed word of God\\" as well as a passionate statement of his own religious belief, that of Deism.  Paine must have been an extraordinary human being - certainly the attack of power-entrenched religious orthodoxy has been fatal to many that trod before him (as well as after) so I am firmly impressed by the man's courage.  But beyond this I also \\"got\\" a profound sense of moral goodness - he speaks of the \\"Rights of Man\\" with such integrity that it violently stirred my own emotions.<br /><br />It would have been interesting to see what would have come from Paine had he known of the theories of Darwin, Einstein, Freud, as well as the modern theories of cosmology and physics, as it was these areas of natural science that inspired his belief in the Divine.	2001-07-09

If you are considering investment in anything other than a broadly diversified index fund and holding it for the long term through the inevitable downturns then you would be well advised to read this book.<br />Put simply, Malkiel's argument is that buying and holding an index fund is the easiest way for the average joe to make money in the market if they are willing to hold on tight during the market dips.  He does not discourage the outright purchase of individual securities as well as other more risky financial instruments, but he does demonstrate that the odds are stacked against you for long term success in such endeavors when all the pitfalls are considered (i.e. capital gains taxes, brokerage commissions, the utter folly in trying to time your buys/sells, your ability to sleep soundly, etc.).<br />I would also point out that the book is not without it's more technical sections.  Much of it involves some minor mathematical examples.  Nothing beyond the level of high school algebra and statistics, but if you are not enthralled with such a prospect then you might look for something more fuzzy such as The Motley Fool Investment Guide by the Brothers Gardner or One Up On Wall Street by Peter Lynch.  Both of these works also herald the index fund while offering suggestions for individual stock picking strategies for the more daring/foolish/Foolish among us.<br />Overall you may find this book to be iconoclastic in it's approach to the Wall Street Wise.  Remember that the majority of mutual funds have underperformed the market averages over the long term - food for thought.	2001-07-06

For those unfamiliar with the story it concerns the experience of a young would-be novelist, Stingo, who, attempting to write while living in Brooklyn, encounters two individuals who provide him with enough material to fill ten books. Nathan is an American Jew and Sophie an immigrant Catholic Pole - the latter is a survivor of Auschwitz. It is in the memories of Sophie that the novel's true power dwells.<br />This is a long novel, but it is beautifully written, no words are wasted. Styron is clearly a novelist of tremendous ability and depth. For those who don't want to read about the Holocaust for fear of the obvious potential for horror I can only say that given what went on this novel seemed restrained in it's use of sadistic imagery, but it still cuts right to the bone. Sophie's \\"choice\\" is heartbreaking and perfectly sums up the helplessness against unexplainable evil that this novel confronts so expertly.<br />This novel was rated in the recent survey by Modern Library as one of the hundred greatest novels of the English language of the last century - it deserves to be so honored.	2000-10-19

I read this book pretty rapidly because it was so unbelievable.  The experience of the Donner Party is one that is impossible for most of us to imagine.  If you are familiar with the book (or movie) Alive, by Piers Paul Read, then you will have some sense of what takes place.  Many passages brought tears to my eyes.<br />If you are not familiar with the story of the Donner Party, they were a group of 87 pioneers who set out for California from Illinois in the spring of 1846.  They traveled via a passage (which was essentially untried at that time) that was being hawked by a man named Hastings.  The trail led them through an ordeal that included near death from thirst, marauding Indians, at least one murder, and, finally, their entrapment in the Sierra Nevada through the worst-ever recorded winter in that region.  Sadly, most of the party that survived did so by yielding to the necessity of cannibalism.  About half of the original party got out alive.<br />If you are as fascinated by true tales of extreme survival as I am, then this book will certainly prove gripping.  One is reminded of the story of Shackleton's Endurance, or of the Uruguayan rugby team which suffered a plane crash in the Andes of South America.  I recommend it without reservation to anyone who can stand it - but it is a most depressing saga.	2000-10-07

Alive is the true story of the Uruguayan rugby team whose crossing of the Andes by plane ended in a tragic crash.

The boys were faced with almost certain death, yet their faith in each other and in God enabled them to withstand what for most of us would be beyond our ability to endure.  After reading this book, if anything, you will appreciate how good your life is, in spite of how you may feel about it beforehand.  Knowing what human beings can endure and triumph over is a great boon to my hope for the future of humanity.	2000-10-07

If you are not familiar with Fermat's Last Theorem and why it is such a &quot;big  deal&quot;, let me just tantalize you by saying that it is basically a  &quot;generalized&quot; version of the Pythagorean theorem (the one  involving right triangles, which you have surely seen if you have ever  taken trigonometry in high school), although it asserts that higher forms  of the Pythagorean-style equation are unsolvable.<br />Singh gives an  exquisitely detailed history of the problem going all the way back to its  ancient Greek roots (i.e. Pythagoras), proceeds through  numerous failed  attempts to solve Fermat's challenging theorem by the great mathematicians  that succeeded him, and finally concludes with the (initially uncertain)  triumph of Andrew Wiles, who posessed the genius to prove the  Taniyama-Shimura conjecture (which implies the truth of FLT) and solidify a  previously precarious bridge to vast new mathematical wonderlands.<br />If you  enjoyed mathematics at some point in your life and think that interest may  still be lingering within you, then you may want to get this one fast -  your curiousity and admiration will be revived.

Nevertheless I think Salem's Lot was a &quot;breed apart&quot;, the one  novel of his which I would recommend enthusiastically to any avid reader,  regardless of their genre preference.  King demonstrates clearly that he is  no mere hack - the book makes a silly sounding premise (vampires?  this is  the 20th century - oops 21st!) utterly frightening.  If you have never read  a King novel before give this one a shot. And leave the nightlight on.	2000-05-10

In spite of the tendencies  to categorize quality WITHIN a genre, I claim that this ranks as a great novel of the 1970s across ANY genre.  The book weaves a dreamy spell that takes hold subtly,  deeply.  The plot is extremely well constructed - there are no extraneous  details.  Homage is due (and paid) to the great American craftsmen of the  ghost story, Hawthorne and James.  The only flaw is in the ending - it's a  bit of a letdown.<br />Don't even bother seeing the movie - they don't even  compare, in spite of the enthusiasm of some of these other citizen critics.  If you have seen the movie already don't worry - the differences with the  novel are so essential that it won't really spoil too much (except for the  identity of the &quot;ghost&quot;).  Best enjoyed in the late fall evenings  (around Halloween) of upstate NY by a crackling fire - while you're alone  in the house.  You will be amazed at the effect - happy reading.	2000-04-04
