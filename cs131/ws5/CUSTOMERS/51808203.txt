But here I will make an exception since this book IS an exception. <br /> <br />There can be no better review of this wonderful book than the Table of Contents itself: go check it out yourself: you'll see an amazing array of authors culled from the last 810 years spouting off their opinions about what they think makes for Architecture as an art. And that's what makes this book so terrific. After all, what a thing like 'Architecture' is, is defined not by its \\"essence\\" or \\"substance\\" but by how it is perceived to be; and by how people struggled, in its name, to make something worth looking at and talking about. <br /> <br />The author's 25+ pages of introduction is the best overview of the history of (Western) Architecture I've ever read. History in the best sense of the word: by registering all the major problems that affected, determined, and altered Architecture INTO its modernity. It is a feat in itself that he could pull something like that off. <br /> <br />Every original document is introduced by the authors in a paragrapgh or two, and then is allowed to speak as it once spoke when it was first published. Some of the problems that once thrilled and annoyed the best architectural minds may now come off seeming either quaint, incomprehensible, or even mysterious. But no matter how distant some of these problems may appear today, you can see for yourself two things: One, architects of the past entertained bigger ideas than architects do today; Two, that architects of the past did not suffer from the kind of disease of the soul that seems to be par for the course in posturing as an \\"avant-garde.\\" <br /> <br />Highly recommended for all students of Architecture who, for want of maturity of architectural understanding, like to insist that the Bilbao Guggenheim, or the Berlin Jewish Museum is onpar with say, the Duomo in Milano.	2005-09-20

Of course, you have - in college, as you properly should have, when you didn't know any better about the world. Now you are wiser, but you still have your favorites among his aphorisms; always a dictum or two, tucked away in your pocket like a trusty little Swiss Army knife that Uncle Freddie gave you to whip out when you find yourself in a forest of nihilism and defeat. \\"What does not kill me makes me stronger\\" certainly helped me through many a defeat in my youth. But now that I have succeeded in becoming a full-fledged nobody, I can confidently say I am not an -\\"ean\\" to anybody's name; and mostly certainly not a Nietzschean. And this collection of essays corroborates what I have come to know through living the same (more or less) reality that Nietzsche himself did. <br /> <br />This book, I admit, though highly entertaining and just, is irrelevant to scholarship. But it IS weird (as one reviewer said), and there lies the book's surprising, and surprisingly delightful content: Just about all the essays are written with verve, wit, passion, rationality, and mastery of that uniquely mellifluous don't-give-a-flying-puck style of writing at which the French are known excel when provoked by kitsch...and Nietzsche DID write a lot of kitsch. However, the essays in this book will not be quoted by anybody who might need/want to thoroughly, academically, trash N's ideas. But then, these essays are NOT about trashing N so much as they are about pointing out, in a manner most stylishly and cavalier, the malignant effects of the dingleberry-ish cottage industry that's sprung up (first in France, and then by infection, the US) in the shadow of the \\"great\\" man's name. (Anyone who is familiar with the tenor of academia in the humanities will know the sort of \\"Nietzsche-inspired\\" clap-trap that \\"small Nietzscheans\\" - and they are legion - like to pass around as the most sublime profundity.) <br /> <br />As mentioned in \\"Book Description\\" above: \\"To think withNietzsche against Nietzsche\\": that is the spirit with which this small collective enterprise is undertaken: ...Contra Nietzsche... Ironically, what could be more Nietzschean than that? Indeed, the authors openly admit the necessity, importance, and GREATNESS of Nietzsche, but they argue that it is neither enough, nor \\"healthy\\", to stick with Nietzsche to the point of being an \\"-ean.\\" They all realize (as we all do) very well that N said everything twice: once `for' and once `against'. He's a mercurial fellow and you're never going to catch him sitting in any given spot twice. But, the fact is, N also said (wrote) a lot of stuff that cannot be undone by any sophistry. \\"One Jew more or less...what does it matter?\\" \\"There is no truth.\\" There's more, even more egregious, but we know that. <br /> <br />The point of this book is to make you stop and review the QUALITY of your allegiance, assumptions, and/or imaginary projections, if any, to Nietzsche's ideas. Read the intro to Human-All-Too-Human and you will know how lonely this guy really was. I admire Nietzsche's work as much as the next guy, but I take half of what he said with a grain of salt, taking into account the moral uptightness of the period in which he lived and suffered through. Besides, N was all about style, great style, not truth - certainly not certitude or accuracy. In Heideggerian terms, we might say that Nietzsche the Thinker was \\"sent\\" by Being to trigger a (survivable) heart attack for the body of metaphysical thinking. And just as Nietzsche prophesied, that heart attack was followed by 2 wars, \\"on a scale humanity had never seen.\\" But the body survived, and we know what to take away from the lesson. So do we need to keep returning to the heart attack when the bypass sugery has been successfully done?  <br /> <br />	2005-09-05

He cites as examples of design that have attained \\"design nirvana\\": ordinary objects and machines -- airplanes, power grids, drugs -- that anonymously allow the modern world to function as one without any of us taking notice of their vital functions...until they fail.     In a time when staying optimistic about the world requires (for me) more calories than a workout on the stairmaster, I need all the GOOD NEWS I can get, this book has nothing but. True, the book does have that certain hoaky 'TIME's 30 New Leaders of the New Millenium'-style of presentation: 2 page interviews that cannot really go into any depth about anything; and great ideas that may never see the light of day for reasons beyond anyone's control. But let's let that slide: some of the ideas are already in place. Besides, even a misanthrope like me has to take a break and hope every now and then...    Mau (and his team of researchers) addresses here the bigger issue in design: they call it the \\"design of the world.\\" That is, as opposed to the narrow \\"world of design\\" that is so often mired in pathological (head up the colon) narcissism in its inane, frivolous pursuit / fetishism of singular objects.   Thus, in keeping with their objective of presenting a wider perspective, Mau and his team wisely steered clear of all \\"celebrity designers\\" -- who are...what, for the most part, essentially nothing more than fussy, uptight, tempermental servant-toadies whose function is to glamorize the imperialism of capitalism, are they not?     Instead, they went talking to scientists, science writers, engineers, an economist(Hernando de Soto), a law professor, engineers, et al. And a couple of architects who seem sincere and all, but could have been left out.    The people interviewed here, for the most part, have the means and ideas to bring about REAL consequential changes on a global scale: people who don't call themselves designers butwhose works are crucial in shaping the world to come for the better. And as the interviewees use the word, 'better' means 'better for EVERYONE' on this planet. And that means seeing Design as 'creatively, compassionately applied-intelligence' to the real problems faced by billions of people who do not live in the well-plugged cities of the world, and do not share even a fraction of what most of us take for granted. Electricity and potable water, for example. We're not talking about a \\"better\\" office cubicle or a \\"better\\" sofa, cappucino maker, shoes, etc -- important though they are. The book merely asks that we get a perspective on things.    In keeping with the TIME mag format, the book functions as an ad for the people (and their org) who are featured here -- which is fine, since ignoramuses like me can get an overview of who's doing what. But it also a manifesto calling for a bigger idea of 'design': Design as the art of domesticating the full potential of technology to situate ourselves back into the law of ecology by by creative cosmopolitanism and ethical pragmatism in our stewardship of the world.    If, like me, you agree with Hal Foster's diatribe in his 'Design and Crime' (where he basically accuses  the design industry of being complicitly evil for serving a self-serving structure of inequity), then I think this book offers a hopeful view of Design as something REALLY consequential -- as opposed to that arrogated by the frivolous, exclusionary, image-driven, self-important nincumpoops that comprise the field of \\"high design\\" today.    Highly recommended for 2 kinds of people:   One, colonocephalic people who cannot see other people -- only what they have on; and think nothing of killing to have a 'nice pair/set of whatever.'  Two, all cool people who dream of a cool world for all.	2005-03-01

We pretty much know all the crucial When's, Who's and What's.<br />That means, what we're measuring is the biographers' ability to put together all that data into something 'insightful' about a genius we can never 'really' know.<br /><br />Right now, there two other contenders for the title of Best Mozart Bio: The one by Maynard Solomon and the other by Robert Gutman. If you're into (unnecessarily) long sentences and pop psychoanalysis, then the one by M. Solomon might be the thing for you. (I got a lot out of Solomon's Beethoven, but with Mozart, his psychologizing is just annoying.)<br />Gutman's is exhaustive...and exhausting -- to all except probably to Mozart scholars.<br /><br />Now, Hilbersheimer. A deservedly well-regarded novelist and man of letters in Germany but unfortunately not as well-known in the Anglophone countries. Hildesheimer's rendering of Mozart, which started out as a lecture in 1956, is still fresh...and delightfully eccentric, but not at the expense of historical truth. Quite blunt with facts, actually: noticeable is the author's radical departure from the usual practice of scholarly 'discretion' with regard to Mozart's \\"deviant obsessions,\\" which were largely coprophilic, apparently.<br /><br />Hildesheimer's affection for Mozart's genius is genuine but not adulatory. (And as if to emphasize the authenticity of Mozart's true genius, the author, strangely enough, does take some potshots throughout the book at Rilke as an example of a \\"fake genius.\\" )<br />Anyway, here you get just enough psychology -- without feeling like you're reading a therapist's evaluation sheets --to give you a sense of the man's pathological quirks that made him a man and not a god. You get enough of the cultural milieu to appreciate how little Wolfie became the MOZART -- without having to pop a No-Doz pill just to get through all the tedious historical detail. And you get, more than perhaps anywhere else, a real insight into Mozart the GUY who just happened to be a musical genius, AND who also happened to have one bawdy sense of humor!<br /><br />Example: When Mozart had nothing else to do, he himself kept up his sister's journal, describing the vegetative life in a humorous (and often ill-humored) way, in pointed contrast to the dry unemotional entries of his sister, whose voice he assumed:<br />\\"The 17th: With Katherl at the home of Mlle the Saint, who picks her nose with her big toe.\\"<br />\\"The 19th: Stayed home with a pipe up the arse, with the pipe up the arse...\\"<br />\\"The 52nd: Lodron at our house in the afternoonish. We went to Fiala's. At 3 o'clock all of us went a walking, welking, wulking, wolking, wilking. It day a fine was.\\"<br />\\"The 82nd: a half to niney, blow one out behindy in church.<br />At  quarter past niney, blow one out behindey at Mayr's....\\"<br /><br />In short, it's the quirky style of German prose whose literary lineage goes all the way back to the great Baroque novel 'Simplicius Simplicissmus' -- and the content as shaped by such a style -- that makes this version of Mozart so enjoyable.<br /><br />By definition, no Bio is going to be \\"definitive,\\" and any that claims to be one is bunk. So, whatever else you might read about Mozart, be sure to include this one too. New scholarship may shed more light on the minutiae of Mozart's life but only Hildesheimer's gives you a Mozart you can imagine as a contemporary.ill just to get through all the tedious historical detail.

US	51808203	RPTZNKJTGHYRY	0262740257	382178745	The Puppet and the Dwarf: The Perverse Core of Christianity (Short Circuits)	Books	5	89	92	N	Y	Christianity as the original atheism?	You're either gonna read Zizek -- because you have to or because you just love this guy -- or you are not, regardless of any review. So I'll keep it brief: Yes, the rambling style can be distracting as well as entertaining when he gets it right.  <br /> <br />The book is not so much about Christianity as it is about what Zizek claims to be the very core of it, where there is another dimension. And in discussing the core as such, the book takes off as a reading of the symbolic structure (Lacanian) that made it possible for the transition from Judaic Law to Christian Love; and St. Paul's role in it. Jesus' \\"Father why hast thou forsaken me?\\" is one of the loci of Zizek's defense of the \\"ex-timate\\" kernel of Christianity: 'Imitatio Christi' as sharing Jesus' own doubt -- not of God's existence but rather of His Impotence. And after taking some very general swipes at Buddhism for (supposedly) aiming for that state (Nirvana) in which all differences are leveled, Zizek presents the genius of Christianity as the religion of Difference in which the very separation between God and Man is God-as-Man. Zizek argues against the idea that the Fall and Redemption are polarities but that the Fall IS Redemption, the Opening of the very space of Redemption. <br /> <br />The crux of Zizek's \\"argument\\" boils down to what he says in the last page: \\"...It is possible today to redeem this core of Christianity only in the  gesture of abandoning the shell of its institutional organization (and even more so, of its specific religious experience). The gap here is irreducible: either one drops the religious form, or one maintains the form but lose the essence. This is the ultimate heroic gesture that awaits Christianity: in order to save its treasure, it has to sacrifice itself -- like Christ, who had to die so that Christianity could emerge.\\" <br /> <br />The basic attitude of the book is fueled by contempt for opportunistic liberals, academics, and intellectuals, in short, the Last Man, whodrinks decaf and jogs to stay fit, and make a habit of demanding the highest ethical ideals from society KNOWING full well society cannot possibly deliver. Zizek's venom is aimed at the fact that this very impossibility allows intellectuals without any real moral commitment to wallow smug their safe, cushy university jobs and still feel good about themselves for having demonstrated a nobler social conscience: A life devoted to speaking dangerously with all the possibility of danger (and caffeine) removed.  <br /> <br />Zizek's enlistment of G.K.Chesterton -- who was, himself, perverse enough to speak (and very convincingly too!) of the \\"Thrilling Romance of Orthodoxy\\" -- to kick off his argument is a brilliant move and that alone makes this book worth reading. <br /> <br />Read this book like it was a clearance sale where everything is 90% off: the only thing is, some very fine finds come attached to a lot of junk you don't need. So, keep the baby and throw out the bath water -- even if you know Zizek can convince you that it's really the bath water you should keep.	2004-11-30
US	51808203	R5C821SG92O37	0415140382	790097153	Heidegger's Hidden Sources: East-Asian Influences on his Work	Books	5	18	25	N	Y	As in love and war, all is fair in philosophy	I rate this 5 stars just to get it up to 4, which is about right, I think.    Let us recall the socio-political climate of the times when Marty was in agony over the West's metaphysical tradtion. Philosophy was more or less sputtering at the time for want of something to fresh say. Who at that time was saying something totally unheard of; something so funky and seductively nonsensical that one had to squeeze some new meaning into them? Richard Wilhelm the sinologist had just translated the I JING and was giving lectures to small groups. Heigdegger was most certainly aware of Wilhelm's work.    The author (May) was Heidegger's student and saw some things first hand. If May's claims are correct (I have no overwhelming evidence to suspect he is not), then indeed, we should pay a little more attention to how Heidegger went about getting some of his ideas. Marty hired a Chinese doctoral student to help him privately (maybe even secretly) to translate the Lao Dze's DAO DE JING. He was quite studious about it, apparently.     One might argue that some of May's findings of connections between Heidegger's work and Daoist literature are circumstantial. Maybe they are. Here's a short list, with Heidegger's terms first then Daoist in *( ): The Open / Clearing *(Emptiness); Pathway *(Dao); etc. There's more.    Zhuang Dze (22): \\"What gives things their thingness is not itself a thing.\\"  Marty: \\"The thingness of the thing...itself cannot be a thing again.\\"   And the famous formulation in 'Being and Time': \\"The Being of beings 'is' not itself a being.\\"    Alright, so what of it? Great minds think alike? Maybe. Marty learned a few things from the Chinese? Also maybe. But that's not the question one should be asking in a gesture of dismissal.  May's book is not an 'expose' of something embarrassing that Heidegger wanted to hide in shame. Anxiety of influence, etc. Rather, I think Heidegger was right to not acknowledge the Chinese influence in his work -- if only to keep those who will come after him to stay within the straight and narrow of the Western tradition of 'philosophy' as such.   Besides, Marty probably saw it as a bank loan that would be erased once it has served its purpose and paid back with interest. Whatever the source of his ideas, one could argue that Heidegger more than paid the loan back: After all, the house is rebuilt and new rooms are being added even as we speak. (As an architect, I couldn't vouch for the soundness of the structure, however.)    Poor sales of this book indicates that professors who cannot get enough of this guy's work/life do not make this book mandatory reading for their students. Which is strange but also understandable: they just don't wanna \\"go there\\" since that would entail extra exegetical work and uncertain forays into unfamiliar territories from which they might end up fetching the wrong things and make fools of themselves. Or, maybe there exists something like 'Code Red' (the unwritten 'don't go there' policy) that reflects something inherently, unbreakably Euro-centric (Judeo-Xtian)within contemporary (Occidental) critical theory, despite all the politically correct-sounding rhetoric.    The bulk of postmodern thinking is about the problem of 'thinking without metaphysics' which amounts to 'thinking without Christianity' more or less: an impossibel task -- sort of like performing a total dissection on oneself and wanting to live to tell about it.   Unfortunately, most thinkers in the West go about trying to solve this agonizing problem as if there were no other models of thinking worthy of their attention. (Or else they get all bent out of shape torturing language and themselves over something like, \\"the psychoanalytic politics/ethics of post-colonial ap/propriation of dis/avowal of the Other in the absence of the Subject as the Thing.\\") Levinas was perhaps most honest about this when he expressed his horror of the 'Yellow Peril' as an alien mode of thought so alien as to be Martian.    Stubborness? Pride? An unspoken attitude of smugness and sense of superiority derived fron the very patriarchal edifice they want to deconstruct? Much of the high-flying rhetoric about being open to 'diversity' and 'what-comes' falls a little flat in the provincial attitude within modern high theory that would relegate all 'Other' to East Asian Studies, anthropology, or Buddhist Studies. So, same pie, just sliced into different shapes, less sugar, thinner crust, but in the end, still the same pie.    The question remains: WHY did Marty feel he had to take out a loan from a bank so far away?   Francois Jullien's books including the very enlightening 'Detour and Access' (see my review) might be helpful if you really want to know -- and also get a head start on figuring out what one version of Deleuze's ideas has been.	2004-10-14

As a superb example of idle, pointless, academic inanity - 5 stars. So, 3 stars.    The \\"professional\\" reviews were seductive. So I bought it. And read it -- groaning most of the way through. Happily, it's a short book, with the text taking up only about 200 pages. Six stories in all, one of them self-consciously devoted to the problem of the author's own \\"reflexivity\\" -- that is, how the writer's subjectivity affects and intereferes, for better or worse, the subject of study. How very considerate and so... Stuart Smalley of you.    No doubt, this book has much to offer, especially to those people who might think that thinking about, and living in, a universe in which 'x' can \\"oscillate\\" into other states of identity -- 'y' and/or 'z' -- is so \\"radical.\\" However, so much of what is said in the name of postmodernity and \\"Other\\" is said with so much parochial ignorance of others (that is, other cultures' far more exhaustive work on this topic -- Hello! Buddhism?), and received with enthusiasm as if there is something genuinely new here.     In this book, if you remove all the tedious academic jargon (\\"singular multiplicity,\\" \\"coherence without a center,\\" \\"oscillation,\\" etc), the argument boils down to something very obvious -- and (I'll be generous here) highly 'mediocre' in insight value -- that has not only received more thorough treatment in various philosophical traditions, but also available to plain common sense: Namely, that no thing has a fixed identity in and of itself.     Forget the technobabble: Really, is it so damn hard to say that a large \\"table\\" can also be used as a \\"bed\\" or as a small \\"stage\\"? Or, that 'John Doe' can be simultaneously a soldier, husband, brother, father, etc? Where is the \\"Johnniness\\" in John? Well, there isn't any, since even John is a composite of flesh, nerves, bones, water, memory, desires, etc. Same for an aircraft: sometimes it excites young men, sometimes it flies, sometimes it drops bombs, sometimes it'scalled by other names --like a 'weapons system'... 'Nuf said.    Law's style of prose is at once flaccid, flatulent, and fastidious. And the content piggy-back rides on the names of some famous people (like Deleuze) and their concepts (like rhizome) without getting anywhere.    Despite my own disappointment with this book, I think the author wrote it in good faith. I think Professor Law really believes that he has something new and interesting to say. Well, he might, but I think only for three types of readers:     One: Undergrads who need to be told, and learn how to say obvious things in respectable academese (convoluted prose).     Two: Assistant profs looking to secure tenure someday in the so-called burgeoning field of Technoscience Studies -- as they have to incestuously quote (and praise) one another's work. (Scientists could not give a rat's arse about what these people have to say about their work.)    Three: People who cannot figure out why an \\"aircraft\\" cannot just remain an \\"aircraft\\"; and cannot understand that the name a thing goes by is NOT the thing \\"itself\\" as no thing has a specific, absolutely determined \\"selfhood.\\"    Now, I will take that vote of \\"Not Helpful\\" for having said Not Nice things about your friend or colleague's book.	2004-10-07

Each chapter deals with one of the events and objects that have structured for the West the illusion called Tibet. They are (and refer to):  <br /> <br />1. The Name (the term `Lamaism') <br />2. The Book  (The Tibetan Book of the Dead) <br />3. The Eye  (the book, `The Third Eye' by T. Lobsang Rampa) <br />4. The Spell  (the mantra Om Mani Padme Hum) <br />5. The Art  (Thangkas, Mandalas, Wrathful Deities, Skull cups, etc) <br />6. The Field  (of Buddhist Studies and Tibetology in the US) <br />7. The Prison (the collective illusion regarding \\"Tibet\\" and her mysteries) <br /> <br />Yes, the debunking is sobering as well as entertaining, as it is done with solid scholarly information delivered with biting wit and even Wildean sarcasm at times. <br /> <br />But the most interesting things the author mentions are questions and remain still as questions: Namely, the question of Tibetan clergy's willing \\"collusion\\" or co-option of the West's tendency to \\"psychologize\\" the Buddhist doctrine. For example, there is a marked tendency on the part of the Tibetan Lamas and American academics to veer away from interpreting the Six Realms as anything more than so many \\"psychological states\\" in this present incarnation but that is certainly NOT the way most Tibetans have been taught.  <br />Moreover, there is a Dalai Lama approved move to present to the West a user-friendly version of Tibetan Buddhism that is totally devoid of the really weird stuff that \\"formerly\\" took up (and still takes up for the average Tibetan) the bulk of what that faith used to be all about \\"back home\\": exorcism, magic, animistic rituals, etc., stuff that would be totally unacceptable in the modern West.  <br /> <br />The last chapter deals a bit with the so-called Shugden Affair that may have played a part in the murder of an old Lama and his two students who supported the Dalai Lama's new policy (after consulting an oracle) to outlaw Shugden (a protecting deity of the Geluk sect) worship. This was not widely reported in the media but apparently this was/is a big deal among the Tibetans in the dressing room backstage even as they continue to put on a great show on stage. <br /> <br />No doubt, Tibetan Buddhism, even in its Americanized (low fat, low salt, Stuart Smalley) version has something to offer to some people - if not to the West as a whole, then at least to the Tibetans' image. But are we in the West willing, ready, and daring enough to meet the Tibetans on their own religious turf and do what they do and eat what they eat, so to speak? If not, maybe going back to church and listening to a familiar sermon may not be entirely a bad idea for those who must have religion. <br /> <br />Let's not forget, nobody in China has ever heard of, let alone eat, Chop Suey.	2004-08-30

And, it is a book worth reading. But, given the seductive provocation embedded in such a title, I was a tad let down by the content, despite the presence of some very provocative (bordering on pomposity and teetering on the edge of error) statements indeed. To wit: &quot;Only western societies are governed by politics; the rest are ruled by power.&quot;   Regretably, Scruton does not take the time carefully sort out &quot;the rest&quot; in his rush to present his arguments concerning the near-impossibility of rapproachment between the west and the Islamic world.   If &quot;the rest&quot; is really all else outside of the West, it would only seem reasonable to include a statement justifying how, say, Japan -- a non-Islamic country if ever there was one -- is in the same menacing league as Iraq or Lybia in terms of her political structure.   Scruton is usually a careful writer, choosing to err, when he does, on the side of conservatism. And he does err a few times in this book unnecessarily. The book clearly gives the impression that it was rushed to hit the stands before the heat of the event (911) cooled. Even so, I cannot take away from Scruton his very admirably executed comparison of the key theoretical elements that went into the shaping, and ultimately differentiation, of the Christian political foundation from the Islamic.      A more honest but admittedly far less sexy title would have been along the lines of _On the Difference between the Christian and Islamic Political Foundations, and Its Ramifications in the Modern World_.	2004-08-01

Yes, this book is about Religion and Media, and contains essays by or interviews with 25 scholars from Europe and the US, including some famous ones: namely, J. Derrida, JL Nancy, S. Weber, TW Adorno, and others. I bought this without the benefit of having another reader's review of it and so was pleasantly surprised to see so many heavyweights present: the scholars featured here occupy positions of influence in their respective fields - from philosophy to anthropology to comparative religion to sciology.<br />The book serves as a very serviceable prism to refract the blinding and blindingly bright light of the subject into so many colorful opinions about the relationship between R and M.<br />The book is divided into three parts. The first part deals with the problem of framing of the problem through an interdisciplinary approach. The second part is less speculative about the issue as it deals with the historical and academic examples of approaches to the study of this phenomenon. The last part offers case studies and field work done by anthropologists and scholars of comparative religion.<br />The common concern in all these essays is the resurgence and fortification of religion (in some cases with lethal results) the world over in tandem with increasing de-religionization (that is to say, removal of all and any sense of the sacred from the public sphere of life.) Some of the questions asked are: Why is Christianity so much more mediatic than the other religions? How does the media's intervention in religion (and vice versa), with its instantaneous communication affect that particular sense of time that is crucial to a religious worldview? What is the function of politics in the mediatization of religion?<br />There's much food for thought here to help one figure out which way is north in this age of `New Age' in which so much seems to be heading south (of Reason). A solid read for those who understand the social importance of the phenomenon of religion.	2004-06-17
US	51808203	R123F1GYB2XN2Q	0804747385	832125654	The Open: Man and Animal	Books	5	52	60	N	Y	erudition as art as thought as action	A magisterial meditation on the question of the \\"human\\" -- used as an adjective. This short book is Agamben's 'Duino Elegies': thalassically poetic and swirling with thought that hovers, indifferent to the gravity of common sense. <br />The title refers to Heidegger's term for the possibility of Dasein but Agamben is not doing a pro-Heidegger critique here. The Italian is thinking against the German: Agamben mentions that Heidegger was in fact the harshest separator of man and animal in modern thought, denying animals the very possibility of ever seeing the OFFEN (Open) that is (supposedly) available to man alone. But forget Heidegger--the book's not about him. Agamben questions the very ground of Western thought that made it possible for Marty to make such an inhumane declaration at all.<br />Agamben's meditation begins with a medieval illustration that depicts the world after the end of the world (post-judgment) in which all the Saved are shown with various animal heads. Agamben wants to know what to make of this strange, unexplained overlapping of man and animal.<BR>And so he weaves a series of tales -- each only a few pages long and Kafkaesque in their brevity, mysteriousness, and flash of insight -- of how the idea that man and animal are two separate categories of being came to be. He weaves by unraveling the secret codes, the invisible knots that have held, and still hold, the most basic assumptions that drive Western thought, beginning with theology / philosophy and now, the bio-sciences.<br />I was startled to learn how seemingly silly hair-splitting arguments of the theologians concerning the resurrected body could be so consequential later in the modern age in the formulation (and separation) of man and animal. An example: Would the intestines of the resurrected be full or empty? If full, then what to do about the problem of excrement in the Kingdom of God? If empty, is it because they are no longer needed? And if that is the case, what have them at all?Etc.<BR>(BTW, it was decided that there would be no animals in Heaven.)<br />Agamben continues here what he began in his earlier works -- namely the meaning and consequence of NAKED or RAW LIFE, devoid of any qualifiers, such as \\"human\\" such that a \\"human\\" being becomes just a living thing.<BR>Agamben states that his purpose is to expose and figure out a way to stop what he calls the 'anthropological machine' whose rise and history made possible the most \\"logical\\" outcome of such thinking: The Holocaust. But Agamben does not limt the phenomenon of the Holocaust only to what happened to the Jews --he extends it the entire spectrum of modern political thinking that permits the stripping of human beings of humanity. (See HOMO SACER.) <br />Having said all that, I must confess, one cannot possibly do justice to this book by summarizing Agamben's little molecules of thought, so compact and phosphorescent are they.	2004-06-08

You either hate her or ? <BR>But if you do not already know her work, no review is really going to help you because a true review would have to be almost as complex as Ronell?s own writing to say something meaningful, and this is not the place for such an attempt. So I?ll pass, but say only what can be said in everyday language and include the content of the book below.<br />Ronell is to scholarship what Bruce Lee was to (traditional) kung-fu: 2 good-lookin? people exceeding the limits of standard practice after undergoing the rigorous training of the prerequisite discipline. Bruce did not disdain hitting below the belt, biting and scratching even: the point is to win the fight if you?re in one. Avital is the same when it comes to fighting the enemy: stupidity marinating in the warm formaldehyde of ignorance. The essays collected here are from the early 80?s to late 90?s, previously published in various journals. Her references are, well, everything ? from canonic texts (Kant, Freud, Goethe, Heidegger, etc) to Headline news. The richness of her ?multi-media? work using words (sentence?collages) alone is quite something: proof that only smart people can really art (used as a verb). And to enjoy her work, you really do need to read her stuff as a ?thinking artist? yourself.<br />Her writing is ferocious, fast, feline, fanged; and?friendly--not. She fences with a pen. Her language moves with the jaguaresque prowess of the English language at full throttle. She confesses she is writing, out of necessity, for those who fly more-or-less at her altitude of discourse. She also explains why she (or any writer) thinks/writes the way she does: she is, as a writer, not so much a manipulator of language so much as a medium by and through which language dictates what it wishes to say (think). She says, ?A text?s gotta do what a text?s gotta do.? Like Derrida, Ronell is interested in acts of questioningthat do not necessarily take recourse to discursivity. If this makes no sense, then you might want to pass on Ronell. <br />Freud, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Derrida, Hegel, Lyotard, etc ?you?ll need to have at least a cursory familiarity with their work to know what Ronell is saying. In other words, the book is inhospitable to the average undergraduate. <BR>But she is not out to show-off or intimidate. It?s just her way of thinking that requires this kind of language and speed. She rarely loses clarity in order to achieve some pointless cleverness the way 2nd rate academic obscurantists so often do. (Okay, so lost me on a couple of essays.) Hers is the thought of one who has experienced the fire of her material, and understands the impossibility of ?mastering? it. <br />Some say she represents the best of the new scholarship. Yes and no. She is neither a product of a given system nor a representative of future education. She is just a rare bird, a brilliant comet, an exceptionally intelligent and insightful scholar who also has the uncommon ability (and balls) to use her OWN language which is a mellifluous m?lang(e)uage of all styles of speech. <br />She is, as always, all style. And that offends a lot of people, apparently. But in her case, there is no division between style and substance ? and there is a lot of it.  Such is the sweet fruit of years of intensive knuckle-bruising cultivation and practice of literary kung-fu.<br />By ?finitude,? Ronell means the sense of humanity as shaped and delimited by our mortality, which is to say the ethical struggles to define our fragile humanity. She speculates whether ?we have gone too far this time, as terrestrials? in the process of pushing the Western logos to its potential (but logical) extreme. The one general concern that ties all these disparate essays together is the immanent problem of the ubiquity of the police: even without their physical presence, they are everywhere with their surveillance from afar. She has somevery interesting things to say about technology as the field of infinite Tests and Testing, whereby the real is by necessity deferred, waiting for ?confirmation.? And when the entire world has become a testing ground, what becomes of our ability to experience that which makes us human? <br />Content:<BR>1. Finitude?s Score<BR>2. 2. Queens of the Night<BR>3.

Learned they are indeed, and so gracious about it too.<br />You'd think this book was modeled after Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy as the book is composed of one digression after another -- but without ever losing the thread. Very humorous and informative tour, by way of digressions, of not only the Greek language but also of current English words with Greek origins.<br />Obscure factoids about linguistics, mathematics, dead languages like Phoenician, and Greek myths, history and literature await to delight the reader on every page. <br />For example, in talking about hydro-, hypo-, hyper, and hygro-, the authors also manage to fill you in on some delightful trivia about the process of making glass --- all in the same paragraph.<br />In reading this book, you'll be convinced that there is not a single boring letter in the alphabet.<br />I gave this book to my academically disinclined nephew many years ago, and he was so turned on to learning afterwards that he eventually ended up going to a hard-to-get-in East Coast school. Highly recommended to all but especially to smart young people who are bored to tears by school.	2004-05-12

It is better and more succinctly described in _Means Without Ends_. <BR>In this is book, Agamben soberly traces the origin of the single most deracinating event in human history: the Holocaust. Soberly, because Agamben sees the Holocaust not as an anomaly, but as an unavoidable consequence given the political origin of the West. But this book is not so much about the Holocaust per se, but about the various historical interventions concerning the notion of the Sovereign that wove the matrix of Western politics into what it became capable of in the 20th century.<BR>The locus of Agamben's view of modernity is the (concentration) camp. Agamben stresses the fact that the camp is not only a place where the unspeakable takes place but more importantly and fundamentally where a human being is stripped &quot;Naked&quot;, stripped of 'bios' and exposed as mere 'zoe', such that anything--including the unspeakable--CAN be done to him since nothing could be considered a criminal act. The camp, according to Agamben, is &quot;the space that opens up when the state of exception starts to become the rule.&quot;<BR>Agamben argues that the camp is the new biopolitical NOMOS of the planet by connecting the dots that Carl Schmitt first drew but left unconnected. Closer to the homefront, Agamben's meditation ultimately takes us to see the totalitarian implications behind those &quot;gated communities&quot; in the US today, and the impossibility of dying without the State's approval. If a good life is hinged on the hope of a good death, should the State define and decide who shall get &quot;good death&quot; (euthanasia)?	2004-05-02

I really, really doubt that she wrote the book so she could buy a(nother) condo in Aspen.<br />If you read the book without attributing some imaginary callous cynicism on the part of the author's so-called \\"motive,\\" I think you will see that Ehrenreich is genuinely concerned about the future of the people who are simply NOT getting by no matter how hard they work.<br />This book, short and punchy, gives one accurate-enough a picture of what it is like to be too over-worked to stop and figure out how to fend for oneself.<br />Must one necessarily fall into an open manhole, break a bone, and permanently wallow in the sewage in order to to claim the right to speak on behalf of those who did fall in and are still trapped down there?<BR>Really, to demand the author's head on a platter for taking breaks between assignments or using her credit card to stay afloat is just too much bile and venom.<br />As far as I am concerned, the author walked the walk and shed light enough on the subject for me to do things differently from now on. And that's enough for me to praise this book.	2004-05-02

It's loose, fast, off the cuff, not to say slangy. She uses certain words that are probably not really part of most people's vocabulary, and as far as I can see, that really is about the only way she indulges herself in this book.<br />The book comes off feeling like a letter that an educated person would write to her (educated) friends. <BR>But then, is it not the members of the so-called \\"educated class\\" with with their massive expendable income and social influence who need to see the picture that Ehrenreich is presenting here and maybe rethink about how it is that they are sustained in all their comforts and privileges?<br />Subjectivity in the form of anger and compasssion pervades the writing throughout. But it is also, by turns, witty, sassy, cheeky, humorous (no, HILARIOUS), tough, and, yes, even sarcastic when called for --- about the creepy Orwellian Double-Speak and euphemisms that corporations (such as Walmart)use (much like the military) to lull their employees into abject submission by referring to them as \\"associates\\" and tooting slogans like \\"respect the individual.\\"<br />Ehrenreich did not choose to live permanently amongthe working poor (would you?), and she mentions a few times that she has a Phd. But she is not bragging. The author tries to contextualize what she sees as the mental divide between the haves and the have-nots, and how it operates, even without any malice on the part of those who are well-off. <br />For example, she mentions that her daughter, ROSA, is attending Harvard. Sounds snooty? Guess again: Rosa goes to the home of a wealthy classmate whose father cavalierly assumes that Ehrenreich must have named her daughter after her favorite MAID. She did not. <BR>The author states as a matter of fact (like her having a PhD) that she does her own cleaning. She clearly states that she has always found the idea of hiring people to do one's own cleaning morally reprehensible.<br />Ehrenreich's mention of her own PhD and her daughter going to Harvard apparently annoys some people to the point where they cannot hear the rest of the story or skew it ----which is that those at the highest income brackets are (still) amazingly insensitive, not to say inhumane.<BR>Ehrenreich's musing about the stressed-out rich spending thousands of dollars at some Buddhist retreat (maybe) to learn about compassion and humility -- while maids clean their houses during their absence -- was funny in a totally unfunny way. <br />She walked the walk -- the walk nobody with an income big enough to own a pc with an internet hookup to read this review would ever voluntarily take.<br />I, for one, am deeply indebted to Barbara for her honest account of what she witnessed among those we see everyday without seeing -- as the struggling poor for the most part do their dignified darndest to NOT stand out.<br />The book has caused me think about my life and the true meaning of compassion more graphically than all the Dalai Lama books put together.<br />Any book that can change one's complacent view about the world is gold. For me, this book was platinum.	2004-05-01

But all truths are simple, and the simplest things are often the hardest to understand and put into practice.<br />I shall skip the synopsis since it has been so well written by other reviewers (except for one illiterate cynic in France). <BR>I shall only add that this book was originally written as the author's phd thesis under the late Mircea Eliade's tutelage at the University of Chicago, and submitted in 1981. This book is an updated and modified version of the same.<br />Written with clarity and balance, this is an excellent introduction to the subject of Tradition and Traditional thought as defined largely by Rene Guenon and Ananda Coomaraswamy -- each laying emphasis on different aspects of the commonly shared vision.<BR>Both Guenon and Coomaraswamy saw unity in all the civilizations of the world prior to the phenomenon of the modern West. They see no split between so-called East and West but between modern and pre-modern West. And the 'Modern West' must be understood to mean all nations, wherever they are, that now operate according to the ideology of material positivism as shaped by the economy, politics, and value systems inherent within scientism (strictly knobs and dials) and industrialization.<br />The purpose of this book, as the author states, is to guide the reader to do further research by reading the original texts by Guenon and Coomaraswamy and others, including, Fritjof Schuon, Mme. Blavatsky, Rudolf Steiner, et al: Those who spoke out against modernity's narrow identification of Reason with calculational rationality only; and its misguided use against Reason, the seat of intellectual intuition and the creative engine of spiritual and artistic propulsion.<br />This book gives one the impression that the author thinks dimly of modernity as a whole. But he exaggerates no facts of our time in order to paint an unduly pessimistic picture: it is what we read about every day.<br />Acting as a messenger for Guenon, Coomaraswamy and the Tradition as a whole, the author's message is that we must re-examine Tradition within the emerging global perspective.<br />His message is one that the Dalai Lama has also expressed: that we move beyond the program of life as defined by &quot;religion&quot; and find a way to live more spiritually as truly 'human' beings.<br />As much as I would agree with the author, poor sales of this book seems to suggest that he is hoping against the tide.<BR>But then, is that not the essence of hope: lighting a candle in the wind?	2004-04-18

Paul is everything Nietzsche screamed about being without necessarily proving that he was himself what he would enjoin others to become: Genuinely cheerful, high-thinking, irreverent about the past, just big, and &quot;Greek.&quot; Paul has written a wonderful book--seemingly all the more wonderful for confirming so many of my own observations about the subject.<br />Here in this book he expands on the ideas he presented in his earlier book &quot;What is Architecture?&quot; and he does so in a way that delights,informs, teaches, and shocks. No small feat, mate. <BR>And he pulls this off by writing in a style that is nonexistent in the field. The book reads like a diary--of the kind 19th century biologists and anthropolgists used to keep: accurate, subjective, poetic when wrong, speculative, eloquent, filled with arcane data, and connected to LIVED LIFE.<BR>And to tell his story, he brings in his family, his students, his house, his travels, ants in his backyard, etc --whatever he's got at his fingertips.<br />For Paul there is no past: No dinosaurs, no pyramids in the past for him because they are all right here right now--as they cannot but be otherwise. (His brand of &quot;optimism&quot; about machines and technology cannot even be called optimism--since optimism is an attitude that comes from acknowledging that cause for pessimism does exist but would rather not focus on it.) In Pauls's view, there is also no future but only NOW. A rather Zen attitude, ain't it.<br />In this book, Paul makes no attempt to restrain his joy and wonderment at the sheer fact of existence of EVERYTHING including us and our irrepressible urge to tinker to make ourselves in different material other than flesh and blood only.<br />The title of the book, ARTIFICIAL LOVE comes from a conversation in which his friends, Maria and Jaques are debating whether machines are indeed alive: Maria says machines are 'artifical life.' Jaques wonder if all this time what he felt for them was, then, 'artificial love.'<br />Written like a novel, this book is weird in that it contains REAL architecture talk that ACTUALLY takes place between real smart and fun architects when they are just shootin' the breeze.<BR>If you think about all the pretentious archi-babble that fills the pages of so many &quot;high-theory&quot; architecture books today, it kinda makes you go, &quot;wassupwitdat?&quot;<br />Highly recommended for all smart people but especially for small-minded as well as big-minded architects--but for totally different reasons.	2004-03-30

The synopsis of the story is as another reveiwer has already described below: namely that the kick-off of modernity with Descartes'  \\"I think therefore I am\\" was not something that popped out of the blue of his profound brain but a working hypothesis in search of a foundation of certainty---to be applied to theology promarily so as to end the sort of savagery that was devastating Europe in the name of religion during his lifetime (the 30 Years War).<br />Toulmin contextualizes Newton's discovery and Hobbes' political philosophy (briefly but enough to make the connection) in the light of this quest for certainty that held so many of the best minds in Europe spellbound for all these years. With a pace that won't let up, Toulmin takes you on a tour of Europe's social and intellectual transformation: going from poverty and social schism and a sense of doom in 1610 to a confident, unquestionable, and unquestioned, established cosmopolitical paradigm of order that was foisted onto social and political (thus also art) agendas.<br />So far so good but it sounds like something you've heard before doesn''t it? That's when this book takes off:<br />Toulmin digs at the 'subtexts' of these common-knowledge events to show you some very interesting presuppositions (seemingly innocuous at first) inherent in these great scientific discoveries that could not but lead to the institutionalization of racism, sexism, and nationalisms that had such traumatic consequences in the 20th century, with continuing severe after-shocks today.<br />Looking back, we might smugly click our tongues at the insanity that gripped post-Montaigne Europe, and wonder what the fuss was all about. But Toulmin makes his thesis pressingly relevant to us today by drawing parallels with events and situations that are still with us today.<br />The author rounds out his argument by giving a brief but clear accounting of the major players (French and German) today who are redefining the concept of modernity from mutually opposite ends.<br />Toumin's assessment of the legacy of modernity--however it may have got started--is one of of hope and optimism as he reminds the reader that in making the distinction between 'power' and 'force' (Hobbes) there is also this thing called ' moral influence' which, he hopes, will serve as the engine of renewal and humanization of 'modernity' in all its possibilities.<br />Maybe this is not the best or the most comprehensive account of the origin of post-modernism and/or its tendencies, but the book does give you about a 120 degree panorama--through a powerful telescope. Isn't that enough in a book?	2004-03-20

It would contain some German verbs, some French nouns, some Italian adjectives, etc. How useful is it going to be?<BR>This book would be a cousin to such an imaginary but nontheless absurd book.<br />My main gripe is that, as someone already pointed out, it is badly organized. It is nearly useless as a reference book. The faults are too many to mention, so I shall not, except for just one example: all the pictures are B&amp;W, and not even numbered, so that one has to sort through just to figure out which description applies to which one of the many illustration found on the same page.<br />The real source of the problem with this book is that it tries to cover way too many cultures -- from Thailand to Korea to Japan to Bhutan -- and it tries this in a mere 216 pages (!), including the frontispiece, blanks, and index: as if a Guide to Buddhist Art could be done like a store catalogue. Just the symbolism of the mudras alone would easily take 200 pages, I should think.<br />Every Buddhist culture has its own peculiar relationship and input to Buddhism. Although there are large areas of doctrinal overlap that all Buddhist cultures have in common, each culture still has its own line-up and order in the pantheon of deities, rituals, implements and practices. This book blithely glosses right over them -- like Doria looking for Nemo in the deep blue sea. <br />On that note, it bears mentioning that the author has a MA in Asian Art from London University's School of Oriental and African Studies, with a major in Japanese Art. My feeling is that the author herself has but a superficial familiarity with the topic at hand.<BR>The author was either brave, reckless, or ignorant to attempt so much with so little. This is unfortunately more of a scansion than a reading, properly speaking. <BR>(Compare Robert Beer's Encyclopaedia for a guide done right.)<br />But to be fair, it might be somewhat helpful to those just beginning their studies and are grabbing at straws.	2004-02-01

I myself am simply awed by the quality that comes through in this edition.<br />What the Buddha said is one thing, what one (usually Ananda) has heard him say is another. And the wobbly wedding cake of an edifice that has come to be known as Buddhism is yet another.<BR>This collection is as close to an English reading person is going to get to what THE MAN really said. And much of what he said is rational, straight-forward, and free of jargon. (What a surprise!)<br />But naturally, as the Suttas were recorded much later after B's death, the text bears all the traits of the mnemonic techniques that were necessary for committing them memory. In other words, there is a lot of repetition in a way that is not unlike the meters used in Homer's Illiad, for example.<br />While the format and size makes this appear as if one ought to be familiar with Buddhism first, I would argue the other way around. It's a mountain of a book: ain't no sense in trying to climb it in a day. Or even in a month. <br />Even a short hike here and there will always be rewarding for those who have a taste and sensibility for ancient poetry, and imagination that will transport them to a time and place when these teachings were given. <BR>In a culture, at a time, when mythical thinking and conception of phenomena were as binding as gravity, Siddhartha's feat of rationality is nothing less than astounding.<br />This translation reads swift and is free of pointless archaisms. Yet it retains the aroma of the Monsoons and thesylvan majesty of the Groves. <br />Go to the mountain or let it come to you: <BR>Stand up next to it and chop it down with the edge of your hand.	2004-01-25
US	51808203	R3UO3ZD0BU54W0	0847824101	41196680	Balthus	Books	5	13	14	N	N	A solid collection of studies	This book is really a must for anyone who wishes to know everything there is \\"available\\" to know about the painter's work and position vis-a-vis modern art in relation to the traditional canon of European painting. <BR>A job of this size would have been simply too much for any one author to handle alone with the degree of thoroughness that was attempted here; and so it was not. Many scholars have come together to shed light on various facets of Balthus' work: reference, method, technique, and influence. Here you will find a rich collection of obscure sketches, out-takes, doodles, and comparisons / parallels with Master paintings.<br />In addition to the essays and studies, every Balthus painting collected in this volume is examined individually but concisely: text on one page with the painting on the other so that one can understand what is being described, and appreciate the work at the same time.<br />HOWEVER, the color reproductions are less than 5 stars. Leans too much to brown/red. If color accuracy is important to you, Claude Roy's is the best so far. So if you love B's work, get both: I did. For the richness of the analyses, this one is hands-down superior, and indispensible. <br />Guy Davenport did some amazing analysis of B's work -- collected in his _Bathus Notebook_ This wonderful work is cited on several occasions and deservedly so. Study B's work better and you will avoid the meretricious vulgrity of applying adjectives like \\"perverse\\" to B's work, or \\"nubile\\" to speak of nudes, as if the word were synonymous with 'erotic,' or 'slim.' The question of  nubility (marriageability) is simply irrelevant, and this book will reward the thoughtful reader by disabusing her of the banality of art-talk cliches and solecisms.<br />If you are more than just an \\"art appreciator,\\" then this volume will help to enrich your understanding of art beyond just Balthus'.	2004-01-15

He has succeeded in presenting things Chinese to be interesting in a way that Western sensibility can (finally) understand. Equipped with vast erudition in both traditions, Jullien sets out to question for the Western mind the significance, ramifications, and benefit of going about doing and saying things in an oblique way.<br />He traces the canonical texts --Lao tse's Taotejing, Lun Yu, Zhuangtse, etc-- in which this sort of sensibility and praxis took on literary form. But as the topic is not a matter of philology but sensibility, he also draws large examples of the oblique as practiced in modern China under Mao.<br />The author writes that he was drawn initially to Chinese studies because, for him, China represented the ultimate Other--not as theory, not as deconstruction, not as rhetoric, but as STRUCTURE. His aim in this study undertaken here is to understand the Chinese way of getting a loose grip on things so as to better \\"control\\" them -- which in \\"Chinese\\" terms would mean, letting 'them' come naturally, ineluctably into the field of one's (secret) intentions, rather than forcing them to obey one's will.<br />Jullien points out the difficulty involved in grasping this \\"Chinese\\" phenomenon lies in the very way in which the Western languages operate. The West's habit is to tackle whatever straight on. Arguments lead to counter-arguments, and the whole agonistic process is hinged on both sides keeping a tight grip of the objective involved in the argumentation. Gong-ans (Koans) from Ch'an (Zen) Buddhism will give you some idea of asking/answering in manner that is utterly different from the Western.<br />Jullien shows how the tradition of logical argumentation in the West is directly related to that of warfare, and the rise of democracy among the Greek city-states. And he contrasts this history with the  Chinese \\"art\\" of war by which an adversarial situation, for example, can be obliquely manipulated to bring the adversary to a condition not of DESTRUCTION but of DESTRUCTURATION. And so on.<br />He makes comparisons with ancient Greece for specific reasons to clarify what he is trying to show, which is something that flies outside the normal range of the Western sensibility/mind's radar. However, he is too sophisticated to go for that naively academic comparison that can only lead to the obvious after several hundred unnecessary pages of belabored indexing: Namely, 'A' is similar to 'B' in these many banal ways but different in those ways.<br />No, Jullien wants to keep his distance so that he may observe and describe that which moves without a clear, calculable vector. His aim is to secure and illuminate that which makes for 'originality,' which for him is another name for none other than 'culture.'<br />By using China as the living model of the Other, he manages to shed light on what in the West remains exceedingly difficult to see for the Westerner. His aim therfore, ultimately, is to create the space necessary for him and the Western reader to see what is truly unfamiliar about the West itself.<br />Refreshing and penetrating. Highly recommended as required reading to all who wish to go beyond the shallow media-hype about globalization and understand what really is necessary for a planetary understanding of humanity's intellectual diversity.dition not of DESTRUCTION but of DESTRUCTURATION.

I first bought this book over ten years ago when it first came out and the book has given me much food for thought as well as appreciation.<br />The Chinese have a lot of tall tales about their greatest painters. One of them goes like this: The emperor had heard of the painter/poet &quot;Wong&quot;'s infernal genius and wanted to see it for himself. &quot;Wong&quot; also happened to be world-class boozer. When he was summoned, he was drunk. He tumbled into the palace where the paper, ink, and brush was laid out for him. He lost his balance and kicked the pot of ink, spilling the content all over the paper. OOPS! No problem. The guy just up and started to paint with the spillage and produced, on the spot, something that was good enough to blow away the emperor.<br />The point of the story, ladies and germs, is this: The Starn Brothers have something of that kind of sensibility and ability. The only difference is, they deliberately kick the inkpot. That is, they accept the finite material condition of their medium and just run with it. Sure the negs are going to fade, wrinkle, even get scratched if you're not super careful handling them. They just said, F- it.<br />Commonly used expressions, such as, &quot;challenging the convention&quot; or &quot;pushing the envelope&quot;, etc., are always unbearably trite, and in this case egregiously so. These guys are not out to do that, I don;t think. They use a lot of images taken from Master paintings, including Rembrandt's portraits  and  Philippe de Champagne's monumental &lt;Dead Christ&gt;.<br />The Starn Brothers' work have that mesmerizing quality -- much of that power comes from their own talent to put together the &quot;right&quot; images in new ways. But a part of that power also comes from the classical images themselves. (Apropos to this comment, they also use Picasso's work, but it's not as moving.)<br />Their work has moved into different realms recently but the core is still there, only more solar. Their work restores faith that there is still so much BEAUTY out there for art to discover, that art in our time does NOT have to be some tiresome social or personal one-liners about how crappy/ironic/unjust/stupid the world is. The discerning eye (prajna), technique (rationality), true love (as opposed to neurosis) for their work: they are all there but without the oppressive mastery and finality.

This collection of essays and book reviews belongs in the library of all serious students of Buddhism. This book contains the short studies of a mature scholar who understood the nuts and bolts of the engine of Buddhism as well as the technical language in which the \\"manual\\" was written.<br />While the field may have become more crowded with more players since Conze left it, Conze's style and standard of scholarship is a model still worth emulating for all (Western) students of Buddhism. The essays collected here range from general overview of Mahayana to specific themes found in the Prajnaparamita, to comparisons to parallels in European philosophy, to Buddhism's  realtionship to Gnosticism, to social implications of logical thinking, and more. His reviews of books, many of them now classic and basic fare for those in the field, are also very insightful. Clearly, Conze did not see eye to eye with Herbert Guenther, that other giantic student of Buddhism, on many an issue.<br />These essays will benefit mainly those who are already seriously committed to Buddhism and Buddhist studies. Not recommended for beginners.	2003-12-31

It is a brief, pit-stoppy tour of some of the key cities of the West, coupled with sociologial descriptions of people's behavior in them. The idea is that the conception of the body went hand-in-hand with the built environment, and vice versa. Chicken and the egg.<br />The historical tour does have some profitable moments: The Greeks thought men were men by virtue of having more body heat and thus it was a manly thing to wear as little as possible and hang out in the front part of the house where it was drafty, while the womenfolk with smaller fires in their bellies huddled to warmed themselves in the back.<BR>Harvey's discovery of blood circulation becomes a city planning concept in the 19th century and revolutionizes urban space as our forebears we know it. Etc.<br />The really interesting thing here is the physiological model that always looms in the metaphor of city as body. The author, like many modern persons, gives you the impression that while the ancients had a great sense of space and community, they were off on their understanding of human physiology. If only he were more familiar with the theoretical foundation of Chinese medicine! Perhaps then he would not think that the Greeks were so entirely wrong in their conjectures, even if they did not formulate them so clearly.<br />The entire thesis of the book builds up to the assertion that we moderns are lost and have no idea what makes for a great city, by which he means a gathering of spaces that reflect and \\"celebrates\\" (god, I hate that word used in that way!) a solid sense of community and belonging. But this conclusion is not surprising since the author's entire oeuvre for the past 30 years has been centered around the very same idea of modern alienation and its causes.<BR>So, read it for the tour,but don't base your own conclusions on Sennett's. The real value of the book lies in its introduction of topics that you'd do well to go research on your own elsewhere. Especially good for undergrads under a good teacher.	2003-12-31

Or, The Anatomy of Schadenfreude. That would have seriously limited its appeal to the average reader perhaps. (So it's just as well that the title parallels the recently very popular, but not so good, book called When Bad Things Happen to Good People.)<BR>But, the fact is, that really is the content of the book, and fascinating and delightful it is. The prose style is crystal and orderly, almost like a serious dissertation that went through a top-notch editor (although there is a typo here and there, but who's counting?). <BR>This emotion that has no proper English name is dissected not only in a variety of ways, but also at a variety of angles, revealing unexpected relationships between this pecadillo and our construct of justice. For example, Do we take pleasure in the justice that is served when one who &quot;deserves&quot; it gets his/her comeuppance? Or is it that we take pleasure in the knowledge that we were lucky enough to have been spared the same nasty spill of fate? Is Schadenfreude the same thing as malice? What about the element of anticipation? Even if we may not consciously wish any person any harm, but still find it somewhat pleasurable to discover that so-and-so was laid-off or demoted, are we guilty? Why is that some tiny little part of us &quot;dies&quot; when our friends succeed, and do better than we do?<BR>How is Schadenfreude different from envy, malice, jealousy, and resentment? <BR>Questions such as these and many more are carefully examined by cross-referencing Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, and modern scholars of ethics, including John Rawls. Complex theme but Portman is a gentleman scholar, goes out of his way (albeit effortlessly) to make clear all his references.	2003-12-30

The spirit with which this book is written, makes it a sort of lesser cousin to Louis Aragon's Treatise on Style.<br />The content basically traces the (political and economic) history of the problem of getting rid of human excrement and other bodily productions, including, ultimately, foul language and obnoxious thought -- as defined by the State and Royal Science. Arguing for the paralell between the history of subjectivity and the history of 'merde' in all its multifarious forms, Laporte centers his thesis on the (Freudian) idea that the rise of the subject and subjectivity is intimately tied to the decline of the olfactory sense (the public organ par excellence) and its replacement by the optical (the organ of privation). Laporte explores the subsequent tensions that came to define modernity's agenda in the space between the private nose and the public eye.<br />Discussed here, in a style of writing that is so erratic and meandering (at high speeds) that it comes close to derailing altogether, are Egyptian rites and Roman laws, furniture design, urban planning, and medieval edicts concerning burials (so as to minimize the spread of \\"morbidific rays\\" emitted by the decomposing dead). <BR>Body, bed, building, tomb, and tomes are all examined in their association with the ever-present tyranny/blessing of the cloacal, the miasmic and the mephitic. The problem of properly disposing human 'merde' has consequences far beyond the water closet and beyond the little container (the cranium) that contains that most most fertile producer of foul ideas -- the brain. An excellent peek by way of Poopology to another take on the History of Control. <br />Warning: As the content of this book is not bathroom humor, the illiterate or the poorly educated cannot reasonablyexpect to get any pleasure out of this small but pungent book. Avoid this unless you are familiar with European intellectual history.	2003-12-03

I would have to disagree with them. This is an unusual book, cutting in its honesty and rationality. Written by one of the most vocal and learned critics today, this book argues for something which concerns the life of art and the place of art in life. At some point in his very active career as curator, critic, and museum director, Spalding decided that he had had enough -- enough of trying to the clothes the Emperor was emphatically NOT wearing. In this book he addresses the question of why he has never met anyone who could, with genuine enthusiam and love, say to him, \\"You simply MUST see this\\" about contemporary art. What is behind the alienation of art from life? Why has art become so solipsistic? So onanistic?<br />Just because he wants to see less offensive material in art, Spalding is not therefore out to argue for something underhahdedly smarmy and specious, like the importance of art's being earnest or being accessible to \\"the people.\\" Spalding is by and large impartial in his attitude toward what art used to be, did, and can still do. In other words, he accepts art's aristocratic alliance as a matter of historical fact. He also accepts the break with tradition that modern art had to accomplish in order to open new horizons. Spalding is neither a condescending snob nor a churlish champion of the hoi poloi, but he presents the situation of today's art as one that has no voice, and no language, to speak to anyone (high or low) but only to its deaf self and a handful of self-appointed members of the pointlessly esoteric priesthood.<br />Spalding has been around a while and has seen much of the making of modern art on both sides of the Atlantic and now tells the story of how, and when (1937) the eclipse of art in our time began so as to put us in total darkness today. But the story he tells is not all gloom and doom. He does not deny that there is great art in our time. But the main focus of his argument is that art has today become, for the most part, something akin to an abomination, and a very tedious and depressing one at that. \\"What is there to really get out of looking at a rotting cow head being eaten by a swarm of flies?\\" he asks rhetorically, referring to what the Tate Modern bought having declared it a significant work of art.<BR>If Spalding seems the odd man out in the art establishment, he probably is. Spalding's stance is simply that of a thinking man who still believes that art's core values are tied to its ability to communicate something about that by which human beings are oriented and reoriented, if strangely, unto some plane of experience most of us feel is higher and more vibrantly life-affirming.<BR>Spalding apparently lacks humor, patience, or artistic acumen, but he just cannot be convinced that human excrement packaged in tin cans is art. And perhaps that's where and how he stands apart from his colleagues at prestigious museums who think nothing of spending $20,000+ for such cans putatively filled with some artist's own excrement. (Not that they ever verified the content.)<br />His argument will have some people throwing eggs and tomatoes at him -- real or cyber -- for not appreciating the spirit of contemporary art. But Spalding presents a very cogent picture of why and how the eclipse -- or a series of eclipses in learning, language, content, and discipline -- came to be historically, and how that eclipse has come to benight art's original and engendering powers.<br />Spalding's vision of art is wide enough, I think, to encompass any medium and style of expression. What he is asking for in art is intelligence. Not cleverness, but intelligence, a show of reflection and care.<BR>What he is arguing against is pseudo-intelligence, pseudo-spirituality, and contrived ideas about creativity. Spalding's argument is not against any particular artists' work but against the entire structure of Byzantine politics and machinations behindthe tyranny of art world's decision-making process. <BR>His plea is one that would have art itself \\"function\\" creatively, not just made in the name of anything-goes. Spalding's general definition of art by way of an attitude is that art is a compression, not just expression, of intelligence, love, observation, insight, reflection, care, and reconfiguration of vital human experience so as to deliver us ultimatley to that realm whose name is now considered taboo to mention: beauty and grace.<br />Spalding's brief analysis of the history of art education in Britain, of Marcel Duchamp's role in the (d)evolution of modern art, and of the reasons behind the rise of Jackson Pollack in the identity-desperate postwar US, and comparison of Pollack's work with that of Edward Hopper are very illuminating even as he tracks the eclipse of art.<br />In Romania a man who had committed suicide by hanging himself in the sculpture garden section of a public park was left hanging for nearly two years because everybody thought it was a \\"work of art.\\" If you think you too might have walked past a dead man thinking it was art just because it was in a \\"art\\" park, then this is a book for you. Highly recommended.	2003-11-27
US	51808203	R2BI8ZYT6YZJNI	0262134152	87921468	Vitruvius: Writing the Body of Architecture	Books	5	7	13	N	Y	Guaranteed to bore the heck...	out of any reader who thinks s/he loves architecture, confusing architecture's greasy, grimy engine of manifestation as a 'built thing' with the SPECTACLE of architecture. The book deals with the ten books by V. It has a lot of Latin, with references to contemporary intellectual influences, namely Stoicism and Pythagoreanism. As much as I respect the author's labor, I must admit, she does get a little dry at times being so sincere (read pedantic) to her calling as a scholar. There is a bit more information than any thinking practitioner of architecture would really need. But then, any thinking architect will know what to cull from this rich feast/tour of the post Civil War Augustan Roman imperium. <BR>So as to not repeat the content of the existing review, I shall speak more of how this book is relevant now by reminding the reader that the structure of the American Imperium is not all that different from the Roman. Just as it was true of Rome, it is still true today that all 'avante-gardes,' despite their rhetoric, work to actually further the Work of Empire. In fact, their very podium on which they utter their battle cries is built into the very structure of Empire.<BR>The current fascination with the idea of 'body' can be, it turns out, traced back to V himself, who was among the very first to use the term 'corpus' to refer to his writing, as well as to architecture. By corpus, he meant 'whole' as opposed to fragments, and there were many commentaries at the time lying about on many a topic, but all in fragments. So V sets out to put it all together into a co-ordinated whole. According to the author, ORDINATIO is a word that crops up often in  V's 10 Books but not as often as RATIO. The book makes it clear why these terms do not carry the meaning when translated into Order and Reason, respectively. This is where the author's surgical description of the Roman conception of the world comes in handy as well as fascinating.<BR>The author, unlike the reviewer, finds her own conclusion &quot;unsettling&quot;: namely that architecture as V defines it for the rest of the Western world henceforth (V distinguished it from 'building') is, by fate, inextricably tied to IMPERIUM. That is, Architecture IS the shadow of IMPERIUM.<BR>As the archetype of Empire's Architect, V speaks for all architects who serve Empire, all Empires everywhere. While this book makes the modest claim to be looking only at the 10 Book's Roman context, the content, if read carefully, will reveal how V's &quot;prophecy&quot; about architecture is coming to fulfillment more today than ever before now that architecture can move so much faster and shift shape with digital ease, having long ago jettisoned the baggage of the 'perfect proportion/body.'<BR>V was the first to write about the central role of machines (especially machines of war (killing) and spectacle (laughter and forgetting)) in architecture. Le Corbusier was perhaps the last &quot;classical&quot; architect to bring the circle of fate to its point of origination with his saying that, &quot;A house is a Machine for Living in.&quot;	2003-10-02

I have this one (vol.1) and the one with the teat-tweaking sisters on the cover (vol.2) If so, so much the better. The authors are generous to call all the paintings collected here for discussion 'great' but what sour soul would fault someone for being too generous? Without quibbling over the adjective then, I would say that just about all the paintings discussed here definitely become more 'great' than they may have been before the reading. Chronologically ordered, the choice of paintings reflect the authors' preference. As well as their prejudice. Some of the really humongously important paintings are left out, while some of the more obscure ones -- so obscure that it is usually attributed to some Netherlandish Master -- are described lovingly. With every painting, we get the big picture of the whole world into which it was born. Then-current language of symbols, now lost on us moderns, is as fascinating as the social practices of those times: For example, Europeans in the Middle Ages thought nothing of exposing their genitals, especially to warm themselves by the fire, and there is a picture to prove it. What's really nice about this way of presenting works of art is that you get the whole package (historical, social, symbolic, technical, biographical, etc) strictly within the context of one painting that is right in front of you. This book is one art book that is finally done right. No pretentiousness, no supercilious or careless assumption on the part of the author that you know what you ought to know about &quot;masterpieces.&quot; Each description is done with real affection for every -- I mean, every -- part of the painting, rather than doing a sweeping thematic summary of the concept. The descriptions read more like stories rather like academic analyses, so they are good to read before going to bed, too. And after each story, you get to feel a little more affection, not awe, for the paintings -- and the people who painted them. Worth every cent.	2003-09-19

Here in plain English, with no bias whatsoever, is the history of one of the most unfamiliar peoples residing in the United States. You have here a detailed but fast-paced account not only of the Amish's origin in Switzerland, Saxony, and the Netherlands in the 16th century, but also of their trials and tribulations in their eventual settling in the New World. Of particular interest to me personally was the historical origins of, and divergence between the Amish and the Mennonites with regard to the question of technology. This book has clarified for me the historical and religious reasons why the Amish have come to choose the way of life they have. I came away from reading this book not only with a deeper understanding of how and why of the Amish (and the Mennonites), but also with a much deeper respect for the genuine humility and modesty the Amish practice in their everyday lives through their work, emphasis on community, and manner of dwelling in harmony with nature. Having lived in Pennsylvania and Ohio for many years, I always believed the Amish to be the only realistic model of a non-monastic community that could convincingly claim to strictly follow the Christian ethos of non-violence and neighborly love. Happily, this book has done much to substantiate much of my own observations about the Amish. But this book is not just about the Amish's past-- in allowing us to to know more about the way the Amish live, and their reasons for it, this short history may give us pause and allow us to re-examine the empty rhetoric of \\"community\\" and \\"empowerment\\" that fills the double-speak of modern politics and many a special-interest group's battle cries. Definitely recommended to anyone interested in a highly successful form of communal living -- one that is not based on a childish rebellion against the modern world, but one based on a childlike acceptance of man's fundamentally naked condition regardless of his technological progress.	2003-06-04

Ingres found Delacroix's work execrable and cast aspersion upon him by saying that: Delacroix was an apostle of ugliness who had come to 'end' painting as the French and the Europeans in general knew it. Today, Delacroix's work occupies a huge chunk of the Louvre's halls -- outstripping Ingre's portion. The fact that Delacroix in fact did fulfill Ingres' curse/prophecy may say something about the nature of death/life and rebirth/resurrection in art.<BR>I read this wonderful book over ten years ago and so powerful was the impact of Delacroix's insights into the nature, perception, creational origin, and fate of art that much of it still remain with me. Delacroix in his day was not revered as he is today. He did not have people knocking down his doors to see his work, nor did he always have it easy trying to show it publicly. One day, after a bad review, to console himself, he wrote that (I paraphase) a great work of art in history is like a plank of wood held under water -- it is kept down when the powers-that-be hold it down. But that power ('political agenda' in contempo art-babble) does not last forever and must sooner or later let go of the plank whose nature is to float to the surface for all the world to see. He seem to have had the same intuition about the nature and fuction of art as the Greeks did: that art is light, that which shines of its own, and by which power that which 'sheds lights' and 'explains' what is around it rather than something that needs to be explained.<BR>He never married but was looked after by a doting housekeeper. Not exactly a recluse, but most certainly a man of breeding descended of a noble stock who was careful about the company he kept, Delacroix spent much time, as artists and thinkers do, with his own thoughts and feelings, and expressing them.He was famous for his cordiality and urbanity, and among his friends in town (Paris) were Chopin, Georges Sand, and other individuals who would leave a mark (or in some cases, a mountain) in the arts one way or another. In other words, Delacroix was an agreeable man and as sociable as any thoughtful man would be but no more. Delacroix's social life is visible in these pages as is the Parisian milieu in which he lived and worked. <BR>But the really great thing about Delacroix's Journals is that one gets to see something about how a great artist sees and feels things. Although he is over a century removed from us, his work and thoughts serve as a reminder that art is not always about anything socially or politically itchy; that art is just art; and that art is not something one needs to get hysterical about or merely a medium to carry an agenda. The fact that, historically, art was always commissioned by the aristocracy, and executed by those who were aristocratic in feeling and sensibility is one that is largely ignored today. Read this and see the significance of this fact, and why the term democratic art is ultimately an ugly oxymoron. Those who would champion the 'demos' sometimes think too highly of art and the need for \\"the people\\"'s participation in it.<BR>In my humble opinion, if Delacroix were alive today, I think he would have loved Rauschenberg's and Jean-Michel Basquiat's work and their strong democratic origins but he would detest the democratization of art as such as found in Van Gogh umbrellas and calendars so loved by those who \\"love\\" art. He wouldn't go to Mozart Festivals either.	2003-05-07

This book really shows that the function of art in our time is that of a collective commentary on the Sutra of Art, and as such necessarily way more verbose than the original \\"sacred\\" text. Here all the eminently forgettable one-liner images made in the name of art, anti-art, art-taboo, and art voodoo throughout history---from all cultures--are gathered and presented in the full glory of their collective greatness.<BR>But, do take note that this book is not an \\"art book\\" as such, and certainly not a coffee table variety. It belongs on your desk along with your dictionaries and encyclopedias. This is a textbook at its finest. The meat of this book is really the essays, with the images---many of them small but very clear-- inserted to augment the discussion, not the other way around. <br />So then what are some of the things discussed? A set of essays is grouped under a particular question, and there are some 12 plus questions that cue you in right away as to what is going to be discussed. It is like having a seminar program showing the topics to be discussed, time, and room numbers.<br />Some of the questions asked and responded to: WHY DO IMAGES TRIGGER SO MUCH FUROR? WHY ARE IMAGES SO AMBIGUOUS? WHY DO GODS OBJECT TO IMAGES? WHAT IS ICONOCLASH? WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO MODERN ART? HAS CRITIQUE ENDED? <br />What intelligent person could possibly resist the temptation to find out what people have said in response to these questions? I would be a liar to say that I have read through every single essay in the book. I have not. But what I have read so far--a huge chunk--have all been very thoughtful and sincere. Now that's rare in a book whose subject matter concerns art-talk!<BR>With over fifty people writing, talking, interviewing, there is a huge range of styles of discourse, some delightful, some witty, some funny, some dry. But, all in all, this is a very thoughtful and timely presentation of an important subject with minimum pretentiousness. As the subtitle indicates, it concerns all who take interest in the problem of images in art, religion, and science. Highly recommended.	2003-03-25

That is why I say the title is misleading--it gives you the impresion that it is more comprehensive than the author ever intended. It took me a while to figure this out and was disappointed on many an occasion, wasting time looking up words this book could not possibly contain.<BR>It should have been titled < A Concise Dictionary of Buddhist Terms found in the Suttas>.	2003-03-23

And as much as I found this book helpful, I also tried to read it from the point of view of someone who might find the whole FS to be a bunch of BS. And I found it to be wanting in clearer explanations, even if only to explain why and how some of these things were beyond rational explanation.<BR>This book IS about color theory and practice as espoused by the Black Hat Sect Tantric Buddhism (BTB) in organizing the environment - micro and macro. By now the interested reader ought to know something about the historical dimensions that shaped the BTB, especially including the Chinese input over the last 1,000 years or so. That said, I can say that this book is helpful only to those who are artistically inclined and/or familiar with, AND accepting of the logic behind Chinese cosmology and cultural symbolisms. Why?<BR>Take for example, the part where the author mentions that the color white for fences is bad and red is best. She recommends a cure that can be had by tying 9 red ribbons to the fence. Okay, let us leave aside for the moment the issue of whether that is \\"true\\" or not, on whatever level. The fact that the author would make such a statement is bound to rub the average American reader the wrong way, which is indeed unfortunate.<BR>The fact that the color white symbolizes death and purity (to the point of permitting no life) to the Chinese is no reason to write off the whole Western practice of investing the color white with other meanings, such as purity (as in chastity), honesty, cleanliness, and new beginning -- all hopeful and positive things.<BR>This book, as good as it could be, makes the same mistake as some of the other bestsellers in assuming that every reader will (have to) simply accept the Chinese cosmology as universal truth. It is not clear why this oversight continues to occur, but it gives the uncomfortable impression that only a particular culture had access to the \\"real\\" truth of colors.<BR>This sort of explanation right from the start would have been helpful to the reader: That the FIVE ELEMENTS merely represent the five MODES of Ch'i, and the names (that is, the elements) associated with them were chosen largely for easier memorization and visualization, and thus application to the visible material world, including medicine. They could just as well have been labeled A,B,C,D, and E. (The subatomic particles also have names that are there just for easier identification. Are electrons really electronic?) The names of the five modes don't really matter, but the manner of their interaction does. The reader should not accept the (pseudo) explanation that \\"metal 'produces' water because water condenses outside a copper pail filled with cold water\\", or that \\"fire 'produces' earth by way of ash\\". Nor should the reader reject it as \\"bad science\\" and forego the more interesting stuff behind the immensely complicated system of observation (as well as observances) in FS. The five elements structure is a mnemonic device before it is anything else but the author does not tell you this, and the disinterested reader is left to follow wide-eyed, marveling at the \\"awesome\\" wisdom of the Chinese; or to reject it without furthur ado as New Age mumbo-jumbo.<br />Given that the BTB puts a lot of emphasis on YI (intention, will), and even in its meditation practices it encourages people to activate whatever religious symbolisms with which they feel most at home, it would only makes sense to assure the Western reader that the purpose of Feng Shui is to activate the energy (Ch'i) of one's environment in harmony with one's own psychic disposition, which would certainly include one's own traditional orientation and inculcation of values -- ethical and aesthetical.<br />This book, I think, can confuse as well as enlighten, depending on the reader's own level of intutional development. Those who are too uncritically enthusiastic about FS so as to accept everything written here, may end up with a mess of colors all over their house. If it's true that 'You can take a horse to the water but you can't make him drink', then it's also true that if you're the horse, you have to figure out just how thirsty you are, and for what.<br />All in all, this is a good book, but if you are trained to think critically, it may not be the best book out there for you....	2002-04-19

Just to be fair: The book is not exhaustive but nor is it \\"tabloid\\" as one reviewer put it. And it is certainly not \\"soft porn\\". There is nothing \\"lurid\\" in these pages. The writing is, as the more fair-minded reviewer suggested, restrained in a respectful way, to all parties concerned.<BR>This brief account does not set out to describe the impact the affair had on the two individuals' respective work. For anyone to demand such an account seems to me totally unreasonable: That a private passion of the heart always impacts one's intellectual work is by no means a given.<BR>What this book shows you, regardless of the subjective tinge the author may have imposed on the characters in question, is the mystery of the workings of the heart. Ettinger sketches a portrait of a woman in love but not just any woman, but a woman of exceptional intelligence, expansive soul, and loyalty -- to her own ideals of friendship. Cloying speculations concerning the psychological causes -- childhood traumas, etc -- that may have led these two individuals to live and love the way they did are left out and the book is the more elegant and tactful for it.<BR>To call Arendt a naif for the way she allowed herself to be \\"abused over and over again\\" would be to admit to total lack of understanding of the very nature of love. Arendt shows over and over her desire, need, psychosis -- choose your favorite term -- to forgive a man who in many ways was unforgiveable. Love does that.<BR>In this double portrait of two people who happened to be academic thinkers, some 50 years is rendered as if it were a day. Heidegger comes off here as a man not above the sort of pettiness and calculation you and I lapse into occasionally, while Arendt is portrayed, without forcing any evidence to this purpose, as the kind of woman who could leave behind a legacy of not only of thinking but also of loving in the grand style. Great and important as Heidegger may be in the history of western philosophy, he may, alas, verywell have been one of those gnomish professors we've all come across in our lives: brilliant and thus all the more annoying when they put their intelligence and intellect in the service of self-serving calculation. This book, written in clear prose and balance, confirms the disturbing (and disappointing) fact character and thought are not always equally winged.<BR>Forget the names of the characters involved. Read it as a document of a love that would have made a great B&W movie as well, with the late Ingrid Bergman as Arendt, and Mickey Rooney as Heidegger.	2002-03-09

The picture quality is less than tops, and there are even teeny-weeny unreadable B&amp;W photos that are attached to supposedly famous names. It kind of gives you the impression that the author was either running out of material to fill the book with or had too many friends who wanted a piece of the action.<BR>If the only thing in common that is supposed to hold all the projects under one roof is that they are all 'radical', well, the author ought to choose another word, even if a more etymological meaning was intended by it (Radix, Latin, root).<BR>I bought it at full retail price and feel I've been jipped, but at half the price, I suppose it's worth having...It's a CATALOGUE, basically.	2002-01-10

The theme of the conversation is violence in the modern world, its origin, its meaning and its various forms of manifestation. Mr.Carriere does a great job of keeping the conversation lean but muscular. As the man who put together on film the massive _MAHABHARATA_, Carriere is familiar with Indian and Buddhist material and does the reader a very competent service by introducing a page here a page there of explanation and/or a commentary, giving an older Hindu context for the Buddhist concepts. This is not an &quot;interview&quot; but a real conversation that a couple of mutually respecting friends might have. That's what makes the book so lively. Carriere at one point even chides Dalai Lama for simplifying the West as &quot;mechanistic&quot;. Moreover, Carriere speaks not only for himself, but perhaps also for a reader who may not find Buddhist cosmology -- in terms of rebirth and reincarnation, etc -- so readily acceptable. It is when such a(n opposing) point of view is introduced that the Dalai Lama shows how and why Buddhism is so pragmatic: BUddhism is not a &quot;religion&quot;, he says. It is a science of the Mind. It has no doctrines, no dogmas to maintain AGAINST common sense and empirical data. Buddhism is a science with a vast amount of data concerning the Mind and techiques of access. But as the research was done for over at least 2500 years, in a particular setting, in a particular material, psychological condition, Buddhism would also naturally reflect a set of behaviors and &quot;beliefs&quot; of those local environments in their totality. Thus, what is not applicable in the modern world, Buddhism is ready to modify or jettison. For example, certain manner of representation to illustrate a spiritual and/or social point (instituion of marriage, sexual conduct, various ceremonial protocol, etc). The Dalai Lama even states that Buddhism would relinquish even the notion (which for him and for millions of practicing Buddhists a reality) of rebirth IF science ever gets around to PROVING it conclusively.<br />The Dalai Lama makes it very clear on several occasions that humanity must now move toward a spiritual life as opposed to a religious life. (They are not the same.)<BR>The problem of over-population is discussed as the main cause of violence done to the earth, thus to the entire cosmos, causing more greed, more desperation.<BR>Carriere is more openly critical of the Vatican's position over this issue. The Dalai Lama agrees that the virtue of the commandment to &quot;go forth and multiply&quot; must be heeded within the context in which we seek guidance from such a religious tradition. And that context is always Here and Now, thus putting into question the sanity of following blindly such a &quot;commandment&quot; today when there are 5 billion of us; when we cannot be guaranteed the required space necessary for a spiritual upgrade. The Dalai Lama is harshly critical of the mindset that only looks at figures; those &quot;experts&quot; who claim the earth can feed as many as 10 billion. Fed? Then what? What will they all do, to what purpose, at what quality of life, he asks.<BR>The previous reviewer mentioned something that I think needs a qualification. No, the Dalai Lama is neither an &quot;atheist&quot; nor a &quot;theist&quot; and the whole issue is very complicated. Buddhism has its own complex pantheon of deities. Traditionally, Buddhism's response to the question concerning the idea of a creator god is one of silence. Buddhism basically says, you will never know by intellectual inquiry. Moreover, even if such a god existed, it doesn't concern you: It won't help YOU to do YOUR homework. <BR>Also, Buddhism has a tradition of turning away anyone who is too enthusiatic to become a Buddhist on a whim. Don't think it's for you just because you're an atheist. Think about it a little longer, son.<BR>Buddhist pragmatism in a nutshell. Highly recommended.	2001-12-30

A book like this...a review thereof for whom?<BR>A certain amount of &quot;familiarity&quot; with Jackie's style of writing will probably be necessary to get into these three short essays around (and whatever other prepositions you care to put in) the theme of the name, naming, saving the name, keeping the name safe, and the name's refusal to be called by a name.<BR>The first of the essays is titled &quot;Passions&quot; and is the most fragmented of the three in terms of delivery. A bit taxing, really. By way of introduction, Jack commits an abduction by way of &quot;apophasis&quot; -- a kind of an irony, whereby we deny that we say or do that which we especially say or do (OED) -- to bring about the idea of the passions of secrets: Secrets not by being hidden nor by being shared by a privileged few, but the kind that is open to all, perhaps taking on the form of a non-secret.<br />The second essay has a little more to sink one's teeth into. The subject is &quot;negative theology&quot; as such, or the (im)possibility thereof. A very penetrating reading of Angelus Silesius' The Cherubinic Wanderer.<br />The third essay, &quot;Khora&quot; -- non-placeable place, the third genus -- is a reading of Plato's notion of that &quot;mother&quot;, &quot;nurse&quot;, &quot;the Receiver&quot; that gives place for all that &quot;takes place&quot;: A placing, a positing of displacement and differance, a displacement by way of oscillation between two types of oscillation: the double exclusion(neither/nor) and the participation(both this and that).<br />In short, this collection of essays opens up another (that is to say, the very same) horizon of thinking toward what used to be under the care of religion, and as such can be rewarding reading to those who are already aware of the necessity of reworking the language of absence without resorting to what was once named &quot;mysticism&quot;. If Nagarjuna were born into the French language in the 20th century, he'd probably speak like this.<br />The writing on the back cover says that the last essay will be of particular interest to those in the burgeoning fields of &quot;space studies&quot;(architecture, urbanism, design). Interest? Maybe. Clarity and enlightenment? I wouldn't bet my lunch money on it myself.	2001-11-16

But by no means is it a history of nothing. It tells the story of how the zero was invented in India (perhaps out of philosophic necessity demanded by Vedic cosmology), then traveled over to the Arab world, giving birth to al-gebra eventually, and later still, arriving in Europe in the very early dawn of the Renaissance. That much we know. Rotman goes on to discuss the havoc the little non-number that was so incomprehensible to the Romans(they didn't have a symbol for it) wreaked on the European world-view. Among its doings: The deconstruction of the flat planar pictorial representation of the Midle Ages into a proto-cyber 3-D optical illusion by way of the vanishing point, another manifestation of the zero, in pictorial terms. The zero is shown to have gone on to radically alter the concept of money, its management, generation, and financial exchange following the rise of paper money with lots of zero's on 'em. Something we now take for granted was not always that way and Rotman shows the roadblocks set up by the Hellenic-Roman-Christian cosmologies that prevented earlier appropriation of the concept in the western world. <BR>&quot;Nothing comes of Nothing!&quot;, cried King Lear.<BR>Speaking of King Lear, he is invoked in the book as well as Montagigne, the Kabbalah, Vermeer's paintings, and Renaissance architectural perspectives.<BR><BR>In short, the zero and its manipulation is what made possible the rise of the West as the engine of modernity. The idea of Nothing, numerically represented as zero (invented to keep Infinitity company), is (or was) of course the sine qua non of the East. But in the West it was and still is, by and large a metaphysical albatross around the neck of many a thinker, despite their ability to manipulate it like nobody before them. How ironic that the zero is what made the possibility of total annihilation possible in our time.<BR><BR>This book, with its erudition-lite, allows you to think about how the Vedic origin of the zero might relate to the idea put forth by Sloterdyjk in his &quot;Critique of Cynical Reason&quot;. Namely, that for the West, the nuclear missile in its silo is the Buddha -- in its infinite stillness, silence, acceptance of the inevitable, and self-negation. The bomb is the zero manifest awaiting its ecstasy to come on ground zero.<BR>There are other books out there on the theme of zero but I think this one is most philosophically thought-provoking.	2001-10-31

This book is as stunning in its unexpected insights as it is diffcult to summarize. Agamben's mastery of classical philosophy and philology gives him the advantage of discussing pressingly modern issues in philosophy, history, politics and criticism as personified in the works of everyone from Aristotle to Heidegger, Benjamin, and Derrida. And that advantage is apparent not only in the ease with which he brings Aristotle's discussion of dynamis (potentiality) on the issue of redemption and Being, but also in the vividness of ancient philosophy's immediate relevance to the discussion of the messianic notion of time and history as transmitted to our age through figures such as Kafka, Benjamin and Scholem.<BR>This collection of essays is divided into three parts: Language, History, Potentiality. Each section has under it a number of essays loosely pertaining to that category. Under the section on Histroy, for example, we have essays on Aby Warburg and the man's legacy in the refiguration of the study of art history; on Tradition; on Hegel's Absolute and Heiddeger's Ereignis; on Walter Benjamin's Angel of History; and on Benjamin's rumination on the Messiah in realtion to the Sovereign.<BR>Heiddeger looms, as always, over much of Agamben's writing, but here so does that which has no name except as a tradition that partakes of the kabbalistic power of deep vision. The content of the book is offered here like so many spores of light, shedding light on so much of what constitutes the abyss/ground of modernity, but resisting capture in the stiff net of unimaginative academic argumentativeness. The prose is as dense as usual, reflecting the very density of the topics the author is trying to analyse. A most head-on collision of a reading.	2001-09-13

Rykwert is a scholar of the first rank, and it is the mark of a superior scholar to write in such a way as to cull the most arcane information from another field and trim, dry, boil, knead and package it for easy swallowing without sacrificing any of the wisdon-enhancing ingredients. Other books dealing with the same theme have preceded Rykwert's own book. F.W Jackson Knight's &lt;Vergil: Epic and Anthropology&gt; and Fustel de Coulanges' &lt;The Ancient City&gt; are exemplary for their intensity of imagination and obliquity of perspective. And like its predecessors, Rykwert's book takes you on a brief, but a grand tour of the ancient world. That is to say, it shows you just what was so grand about the ancient world and the ancient mind's response to the cosmos in its orientation with regard to &quot;worlding&quot;. The book deals with the ancient practice, especially Roman, of founding a city. Rykwert shows you in plain language the profundity and density of religious and mythopoetic factors that used to go into the act of founding a city. But, this book is not about something that once was. It is about that which always IS in Architecture. The Roman poet Sallust said of myths, &quot;these things never happened, but are always.&quot; This is what Rykwert gets at in describing the actual mechanisms and the machines that appear as gods, herms, gates, etc, in ancient Mediterranean constructions of the world. World: Mundus, in Latin. The chthonic gateway to the underworld, the big gaping vaginal hole in the middle of the site where the town is to be erected. The final chapter discusses the symbolic parallels found in other traditions.<BR>This book is not optional reading for those who would pretend to practice architecture, or for those who want to understand the origin/destiny of the relationship between &quot;art&quot; and &quot;religion&quot;, between the Apollonian and the Dionysian in Western culture. I recommend Camille Paglia's &lt;Sexual Personae&gt; for a richer and wider and literary understanding of the implication of Rykwert's thesis as it applies to the whole cultural trajectory of the Occident's history. By the way, the sales rank of this book, and that after 25 years, no architect (practitioner, student, consumer) has bothered to write a review of this indispensible work only further fan my misgivings concerning the two thing I know about my own profession: intellectual vapidity of the license wielding practitioners and the miasmic cabalism of the academics.	2001-09-02

If you are already familiar with Girard's work concerning the relationship between mimetic desire and violence, sacrificial rites and scapegoat, then you will find this book indispensible. If you have an opinion -- pro or con -- about Christianity, you will want to read this book. The title of the book is a quote from Mathew 13, 35, and not without purpose. Here, Girard discusses in depth the nature of Christianity, the most sacrificial religion, in terms of the theories he's been formulating over the years. The whole business of murder and deification permeates much of primitive Mediterranean religions -- Abel and Cain, Romulus and Remus, etc -- and the sacrifice of Christ and subsequent deification follows the same pattern of displacing mob guilt. Biblical exegesis, certainly, but much more than that. This book and Girard's work as a whole helps one to understand above and beyond the question of either sentiment or faith why Christianity as a religion still holds sway in this secular age, and from where it derives its staying power. A real milestone in intellectual detective work, it will cause you to hear a wake-up call. And in stereo, too, if you read also his good friend Michel Serres' book ROME: The Book of Foundations.	2001-08-19

The first part will be particularly helpful to those who do not know the Chinese language in the way it shapes and articulate thought for those who think in Chinese. The entire cosmology upon which medical theories and perceptions have been formulated is laid out as a reflection of the mirror (language) that bears the warpature to best suit the Chinese language. The first part ably shows how the fact that Chinese does not have temporal tenses in its grammar affects the shaping of premises with regard to the body and medicine in Chinese worldview. Food and Chinese cooking are also introduced as important vehicles that have carried Chinese medicine through its path of evolution. The latter part of the book deals with more theoretical concepts, including philosophy, and how they gave rise to and founded certain clinical practices. The book is an organic introduction to a science that is founded and corrected on the lived experience of thousands of cases observed over two thousand years.	2001-08-11

Gracian does not moralize -- he is one of those charcters in history who taught Nietzsche the idea of morals beyond good and evil. Gracian does not hand you formulas for success or self-improvement, as such. He merely shows you the psychology of human beings when placed in various situations, and ways to avoid stepping on doo-doo. In that sense, this book is sort of the European version of Sun-Tze's The Art of War but seemingly easier to approach if only by reason of proximity of cultural sensibilty. Message? &quot;A well-lived life in the world of men is to be had in avoiding getting damaged and damaging others over petty things WHILE maximizing your leverage toward realizing your ambitions. Don't let vanity and ego cloud your judgement.&quot; The great book that it is, it has something to say to everyone in every station in life.	2001-07-03

Thus for the American reader the very notion that the modern age may be \\"illegitimate\\" somehow may ring hollow, if not outright absurd. This book defends the status of the modern age against any suggestion that somehow it may be an aberration, a condition gone awry. The modern age, in all its seeming anti-religious tendencies fueled especially by the scientific drive for the truth, is the 'legitimate' heir to the tradition of taking literally to heart,\\"Ye shall know the Truth, and the Truth shall set you free\\". This book focuses on the philosophical foundations of Medieval theology and Nominalism that paved the way for secularization in the modern age. Blumenberg, with his astonishing scholarship and intellectual prowess makes it clear that, intentionally or not, much of what passed for pious and official christian theology during the middle ages actually had very little to do with \\"religion\\" per se (Christ's ethical teaching), and everything to do with Greek philosophy, especially Aristotle's, under the guise of church dogma. In serving theology, attributes of God in His omnipotence and omniscience were framed around the notion of absolutes, leading to unresolvable contradictions and paradoxes. For example, the idea that God should be omnipotent necessarily meant He ought to be capable of creating a rock so heavy that even He cound not lift it. This book is simply the most facinating and in-depth account of the strange doings of the Church Fathers in their relentless quest for the Truth. Blumenberg shows that it was ultimately the Church, in allowing astronomy as one of the topics to be studied, while forbidding others (curiosity itself was considered a sin, an 'extra-vagance', meaning, 'going outside the path'), providedthe very possibility that led to secularization of the modern age. According to the author, the Church formulated its dogma primarily in response to and against Gnosticism, but failed in completely eradicating all the Gnostic elements, thus laying itself open to \\"infection\\" later on. The return of Gnosticism takes on the form of science, which makes a virtue of being clear about what it does not and cannot know, and questions the ground of any claim that arrogates omniscience. This work makes a compelling case for our age: For better or for worse, the fate of the modern age was decided a long time ago when the West became Christendom. ....	2001-06-15

In deftly describing the organic connection between economic well-being and the production of culture, Cowen essentially affirms the need and the justification for being optimistic about our present state of culture, at least as far as creative output is concerned. He argues against and explains the origin of cultural pessimists and their rhetoric, which the author sees as understandable but not necesssarily correct. That is, not as correct as these pessimists would have you believe. The section on the visual arts is particularly rich with historical vignettes of artists and their way of doing business to get the work out and at the same time try to make some money. This book would be particulary good reading for artists -- in whatever medium -- who are often, too often, trained to see their work and that of others as critics would, rather than as artists and creators, who have bills to pay, not just inspiration to concretize. Cowen does a great job of condensing amusing anecdotes culled from dozens of art history books (most of which, let's face it, can be pretty tedious for the most part). Cowen makes a convincing argument that today, as an artist, one can be as esoteric as s/he likes and still find an audience, BECAUSE the economic structure of commercialism is in place to the extent that it is. In citing examples of artists who managed to become millionaires in their time (Michaelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Mozart, Monet, etc), the author argues that being successful does not have to mean \\"selling out\\". Of course, in the process, he also implicitly argues against the ingrained prejudice people have against the idea of \\"selling out\\". Let the market and humanity's better judgement do their job of sorting it all out in the end : Only the excellent survives, and what is excellent in an artwork operates independently of the magnitude of popularity. Thus, the author lays out his reasons for the need to be more embracing of new genres of art by accepting the possibilitythat new stuff may one day be \\"classics\\", just as much of what we call \\"classics\\" today acquired their present status although they did not start out that way when they were born. By profession, the author is an economist, who apparently takes a great interest in the arts, and is concerned enough about seeing them flourish in diversity to say: Thanks to the market driven economy we have in an economic structure (for better or worse) that goes by the name of capitalism, more than ever before, artists can be as good as they wanna be doing their \\"thang\\", and still have a shot at being handsomely remunerated. Art is about pleasure, Cowen says. The pleasure of perception, sensation, feeling, provocation, inspiration, ideas, regardless of the kind. Even cultural whiners whine, with learned diction, because it gives them pleasure, much pleasure, to complain about how things are nowadays.	2001-06-06
US	51808203	R3DE5QOPJXPS32	0374518203	533881186	Crowds and Power	Books	5	158	172	N	N	monumental, weird, funny, sobering	That the author won the Nobel may suade the reader one way or another. But as this work is what got him the prize, which to me says the Nobel must be worth something. If you don't know Canetti's work, you won't get the impression from the title that the man is incredibly funny. But he is. And yet his brand of humor comes only from surgical-precise observation of the ordinary. Canetti is the Montaigne of our time, of modernity, bearing all the marks and scars of our age. If Canetti's prose has the disarming rambling style that we associate with Montaigne's, it also has the latter's power to draw out the most unexpectedly profound from the ordinary. Sort of like old fencing masters: they never run, never sweat, are never fancy, but they always beat you to the jugular. All the scholarship,all the discipline is hidden, like the hull of a ship that keeps the whole thing afloat. In this book, without torturing language, Canetti tells you more about the nature of power than Foucault, and more about the nature of crowds than a room full of social psychologists. (That such a feat is possible ought to be a sobering lesson in itself!) Canetti's book is a wonderful mix of the potentially tedious (kangaroo behavior) and the...funky. For example, in describing the psychology of mass fear as it relates to its twin, the desire to out-survive others, he cites unexpected examples: burial customs in rural India in which a strenuous attempt is made to appease the spirit of the child if it dies a preventable death; the peculiar madness of Roman emperors; and the Viking warriors' tradition of piling up a mound of stones before going into battle. Each warrior brings a stone and adds to the pile. After battle, each warrior removes one stone, thus leaving a mound of stones that would represent the dead. Contemplating by the fire the remaining mound was immensely satisfying to the survivors, apparently. Canetti's notion of the crowd is never just a bunch of people. Canetti defines crowd as acumulation of small units into a large ensemble, causing it to become something entirely different from the units that make it up. He sees nature as the teacher that taught man to behave as a crowd, as a liquid. For example, for the Germans, it is the forest with its innumerable trees, standing vertically, that has inspired the German soul since time primordial in its aspiration to become a marching liquid. For the Arabs, it is the sand of the desert. For the Dutch, it is the threatening sea itself. For the Mongols, the wind. Etc. Canetti's prose is muscular, never bloated. Given that he was a man of letters, and not an anthropologist, it may be of some significance that his lifelong project -- it took him some 30 years to write this book -- was shaped by his lifelong preference for a world as envisioned by the ancient Greeks and the ancient Chinese in matters literary, moral, and philosophical. His science is the science of a man confident in his experience and aristocratic power of observation. Canetti never sets out to convince. He has nothing to sell. It is his style to simply put it in front of you, and then leave. Take it or leave it, but this book will never leave you once you begin it.	2001-05-31

That's because this work belongs to that rank. I first read this book back when I was in grad school, and have used it as a reference ever since. If a 'classic' -- if we may dare use such a term still -- is something akin to a great poem as Ezra Pound defined it, &quot;News that stays new&quot;, then this work is a classic.  Arendt must have been a great teacher as well as a thinker. These essays read like lectures: Lectures given by a caring professor who actually gives a damn about getting through to her audience.  Yes, some Greek and Latin here and there, but with Arendt as your guide you cannot get lost if you pay attention. The subtitle of the book is Eight Exercises in Political Thought, and Arendt, in her grand style, deals with the big topics -- Freedom, Authority, Power, Tradition, etc -- that ground everything else in civic life. The sheer pleasure to be had in encountering the density of her scholarship is found not only in her crystal clear prose, but also in her mastery of the foundational concepts and experience, Roman and Greek, that shape, willy nilly, the warpature within the space of our civic and political discourse even today. However, in her presentation of the trajectory of tradition, she also shows exactly where and how the displacement of tradition occurred. In the opening lines of her essay 'What is Authority?', she asks whether we ought not instead be asking 'What WAS Authority?', making clear from the get go that the notion of Authority has undergone an irreversible transformation since the Roman conception. And then she goes on to explain how that change occurred and in what way, with what chain of consequences. This book is noteworthy not only for its content and inimitable delivery, but also as a model of intellectual &quot;exercise&quot;. The calmness, the steady architectural build-up of the argument, attention to philological detail when it's called for,all make up Arendt's generous style of writing and thinking. But that generosity is especially evident in this collection of essays. This is one of those rare books that, if read well, will actually make you more thoughtful. And smarter. Besides, you get to pick up some Greek and Latin for free.	2001-05-29
US	51808203	R20JJVVRJU252H	0262691663	802489204	What Is Architecture? An Essay on Landscapes, Buildings, and Machines	Books	4	3	3	N	Y	A regular bloke chatting about architecture	I give it four stars although if judged strictly by its content alone, it's worth maybe three and a half. But given the sheer volume of intolerable turgidity, confusion and pretentiousness in architectural writing out there, this book is like a breath of fresh air in its regular-bloke-rambling style of writing. The author is British and there is some Brit slang as well as references to British examples and geography. This may hinder understanding somewhat if one is not familiar with places and life in the UK. The content does ramble a bit, and the intensity of focus is not quite there. Topics raised are never quite pursued to the depth the author seems to be capable of. Nonetheles, the author does everyone in the field of architecture a favor by reminding one that architecture is not about buildings alone, but about the structuring of three things, all strangely intangible and formless: landscapes, buildings, machines. Desires, really, rather than things. He cites Vitruvius as evidence that that's the way architecture was conceived from the beginning. The book is a teaser of sorts, and does have moments of real poetic insights about the subject matter. The book has spurred me to think about certain things that the author himself does not mention. For example, the consequence of Vitruvius's definiton of machine as 'cyclice kinesis', circular motion. Chatty, yes, but still not really for the layman. Which is just as well, since only architects read architecture books. Very British in the framing of the issue and very AA in presentation. On the whole, the book reads like a document of the author's speculations about things and questions concerning that bloody thing called architecture. I just wonder if he should not have titled the book, What WAS Architecture? Well, do ya now?!Roight,then. Cheers, mate!	2001-05-25

Something like that is taking place here. The title alone is enough to pique your interest, but the content is less than secret-divulging. If you're not a neurologist,or a specialist in a related area,then much of the material presented by the neurologist will be for all practical purposes useless. If you're not familiar with the basic assumptions of esoteric buddhist psychology, then much of what HH Dalai Lama has to say will sound like so much dogma or articles of faith. I know next to nothing about brain sciences, but am academically acquainted with the buddhist conception of reality, so I found what the Dalai Lama had to say both interesting and amusing. Interesting, because he speaks as plainly as he can about things that are usually wrapped in some hairy buddhist language. Amusing, becuase the Dalai Lama would show utmost courtesy in listening to all the dry academic presentations, which even I found somewhat tedious, and then offer his views about the matter at hand by often beginning with what sounds like a gentle correction rather than a positing of difference of perspective only. I paraphrase from memory: &quot;Well, your numbers and theories are all very nice, but no, it's actually like this.&quot; Some of the discussions on REM, and animal responses to dream states are interesting, but just merely interesting. Better on the Discovery channel. Much of the philosopher Charles Taylor's presentations concerning the Western/Christian conception of the Self is reliable but elementary. And dealing with the subject matter at hand, even an eminent philosopher can do only so much with Ratio alone. The book is of some value if one is willing to be open to the possibility that the Dalai Lama may be speaking of things that are real but not measurable, at least not with knobs and dials. Not yet. He never mentions it specifically in the book, but the idea of rebirth and the attendant conditions are indirectly there, for example when he questions the authenticity of the phenomenon of seeing one's departed ones in a near-death experience. He says, &quot;Maybe the person is hallucinating at that point or projecting a wish. They (the loved ones who departed long ago) would have found new bodies by then.&quot; Taken as an record of an encounter with the Dalai Lama, this book sheds some light into that aspect of the man that won't show up when he is on Larry King or speaking of compassion to the multitude in Central Park. The guy is a professional in his own field, after all, and he knows his chops. Here, refreshingly enough, he sheds some of his avuncular &quot;hey, be cool, people!&quot; image and divulges some of his professional knowledge at a speed and intensity of delivery considerably higher than the mass media have shown him to be capable.	2001-05-25

Mr. Miller does a marvelous job, writing in laid back but eminently readable prose that is also judiciously scholarly, describing, explaining, or just tossing up speculations about a culturally modified body of reaction that provokes the &quot;Ee~oo,gross!&quot;. The subject has been handled before, obviously, judging by all the references he makes to the various studies, some recondite, some classic, including Mary Douglas' and Freud's. The book reads like an intimate seminar, with the author citing immediate examples from his own life, and casually but appropriately pointing out things done by his own children. Miller makes it clear from the get go that his study is necessarily restricted to the study of the phenomenon as shaped and defined by the culture and class to which he belongs: WASP with a roundedly informed grasp of his own tradition and values. In that sense, the book makes no claim to be universal, a disclaimer that stands out as an act of virtue in contrast to much of disgustingly pompous academic sweepers out there. Nonetheless, the author does manage to bowl pretty well, getting a strike here and there in terms of observation concerning the qualities that, for all practical purposes, are universally recognized to be those of the disgusting. I use the term 'universal' as it applies today, what with globalization and all. Yes, coprophagy (eating of feces) is indulged in by some for thrills, but I doubt anyone practices drooling saliva into a cup and then drinking it back up. The author suggests that it may not be too much to credit the invisible structure of human social evolution to the distancing of two points, YUCK and YUM. The culturo-environmental determination of the length between those two points may very well contain much of what it takes to delimit a culture's potential for art, science, and language as well. The book contains what everyone already knows (too well!) but never bothered to articulate for him/herself. There is much here to delight the inner pre-pubescent in us all, but it is a serious book, nevertheless. After all, in the grown-up world, it is not the gooey, slimy stuff so much as the ethical defect in the form of gooey, slimy character and corresponding actions that make us think,&quot;EE~oo! Gross!&quot; A nice companion to Sloterdijk's The Critique of Cynical Reason.	2001-05-23
US	51808203	RWV00KLFKOAEQ	0942299884	352892473	The Expressiveness of the Body and the Divergence of Greek and Chinese Medicine	Books	4	29	38	N	N	Clear but only within the narrow of scholarly language	The author is to be commended for doing a service, not only to the medical community, but to all who would seek a greater understanding of how perception feeds and shapes knowledge as such. The prose is elegant, and the subject matter selected and laid out judiciously for the purpose of maximum comparison. The author demonstrates, convincingly that if Eastern Medicine seems strange (and it always did) to Western eyes, Western Medicine is no less so in its peculiar assumptions about the body. All fine and good, BUT... The reason I give it four stars is that there is a lacuna in the logic of comparison here. The design of the study intended to do a one-on-one comparison necessarily restricts the theme drastically. What is seriously lacking is a treatment of the influence on the development of Chinese medicine of Taoist yoga and other esoteric techniques concerning the body, techniques well articulated during the Former Han Dynasty (ca. 200 BCE). The Helenic Civilization, and the West in general, is distinguished from the East by virtue of its lack of systematic techniques of mind-body control, the likes of which may be found in yoga and the various martial arts of the Chinese variety. It seems reasonable to assume that a martial arts technique has to be grounded in a particular, but thorough understanding of the body. And indeed, much of Chinese martial arts and yoga techniques, and medicine are based on experience of things not within the ken of Western modes of perception -- The notion of the ethereal body and various modes of consciousness,for example. But, alas, so much of what is within Chinese medicine and experience remains unmeasured and perhaps unmeasurable by modern Western medical episteme. There are some genuine efforts today in other sectors to bring scientific measurement within the scope of realities as espoused by Buddhist psychology. But real substantial dialogue is still way off, I think, insofar as what counts for episteme in the East is routed through an empirical &quot;meditational&quot; experience of the mind.  The author, in attempting to maintain a certain clarity of scholarly prose and presentation appears to have deliberately skipped over much of what would really make the topic interesting. One only hopes that either the author himself or others will bring out the entree soon now that the hors d'oeuvres have been served. But, there are limits to how much one can compare the two traditions using material evidence alone.	2001-05-07

I have no business there and I have no intercourse with the Chinese outside of personal relations. I picked this book up to read on the plane. But, man!  This is a very good book! Mr. Schneiter seems to have become something of a  Chinese himself during the course of 30 some years in the Far East. Clearly  written, with fast wit: Universally applicable advice on how to get along  with the Chinese, but not only the Chinese. I would think all people who  exchange one thing for another while trying to leverage the situation to  one's benefit could all be &quot;Chinese&quot;. That is, what the author  has to say, would apply just as well in Washington DC, or in Moscow, or in  New York. BE SMOOTH and CIVILIZED. By that he means, observe, observe, and  observe the flow of things before you take calculated action. AND, always  leave room for graceful improvisation. The author warns that it is always  practice which will get you the art of looking gracefully impromptu. The  author himself gives many examples of how he used his own advice to undo  many a tight situation he found himself in. I suppose only those who have  to do business with the Chinese will continue to pick this one up in Hong  Kong. But this book really deserves to be read by more people. A real  pleasure. I couldn't put it down.	2000-07-17

As such, it covers the entire ten decades of the 20th century, with a heavy emphasis on the British stuff --  Cecil Beaton's very &quot;gay&quot; sensibilities for the theatre and  later, of course, Peter Greenaway's Caravaggioesque obsessions in film.  Some very elegant and justifiably famous photographs are reproduced here,  including those shot for Dior and Co. Also valuable are some rare  photo-stills taken from cinema. But, on the whole, the book relies on the  idea that the &quot;Baroque&quot; is a state of mind, therefore anything  flamboyant goes. The book does well showcase the fundamental difference  between the works done during the high Baroque period and the 20th century  obsession for the bizzare. While the former almost always bore the virility  of taking delight in excess, the latter appears to be decidedly  Narcissistic, regurgitative and effete. The book shows to what extent the  European sensibility has become &quot;Chinese&quot; in modern times with  its incessant wistful harking back to a fixed style of pre-conceived form  of elegance and behavior.	2000-04-15
