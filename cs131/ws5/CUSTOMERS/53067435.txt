It is essentially a plea, supported by a historical outline, that Americans realize a couple of essential facts: That we are in a civilizational war with Islam -- and not \\"a few angry fanatics\\" -- and that our idealistic impulses, like trying to turn Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, etc., into democracies, only deepen the dangers we face. Whether you buy all, or any, of this, it is important that it be said, and Merry says it in a concise, interesting, and forceful manner. Idealists in foreign policy from Wilson to G.W. Bush have led us into peril, Merry argues, and it is time for some old-fashioned realpolitik, balance-of-power diplomacy. Essential reading for the thinking segment of America that neither hates Bush nor loves him blindly.	2005-09-13

After all, we all make choices and buy things daily, nearly always handicapped by incomplete information. Thanks to Levitt and his writing partner, layers of cant and superstition are stripped away from some very important questions (why do children succeed in school?) and some merely fascinating ones (why do sumo wrestlers cheat?). Levitt is the economist for the intelligent, interested nonspecialist -- in short, a much needed antidote to the ideology-based spewing or needlessly obscure academic irrevelancy that passes for thought these days. Economics are fun again, like when you set up that lemonade stand.	2005-05-08

The question behind NEVER LET ME GO -- What is it that makes us human? -- is one that both science fiction and literature are capable of tackling, or fumbling. The problem here is that approaching the question from the viewpoint of Kathy H. (the narrator) and her ilk is just too easy. So you have a novel which is not particularly ambitious, or a science fiction story which is not particularly novel. It has been years, but I recall that Karel Capek's WAR WITH THE NEWTS was a much more effective use of this theme. That said, NEVER LET ME GO is creepy and compelling enough to provide a pleasant diversion.	2005-04-29

The best example of McEwan's defect of scattering philosophical non sequiturs everywhere occurs on page 68 of the US edition, where the main character, Henry Perowne, a neurosurgeon, returns to his kitchen to find that the things that had been left on the countertops earlier are still there; \\"it's still faintly surprising, this rigid fidelity of objects.\\" There follows an ode to a tea kettle. If you can get through these brain egestions, which read like a genre writer trying too hard to write literature, you will find a fine book with superb set-pieces like a squash game, a minor car accident, and others which will be left unrevealed so as not to spoil the reader's discovery. (Why reviewers insist on ruining things by revealing plot points -- I knew what was going to happen around page 200 before I picked up the book -- is beyond me.)  Henry Perowne's adventures on a Saturday in February 2003 are executed with minimum dialogue and maximum insight.	2005-04-11

I was interested in Frankfurt's analysis of the difference between liars and BS artists, and his argument that lies are less of an affront to the truth than BS is. This last point seems counterintuitive, and might be contradicted by his earlier observation about how people will shrug off BS but sustain a real hurt because of a lie. But there is plenty of fodder for thought and further exploration, and Frankfurt is to be commended for his crystalline, intelligent style and for tackling a subject that seems to have been ignored, despite the fact that we are nearly drowning in it.	2005-03-31

I would like to unpack another review, which contends that Linn Ullmann has \\"an exclusive commitment to exposing life's banality\\" and a \\"condescending tone\\" that locks the reader out of the story. Taking the word at face value, of course life is banal -- what else can it be? We all have in common that we will die; there is nothing original there. Yet Ullmann emphatically finds meaning in life, in simple things like the dark strands of hair of Sletten's second wife, or her dutiful tending to a boil on his face. The human connections are true and moving, and we are only \\"locked out\\" of this story if we are expecting to be covered in sentimental goop and \\"feelings\\" a la the Oprah show; thankfully, Ullmann does not oblige. A condescending tone? Ullmann is clear-eyed, grown-up, and has no illusions about human virtuousness. If that's condescending, then Joseph Conrad was condescending. GRACE is a beautiful little book.	2005-01-25

THE FULL CLEVELAND, by contrast, is underwrought, and on balance that is to its credit. Terry Reed has a sly sense of humor, a good ear for dialogue, and a prose style that quietly asserts its originality. The coming-of-age story is a tired old thing, though, and there's not much new here. Most characters don't achieve a third dimension. Still, this is a well-written novel by an author worth watching.	2005-01-15

It is particularly refreshing to find in the sections that analyze the books individually no descent into the obscurantism that pervades so much \\"professional\\" literary criticism. Parini's account is, however, marred, as a previous reviewer pointed out, by an unaccountable number of typographical and other mistakes that are no less maddening for their slightness. For example, \\"Jefferson County\\" appears several times when Lafayette is intended; there is the birthdate error; and about 20 other typographical glitches. These serve to break the spell that would otherwise propel most readers, I think, to finish this fine book in a gulp.	2005-01-06

Think of the difference, for example, between realism and photorealism in painting. Tom Wolfe is a photorealist, an excellent one, and I AM CHARLOTTE SIMMONS is worthwhile not least for the dozens of passages that will literally startle the reader with their microscopic excavation of detail, mannerism, or speech. Then too, there is an element in this novel that people seem to miss, or underrate: Wolfe can be hilariously funny. Some of the set pieces are not merely funny but are carefully constructed to build with an impressive momentum. As for Charlotte Simmons, her personality and story are painted about as sensitively as a photorealist can do it, particularly the section where she is overcome by depression. But in the end this novel is, like Zola, too real. Balzac was just as consumed by issues of class and status as Wolfe is, and he painted Paris with as sharp an eye as Wolfe does Dupont University. But strange things happen in Balzac; he was not rewriting newspaper articles. For all Wolfe's immense talent with words, nothing that happens in I AM CHARLOTTE SIMMONS surprises.	2005-01-04

Reynolds' WALT WHITMAN armed with almost total ignorance of the poet, I was satisfied in finishing that I had gained a good grounding in Whitman's life, times, and work. The first chapter, a brief biography, lays the foundation for those that follow on Whitman's art and his response to, among other things, war, sex, and science. Annoyingly there are four typographical errors within its 138 pages of text, but WALT WHITMAN nevertheless succeeds marvelously in providing scholarly content to the generalist in a crisp, well-organized style.	2004-12-24

The artist, the propagandist, grappling with a new medium can be a rich vein to explore in the right hands, as here.

There is no sense of showing off. And he has a great ear and comic sense. Most importantly, the stories will catch you at the end; they don't just fizzle out into smug nilhilism.

So Orhan Pamuk has done a tremendous service to Western readers by seriously, though fictionally, examining the secular/religious/military conflicts of modern Turkey. He has wrapped this astute political novel inside a love story that is often touching, then thrown in some thriller effects, and magic, heavy symbolism and poetry to boot. In short, it is too much of a mishmash. And the translation is rather clunky. But SNOW, for its seriousness and insight, demands to be  widely read.	2004-12-02

The feel of the place -- its  mountains, animals, flowers, foods -- is captured with a keen eye (and ear, and nose). Secondly, the structure, going back and forth in time and making connections along the way, is irresistible. Where she has not succeeded so well is in creating characters that achieve verisimilitude. The sometimes stilted dialogue doesn't help. And the story itself, for all its exoticism, doesn't rise much beyond the mundane. Still, THE ZIGZAG WAY is a quick, entertaining read worthly of a recommendation, though not an emphatic one.	2004-11-15

John Ames is a tedious old pastor who, at the opening of this epistle, declares that he has a bum ticker and is not long for the world. The time is 1950s Iowa. He is writing to his six-year-old son. And writing. And writing some more. Let's be clear: It's not the rural setting that makes GILEAD dreadful (Yoknapatawpha has more life in it than Manhattan), or the fact that religion is covered (Dreiser's THE BULWARK, for example, is wonderful), it's that the main character is drained white of everything but earnestness and holiness and a rather superior attitude about his own intellect. Here he is, the self-described \\"good son,\\" speaking: \\"I am one of those righteous for whom the rejoicing in heaven will be relatively restrained.\\" Whew! This guy makes a 13th century scholastic monk look like a party animal. Hold on to your hats, there are 247 pages of this as Ames works over issues of faith, and grace, and the sacraments, and predestination, and envy, amid telling (now and then) tales of his family history which are moderately interesting, despite being peopled by people like him. (His grandfather should have written his life story, not this scold.) Ames likes to walk around in the middle of the night or watch his son blow a bubble (then rhapsodize about it). Now of course he is a pastor, so that's natural -- it's not his fault that he's a bore and an insufferable prig. That's how some pastors are. And the author has created a person who lives, who emerges off the page, so the question then becomes: For whose benefit? Not the reader's. GILEAD is tedious, humorless, lifeless, so damn serious. And not even sad, or shocking, or revelatory. Just droning.	2004-11-07

It is a strange book filled with fascinating Vegas characters -- the comic, the bail bondsman, the hooker -- and their back stories, played out against the author's life story and his quest for, what exactly? Well, he lives a disconnected life, and finds meaning in the stories of others, but doesn't want to get too close because that would require an investment in time and care he isn't willing to make. He is a reporter. He is also a brilliant prose stylist, very funny, sharp, with keen observational and descriptive skills. A terrific book.	2004-01-26

Although more conventional  stylistically than Dos Passos's revolutionary montage, Angel Pavement shares with that work a rich and engaging realism. Read it, and you will *be* in 1930s London, following the lives of a group of employees of a veneer and furniture inlay business. The cast of characters is ordinary, yet fascinating; their work and what happens to them isn't all that unusual, either, yet you *will* care. Priestley shows myriad skills here: His ear for dialogue, including dialects, is impeccable; his descriptive powers, making use not only of sights but sounds and smells to create a scene, are keen; and he writes with an effortless and pleasing style. In short, this is a superb novel, unjustly forgotten and well worth your time.	2004-01-01

Novels are fiction, yes, but an effective novel involves the reader to such an extent that he believes what he is reading actually happened. That never happens in GENESIS because the characters are bathed in artificiality -- they resemble robots, in fact -- and the story is scarcely worth describing. The setting, a phony city, comes off as phony (although for some reason I kept thinking of Ljubljana -- not the real city, just a phony city written to sound like Ljubljana). I have dipped into contemporary literary fiction from time to time -- and I heard Crace was a rare nonironical nonpostmodernist nonsneerer -- but I have almost always been deeply disappointed. This book is no exception. Back to J.B. Priestley, P.H. Newby, Waugh and Greene. I will say that Crace has a stylistic flair: His sentences produce a pleasing, though somewhat staccato, effect, and he has a talent for the odd construction or word choice. But under no circumstances would I give this book to a friend.	2003-12-24

I<br />enjoyed the early books in the series but lost track of Burke some time after Dixie City Jam.<br />In rejoining the series with this book, several facts became strikingly clear. First, Burke<br />remains a skilled atmospheric writer. The bloodred skies, the gum trees and schooling fish,<br />the blowing rain and leaves, the physical appearance of the characters -- Burke can certainly<br />paint a scene. Second, Dave remains as humorless and grim and earnest and possessed by<br />&quot;&quot;demons'' as ever, and frankly I'm tired of it. In 341 pages, I had one involuntary laugh.<br />(And that was when the sheriff made light of Dave's weirdness.) Didn't Marlowe and Lew Archer<br />have a similarly admirable (if unconventional) moral code, without having to beat everyone<br />over the head with it? No one is asking Dave to be a comic, but a lead character must be<br />appealing, and Dave isn't. Third, Burke still writes excellent, snappy, idiomatic dialogue.<br />It's great fun to read characters talking about about &quot;&quot;flushing'' someone's &quot;&quot;grits'' and<br />other colorful euphemisms for killing. Beyond these general observations, some specifics.<br />Other reviewers have pointed out that the Alafair infatuation is wholly unrealistic; I agree.<br />(I am also tired of Dave calling her &quot;&quot;Alf'' despite her wish going back several books that he<br />use her full name.) Cletus is on tilt, and that's fine; he's one of the main attractions of<br />the series. And as with others in the series, it doesn't pay to try to diagram all the plot<br />twists, or holes, in Purple Cane Road. Just read and enjoy. Burke has created Robicheaux and<br />he has to live with him; I don't. So although this was a fairly satisfying read, the<br />annoyances detailed here will keep me from running out to buy the next in the series.	2003-08-12

But to begin with a positive, the opening account of how a fictional Stephen Glass is caught fabricating stories at the Washington Weekly is compelling, suspenseful and comical. There is also a chuckle here and there afterward.<br />  But there is much, much more wrong with this novel.<br />  First, its action rings horribly false. Many of set-piece situations (with women's underwear, in a plane to Chicago, with a woman dressed in purple, at  a strip club, during a brief affair, at an animal hospital, among others) are so contrived and unrealistic that it is impossible to be unaware for more than a minute at a stretch during the entire 339 pages that you are reading a novel. Whether any or all of these incidents actually or even partially occurred is of course irrelevant. As written, they are unbelievable even as fiction. A novel is not 'true,' of course, but a good one casts a spell which causes the reader to believe he is experiencing reality, albeit an alternative one. Mario Vargas Llosa has written beautifully and instructionally on this in Letters to a Young Novelist and A Writer's Reality. I would suggest that Glass read them, but with a reported six-figure advance for this monstrosity, why would he?<br />  Another way a novel becomes 'real' is with characterizations and descriptions. Glass has little time for this. The characters, including the protagonist, are pita-flat. I couldn't describe the Glass in this book; he simply never emerges from the page into the imagination. Although Sylvia, a love interest, is almost recognizable as a human being (there is a nice descriptive detail about her earlobes), most of the other characters are little more than ciphers. In this, the writer has failed again: The characters in their falsity nag at the reader, reminding him that he is reading a novel  exactly the wrong effect.<br />  Descriptions of place, which in literature inject a reader into a scene and add authenticity, are likewise absent or bare bones.<br />  But what is not absent is Glass's self-absorption and apologizing. It overflows. 'I am sorry.' 'I am so sorry.' 'I am so very sorry.' 'You don't know how sorry I am.' Why do I keep reading this? you ask yourself. Glass invented the Washington Weekly stories because he wanted to be loved. The end. This is a novel? I thought novels were supposed to tackle complex issues, or at least entertain. This does neither. This is the Dr. Phil show.<br />  The book's tin-eared dialogue is yet another mark of failure. To take just one example, I refer readers to the quote by the fictional Glass on page 327 that begins, 'Can a lizard ...' I challenge anyone to read that paragraph and say it comes across as honest, or even sensible, dialogue. It reeks...<br />  And that brings me to my theory. After the real Glass was caught making up stories at the New Republic, he may have thought, 'Since I'm so good at this, I'll write fiction!' Here's the problem: Fiction needs truth, too. Glass's experience at the New Republic may have taught him that liars shouldn't write nonfiction. But what The Fabulist teaches us...ticity, are likewise absent or bare bones.<br />   But what is not absent is Glass's self-absorption and apologizing. It overflows. 'I am sorry.' 'I am so sorry.'

But what you get out of it, what is more lasting than the stories of a pack of low-down people clawing and cheating and killing their way across Yoknapatawpha County -- which are devastating, and funny, and weird enough in themselves to earn this novel the highest praise -- is the sensation of immersion into William Faulkner's fictional reality. It is a universe in which the characters do things that people do, but as you are reading you get the feeling you might be dreaming. Something is just off, and that strangeness serves as a giant light beam on the human soul. No one has concocted a stage and players like this, with such deep insight, and beautiful poetic prose, and humor, since Shakespeare maybe. Read The Hamlet slowly, read sentences twice sometimes, don't hurry, and you will be utterly, irreversibly hooked.	2002-09-21

Knowing this postscript before I picked up the book made  the murders of all those investigators, police and journalists who dared to  oppose Cosa Nostra all the more poignant. But this is much more than a  mafia book. There is art, food, politics, all covered with an insightful  and entertaining style. I was at first put off by the technique of  italicizing quotations and words of emphasis, thinking it was overdone, but  I found myself admiring the device about a third of the way through, and I  believe that it is quite effective. This book has earned a place beside  &quot;The Leopard&quot; and Barzini's &quot;The Italians&quot; in my  library.

It is a shame that someone with such a practical, intelligent and courageous plan for  governing Peru was not elected. Vargas Llosa has serious doubts that Peru  will ever become a &quot;serious&quot; nation, and after reading A Fish in  the Water it's difficult to disagree. The insights into racism in Peru are  fascinating, and the story of his young life is entertaining and at times  moving, especially as it concerns his abusive father. This work is not at  all self-serving, and yet the reader cannot help but admire (and like)  Vargas Llosa. My only quibble is that some of the passages of his college  days are overlong with lists of friends and acquaintances, some of whom are  not remarkable and could have easily been left out. But Vargas Llosa, as  usual, has produced a work of rigor and grace.	1998-11-24

The lovable but sour Barney Panofsky is brilliantly drawn in the first person, and many of the scenes (the college sit-in protest, to name just one) are downright hilarious. It is also heartbreakingly sad. Still, it seems like every Richler novel has the same cast: the &quot;good&quot; wife, the mysterious missing character, the drunk. And I felt cheated by a death in Barney's Version because it was a close match with a situation in A Choice of Enemies, one of his early novels. But Richler fans, and I am one, should enjoy it.	1998-01-09
