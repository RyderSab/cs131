Ever notice how some people seem to always get their way, even though they're (arguably)&quot;wrong&quot;. This book will teach you how! This is not a Machiacelliv book, but it will certainly teach you how to relate with  other people in a way that makes them empathize with your cause and agree  with you. Once you've learned this, you can use the knowledge to win  trials, close a business deal, get a promotion, bargain, or simply relate  to the world in general in a way that will make everyone love you!<br />From  posture to body language, argumentation, organization of thought, etc.,  this book really works! Did you know, for example, that people believe body  language over your actual words because they think that is more natural? So  learn to control your body language, learn the &quot;social  stereotypes&quot; and you're off to manipulate everyone into agreeing with  you!<br />Also check &quot;What would Machiavelli Do?&quot; By Stanley Bing,  &quot;The 48 Laws of Power&quot; by R.

Well, if you're not in control, then someone else is, and then your life is being controlled by someone else.

This does not mean being  agressive, people will willingly give into your leadership because you will  have learned how to manipulate them, and they'll like you even more!  (amazingly). Learn not to underestimate others. Learn to make others  underestimate you sometimes (play a bit dumb. Learn every trick in the book  of  Power (and be able to deduct any one that may not be included in this  book once you assimilate the philosophy behind it). Of course, you can  believe everyone is nice and that power is only for sick people. Or, you  could read this book, use it, and get control of your world! (Why don't you  read it, try it, and then decide)<br />I also recommend &quot;Winning: Using  Lawyers' Courtroom techniques to get Your Way in Everyday Situations&quot;  by Noelle C.

As a lawyer specializing in Amparo and Criminal Law, I can say that this is a trully excellent book. Dr. Baker's analysis of the Mexican amparo system is excellent, and it is a good begining for comparing Mexican  judicial review to that of the United States.<br />Because the book was  written in 1971, some amendments have been made to the amparo law since  then, so you will have to study about these changes elsewhere. Nonetheless,  as the essence of the institution has not changed, Dr. Baker's book is  still an excellent analysis of the Mexican Amparo system.
