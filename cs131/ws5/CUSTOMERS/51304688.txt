I thought I was the only one who noticed the trends Levy writes about, but apparently not.  Despite the naysayers who don't seem to understand the tenets and history of feminism, even though Levy carefully lays them out, and the concepts of \\"raunch culture\\", the author has struck a big nerve.  \\"Female Chauvinist Pigs\\" is a polemical sister to \\"The Feminine Mystique\\" and \\"Backlash\\".<br /><br />Levy is not saying sexuality is bad, and she goes out of her way to prove her point.  What Levy is concerned about is this mechanical, forced sexuality that suddenly seems ubiquitous that really isn't very sexy or empowering.  One interesting point Levy makes is how this raunch culture seems to be flourishing under the harsh political climate of the Religious Right.  It is a measure of the hypocrisy on all levels of American Life that while the zealots are foaming at the mouth to stop gay marriage, an entirely different problem is emerging and nobody has said one thing about it.  Perhaps the lesson is raunch will be allowed to exist as long as it is heterosexual.  Remember, all those girls kissing girls are doing it for the guys sake.<br /><br />Whether you agree with Levy or not, this is a book that should be read, debated and distributed.	2005-10-04

It moves quickly and most surprisingly, the second person narration is in no way an obstacle; the novel reads smooth and easy.  Perhaps the book's only true flaw is a dip into sentimentality and Hollywood romance toward the end of the book, but otherwise, it's a biting look at everything from the less than glamorous world of fact-checking at a prestigious magazine (a thinly veiled New Yorker), the club scene and feeling lost in your 20s.  If you ever wonder what happened to Holden Caulfield, this book is one of the many directions his life could have taken after \\"Catcher in the Rye\\".<br /><br />In 2005, the book functions not only as a novel but a time capsule of the time when people could afford studio apartments downtown.  The World Trade Center still stands, the corner drugstores has not yet been converted into Starbucks but life is not any simpler.  But over twenty years later, through it all, \\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" endures.	2005-08-02

To say that McEwan's book is reminiscent of great authors as varied as Austen, Forster and Hemingway is not giving McEwan his own credit, although I admit I compared his writing style and storytelling to those same authors as I read the novel.  From the idyllic English countryside scenes in the beginning to the graphic war horrors of later on, McEwan tells a story about an act and its consequences that carry over time.  The final act, set in contemporary times, carries a cruel twist but nonetheless one that makes sense.<br /><br />Simply put, \\"Atonement\\" is one of the best books I've read this year.  That may sound a premature statement as the year isn't even half-over, but I doubt I'll find another book quite as complex and engrossing as this one before December -- not that I'll stop trying.	2005-05-05

But his break was getting the book published to positive (judging by the rhapsodic Amazon reviews and cover blurbs) acclaim, so it's not really my job to be a cheerleader if I'm not feeling it.<br /><br />\\"How I Paid for College\\" should have been edited more fiercely and whittled down to half its size.  I put this book down on more than one occasion, debating whether to pick it back up due to a dawdling beginning. Instead of being able to jump right into the book, you wade through chapter after verbose chapter until the central conflict finally appears deep within the first quarter of the novel.<br /><br />My biggest problem with the book was how many cliches and formulaic dialogue Acito trots out.  Yes, there actually is a scene when the characters try and prevent an authority figure from using the bathroom because, get this ... they're HIDING SOMEBODY IN THERE!!!  Remember how this device was used quite a lot on 70's fare like \\"Three's Company\\"?  Remember when it wasn't all that funny then either?  And the less said about the really tiresome (sitcomish again) device of hijinks in priest and nun garb, the better.  Add a distasteful blackmail tactic that really stretches the limits of taste (Acito seems to find this scenario of photographing people naked when they're out cold so funny that he uses it twice), and you're just stuck with a YA novel in disguise with a lot of tiresome (and gratuitous) sex.<br /><br />Characters are introduced, and then sidelined, then reemerge and then will curiously vanish altogether.  While it's good that Acito doesn't overdo it with the cultural references, it can be argued that the 80s setting is therefore superfluous: the book could have easily been set in contemporary times.  And despite the \\"edginess\\" of sexual ambiguity this book promises, it's a big tease and most of the sex is just status quo.	2005-04-26

Had I paid more attention, I'd have had an even better sense of place of that little corner of the world Frazier depcits in \\"Cold Mountain\\" -- which is not to say that Frazier doesn't do a superb job to begin with.  \\"Cold Mountain\\" is one of the best novels I have read in a few years, and one that I will go back and reread one day.<br /><br />Frazier's prose is quiet and mournful; we don't witness the Civil War so much as the effects of it:  a world turned upside down where violence has become part of the natural order.  Many comparisons are made between \\"Mountain\\" and Homer's Odyssey, but I think saying \\"based upon\\" would be stretching things.  The journey of a man home to his beloved is a timeless theme;  at most, I would say \\"Mountain\\" is inspired by \\"The Odyssey.\\"  For a more concrete worked patterned after Homer, look for the Coen Brother's film, \\"O Brother Where Art Thou?\\"<br /><br />Frazier clearly has respect for all of his characters, and writes them so well that when the book ends, you miss them. I especially loved Ruby and Ada, taking the matters of the Black Cove farm into their own hands.  A small coda at the end of the book does answer some questions, but I was greedy and wanted to know even more.  Be prepared to pick the book up and not surrender it until you've finished ... it's THAT good.	2005-04-01

Based upon the true story of Ann and Bobby Woodward, the novel is involving  but the characters never breathe; instead they have been recruited from central casting.  We have the WASPy, old money family, the showgirl, the ineffectual, weak son plus a chorus of devoted Irish maids and homosexual designers and novelists. Dunne has done the remarkable: taken a true story and whittled it down to cliches. The florid prose doesn't help either, but I am willing to give Dunne the doubt as we are reminded at times that the story is being told (or concocted) by a Capote-esque novelist with a grudge.<br /><br />Time hasn't been kind to the novel.  Definitely a beach read, but not much more.	2005-01-07

I am surprised she didn't include a photo section just to take up more space, but her horsey face on the cover was enough; nobody wants to see candid photos of Ann at the beach -- she would look like a sun bleached skeleton picked clean by buzzards.<br /><br />Unfortunately, if one were to call this \\"Ann Coulter's Greatest Hits\\" they'd be wrong. Coulter's writings are lacking in greatness; instead, Ann thrives on the almighty sound-bite, much like her equally insane opposite, Camille Paglia, did in the early 1990s.  Much of what Coulter says is distortion that amounts to little more than name calling.<br /><br />This is obviously a cheap excuse for Ann to wring what final bucks she can out of a gullible public.  Poorly put together and presented, this book is the epitome of the unchecked (and unstable) ego.	2004-10-06

A rather lazy, slap-dash compendium	I was a huge fan of this comic when I was younger and, despite the fact that it had been cancelled in 1981, was able to find a good amount of the issues in backbins at comics stores (this was before somebody decided that these were very collectible).<br /><br />I was glad to see that DC had released this paperback, but disappointed by the quality. True, the art by Ramona Fradon and Bob Smith looks great and has that wonderful cartoon quality, and it's always fun to see Wendy and Marvin but what the heck? There is no real introduction (save some explanation on the back) to this book and explaining the history of the SuperFriends cartoon and book.  Plus, the reader is cheated.<br /><br />The first two issues of the book were a two-parter and the editors of this collection cut off the last two panels of the first issue and promptly end the story abruptly.  Would it really have killed the powers that be to include the second issue which concludes the tale? This is very sloppy and anybody can see that the story is never resolved.<br /><br />Thankfully, we do get the entire three-part story where Wendy and Marvin are replaced by the Wonder Twins (something never explained on the series) and some other decent stories.<br /><br />Enjoy this book, but unfortunately you'll have to look elsewhere for the conclusion to the first story.	2004-07-23

Unfortunately, Tillotson spends too much time putting her misguided opinions into the text. Her revisionist history of the housewife is unnecessary and annoying.<br />Tillotson writes as if the women's movement did a bad thing by making housework and housewifery look unrewarding.  Let's get one thing straight: feminism didn't do that.  Feminism gave women their voices to problems that ALREADY existed. Had there not been a problem, there wouldn't have been so many women willing to make something new of themselves besides just being a stay at home wife. Feminism only wanted women to be able to make the choice to stay at home or not. (This excludes the radical feminists who are a minority, but whose inflammatory comments were focused on more intently by the media than the more mainstream feminists.)<br />The early issues of Ms. magazine, which people seem to think vilified housewives, are actually a housewife's biggest booster. It's somewhat alarming that Tillotson's revisionist history makes the era of the feminine mystique one that should be missed.  It wasn't the idea of being a housewife, it was the images and ads like the one in this book that made women feel inadequate unless they were as happy and neat as in these beaming ads.<br />Tillotson, that fine social critic, seems to see a resurgence of longing for that \\"simpler time\\" in arguments that have been disproved since Faludi's Backlash:<br />\\"The trend once called cocooning was renamed \\"nesting\\" and continued to grow. So did, what some pundits called, \\"the domestic-bliss industry.\\" Old-style home cooking was once again in vogue, a guilty pleasure loaded with carbohydrates, fat, and salt.  The comforting accoutrements of the 1950s, such as Fiesta dinnerware and brightly colored aluminum tumblers, began appearing on store shelves once again.\\"<br />It should also be noted that Tillotson does not cite any sources for her examples. One would think the reappearance of Fiestware owes more to the kitsch angle than anybody equating it with a return of the housewife.<br />Read this book for the fun pictures and laugh at the naivete that true bliss comes from a dishwasher; ignore the text and you'll have a good time.f Fiestware owes more to the kitsch angle than anybody equating it with a return of the housewife.<br />Read this book for the fun pictures and laugh at the naivete that true bliss comes from a dishwasher; ignore the text and you'll have a good time.	2004-05-24

For the majority, I'd say their entry point to an author's canon usually is the well-received work, so it's fun to browse an author's &quot;backlog&quot; and experience their earliest achievements.  Having been a fan of Alice Walker for many years but only having read two novels (plus a great deal of short stories and non-fiction), I figured it was time to give her first published novel, &quot;The Third Life of Grange Copeland,&quot; a try.<br />Had this been written by anybody but Alice Walker, I'd say this was one of the most impressive debut novels I've read.  Since it *is* written by Walker, I should have known to not be surprised by the eloquence, the poetry and the grittiness of this book. Alice Walker is a storyteller with gifts bordering on the supernatural; if the Southern U.S. landscape could talk, it would sound a lot like Alice Walker. This is the story, told in razor sharp prose, of a man and the effect his actions have on his family over a period of many years.  It's not an easy novel to read as there are hard truths in the story of Grange and Brownfield but there are lessons that will stay with the reader. This is also an interesting study on the actions of an individual, and who is to blame; society or the man/woman? There are no such easy answers in this book and I found myself wavering between sympathy and outright hatred for some of the characters, but it's the mark of a great read when I can feel so much for a story.	2004-04-23

The new book about stereotypes of women is fun and informative.  The section on Tokyo Rose is enlightening and rather sad, and kudos to them for exposing some of the myths of the &quot;sainted&quot; Mother Theresa. These things need to be said and recorded.<br />But in the book they also make the statement that about 8 million women were put to death from the Europe witch hunts.  HUH??? Who is their fact checker? Check population statistics of Europe from that time and you'll see that with 8 million  gone in 200 years would have led to a PRECIPITOUS decline in population - a decline that did not happen.<br />From on source on witchcraft comes this:<br />&quot;Church persecution of witches occurred in England,<br />France, Germany, Italy, Scotland, and Spain. In<br />1431, Joan of Arc, the French national heroine, was<br />condemned to death as a witch by the English and<br />was burned at the stake. From 1484 to 1782,<br />according to some historians, the Christian church<br />put to death about 300,000 women for practicing<br />witchcraft. Many of these women suffered such<br />terrible torture that they confessed to being<br />witches simply to avoid further torment. &quot;<br />300,000 is a huge amount but not nearly as large as 8 million. Guerilla Girls are about truth, and I'd hate to have their credibility questioned by those willing to poke holes in any argument you make.  The book has another error in that it says the Stonewall Riots were in 1968.  Actually, they were in 1969.<br />This said, the book is well-designed, but just be wary about accepting everything at face value as two errors already jump out. I hope that the Guerilla Girls will continue to spread truth and education but I also hope they do their research first.	2004-04-18
US	51304688	R2NSK44TJMKGGY	0671003771	182227653	The Same River Twice	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Mixed Feelings	Reading Walker's prose can be like talking with a live person face to face.  There is no aloof distance between Walker and the reader, one feels that she is addressing them personally; the drawback to this is that when she says something you may not agree with, you can feel a little hurt or even betrayed. The Color Purple is a story that so many people lay &quot;claim&quot; to, and is one of the most important books of the twentieth century. Readership of the novel has only grown since its initial publication in 1982, and it's no wonder that Walker feels such a bond to this story of hers.  The problem is that the rights were sold to make a movie version and Walker wasn't entirely pleased with the results.<br />While I am sure any writer would feel very ambivalent about a film version of their novel (as Ken Kesey did for &quot;Cuckoo's Nest&quot;), when one signs the film rights away, they should brace themselves for the disappointment. Walker takes us step-by-step through the disappointment but the final conclusion is a feeling of ingratitude. What is important to me is that because of the movie I became aware of the book and thus began my love for Alice Walker. As a teen I loved the movie, but being older now I do see many moments in the film as rather embarrassing. But again, had it not been for the film I would not have read the book.<br />But why did Walker choose to write this book?  Parts of it are very interesting, but much of the book is just a bunch of journal entries and news clippings. Walker does submit her entire screenplay that she proposed; Her screenplay is actually less streamlined than the script that made it to the screen and has too many moments involving the patterns in a quilt that stop the story dead in its tracks. For all the flaws of the screenplay that was adapted, (and there are many), it's a much less rambling script than Walkers.<br />Despite Walker's intentions, the book comes off as ungrateful. After all, she was able to make a nice home for herself.  But this book is interesting to see the author's point of view.  Had Purple been made in the 50's, it would have been damaged beyond repair and probably taken the point of view of one of the minor white characters ... if it would have been made at all. We've all seen movies that ruined a book, Walker is one of the only ones who has been voal about it.<br />But Walker should also take heart, at least she didn't write &quot;Beloved&quot; and watch that transition to the screen.me for herself.

Goat is a subjective work, and it's obvious that frat life is not the area Brad Land should have focused so much of his attention on while in school.  But then, Brad Land probably shouldn't have done a lot of things.<br />Some have criticized this book for the spare, faux hipster style. I didn't have a problem with that as its very apparent that Land is a true writer and I will chalk up the moments that seem a bit too flowery and overwritten to his youth. What I criticize is that we don't know enough about Land. After reading this book, my only thought was, \\"This kid's a nut.\\" I wish he could have maybe put his life into some bigger perspective.  Just learning that he was severely beaten and then obsessively tried to join a frat wasn't enough for me to figure out who Land is. We only know this kid from his present, no real background, no past and it makes it hard to picture him as a fully-rounded person. Doesn't he have any other thoughts in his head? Also, why he would willingly put himself through such torture as fraternity hazing after his experience being kidnapped and beaten just smacks of masochism. Of course, that seems to be the central question that never really gets answered. (...)<br />I think Land's talents would best be suited to other types of prose, and to that end, I look forward to seeing his talents producing good fiction in the future.	2004-03-23

There was often grumbling in certain circles that Gloria Steinem had so much attention paid to her because she was pretty. If that was the only factor, Steinem's popularity would have waned, not because she lost her looks (she never did) but because of the fickleness of the media and the \\"next pretty face.\\" Steinem is smart, brave, funny and a damn good writer. \\"Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions\\", her 1983 book of collected essays proves it in spades.<br />In early 1993, I had the privilege of seeing Gloria Steinem speak at Mount Holyoke College. I had to take the bus from UMASS to get there, and the place was packed.  They closed the doors at one point saying it was too full, but they ended up letting most people in.  When Ms. Steinem took the stage, she urged all those who were standing in the back to come up and join her onstage so that they could sit.  This is the kindness and warmth that Steinem raidates. Many people in the audience were clutching copies of her books for her to sign. As this was the era of \\"Revolution from Within,\\" that book was everywhere.  But I also saw many copies of \\"Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions\\" as well. By then the book was 10 years old, but I can understand why people held onto it. This is a great book of essays written over the years.  The book touches upon topics such as abortion rights, Jackie Onassis, Alice Walker, Steinem's college reunion, Steinem's own relationship with her mother and the famous expose of Steinem's undercover work at the Playboy Club in the early 60's. Having a journalism background, Steinem's prose is clear and concise. This is no rhetoric-filled theory-based polemic, but a balanced and fair look at the world from the perspective of an extraordinary woman.  Also included in this collection is the wonderfully wry, \\"If Men Could Menstruate.\\" The second edition of this book has some updated comments from Steinem that reflect on the essays more than a decade after the book was published.<br />For all those who condemn feminism yet really know nothing about it, read this book.

I enjoyed Huneven's sophomore effort, Jamesland, so much that I searched out this earlier novel; I advise all those who also enjoyed Jamesland to do the same.  Huneven's writing style is as fresh and clean as the California air above the Santa Bernita Valley, where the novel is set. This book has a cast of characters who are very real. Huneven has the gift to write about The Rest of Us: women who cannot afford the $1000 Manolo Blahnik shoes and have more pressing issues to attend to, and men who don't have washboard abs and SUVs.  The people in Huneven's world live in OUR world. Perhaps at times, all the coincidences and linked destinies can be a bit Dickensian, but with such a smooth, engrossing narrative it works.  And it works supremely well.<br />I am surprised that Huneven has been, up to this point, rather overlooked.  I'd never heard of her before and now I only want to see more. It's a shame when so many lesser works and authors are getting attention and being chosen for one of the myriad book clubs on television.<br />This is the Huneven challenge: go to the library and read one of her books.  Or buy it at the bookstore; I'm pretty sure you'll be glad you did.	2004-03-21

Both the history of the character of Jean Grey and the writer/artists conflicts with the then editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics isn't found anywhere in this book (and believe me, it adds a lot to the tale) but the co-plotters Chris Claremont and John Byrne (assisted by Terry Austin on inks and a huge acknowledgement to the overlooked Tom Orzechowski and his lettering) have written such an engaging tale that you can jump in anywhere and enjoy the story. The best thing is that they were not consciously setting out to write a &quot;saga&quot; and therefore, they weren't pressured to create something that would sell in the trade paperbacks twenty years on.  It's just far and away a story with a punch: a gut wrenching finale and some of the most beautiful artwork of the era.<br />This latest edition of the trade spruces up the artwork (no more dot matrix colors) and includes (for the first time) the much needed cover gallery, which was absent from previous printings. The art and story have hold up so well that almost a quarter of a century later it still stands as one of the best comic stories of all time.	2004-03-17
US	51304688	R1UOKJ4LDE7N46	0375413820	497278203	Jamesland	Books	4	4	4	N	Y	Only Connect	As a Henry James fan, it is interesting to see the effect that his brother, William James, has had upon the world. James' ghost (literally and figuratively) is present throughout this entire novel.  This is a very enjoyable read by Huneven and cements her talent on handling multiple storylines and distinctive characters as she does in her first novel, &quot;Round Rock.&quot;<br />The characters have all suffered very real traumas, and are trying to find their way in the world. There are times when you feel that perhaps things are going along a little too pat and Huneven then throws you a curve. Some characters and their purpose for being in the novel seem little more than plot devices but I can handle that because the rest of the book is so enjoyable.  I found myself not only enjoying the characters, but identifying with them.  The only main character I found a bit much at times was Helen, who at times seemed a bit too intrusive and pushy.  Plus, while her sermons are supposedly inspiring, one can see how they may have riled her congregation of staid worshippers. I do like the expose of the hypocirsy among the members of the church Helen presides over.  Imagine being a secular church dedicated to the innate good of people, but never doing good works.<br />Jamesland is a great, unique read. This is definitely a book worth holding onto.	2004-03-16

I am glad that there are more and more books like this available that don't focus on sex as much as they do self-awareness and coming to power. The characters are all interesting, though a few are a bit underdeveloped.  I think terese and Ike got short shifted, and I would have liked to know more about them and what they were thinking.  My only real problem with the story is that at the end of the book, the narrator takes too high of a road. I found it inconsistent that a character who was just coming out and had all the normal anxieties and hormones of a young guy would make such adult decisions about his relationship, etc.  It does not ring true, and seems to have been in there to give him some noble bearing. It's a bit unnecessary as there was no real reason for the choice he makes. I think it was a poor one.  This was a good reading experience and it took me back to high school and made me think, \\"If ..\\"  This book is an enoyable read for people of all stripes.	2004-03-16
US	51304688	RSE3GQSWTIIJ3	0767915054	358484575	A Girl Named Zippy	Books	2	10	22	N	N	Lukewarm	With such a title and the promise of fun times from the jacket copy, you'd think you'd be in for a laugh-o-rama.  Unfortunately, this book falls very short on promise and seems to only have been carried aloft by its hype.<br />I am amazed at the number of memoirs that have been coming out in the past year; memoirs written by people who have previously been strangers to us. They reveal in-depth stories of their life, but in the end, I wonder why they chose to share.  What about their life was so fascinating that they got a book contract? The answer still eludes me.<br />Kimmel's tries so hard to be  entertaining that truth is sacrificed. The tales she tells are as elastic as sans-a-belt pants. The cute little details of how overly precocious she was are to add pepper to a bland Midwestern meal. If this is all she really has to share with us, what is to stop anybody else from being able to write a book about our own unremarkable families.<br />The narrative as a whole jumps around and never gives any feeling of cohesiveness or linear structure.  This is fine - were this Faulkner or Joyce. Some of the more intriguing characters, such as Kimmel's inwardly angry brother, are never developed and remain enigmas. But the main focus of this book is Kimmel's &quot;wasn't I just the most precocious thing!&quot; younger self. It doesn't really work.<br />One thing that seesm to rankle many people who have reviewed this book is the treatment of animals. Give me a break.  Kimmel grew up in a rather rural area, and animals are not given the bourgeois status we now assign to them.  What was her friend supposed to do with the dead pig? Stuff and mount it? Really, the description of the animals in this book is matter of fact and Kimmel's reactions to them as a country girl seemed to be one of the most authentic things about the book.	2004-03-16

His books are not big tasks to be undertaken, but are enjoyable, easy reads (and perfect for the subways.)  This isn't to say his reads are light; Maugham deals with the darker aspects of human nature and hypocrisy. Of Human Bondage is a great work. Those who think they know the story from watching the movie may be surprised that it is about a bit more than just the story of therelationship with the slatternly waitress. This is a story of a young man with a club foot facing down troubles as they come, but also having to deal with his fragile self and his blindness to do so much for others who don't care for him. This is definitely one of the best books I've read in the past year and will always remain a true classic.	2004-03-16

While there are some very good scenes of how absolutely nutty and maddening the employers are to their help, in the end, it's a very dark look into the lives of the upper classes.<br /><br />Again, the familiar plaintive cry comes from my lips, \\"Why the heck did she put up with such abuse?\\" She wasn't Jane Eyre, she wasn't trapped in a situation that she had no escape from. This is one of the weakest parts of the book and I found myself starting to feel a low level of contempt for the spineless narrator.<br /><br />All this, plus a romance subplot that is hastily thrown into the proceedings with needing to be there.  I'd almost swear money that the romance angle was an editorial decision after reading the galley and not seeing enough sex and romance. It fits very awkwardly into the framework of the rest of the book. (Secondly, who in the world eats Ben and Jerry's on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum in December???)<br /><br />Coupled with an extremely unsatisfying climax, this book could have been better but alas, it is stuck firmly in the world of the mediocre.	2004-03-11

I had been reading some heavier books, and put them aside to read this. I was a fan of If Looks Could Kill and was hoping that this book would fulfill the promise that White had shown in her first novel.  She does. I, for opne, was glad to see Bailey taken out of New York and put in a New England setting ... we know this was only temporary for Bailey is a real New Yorker. White is very good at introducing multiple characters and red herrings and she really keeps you guessing until the end.  The most refreshing thing about this book is how everybody at this spa seems to have a secret and nobody is squeaky clean. This book is a fun read, and White's prose is intelligent and cleverly written so you don't have to worry about mediocre writing. A great read while curled up in your chair.	2003-10-06

Toklas	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Wonderful	Those looking for a straightforward narrative, go elsewhere but those looking for charming insights into the heart of the Parisian bohemian scene from roughly 1905-1933, this is the book. Stein's genius was to write the book as if one was actually having a conversation with her partner, Alice B. Toklas. Famous figures come in and out of the story: Matisse, Picasso, Braque, Fitzgerald, Hemingway. Not only is this a book about people but it's also a book about the heady days before World War 1 and the general unease and regrouping that was done after the war. You get plenty of insights about the art scene, and by the end of the book, find yourself wishing you could be sitting in Stein's salon, looking at all the paintings.<br />This book can be read straight through from cover to cover or it can be read in bits and pieces and there is no lack of enjoyment from reaidng it either way.	2003-08-14

More than just a war-torn romance story, it's a very real depiction of the horrors of battle.  While this formula has been come to be viewed as vintage Hemingway, those reading the book for the first time will see it as a fresh and original story.  I had no idea what would happen from one chapter to the next and the ending of the books comes as a harsh surprise (although a throughly logical one.)<br />This is one of the most important novels about World War 1 and the effects it had on the people involved with it.	2003-08-14

As recounted in Hemingway's memoir \\"A Moveabe Feast\\", none other than Gertrude Stein was very critical of Hemingway's earlier works and gave him some disparaging criticism. Over 80 years have passed, and Hemingway is still widely read today, and with good reason: the man was a born writer.<br />Hemingway's first novel is a story of the \\"lost generation\\"; those who came of age during World War 1 and lived as expatriates in Paris.  The hero of the story is Jake Barnes, a man suffering from a bad injury during the war and his relationships.  Never boring, the book is at its best when the more everyday aspects of life intrude upon the narrative. The characters are all sharply drawn. I was at first worried about the bull-fighting sequences, not because I am opposed to the sport, but because I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to sustain interest, but the passages are so well-written that it's no problem. Hemingway's first is a good place to start to get used to his narrative technique. He's one of the earliest writers I have encountered who can write about \\"nothing\\" and make it Something.	2003-08-14

Since I attended college and spent many years hanging out in the environs of Amherst and Northampton, Massachusetts, I can say that the physical world Burroughs evokes is a true one. I am just not sure if his life is.<br />This book portrays a series of events and people that are so far off-balance and off-kilter that it's hard to really believe that this happened to Burroughs. Whether or not Burroughs only took select events to present and embellish, the result is so out there that the center really doesn't hold. I ended up viewing this book more as a novel than a memoir.<br />Some of the more questionable facets of this book are moments where Burroughs seems to recall every detail, every facial tic during conversations that had occurred almost 25 years earlier. (A similar fault that I saw with Mary Karr's \\"The Liar's Club.\\")<br />Running with Scissors is an enjoyable enough read, and amusing, but I think it tries to hard to be a bit clever and skewed. The sex scenes with a much older man are not only explicit but disturbing. Not for the faint of heart.	2003-04-21

Ellis' writing style is mature, fluid and almost too knowing.  He is also writing about what he (presumably) knows: the bleak landscape and soulscape of the wealthy in 1980's Los Angeles.<br />Not so much a novel as a series of vignettes experienced by Clay during his semester break from his New Hampshire college, the novel follows Clay as he tries to reconnect with his old friends, and witnesses the amoral lives of those he once knew but now feels disconnected from.  We follow a cast of characters of rich, self-centered fathers, weak,  ineffectual mothers, and friends who have a lifestyle well beyond what the majority of those in the United States have ever experienced. In the majority of his works, Ellis writes from the vantage point of the rich and privileged, only occasionally providing glimpses of the \\"hoi polloi\\" who live well beneath the means of the main characters and the simmering class struggle that exists at the core of America.<br />It was very hard for me to grow a real fondness for any of the characters as they all seemed to be zombies and old beyond their years.  Perhaps that is Ellis' point.  Despite baking underneath the California sun, the characters have become automatons, going through the routine of life in such a haze that nothing matters.  And in ture Ellis fashion, other people are seen as little more than respositories for sex or drugs, used for that fleeting instant to get a quick high. This reveals itself in the end in two rather grotesque scenes that are back to back and show just how desensitized these people have become.<br />This book definitely shows all the promise that was fulfilled in Ellis' second novel, \\"The Rules of Attraction\\" and the promise that was lost in the overly ambitious and gratuitous-on-many-levels \\"American Psycho.\\" I think it would be interesting one day to have Ellis write about those who are a few more rungs down that social ladder. I don't feel that he *has* to do so, or really even needs to, but if he is so willing to expose the lives of the rich, good Lord, what does he think of the rest of us?those who are a few more rungs down that social ladder.

At first I found the book to be expert satire about the go-go 80's, but as the book went on, I grew weary of the endless clothing descriptions, the graphic sex and the just as graphic violence.  I got the point early on in the novel, and frankly as the book goes on and the clothing descriptions do not end, it starts to show a lack of imagination.  I never thought it would be possible to be so bored by a book with such a premise, but I did.  Strictly for hardcore (no pun intended) fans.	2003-04-10

A dark look at higher education at small liberal arts college in New England in the 80's. The title of the novel is alsmot a joke because at this college, there are no rules for anything.  Everything is fair game, and identity, sexuality and emotions blur and bend with frightening intensity.<br />There is no real accurate way to describe this novel except by saying that the summary on the back of the book in no way can convey the mastery of narration and flow that Ellis has achieved. Stream of consciousness, multiple narrators, unreliable narrators all mesh together to form one of the most convincing portraits of the go-go 80's. It's amazing Ellis actually did write the book in the 80's as one could dwear he was throwing in references and all to sweeten the period feel, a la The Wedding Singer. But I know for a fact that this book came out in the 80's because not only does the copyright prove it, but I remember seeing it on book shelves back then.<br />The characters all emerge as very interesting people.  By allowing them to all recite their stories in their own voices, you're able to clearly see their own failures and strengths and complexities.  Ellis often shows the same version of events from 2 different viewpoints and the result is a hilarious mix of misunderstandings and mixed signals.  At the same time, it made me feel rather uneasy and I thought, \\"Is this how life is too? We all fool ourselves into believing what really isn't there?\\" This book is a great and absorbing read written by a masterful author who seems as if he was at the premature top of his game. This novel will most likely need to be read a few times... but that's no chore.<br />Look for a brief throwaway line about Classics majors not attending a party.  This line clearly anticipates Donna Tartt's \\"The Secret History\\" which has a similar setting ...  not surprising as Tartt and Ellis were college mates and friends at Bennington College in Vermont.	2003-04-08

I knew the rudimentary facts about the United States but (and I am embarrassed to admit) never thought much on it, nor the fundamental ideological differences between the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.  This is a great book about the mythic figures of the founding of the United States and just how fallible they truly were.  This book cleans all the moss and clinging vines from their persons and shows all the squabbles, petty jealousies and rows that these men all had with one another.  One of the most fascinating sections of the book deals with the great silence over the institution of slavery.  Since this book deals with the early history of the country, only a sentence or two is devoted to the aftermath of that silence and how it tore the precious country apart only 70 years after.<br />The book also casts light on the strange adversarial relationship of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. This part of the book shows these men at their most human and, in the end, is rather touching. The fact that these two men died within hours of one another on the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Indpendence is a coincidence too strange to be fiction.<br />Highly recommended, this book is meticulosuly researched and well written yu Joseph Ellis.	2003-04-08

I haven't trusted King's \\"new\\" material since the safe deposit box trick he \\"reveals\\" in \\"Bag of Bones\\" ... does King, like \\"Bag's\\" main character, just keep stories in a safe deposit box and pull them out when he needs to be published or is everything new and fresh? I am not sure, but whatever the case, \\"Everything's Eventual\\" is one of King's best short story collections. King's real strength comes through when he is writing a streamlined short story or novella.  His novels are wonderful although the ones with the bigger vision: Needful Things, The Stand The Dark Tower series just don't encapsulate how great and clever a writer this man has truly become.<br />Some criticize King, now calling him a \\"New Yorker baby\\". And what's wrong with that? If \\"The New Yorker\\" can recognize that King has just as much talent and flair for telling a story as the best literary writers out there, I would just say, \\"What took them so darn long?\\" This new collection is a great mix of King's attention to details and landscape, as well as the stuff that can really scare us. One of the most effective short stories is \\"The Man in the Black Suit\\" which literally gave me the willies.  (If the willies are indeed a literal thing.) As a young boy terrified of the devil, this story brought back all my childhood fears. \\"Riding the Bullet\\" and \\"The Road Virus Heads North\\" show that King has not lost any of his talent for the macabre.  These two tales in particular would not have been out of place in earlier short story collections such as \\"Night Shift\\" or \\"Skeleton Crew\\".  King does stumble some with  a few of his tales: the buildup to \\"1408\\" ends up being much scarier than the actual events in the haunted hotel room.  This is a case where less would have been more. \\"Lunch at the Gotham Cafe\\" just seems a bit motiveless and never achieves any sense of denouement, and \\"L.T.'s Theory of Pets\\", as others have pointed out in their reviews, just seems to go nowhere and instead of being a \\"just so\\" story, is a \\"so what?\\" story.<br />Despite the few drawbacks, King still writes intelligent fiction, he is high and above any of his contemporaries in popular fiction.  This is the reason he has lasted so long.

Unlike Stephen Carter's \\"The Emperor of Ocean Park\\", this is a lean, focused mystery.  Well, maybe a little too lean but as debuts go, this book held my attention from the first page and made me continue reading until the mystery was solved.  The writing is assured, and not wooden or forced.  I do agree with some readers who feel the climax was a bit rushed.  We spend the whole book wading through red herrings and clues, and when the mystery is finally solved, there is about a half a page of action and that's it.  It's a dull thud rather than a fiery denoument.<br />Bailey Weggins is an enjoyable enough narrator, although I do wish that writers would get off their \\"Sex and the City\\" kick.  I am not saying Bailey shouldn't have had a complex life but this whole single woman in Manhattan looking for love (and sex) in all the wrong places is rapidly becoming tired. I love strong women in literature, but it's dull when they always need to have a man attached, or be defined by their men and their sex lives. Come on, the women of the world deserve better in the new Millennium.  The women in this book (not just Bailey) all seem a little too defined by their material lives, their men, their clothes, their jobs and their gourmet food. It makes them all seem a bit hollow. Yes, I know this was a Kelly Ripa book selection and that just means fun, fluffy reading, but had Bailey been a bit more introspective, I think she'd have come across even better. Well, I suppose we can all wait for the next book.  It would seem that this is the first in a series of Bailey Weggins books;  if they are as enjoyable as this one, Kate White stands to do quite well.	2002-08-22

The book begins immediately with a violent and disturbing act.  From this, we get the unique point of view of the victim looking down from Heaven on the people whom her murder has affacted: her family, her friends, acquaintances and even the killer himself.  While this sounds like the stuff of saccharine drama, it works ... for a while.  The book is not schmaltzy, but sad and enlightening.<br />It is interesting to watch the characters grow and change in the aftermath of the murder, even moreso since they are being observed the entire time.  The book tends to run a bit long in the end, and suffers from a few supernatural twists that ruin the gravity of the situation and the reality of life on Earth (despite our narrator's heavenly vantage point), but despite that, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is a book worth reading.	2002-08-22

How does one deal when the man you are falling out of love with suddenly suffers a life threatening accident that leaves him quadriplegic?  Carrie's answer is to run.  I think many have criticized the narration of the novel as being so slow and emotionless, but I think Carrie is just in shock for most of the novel.  The accident and the fallout from it has just left her dazed, and nobody seems to understand her or wants to.  I do agree with another reviewer that everybody seems to handle her disappearance a little too matter of factly. Give me a break, they would have been worried out of their minds.  Carrie is an imperfect person, and while I don't always applaud the judgement calls she has made, i cannot say it made for a bad book.<br />The biggest flaw in the novel are the New York sequences. Whereas Madison, Wisconsin seems populated with real people, and real lingo (Packer has a real ear for the way young people trapped between college and real life speak), New York just seems to come across as a bleak, depressing place where even people's language is pretentious and meaningless. The shift to New York weighs the book down, and I found myself starting to become a bit impatient with the writing style. Carrie ends up in a relationship with an older man who, despite his protestations at being real, comes across as pretentious and artifical as everybody else in the city.  I live in New York but did not recognize or like the city Packer was writing about.<br />The novel picks up again in its last third as Carrie is forced to look at herself and the people in her life and make a decision, but by then, I had started to grow tired of a lot of the characters and situations.  I was glad that the book came back to life, but it was too late.

I would have loved to have had this book around 15 years ago when I needed it.  Now, I just see it as 4 paint by the number stories that portray gay life as shallow, unsatisying and sadly hollow.  Many of these stories end up with the same plot twists (which any astute reader can see coming a mile away)and cookie cutter characters who seem to think only of sex, liquor and men (not always in that order.) The worst offender is Ben Tyler, who wraps up the collection. Tyler has a lot to learn about writing, with his junior high-level style writing and jaw droppingly bad similes.  The other three stories fare a bit better ... but not much. Characters fall in love in minutes, hearts are broken, men are cast aside like Kleenex, and the reader is supposed to think \\"Oh, what romance!\\" The two middle stories, \\"A Perfect Husband\\" and \\"The Outline of a Torso\\" fare somewhat better since the writing style is a bit more professional, but the stories themselves are a bit weak and suffer, as the other two stories do, from protagonists who are so self involved and shallow that they left me cold.<br />This leads to the question as to why I bothered to even give it 2 and a half stars? The reason being is that while this book is not something I liked or go for, why CAN'T we have such books? After being fed a steady diet of similar stories in our lifetime from a heterosexual point of view, the gay community should also have a variety of nice, frothy reads, even if I realized I don't like this style book.  As I said, had this book been around 15 years ago when i needed it, I'd have loved it.  No doubt there are guys out there who need this book now ... and it's important that it's here, whether I like it or not.	2002-08-14

A small, depressed town that time forgot where people tend to go through the motions of life, clinging to the hope of an economic miracle that never seems to happen.  A coworker told me that this is the real America, there are more towns like this than there are the bustling big cities. Russo's towns come to life with his vivid descriptions and three dimensional characters.<br />In &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot;, set in the mid-1980's in upstate New York, we meet Sully, a mostly harmless guy who seems to raise the ire of about everybody he meets, with the exception of his best friend and his landlady. True, Sully can be a real pain in the neck, but he's oh so fun to read about, what with his troubles with his dad's ghost, his distant son, his sometime employer, his slow best friend, and the subplot about a spastic Doberman and the volley over a stolen snowblower.  I could go on and on, but it's too complex to compress into a short review.<br /> Russo has a way of making you wonder exactly how things will turn out for our protagonists, since many of them paint themselves into a corner (see also Russo's &quot;Straight Man&quot;.) This book is a thick read, but I wished it had gone on even longer.  I did not find myself wishing that the book was about 100 pages shorter, or that there was a better interplay of action and dialogue.  This book is Russo at top form, and it shows. Every page in this book is a delight and despite the heft, the story is over much too soon.  Highly recommended.	2002-08-01
US	51304688	R1PSHZPBHWLCP0	0375413634	70225414	The Emperor of Ocean Park	Books	2	1	2	N	N	Satisfying, but not a revelation	\\"Emperor of Ocean Park\\" is two novels in one. The first is the story of a man facing the disintegration of his family and ideals that reads like a reactionary tract (i.e., ambitious, career minded wife who only thinks of money and her job). The second story is a murder mystery/thriller of sorts. The combination of the two themes strikes many as being fresh and unique, but quite honestly, while the racial theme is indeed a breath of fresh air, the interweaving of domestic drama, complex mystery and red herrings by the truckload has been done many times on television shows such as \\"The Edge of Night\\" and \\"As the World Turns.\\" This does not diminish Carter's work, indeed, nobody told a story like \\"Edge\\" or \\"World\\" in their heydays, but as far as being new and unique, \\"Emperor\\" isn't. While these combined themes of family and crime work on the small screen where they unravel for months at a time, \\"Emperor\\" tends to feel a bit crammed with subplots and extraneous characters. I had difficulty at times trying to keep all the characters straight, what with the various nicknames, surnames, and familial connections. There are so many characters in this novel (and so many of them unlikeable) that I would often spend several minutes trying to remember whom the narrator was talking about.<br />This book was enjoyable (if a bit over the top) as a mystery, but the narration of the novel is a bit flat. I can't say I felt much for the narrator, Tal, Talcott, Misha. It's hard to feel much for a narrator who accentuates the negative. The negativity and bitterness in the character sometimes just went a bit too far. Except when it came to his son. Oh lord, he loves his son Bentley, as we learn over and over (mainly because he keeps saying it - methinks the man doth protest too much). Unfortunately, I, the constant reader, came to loathe his son who refers to himself in the 3rd person and says \\"pwaygrown\\" so many times that you wonder if Carter was being paid by the word. Hint to all writers: let us now and forever place a moratorium on baby talk and gibberish; it's not cute, it's just silly.<br />Parts of the novel seemed rather implausible, and none more than the academic dinner party where the Baptist Minister holds court talking about the power and evil of Satan while everybody politely listens. First off: why the odd juxtaposition of guests? Secondly: academics listening politely? Give me a break. The scene was much harder to digest than even the action packed, begging-to-be-a-movie climax of the novel. The entire scene was forced. I sure wouldn't want to have a man expounding on Satan while I am trying to eat my salad.<br />This is a fair first novel. The writing does keep you guessing, and slapping your forehead with \\"Oh my gosh, that's who it is!\\" which is a joy. At the same time, the tendency of Carter to end every chapter on a cliffhanger (a favorite literary device of R.L. Stine in his \\"Fear Street\\" books), the (at times) absurd mystery and clues (complete with a \\"Yes, yes it was me all along and now you die, ha ha ha ha ha!\\" villain), the negative, reactionary tone and the one note characters, not to mention the mysterious ability of Talcott Garland to not knowing how to \\"wink\\" to magically \\"winking\\" 100 pages later tend to keep this novel from being truly great. Nevertheless, this a summer read that you won't forget.<br />Carter has the intelligence and writing flair to keep this novel from being a waste of time. His reflections on the African-American middle class adds a unique twist, one inetresting enough that I hope Carter will explore it more in future (and less pessismistic) novels. \\"The Emperor of Ocean Park\\" is not in the league of Rohinton Mistry's \\"A Fine Balance\\" or Richard Russo's \\"Nobody's Fool\\", but it's a notable debut nonetheless.iters: let us now and forever place a moratorium on baby talk and gibberish; it's not cute, it's just silly.<br />Parts of the novel seemed rather implausible, and none more than the academic dinner party where the Baptist Minister holds court talking about the power and evil of Satan while everybody politely listens.

Despite what Moore may have had in mind while writing this novel,  her combination of florid, poetic prose and graphic sex and violence just don't mix. This book is the literary equivalent of a snuff film. Never mind what Moore was trying to achieve (and her radiant, angelic author photo on the hardcover edition makes it seem as if she sees herself as literature's savior)with her story, underneath the prose, there is a by the numbers thriller full of red herrings, the obligatory surprise revelation, and a violent, sick ending that tries to go one better than \\"Looking for Mr. Goodbar.\\"  Whatever Moore was trying to say gets lost amidst the gore and sex.

US	51304688	R1VX88ML9ZHUT8	0375414517	451075551	Angel Rock	Books	3	5	7	N	N	Fair but not Great	Angel Rock is a book that never seems to entirely come together.  I often felt that the author was trying to write a literary combination of \\"Twin Peaks\\" and \\"Picnic at Hanging Rock,\\" but he doesn't really succeed at either.  Despite a promising beginning with the layout of the town established and its people introduced, the book tends to be a rather flatly written story with very little to surprise the reader or hold their attention for too long.  Yes, there are two mysteries at the core of the novel, one of a missing child, and the other of a teenage suicide but they fail to really grab onto you and get under your skin.  Instead, with too many characters for such a short book (one of the biggest flaws is the character of the detective, his addition to the story makes him an unnecessary appendage of literary invention), and too many jumps back and forth with point of view left me feeling a little muddled and therefore could not really identify or graft onto any particular character.  Williams writes the novel in a detached way that made me feel like I was reading and witnessing the action through a thick sheet of smudged plexiglass. I wish I could have seen more, but there was just too much in the way.  Williams shows promise but \\"Angel Rock\\" is not a book that would promise a dazzling career.	2002-07-29

The downtown aras which were once busy are home only to bridal shops.  The more enterprising towns are now filled with antique stores...  Empire Falls is such a town.<br />I recently had a lot of time on my hands, and not a lot of books to read.  My roommate suggested this book to me...  This book won the Pulitzer, so that was a decent recommendation to begin with.  I sped through this novel in 2 days. Russo has created a wonderful \\"empire\\" of his own with this novel.  Everybody's lives weave in and out of one anothers.  The setting, a depressed town in Central Maine, is like many of those towns in the Northeast that were once prosperous, and are now mere asterisks on a map... Russo has a great eye for the way these townspeople talk and think, much like his characters in the brilliant \\"Nobody's Fool.\\"<br /> The manager of the grill, his angry brother, the never happy ex-wife, the rich mill owner's widow all come to life in this book...  I recommend this book to anybody, it's a great read and en enjoyable one.  The plot twists can be very surprising, and one of the climactic scenes left me shaking my head, I had not seen it coming at all...	2002-07-26

(Dorothy Parker)<br />This book was a huge disappointment from beginning to end.  To begin with, I felt that many of the characters were forced stereotypes. It didn't work.  I thought the writing and dialogue were below average.  No girl could possibly go through all the trauma that this girl does in the book and come out okay. She seems remarkably well adjusted for a young girl who endures a shooting, statutory rape (and that's only the first foster home) among other tragedies. That's because I don't know that many girls would be forced to undergo so much without a social worker finally asking, \\"What the heck is with these foster families?\\"  While this book is purportedly her coming of age, it reads like a treatise against the entire foster care industry.  I read this book because I was alone in a house and there was nothing to read but this.<br />The most false note in this book is the character of the mother.  She is so unlikable, and so unrealistic.  I kept wishing that the daughter would just tell her mother to shut up.  With such a character, I had no sympathy for what happened to her.  I think that this book is a poorly written, poorly planned out novel, and it's one that I will never recommend to anybody, except to pan it.	2002-07-25

Chabon's use of language and imagery in this book is unparalleled.  Despite the book's thick length and tiny print, I did not want to stop reading this novel. The characters are all well drawn out, and are three dimensional.  Of particular interest to me as a kid who loved comics was seeing how much the charcters own lives affected the creation of their comic books.  Brilliant.  Chabon so wisely uses real and imagined heros of the comic business that even though I know the book is fiction, started wondering where I could find these amazing comics.<br />The books only flaw is about the last 100 pages where the narrative begins to drag.  Also, the introduction of a young kid feels a bit intrusive.  While the child is a major plot element, it just feels too late in the game to introduce a new character with whom we are supposed to become involved with.  However, the rest of the book is just so enjoyable, so fun (yes surprsingly serious and solemn at parts) that I hope this book continues to be read.	2002-07-22

Journey is the story of one man, Gustad Noble,  facing a set of challenges in Bombay in 1971 (the year of the war with Pakistan.) Mistry also tells several different stories as the characters weave in and out of Gustad's life.  Some of it works, some of it doesn't.  You can predict some of the fates of the characters right from the beginning.  But Mistry has written a solid book, and shows the promise that he fulfilled quite nicely in a Fine Balance.	2002-03-09

I knew this was a good book when I would find myself crawling into bed at the end of the day and just reading.  I would look forward to the trainride home so I could read, i did not want to speak to anybody so i could read more.  Mistry has a masterpiece on his hands here, which is why I am disappointed to learn that this was one of the less popular Oprah selections. Cheers to Oprah for having chosen this book as I would never have picked it up myself.<br />The story of the 4 strangers who come together in 1975 in a flat in the City (most likely Bombay, but never named)during a time of great crisis in India is a sprawling, complex work.  To his credit, Mistry not only makes this book readable but it goes very quickly.  I was never bored, and before I knew it, I had read the 600 plus pages, and was sad when the book ended. The charcters in this novel become so real, and are so well developed that you cna't help but feel a big loss when the book is over.  I literally did laugh and cry while reading this book, and that seldom, if ever, has happened before, at least to this extent.<br />I urge everybody who looks at the size of the book, or feels the subject matter wouldn't be to their liking, to look it over again. This novel is worth it, and it's good to take a look at the world outside of the United States.  It's not always a fun read, the characters come across some very tough obstacles, and I was flinching in some scenes, but due to the talent of the storyteller, I kept on reading. Highly recommended.	2002-03-07

Beezus and Ramona focused on Beezus and her inner thoughts, and Ramona was just an antagonistic presence that Beezus had to endure. For the first time, we get to be inside Ramona's head. Up to this point, all Ramona did was cause trouble for Beezus, and Henry and everybody else on Klickitat Street. But this book gives us the chance to see things from Ramona's perspective, and you know what... it makes sense. Suddenly, Ramona ceases being the neighborhood pain to a little girl who really wants to be noticed and loved. (You can even see it in the earlier books that Ramona is the youngest child in her neighborhood, hence her refuge in television and make believe). rereading thsi book as an adult, the scene with Ramona in kingergarten are so real, as are the descriptions of Miss Binney, the first year teacher who occasionally doesn't really know what to make of her students. Clearly, these were things that college didn't prepare her for. This is a great introduction to the MIND of Ramona, and prepares for lots of enjoyments of the ups and downs in Ramona's life in the years to come. It also introduces many characters who are integral later down the road, including arch-enemy Susan. Of particular note are the still enjoyable drawings of the late Louis Darling who perfectly captures the innocence of kindergraten, and the feelings of a little girl who just wants to be seen as special.	2001-07-20

It was a surprise to see this book on the shelves since I had assumed that Beverly Cleary was retired, and through with Ramona and friends.  I was glad to have my assumption proven wrong.  The usual cast of characters is back, with new additions as well. Some may not like the fact that Howie has pretty much vanished, but it's very realistic of Cleary to have Howie and Ramona grow apart as they get older. It was also fun to see Susan return to get on Ramona's nerves. Ramona is older now, she's a big sister, so she is no longer the little girl who craved attention and dropped out of kindergarten, but it's nice to see her still having trouble, even though her intentions are good. Once again, Cleary captures childhood very well.  Children's literature, and children, have come a long way from the days of Henry Huggins and the children's exclamations of &quot;gee whilikers&quot;, but Cleary does show that underneath any of the &quot;corruption&quot; that is purported to be corruptin the youth of the world, children are still children. True, it's hard to believe that Beezus would have worn such an awful outfit to a first boy/girl party (and at the age of 14 no less... her first one...Beezus is 51 years old now, you'd have thought she'd been to one before now!) That aside, this book is well worth the read, and if Cleary ever writes another, I'll be in line waiting for it.	2001-07-20

Perhaps the only drawback I see to this novel is that there are a few too many shifts in perspective, and by the time we are ready to have the story end, we get introduced to new characters and have to read all about their history.  But that is a small complaint. The rest of this first novel is vintage Morrison.  Granted, her voice is still rather new in this book, and the elements don't quite gel as well as they will in future novels, but we get to see Morrison at the beginning of her writing that will eventually lead her down the path to the Nobel Prize in Literature.  Of course, this is not always an easy read.  In fact, this story is full of ugliness and horror that leaves the reader in need of a long, head clearing walk afterwards.  However, many people label this story as being just too depressing, or a real downer.  I don't see it that way. Perhaps this is because Morrison tends to distance us from the events at times by telling the story partly through the perspective of so many different narrators.  I hardly think this story is too depressing to read.  After all, just a few short years ago, Americans (and the world) were lining up to see a movie about a ship that sinks, killing over a thousand. This book is far more developed, and engrossig than that film.  Don't listen to the naysayers, read this book, not only for the craftsmanship, but to read the first novel in what becomes for Morrison a brilliant career.	2001-06-04

It doesn't.  I was expecting the entire book to be about the trip to Alabama, and not just the last three chapters.  The rest of the book is a bit jerky, as it's highly episodic.  While certain events in the book do lead to the trip down South, I have to say that this book does not necessarily form a cohesive whole.<br />That said, I do give Curtis great credit for writing a book about this era in history, and making it interesting and educational at the same time.  Curtis also does not spare the emotions and feelings of the characters either.  No longer do we have to read about a bunh of docile people staring great tragedy in the face and making excuses.  The characters in this book know that the actionsof the racists are bad, know that the spitting and leering people following the African American children into the schools are wrong.  This made a difference to me as I read the book. It was refreshing to hear these characters call this behavior evil and reprehensible. Perhaps for too long many authors have been afraid to pin such adjectives on the perpetrators of these crimes, especially in children's/young adult books, but I am glad that the anger shows, and that these characters are affected and angry by the turn of events. Of course, I would also hope that this book would foster discussion of the events, and the entire Civil Rights era. Curtis thankfully has a post-script at the end of the book, explaining the events in clear, understandable prose that the reader will find just as interesting as the main story. I am glad that this book got the recognition that it did.	2001-06-04

Most notable about these books is that they just follow the lives of the various characters in their stories who just happen to be Latino. Except for the glossary at the end of the book, this book was not written to &quot;introduce&quot; us gringo's to another culture.  Rather, it's a book about boys and girls who have the same dreams and aspirations that are universal. These characters do not set out to change the world, but rather just get by day by day in the little space of earth that they inhabit. Very well done, perhaps written a bit simply at times, but for the most part, these stories are enjoyable.	2001-05-31

This story also deals with monsters, ... but of a different kind.  This story would seem to bear more than a passing resemblance to the movie, &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, but this book was in the planning stages long before that film made it to production.  The artwork in this book is simply entrancing (although it seems a bit faded, I am not sure if that is the desired effect or because of the plates fading after a number of years.)  This book is still a great read.  There is some concern that it may be a bit too mature for younger readers, but I know that as a kid, I would have found this story fascinating.  It's an &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; without the sunny golden days, a world in which everything has gone amuck.  This is one of the high points of Sendak's work.	2001-05-31

This book had me in tears of laughter, and I was even happier to learn just as I finished it that Rennison has written a sequel.  Georgia is a wonderful throwback to the days when female young adult characters had real spunk... I am thinking of Annabel Andrews, and Harriet the Spy.  Her misadventures are ones that we can all relate to, but somehow, these events all seem much funnier when they are happening to somebody else.  I also give Rennison credit for her depiction of the parents here as being very real people, and not cardboard cutouts.  The fact that Georgia's parents are complex beings frustrates her, and that just adds to the mix.  Yes, this book is definitely a must read for all of those on either side of the Atlantic.  A previous posting to this list commented that Georgia made &quot;homophobic&quot; comments.  As unfortunate as that is, this is most probably the mindset of a young girl, and I did not see any of Georgia's comments as especially mean, just uninformed. There is another, very minor character in this book who could very probably be gay, but Georgia never seems to pick up on that, even though the reader does.  Again, I just view it as the fact that Georgia is just very young.  I am eagerly awaiting the third book to be published here in the States, but it may take awhile. In the meantime, enjoy this.	2001-05-31

Instead, this is the story of Toby's coming of age during the summer of 1971 when the only constant in the small town of Antler, Texas is change.  I enjoyed this book, along with Holt's extremely vivid details of the town of Antler and its denizens.  Holt has the gift of taking certain cliched situations (yet another story of a friend's brother in Viet Nam, and the stranger who stirs up things in town) and gives them a new, non-cliched literary lives.  This is not to say that there still are not moments in the book when things don't ring entirely true (Toby's mother Opalina, while never seen, aspires to be a country western singer and moves to Nashville, yet by the descriptions of her, I can only picture her as a character in Robert Altman's 1975 magnum opus film, &quot;Nashville&quot;.) The denouement of the novel also seems to come a bit too quickly, but again, this is two sided as Holt does her best to not deliver us a 100% neat ending.<br />Other than these little problems, I do find this book a rather engaging and fun read.  The town that Holt creates seems to be an interesting one.  True, while it may be boring to Toby, it intrigues somebody like me who has lived his entire life in New England and never got to experience such a place.  Recommended.	2001-05-24

Many major and key players from LOTR are introduced here, not to mention the extremely important moment when Bilbo Baggins finds a lost ring in the caves under the mountain.  This story is less than 100 years old, yet it resonates and feels like Tolkien was basically rewriting old myths.  The argument for this can indeed come from some of the source materials that Tolkien used, but as far as I can see, the story is wholly original.  It's wonderful that in the age when everything was modern and sleek, Tolkien gifted the world with this age old story. This book may have been written for kids, but I have noticed that many more adults seem to enjoy it than children. It may be Tolkien's overly descriptive language can turn kids off, but this book is definitely worth the read.	2001-05-24

It just could not happen fast enough for me.  Finally, all 4 were out, and I was happy. Then they came out with this book that collects all four books in one volume for the first time, and I bought this too.  Why did I buy this?  Well, for one thing, the new Hilary Knight cover is rather fabulous.  I am all for new Knight artwork whenever it appears, and this cover was obviously not dashed out but carefully drawn, and it shows.  This is definitely worth having for the Eloise fan.	2001-05-24

And of course, I loved every minute of it. Faulkner's genius in this book is in the way he tells the story of Caddy Compson, but he only tells it through everybody else's eyes.  Caddy herself never appears as the narrator of her own tale.  There is a lot to say on this book.  A lot has been written and debated, but one can only truly experience this book by being patient, and sitting down and spending time with it.  This is not a quick read, but it's a great one.  Note: there are many websites that do help with the narrative, but I would not recommend reading any of those until you have completed the book itself.	2001-05-24

Those who are only familiar with Knight's wonderful pen and ink drawings for Eloise and Mrs. Piggle Wiggle will be amazed at the beauty of his full color illustrations. This book is good enough for either your child's/nephew's/niece's bookshelf, or (in my case) your own. The illustrations of a young boy and girl slowly becoming part of the tale are beautifully rendered. I am glad to see so many Knight books on the market again, and hope that i will get to see some more.	2001-05-22

I first read this book 20 years ago when I was in the 4th grade, and I enjoyed it. The concept of a daughter waking up in her mother's body is intriguing, and funny.  I just reread this book last week, and I was on the floor laughing.  Rodgers has written a book that works well with all ages, and I found it even funnier this time around. From the crush on Boris Harris, to the funniest parent-teacher conference ever, this book just moves on and on, and never ceases to be amusing. Even more interesting is the little mystery throughout the book of who is inhabiting Annabel's body that day.  As a 4th grader, I loved the premise, as an adult, I love the wordplay, and the whole mixed up situation that allows Annabel to see thw world through an adults eyes.  My only real gripe with the book at this point has nothing to do with Rodger;s writing, but rather the cover in paperback. We see Annabel looking in the mirror at a rather frumpish looking mother, which, if you read the book, is not at all how the mother really looks (a better idea is to picture Barbara Harris who plays Mom in the movie, and does seem to resemble the physical characteristics as Rodgers describes them.) If I were not such an advocate of book collecting and preservation, I'd advise you to rip off the cover, but my best advice to you here is to just ignore it. Otherwise, have a great time with this book.	2001-05-22

Even after coming to the end, I couldn't stop musing on it, and was moved. As I say in my subject line, this house truly is haunted, not by dancing ectoplasm and weird visions, but haunted with the past, and feelings of loss, betrayal, rage and murderous impulses. If it weren't for the house, and all the expectations and feelings put upon it, there would be no story. Some things about the story begged examination, (would the county really have been as lax as to have such a huge mistake occur that results in the loss of Kathy's home?), but it made for an enjoyable read nonetheless.  It's also not an easy read.  Indeed, when I reached the end, I did feel (like the blurbs promised) that I had read a story modeled after the conventions of Greek tragedy.<br />While I can understand of lot of the negativity toward this novel, I have to say that I enjoyed it.  Dubus III is a good writer (and has inspired me to seek out the other Andre Dubus), and he also portrays an America today as it really is, with all different groups of people mingling, and this forms one of the biggest misunderstandings of the book. It's a nice change of pace to see an author show how much America has changed, and keeps changing.<br />Dubus is especially skillful at testing us with divided loyalty.  We will find ourselves rooting for one character, but then something will happen, and we will change our minds, only to change it back again.  There are no all good or all bad characters in this book, just people whose lives have all reached a point where pride and prejudice push them to the limits. I do agree with some of the critiques of the character of the Deputy.  If Dubus had spread the story over a larger timeframe, perhaps we could see his actions as more fitting to his character as compared to the rash judgements he makes after what seems like a timespan of less than a week.<br />However,I will advise the reader that this book is well written, and well executed.  One reviewer said to only read Part 1, and dispense with Part 2.  I will not say that is wrong advice, but I am not one who could read so far into a book and then abandon it.  I couldn't put the book down after Part 1, even though I could slowly see where things were going and even I, the reader, felt completely powerless. Highly recommended.eviewer said to only read Part 1, and dispense with Part 2.  I will not say that is wrong advice, but I am not one who could read so far into a book and then abandon it.

I am glad this book was not written/published until the 25th anniversary of the movie, as enough time has passed for an objective view of the film to be made.  There is no denying that this is a powerful, interesting and even disturbing film.  I am espcially pleased that a great number of the actors took part in this book.

Why does Ruth maintain that she drowned? What happened to Ruth's mother that November night she disappeared? What does Amanda know about this, and why is her hand scarred? And most importantly, what caused Amanda's nervous breakdown in Milwaukee... was it fatigue, or something more?<br />This novel, recommended to me by a friend, begins with these questions (trust me, I am not giving anything away), and then slowly, the secrets are revealed by multiple narrators.  This book kept me up way past my bedtime. It's a quick read, and despite the heavy-handed sounding plot, it's not a depressing read either.<br />As the novel wears on, it falls into a little bit of predictability.  Certain events, and chance meetings happen that would only surprise people who aren't familiar with any of the conventions of the daytime serial. Schwarz also makes the mistake of changing the focus of the story from Amanda and her story, to the lighter, sunnier story of Ruth and her friend Imogene.  Shwarz also removes a character from the main action of the story, and never brings him back into the fold, even though he seemed to be critical to the story developments at first.<br />Nevertheless, this is a very enjoyable debut novel, and one that will cause you to think about it after you have closed the book.	2001-04-02

This is a book that explores the 1920's New York scene, as well as the great migration North.  Trying to encapsulate everything in this review would be too hard.  On the surface, this story would seem to be one of a love triangle, and the tragic ending.  However, Morrison goes much deeper, and echoes Forster with the credo &quot;only connect&quot;. This is a story of connection, of sex, and list, and emotions veering wildly out of control. The connection comes from making sense of tragedy, as well as the reader connecting with the characters.  It's so hard to dislike those characters you have made moral judgements on, only to find their weaknesses and their humanity outweighs their actions. This is a beautiful novel, and only furthers Morrison's greatness. I will never listen to Jazz music the same way again (and it's a good thing.  I also need to read this book again, as one reading is just not sufficient enough to be able to take it all in.	2001-03-27

This book thrilled me because of the plot twists, (I never saw some things coming), the remarkable breadth of the characters (Snape is so hateful, yet is emerging as one of the most intriguing characters of them all, and in this book, you get to see his first encounter with Harry.) If one wants to read Harry, definitely, they can only start with this book.  Some complain the book is not well written, or sophisticated. Who cares? This book hooked me from beginning to end, (and so many other readers) that it truly is a phenomenon.  This book deserves to be a classic with a long, long shelf life. Once you get past Chapter 1, you're hooked for ever.  And considering that Rowling, like the rest of us is just a Muggle, that is true magic.	2001-03-25

I was expecting a sweet tale about a young girl growing up in Brooklyn, and yes, on the surface, that is what you could say this tale is about.  But even moreso, I found this book to be a good, entertaining read, and it has an edge to it.  This story is surprisingly unsentimental, and surprisingly enought, it's extremely frank in its depiction of adultery, sexuality, and alcoholism.  This is not to say that it's explicit, but the lack of moral judgements make this a refreshingly non-biased look at the girls childhood, and we see things through HER eyes, and not the author's.  This novel is very entertaining, and shows a city in the midst of change, with the influx of immigrants and faces that was slowly changing the face of  early 20th century america.  This is a fun, entertaining and moving book, and one you shouldn't miss. I didn't read it until I was 28, and now wish I had read it many years earlier.	2001-03-21

I didn't quite get it all, but I do remember thinking the book was not such a big deal. I kind of enjoyed it, despite the fact that I wasn't about to face any of the problems that Margaret did. Now, over 20 years later, I had the pleasure of rereading the book, and I found it to still be a good book.  In fact, an even better book than many of the adult novels I have read in my life. And it ages well, Blume is careful not to let too many period details clutter the narrative, and the result is just an all around good tale. In my opinion, it's more Margaret's inquisition into religion that is the main theme of the book, not her awaiting her &quot;visitor&quot; or her breasts.  I think this is a great book for young adults...male or female..., and can still be enjoyed by adults all these years later.	2001-03-20

A friend had recommended it to me, and I never thought a military thriller would grab me.  But doggoneit, this book is one good read. Another good sign is how well I can remember this book a year and a half after I actually read it. DeMille is a good writer.  he keeps the story moving, and the reader enthralled... even though this book has very little in the way of action.  All the real action occurs before the novel begins.  It's the unraveling of the mystery that makes this book so fascinating. Whoever thought a bunch of people walking around and talking to people would be so well done as to keep the reader up all night? Well, this book will make you a believer. Definitely a cut above a regular thriller, DeMille is a talented writer, and I definitely will read more of his work in the future. An intelligent, well crafted novel.	2001-03-19

At the same time, it's so hard to put down that I found myself up late at night just waiting to see what would happen.  Morrison pulls no punches here, from the evils of slavery (and they are depicted in this book as I have never seen them before... with a spare, unflinching look that maks you feel that you are down in the mud and blood with them), to the confusion and turmoil of the post-Civil War years. At its heart is Sethe, and the secret that she carries.  (It would be more fair actually to call it guilt, it's only a secret to the readers... not to most of the characters.) This book will wear you down, but not in a bad way.  The depictions of the horrors are bloodcurdling. This book also is so densely written, and so full of images, and stories and visions that its also hard to put it down with your first reading and say, &quot;Wasn't that pleasant?&quot; and go on and never botehr with it again.  Beloved sticks in your mind like a popcorn kernel between your teeth, and it won't come loose until you work at it some more. This book may have taken a while to read, but even longer to process, and THAT is the sign of a great book, and even better author. Highly recommended.	2001-03-19

Granted, it has not always been an easy love. She speaks truths that I do not always find easy to hear.  She makes statements that I have a difficult time agreeing with. At the same time, I find her writings wonderful, warm and insightful.  She has a way of taking an everyday situation and making it resonate. Of special note in this book is Walker's (to me) classic essay on Flannery O'Connor. What could very easily have been a &quot;what this author means to me&quot; type of story, Walkers manages to tie it up with her own past, her relationships, the legacy of the South and Catholicism.  It's one of my favorite essays of all time, and I am so glad to finally have my own copy to hold onto and read over and over again.  This book is a good start for those who may have only read the Color Purple, but would liek to know more about Walker.  Highly recommended.	2001-03-16

I'm just a white boy from New England, maybe I was afraid that the book wouldn't speak to me, or that I would feel shut out from fully appreciating what it had to offer. At the same time, that never stopped me before from reading all types of books. Morrison just seemed different to me.  Well, I am glad that I finally quit being such a wimp, and took advantage of everything this book had to offer.  From the fantastic opening scene when the insurance collector is about to fly away, to the ending, I could not put this book down, and I would make sure that I would stay awake on the train ride home at night just to get more reading done.  Reading Morrison ahs opened me up to yet another &quot;new&quot; author I have yet to explore, and I am looking forward to the journey.  This was a great place to start, and an absorbing read as well.	2001-03-13

Beginning in Cuba when he was just a child who licked dirt, this story takes us on a ride from the downfall of Batista to the rise of Castro, and the oppression suffered by gays, artists, women and all those who did not fit into Castro's Cuba. Arenas' tale is a powerful one, and not for the faint of heart. I am not referring here to the homosexuality in the book, I am referring to the graphic descriptions of life in prison that Arenas underwent.  That alone is enough to make one put down the book for a while, and take a stroll. In the end, this book is a wonderful, untempered look at rebellion, and escape.  Arenas is not the sad, gentle soul telling a tale. rather, this book is full of fire and anger, and makes it that much more satisfying.

Unfortunately, Karr's style here is a bit jerky, and she too often goes off on long tangents (the opening scene is of something horrible that happened to her when she was 7, but then she will describe something that happened to her at 12, so you know that she survivd it and was able to move on.) Another aspect was just how sharp Karr's memory is.  She seems to remember every nod of the head, every peanut shucking, until I really started to doubt the credibility of this story. Hampered by that is the fact that later on she describes the scene in Psycho when Norman swivels around in his mother's rocker and is dressed like her. As anybody who has seen Psycho knows... that is NOT how the famous scene goes.  It's awfully hard to believe that Karr can remember all these moments from her childhood, but not the pivotal scene in one of the most famous films of all time. (She also later calls Elizabeth Taylors horse in &quot;National Velvet&quot;, National Velvet.  Velvet was Liz's character, the horse's name was Pi or Pye or Pie.) I also felt at times that Karr uses her unsuspecting readers as her therapist. Why else the rather disturbing depictions of sexual abuse.  The first one is bad enough, but the second scene later on borders between abuse and pornography.  It's disturbingly exact, and makes one feel like they will retch. However, Karr has a helpful habit of starting a section with a little glimpse of what's to come. (i.e, that was the night mom decided to shoot her husband) and then gets around to describing it.  Granted, I am paraphrasing , but this thesis statement will work for those who don't want to read certain sections. I won't say anymore, but I do know that I am in no mood to run out and read &quot;Cherry.&quot; This book was a good idea, but it never jells, and never lets the reader connect with the characters, mainly because we are so busy trying to figure out if it's real or fiction.ly because we are so busy trying to figure out if it's real or fiction.	2001-03-13

I am not sure that I will be able to say anything too new or innovative, but I will say that this book is extremely well written, and very suspenseful.  Tartt creates some extremely memorable characters.  Tartt also nails her depiction of New England... the way it's described, one doesn't even need to visit it. But you may just want to after reading this...<br />Of note is the way that Tartt creates a mood, and enough tension to have your knuckles turn white from holding the book too tightly.  It's a testament to Tartt's narrative skill that I stayed awake on the train both to and from work while I was involved in this book.  So why 4 stars? I do feel that this book tends to run on a little bit too long.  Once we feel the main action has been achieved, we have another 100 pages to deal with even more unraveling.  It gets to be a bit much, and if Tartt had ended her story a little earlier, it would have made a tighter novel overall.  However, the rest of this book is tightly and wonderfully written.	2001-02-23

This book was lying on the floor, I picked it up, opened it, and was instantly hooked.  To say too much about thsi book would give away a tightly coiled plot that unravels (like the narrator's life)in a very satisfactory way.  It's hilarious (wait until you find out what's in his car trunk) and even a bit sad at times.  It's a good look at the cutthroat world of academia as well.  The ending I found to be a bit too pat and tidy, as if Chabon wrapped it up very quickly (or had an editor who told him to), but all in all, Chabon is a wonderful writer and this is a great addition to his canon. The book is so well written that before you know it, you've read 100 pages and the book is almost over. Highly recommended.	2001-02-20

Indeed, if you were a fan of DC in the 80's, you would have seen that this story was brewing at least since 1982 in The New Teen Titans issue # 20 or 21 (the issue that opens with Starfire and Raven saving a baseball stadium from a bomb)and the actual Crisis didn't occur until 1985.  Secret Wars was actually Marvel's attempt to cash in FIRST.. a year earlier.  Read the two miniseries again, and then see which was the more innovative, interesting and better drawn. No contest there.<br />But enough about that, I just wanted to clear up that little bit of misinformation.  This book (and from hereon in will discuss the books) is a gerat collectors item.  The entire crisis is here, in wonderfully restored colors.  Also a bonus is the commentary from the people who were involved in the whole story at the time.  It's always interesting to hear a reminiscence so many years after the fact.  As for the fact that this story may have ruined the DC Universe and spun off way too many series that attempted to clean up the fray, well, this may be true as well... but accept this for what it is, the reprinting of a great story in an improved format.

However, if I didn't happen to work in New York (can't afford to live here though), I would probably get really tired of the endless detailed walking tours of the main character.  Street after street, number after number ... after a while, I wanted to say, &quot;I get the point.. he wanders aimlessly...&quot;<br />I enjoyed this book at first, because I enjoyed the charatcer and his situation.  However, as the novel wore on (at times, it appeared to be a bottomless novel.. the more I read, the more there was left to be read...)I grew tired of the endless situations our &quot;hero&quot; fell into... many of them of his own devising.  You just sit there reading knowing that he can't possibly get out of this situation (in part owing to the &quot;give it away&quot; title).  Also, while the book starts out promisingly, we fall into situations like &quot;needs to pose as a gay guy to rent a great apartment of a film director, but sexy girlfriend of said director lives there also, which is why he needs to pose as a gay guy...&quot; I could see the inevitable coming a mile away.  I also found it difficult to accept such cartoonish and contrived situations as &quot;intellectual best friend dates leathery flatulent 2 dimensional hag&quot;.  It just ends up being cartoonish, unfunny and untrue.  In fact, I am not sure what to make of any of the depictions of women in this novel. Not exactly a very positive outlook.<br />I would not hesitate to read any more books by this author, but I find this effort a little forced, and delivering a little less than promised.	2000-12-26

I think this book ages rather well, and it's an interesting look at the growth and development of the country.  Some may see this book as being &quot;anti-development&quot;, but it's hard not to sympathize with the house as the landscape around her changes and becomes less familiar.<br />My last thought is that I hope when I do have nephews and nieces that there still will be countrysides like the ones depicted in this book.	2000-12-19

I read this entire book in about a day... it's easy when the author conveniently supplies us with bite sized chapters, perfect for this modern world! Who wants to be bogged down in depth, or character development? We want a world of red herrings galore, and cardboard characters.<br />That much I can actually deal with.  What bothered me in this book was Patterson's rather disturbing juxtaposition of descriptions of well muscled, and flawless bodies (male and female) against the background of hideous violence. (The scene with the snake was completely uncalled for).  Patterson almost seems to be at awe of the villains well muscled physique and *ahem* other body parts...he certainly writes enough about it.  But the idea of these women being paraded around in lavish evening gowns in front of their sick captor is just absurd. And honestly, our heroine may be strong, but how many times can she be victimized and beaten and STILL live?<br />This book is a disturbing look at violence against women,made even more disturbing by the needless eroticism of the violence.  This is just rather irresponsible.  And set as it is against the flat, unimaginative prose, &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; adds up to a book that you need to take a shower after reading.	2000-12-18

His classmates are not all model perfect, his clothes don't come from the Gap. In fact, Harry lives in a world of danger, and excitement, and that is so much more fun. Being 29, I thought I would be briefly amused by these Harry Potter books and then move on.<br />Instead, I am a huge Harry convert and have honestly not been this excited about a series of books in a long time. Not only has Rowling brought back the joy of reading, but she has breathed new life in children's fantasy. As a former student in library school, i know full well what will be the popular books for years to come, and deservedly so. For those of you willing to pooh pooh these books and relegate them to the children's bin, open these books up and read them. We hear that kids have all the fun..well, hee's your second chance! Long live Harry and Hogswarts! I especially liked the introduction of the Dementors in this book, fearsome beings that can suck all the happiness out fo you.  These are among Rowlings most terrifying creations.  The rest of the gang is here as well, getting themselves into more trouble than ever.<br />The only bad thing is the wait until the 5th book comes out! Hurry JK, hurry!	2000-12-18

Books	5	13	13	N	N	an extremely fun book for everyone	I picked up this book in a bookstore, and was laughing out loud as I read through it.  On the one hand, this is actually a fun way to teach children proper behavior when it's time for them to go to bed, and it's a clever use of dinosaurs (kids favorite) to get the point across.  On the other hand, the illustrations and text are humorous and also quite accurate.  Kids will see themselves in these pictures, relate to how it feels to have to go to bed when they don't want to.  Adults will just smile and laugh because the drawings really ARE that funny.  I never expected in my life to see a dinosaur throwing a temper tantrum, but now that I have, I wonder why it took me so long. This is a great book, and I foresee it being one that kids will want to have read to them over and over again.  And I think adults will have no problem in doing so.	2000-12-18

NOTE: This is in no way encouraging any criticism of Pullman. His books are simply wonderful.<br />I feel badly that Rowling has taken such heat for a series that continues to astound.  With each book, the world she has created comes together in a much more cohesive fashion.  Book 4 is notable not only for its innovations and adventure (it's a bold move on Rowling's part to have an entire school year with no Quidditch matches, at the same time, it makes sense and keeps us from getting tired of repetition.) Another high point is that Rowling develops her stories, and adds secondary characters from the other books to help the story move forward.  Did you think you'd seen the end of the house elves,Sirius Black, Moaning Myrtle or the Dementors? Guess again.  Rowling uses them in this book in interesting ways.  By doing this, Rowling also makes each book an essential part of the whole, and every sign is pointing us forward to book 5.<br />Another strong point of the book is the return of all of our favorite characters, and the newest developments.  Is there some kind of romantic tension between Ron and Hermione? Perish the thought, but Rowling skillfully doles out soap opera, humor, and horror and balances it very carefully.  Rowling also doesn;t spare her magic characters either.  For the past three books, we kind of were split along the &quot;magic good, muggles bad&quot; lines... this is fine,except every reader of the book (including Rowling)is a Muggle. At times, it almost became embarrassing to see non-magical characters seen as lumpish, dumb and slovenly.  In this book, we see that all the magical beings are not so perfect and pure either, most notably in a rather disturbing scene at the World Quidditch Cup matches where Muggles are hapless victims of a cruel prank. This is good as it begins to erase the rather polarized lines that Rowling had developed, and allows us to question our own black and white beliefs (i.e., not every oppressed group reacts to oppression in a noble fashion.)  Rowling also gives us the sense of political awakening in Hermione, as she sees the injustice in the situation of the house elves.  I am interested to see this situation explored more in other novels.<br />This book is, so far, the darkest of the lot.  But Harry bravely faces these challenges (including an exciting and darkly terrifying climax.) But don't let that dissuade you from reading this 4th book.  The only real complaint is that Rowling is hinting that she may wait 2 years to release the next book.  I hardly find this fair, as the first three books were released all in the span of one year.  2 years is too long of a wait, and I think a bit unfair to her loyal readers.  But, we'll see. In the meantime, I may just begin to read the series over again to kill time until the next book.  I suspect I am not the first person to do that either.ess victims of a cruel prank.

Most of the points were resolved and tied up, and had she never written another book on the vampires, we would still have had a lot of questions, but at least there would have been some resolution.  In my opinion, this book falters slightly from the first two books of the Vampire Chronicles.  Part of that reason is that Rice splits this novel into several different narrative points of view, whereas in the first 2 books, we had one consistent narrator.  Another reason is that this book has a more \\"cartoonish\\" feel than the first two books.  All the vampires gathered around together reminded me too much of the \\"Super Friends\\" Saturday morning cartoon when I was a kid.  There, as in \\"Queen of the Damned\\", we had all our favorite characters assembled under one roof to face a common foe.  And then I felt that the climax of the book was just a bit too rushed.  You spend an entire novel waiting for a cataclysmic event, and when it occurs, I thought, \\"That's it?\\"<br />However, this book is still an enjoyable read. There is the usual amount of mystery and terror that the reader wants to see, and Rice keeps us involved even when the plot starts to go off into strange areas... vampire bars anyone? Rice delves once more into the ancient Egyptian mythology that made the previous book, \\"The Vampire Lestat\\", so intriguing. Most of this novel is set in the present day (or at least what was the present day... mid-1980's).  This book also introduces the reader to new characters who become more involved in the Vampire Chronicles later on.<br />Rice also creates one of her most fascinating villains with the character of Akasha, the Queen of the Damned.  It is she who controls the fate of the vampires, and my only regret is that we didn't get to see enough of her thoughts and her story.  Rice really outdid herself with the Queen, and in doing so, makes for another great read.so, makes for another great read.	2000-12-14

Opening in 1985, we read that Lestat is now a \\"rock and roll\\" star.  (Note to Anne Rice:  people have not said \\"rock and roll\\" for quite some time...)  This seems a strange change for the brooding vampire of the first book, and it's not entirely successful to me as a reader.  It may have worked better in 1985, but by now, it seems a bit unnecessary and kind of silly.  Thankfully, this plot is only a framing device for the life story of Lestat de Lioncourt (and that's why I insist on giving this book 5 stars.) \\"Lestat\\" is quite a different novel from the first in the series, but we are dealing with an entirely different vampire here than the depressed and vulnerable Louis (who remains my favorite vampire). Lestat's story goes throughout the centuries, and he meets other vampire's who tell their tales.  This book is a fantastic pageant that goes back to Ancient Egyptian times, to classical Rome, to pagan Europe, to the times of the French Revolution, to an old, decaying Parisian cemetery and even up to the present time.  \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" is a much denser novel than the first (which has now become a sort of prelude or teaser to the entire Vampire Chronicles) but it's just as enjoyable.  This book seems to be the hands down favorite of most readers of the Vampire Chronicles, but this is not an incentive to read these books out of order. \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" contains some very important passages and character development that are important to your understand of the second (especially in one of the final sections of \\"Lestat\\"). Amazingly, Rice maintains the continuity between the two novels, and doesn't make any of the \\"revisionist history\\" in the second seem false or forced. (Of note is the explanation as to why Lestat's father but not mother was in the first book... that revelation is a shocking one.) Another fun aspect is Lestat's reaction to reading Stoker's \\"Dracula\\". And fear not, some of our favorite characters from the first book do appear again... in unexpected ways.  One of my favorite characters to be introduced into this book was Akasha, who is the Queen of the Damned of the third novel.<br />With The Vampire Lestat, Rice again does a wonderful job with her prose; it's a beautifully written, exciting and captivating book. I had no idea where the book was going from one moment to the next, and it never disappointed.  Rice even successfully depicts twentieth century America as a fascinating place to be.  I never thought a drugstore would seem so interesting. Read this book, but don't read it too fast... savor it, it's worth the time.action to reading Stoker's \\"Dracula\\".

We have steam heat in my apartment, so I had the window open to get in some fresh air.  The wind coming into the room caused my bedroom door to rattle on its hinges.  I could not have asked for a better atmosphere in which to read this book.<br />This is a great book to start off with if you love a good vampire tale.  (But we know it's not the first.) Stoker writes an extremely effective and scary tale.  The opening sequences with Jonathan Harker meeting the superstitious villagers, and then his ordeal in the Castle are effectively scary, great mood setters and some of the best horror writing I have ever encountered.  Unfortunately, the book begins to flag a bit in the middle with endless meetings between Van Helsing and his cohorts. After a while I just wished they'd do something, and not just sit around talking about it.  The book also left a few questions for me: how did Harker escape the castle, why did Quincey Morris hide in the shadow of a tree, and why was Renfield chosen to be the servant of the vampire? These are minor quibbles, and they effectively add to the intrigue. I also enjoyed the character of Mina finding some strength at the end, as too much of the book has her being the predictable Victorian heroine. (Yes, she indeed faints.)<br />I think this is also a good book to be read BEFORE you pick up any Anne Rice.  Rice perfectly carries on the tradition of the vampire novel, and this serves as a great \\"prologue\\" (for Rice debunks a lot of vampire myths in her books, and even has Lestat muse on the \\"truth\\" in Stoker's novel... but this in no way renders \\"Dracula\\" irrelevant.)<br />Dracula is thrilling, racy (for its time... those three vampire women must have shocked the Victorian audiences right down to their lace collars), and a great read.	2000-12-13

This is actually a continuation and not a sequel, and it's a darn good one at that.  When we last left Lyra, she was entering a new world thanks to her father, Lord Asriel. Now... we start the story with Will, who is an inhabitant of our Earth.  To say too much about the plot of this story would give too many things away.  But needless to say, this is very much its own story.  Some familiar characters from the first book do not appear, other smaller characters are given much more depth.  We also get the excitement of new dangers and a breathtaking final page that is horifying, yet compelling.<br />I think what Pullman does best in these books is to heighten the sense of danger and terror without resorting to a large amount of bloodletting.  The terror is so palpable, that just the idea of it is enough (such as the extremely unsettling scene when a group of fleeing adults are attacked by a bunch of wraithlike creatures who steal their souls.) It's a nice change of pace from this world of violent movies.  Pullman shows us horror and death, yet does it in such a masterful way that we feel all of the pain and anguish and see very little of the gore.<br />I am stumped as to which way the series will go from here.  The Subtle Knife is indeed a continuation of The Golden Compass, and I wouldn't suggest reading this out of order, but Pullman does what very few writers dare: he creates an entirely new world, and new story directions that take the reader to even higher plateaus.  Plus, he keeps us guessing, and that is the most fun of all.	2000-12-13

I found it extremely hard to relate to any of these guys, and didn't find any of their lives extremely interesting.  I would hope that not too many young people just coming out really expect life to be like this. Every guy in this book is a beautiful, musclebound man who hops in and out of bed with different partners. *Yawn*  The subplot with the mother and son (just coming out... and also a fabulous stripper) dating the same guy seems either ripped off or an homage to Gordon Merrick. Either way, it doesn't really work.  The guy they both lust after is a creep of the highest degree.  If the quality of the writing on this book were perhaps a bit higher, this plot may have been pulled off.  Instead, this is a lifeless, dull and rather unsexy book that has not inspired me to check out any other books by this writer.	2000-12-12

I could say a thousand more things about this book, but I am sure most reviewers here at amazon have already aired similar sentiments.  This book was my big find of late 1999.<br />From the great first paragraph, to the end of the book, Dolores Price's life and tribulations amuse, horrify, depress, move and ultimately enlighten us. (And it never bores us).  I read this book on a whim.  I rarely watch Oprah, but was curious as to the huge response this book received when it was chosen as her first book of the month.  For the next week, I was completely hooked.  And yes I, like so many others, was very surprised that a book written by a man about a woman could be this realistic and this authentic.  Another admirable feature of this book is that lamb does not allow Delores to grow whiny and complaining.  She presents her life as it happened to her, and she does not spare even herself when she talks about the down and the dirty aspects of her life.  In the end, we realize that Delores is a remarkable person, not because she has done anything special, or become a hero to millions (she hasn't) but because we identify with her and realize that every person has their own story to tell.  It sounds corny to say that, but you'll understand once you read this (and I hope you will).	2000-12-12

I think that the problem many people have with novels featuring young female protagonists is that people seem to think that they are only for young females.  It's too bad, ebcause there are so many enjoyable books out there that can reach al types of people. Anne of Green Gables is one of them.  Not only is Anne a fun character (is she ever!), but also Montgomery's descriptions of Prince Edward Island are so vivid that you want to be right alongside Anne.<br />My mother is an elementary school teacher, and reads this book to her class every year, and they all enjoy it. Despite the fact that this book is almost a century old, it has lost none of its charm, none of its fun.  One of my favorite scenes deals with Anne and her best friend jumping on top of a bed where, unbeknownst to them, her friend's spinster aunt is already asleep.  It's moments like that that make the reader laugh out loud.  And the best part is, this book does not become cloying.  Anne is no goody two shoes, and we all know that imperfect young children who get into trouble (whether they mean to or not) are always preferable to the &quot;please and thank you&quot; children (whom not many of us can relate to).<br />I don't think I read a more enjoyable, lighthearted and fresh young persons novel this past year.

The Jane Eyre of the novel is a spirited young woman, who yearns to be able to experience life despite the limitations society has placed upon women.  This book is a wonderful read.  Bronte's 19th century England is not the neo-classical world of manners and balls that permeate Jane Austin's universe; rather, the world of Jane Eyre one of ragged romanticism that plays out against the harsh elements, and the world seems as primitive indoors as it does outside. Bronte writes in a very lucid, revelatory style, and the first person narrative does a lot to help draw you into this story.  Even if you know the secret in the attic, there is so much more about this novel that you may not know about.<br />The biggest surprise about this novel once I read it was that Jane's story does not end with the revelation of Rochester's dark gothic secret (even though this was written several years after Austen's Northanger Abbey, it's fun to read the two books in conjunction). I am surprised that most film and stage versions of this novel rarely include the important last third of the book. But I'll let you discover the developments to Jane's character on your own.  The ending is a tear-jerker (but in a great way).  This is definitely the book to read on the front porch of a summer cottage, or in front of a fire on a winter night. Mystery, romance, intrigue, religion, and feminism... it's all in here. And it's worth the read.	2000-12-12

Around the woman's neck is a large necklace that nobody is allowed to touch.  There are three old aunts taking care of her.  In the backyard is an old tree with the cryptic word, \\"Lasher\\" inscribed into it. Nearby is a decaying swimming pool, left over from the grandeur of the twenties when it was once filled with champagne. And above all, there is a brown haired man who appears and disappears at random.<br />These images form the most powerful opening chapter of any of Rice's novels.  How can one NOT be hooked with the level of writing and eerie atmosphere that saturate these opening pages? Welcome to the witching hour.<br />It's been said that \\"King Lear\\" is Shakespeare's GREATEST work, but not his BEST. The same can be said of The Witching Hour.  This book is a 1000 page plus magnum opus of witches, sex, ghosts and scandal...in other words, &quot;As the Witch Turns&quot;. In the end, it delivers a little less than I had hoped it would, but this is by no means dismissing this novel. It is the writing style that distinguishes this novel. T This book has any number of richly written, satisfying moments. The 17th century burning of a witch at the stake in a French town, the deadly Christmas Eve birth, the history of the ghost in the house... these are all some of the best scenes Rice has ever written.  There are some complaints that the story takes too much time to develop, and the over 400 page family history is a distraction, but it is essential to the plot.<br />There are two sequels (so far) to this novel, but neither one comes close to the hypnotic charm of this novel. It will keep you awake long into the night wondering what will happen next...probably even into the witching hour itself. Enjoy.	2000-12-12

People may have objections to the sex and to the drug use, (and the girl with the see through dress), but at its heart, this book in NO way glamorizes drug use. Must we put a moral thermometer on everything? This is just a book about two young kids who run away from home and get caught up in the English world of squatters and heroin. I like how this book shows that not all squatters are a bunch of junkies.  In fact, many of the squatters try and stop our \\"heroes\\" from getting involved with the wrong crowd.  The squatters form a type of family, and drugs tear them apart in the end.<br />There has been a lot of controversy about this book, and whether or not it has a place in the classroom.  (Some of this has been around whether a child should just READ this book on their own time.)  I say the more who read it, the better.

This comes through in his new book as well. I am sure many may see the subject of the book and be turned off, but instead, this book is an absorbing read on the growth of a writer, and the techniques that he uses. The first half of the book is mainly autobiographical: what inspired King, what his experiences were as a kid.  It's a great glimpse into his mind.  I like that King takes himself to our level, that he has a healthy amount of humility AND he is willing to admit that not all of his books were perefct unto themselves.<br />The ending of the book is a description of his June 1999 accident.  It's fitting for King to end the book on this note, because it showed him (and us) just how important writing is to his life, and to his recovery.  I enjoyed this little excursion out of King's fictional haunts. Since King is such an accomplished writer as it is, it doesn't seem like all that much of a trangression either, just another entertainign read by a great author.	2000-12-12

I suppose I should have since the main character cries an unusual amount (that should have been my first clue) throughout the story.<br />This book seems to speak to a lot of people since it has become such a big underground hit. I like the fact that subjects such as homosexuality and abortion are discussed, but there is no real moral judgment made by the narrator.<br />This book has a great cast of characters, from the older sister, to the parents (who, bless Chbosky's soul, are REAL people and not cardboard cutouts), to his best friends at school.  This book seems to really have its finger on the pulse of today, and I think most people who read it would enjoy it.<br />Now that I have said my piece, go and read this novel. :)	2000-12-12
US	51304688	RD104RU4BJ2GO	0553211978	569473707	Northanger Abbey (Bantam Classic)	Books	5	21	24	N	N	Hysterically funny... a wonderful debut novel	While this was one of the last Jane Austen novels published, it was the first one to be written. I read this book before I was familiar with the conventions of the Gothic novel, but this book is a worthy send up of all of those conventions.  Even if you are not especially familiar with the works of Anne Radcliffe or Monk Lewis, this novel is worth your time.  The opening three pages which describe why Catherine Morland really isn't the heroine type are as funny as anything you'd read today.  Other great passages are when Austen defends the reading of fiction in a passionate aside, and when Catherine becomes convinced that General Tilney is keeping his wife locked up in the dungeon of Northanger Abbey.<br />In this book, we have the beginnings of Jane's devastating wit as she tears apart society.  We also have the benefit of some witty one liners, flighty characters and hilarious situations. (Of special note is the fact that it would seem that college men have ALWAYS been drinking and swearing type guys... although Austen discretely blanks out the 'dirty' words so as not to offend her readers.)<br />I used to rush home from work to read this book, and was not disappointed in it at all, from beginning to end. This is the best place to start with Austen (well, you could also read her juvenilia if you want... it is more silly than anything, but entertaining nonetheless), and it's definitely a fun read.	2000-12-11

I think some of the most fun in this book are the really backwards &quot;girls comics&quot; of the 50's that dealt morality on a black/white basis.  It is fascinating to see the metamorphosis of the comics as they coincide with the women's movement, and the restrictions of femininity are broken. Trina Robbins is also one of the best people to write this book as she has been an illustrator for many years.<br />One of the best selling points of this book is that it is in full color, on glossy paper.  You are definitely getting your money's worth with this book.  Enjoy.	2000-12-11

I only discovered Olivia just this afternoon while I was browsing at the local bookstore.  Olivia reminds one of Elopise, but at the same time, it's nice to see her with parents and siblings.  I was enchanted by this book, I laughed out loud, and darn it all... if I had only had a few bucks more, I would have bought it. The prose is simple, but sharp and direct, and the artwork is hysterical (especially when Olivia's brother is shown copying everything she does.)<br />Even more fun is Olivia's appreciation for art and the like.  Imagine a little kid wanting a Callas picture book read to them. It's touches like this that make Olivia the clear winner as one of the best picture books to emerge this past year. I am hoping Falconer will write a few more books about this precious piglet.  In the meantime, be proud to buy a copy of this book for yourself, even if you don't have any kids.  It will definitely be the literary high point of your week.	2000-12-09

The writing is vivid, and the snowbound setting makes this story very streamlined.  I started with Over Sea, Under Stone, and while I found it enjoyable, this second book enthralled me.  I would recommend reading this book second (as it is listed in the natural order) because it starts to slowly reveal things that make more sense later on.  The first book is just to whet your appetite, this book adds the kicker. The sense of menace and dread is excellent.  I wish this book had ben longer so that I could have enjoyed it even more.  Definitely worth your time.	2000-12-08

It was the Fall of 1990 and the class was &quot;Landscape and Literature&quot;. (And the professor was Martha Ackman, and she was great!) It was an interesting class, but I really enjoyed the reading material.  At this point, Bean Trees had been around for a couple of years, but I had never heard of it, nor had I heard of Barbara Kingsolver.  This novel was so absorbing, I didn't feel it was an assignment at all. I spent a great, warm October weekend sitting on my parents porch and reading this book.<br />I also think that this book has one of the best opening paragraphs in contemporary fiction.  I won't give it away, but do yourself a favor and look for it at any bookstore.  This novel is funny, sad, and touching. It was my introduction to Kingsolver, and I am glad I got a head start on her before many others did.  This is a book that you'll ant to hold onto, to give to friends, to discuss...<br />Taylor Greer is one of the most engaging heroines in literature, and her unconventional story is infused with a real contemporary feel. What does that mean? I just mean that Kingsolver disucsses issues and people that many authors don't in popular american fiction (native american issues, central american politics, refugees, mixed marriages and Protestantism and catholicism all merge in one novel), and as a result, Kingsolver holds up a mirror of our world where we can see ourselves and society much clearer than before. I know that I sure did.  Ten years later, I still can remember this book so vividly, it's never left me.	2000-12-08

I've no idea what even made me pick it up as I had no real idea what this story was about, or about the author, or even anything about young adult lit at that point. A week later I was trying to get every person I knew to read it.  Now it's your turn dear reader...<br />This book is not only laugh out loud funny, but it's a very interesting depiction of the Middle Ages. Is it truthful? Well, Cushman has done her research, and this truly does seem authentic.  Many people I have chatted with wonder if young women at the time really would have been so spirited as catherine.  Hey..who's to say? None of us were there, and I am sure there were young women even then who yearned for more out of life than marriage (which was more like slavery... the concept of marriage for love was still an od topic)... Thanks to this great book (suitable and enjoyable enough for adults and young adults alike), now we have one.	2000-12-06

So much for Victorian attitudes... Sybylla rages against her parents, shuns marriage in favor of a career, sees classism and injustice as it truly is, and at one point questions the exuistence of God.  The result is an entertaining story. Sybylla is a worthy literary sister to Anne of Green Gables, or the March sisters. The story has a little less of the innocence to it, but all of the charm.  The description of 1890's Australia are vivid, as are all the people Sybylla meets (and those great Australian geographic names.)<br />Try and find a copy of this book... and then demand it go back into print!  You won't regret reading this, and you'll enjoy it wholeheartedly. (Beware, My career Goes Bung is not a &quot;true&quot; sequel, and can easily be skipped without missing anything.)	2000-12-06

I did.. it takes place in the general Western Massachusetts area, near a reservoir I assume is based on the famous Quabbin (the reservoir that replaced towns... the very same one as in the film, &quot;In Dreams&quot;). Unfortunately, I found this book tended to fall a bitflat. I almost feel guilty for giving it just a fair rating, but there were just some things about the book I just didn't like.<br />-Anderson doesn't use a lot of contractions, and thus the dialogue sounds oddly stilted, especially when you consider it's teens talking.<br />-Though this book was published in 1997, it would seem as if it had been sitting around a while, or else Anderson has no idea what contemporary teens are like.  He rather unfairly stereotypes several background characters as speaking like the great Valley Girl craze of the 80's.  In fact, this book almost seems like it's from the 80's.<br />-At the end, we are suddenly given a second point of view of the vampires,and how they too are oppressed and murdered through hatred.  By then, it's far too late.  We had just spent the past couple hundred pages witnessing vampires eating flesh and people (most notably in one of the most stomach churning scenes at a vampire church banquet), as well as hearing reports of innocents being slaughtered AND knowing that the vampires worship an evil demon lord.  This is hardly the point in the book to try and gain our sympathy, it's just too late.<br />This is not to say the author lacks potential.  Anderson looks to be a very exciting talent, and I do own a copy of Burger Wuss that I am looking forward to reading.  The imagination and the story are here, but the execution was a bit flawed, and I never felt drawn into the book or a part of the action. I just felt like I was watching everything happen through a smudged and dirty window.	2000-12-01

He is not gay after all.<br />That said, I would highly recommend this book.  Maguire is an intensely gifted writer (I remember realizing that Wicked is not a book to be read lightly, rather, a book that could be taught to a college class.)  This book is a surprisingly fast read... once you get into it, it's hard to put it down. Maguire's style in this story is a gritty, no frills true story of the Cinderella. One actually does not miss the lack of mice, and pumpkins, and fairy godmothers as the real story is so enticing. Plus.. the ending packs a wallop that you don't expect.  The historical background involving the tulip trade and the changing society of the Netherlands is interesting, but also integral to the tale. After you read this, you'll have an entirely new perspective on the fairy story on which it is based. I gave it only 4 stars because of a personal bias that I could have used a few more explanations, and the ending seemed rushed, but otehrwise, this is a great tale.	2000-11-30

Unfortunately, this book is not as enjoyable as the previous three.  The usual dark humor and assorted characters are there, but things just don't gel like they do in his author books.  Part of the quirky charm of Disch is how far his stories will go: major characters die bizarre deaths, coincidence is heaped upon coincidence, the supernatural tends to have a wry sense of humor.  In this book though, there seems to be too much unexplained by the end.  And the main character, the sub herself, is a rather unsympathetic character from the beginning.  Even the Priest allowed one have some level of sympathy for the character, even though we were well aware that his crimes were an abomination, and he did deserve punishment. One doesn't feel that here.  Indeed, we never get to the root of the tale exactly, and by the time we are done, there is still too much left in our minds.  Disch often does this but again this time, it doesn't work.  It's too bad, I came to this book with a high off of &quot;The Priest&quot; and could not wait to read his latest.  Why two stars? Because Disch himself is so talented, and has such a wonderful way of writing that to only reward him one or no stars would ignore the fact that the man can write.	2000-11-29

That must be a double edged sword for her, because there is so much more to her than one novel, and it would be a shame to overlook any of them. At the same time, this is a wonderful way to become acquainted with Alice Walker.  I first read the book in 1986, right when the movie was peaking. I was 14, and had already experienced &quot;adult&quot; themes in novels..I had read Jean Auel's books a few months earlier.  At the time, I was so young that while a lot of the novel didn't go over my head, I didn't appreciate it as much.  Half of my life later, almost to the day, I reread the novel again.  This time, the experience was that much richer. This is a great novel, and a great tale about self acceptance and healing, and love.  The best part is that Celie does not become a beautiful princess at the end, she just stays  Celie, and that's the best part (and biggest truth) of all. Read this and enjoy it.  It's worth the read.	2000-11-29

The artwork is a direct homage to the simple stylings of WW Denslows original illustrations (as compared to the very complex John O'Neill art nouveau drawings in the later books.) Robert Sabuda is a genius, and deserves much praise for his wonderful work here.  I show it to everybody who stops by, like a little kid.  This book just does something to me, but see for yourself..buy it, and you may also be like me, and considering buying a second copy to keep and one to display...  I hope to see much more of Sabuda's work in the future.	2000-11-29

Unfortunately, many people now look down on Rice as a &quot;preternatural&quot; (Rice sure does love that word)Danielle Steele.  This is due, no doubt, to the fact that Rice's output since then has been rather rushed.(one or two books a year... and usually the same narrative structure of somebody recounting their tale to another). Perhaps Rice's work has been marred by her prolificness (is that even a word).  Rice lost me with Taltos and Memnoch the Devil when it didn't even seem like she gave much thought to her stories anymore.  But this first book is a tremendous achievement on a par with (yes, I am going there) Bram Stokers Count.  It's wonderful, exciting, and engrossing.  If all her books go out of print, this and 1990's &quot;The Witching Hour&quot; deserve to be sold forever.  I would also recommend the first two sequels to this novel: The Vampire Lestat (which is far and away the favorite of the series)and The queen of the Damned (another place that Rice could have stopped her series). But not one of her novels has touched me as emotionally as her first.  I can rememeber waiting to come home and read it every night (and yes, i *do* have a life too..) Written in a beautiful style, &quot;Interview&quot; only proves that Anne Rice herself is the true queen of the damned.  Now if only she'd write another great one..it's been long overdue.	2000-11-29

This book has great pictures, and covers the entire history of the show from 1956-1996.  That's a lot of twins, kidnappings, murders, and family drama.  What comes through best about this book is its sense of history.

But I never did because I just assumed it would be boring.  Three years later, I tried it again... and I kicked myself for not having tried it sooner.<br />I think my vision of reading Jane Austen always has me curled up in a chair while it's snowing outside, but in truth, the real memory of reading this book was sitting in the waiting room of a car mechanic while my car was being worked on.  That day stands out because as usual, the mechanics only had the usual things to read: &quot;Guns and Ammo&quot; and &quot;Field and Stream&quot;.  Add the requisite gumball machine in the corner with stale gumballs and you have the idea.  I brought the book with me to read, but didn't really think I would get all that much reading of it done.  True, I was reading it for fun, but it was Jane Austen after all, and I wasn't sure if I could really concentrate on her.  Well, 200 pages later, bringing that novel with me was the best decision I ever made.  4 years later, I still rememebr how into this book I got.  (I even had to take a walk around the block before I read the last chapter just to prolong finishing the story.)  Once the story did end, I felt like I was saying goodbye to my friends.<br />This book is riveting, it's fun, it's hysterical (wait for the rewarding confrontation between Lady Catherine deBourgh and Elizabeth...it's not only a battle of tongues, but a great clash of the &quot;refined&quot; yet uneducated upper classes, and the middle classes of Regentry England.  This is by far my favorite Austen novel of the bunch (with Emma coming in a close second).  So, this winter, wait for a snowy day (heck, choose any day, you can't have a bad Austen day) and get ready to be taken away.  And no.. this book is not solely the domain of high school etachers and academians.. you'll be surprised how much you may enjoy it.	2000-11-16

Anyhow, classifying and cataloguing is a big part of what we do.  Unfortunately, when it comes to this novel, people seemd to content to only classify it as gay fiction, and that is where I found it in my local ..., in the gay fiction section.  This is such a tragedy to me as this novel is about so much more.  In fact, the homosexuality is only a small (albeit important) part of one of the most entertaining and well written &quot;bildungsromans&quot; that I have read in a long while.  Selvadurai deftly describes his childhood within a well to do Sri Lankan family, and the devastation that the political upheavals (between the Sinhalese and the Tamils) made on his life.  This book describes the horrors visited upon his family (the fate of the grandparents is too horrible to even try and contemplate)while the narrator comes to consciousness in many ways.<br />I went from being heartily amused in the first chapter about children playing (so, so funny,..and so relatable to anybody who was ever terrorized by a tyrannical fat cousin)to being deeply saddened by the end of the novel, when Sri Lanka is no longer his idyllic home, but rather a place of danger  that he and his family must escape.  I do not hesitate in giving this novel five stars (despite the fact that it is very episodic) because it is  so well written.  Selvadurai is a huge talent, and I have Cinnamon Gardens waiting to be read at home.<br />I urge everybody to read this book, even if you aren't comfortable enough going to the previously unexplored &quot;gay fiction&quot; section.  Books like this are an increasingly rare breed, so we may as well search thenm out while we can.	2000-11-16

Not only is it informative, but it's funny, it's light, and it has great artwork.  I think the thing about this book that appeals to me the most is how is shows that &quot;femininity&quot; and the rigid reinforcement of can often lead to ridiculous things (such as Victorian fashion).  I especially like the ending of this book because it shows that while Amelia Bloomer eventually stopped wearing her bloomers, she triumphed after all.

Up until then, I had been too nervous to see it, as stories of demonic posession always tended to creep me out and give me plenty of sleepless nights.  I finally did see it, and I loved it.  Naturally, I had to read the book.  I think that one of the most extraordinary things about the movie and the book are the facets that tend to get overlooked when somebody discusses them, preferring instead to focus on unnatural sex with crucifixes and pea soup.  First and foremost, this story is a moving testament of faith and redemption.  Written as it was during the whole counterculutural era, values were being stood on end.  This book reflects the confusion of Father Karras as he struggles with himself, and his faith, and ultimately comes to know peace through his rigourous ordeal with Pazuzu the demon. The book is even more touching than the film (although to its credit, the film follows the novel very closely), and the final moments with Father Karras being administered the last rites are especially powerful.  Some may see this novel as being &quot;anti-Church&quot;... i see it as just the opposite (but then, you need not trust me, I also do not feel that Boys in the Band is an especially untruthful and bitter depiction of gay life in the 60's).  This book, rather than distancing me from the church, drew me into its mysteries even more, a world where the sacred and the profane exist everywhere. This book skillfully portrays that, and I am grateful that it does.  And yes, it's also full of enough chills to make you stay up at night (albeit gleefully) swearing you've heard a noise in the attic.	2000-11-15

This book has been debated, hated, loved, scorned and everything in between for the last 4 decades.<br />What I will say is, despite Friedan's ratehr hyperbolic description of homosexuality as a &quot;murky smog covering America&quot;, this book is fast, funny, readable, and IMPORTANT.  It opens the sparkling clean refrigerator door of Beaver Cleaver America (which only existed on TV anyhow) and shows us the moldering lettuce sitting in the crisper drawer. I love this book, have bought it for many, many friends, and I can only hope it never goes out of print, and that it inspires everybody for generations to come.

(just kidding)	I am frustrated a little bit by the marketing of these books.  Not only are they in the Young Adult sections, but the cover of the hardcover/trade edition is so bland, you'd think this was a warm fuzzy story about a young girl and her polar bear.  Quite the opposite.  I can't think of any book in the last twenty years that has been more daring, provocative and (in the case of close minded people) relatively controversy free.  With the publication of the third novel in this series, I am sure that it's all going to change.<br />The plot of this novel? To tell too much would give it away.  To narrow it all down, we can say that this is a story of a girl (like Alice or Dorothy) who goes on a wonderful adventure in search of &quot;Dust&quot; Unlike Alice or Dorothy, the terror she faces is on a scale of the final battle between good and evil, and her parents are not left behind to wring their hands and wonder where their daughter is, indeed, they are uncaring individuals responsible for the atrocities that are occurring on Lyra's alternate earth.<br />Suffice it to say that this novel is complex on a scale with Gregory Maguire's &quot;Wicked&quot; (which is classified as an ADULT novel).  The plot twists surprise us, the ambiguities confound us, and by the end of the book, we are even mroe confused than we were at the beginning... that's a good thing, dear reader..a VERY good thing.<br />This is a book that will not only increase in popularity in the coming months, but it is one that is sure to get people talking.  Look for it on the subway, the bus, and on your own coffeetable (where it may have appeared out of the blue... the book is that pervasive.)<br />Enjoy this book, but buyer beware...the cute whimsy of Harry Potter (and compared to this book, it's ALL whimsy and makes the protestors about Potter look even more foolish) is nothing compared to the dark horror in this book that that grips you like a supernatural pair of pliers.  Enjoy.	2000-11-15

NO	This is the high point of the Henry James middle period.  I don't think any book so perfectly captures the spirit of a city than The Bostonians does.  It's obvious that James is critical of the people of Boston, and has great fun with a great era (spirituality, free love, communal living, feminism, and seances in the post-Civil War America), yet at the same time, I think this is a great description (and a truthful one) of the home of the eban and the cod.  The battle between Olive Chancellor and Basil Ransom for the soul of the very confused spiritualist speaker Verena Tarrant (Ah, those Jamesian names again!)is not only powerfully doen, but I think this book has much more humor in it than Portrait of a Lady does. (Although, this does not diminish either work in the least.)  I could speak all day about this book, and given a chance I will.  But I urge you to take a chance on it.  I was Massachusetts born and raised..but out in the Western end of the state, and we tend to feel Bostonians sometimes think a bit too well of themselves. Apparently, over 100 years ago, things were the same.  There is so much more to this book, read it, and realize that we, at the beginning of a new millenium, are hardly as progressive or as innovative as we like to think we are.<br />Of course, the greatest irony of this book comes not within its pages, but when you visit the grave of the James family.  Henry James ashes were interred in the ground on the family plot, and now and forever, the family plot looks not upon the city of New York, or the expanses of Europe, but rather, Henry James, for all eternity, is facing th city of Boston.  e	2000-11-15

Kay Thompson had a lot of personality, but darn it, she wrote a few sentences without punctuation that make Faulkner's Benji's narrative sound lucid, and we heap the praise on her &quot;genius&quot;.  Eloise is not Eloise without Hilary Knight.  The drawings in this book are the reason I bought it (and every subsequent book)and Knight is the reason i continue to adore Eloise.  The New York of Eloise is timeless, and makes all of us want to live in Eloise's world (though I am not sure if I'd want to be Eloise per se... she's a bit of a brat, and has no friends.)  I love these books, and wish there were more of them... and I wish Knight could draw her forever. If only thompson had not scrapped the idea for &quot;Eloise takes a Bawth&quot;, (a 5th book) that would have been wonderful. Long live Eloise, and Hilary Knight!	2000-11-15

I initially bought this book after seeing the Jane Campion film, (which I actually wasn't too crazy about)but I always think it's a good idea to read the source material.  After a few false starts (warning: one needs to devote all their attention to James in order to enjoy him)I finally got into this book, and couldn't put it down.  From the great settings of the novel, to the variety of fascinating characters (the liberated Henrietta Stackpole, the sinister Madame Merle, the beloved Ralph Touchett, Ralph's eccentric mother, the flighty Countess Gemini, the deadly Gilbert Osmond, and of course, Isabel Archer herself... James gives characters great names as well) &quot;Portrait&quot; is a great novel not only of self discovery, but self deception.  How many of us in this world have liked to have thought ourselevs as free to make our own chocies, and were excited by a future full of &quot;possibility&quot; only to allow something (or usually someone) to get in our way and make us realize just how quickly we can lose our freedom and be in a cage that we need to get out of.  (Pardon my bad grammar.) Those of you looking fora Jane Austen type ending, this may not be the book for you, but I think this book is more of a spiritual cousin to Austen than we may think.  It all comes down to making choices, and teh effects of those decisions.  Throw off any reservations that you may have because this book was written over a century ago, it's as fresh, funny, tragic and riveting today as it was then. (And hey, buy the film soundtrack which perfectly captures the mood of the story for accompaniment..that was a plug!)	2000-11-15

This is the book to read, second only to Betty Friedan's Feminine Mystique in terms of relevance and timelessness to the women's movement.  Faludi writes in a wonderful style that does not alientae the reader as many other political texts tend to do (the authors Mary Daly and Camille Paglia coem to mind).  This book is a fast read (despite its heft) and I found myself unable to sleep at night, it was that hard to put down.  Faludi provides a very balanced, well researched study of the the backlash of the 1980's against women. Scoff if you want, but read this book before you do. (Then you are free to scoff all you want.)  On top of the great writing, Faludi interjects this book with enough humor and offhanded comments that make this book hard to dislike. (And I love it.)<br />Even if you're not a believer in the women's movement, this book should be read nonetheless if you really want to know what women are fighting for. This book is unforgettable, and 8.5 years after I read it, I still recommend it with teh same fervor I did then.	2000-11-15

I wasn't so sure if I'd really enjoy a novel about South/Central American politics.  What I found instead was a brilliant book  that walks the line between invention and reality.  The surprise ending of this book is not quite as explosive as the endign to The sixth sense (but almost.)  This book is fascinating in the combination of the erotic with the poetic.  And then in the last chapter, rather than feeling unforgiving for the fact that I'd been &quot;deceived&quot;, I was thrilled that I HAD the wool pulled over my eyes.  How? you may ask? I will not say any more.  Let's just say that this story on a writer's quest for truth, and the truth as he sees it is a great intoroduction to the works of Vargas Llosa, and one that you won't be able to get out of your mind.  Don't be surprised if you find yourself up at night thinking on the myriad plot points.  That's when you know a book really was worth your time.	2000-11-15

She is the prose equivalent of an early Joni Mitchell album, full of radiant images that make us perceive the world around us in an entirely new way. I  am a big Young Adult fiction nut, and I think these books are as good as  any.  They merge real issues into a fantasy fabric with everything else,  and the result is astonishing.<br />Block also shows how there are many ways  to feel different and isolated from the world around us, and the nature of  love and acceptance.  I can't say I am too crazy of her depiction of New  York as cold and ugly, that's just too easy.  But that minor poinr aside, I  think these books have a lot to say to everybody about life in this crazy  modern world, and how there really is such a thing as magic.  Of note to me  was the last book, &quot;Baby Be-Bop&quot; which successfully takes on  every other YA book about coming out, and leaves them in the dust. Imagine  a world in which gay people are told that their love is valid and  wonderful! And even better, nobody dies in a car accident.  If I saw Block,  I would give her a huge hug for the contribution she made into my life with  this book.  I was in tears by the end of Be-Bop, because, after 28 years, i  finally heard that it's perefctly fine to be who I am.  Thank you  Francesca.  The 4 other stories are quite wonderful as well.

On the one hand, there are so few real coming of age novels out there about the gay experience, and even fewer from the African-American male experience, every  time one is published, i should shout with joy.  My problem is not so much  with the story content... what a nice thing to read a gay coming of age  novel where the character doesn't fall into the club scene and get a great  apartment and a really hip social set.  By the end of the novel, our  character still has many things to learn, and mile to go before he sleeps.  That much was very appreciated.<br />I just found that the writing style  itself while very lucid and classy, was also a bit too sedate. The  narrative voice rarely goes into high or lows of higher emotion.  I was not  gripped while reading this book, and I think mainly because we are kept at  a distance from the characters.  I call this &quot;lithium fiction&quot;...  eliminating highs and lows.  The story itself is also fragmented.  We spend  3/4 of the book on one subject, and the last 1/4 on an entirely new  situation.  The two events just do not flow together so seamlessly.  This  resulted in me not wanting to rush home and read it like I do when I am  reading a really good book.<br />Call my cynical, but with its measured and  careful non-offensive prose, the study guide in the back (how awfully  presumptuous to include a reading group guide)as well as the book design,  it would seem that all fingers point to having this book aspire to being  considered for Oprah's Book of the Month.<br />I look forward to reading more  from Wright in the future, and think while this book is an uneven debut, it  is a book that needed to ahve been written.  perhaps next time, with more  spirit.	2000-03-12

This seems to be hands down the book that has angered the most people for its political undertones.  If you ask me, while the pro-life movement was savaged, not many of the pro-choicers came off  especially clean either.  (And let us not forget whose head gets shaved  clean off at a crucial moment.) I found the battle in this book in the  abortion wars to be one that was at least more credible than the ludicrous  Catholics vs. the Baptists bloody subplot of the even more ludicrous  &quot;Needful Things.&quot;  As for this book spouting feminist dogma, I  see nothing wrong with King writing novels in which women are empowered to  take their lives into their own hands for once, and find strength to do so.  True, the revelation of newfound lesbianism in one of the key characters  at the end seems to have come out of nowhere, but I see this novel for more  than the politics.  I found this an engaging, sprawling tale that, for the  most part, comes together in that uniquely King way.  (Face it folks... the  man can not only write, but he writes WELL.) The part involving an evil  ring does not seem to go anywhere except to prove to us that King has read  Tolkien.  We never seem to find out the real significance of the ring, but  it does give Ralph Roberts ample opportunity to quote &quot;Lord of the  Rings&quot; (which he does over and over again.) But I did enjoy this book  a lot.  I still hold that Tommyknockers, Dolores Claiborne and Misery are  my favorites by King, but this one combines all of my favorite King  elements: myriad characters, myriad weird events, and bizarre coincidences.  Why at one point in this story, I almost expected the Three Fates to drop  by... and surprise, they do!  The blend of down to earth New Englanders,  demons, Fates, references to other novels and a magic Port-A-Potty are  those things that make King an enjoyable and unpredictable read every time.  Kudos Stephen! The rest of you, just sit back some wintry evening, and  enjoy this novel.  It's worth it.enjoy this novel.  It's worth it.	2000-01-28

The concept of a store fulfilling everyone's desires with a price to pay is not exactly a new one, but I was excited to  see what King would do with it. I am a big fan of his books about small  towns, and read this right after The Tommyknockers, but was very  disappointed.<br />The first problem is that King doesn't make anybody in the  town especially likeable.  So when enemies confront one another to a  usually bloody end (of note was the stomach churning scene involving two  women, a butcher knife and a meat cleaver...) the reader just shrugs and  keeps on reading.  In nis zeal for blood, gore and more imaginative ways to  kill characters, King seems to have forgotten his heart.  And the elemen of  surprise.  How can any of us be truly stuinned by any events in a King  novel when we know that almost everyone (if not all) will end up dead in  the end?  It's even harder to care when he makes his residents of this  small Maine town about as appealing as Madame deFarge and company. Even the  main characters are rather one note, and act out of odd motives. For  example, what is exactly so scandalous about the way that Polly Chalmers  son died? The only real scene of humanity occurs near the end of the book  when Alan Pangborn visits a young 7 year old who is in a hospital bed. That  scene alone has real heart to it. Not that King needs to be touchy feely,  but his one dimensional characters this time all but wear saigns around  their neck saying what they are, &quot;Greedy, embezzling politican,&quot;  &quot;dimwitted deputy&quot;, &quot;Elvis worshipping mama&quot;..what  gives? One almost feels that King himself bought the plot for this novel at  the title store in exchange for his talent.  He even throws in a battle  royale between the towns Catholics and Baptists that not only make both  groups look like half witted idiots for never verifying any pranks as truly  being the responsibility of the other, but further, the cartoonis battle  scene, and the animosity between the two groups (and yes, the Baptists  sing, &quot;Onward Christian Soldier&quot; and the Catholics are a  belligerent, (probably hard drinking) bunch) smacks of something that would  have been written about earlier in the century, and not the 1990's.<br />As  for my last complaint, it would seem that in almost every book King writes,  any type of same sex activty is about molestation, perversion or is  caricatured so grotesquely that it would make any self respecting gay  person hide. (See my review of It which I read at 15.)Needful Things is no  different. In this book, our little small town homos are both, BOTH  pedophiles. What are the odds of that happening? (And, as a more  irresponsible tactic, King has them both in the educational system of the  town.  How very thoughtful of Mr. King.)  It is characters like that which  make me call King to task. I am not syaing he needs to write about gay  characters in a positive light, but after the sundry men making passes at  Jack in The Talisman, and the two guys in Chapter 2 of IT who are more  disgusting than the monster itself, and the weak ineffectual king in the  Eyes of the Dragon and now our dear friends, the perverts in Needful  Things, maybe King just shouldn't write about gay characters at all, at the  risk of alienating a large group of his fans.

If you just  want not awful, but not great, and are traveling by bus, plane or train...  read Needful Things.  Then leave it on the seat for the next person.

This is a gripping read	Okay, to be honest, the book gets gripping after one slogs through the first 200 pages.  Before that, we spend a looong time getting to know Bobbi Anderson and Jim Gardener.  But once the book expands its narrative to  include the members of the entire town of Haven, the book does not let up.<br />The first two hundred pages, and a bit too much techno jargon prevent me  from fully bestowing this book with a full 5 stars.  King has clearly done  his homework on this book, but after a while, all the descriptions of the  souped up gadgets made my eyes swim (much as Tolkien's endless landscape  descriptions in &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; made me wish good old John  Ronald Reuel had pioneered the minimalist writing style.)<br />The  Tommyknockers, while not my favorite King novel, is a great effort.  people  may complain about an anti-climactic ending (They must have read the ending  to a different book, the climax I read was rather exciting)or the fact that  the characters seem to stumble down a path of destruction.  Well, that  happens in life as well. I think King's writing is at the top of its  form... I think the scene when Jim Gardener drunkenly ruins an all too  polite cocktail party with a rant against the destructive powers of nuclear  energy is one of the most powerful scenes in all of King's canon, and one  of the most chilling without benefit of any super- or preter- natural  interference. Despite all of the evil the characters in his novels have  faced (indeed, Pennywise the clown makes a brief appearance in a city  sewer, which is odd as this tale is to have taken place 3 years after the  events in IT... one thinks King's editors add the dates of the events of  his novels to coincide with the publication dates and not to correspond  with when the novels were actually written. We also encounter a minor  character from the Dead Zone, and  &quot;blink and you'll miss them&quot;  references to &quot;Firestarter&quot; and &quot;Salem's Lot.&quot;) the  novel makes it explicit that the things that men do in the name of  scientific progress can be equally as terrifying as a young girl posessed  of psionic abilities.  True, the analogy between nuclear power and the  Tommyknockers polluting the air is about as subtle as Annie Wilkes  expressing discontent, but hey, it was written in the 80's, but it loses  none of its power. (No pun intended).<br />This is a very good book, probably  one of the most down to earth (again, no pun intended) science  fiction/horror tales around.

US	51304688	R1Q1V844NN9YXH	0451169522	916592852	Misery	Books	5	10	11	N	N	Wow.	Well, back when &quot;Misery&quot; was first published, I had no interest in it at all.  I was more of a fan of King's horror/ghostie stuff, and the premise when described to me (I was all of 15 at the time) sounded like a  major snooze.  I finally got around to reading this book last week, and I  have to say, &quot;Misery&quot; is probably King's equivalent of  Shakespeare's famous tragedy that begins with &quot;M&quot; whose full name  we dare not invoke due to the curse. &quot;Misery&quot; is lean, yet  muscular.  It is a book with tunnel vision, it does not digress from the  major plot, but rather keeps the reader staring straight ahead and biting  their nails.  Annie Wilkes has to be King's most monstrous (yet  ironically, literally the &quot;least&quot; monstrous) creation he ever  dared breathe life into. As such, after a while the reader, like Paul  Sheldon wants to take Noveril to take us out of the realm of Annie, yet  unlike Paul, we just can't WAIT to see what Annie will do next. King  replicates the formula of &quot;person trapped in a small space trying to  escape&quot; in other books (most notable in Gerald's Game) but this is  truly his finest hour at getting the reader into Paul's head, and feeling  his pain (and as I said before, his drugged bliss on Noveril).  I even give  credit to King for making us just as excited as Annie to see how Paul will  resolve bringing Misery back from the dead.  It's in the story within the  story that shows that King is a master of his game, deftly parodying the  gothic romance drama, while at the same time, presenting it in a very  straightfaced manner. This is definitely the book that I would say defines  King and his body of work. And the fact that it's a not so gentle look at  the limits of fandom that make this a book that you won't put down.	1999-11-30

He is an immensely talented man, probably the best contemporary author of mass market books (in my opinion). But he is human, and stumbles every now  and then. Even when he stumbles, I still cannot put him down, as was the  case with Rose Madder.  I don't have any problem with the general theme of  the book, indeed, it's very satisfying.  Norman is King's most monstrous  human villain since Annie Wilkes.  (Try not to be at the edge of your seat  as he slowly moves in on his wife.) No, it's not really the story I have a  problem with, even though I felt that this time, the supernatural elements  could have been left out and a more satisfying ending would have been for  Rose herself to afce Norman down, instead of some bizarre, unexplained  mystery woman who looks like Rose, but isn't. (King has this habit of late  of not really telling us who the supernatural characters are...and we end  up on the last page asking, &quot;What was that all about?&quot; See Storm  of the Century to learn more on that.) No, my only real problem is that  King is so so careful not to upset readers that he makes a few missteps in  the battered women storyline. First off, kudos to him for even approaching  this topic.  The first 5 pages of the book are among the most terrifying  he's ever written. Yet, he has Rose spend a month in a woman's shelter  after 14 years of severe abuse by an evil man, and after that, she can fall  into a relationship with anothe rman just like that! I think it would have  been more interesting, and built up Rose more as a character had she not  fallen in love and made it truly on her own. (Considering Rose's new love  interest is the anti-Norman, that is, one of King's dullest characters ever  conceived.)  King also seems to take pains to show us that battered women  don't hate men (this can be true) and amazingly, not one of the women in  this book is a lesbian, indeed, he bends over backward to stress that  point.  (Yet, when they hold a fundraiser later in the book, who is the  headlining act? None other than The Indigo Girls!)That said, I think that  by trying too carefully to avoid any such issue, the story feels flawed.  Indeed, Rose seeking other women for comfort and love seems a more natural  conclusion than the tacked on love interest who makes me yawn just by  thinking about him. This should not hamper ones enjoyment of the novel (and  it's a thrillride) but nor should it be taken as how women in shelters all  are (so desperate to prove that they STILL LIKE MEN!) All this, and a  strange coda that seems to have been borrowed from &quot;The Lord of the  Rings.&quot; You half expect to hear Rose start hissing, &quot;My  preciousssssss&quot; when she has her ex-husbands ring. Despite all this,  it was a Stephen King novel, and while I am pickier than most, a mediocre  King novel is sure a heck of a lot more pleasurable than most of the books  out there.  I think this book actually needs a sequel...I want to see more  of Rose's strange painting world.ckward to stress that  point.

Despite all this,  it was a Stephen King novel, and while I am pickier than most, a mediocre  King novel is sure a heck of a lot more pleasurable than most of the books  out there.  I think this book actually needs a sequel...I want to see more  of Rose's strange painting world.	1999-11-28

The gore didn't bother me, in fact, King so convincingly writes this book that you find yourself worrying if she's cold with the wind blowing around the lake, and this is  truly a book you should read while cozy in bed, snuggled up in blankets and  happy that you are not in this situation.  After a while, his writing makes  you feel as if you are in the pain she is in...it's very vivid.<br />My only  complaint is about the bizarre explanation at the end to the even more  bizarre visions Jessie has in her bedroom of the monstrous visitor.  King  seems to deflate his own story by an ending that seems tacked on as a last  minute addendum.  It would seem that this time, he pulled his punches and  instead of allowing us to be truly scared,he says, &quot;See, there was an  explanation after all!&quot; I would rather have been scared.	1999-11-25

Hmm, a man drifts into a village during a terrible storm, causes untold deaths, bizarre happenings..and he seems to be a man of untold power and evil because he gets people to kill themselves, and he tells the truth of  what people have been hiding.  The only real problem is: who the heck is  this guy? What was disappointing on the screen is even more disappointing  in book format (though we are spared the terrible, false New England  accents in the book.)  The killer or whatever he is is never really  explained who or what he is (King had better have a sequel planned)and  therefore, the thrust of the story is completely lost.  I feel this story  hurtles toward a climax that never comes, and is a generally unsatisfying  tale about the usual story of a town that seems to operate on a shared  brain. This is one of King's lesser efforts... I don't think I have ever  been as dissatisfied by a story and ending as this.  I can deal with a  hanging ending, but not by the complete lack of detail that makes Andre  Linoge the most dull and uninteresting villain King ever created. (Though,  I give credit to King for finally solving the mystery of the lost colony)  To misquote King, Linoge is a Bag of Bones, without the bones. Don't bother  with this unless you're a huge fan of screenplays. Plus, the editors did  not even think to add a list in the beginning of the main players of the  tale, and that completely detracts from ones comprehension of the tale.  Forget this one exists, despite the throwaway reference in the script to  Dolores Claiborne.	1999-11-25
US	51304688	RG720L58EPJAF	0451169514	380266608	It	Books	3	8	12	N	N	I am finally going to sound off about this book!	I went through a  huge Stepehen King phase in the mid 80's in my early teens. For my 15th birthday, I was fervently praying for his new book, &quot;IT&quot; in hardcover.  I loved the suspense, the horror..for two  weeks I could not put this book down while I plowed through it.  The story  was well plotted, and it never felt to me that I was reading a book over  1000 pages long.  The characters are great, the story wonderfully  eerie..<br />With that said, I must say that I only gave this three stars on a  personal bias.  The portrayal of the gay men at the beginning of the novel  was not only rather stereotypical, but it surely made us feel no sympathy  for them. They were freaks in themselves. As a teen who was struggling with  his sexuality as he read &quot;IT&quot;, that was enough to put me off King  for years. Maybe it was personal sensitivty, but I do feel that many other  ethnic/minority groups would not have been portrayed in such a nasty  manner. True, this was the 80's when homophobia, due to AIDS and the like,  was reaching an all time high.  But to see soemthing like this in popular  fiction and having nobody ever even address it because he is such a well  known author,a nd well liked is sad.  I am glad to be reading King once  again, and I have let bygones be bygones.  I do not advocate taking this  book of the shelf or revising it, I just see it as a dark spot on his  career.  Word of advice: skip the part about the gay men, and just enjoy  the rest of the book.	1999-10-09

Bag of Bones is an engrossing tale that, while it falters a bit at the end, is a great and fun read.  This was the first King book I had read in 13 years- I was never able to quite forgive him for the  truly despicable characterizations of gay men in &quot;IT&quot;, and so,  went on a decade plus hiatus- but with this book, I am back.  The story is  unpredicatble, veers wildly, and while it doesn't have a sense of humor  that other books of his do, I can think of no book I have read in a long  time that so aptly conveys the feelings of loss and isolation when a spouse  dies. King is right on target, and indeed, that's the most moving part of  the tale. The final few chapters tend to falter as some characters are  forgotten, and things are not clearly explained.  And one can see King's  editor asking him for more blood and gore that leaves one with the  lingering feeling that the climax on the dock was written with a screenplay  in mind.  Despite the rather cliched round up (that sadly brings to mind  the recent film, &quot;Stir of Echoes&quot;) Bag of Bones is a fun read,  with grief, sadness and rage as well as an ambivalence on the part of the  reader between what is good and what is evil.	1999-10-09
