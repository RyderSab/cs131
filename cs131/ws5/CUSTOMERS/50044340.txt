These are recipes to make in a cast iron skillet, not a microwave. The recipe for shrimp and grits, the signature dish at the late author's restaurant in Chapel Hill, NC, is itself worth the cover price. Somewhat like Carol Field's \\"Italian Baker,\\" this book offers some insight into the history of the recipes but is not full of fluffy digressions. My copy is dog-eared and bears a few sauce stains after years of use. It is nicely organized into sections such as soups, breads, rice, vegetables, fish and shellfish, meats and desserts. Besides shrimp and grits, I'm very fond of the recipes for chess pie and Sally Lunn bread. Like THE JOY OF COOKING, this book offers precise directions on the finer points of cooking that make a difference between a good dish and a great one. Highly recommended.	2005-09-27

It garners various reviews, from great praise to condemnation. (One reader even complains that the hero of the story is a heretic who denied the Trinity, and as such should not be held up to be a hero, something akin to complaining that Martin Luther King, Jr. was a black man who advocated civil rights.) I found it a good read. As the title suggests, the authors' point of view is sympathetic to Servetus, and less so to his adversaries including John Calvin and the Catholic Church. It is not surprising then that the book is not warmly received by Calvinists.    The authors' tone and style reminds me of the television program \\"Connections,\\" so much so that I often imagine that show's host John Burke reading the narrative aloud. Like Burke, authors Lawrence and Nancy Goldstone do not hesitate to insert witty asides or editorial comments into their historical tale. Such a style is well-suited to telling the story of Michael Servetus, a mostly obscure scholar who rubbed elbows with many famous historical figures. One of the most fascinating chapters in the book is a brief digression devoted entirely to the famous physician and anatomist Vesalius.     Servetus is a fascinating if not very likeable person, and readers who must personally admire the subject of a biography in order to enjoy it may be rankled at times by Servetus' actions, which seem to be fueled by a mix of genius, arrogance, pride and stupidity. He certainly had chutzpah. At one point, already condemned by the Spanish Inquisition and living under an assumed name, he faces charges again, and successfully argues in front of the Inquisition and has those charges dropped.	2005-09-23

It is an engrossing work of literature that just happens to fall under the sci-fi umbrella. I liked Le Guin's technique of occasionally inserting chapters in the form of anthropological monographs, and I feel it worked well, especially when they quoted mythological tales collected from the peoples in the story. These tales [of course invented by Le Guin] really packed the sort of Jungian wallop that our own myths often have. But these digressions are brief, unlike the lengthy chapters on cetology and whatnot in Melville's MOBY DICK, and serve to enrich the story rather than distract from it.	2005-09-21
US	50044340	R6JISMY9AW1BO	158754105X	832408663	The Face In The Frost	Books	4	11	11	N	N	a good read	I'm not a huge aficianado of the fantasy genre but I enjoyed this 1969 novella by John Bellairs. The writing is above-average, the principal characters have some personality, and there is some enjoyable chemistry between the characters. (Often the banter between Prospero and Roger Bacon reminded me of Paul Newman and Robert Redford in \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\\") Like Lois Lowry's THE GIVER, it is a book that can be enjoyed by adults as well as older children. I'd recommend it to Harry Potter fans as well as to readers who loved The Lord of the Rings. One aspect that I liked was that the scarier parts of the book were written to creep out the adults more than children, as it was mostly the implication of a pervasive, world-altering evil that provided most of the chills, rather than big, scary, nightmare-inducing monsters.     Bellairs himself admitted that he was inspired by The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and wanted to write a book about a character similar to Tolkien's Gandalf but with a little more depth to his personality. I think he succeeded. The wizards in his book, especially Prospero, possess only limited magical powers, and thus have weaknesses, fears and even phobias. They are more like a endearing pair of elderly, absent-minded professors.    Readers who are intrigued by the mysterious, enciphered book of spells featured in THE FACE IN THE FROST may be interested to know that it is based on the real-life Voynich Manuscript. (Bellairs even names one of his characters after a real-life English scholar-monk who has been linked to the Voynich Manuscript, Roger Bacon.) This medieval manuscript, written in an unknown language or ciphertext, has never been decoded despite the efforts of scholars and professional cryptanalysts over several centuries.     If I had to level criticism at THE FACE IN THE FROST it would be that the ending is brought about with a sort of deus-ex-machina plot device. But really I was sorry that the book was so short andover so soon, because it was a fun, stimulating read.	2005-09-06
US	50044340	RJ3AT4AEMY0GS	0446310786	994527755	To Kill a Mockingbird	Books	5	1	2	N	N	disarmingly simple and easy to read	Like many great work of literature, this one packs a lot into its opening passages. It begins, \\"When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow.... When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident.\\" Right off the bat we are made aware that we are about to read of  past events monumental enough to make the participants dwell on them decades later. There is the suggestion that there's more than meets the eye in what's about to unfold, so you'd better pay attention. And, there's the hint of violence in the mentioning of the broken arm. Was it really an accident? We'll have to read to find out.    Often it is said that TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is told through the eyes of a child. This is not strictly true. The narrator of the novel is the now-grown daughter of Atticus Finch, nicknamed \\"Scout\\" in her youth, recalling events from her childhood, albeit in extended passages evoking the point of view of her childhood. This seemingly simple device is a sophisticated one that allows the author a lot of freedom and power to tell the story. The younger Scout's disarming innocence serves as a vehicle for a more direct description of people and events -- after all, a child sees and hears well enough, but she doesn't understand -- allowing Lee to show rather than merely tell about people and events. And, when it suits the author, the adult Scout can address the reader more directly. This slight of hand with the point of view is, I believe, instrumental in creating a novel where the characters seem to come to life and leap off the pages. It's always a delight when writing so technically well-thought-out remains so easy to read. Small wonder that adults should love the book so much and urge middle school students to read it. It is an approachable masterpiece.    Some readers may complain that the novel takes its time getting around to what is considered its pivotal element, the trial of Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman. I cannot see how Lee could have possibly told her story otherwise. We start with the children, who make up their own games and stories and more or less invent their own world as much as possible. Then the adult world gradually intrudes on Scout, her brother Jem, and their peculiar friend Dill Harris. Without being immersed in the children's Eden first, we cannot really understand the point of view of the narrator, who is telling the tale of her loss of innocence.  Much is made of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD as an indictment of racism. Certainly an awareness of and sensitivity to racial injustice informs the novel throughout, but I think it is really a tale of paradise lost, which happens to be told in the setting of racial conflict. This is the source I think of the novel's melancholy universality, for regardless whether you grew up in Alabama or in Zimbabwe, there comes a time in your life when you realize that the world isn't a very nice place, but there are still some things worth fighting for, and it's often surprising and inspiring just who the real heroes turn out to be.	2005-08-16

The drawings not only illustrate the cathedral's method of construction, but convey the presence and majesty of the space as well. One feels the dizzying height of the tower and the formidable strength of the foundation stones. I was always amazed at the ingenuity of the laborers in completing tasks that I would have otherwise felt impossible to attemp without power tools. <br /> <br />While it is hard to predict whether today's children will find the book as captivating as I did in the pre-internet era, I feel that David Macaulay's books make excellent gifts to children. Not only do they stimulate the imagination, but they educate children on architecture, history and culture, and show that magnificent works can be accomplished through cooperation, creativity, planning and hard work. Not bad for a few bucks! I recommend you splurge on the hardback, because this is a book you'll enjoy literally for decades.	2005-08-12

Mullin has hit the nail on the head, calling THE NAME OF THE ROSE \\"a rewarding but painstaking read.\\" Often I felt that my enjoyment of the novel was like that of one of the groundlings at a performance of HAMLET. That is, there's an exciting murder mystery going on but there's a lot that's going over my head, what with all the passages in Latin.  <br /> <br />That said, this is a highly enjoyable caper set in a medieval Italian monastery, a setting ripe with atmosphere to say the least, that should appeal to intelligent readers as well as the admittedly middle-brow folks such as myself. I did not have the companion books available when I read it, so I simply skimmed over parts that I didn't udnerstand until I got back to the meat of the story. Perhaps someday I will revisit the book and get even more out of it.	2005-08-10

I love this book and have read it more times than any other work of fiction.<br /><br />For me the greatest pleasure comes from savoring the many colorful characters, not only Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, who surpass even Shakespeare's Benedick and Beatrice as the thinking person's ideal romantic match, but also Miss Bingley, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Collins and all the others. Austen employs the vices and virtues of this cast of characters to great effect -- for comedy, drama, suspense, and especially dramatic irony. Individual scenes that come to mind are Elizabeth's rejection of her first marriage proposal, one of the most memorable comic scenes in English literature, and her rejection of a second offer of marriage, a scene that may very well prompt the reader to shout at the heroine in a futile attempt to intervene.<br /><br />With each re-reading I discover more to understand and love about PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Not only do the individual characters serve as foils to each other, but relationships between characters serve as foils to other relationships. On first reading, I saw how much love and respect there exists between Elizabeth and her father. I saw how similar Mr. Darcy is to Mr. Bennet and understood the perfectness of a match between Darcy and Elizabeth.  On subsequent readings I discovered that Miss Bingley, who is so critical and so mocking of the Bennetts' humble position in society, is more like Mrs. Bennett than any other character, and a chapter in which Darcy seems to arrive at this conclusion himself came alive for me, and I now recognize it as a pivotal moment in the story whereas previously it had seemed like a duller chapter to skim over.<br /><br />All of this sounds very dry and intellectual I suppose, but the experience of reading the novel is anything but. What propels the reader through the book is the apprehension that Elizabeth and Darcy have gotten off on the wrong foot, and while at odds are clearly made for each other in every possible respect. This tension makes it a highly enjoyable page-turner. Nor is PRIDE AND PREJUDICE a fluffy romance novel or a \\"chick flick.\\" Given the economic realities of the times, Elizabeth is risking not only spinsterhood but also economic disaster by not seizing on opportunities to marry any man with a decent income or place in society. By refusing to settle, Elizabeth is a very brave character in her own arena, and for that reason we recognize her as a hero, a noble soul who honors responsibilties, stands fearless in the face of snobbery and oppression, laughs at folly (while exhibiting some of her own as well), and aches for true love. Who cannot root for such a character or rejoice at the happy conclusion of her quest?	2005-08-08

Readers who are more visually-oriented would likely find this to be a helpful adjunct to Cumpiano's and Nattleson's seminal book GUITARMAKING: TRADITION AND TECHNOLOGY. <br /> <br />While a book on lutherie, like a cookbook, is primarily judged on its ability to help the reader successfully accomplish the task in question, I must take the author to task here for his shameless self-promotion throughout the work. The author's name conspicuously appears on almost every single page. For example,  helpful tips in an aside are titled \\"Kinkead Tips,\\" and in almost every photo featuring a luthier at work [presumably the author himself], he is wearing a T shirt bearing the words KINKEAD GUITARS, with the logo strategically placed to be in full view. It is distracting, tiresome and even a little insulting to endure this narcissistic self-promotion page after page. Every book on lutherie is a sort of calling card for the luthier-author, and the quality of the book should speak of the quality of the luthier's own work. Kinkead would score more points with discerning guitarmakers and guitarists with a little more discretion, instead of coming off as something of a carnival barker.  <br /> <br />That said, the book is nevertheless useful for the above-mentioned reasons, but I doubt that it will ever be a beloved book that I enjoy leafing through over and over like some of my other favorite books on guitarmaking.	2005-03-05

Used copies are for sale at very high prices (over $100!) that are really not worth paying. That said, if you could find this book at reasonable prices it would be worth owning. In many ways, David Russell Young's book is the predecessor of Jonathan Kinkead's recently published book on guitar construction, especially in that it is extensively illustrated with photos showing the step-by-step process of making the guitar. Like Irving Sloane, Young's method involves constructing the rim with the aid of a mold, followed by attachement of the back and sides. Young, too, has his own unusual method of attaching the neck to the body: the flat heel of the neck is apparently glued directly to the body without a dovetail or tenon joint. This point is not extensively documented, which is a shortcoming, but on the other hand I wouldn't really consider the technique in the first place so who cares. <br /> <br />In conclusion, I don't recommend that anyone pay high prices for this out-of print-book, but it may be worthwhile to look for it in your public library if you want to get another point of view on guitar construction. If David Russell Young were to publish another updated version of his book, perhaps with color photographs and more in-depth coverage of neck-to-body joining, I  would probably buy it. On the other hand, Jonathan Kinkead seems to have picked up Young's torch with his recent book BUILD YOUR OWN ACOUSTIC GUITAR: COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS AND FULL-SIZE PLANS.	2005-03-05

A reprint was published in 1990. It is out of print, but still for sale new from luthier supply catalogs. Used copies can also be found through Amazon. <br /> <br />The book is nicely illustrated with clear black-and-white photographs on nearly every page, many of which are large, full-page pictures. Sloane's method of construction involves the assembly of the rim using a rudimentary mold, then attachment of the back and sides, and then the neck. His method of joining the neck to the body is unusual and I doubt that I would ever attempt it. There are also sections on inlay and finishing techniques. <br /> <br />Like Cumpiano's book this one is quite old and does not reflect recent innovations in guitar construction. I am not certain that builders on a budget would want to put Sloane's book high on their list of required reading. Nevertheless it is a good book and it is always worthwhile to see how different builders go about different ways of solving a problem. As an aside, there is a brief section on archtop guitar construction which is interesting in that it shows famous arch-top makers John D'Angelico and his successor James D'Aquisto at work in their shop. This may be the most worthwhile thing in Sloane's book, given the abundance of guitar construction information available on the internet and in newer publications.	2005-03-05

Ferrington's work is about 180 degrees from the traditional approach of luthiers such as William Cumpiano. On most acoustic guitars Ferrington's method of neck-to-body attachment is via four bolts a la Fender electric guitars. The best thing about this book is the delightful smorgasbord of shapes, colors and sizes of Ferrington's guitars. As an amateur luthier I never tire of leafing through the book as it is so stimulating to the imagination. The photos are very well done, with many nice close-ups of design features or hardware. There is a 6-page montage of Ferrington's construction methods but this is not really a book on lutherie methods.	2005-03-05

The book's stance is clearly \\"old school,\\" and it shows how to make the entire guitar by hand, from scratch, right down to the bracing and the kerfed liner. While I myself have little to no intention of hand-sawing my own kerfed lining any time soon, I am nonetheless gratified to have on hand a reference work that would assist me in doing so if I wanted to.   <br /> <br />Some of the methods described in this book do seem outdated.  To an extent that is because the craft has continued to blossom since the publication of Cumpiano's book. And yet if I could have only a single book on the subject it would be this one. (It is sort of like the lutherie equivalent of THE JOY OF COOKING.) One true weakness of the book that other reviewers have pointed out is the side-by-side coverage of steel string and classic guitar construction. I think these two subjects would be better addressed in separate volumes, ideally with discussion on the multiple ways to perform tasks such as joining the neck to the body or bending the sides.	2005-02-24

Jim Williams' book is certainly inexpensive, and has the added bonus of ring-binding that allows you to open it flat in your work area. It is not a comprehensive volume and if you could only have one or two books on lutherie, this one probably would not make the cut. That said, I actually found it quite useful at times when building my first guitar, a kit project purchased from a well-known American guitar company, in that Williams' overall method of assembly lent itself well to the assembly of the kit.     Another reviewer has pointed out correctly that in general the lutherie literature is behind the times compared to the internet, where much information on guitarmaking is freely shared. I think a modern book on modern guitarmaking would ideally come with a CD-ROM chock full of detailed, color photographs. While it would be cost-prohibitive to publish a book with so many color photographs, the cost of digital photography on a CD-ROM is minimal.     In conclusion, I would recommend this book as a adjunct to other, more comprehensive books on guitarmaking, especially to beginners working with a kit project that comes with somewhat scanty instructions. The writing of an up-to-date book on flat top guitar construction awaits, perhaps for the collaborative efforts of professional and amateur lutheriers everywhere. It would certainly be a gratifying project.	2005-02-22

The basic premise is simple enough: these people from another time and country are going to build something, and the book is going to show us how they did it. The text itself, as with many children's books, is relatively simple, but the intricate pen-and-ink drawings are spellbinding. Time and again I would go back to CITY, and pore over the pictures, often discovering some previously-overlooked detail that Macaulay had included.     I highly recommend CITY, and Macaulay's other architectural books, to both children and adults. Most children are inherently curious, and interested in how things are made, why they work, and who made them. Macaulay teaches those things in his books, but more importantly, the books draw the reader in and stimulate the imagination. There's a hands-on history lesson inherent in each of these books, a brief glimpse at other cultures around the globe and in different times. Whether it's ancient Egypt, classical Rome, medieval France, or 18th Century America, the worlds in Macaulay's books are always fascinating to visit.	2004-12-06

This book is so badly written that I cannot believe that the editors at The Dial Press actually read it all the way through before approving its publication.    Somewhere buried in The Rule of Four is an interesting historical mystery, but it is suffocated by an almost unbelievably trite modern tale of four undergraduates at Princeton. I was amazed at how often the plot shifted to their innane parties, relationships and Saabs when it seemed like something really cool should be happening instead.     By way of analogy, recall the film \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\\" Remember the jeweled medallion that Indiana Jones found that, when placed on a staff of correct height, could be used to reveal the location of the Ark of the Covenant? Imagine how you would feel if Indiana Jones, having just learned of the vital importance of that medallion, instead of proceeding to put it to use, became completely absorbed by the preparations for the history department's yearly Christmas party. (What will I wear? Who should be my date? Why yes, I'd love another white chocolate truffle...) And furthermore, you never even got to see Indiana find the Ark. Instead, as part of the denoument, he got a letter from a good buddy who had located it. Now if \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" had made those choices (and I assure you my analogy is quite apt), you'd feel like the film had not only become suddenly very dull and even ridiculous, but that it had deliberately forsaken something exciting and dramatic to achieve dullness. The Rule of Four does just that, over and over again.    Another mortal sin this book commits is name-dropping. The authors have their characters constantly mentioning historical artists, thinkers, poets, and other luminaries of the Renaissance. By the end of the novel, The Rule of Four has name-dropped basically an entire undergraduate education on you. Even worse, it condescends to the reader by explaining every reference.     The only thing that would possibly excuse such stupid choices made by the authors would be the idea that The Rule of Four, like the ancient work Hypnerotomachia Poliphili that lies at the core of its plot, contains secret messages encoded in its otherwise long and trite chapters. Indeed it would be fitting to have indulged in steganography in this novel given its subject matter, but the book itself is so tiresomely sophomoric that one is not inclined to give it the benefit of the doubt. Even if these two young writers had been clever enough to encode a message or two in their novel, it would probably be something along the lines of \\"YALE SUCKS, GO PRINCETON TIGERS.\\"	2004-11-05

It should never be required reading in high school, although intelligent young readers would certainly love it. (Now that I think about it, some of the violent scenes are probably too gory for today's politically correct curriculum anyway.) It is the sort of book that someone's older brother at college lends to them, and then they pass it on to their best friend, and so on. There's a lot to this book beyond the plot, but unlike many other books that strive to explore deep human themes of life, sex and death, this one is approachable and very readable.  <br /> <br />The only reason I can think of not to drop everything and read this book right away (look how cheap the used copies are, for crying out loud!), is if you are planning a long voyage and want to make sure you have something really great to read along the way, in which case I would wait. While I am sorry that I didn't the book myself until I was 34, I had the great gift of reading it on a camping trip amidst hills, streams, pine tress and a rocky coastline that made it easy to imagine myself in the mountains of Spain along with the characters, and that made it worth the wait.	2004-11-05
US	50044340	R3TPOK4ZWJFJ10	0312319517	604432126	Avenger	Books	2	1	1	N	N	disappointment	AVENGER is a let-down compared to other Forsyth works. The cast of characters is large, and many of them are obviously there simply to advance the plot. Yet Forsyth gives paragraphs and sometimes pages of background information on these characters. The effect is like enduring the phony pleasantries of a salesman who is chatting you up before the pitch. Secondly, the success of the hero depends on the \\"bad guys\\" making a series of stupid mistakes, to the point that it becomes difficult to suspend disbelief. Thirdly, even as far as action adventures go, this one is lacking because the hero has almost no downturns or setbacks against which he must struggle. Even an episode of \\"Scooby Doo\\" has more plot twists. Finally, Forsyth frequently employs a prissy sort of writing style, using euphemisms and phrases in quotation marks when a direct statement would be more approriate.  The overall effect is smarmy, outdated and predictable, like a Roger Moore-era James Bond flick.	2004-10-09
US	50044340	R3USW2QK7OEP37	0399149724	619984812	The Confessor	Books	3	4	5	N	N	not bad	This is the first book by Daniel Silva that I have read. On the one hand, The Confessor has an interesting premise and plot, and is written in a competent manner. On the other hand, it suffers from being populated by a cast of supermen. That is, almost everyone in the book is some sort of high-ranking official, powerful banker, or expert assassin, etc. These characters glide over the real world, and consequently the action is almost devoid of the sort of gritty details that make a truly great book so captivating. Other reviewers have commented that this is not Silva's best work. I will probably try another Silva book such as Mark of the Assassin the next time I am looking for some light reading.	2004-09-05
US	50044340	R2BE593IGF8MO2	055314765X	999720718	The Day of the Jackal	Books	5	10	11	N	N	still the best espionage thriller	The only bad thing I can say about Day of the Jackal is that just about every other espionage/thriller novel that I have read since then has paled in comparison. Forsyth's novel moves at a steady pace, shifting its focus between an enigmatic assassin and the French police inspector who is doggedly pursuing him. The journalistic writing style shuns sensationalism for fly-on-the-wall realism, and indeed one of the pleasures of Day of the Jackal is the voyeuristic look into the underworld it provides. While Day of the Jackal makes no attempt to tackle great themes of \\"literature,\\" it succeeds so well in entertaining the reader that it belongs on the shelf next to Ernest Hemingway or Jack London rather than certain contemporary writers whose contributions to this genre suffer in comparison.	2004-09-05
US	50044340	R1G82IFYQ3Y2ON	015100093X	733601761	A Drink Before the War	Books	2	6	11	N	N	about on par with a made-for-tv movie	I discovered Lehane by way of the film &quot;Mystic River,&quot; and was happy to see that this author had several titles in print. I chose &quot;A Drink Before the War&quot; as a starting point more or less at random. I read the book over a couple of days while on vacation.<br />I found it pretty disappointing in several respects. Despite the fact that the book is set in Boston, and written by a native Bostonian, it lacks much in the way of an organic sense of place. The action occurs in various areas of Boston, but it felt more like I was watching a slide show of the city rather than spending time with characters in their native habitat.<br />Another weakness is that Lehane often fails to obey the dictum to show and not simply tell. For example, much is made of an impending war between rival gangs, whose leaders are an estranged father and son pair. Then the war drama unfolds primarily &quot;offscreen&quot; and we are merely told that one of them has won the war by virtue of surprising prowess as a tactician.  Contrast this to books such as &quot;The Godfather&quot; or &quot;Day of the Jackal&quot; which are each full of little details of setting and character that seem to have reached the page via personal recollection by an eyewitness.	2004-05-21
US	50044340	RSNM0ITGQ6MGK	0781726492	776735858	Radiobiology for the Radiologist	Books	4	11	19	N	N	good but not perfect	Yes, this book covers the important topics, and overall it is pretty readable, but I wish the editors had not felt compelled to convert every single mention of Grays into rads. For example, here is a passage from the book:<br />\\"In 1964, a 38-year-old man, working in a uranium-235 recovery plant, was involved in an accidental nuclear excursion. He received a total-body dose estimated to be about 88 Gy (8,800 rads) made up of 22 Gy (2,200 rads) of neutrons and 66 Gy (6,600 rads) of gamma-rays.\\"<br />The whole book is like that. The mental intrusion of such frequent parenthetical remarks would be irritating enough in any text, but in this case the conversion from Grays and rads is by a multiple of ten and so the conversion is comically unnecessary. Presumably radiation oncologists, radiologists, and radiobiologists are bright enough to be able to multiply a number by 100 in their heads. It would suffice to state in the front of the book or in an appendix the relationship between  Grays and rads, and to make no further mention of rads.	2003-09-23

In short, the book greatly exceeded my expectations, being both more entertaining and more literary than I ever would have expected from a novel of the mystery or suspense genre. Hjortsberg's writing is the epitome of unpretentious intelligence. Each chapter advances the plot in some way, with the precision of a well-written short story. Often, seemingly casual details of the setting or a character turn out to be subtle and wryly-humorous bits of foreshadowing. Another reviewer has praised the evocative descriptions of post-war New York. I was simply compelled at every point in this novel to keep reading, not because of some cheap cliff-hanger ending to a chapter, but because the plot was always getting thicker, juicier, and definitely creepier.    Of all the books I have bought in the last few years this is the one that was the best reward for taking chances on unknown books or authors (and the consolation for all the ones that were disappointments). Whether you call it horror, mystery, suspense or just simply literature, FALLING ANGEL is a great read.	2003-09-20
US	50044340	R7VI8V13RJNDB	0375415718	684734174	Omerta	Books	3	0	0	N	N	entertaining	I listened to the audio version of Omerta on CD while on a long day's drive. It was certainly enjoyable enough to hold my attention and make the miles and hours pass more easily. The story was straightforward and is summarized nicely by other reviewers. One of the main shortcomings of Omerta is that the characters do not change or grow through the story, in contrast to Michael Corleone in The Godfather, for example. (Perhaps this is a fault of the abridgement for audio rather than of the novel itself.) At other times, Puzo glosses over events that are so improbable as to demand more explanation. For example, one police officer is killed and another wounded when a car bomb explodes. In the trunk of the car was $480,000. Despite the highly suspicious nature of this event, the surviving, courrupt police officer is soon back on the street wielding a gun and killing suspects with impunity. One gets the impression that Puzo doesn't really know very much about how police forces work.	2003-09-15

US	50044340	R2915FYQH2STQ6	0679768394	194324903	The Voyage: A Novel	Books	2	3	5	N	N	this disappointing book needed a good editor	The author of this book obviously lacks a good editor who could have told him to dump the entire framing device of the modern-day narrator. The story of the three boys on the ship is compelling enough that you might overlook some of its flaws, but the interruption by the narrator disrupts completely the ability of the reader to suspend disbelief. It's like the author had all this backstory he wanted to include, and ended up tacking it all on at the end with the narrator's story. <br />Besides that glaring flaw, the book also lacked fully fleshed out characters. The boys sail down the coast and meet up with a series of two-dimensional people whose only distinguishing characteristics are their various vernacular speech patterns. A more politically-correct type than myself might call some of them racist, but to me it was just dull and disappointing, especially since the premise of three brothers cast out to sea by their stern father is such a great starting point for an exciting novel. Too bad this one sank.	2002-06-25
US	50044340	R1ZZ3B2J6NQCI1	0684837897	589664240	The Dangerous Summer	Books	5	6	6	N	N	one of my favorite books	During the 1959 bullfighting season, Hemingway travels with one of the matadors and his team throughout Spain. Hemingway's other book on bullfighting, \\"Death In the Afternoon\\" is more well-known and perhaps more informative, strictly speaking, but it is dry in comparison to \\"The Dangerous Summer,\\" which has the pace of an adventure novel or a thriller. And in that respect it seems to capture the excitement of bullfighting better than \\"Death in the Afternoon.\\" (I say \\"seems to\\" because I've never been to a bullfight.) I also loved the descriptions of Spain that Hemingway offers as they travel around the country.	2001-03-06
US	50044340	RIQN39PBIALLX	0061812668	617268636	The Italian Baker	Books	5	136	140	N	N	A great book	When I was hired to be the bread baker at an Italian restaurant in Carrboro, NC, I had no experience baking. The chef told me the restaurant wanted to start baking its own bread instead of buying it from a local  bakery. She handed me this book, and I took it home to read and to pick out  some recipes to try out. <br />I found the book quite readable, and I agree  with the reviewer below who praises the book's &quot;detailed, insatiable  descriptions of the regions, and history of the recipe at hand.&quot;  Also  worthy of praise are the sections on the fundmentals of baking, which were  particularly helpful to me when I was learning to bake. By covering the  fundamentals and the various techniques used in different regions of Italy,  the book gave me a good idea of what aspects I could experiment with  comfortably, and which steps were more or less prescribed. <br />Our baking  program turned out to be a success. Diners were especially fond of the  scroll-shaped loaves that we learned to make from &quot;The Italian  Baker.&quot;  Later we started making sourdough bread at the restaurant,  based on techniques learned from this book. One night after we had been at  it for a few weeks, one of our waiters came back into the kitchen to pass  on compliments from a diner from San Francisco who said that our sourdough  bread was as good as any she had had at home in SF. We were ecstatic. Only  a few months before my cooking expertise had been more or less limited to  heating up canned soup!<br />So I give this book a very enthusiastic  recommendation for anyone wanting to bake Italian bread and then possibly  go on to improvise their own loaves. In addition to being well-written, it  is also a very handsome volume.	2000-04-26

The book is very informative as to the history of the guitar, from its origins in the early 50's through its various subtle changes over the years and up to the present time. <br />The book is both detailed and concise. It contains much  info on the guitar, but not &quot;more than you'd ever want to know.&quot;  It is well-photographed, well written, and generally was everything I had  hoped it would be when I ordered it.	2000-04-25
