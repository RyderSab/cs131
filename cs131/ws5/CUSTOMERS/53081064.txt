This is the only book of its kind to actually show you actual executed trades (good ones and bad ones) over a few weeks time period. Complete with all the problems that will plague traders such as failing internet connections, faulty alarm clocks, etc.<br />This book didn't really capture my attention as I was first reading it. But an interesting thing began to happen nearing the end as I actually started to feel Tony's &quot;rhythm&quot; of trading. I suddenly felt that the books value went up tremendously at that moment.<br />Tony Oz focuses on the typical elements you face when trading: entry price tactics, stop losses, classical charting techniques, exit tactics, and psychology. While these topics are fairly widely covered topics in different books, the best thing about this book is that it simply allows you to get a feel for how a real trader USES those elements and distills them down to what's absolutely necessary and what's just textbook filler.<br />Daytrading books haven't really been published at all within the last few years due to the obvious fact that many traders were wiped out when the internet bubble popped. While many older books on daytrading have now become outdated, this book shows the common denominator in all successful trading, whether it be a bubble or a recession.	2004-03-23

Get this book!	John Grinder and Richard Bandlers collaboration in Trance Formations truly aims at the heart of what NLP is all about.<br />While many other books and individuals have tried to capitalize upon the methodologies within NLP, this book is probably where a lot of the other books derived from. Because of this, the book is highly concentrated with information about linguistics and most importantly, using it to your advantage.<br />This highly distilled book is comprised essentially of the transcript of a seminar which doesn't allow for the best outlay that you may come to expect in a book. There is no table of contents or an index. However, the fact that what these guys are saying is so clear, so distilled, and so elucidating, it's extremely easy to forgive them for the lack of structure in the book.<br />I personally carried this book around like a bible after I had first bought it reading as much as possible. Most of the seminar transcript is also where Grinder/Bandler are using the NLP to influence the audience, so you can actually see how masters of NLP use their technique.<br />Some of the topics that are covered are: presuppositions, nominalizations, unspecified referential indexes, deletion, mind-reading, ordinal numerals, awareness predicates, and a whole slew of other techniques.<br />It was only after the usage of this book that I truly began to integrate the use of NLP into my life and finally understood how language, pacing, breathing, and touching can truly allow someone to experience things in a different manner.<br />This book took me a little extra time to digest, keeping in mind that the intended audience is well educated therapists. However, their speaking style is not difficult to comprehend and anyone wanting to learn NLP and you can do so very well with a solid study of this book.	2004-01-07

I wanted to finish it just to see if it would get better. It didn't...it was poorly written, terribly organized, and also made me think the author was using free association when he began to write this book (which is evident to his annoying, valueless references to other chapters every few paragraphs).<br />The back cover touts that he puts the \\"story\\" in History. Nothing could be further from the truth. The book itself is somewhat boring, because there isn't enough detail to make a story. The books major problem is simple. It's jammed and crammed with trivial facts, facts that mean nothing unless they're strung together with some concept or generalization to take away from it. Rather than cover an important topic well, he's seemingly opted to give every event and every no-name empire a place in his book by devoting a few sentences to each and every one of them but not enough to allow any true of true understanding of what he's talking about. At the end of the book, I was left with a strange sensation of feeling like I knew nothing about a lot of things.<br />Often times the amount of detail he goes into leaves you wondering what happened in huge gaps of time he's left out (or perhaps he refers to the gap he just created in another chapter). The point is, you're left not having any real idea of what was going on because you can't fit it together in any way.<br />I'd love to speak with someone that learned history only from this book. They'd sound like a historian at their first comment about history (due to all the highly obscure details he dips quickly in and out of), but as soon as I asked one question about it, they'd be at a complete loss. The book fails to provide enough details to make you seem intelligent sounding in any area he writes about and the book fails to deliver generalizations and concepts because they were too fractured because of the terrible outlay of the book.<br />Dummies books are typically great books...this one was not. While this book is not a total loss, I would never ever recommend it.e typically great books...this one was not. While this book is not a total loss, I would never ever recommend it.	2003-12-26

I recently read this book to prepare for the Series 7 and was not very impressed. After passing the Series 7 (with an 84%) and seeing the questions on the test, I decided to review this book. While the book definitely deserves it's 2 stars (as opposed to a lower rating), but book will not prepare you to pass the Series 7 exam alone.<br />I personally used this book in conjunction with the Dearborn Passtrak Series 7 exam manual. The Dearborn manual has nearly 1000 pages...Baron's coming in shy of 400 pages just to give an idea of a contrast between this book and the Dearborn. Obviously, it's impossible to condense 1000 pages of already condensed material into 400 pages.<br />Aside from the book being too brief and skirting over general ideas, the book is simply poorly written. My biggest complaint is the fact that the questions seem to have been written by someone that never saw this book in production, in that, the questions can't be answered by reading the chapters. On top of that, the questions are written in a muddled confusing manner that is NOT consistent with the way the REAL Series 7 questions are asked.<br />Overall, this book only helped me round out some rough edges that the Dearborn manual left behind. I didn't need it to pass the exam though and basically wasted my money.<br />You get what you pay for regarding this book. Don't bother with it and just get the Dearborn book.	2003-11-10

Building Left-Brain Power is somewhat of a bittersweet book because of it's inconsistency throughout the entire book. The<br />book begins with \\"easy\\" logic puzzles such as unscrambling words<br />and such and ends with the hardest logic puzzles which are<br />code-breakers.<br />The book provides a preface at the beginning of most chapters<br />to give you help in trying to find a logical way of thinking to<br />tackle a particular problem. This quality I found to be unique<br />and very valuable as opposed to most books with logic puzzles<br />just poured in there and leave you frustrated because you can't<br />figure them out.<br />Here's what's horrible about this book though. There are type-o's<br />in the answer keys (which I was amazed at how terribly obvious<br />they were considering they were not caught before publication). I only spotted two obvious ones though.<br />The other thing that drove me nuts was that there was no logic<br />whatsoever to explaining how they arrived at some of their<br />answers. Many times, I gave other people the problem to look at<br />WITH the answer that I had looked up and asked them to figure<br />out how they came up with that answer...no one knew. Was it<br />another type-o? No clue.<br />This book has some great qualities, and some terrible qualities<br />which I thought averaged it out to a 2.5 star book, however, I<br />rounded up because of the very inexpensive price.	2002-05-05

This book was an absolute joy to read. The book contains information on mnemonics, pegs, etc. This information is not particularly new, or unique to this book. But I've read other books on the subject and have not gotten as much use from it as I have this book.<br />In the first few chapters, you'll already begin to memorize things that you thought couldn't be memorized. I still remember a practice list of random objects in the first couple chapters, with no review or real thought about it since I purchased it back about 2 or 3 years ago (I can't remember when I purchased it, but can still remember the list - ironic, no?).<br />As much as I enjoyed this book and think how much it has helped me...this book did not provide me with solutions to memory issues such as \\"where I placed my keys\\" or \\"where I parked the car\\". However, I have memorized Pi to over 100 digits now using the techniques of this book.<br />Overall, this was a great book, as well as an enjoyable read.

But extremely fundamental concepts.	How to Be Twice as Smart is a book that basically discusses the use of some older techniques that have been developed in the past.<br />Predominating through this book are discussions of antiquated reading techniques such as : only reading the first sentence of every paragraph, using mnemonics to memorize things, and not using vowels when note taking. Don't be fooled into thinking that the book is solely about these topics though. The book covers other topics such as : \\"Refining your listening powers\\", \\"Outwitting your Competitors\\", \\"How to use the Written Word to get what you Want\\", and other interesting topics.<br />This book does a decent job about talking about each of the aforementioned subjects. What makes it get 4 stars instead of something lower, is the fact that it covers such a large array of so many fields, you will have somewhat of a roadmap of what topics you need to study further to get to be particularly good at whatever you want to do.<br />Essentially, this book shows you what's out there so you can focus in better on learning certain things, I just wouldn't rely on this book alone.	2002-03-23

I bought Wade Cook's newest book despite hearing the words of warning from his legion...Pages 1-147 are the meat of the book which contain about 50% of vague testimonials, quotes from famous people, and quips like \\"Image what it's like to be RICH and RETIRE!!\\"The reason the book got two stars and not one deals with the fact that Wade brings up some interesting concepts in option trading. His repeated advice to trade on margin is pure insanity though if your cash funds are limited, but Wade continuously uses this to amplify his rate of return on investments.Also, Wade not only trades on margin, but also with stocks that have option prices that I've never heard of. On Pg.48 he buys shares of JNPR at [$$$] and sells a call right at-the-money for [$$$] with expirations typically only 5-6 months in the future.Those types of premiums are amazing, and I'm very skeptical that they exist, although they might. Perhaps it's my own limited knowledge that I'm not aware of all the option prices in the market. But if anyone finds option premiums that 27% of the underlying asset, please email me.As for the book itself, I think Wade has unrealistic figures, his wealth building seminars are only good for making lawyers wealthy due to Wade constantly being sued, his book is predominately drivel, filler, and promotional material.Although it's an older book, I recommend George Angells : Sure-Thing Stock Options.

But at certain points in this book, Feynman begins to venture off and begin discussing things that are relatively complex and I can't say are really intended for people that don't have a solid background in physics.<br />I personally found myself either thinking his lecture was either too simple (or explained extremely well) or too complex. All in all, I'm not sure who Feynman had in mind for an audience when he gave his lecture, but I would imagine it's for the person that has a solid background in physics and wishes to indulge in some physics \\"brain-candy\\" to think about some extremely interesting concepts.<br />Good book.

I originally wanted to rush through the book to the end only to find that I was very sad that it was all over in \\"just\\" 1008 pages.<br />This particular edition/printing hardback is great. The pages are completely white with a high quality feel to them, whereas the paperback version of this book was quick to have the binding crease and the paper was more of a dingy look to it that is common in many cheaper books. I feel that if you get Lord of the Rings, you're going to be handling it a lot to get through 1000 pages of it, which will make the other paperback editions look quite terrible after you've finished reading it.<br />That is not the case with this edition since it is well bounded and the pages are easy on the eyes.<br />Finally, I rarely see people mention it, but I don't think Tolkein is not for the younger readers simply due to the vocabulary.

While his journey encompasses other places, the story remains essentially the same since the entire book is filled with him talking about everything being so marvelous.<br />Despite John Muir being very well known now to many people I'm left uncertain as to why this man should be one out of so many other 'mountain men' to become famous.<br />His story is filled with rantings about finding different little animals such as squirrels, rabbits, and indians and then peppers each description of the animal with some bantering about whatever it is that he finds extraordinary about it, or whatever he thinks is extremely interesting, or by simply saying such and such is truly amazing.<br />I did however enjoy the peripherial aspects of the book, such as Muir's growing insanity from being isolated in the woods for several months. He starts his journey talking about how he's heard stories of shepards gone mad and how he doesn't really believe he'll go insane. But near the middle of the book, he's put a personality to the plants...by the end, he's having in depth conversations with plants. Ha! It's almost worth reading just for noting little things like that.<br />The book gets 3 stars, as opposed to 1 star, because Muir writes VERY eloquently and if you have an interest and a solid knowledge of plant and animal life and the terrian Muir is traveling, the book is relatively interesting.	2001-12-07

The  book was highly abstract and make you exited all the way until the very end  about going about attaining wealth. However, at the end of the book, you're  left with nothing of substance and you're bombarded by more advertisements  of his products and I can't help but think to myself, 'THIS is how to be  rich.'...ie. selling products about building wealth.<br />I read this book in  about 3 days because it's light reading and you can skim 90% of it since  it's filled with things like &quot;I put down my cup of coffee.

Throughout this book, I noticed myself thinking that I was  receiving good information about beliefs but very little in the  applications of NLP. This book is structured from basically a transcript of  a seminar where the subjects were seemingly psychologists and serve hardly  any true practical value for means of demonstration in how to allow someone  to change their beliefs. What I mean by this is, his subjects immediately  dropped into trance at will and used statments like, &quot;I have an  identity complex with...&quot;...These are statements you're not going to  hear from a typical patient.  Many of the examples he used in changing  peoples beliefs were very vague and you're still left wondering what to do  with all the knowledge you've been given.

This book is a simple read of how a few millionaires acquire wealth. They have an above average income and are incredibly frugal/tight. Now, they can retire better instead of being in poverty.

Trade your way to Fiancial Freedom is an absolutely transcending book on the stock market that leads you into an incredible amount of information that remains terribly succinct. Dr. Tharp introduces the idea that the  &quot;holy grail&quot; of the market, is not in some secret book somewhere  that's hidden and only given to &quot;professionals&quot;, but the holy  grail is inside yourself. Despite this reasonable truth, it still can be a  long journey to find that in yourself and you're likely to return jaded  without the aid of this book.<br />Dr. Tharp takes professionals in different  areas of the market (from T.A. to Arbitrage) to elucidate points  continuously throughout the book to give you an idea of what could be best  for you. He foreshadows his ideas of position sizing until the very last  chapter, which is the only spot where position sizing, TRUE position  sizing, is going to make sense. If you're not using some sort of conscious  position sizing, and Tharp warns that many have a misconception of position  sizing initally anyways, you could be cutting yourself out of tremendous  profits.<br />I recommend this book to anyone investing or considering  investing.

The Pawn of Prophecy is a book that is an excellent read and an instant classic. This book has a detailed story line that spans over the course of 5 books it's current series and then 5 more in the Mallorean Gospels totaling 10 books which all of them are worth reading.	1998-07-26

Universal Mind is a simple book that goes over simple occult principles and explains topics like reading your future from dominos, playing cards, talking to people in their dreams, color healing, healthy eating, and a few other topics. Nothing ground breaking, but still a nice little book for people interested in occult aspects.	1998-07-26

Practical NLP for managers is probably the more  deeply involved NLP book that remains applicable in most everyday situtations. From building  rapport to understanding different company  leadership structures, this book is an excellent buy.	1998-06-28
US	53081064	R14A7J9JSAEB3W	0749914890	747741573	Nlp: Neuro Linguistic Programming the New Art and Science of Getting What You Want	Books	4	18	23	N	Y	Excellent book but deviates from actual NLP practices.	NLP: The new art and science of getting what you want seems to look more into the aspects of the brain management through visualization, goal setting, and simple but very effective tools in life. Despite it portraying these ideas lucidly, the books absolutely fails to deliver any type of substantial art form of NLP and rarely ever mentions persuasion or any aspect of NLP. This book was a good book, but is NOT for the NLP scholar.	1997-10-07

The best book of it's kind that I have seen. A succinct overview of numerous historical sects, traditions, and so fourth from Crowley, the Golden<br />Dawn Tradition, the Gnostics, Simon Magus, and others. This is an excellent book to attain the historical and real points that each of these orders possessed. This book elicits many hidden facts about these people and sects and is excellent for anyone to attain a fundamental study of the various types of occult knowledge there is today in the world. Also demonstrated in this work of art is how most of modern technology came from these profound occultists. From astrologists paving the way to astronomers, to the alchemists developing the steel industry in their futile attempts to change base metals into gold and silver. For other historical books of this kind, check Angel Magic, which is not as clear, but still good.<br />-For further disucssion of this book e-mail me-	1997-07-02
