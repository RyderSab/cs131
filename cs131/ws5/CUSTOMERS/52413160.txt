The editor does a good job on the back cover, in her biographic section, and in the final page, of trying to advertise herself as being not only a \\"genius\\" but \\"rank[ing] on the spine-tingling chart with the masters\\". I beg to disagree.<br /><br />Traditionally, Gothic literature deals with the dark and mysterious and with the tortured soul. I had great difficulty seeing some of these stories as being gothic at all. Some of these stories would better fit the category of \\"tales of the weird\\", but some don't even fit in that category. For example, there's a two-page story of a man leaving his wife and trying to wrest the baby from her arms in the dark. There's another with two men in a spaceship contemplating life. Another is merely a story of someone tripping on drugs.<br /><br />Granted, there are some good gothic and weird stories here. The stories are placed in the book chronologically. Many of the earlier stories are anti-climatic with endings that are little more than a tiny \\"Boo!\\" (if that). Such a story is Oates' own attempt at a gothic story, \\"The Temple\\". Others are page-turners. In trying to put in some more obscure stories, she's left out better ones by the same author. For example, \\"Dr. Heidegger's Experiment\\" would have been a better Gothic literature choice for displaying Nathaniel Hawthorne's talents. And authors like H.P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe, who greatly inspired writers of this genre, should have more inclusions in the book.<br /><br />If this book were to truly be a book of good gothic literature, the following stories would remain (favorites starred): *Brown's exerpt from Wieland, *Irving's \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\", Hawthorne's \\"The Man of Adamant\\" and \\"Young Goodman Brown\\", Poe's \\"The Black Cat\\", Perkin's \\"The Yellow Wallpaper\\", James' The Romance of Certain Old Clothes\\", Bierce's \\"The Damned Thing\\", *Wharton's \\"Afterward\\", Anderson's \\"Death in the Woods\\", *Lovecraft's \\"The Outsider\\", Faulkner's \\"A Rose for Emily\\", Derleth's \\"The Lonesome Place\\", *Jackson's \\"The Lovely House\\", *Cheever's \\"The Enormous Radio\\" (more twilight zone than gothic), *Bradbury's \\"The Veldt\\" (more science fiction than gothic), Doctorow's \\"The Waterworks\\", *L'Heureux's \\"The Anatomy of Desire\\", Oates' \\"The Temple\\", *Rice's \\"Freniere\\", Millhauser's \\"In the Penny Arcade\\", *King's \\"The Reach\\", Johnson's \\"Exchange Value\\" (good but not really gothic), *Crowley's \\"Snow\\", *Ligotti's \\"The Last Feast of the Harlequin\\" (a wonderful story in memory of Lovecraft), *Tuttle's \\"The Replacements\\", *Etchemendy's \\"Cat in Glass\\", and Baker's \\"Subsoil\\".<br /><br />Even though I felt that some of the selections for this anthology  were poor choices, the good selections makes this a worthwhile read. Had she replaced the non-gothic and anti-climatic stories with more good stories by the above authors, the book would have been perfect. I will definitely be looking more into works by some of the authors like Ligotti and Wharton. I will not, on the other hand, be seeking out works by the editor.

Then again, I don't think that the people in my Alabama hometown have changed their mind much about black people since the 1930s when this book was set. The parents of my classmates would have wanted to censor this book for its cuss words and references to sex. Small town Alabama has changed a lot since this book was written in many ways but not at all in others. To quote from the book: \\"You're not gonna change any of them by talkin' right, they've got to want to learn themselves, and when they don't want to learn there's nothing you can do but keep your mouth shut or talk their language.\\" My personal choice was to keep my mouth shut and to get out of there!<br />Harper Lee paints a portrait of small town Alabama with its varying social classes. Below even the class that lives on the outskirts of the city dump is the class of the black people in the town. To Kill A Mockingbird is a story told from the viewpoint of children who had not been tainted with this social phobia and who had learned from their father, Aticus, to view each of these groups equally. Still, their curiosity about these different groups lead them beyond their own imaginations into the real world as they encounter people from each of these social classes. They invite a boy home for lunch who has no lunch of his own, they visit a black church with their housekeeper when their father is away on business, and they try to make contact with the next door neighbor who hasn't been seen for 20 years.<br />Then the children are unexpectedly plunged into world of intolerance where the town's adults live when a black man is accused of a crime he didn't commit. Their father is appointed as the black man's lawyer and the children hide in the balcony to witness the trial first-hand. They are shocked and dismayed by the townspeople's inability to see past the man's skin color to aquit him for his alleged crime. In response to the children's reaction, their black housekeeper says, \\"They've done it before and they'll do it again and when they do it -- seems that only the children weep.\\" How amazingly profound!<br />What a wonderful book!lack housekeeper says, \\"They've done it before and they'll do it again and when they do it -- seems that only the children weep.\\" How amazingly profound!<br />What a wonderful book!	2003-07-13

In the tradition of Saint Teresa of Avila, Sister John is caught up in an ecstatic whirlwind of visions and closeness with her Maker that cause a touch of jealousy among her fellow nuns. However, the sell of her prose and poetry which comes prolithicly with her miraculous experiences helps to support their small Carmelite monastery. Unfortunately, these experiences are accompanied by tremendous and debilitating headaches. With the possibility that the two may be related, Sister John must decide if it's more selfish to rid herself of the headaches or more selfish to keep her ecstatic world intact.<br />I've never met a nun in person. But through the beautiful prose in this novel, I feel as if I've lived among them. I do, however, wonder about the accuracy of the life of the nun as well as the theology that Mark Salzman puts forth in his novel. Some of the things that Sister John feels about the nature of God almost seem Gnostic in nature: &quot;In the fire of his embrace, all that was her ceased to exist. Only what was God remained. 'I AM.' The cloister bell, the voice of Christ. He spoke again: 'I AM.' She tried to obey but was frozen in beauty, like a fly trapped in amber. She could not move. 'NOTHING EXISTS APART FROM ME.' Self had been an illusion, a dream. God dreaming.&quot; Are these thoughts simply a product of Sister John's feeling of union with God or are these thoughts a product of the teachings of the Catholic Church?<br />I did enjoy some of the other thoughts put forth in the novel. I can tell that Mark Salzman is a thinker and a philosopher, and I admire the thought processes that he relays throughout the novel. I especially liked this ponderance from Sister John as she struggles with the possibility of losing her closeness to God if she loses her &quot;Miracle&quot;: &quot;What if I have it all upside down? What if I'm the one who knows nothing of God, &amp; the people in the world are actually interceding on my behalf with their ordinary, daily struggles?&quot;<br />Despite the beauty and depth of this novel on one level, there were three things that were dissatisfactory about this novel. First of all, the author doesn't make it clear enough that Helen and Sister John are the same person. Also, the other nuns' characters are not very well-developed. Lastly, the storyline is easily guessed from the beginning (especially if one knows anything about Saint Teresa of Avila).the world are actually interceding on my behalf with their ordinary, daily struggles?&quot; <br />Despite the beauty and depth of this novel on one level, there were three things that were dissatisfactory about this novel.

The cover artist has painted a colorful picture of an Indian market place, complete with lots of nice green grass. This is definitely a romanticized and wishful picture of India while the real picture of India lies in the name of the book: HEAT AND DUST. If you're planning a trip to India, expect heat and dust.<br />Ruth Prawer Jhabvala has written this book with the most beautiful prose. She doesn't just tell a story; she becomes a part of her story and brings the reader along with her.<br />This short novel takes place mainly in British imperialist India. Olivia is an English wife which is wooed and seduced by a very charasmatic Indian prince during the boring heat of the day while her husband is away at work. The Indian prince, Nawab, seems to cast a spell on everyone around him. People shirk their responsibilities and forsake the ones they love in order to bask in his adoration.<br />When Olivia's step-granddaughter learns of Olivia's romantic adventures in India through old letters, she is determined to go to India and find out all she can about Prince Nawab and the whirlwind affair he had with Olivia. The novel is written from the viewpoint of the step- granddaughter during her time in modern India.<br />Ruth Prawer Jhabvala tempts when she writes. She sets the reader up with a hint of sensual suspense that drives the novel to the end. The reader finishes the novel, satisfied.	2003-06-23

Of course there have been other sleepless nights in this small town, but none until this one have been enchanted.<br />When the people of the town cannot sleep, they wander the streets, thinking that they are alone.  Little do they know that the rest of the town is experiencing the same insomnia and are also wandering through the night.  A girl longs for her beau to come to her lonely window; he does.  A man lusts after a manequin in a window; she comes to life.  The Pied Piper leads the children through the woods with his magic flute.  A girl who decides to moonbathe in the nude is followed by a lusty man and rescued in the nick of time by a guy who lives in his mother's attic.  A band of young female thieves enjoy lemonade in the most unlikely of homes.<br />The night is so fantastical that perhaps it was just a dream.

When they first meet during childhood, Angel falls in love with Lara and never loves anyone else in the same way.  Later, when they are reacquainted as adults, they become roommates and are inseperable and dependent on one another.  The beautiful and alluring Lara sucks those around her into her magnetic aura.  Conversely, Angel attaches herself to those around her that she holds dearest.  Even as Lara struggles with obviously genetic psychological problems, her sensuality and allure to those around her does not diminish.<br />Ruth Prawer Jhabvala tempts when she writes.

Evidently this restaurant must be reached by traveling forward in time to the actual end of the universe. Every night, a big show is made of the big bang that ends the universe. Luckily, the restaurant is protected from the effects and can make a show of it night after night. The only disappointing thing is that Author Dent and his friends miss the show as they attempt to stow away and hitchhike yet another ride in entirely the wrong vehicle.

After I had Lasik surgery on my eyes, I couldn't read for the first week, so I checked out this book-on-tape from the library thinking that if I didn't like her writing, I could just turn off the tape and return it to the library.  However, this collection of stories was brilliant.  Also, Kate Binchy is a wonderful reader.  She pauses at all the right moments to allow you to ponder what you've just heard.<br />LONDON TRANSPORTS is a collection of 22 stories that you'll want to ravenously devour.  The stories seem to be just a page in someone's life.  However, they leave a lasting impression on your mind.  The twist in the stories are not the conventional type; the twist is the way that the character thinks and handles the situations that are thrown at them.<br />Some of the more memorable stories includes a 28-year-old virgin who goes to a sex shop to find a manual for people who've never had sex.  Because she's embarrassed, she says that she's a nun looking for information for her 28-year-old virgin neice.  Another story has a young woman looking for an apartment and finding an amazing apartment belonging to Marigold, a wheelchair-ridden gold-digger.  But the apartment is so amazing that the young woman doesn't care that Marigold may take everything that has ever belonged to her.<br />Maeve Binchy has a gift for painfully realistic character creation.  I imagine her sitting on park benches and making up stories about the people who walk by her.  One thing that struck me as odd is that almost every story assumes that everyone in London is having an extra-marital affair.  Maybe I'm naive to think and hope that this isn't based in reality.  However, according to an Irish co-worker who happens to be a distant cousin of Maeve Binchy, Maeve and her husband live in separate countries.  What does this mean about their own fidelity?  I can only guess.<br />I'll definitely be reading more of Binchy's works after this.  I can hardly wait to start.this.  I can hardly wait to start.	2003-06-08

It was also used as the basis of the movie, The Emperor's Club.  The story has the same feel as Dead Poet's Society with a professor that gets his students to dress in togas as they study Greek history and literature.  The story is good but, in my opinion, the only true gem in the palace of this book.<br />Ethan Canin likes to infuse his stories with baseball and other diversions enjoyed by men.

Each \\"exhibit\\" carries with it a history and a memory that the casual onlooker cannot fathom.  Some people, like Ruby Lennox, feel that \\"the past is what you leave behind in life\\".  However, others, like Patricia Lennox, feel that \\"the past is what you take with you\\".  You decide.  Can you really understand the past by simply viewing an object or are most museums (the real type and the kind you might have in your home) full of objects that are unable to tell their stories without an all-knowing narrator?<br />This book follows the life of Ruby Lennox from conception onward:  \\"I exist!  I am conceived to the chimes of midnight on the mantelpiece in the room across the hall.\\"  From this intriguing beginning, the book draws you in.  You immediately fall in love with Ruby, her flustered mother Bunty, and her quirky English family.  Each chapter that takes place in the present generation of the Lennox family mentions an \\"exhibit\\" item from the \\"Lennox family museum.\\"  These are listed as footnotes.  However, the footnote takes you to the next chapter where you learn a bit of Lennox family history surrounding the exhibit item.  For example, the pink daisy-shaped button (the above Exhibit A) popped off of Alice Barker's dress only a few days before she \\"died giving birth\\" to Ruby's grandmother.  It was later found and kept in a button box for years before Ruby's sister found it.<br />A lot of family secrets are bound up in the exhibits of the \\"Lennox family museum\\".  One in particular deals with the death of Ruby's mysteriously unmentioned sister.  Another deals with the father of an unmarried family member's child.  Still another deals with the identity of the mysterious late-night phone caller that never says a word.  Every family has its secrets and the author is careful not to give enough hints to give away the family secrets until the end of the book.<br />I simply loved this book.  A fellow book-lover suggested that I read it.  I was not disappointed.  The characters were colorful and the author keeps up a certain level of suspense throughout the novel.

Because the story is absolutely wonderful. CORALINE has a magical and whimsical quality that makes it absolutely scrumptious. I love the way that I was able to pick up this book, be finished reading it in an hour, and feel absolutely satisfied afterwards. Although this is a book written with children in mind, it is quite enjoyable for adults. I think that the allure of children's books is that they take you to a world outside of the hum-drum of everyday life. While CORALINE is a little on the scarey and weird side, it definitely does take you to a strange world behind a curious door in Coraline's new house. At first, everything behind the door seems to be a mirror of the life on the other side of the door. However, there are just a few changes that tempt her to stay in the other world rather than in her own. For example, in the other world, her other mother can actually cook a decent meal. Her other room is painted beautiful colors and her other toys seem to be alive. Of course, it was too good to be true and Coraline's escape from the other world of button-eyed people takes quite a bit of courage.<br />Neil Gaiman is a master storyteller. He has written a story in our own time that is destined to be a classic for years to come. Luckily, he writes books for adults as well. This is the type of book that I absolutely must hold on to so that I can read it to my children oneday (when I finally every do have children).	2003-05-15

I don't think I've ever given a book one star.  I would have given it negative stars if possible.  I listened to the book on tape and the selling point was that Kevin Spacey (the actor) was the one reading the the book.  Since I always enjoy the movies Kevin Spacey acts in, I thought that I'd enjoy a book he narrated.  Not so.  The book is about a professor that gets the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to travel to the United Kingdom to do research on his favorite author who, I believe, is a relative of his.  He is chosen as the privileged professor for that year who gets to stay in this enormous mansion and use their one-of-a-kind library.  Things get a little weird.  He rents a car from the airport and encounters strange people along the way.  And when he finally gets to the mansion, the people living there are even stranger.  You've got mysterious figures in windows, cobwebbed passageways, and a room full of dozens of miniature replicas of the mansion.  The description of the book sounds interesting and eerie enough, but the author is confusing.  He adds elements to the story that make no sense.  You go over a passage in the book and go over it again without being able to figure out what in the world the author is trying to say.  Is it fact or fantasy?  What actually happened?  Did anything happen?  Where did the concentration camp people come from and what do they have to do with anything?  What's the story about the mysteriously dying children mean?  I suppose it's supposed to be a ghost/horror story.  And I suppose that the author knew what he was talking about in his own mind, but he is unable to put pen to paper and make the story make sense to the reader.  It seems as if the author got tired of writing and decided to resolve everything all at once so that he could leave this mess of a book behind him.  Maybe he should have just stopped completely.	2003-05-10

Back in 1915 when HERLAND was written, women were widely considered weak and uncreative and had the sole responsibility of taking care of home, family, and being socialites. So, when 3 young American men in the novel encounter a country comprised entirely of women, they look everywhere to find out where they must have hidden their men. Of course, being emperialist men, they think it should be easy to conquer and subdue a country of women. However, they are looking at these \\"women\\" through the eyes of their own culture, not realizing their full potential as \\"humans\\". These are women who have such little land to support their people that they've only kept and cultivated food-bearing trees like most people would cultivate a garden and who have learned how to have children without men. Some women! Charlotte Perkins Gilman wrote this novel after leaving her own husband and home, going off to prove that women are as capable as making a living for themselves as men are. I can only imagine the stir this book must have caused among the feminists of the day. Gilman has written a very interesting book with only one minor flaw. She keeps on building the reader up to this \\"big thing\\" that the women of Herland evidently have in store for the men who have dropped by bi-plane into their perfect little world. It turns out to not be such a shocking thing after all and pretty obvious in fact. Despite this slight transgression, the book is superb. HERLAND is a short book that is surprisingly quick-paced and imaginative. It's a gem of a book to add to anyone's collection.	2003-05-06

ATONEMENT by Ian McEwan is such a book.  From the beginning to end, I was enraptured by McEwan's writing.  Briony, the little girl that greets the reader on the first page, is definitely me as a child in every way down to her pudgy knees (see the front cover of the paperback edition).  Just like Briony, I was constantly writing stories and plays and hiding things in secret compartment around my room.  Fantasy was more real than reality.  When innocent young Briony finally decides that real life could be more interesting than her fantasy world, she goes a little too far too fast.  And the scarey part is that I can picture myself accidently committing Briony's crime.  It's Briony's crime and search for atonement from that crime that is the catalyst for the rest of the story.<br />Ian McEwan makes his characters and history come to life.  He touches the marrow of human existence and breaks it down to it's basest form.  You have something in common with these characters simply in your humanity.  And even if the characters aren't as much like you as Briony is like me, you will find yourself running alongside Robbie in the French countryside in World War II, hiding as planes bomb the roadway from above.  And you feel the immediacy and tenderness of Briony as she nurses broken soldiers back to health almost wishing you could help them somehow, too.<br />The ending is quite interesting.  Without giving it away in the least, I can say that Briony has finally learned where and when fact and fantasy are most appropriate.  When I reached the end of this novel I was determined to read every novel ever written by Ian McEwan.  This novel is truly one of the best I've ever read.  Although some people have difficulty getting into the book, I was throughly engrossed from beginning to end.  I wanted to re-read what I'd just read rather than go onward and come to the end of this magnificent book.	2003-05-06

Two people will fall in love and have a passionate romance.<br />2.  The romance will last a lifetime, but end suddenly.<br />3.  Even though you know these two things and have a hunch how the story will end, you still want to savor the story in between.<br />Once again, Nicholas Sparks has written a beautiful novel with the perfect setting.  Two strangers end up spending a weekend alone at a bed and breakfast on the East Coast during a hurricane.  They, of course, find the love of their lives in each other and have one blissful weekend together before they have to go back to their respective lives waiting for them on the other side of the magical weekend.<br />This is a great weekend read because of its short length and ability to draw you into it.

I would figure out this or that way and run it down through my head until it got easy.\\" I think that I'm still swishing this book around in my mouth trying to figure out what it tastes like (not molasses, maybe butter?). It's a short book (only 126 pages), so maybe I read it too quickly to digest it properly.<br />There are two things that seem to make this book a candidate for Oprah's Book Club. First of all, ELLEN FOSTER is the story of a poor southern girl who is able to overcome the obstacles presented by her abusive family. Secondly, the book centers around the friendship between a black and a white girl. In between, you learn that Ellen loves to read and is extremely smart. She certainly outsmarts (and outlives) those people who never showed her the love she deserved.<br />Since I'm originally from the southern US (southern Alabama to be exact), I looked for similarities to the way of life I recall in the deep south. I truly identified with the friendship that Ellen had with her black friend, Starletta. When I was 6, I became friends with a little black girl and was completely ostracized from the other people in my class because of my friendship with her. Unfortunately, she died in a house fire when we were 7. In ELLEN FOSTER, Ellen also has no friends except for her black friend. And she doesn't care what other people think about it (even though she is still concerned with drinking from a glass at Starletta's house and getting \\"black germs\\").<br />I'm still having difficulty with some of the details of the story, though. The author never says outright what decade the story is written in. However, it has to be after the 60's and before the 90's. I was surprised to find black people picking cotton in ELLEN FOSTER. Machines do that now and have been doing the cotton picking for years in the south. Also, I was surpised at the familiarity that Ellen Foster uses with her elders. She calls people by their first name rather than adding the requisite Ms. or Mr. in front of their name. However, the part of the book I had the most difficulty believing was the backwoods, hick English that Ellen uses in telling her story. Even though I grew up in the rural south, my vocabulary and speech pattern developed quite differently because of the multitude of books I read as a child. This should be evident in Ellen's speech, as it is evident in most well-read southerners I know.<br />I was impressed, however, with Ellen's spunk. She knows what she wants and is determined to make it happen. At 10 years old, she is mature beyond her years. Ellen had such an unlucky beginning that I expected a sad ending. Amazingly enough, she gets all she ever wished for in the end. And that's the way life should be, right?rs in the south.

However, I soon forgave the author my pet-peeve since this is a common trait of Ursula Hegi's first language, German.  As I read on, I realized that these long sentences created a beautiful poetic cadence in the book that made the book almost melodic.<br />The main character in the story is a German \\"zwerg\\" woman (a midget) named Trudi.  The reader gets to see the inner and hidden thoughts of the \\"zwerg\\" woman as well as her longings to have a lover and a child of her own.  When she finally does experience a beautiful romance, she keeps it a secret because it seems like something from a dream.  To shift people's thoughts from her differences, Trudi spreads stories about all the townspeople through her gossip at the pay library that she and her father owns.  STONES FROM THE RIVER takes place before and during World War II in a small German town.  Through Trudi's acquaintances with the townspeople, the author introduces the reader to the characters in the town.  Thus, the reader gets a sense of how people reacted as Hitler spread his propoganda throughout Germany.  Some people, like Trudi and her father, hid Jews in their homes or were punished for showing kindess to them.  Others spouted hate and turned against their neighbors to hopefully save their own lives.  People felt pressure to join clubs and wear the colors of the party even when they did not agree with what the party was doing (although some actually did agree).  The children were fed with so much propaganda in their schools that they often turned their own parents in for not being loyal to the party without understanding what they were doing.<br />This was definitely an insightful book and not soon to be forgotten.  The author fills the book with so many characters and small stories about each of them that I did sometimes find myself confused when a character would suddenly resurface and I couldn't remembering what happened to that character 200 pages back when they were 10 years younger.  I should have written downs the characters' names and something about them as I went along.  There were times when I couldn't put the book down, times that I laughed, and times that I wanted to cry.  All in all, it was a great find and highly recommended to others.happened to that character 200 pages back when they were 10 years younger.

Reading it was a guilty pleasure.  I knew I was going to enjoy reading Fara's  book when I saw the quote from her mother:  \\"I always worried about Fara, locking herself up in her room for hours, making up lies and writing them down.  It's a bit shameful if you ask me.  Hope something good comes of this.\\"  And it did!  What a wonderfully inventive book!<br />THAT HURT THING is the story of a young man named Nick who finds a curious book in a used bookstore.  He is immediately drawn to it's foil cover emblazoned with a scorpion and tulip and to it haunting prose inside.  He becomes obsessed with the book and follows the directions within to procure a beautiful seductress and genie named Lyra.  As with your average genie, Lyra sets out to fulfill three wishes for Nick.  Unfortunately for Nick, Lyra is pure evil and fills his life with nothing but living nightmares.<br />Fara uses beautiful detail in her writing.  It's just enough detail to make you feel like you're in the book, but not so much that you want to skip paragraphs.  The book is very dark book and Lyra is the embodiment of evil.  I did find myself having a weird nightmare after reading one of the strange, spacey dreams Nick has in the book under Lyra's influence.  Regardless, I could not put the book down for long and found myself reading at speeds I've never before reached so that I could finish it before the sun peaked back up over the horizon.  I can't wait to read Fara's next book.	2003-04-02

It's not necessarily the setting or the story itself. God knows I wanted the people in the story to leave the dying, small town of Empire Falls and never look back. I felt sorry for the characters that couldn't divorce themselves from the selves they were back in high school and learn from their pasts. But it's the colorful characters in the town of Empire Falls that keeps people from leaving Empire Falls, and it's the colorful characters in the novel that brought it to it's award-winning status.<br />You meet Miles who runs the Empire Grill and lets life happen to him without much active reaction. He stands in stark contrast to his father, a man who is always trying to borrow \\"a few bucks to get down to Florida\\" or \\"buy a drink\\" and then he'll \\"leave you alone\\". You want Horace to take care of the huge cyst on his forehead (but you'll never say anything to him about it because Horace just wouldn't be Horace without that huge cyst on his forehead). Then there's John Voss whose parents used to put him in a laundry bag and tie him to the doorknob while they did drugs -- you know THAT must have messed with his mind (and, boy did it ever)! Oh, and how can you forget the all-knowing Mrs. Whiting who practically owns the town and knows everyone kind of -- well -- kind of like god. And Father Tom who has gone senile and likes to call people [names]. And lets not forget Charlene with the big [bosom] and Janine who runs off with the Silver Fox. Yeah, these are the characters that suck the reader into the book and keep people from leaving the town of Empire Falls.<br />It's unfortunate that these characters don't change. Oh, they try to change. Janine loses weight, has an affair with the owner of the gym, and discovers orgasms. But she doesn't really CHANGE -- she's still the same Janine. Miles goes off to college to escape Empire Falls, but then he returns to cook in the same restaurant he worked at in high school. The author shows that sometimes people don't change because they don't make the effort, but sometimes they don't change because they're trying to be something that they're not. I think that it's the author's pessimism about the ability of people to change that keeps me from liking the book more. I really wanted to talk some sense into the characters in the book sometimes.<br />Yes, it's worth the read. The characters are memorable and you'll often find yourself laughing out loud. There are lots of small and memorable episodes throughout the book. During the final section of the book, I was unable to put it down.

Some pages only have a few words, others are written upside down, others have inset squares of blue. An appendix has strange pictures, sketchings, and writings. The cover itself contains a strange collage. The book looks disturbing and at the same time enticing. So, when I found it at a used book sale for next to nothing, I had to get it. And boy was I in for a wild adventure! This is the type of book that you can get lost in -- really get lost in. Maybe you'll never make it back out quite the same way as when you entered.<br />So the story begins. Johnny goes plundering through the belongings of a dead blind man and stumbles upon a pile of papers. The papers appear to be research collected about a film documentary of a house that is larger on the inside than it is on the outside. It documents the journey made into the dark labyrinth of the house and the affects it had on the people who ventured into it.² Johnny's life becomes a wild roller coaster ride as he reads these papers. Although he can't find any proof that the \\"house on Ash Tree Lane\\" and it's \\"five-minute hallway\\" ever really existed, he gets caught up in its power. HOUSE OF LEAVES is a haunting tale of genius and not a story quickly forgotten.

I stepped right into Mercy Goodwell's kitchen and couldn't wait for her Malvern pudding to be done so that I could try it.  I wanted to be one of the tourists looking at the tower that newly wed Cuyley Goodwill built to memorialize his wife.  I wanted to touch the intricately and lovingly carved pictures and words on the stones of the tower.<br />THE STONE DIARIES is the story of the life of Daisy Goodwill.  The first chapter is told in first-person in Daisy's own words.  But the rest of the story (although told in third-person) seems to be written by her as well.  Every person in the life of Daisy Goodwell is three-dimensional; you can almost reach out and touch them.  Daisy, however, is the very person that she dreads becoming -- a person remembered for what happened TO her rather than WHO she is.  The explanation would go something like this:  \\"Daisy Goodwell?  You remember her.  Don't you?  She's the one who's mother didn't know she was pregnant and died in childbirth.  And her first husband was tragically killed on their honeymoon.\\"  Upon finishing the book, you feel that you know ABOUT Daisy, but you really don't seem to know HER.  The author has been so kind as to supply black and white photographs of all the other characters in the book.  But where's Daisy?  Is she the person on the front cover?<br />You can tell from the table of contents that this is going to be the story of the life -- from birth to death -- of Daisy Goodwell.  Carol Shields shows her genius, however, by making the main character disappear from her own life story!  And that Is the plot:  the life of Daisy Goodwell and her absence therein.  I read this book over the course of one day.  It was extremely satisfying.  I look forward to reading more books by this author.	2003-02-15

His father objects, but Siddhartha refuses to move from the spot he is standing on until his father allows him to go or he dies (whichever comes first). With a sad heart, his father, seeing Siddhartha's determination, allows him to go. Siddhartha's friend and \\"disciple\\", Govinda, follows him to live with the samanas in the forest, fasting or begging for alms from the people. From the samanas, Siddhartha learns how to empty himself of worldly desires and to lose himself to become one with the world around him. However, this does not satisfy him.<br />When the Buddha comes to their area, Govinda convinces Siddhartha to go hear what he has to say. Although, the Buddha speaks truth, Siddhartha says, \\"'But one thing this doctrine, so clear, so venerable, does not contain: it does not contain the secret of what the Sublime One himself experienced, he alone among the hundreds of thousands.'\\" Siddhartha says that \\"'This is why I am continuing my wanderings -- not to seek another, better doctrine, because I know there is none, but to leave behind all teachings & all teachers, and either to attain my goal alone or to die.'\\"<br />Govinda stays to become a disciple of the Buddha while Siddhartha sets out to attain enlightenment on his own terms. Finally, he comes to the realization that he has spent his life trying to escape the world and himself. Now, he seeks to find himself. He says, \\"'I shall no longer be instructed by the YOGA VEDA or the ATHARVA VEDA, or the ascetics, or any other doctrine whatsoever. I shall learn from myself, be a pupil of myself, the mystery of Siddhartha.'\\" At this point \\"[h]e look[s] around as if he [is] seeing the world for the first time.\\" And, although, he leaves all formal teachings & teachers behind, the people and experiences he encounters on his journey through life continue to teach him.<br />The story of Siddhartha is the story that many of us live. We follow after various teachings and doctrines. And, eventually, we open our mind to \\"see the world for the first time\\" through our own eyes. I could relate to Siddhartha's spiritual journey up to a certain point; this could be the story of my own spiritual journey.

Jane Rosenal finds herself in several meaningful relationships throughout life.  Jamie just doesn't work out.  Her relationship with Archie, a man 28 years older than her, ends twice.  Although they're great guys, they just don't fit.  Unhappy with singlehood, she decides to read one of those self-help books that offers dating advice and requires you to be everything but yourself in order to &quot;catch&quot; the guy.  But what happens when the guy you catch has fallen in love with the real you rather than self-helped and contrived you?<br />During the first part of the book, Jane seems to be a little shallow.  The characters seem as if they are on perpetual vacation -- sailing, swimming, playing tennis, being leisurely. The characters have a kind of upper-class snobbery behind their words and actions.  As the book progresses, Jane moves out of this upper-class snobbery world.  However, she still seeks out people like Archie who belong to that world.  By the end of the book, Jane has realized what makes her happy and who she really is.<br />The book is written with a creative play on character voice.  The majority of the book is written from the first-person viewpoint of Jane.  However, a whole chapter (which seems misplaced to me) is written from the first-person viewpoint of Rita, Jane's aunt and seems to be written in the past.  When Jane battles a serious illness, the story is written in a spiraling and detached second-person.  And, in yet another part of the book, Jane carries on conversations in her head with the writers of the unhelpful self-help book as if they are on the date with her, giving her advice.<br />The author seems to develop as a writer over the course of the novel.  Her next book will probably be better.  Other than the stray chapter that doesn't seem to belong to the book and the shallow characters at the beginning, The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing is a nice story.  But, truthfully, the last chapter could stand alone and tell the story beautifully., The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing is a nice story.

We live in a consumer's world -- a world with 100 different types of shampoo to choose from.  And we buy, not the best, but the best advertised.  Are we even able to think for ourselves anymore, or are we becoming a slave to the degenerating devices of modernity?<br />SHAMPOO PLANET is set in the early '90s.  The small town of Lancaster, Washington, is beginning to shrivel into near-oblivion after the \\"plants\\" close down.  The once-rich now live in RVs, stripped of their wealth.  No one has a job, but no one leaves. The mall only has a few stores left open.  The town is dying.<br />The past seems more promising than the future, so Tyler leaves the town in search of the past.  He travels around Europe, only to find that the young people there have become complacent and content to party by night and take jobs as civil servants by day.  History seems more exciting and progressive than the impending future of Generation Xers.<br />Tyler returns to Lancaster but then leaves again in search of his own past.  He travels to the small island in Canada where he was born in a commune to hippie parents.  All that is left to suggest that the island was once inhabited is a crumbling stone chimney.  All other signs of human habitation have rusted and rotted, returning to the earth.<br />He then travels to California to seek his fortune.  Like everyone else around him, he struggles to make it and finds himself only a-day-at-a-fast-food-restaurant away from being on the streets.  He's working just to survive so that he can go back to work another day.<br />Coupland sees a future where consumerism leads to shallow existence.  Perhaps we are regressing back to a a new series dark ages rather than progressing.  Here's a bit of food-for-though from the book:...P>Coupland has, once again, written a witty and thought-provoking novel that gives a candid and un-romanticized view of what the present looks like and where it could be leading us.

The characters are all three-dimensional and memorable.  It's a sweet and pleasurable book that even has home cooking dessert recipes at the end.	2003-02-07

The pages literally crumbled as I turned them, but I couldn't put the book down.  I was enthralled with the life of Oscar Wilde.  Now, this biography isn't one written years after the subject's death from scraps of information.  No.  This is written by a very close friend of Wilde's, Frank Harris.  In being written by someone of such closeness, it lends credence to the harsh words the author had to say of Wilde.  Harris calls him lazy and slothenly.  Of course, Wilde caused quite a sensation in his time.  He was imprisoned under other pretenses, but mainly because he was a homosexual in a time period when this was not acceptable.  Oscar was one who did not care what others thought of him.  He was determined to live a life of pleasure and to make money doing things that he liked:  writing and speaking.  However, he did a great deal of leaching off of others.  There's no denying Wilde's genius.  I have yet to read any of his works except for a short essay entitled \\"The Soul of Man Under Socialism.\\"  To me, the thoughts seemed profound.  But Harris says that Oscar never said or wrote anything original; he merely took other people's thoughts, meshed them together, and said them in a more profound way.  This is a biography that reads like a fine story.  Harris is a great writer and has more first-hand knowledge of his subject than any other biographer that I've read.  I'd reccomend this book to others without reservation.	2003-02-03

He describes her as being a &quot;larger woman&quot; (something she never thought of herself as).  She begins to go to &quot;fat classes&quot; to lose weight.  She begs for Bruce to take her back.  After all, she was the one that said she thought they needed &quot;a break&quot;.  Instead, he continues to put his thoughts on display to America in his magazine column and starts dating another woman.  Cannie is a funny and lovable character.  As i read this book, I pictured the author (picture on back cover) as the main character.  And I wasn't far off.  This is definitely a case of an author writing a wish-fullfilment book.  The story began taking small cues from the author's own life:  she dumped a boyfriend only to want him back only to find that he'd found someone new already.  A friend of mine who also read GOOD IN BED said that some of the story seemed to be unlikely to happen in real life.  But, hey, this is fiction!  Fiction doesn't have to resemble what is most likely to take place.  It can resemble the &quot;what-ifs&quot; of life.  For example, Cannie becomes best friends with a movie star and is whisked off to California to spend time with her.  This, too, came from the author's daydream:  WHAT IF the author hadn't been stood up for that interview and became best friends with the movie star instead?  The main character, Cannie, says all those smart things that the author couldn't come up with until hours later in real life.  The character is blessed with what the author only daydreamed had been the real life outcome.  The story has a satisfying conclusion and is satisfying throughout.  The characters were all 3-demensional and lovable and I had difficulty putting the book down.	2003-02-02

But after the first hundred pages or so, I still could not get interested in the book.<br />The basis for the novel is promising:<br />REGENERATION is the story of the English poet, Siegfried Sassoon, and his time spent in an insane asylum during World War I. Sassoon was committed for making a declaration that the war was \\"being deliberately prolonged by those who have the power to end it\\". His objection to the war was not based on religious or pacifist reasons but because the war had come to a point of being pointless to continue.<br />I kept on waiting for the book to take me somewhere.  It did not.  The novel plods on and on and on with no apparant plot other than Sassoon being in a war hospital for mental patients. There's no suspense, no real storyline, just people being and doing and saying.  The book concerns the case histories of various men in the mental hospital.  However, each of these characters are based on the real stories told in Sassoon's poetry.  So, I suppose that the reason that I had difficulty distinguishing between characters was that their viewpoints were all based on the original viewpoints of the same man: Sassoon.<br />There was only one small storyline in the novel that seemed to be come alive to me -- a small love story of sorts.  However, the love story ended abruptly as if the author got bored with it.<br />This book was recommended to our book club by someone who said that this book had changed her life. So, obviously, some people have truly loved this book. The author even made it into a trilogy. But this bookworm won't be continuing the series . . . even if one of the books in the trilogy did win a Booker award.	2003-01-23

The first of which is the insect portion of the book:  MORPHO EUGENIA.  The second of which is angel portion of the book:  THE CONJUGIAL ANGEL.  Both have surprise endings and both concern themselves with two different forms of societally forbidden loves.  MORPHO EUGENIA is definitely the best of the two.  Evidently, the movie based on the book only contains this story and leaves out the other.  However, the purchase of the book was worth it for the value of the first story.  Below is a short description of each novella:<br />MORPHO EUGENIA - ***** (5 stars)<br />Things are not what they seem.  William Adamson returns from the far reaches of the Amazon only to be castaway at sea and lose most of his precious insect collections.  He and only the rarest of his insect collection (always kept close at hand) are recovered and now find themselves to reside in a Gothic English<br />mansion.  Upon his arrival, he meets the beautiful Eugenia of whom he brashly writes in his journal:  \\"I shall die if I cannot have her.  I shall die if I cannot have her.  I shall die if I cannot have her.\\"  He woos her with a cloud of butterflies and gets his wish, coming to reside with her family in the Gothic mansion.  To pass his time and earn his keep, he categorizes Eugenia's father's various exotic collections.  Becoming bored with this, he helps the children's teacher, Matty Compton, with various science experiments for the children.  The chiefest of these is an elaborate study of local ant colonies.  Things are not what they seem.  William begins to see harrowing parrallels in the insect world he observes and his own world.  Things are definitely not what they seem.<br />THE CONJUGIAL ANGEL - ** (2 stars)<br />This is mainly the story of the intense grieving of three people over loved men lost at sea.  Mrs. Papagay morns Arturo and never marries again.  Emily and her brother, Alfred Tennyson, morn the Arthur immortalized in Tennyson's poems.  The two women, Mrs. Papagay and Emily, spend many hours at seances, hoping to come in contact with the spirits of their long-lost loves.  The surprise ending is very sweet, but not worth wading through the rest of the story.  This second novella was immensely difficult to become interested in and to follow.  The author, in trying to be historical, refers to too many different characters and uses different names for the characters at random.  In fact, I had nearly completed the story before I realized that Emily Tennyson and Emily Jesse were one and the same.  The storyline also incorporates lots of poetry that, truly, doesn't seem to fit in with the text.The two women, Mrs. Papagay and Emily, spend many hours at seances, hoping to come in contact with the spirits of their long-lost loves.

She creates words, creates grammar, creates poetry with her writing. The book is written like a memory of an event: events from childhood are remembered next to the ones from last year with equal value. Thus, her narrative jumps around in time, making the book, at times, difficult to follow. Her writing is genius, but her presentation doesn't necessarily keep the reader interested until the end. After page 100, I still wasn't sure what the book was about. Also, I didn't feel a connection with the characters. While they are well-developed, the author does not make a warm connection between the reader and the characters in the book. However, this book did win the Booker Prize. And it is memorable.<br />After a rocky beginning, this first-time-author became a better writer as she went along and will probably dazzle us with her next book.	2002-12-30

One day Offred goes to buy a pack of cigarettes at a corner store to find that her credit card (cash is no longer legal tender) does not work.  She gets to work and is fired from her job, as are all the other women there.  In Washington, someone has gunned down the president and congress.  Martial law is established and the constitution is suspended.  While fleeing to Canada to escape the reality of awful rumors, Offred and her family are captured and separated.  Due to recent nuclear accidents, many people have become sterile and, this is the new \\"Gileadean government's\\" attempt to ensure a continuation of the population.  People are stripped of their freedoms and women like Offred are forced to perform as handmaidens to supply the barren wives of commanders with children.  The handmaid's sole purpose is now for childbearing.  Women are no longer allowed to read, wear makeup, or even use lotion.  The new government bases its actions on words from the Bible.  However, Offred remembers the words they quote \\"from the Bible\\" as having different lines.  But, without the right to read, she cannot prove this.  This is the story of Offred and her terrifying new world.  May it remain fiction forever!  Atwood has created a new and frightful culture in her book.  THE HANDMAID'S TALE is, by far, the best book I have read to date.  Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down except to sleep.  This is one of those books that the author will probably never be able to top.  Wow!  It can be compared to Brave New World or 1984 for it's eerie view of a possible and horrifying future.  This book should be required reading for everyone.	2002-12-20

He has an amazing knack for storytelling.  It was evident that he had a plan in mind when he began writing the book rather than just letting the story meander without purpose like some authors are prone to do.  This is the story of a boy named Haroun who tries to help his father, a storyteller, regain his ability to tell stories.  His father had always told him that his storytelling abilities came from something called the \\"Sea of Stories\\".  Haroun was surpised to find that this was, in fact a real sea located on the earth's elusive 2nd moon.  Haroun travels there and is acquainted with magnificent characters such as the Water Genie, the flying mechanical bird the Hoopoe, the Shadow Warrior (who's shadow has a personality of it's own), Pages that look like pages.  The book wouldn't be complete without a villain:  Kattam Shud.  It's the age-old story of good versus evil with a new twist.  It's also a fanciful explanation of where good stories come from and how good stories get tainted.  The book is quick-paced and can be read in 3 to 4 short sittings.  It's not so much suspenseful as it is refreshing and enjoyable.  However, why does Rushdie use apostrophes instead of quotation marks during dialogue?	2002-12-18

The story takes place on an island near the state of Washington. Ishmael and Hatsue have an innocent first kiss at the age of 10 as Ishmael shows Hatsue the ocean floor through a glass-bottomed box. The two children spend their adolencent years together exploring the island, playing in the cedar forrest, and picking strawberries together in the summers.<br />Their friendship turns into a secret romance during their teenage years after they seek refuge from the rain in a hollowed out cedar log. They know that they cannot let the world know of their love for each other because of the disapproval the world would have of a relationship between a Japanese and American.<br />Their relationship comes to a close when World War II begins and Hatsue is forced to leave the island and go to a war camp for Japanese-Americans. When she returns, she is married to a Japanese man and Ishmael is crushed.  The book begins with a murder trial in which her Japanese husband is the murder suspect. When Ishmael finds evidence that could clear Hatsue's husband's name, he has the choice to reveal it or keep it to himself. If Hatsue's husband is executed, perhaps he could have Hatsue to himself again.<br />David Guterson is a writer of the finest caliber. He has the ability to draw the reader into the book.

He wasn't afraid to just take hold of an idea and develop it beyond normal reckoning. During a time when science did not provide the answers people sought, philosophers provided their own answers. Timaeus begins with a dialogue discussing the perfect society and if it ever could or ever did exist. It goes on into a dialogue of how god created man with relation to the four elements (earth,wind,fire, and water). He tries to answer questions about why we get sick and the nature of colors. Critias is devoted entirely to Plato's tale of the lost Atlantis which was \\"as large as Asia & Libya combined\\" -- not quite a city, but a continent. He begins by telling that Poiseidon had 5 sets of twin boys (with a human mother). He set these boys as the rulers of different cities in Atlantis. The capital was fortified by concentric rings of water and land that were only later connected by bridges. Plato says that Critias had heard the story of Atlantis from his grandfather, who had heard it from Salon, who had in turn heard it from his travels in Egypt. There is the possibility that Plato's rendition of the Atlantis story was based in reality, but probably as trumped up as other versions of the story. This book is great at the beginning and the end, but the middle section is so full of obviously scientifically inaccurate information that it's difficult to keep turning the pages to get to \\"the good part\\" about Atlantis.	2002-12-14

For years, Haroun's father has told him that the wonderful stories came from drinking water from \\"the Sea of Stories\\".  A faucet for this water (invisible to the naked eye) is installed exactly 6 inches above the basin of the sink.  However, this seemed to be yet another fanciful story.  Upon a chance run-in with his father's Water Genie, Haroun finds that the \\"Sea of Stories\\" does actually exist on the earth's second moon (that has eluded detection by being very fast).  He goes on an amazing adventure to this second moon in search of a way to restore his father's ability to tell stories.  This moon is full of colorful characters like the Shadow Warrior (who's shadow has a personality of it's own), the flying Hoopoe, Pages who are actually shaped like pages, and an ugly princess with a doting fianc.  And the story wouldn't be complete without a villain:  Khattam-Shud.  The story that Rushdie tells is the classic story of good versus evil (with a refreshing twist).  It's a story about stories.  The book is tightly crafted; everything has meaning.  This was the first Rushdie book that I have read, and I vow to read more.  He writes with beautiful simple prose.  Although not suspenseful, this book was highly readable.  It is pleasurable for it's simplicity and well-told story.  It can easily be read in 3 to 4 short sittings.  HAROUN & THE SEA OF STORIES is destined to be a classic.	2002-12-14

The dangers and perils are not so grand, and the form that Prince Ombra takes isn't very fantastical.  The idea behind the story was interesting, but it could have been developed better.

She is continuously searching for a thread that binds them all together.  But she's also convinced that many people reinterpret their NDEs to fit their commonly held beliefs of life after death:  angels, religious figures, life reviews, etc.  Joanna becomes a partner in a medical experiment that chemically induces NDEs and eventually, because of lack of quality volunteers, begins to undergo the chemically induced NDEs herself.  Her exciting NDE adventures in the other world her brain creates lead her to amazing discoveries about the purpose of NDEs.  The book is interspersed with fun characters and references to well-known books and movies.  The author has obviously done her medical homework to be able to write this book.  Although I was getting annoyed with the repetitions in the lives of the characters (racing around the hospital, avoiding people, not answering pagers, cafeterias that are always closed, hospital locations that are insanely difficult to get to), I finally realized that these were unifying forces in the book and mirrored the NDE experiences.  The book was well worth the read and won't soon be forgotten.	2002-10-28

Not only are the pictures very clear, but the questions that allow you to narrow down the tree type are very clear.  This book is also small, so it's easy to bring with you when hiking so you can just whip it out when you see an interesting tree.  This is the book that led to my profound curiosity and love of trees.  Too bad I lent my copy to someone who took it back with her to Korea!	2002-10-06

A young girl, Una, is sent to live with her relatives in a light house because she refuses to adhere to her father's religious beliefs.  She soon disguises herself as a boy to go aboard a whaling ship.  The beginning sets the stage for what could be a very deep book.  I was disappointed that it turned out to be a book about Una's progression of husbands.  She falls in love with a man who drowns, thus she marries his best friend.  Her husband goes crazy and disappears.  She then marries a kindred spirit, Ahab, who leaves her in a beautiful house for years while he searches Moby Dick (who was responsible for him losing his leg).  After she learns that Ahab is killed by Moby Dick, she meets and cohabitates with her new neighbor.  In retrospect, the story seems to be more about the progression of men in her life than anything else.  The deepness that seemed possible at the beginning of the book is never realized.	2002-08-27

I was never allowed to by my mother because she was supposedly too controversial.  So, when I found an adult book by her, I was determined to rebelliously snatch it up.  Aside from the sexual content, the book seemed pretty dull to me.  I felt like I was reliving my teenage years through the characters:  the best friend stealing my boyfriend, the boyfriend that I barely know other than physically, the pettiness of people, the misunderstandings and lack of communication between everybody, mothers that leave their children to be brought up by strangers.  I just wasn't impressed.  Yes, it's easy to read.  But there's no suspense.  The whole book is so surface-level.  I supose it's realistic, but no award winner.  The book seems to end just because it shouldn't possibly go on any longer.	2002-08-17

The reviews I had read of this book made Georgiana out to to be sexually risque and controversial.  Either the author didn't go into enough detail, or the reviewers were reading between the lines.  Actually, the real controversy comes in some of the well-blacked-out sections of Georgiana's correspondance.  The letters written from and to Georgiana made me long for a return to letter writing in this computer age we live in.  Georgiana definitely was an interesting individual.  She had a friendship with Marie Antoinette before the French Revolution (rumored to be lesbian in nature).  A color, Devonshire brown, was created by Georgiana.  I also fell in love with Georgiana's wardrobe.  Georgiana seems to be a Scarlett O'Hara of world history.  However, I was very disappointed at the lack of editorial work on the novel.  I've never read a book before that I wanted to send back to the author with corrections (especially for comma problems).  I skimmed the last part of the book because it became rather dry and boring.	2002-08-15

The Edge of Reason wasn't quite as good as the original Bridget Jones' Diary.  Bridget and Mark Darcy are still loveable.  And Bridget is closer to the edge of insanity than the edge of reason throughout the book.  It made me glad that I'm not still single!  What saved the book was when Bridget was wrongly imprisoned in Thailand.  This is one book that will probably be better as a movie.	2002-08-14

All the newest inventions have left people with less and less time and made everyone shallower and shallower. She predicts that, 3 days after Christmas, the end of the world will come and only herself and her slacker friends will be left. The question is, can they learn from being the only people left in the world or will they continue to be slackers. I have never been swept into a book in such a way; I found my dreams getting tangled up in this book at night. But it's fitting, since it seems that much of the book takes place in the realm of dreams. I love the mandate given to the characters at the end of the book to go out and ask questions and make people think. Without asking questions about how we got to where we are, the purpose of it all, and where we are going, the world stagnates.  The author touches on my own feeling that technology is actually causing many people to stagnate.  You can tell this if you've ever been in an internet chat room and have tried to procure any intellectual conversation from anyone.  Great book.	2002-08-12

She is imprisoned for nearly 20 years before being pardoned.  Since this is based on a true story, the author carefully crafts the story in such a way as to not give a definitive answer on her true guilt or innocense.  Although a great period piece for Canada in the 1800s, I didn't find myself turning the pages ravenously or wanting to return to the book at the end of the day.  But it is well-written and I don't think that I will forget the life of Grace very soon.  The author has a gift of pulling you into the time period.	2002-08-12

The nature of this flower is a perfect symbol in explaining this book. Upon beginning this book, you feel as if you are being washed in a pale purple lyrical dream full of everything beautiful. The author awakens your senses to the beauty of her characters' world. This beauty is shattered when Astrid's mother, a poet, is put into prison for a crime of passion. Astrid spends several years of her life moving from foster home to foster home. She yearns for the beauty she knew with her mother. Astrid takes a little from every person she meets along the way: good, bad, beauty, and everything else. As an artist, rather than writing a diary, she draws pictures of the world she encounters. White Oleander is a book that draws you inside it. You will long for the book to continue and want to read it slowly so that it will not end too soon. The characters will become as real as your own friends. And, it's a book with a happy ending despite it's often dark and rocky places. It has quickly become one of my top 3 favorite books.	2002-08-05

It wouldn't have been complete without all the pictures.  I felt that it covered every aspect about twins that one could possibly be interested in.  However, I was hungry for more personal stories about the similarities and differences of twins in their own words.  I also wished there had been more solid black and white percentage results given from the twin tests the author talked so much about.  If it took days to give these tests, I would have liked to have seen some hard results.	2002-08-05

Her personality actually started to annoy me.  However, the book itself is a good one.  Miss Julia is determined to do everything it takes to find Hazel Marie who turns up missing after a date with a crooked church fund raiser organizer.  When the police refuse to help, Miss Julia hires a private investigator and forces him to stay on the case by essentially &quot;taking over&quot;.  Even if Miss Julia rubs you the wrong way, you won't be able to put down this suspenseful book.  But I don't think I can stand any more of her in the sequal.	2002-07-22

The salon was born in Europe as a place for writers, artists, politicians, scientists, and lay people to come togethter for discussion.  In France, they were known as bureaux d'esprit (offices of wit).  In Britain, they were called &quot;penny universities&quot;.  The salon was the springboard for the French revolution, the encyclopedia, and the Academie.  Many famous people such as Oscar Wilde and Napoleon's brother have been members of salons.  Salons have been held at old lady's bedsides, in people's homes, in cafes, and in coffee houses all over<br />Europe and the United States.<br />This book is a a great &quot;how to&quot; book for anyone interested in starting their own salon.  It gives advice on what to do and not to do when starting a salon.  It tells how to solicit membership, how to pick topics, and how to keep the ball rolling during conversation.  This book is indespensible for anyone wanting to learn more about salons.  Most other books just give dry biographical information on the leaders of the salons without giving any details of the actual conversation.  This book, however, is well-written and very informative.  Now, if only I could get up the nerve to start one!	2002-07-22

This beginning should alert the reader that the true story must be seasoned with imagination.  Devorah adores her mother, Chenia. Strangely enough, she likes her better when her mother's world seems to be spinning the most out of control; this is the mother that seems real to her. Chenia tries twice to drown herself as her world spins out of control. Everyone in the book has an affair. But somehow, the author brings the chaotic spin of the ups and downs of life into a gentle hum when Chenia stops trying to find satisfaction in men and begins to find satisfaction in her love of art. Chenia has learned that you have to find happiness within yourself without depending on others for that happiness. This book is a page-turner. It's one of those rare books where you feel as if you are walking down the street with the characters. The author can make you love the characters Devorah loves and despise the characters Devorah despises.	2002-07-22

Isn't that awful!  I have much contact with Muslim women and was intrigued by this book.  It made me want to do as the author did and go live with them to experience their rich culture.  The author shows, not a society of repressed women, but a society of women that have a wonderful life.  Of course, each family is different.  Some of the things in the book did not hold true for some of the Muslim women that I have talked to.  However, this book does help in a great way to reveal the mystery behind the veil in a positive way, removing many of the stereotypes that the west generally has of women in the Middle East.	2002-07-19

Read it for the pure enjoyment of reading.  One thing I love about Barbara Kingsolver's books is that I can relate to her main characters' solitude of mind and intellect.  Love blossoms from loneliness.  Hope blossoms from striving day to day.  You'll find yourself yearning for the love interests of the two main characters as if they were your own.  The book has a certain harmony to it much like the harmony of life:  things are often left unresolved, people cope in the face of unexpected change, and nature continues oblivious to what's going on in my own little piece of life.  When I finished reading this book last year, I was disgusted with the ending.  But, a year later, I look back and realize that the book could have ended no other way.	2002-07-15

The writer writes naturally about controversial and touchy subjects: adultery, neglect, rape, homosexuality, abortion, going crazy, AIDS, suicide, stalking, death.

I kept on plugging away at this book thinking that everything would become clear in the end.  However, I was disappointed.  I was intrigued because the author writes the book from within the characters' minds, giving insight into the thoughts of the characters (however bizarre they may be). However, the writing style became very confusing.  The whole book is written in first person but the story is told by different people without a clear indication of who is talking.  So many of the sections leave you asking \\"Is this a daydream, is this a reality, who's talking, whatever happened to...?\\"  I initially thought there was a plot, but then I changed my mind several times about what the book was really about.  And nothing was resolved in the end except that Pem and Sarah get married.  But Pem is still confused in his faith and we never discover who stole the cross from his church.  I finished the book feeling that I'd really wasted my time although I had really wanted to like the book.	2002-06-20

There were, initially SO MANY characters, but the main ones are definitely memorable. The author has talent for looking deep into a person and writing about them like a cartoon artist would paint them. The book is full of reality: dreams that, once realized, are never as great as we dreamed them up to be --plans that don't go quite right. The author must be quite a pessimist. The book doesn't have a plot that grabs you and makes you continue turning pages. However, the pace speeds up a little bit.

The missionaries that brought Christianity to China did not seek to inundate China with Western culture, but to bring Christianity into the cultural contexts of the Chinese.  For example, rather than saying that the idea of reincarnation is wrong, they said that Jesus came to free them from the endless cycle of reincarnations.  The sutra entitled &quot;Returning to Your Original Nature&quot; is a transcript of a teaching that Jesus gave to his disciples.  The answer to the search for &quot;truth&quot; and the &quot;way to peace and happiness&quot; is truly there for people willing to open their mind and take it.  The simplicity of the sutras has the power to end theological debates on the things that really matter.  This book also gives a lot of historical information that brings the time period alive for me like nothing else has (considering that our society only has seemed to be concerned with Western civilization while ignoring the history of the East).  I would like to have a copy of the Jesus Sutras (translated of course) alone and by themselves to pour over.	2001-11-23
