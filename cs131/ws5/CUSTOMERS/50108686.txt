Paul Stump's previous works \\"The Music is All that Matters,\\" and \\"Digital Gothic,\\" prepared me for an exhaustive, incisive, piece written in a volcanic style, but this too-slim volume about one of the most beloved (and least successful) of the golden age Prog bands was less than I had hoped for. Having first heard of this book two years ago, and having unsuccesfully ordered it four or five times, I was finally rewarded by it's unexpected arrival a few months ago.  Rather like the fabled prodigal, I put rather too much hope on Stumps book to fill the void in my life that constituted my love for vintage bands like Gentle Giant.<br /><br />If you love or are even interested in Gentle Giant, then Gentle Giant: Acquiring the Taste is a good place to start. The band was a family affair, begun by three brothers awash in the British music scene of the 1960's. Derek, Phil, and Ray Shulman began as would-be pop stars in Simon DuPre and the Big Sound. The evolution of their music from the beguiling \\"Kites,\\" their semi-hit of 1967, to the utterly anti-commercial music of the Gentle Giant years is the important mystery.  Stump illuminates this transition from Psyhedelic to Prog rock with his usual clarity and deftness, making clear the motivation forces behind the band's complex music.<br /><br />Financial rewards always eluded the band, because, as Stump theorized, the emphasized their American audiences, who were loyal, if small, over their European ones who were larger and equally loyal. Stump also posits that bad luck, among other problems doomed the band.  But consider that Gentle Giant put out eleven albums, only one of which was a live performance, the band's so-called failure becomes less clear. So they never had a million seller, so they never made the cover of Rolling Stone, they still had a respectable career.  Stump invests a lot in promulgating this aura of America as the graveyard of mid-level English bands like Gentle Giant, but the two shows I saw in 1976-1977 in Philadelphia were packed and enthusiastic. I knew about and bought the import album \\"In a Glass House.\\"<br /><br />But there's the problem: myopia. I and my friends went out of our way to see the band and buy their albums, but as my friend Roger says \\"I saw Gentle Giant twice, but never bothered to see Led Zeppelin at their peak.\\"  Maybe Stump is right: maybe GG should have toured Italy over and over, but if financial success was the only issue for the band, then they ought to have written different music.<br /><br />Gentle Giant: Acquiring the Taste is bittersweet, but if you loved the band, worth reading. The book includes a musical disquisition by Geir Hasnes that defines how Gentle Giant did what they did musically.<br /><br />Listen, if you saw GG in the 1970's, you saw the tightest, most organized, original musical group in the world. Underrated, yes, but highly influencial in modern Prog.1977 in Philadelphia were packed and enthusiastic.

Vowell explores all the assassinations of American presidents from Lincoln to McKinley, searching for remains of history.  She travels from Buffalo to the Dry Tortugas seeking out places where assassins, conspirators, and presidents met their gruesome ends.<br /><br />Vowell punctures some of the schoolbook myths surrounding classic assassinations such as the supposed humor of \\"My American Cousin,\\" the play Lincoln watched as Booth shot him, and the description of the clearly psychotic Charles Giteau as \\"a dissapointed office-seeker.\\"  Vowell makes clear the deep roots Booth and Giteau had in American culture; Booth is from a well-known acting family, and Giteau spent time in the Oneida colony. Cozgolz (spelling his name eludes me) becomes less clear that either Giteau or Booth, possibly because he just wasn't as wacky.<br /><br />There are some disturbing notes to Vowell's book: the memorial to J.W. Booth still maitained in Virginia, and the visit to the prison on the dry Tortugas, but these add to the solemnity of this seemingly spritely work, which after, all is about political murder.<br /><br />I am most moved by the story of Benjamin Harrision, who might have been the president the post-civil war US needed most after the disaster of the Grant administration.  Instead we got C.A. Arthur, former collector of the Port of New York, where Herman Melville (author of Moby Dick) worked for many years, failing to be promoted mainly due to his probity. That Arthur rose is indicative of the reward for institution dishonesty that plagued our pre-IRS method of tax collection.  None of this I knew before I heard Vowell's book.<br /><br />If you love history, and are a history dweeb like me and Sarah Vowell, you will love this book. If you want a good read, you will enjoy this book. I advise listening to it, as Vowell's well-known voice gives the book a real depth.<br /><br />More, Sarah, More.oice gives the book a real depth.  <br /> <br />More, Sarah, More.	2005-07-10

As soon I heard Keith Emerson's playing, I was dumb-struck by his virtuosity and musical vision, one that, alas, did not play out too well over the years. I eagerly awaited this book, mainly because I wanted to hear what Keith Emerson had to say about his music.<br />There's a scene in &quot;Spinal Tap&quot; when David St. Hubbins is playing a beautiful piano piece and Rob Reiner asks him what the music is called . St. Hubbins replies &quot;Lift my Love Pump.&quot; Well, I think that might sum up this book, and I can't say I wasn't warned by the title.<br />There are virtues here, however. Emerson has a breezy, conversational writing style that goes down easy, and he doesn't write a self-serving book in the least. The first part of the book, from his childhood to his breaking up the Nice is the best part, funny, and heartwarming. It struck me how much Emerson loved Lee Jackson and Brian Davidson, and the affection for his once and future bandmates mixed well with the stories. I often found myself laughing out loud.<br />The ELP and after sections are troubled. It's clear Emerson never liked Lake, and had a brotherly and patronizing attitude towards Palmer. But love between bandmates doesn't necessarily make great music, however, after reading this book and listening to the ELP oveure, I finally sensed the coldness that so many critics complained about.<br />The descent into drugs, the sadness of an abortion caused by miscommunication, the wrecking of Emerson's hand and the subsequent operations all make the second half of the book more than a bit sad. Emerson might have toned his words for this part of the book, but it continues in a breakneck and breezy manner, giving the impression (false I'm sure) that Emerson didn't care about these things.<br />My biggest complaint, however, is that he hardly discusses the music at all.  I would have put up with hijinx and lines of coke with Bonzo better if he had talked about composing Tarkus more.<br />Still, for a proghead and synthfool like me, Pics of Ex is worth reading, even if the God of the Moog diminishes himself.talked about composing Tarkus more. <br />Still, for a proghead and synthfool like me, Pics of Ex is worth reading, even if the God of the Moog diminishes himself.	2004-07-19

Although the previous book in the series, 1633, is not strong, this collection of stories has a lot to offer fans of this series.  The implications of a modern American culture being transported back to the Thirty Years War is explored by several different authors from the well known Mercedes Lackey, to the unknown, with several middling efforts among the stronger pieces.<br />Lackey's piece about Grantville's dope farmer's dying business is fun and enjoyable, as well as being historically intriguing.  The piece about dentures isn't so strong, or at least I didn't find it so.  K.D. Wentworth's X-mas party with deep political implications is my favorite of the lot - I went out and bought Wentworth's Moonspeaker right after I finished reading ROF- but Flint's story of how a small town Jewish jeweler becomes the savior of Prague is the most impressive of the group.<br />I didn't expect too much when I bought this book, but I was happily surprised by both the level of writing and the level of invention.<br />If you liked 1632, this is a good read.  If you're interested in this altnerative universe, ROF is a good introduction.	2004-01-05

I loved the sounds, the technology, the possibilities of electronic music. I even saved up and bought a Minimoog when I was thirteen; no greater love have I ever had.  The early days of electronics shook many people like it did me.  The synthesizer was not just a collection of dials and patch cords, but a way into a sonic universe.<br />Trever Pinch and Frank Trocco's new book, ANALOG DAYS, recaptures that feeling of celestial expectancy. Describing the development of the Moog synthesizer from kit-built theremins to the ubiquitous and glorious Minimoog, the book mainly concentrates on pre-polyphonic modalur synths and how the world embraced them, and then turned them into cheese-making devices a-la \\"Switched-On Whatever\\" albums.<br />Pinch and Trocco give us other ways to look at synths: they discuss women synthesists like Suzanne Ciani who never are mentioned in other histories even though Ms. Ciani's synthesized commercial work is probably the heard electronic music ever.  Though Moog-centric, the book gives us the background of the Buchla box, a sort of sprout-and-wheat-germ rival to the Moog modulars.  While Moog turned the synthesizer into a keyboard instruments, Buchla kept his machines free of established interfaces, and established musical norms.<br />As a sythn-freak, I couldn't put this book down, even though much the material is duplicated in Mark Vail's Vintage Synths. Vail, however, choose to be only a technical historian, while Pinch and Trocco aim for a more cultural view of the events surrounding the shifting of musical boundaries.<br />All your favorites are here; the unexpectedly successful Dr. Moog; the victorious but hubristic ARP company; the offhand eccentricities of EMS and their wonderful VCS3 named by Tristam Cary, son of Joyce Cary, the novelist.  Don Buchla haunts the pages too, half Kesian merry-maker, half NASA sub-contractor with his silver, red and blue synths bleeping in the Haight. And good old Keith Emerson's here too, flailing his ribbon controller across the arenas of America.<br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in electronic music, anyone interested in why their microwave talks to them, anyone interested in the history of 1960's.<br />Analog Days also has a really cool cover.g in the Haight.

You watched the Carole Burnett show, and there were the 5th Dimension singing \\"Up, Up and Away.\\"  Turn on the radio, and Richard Harris' cake melted in the rain.  Glen Campbell rode the Witchia line, drove through Phoenix, and ruminated about Galveston. Those incandescent melodies entered my childhood and have stayed with me.<br />Hard rock drove this more upbeat music from the airwaves, but Jimmy Webb's legacy remains in the catalog of fine songs he wrote at a precocious age.  Now his book gives us some insight into the mind who might arguably be called the last great songwriter of the 20th century.<br />Many people coming to this book will eagerly open it, hoping to extract the secret than made Jimmy Webb into a wealthy man, and they will come away dissappointed and frustrated.  This is not a book about how to write a song, so much as it is a repository of the mind of Jimmy Webb. True, Jimmy writes about how he composes a lyric, and how he creates a chord progression.  His discussion of prosody is excellent, too.  But there is more here that simple technical discussion of song writing.<br />This book a cultural history of the American song up to the end of the 1960's.  Jimmy Webb gives us stories, his own history, his background, and discussions of songs from the beginning of the modern era to the present. For some like me, who has a deep interest in American Cultural history, this book is a gem.<br />Musican theoriticans might have a fit when Jimmy Webb starts giving his version of Secondary Dominants and other chord substutions, but again, when they've written \\"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\\" I'll listen to them.<br />Other reviewers say that it would be better to have some knowledge of music theory before you read this book, and I agree with that.  When Jimmy starts on about 7th chords No 3 with a minor 2nd in the bass, you might start stratching your head if you don't know what he's talking about. Have a keyboard around so you can play the examples.<br />This book is like taking a master class from a professional, not a seminar by a music teacher who never's sold one song, let alone had hit after hit, gold records, Grammies.  Jimmy Webb is an authentic American genius - he and Brian Wilson on the west coast - Dylan on the East - who blew the roof off of the stilted 32 bar song and the 12 bar blues.<br />Tunesmith is about songwriting, not about how to write a song.  If you have to ask the difference, you'll never know.immy starts on about 7th chords No 3 with a minor 2nd in the bass, you might start stratching your head if you don't know what he's talking about.

LeGuin's \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" comes from a different place then the other two fantasists with whom her Earthsea trilogy is so often compared. Tolkein's so-called fantasy was a real attempt to capture what Tolkein believed the languagues lost before the beginnings of early English, while his Oxford colleague wrote his Narnia fantasies from a Christian viewpoint.  LeGuin's fantasy novels derive from her background in anthropology and show it in every way.<br /><br />The story concerns the Wizard Sparrowhawk and his education. Sparrowhawk comes from a desperately poor village in the mountains, from among illiterate peasants (compare to the world of the hobbits, where, though illiterate, there is no squalor) who live with their goats. His home island, Gont, is the birthplace of Goatherds, Pirates, and Wizards, and from an early age Sparrowhawk shows his powers.  After saving his village from an invading army, Sparrowhawk is apprenticed to Ogion, the great Mage.  There Sparrowhawk begins to learn what Wizards know: the names of all things.  He also is drawn to showing off, including calling up the dead.<br /><br />Too powerful and curious for Ogion, Sparrowhawk goes to the isle of Roke to attend the school there ( Rowling only stole from the best) and finds he's not only the best pupil, but he can make enemies.  In a boast, he calls up a spirit and brings out a sort of un-him. The un-him scars Sparrowhawk and kills the school's Archmage who uses his power to try and undo what Sparrowhawk has done.<br /><br />Ged, Sparrowhawk's true name, must now pursue this unhim while fighting dragons, evil stones, and gibbeths, people the unhim have entered and destroyed.<br /><br />Finally, Ged turns on his pursuer to fight an epic battle on the unsea and reunite himself.<br /><br />LeGuin's spare prose is based on folktales, and myths, and Earthsea's theology of balance, true names, and magic is clear: Ged has disturbed the balance, so he must restore it.  Like Tolkein's and Lewis' books, there is a sexual innocence here: Ged is a mage first and foremost: he feel attractions, but no lust. Of course, Heros of Myth are too good to be lustful; chastity preserves their power.<br /><br />Unlike the other fantasies, the Earthsea Trilogy is not England, but an actual mythical place, albeit medieval in a European sense. Ged is no Englishman either, being copper-colored.<br /><br />The deep understanding of what makes a culture a culture underlies everything LeGuin has written, from \\"The Dispossed\\" to \\"Terhanu.\\"  The intelligence behind these books is impressive, neither sentimental nor baroque, almost clinical in its portrayal of an premodern world where magic does work, and where every action has personal consequences and real pain.xual innocence here: Ged is a mage first and foremost: he feel attractions, but no lust.

Showcasing great musicianship and knowledge of Classical musical forms, the Nice were the missing link between Psychedelic mayhem and Progressive pandemonium.<br />Martyn Hanson gives us a complete run-down of each member of this revolutionary band, and details how they came together ostensibly as P.P. Arnold's back-up band.  Original manager Andrew Loog Oldham,[inespensively], needed an opening act, so The Nice stepped forward.  Hanson show how lamentable management skills of the mentally-unbalanced Oldham put pressures on the band to constantly tour since they never saw a penny of royalties from any of their albums.<br />The Nice began with four players, and almost according to the [strange] script of LSD-laced guitarists, Davy O'List became more and more unbalanced and was let go, reducing The Nice to a power trio, but giving Keith Emerson more influence.  Throughout the remainder of the 60's The Nice produced ambitious, if poorly recorded albums, and built a fan base.<br />Emerson wanted better players, certaintly a better singer than Lee Jackson, so he dumped the Nice to hook up with \\"his heaviness\\" Greg Lake and Carl Palmer to form ELP, a higher-tech version of The Nice, although Emerson claimed he wanted to do something different.  Hanson is critical of ELP's work, but I can't imagine Jackson or Davidson playing on say \\"Tarkus\\" or \\"Brain Salad Surgery.\\"  Emerson snakebit his former bandmates when he broke up The Nice, and they both have struggled unfairly.  Yes destroyed their second chance of a breakthrough when they recruited Patrick Moraz from Refugee to replace Rick Wakeman.<br />Hanson's book is well-written, full of information, anecdotal, and appraisals with a slight critical edge that gives his recounting of the rise, fall, and rebirth of this seminal 1960's band.

Singer wrote Satan in Goray at the age of 26 or so, and the impressiveness of this work becomes all the more clear.  Few people of that age, or any age could evoke an historical era with such force or create a fractured narrative of such power. The world of religious conflict, superstition, and messianiac hysteria is Singer's main interest, subjects he would pursue for the rest of his life. Satan in Goray is a strong beginning, a prophetic book (written in the early 1930's) of a trapped people on the edge of a disaster.<br />The book takes place as the Jews of Gory attempt to recover from the Chelmelnicki massacres of the 1640's (the worst disaster for the Jews between the Crusades and the Holocaust). The Jews of Poland believe that, as Christian would say, the End Times are here, and expect the messiah to arrive. Shabbati Shevi appears on the scene, claiming to be the messiah. Many Jews fall under his sway, but the Rabbi of Goray resists and this further wracks the town.  As these political and social disasters are played out, a young orphan, Rechele, who is insane, becomes the center of interest of the town, as she is unmarried. When a holy man, Itche Mates, arrives in Goray, he marries the unfortuate Rechele, who proceeds to be posessed by Satan and do things that make Linda Blair in the Excorsist look amateur.<br />The novel itself has some problems; it's birth as a serial leaves it episodic. One has the sense of threads stopping and starting without reason, and there really is not what could be called a plot.  However, Singer's rich language, his pinpoint descriptions of people, places, and religious factions are stunning. Reading his work is an education.<br />Satan in Goray is a look into the hearts of Polish Jews right before World War II. The sense of helpless claustrophobia is appalling, the whiff of death overwhelming here.  Satan was not just in Goray, and Singer knew it.	2002-11-06

Except, of course, Cheever invented the form, so the so-called \\"typical New Yorker\\" story is a knock-off of John Cheever's work.  He is of his time and place, like Shakespeare or Sappho, so like all of us, he is limited by what he knew, lived and experienced.  But enough objections.<br />This collection of short stories can only be compared to great ouevres in world civilization; a lifetime's work, an exploration of a life, a comphrensive vision of human life from a distinct perspective. Mozart's concerti, Beethoven's Symphonies, O'Keefe's paintings are akin to this book, this mass-market goldmine.<br />John Clellon Holmes said of Cheever's work that he was working through his own psychoanalysis on the page.  I certainly agree with that. From reading Cheever's letters and journals, one can see that he left little to himself. He was tortured by bisexuality, adultery, alcholism, feeling unloved by his parents, feeling himself socially and financially inferior to the braying socialities around him and his stories explore these conflicts with unflinching bravery.<br />Those who refuse to see past the social milieu are denying themselves the company of one America's greatest artists. I, too had to get over his settings, but then too, it took me a while to connect with Faulkner who's work is locked with a time and location that is never derided, unlike Cheever's. I assert there is no difference.<br />Cheever's collected stories are also a great place to understand writing. He is a master of understatement, of terse scenes, of inner horror, of the shabbiness of most people's moral lives.<br />Does he have nothing to say to us now? No. John Cheever was our last great writer, or the last great writer of the 20th century.<br />This great book is part of American culture no less than the NFLJohn Cheever was our last great writer, or the last great writer of the 20th century.<BR>This great book is part of American culture no less than the NFL	2002-09-11

This book, published in 1976, is perhaps the last example of what it means to be a humanist in the sense that one seeks an understanding of history, of human culture and failing, rather than using scholarship to justify political cant.<br />This gulf between scholars and the general culture is one of the results of the Great War, as Fussell reads the calamity. Fussell examines the breakdown of previous ideas of cultures in the context mainly of English poetry, showing the reader how the unprecedented violence and degradation of trench warfare stripped Western Culture bare, destroying Romanaticism, and allowing moderism to rise in its wake.<br />Fussell examines in depth certain aspects of the experience, for example the chapter titled \\"Myth, Ritual, and Romance\\" explores the way soldiers used their cultural understandings to make sense of their experience, or in some ways to control the nearly random destruction affecting them. The discussion on the symbolic value of the number 3 in the Great War is deep and enlightening.<br />Some may disagree with Fussell's interpretation of the experience of the Great War, however, few have written a book of any type that come close to the intense qualities in GW&MM. It's written with a purgative urgency; Fussell as a former infantryman in WWII must present a voice for his brothers.  In this way, you may read GW&MM as a testament that far exceeds the cold and programmatic works that now pass as literary criticism.<br />Tobias Wolff and I once discussed this book and he said of it \\"Once you read The Great War and Modern Memory you feel civilized.\\"  I could not agree more.	2002-08-07

Yes, I read the entire book in almost one sitting.<br />Still...<br />1633, the second installment in Eric Flint's expanding universe ends with a long defense of collaboration with David Weber and others, which I think is due to the reader since 1633 is more than anything else, a victim of collabortion. This long book reads more like an outline than a novel.  Characters we came to know and love are shoved off to the sidelines so Mr. Weber can practice his compelling sea battles for the next Honor Harrington book.  Where is Julie and Alexander?

Beevor's dispassionate voice tells of the miscalculation of two pscyhopaths and how this led to deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, some innocent, and some not. Most readers will come to this book for a story of war and battle, but the heart of this work is detailed recounting of the immense bad faith involved in the German and Russian armies, the dictatorial leadership, and the mixture of compassion and brutality each army had.<br />Our sympathies are for the Russians, mine are, since Hitler had no legal right to invade Russian, nor legal cause, but Beevor makes plain the wreck of the Sixth Army as Hitler's planning goes awry. Although I am NOT for any humans suffering as these people did, the idea that Wehrmacht and SS Troops lived in conditions as horrendous as those transported to Death Camps pervades Stalingrad with a sense of cosmic justice.<br />Beevor writes so well, I'm reading all his other work.

Oren shows the complex issues that moved the Egypt and Israel into a deadly tragedy.  Putting the Six-Day War into his vast Cold War context illuminates the impotence of the Superpowers, the incompetence of Egypt and Syria, and the dangerous gamble Israel took when launching its necessary strike.<br />Oren gives us as many perspectives as he can; American, Russian, Israeli, Eqyptian, Jordanian, English participants all have their say. The brilliance of this book is not just Oren's gripping account of the war, but his making the reader understand the incredible pressure that Nasser, King Hussein, and Levi Eshkol were under.  This book made me feel some sympathy for the Egyptians, poorly-led, sacrificed to Nasser's macho posturing and cronyism, to Cold war cant, and massive poverty.<br />What is chilling about this book is that nearly forty years later, not much has changed, as Oren points out.<br />Readers of Tom Clancy will find real people and real tragedy more gripping than fake heroics; no heros here, just survivors.	2002-06-11

This is dismaying, because instead of reading history, you are sent to the library to look up historians. You have to write long papers about who said what and why, which makes you drink Schmidt's beer to excess. You start writing bad poems, because you can't stand to read poorly-written analyses of other people's writing.  If you wanted to do that, you could have been an English major.<br />I only wish this book had been out in 1978.  Cantor writes well, has encyclopedic knowledge of his subject, has a sense of humor (which  some people are mistaking for bitterness) and is not afraid to take a stand. His chapter on the Oxford Fantastists is excellent, informative, and something anyone interested in our current culture ought to read, since Tolkein and Lewis did much to form it.<br />Cantor's book is really creative non-fiction; the use of novelistic techniques in a non-fiction narrative, which to me, makes the book more readable, interesting, and more accurate. If you've spent no time around universities, then you can't understand how their internal politics shape thought and education, which Cantor shows perfectly well here.<br />I suppose some people bought this book expecting a history of the Middle Ages; shame on them for not reading the title, or looking inside the book.  Cantor's Civilazation of the Middle Ages is a good place to start if you're looking for that.  If you want to read about the historians who formed the current view of those strange times (less strange than our own) this is a good place to start.	2002-03-09

Like S.M. Stirling's Island in the Sea of Time, Flint's Americans are a mix, but not as natural a mix as Stirling creates.  I got the feeling I was reading the script to an old WW2 movie with all the requiste types sometimes.  This notwithstanding, Flint creates a dilemma and like the best of the alternative historians, plays it out to its inevitable conclusion.<br />Written painlessly, Flint's book celebrates the virtues of the disappearing American Union Worker, who according to the world Flint portrays is the last bastion of true American values, while the middle-class is not willing to extend the franchise to all who desire it.<br />What makes this book so good is that it's basis in the 30 years war is so well done.  The mercenary armies of Tilly and Wallenstein ravage the countryside in the name of the Pope, while King Gustavus Augustus leads Protestant Sweden against them.  The injection of modern American materialism, expectations of political freedom, and willingness to use massive force is dynamic, compelling, and alternatively stirring, horrifying, and amusing.<br />A good read, a good lesson.

I've read all the classics, and I even know some Literary Theory.  Gone With the Wind? Pul-lease, racist, sexist, revanchist trash, made popular by all the young woman dreaming of being Scarlett and having both their Rhett and Ashley.  Cheerleader fare.  Escapist.  WRONG!<br />Gone with the Wind is an American War &amp; Peace.  This is serious literature, which won the Pulitzer prize, no less.  Most people don't see past the epic plot (which isn't as cut and dried as you may think) or the love story, but this is no less than a successfull attempt to reclaim a discarded culture.  It is not about crinoline and lace, it it about the Apocalypse and how losers of the counter-revolution must learn to live in a place where all their politics, personal or civil, are demolished.  Scarlett O'Hara is popular because she is an American, driven, materialistic, sentimental and utterly ruthless.  Rhett Bulter is the tragic character of this book; the way of life and ideals he disdained are killing him, and he suffers like no one else in this post-apocalyptic landscape.  His departure at the end is an act of contrition as much as a romantic failure; he had tried to recreate the materialism of the ante-bellum world, but negeclected the spirituality (such as it is) of men like Ashley Wilkes.  Both men, the dreamer and the realist end up alone in a very sterile place.  This book is proto-feminist as well.  Scarlett survives, even as everything around her dies, but in the end, she too is alone.<br />Don't dumb this masterpiece down.  The movie fails to capture even a tenth of the depth here.  And that awful sequel! Caused by the mistake that this book is some kind of romance novel.  This is Art, and you can't stick a new ending on it, any more than you can a great painting or musical composition.	2001-11-03

His methodology is straightforward, and his rules sensible. The exercises bear fruit both as a learning experience and a stimulus for original compositions. Russo assumes you understand some rudimentary musical theory, and I suppose most people picking up this book will have that knowledge. Where I found this book most useful is in writing long themes, which had always daunted me. Russo's method is transportable, and when inspiration is stymied, I find what I've learned from this book can tide me over.<br />One reviewer makes the point that this book doesn't tie all the exercises together into longer pieces, which is true, but that's a flaw that can be remidied by reading scores, and looking at structural examples of other composers.<br />I wish I'd found this book years ago.	2001-09-24

Mrs. Whiting, who owns the Empire Grill, most of the town, and the bankrupt weaving mill, tries to impose her will on Miles to destroy his life, as her husband destroyed her life first by having an affair with Miles' mother, and then by committing a damaging mistake that ruins their future.<br />Russo is obsessed with rotten fathers, crazy widows, ruined downtowns, places and people far away from dot.com lives, soccer momism, and corporate anonymity. For Russo, every act of malice rings down the years, every act of bravado is shamed by the light of day.  In his books, people get on with their lives whether they want to or not.<br />Much like George Eliot, in her masterwork, Middlemarch, Russo sees a community made up of the ambitions, desires, and failures of its inhabitants.  No cowboys in this fiction, just trapped people who love and hate their bonds, like most of us.	2001-07-15

In the US, the Prog rock bands that we saw or heard about came to us after being fully formed, after years of practice, after they moved out of the club and university circuit.  What Stump's history does well is to show the roots, the trials, and the missteps of various bands coming to terms with both a new type of music and the end of the era that created it.  While not an unabashed fan of everything Prog, Stump's taste is excellent and his knowledge of the arcana of the British music scene is impressive.  Stump's writing is excellent, sometimes too good.  His analyses are dead on, and he takes into account the financial, political, and social explanations of why Prog took off, made millions, and flared out.<br />Of all the Prog books out there now, this is by far the best and most useful in understanding the music.  Those who dislike this book because Stump is honest in his evaluations ought to consider that someone who hated Prog would not have spent so much time and effort writing a book like this.	2001-05-14

Macan seeks to establish the music's credentials, first by exploring the cultural roots of the genre (mostly from an American view) then assembling a cannon of standard Prog classics, then analyzing four important Prog works as if they were serious musical compositions.  This approach works. Macan brings a musicians love and a teacher's experience to the discussion.  Appreciating just was good Prog was, and why it was good is often not important as the overwhelming musical chops the most famous Prog musicians used - sometimes to the detriment of their music tends to obscure the compositions themselves.  Viewed as an extension of the classical cannon, Prog becomes discernable as part of a high cultural continium that intersected with pop and folk styles for a brief span in the late Sixties before it died.<br />Prog is a middle-class form, hence its dismal by Marxist critics, but as the number of new prog bands and books like this appear, the appeal of the music, the appeal of form over function, of complexity, of ideas, is not dead. One aspect of Prog that Macan gets its the intense religiousity of the music, both in its roots, and in its message.<br />The best use of Edward Macan's book would be to read it simultaenously with Paul Stump's earthier English history of the genre.<br />Macan is uncomfortable with the written word; this book is too formal on occasion, leavening the insight with academic style, which is why I did not give it five stars.	2001-05-14

An apocalytic vision of dysfunction, a withering look at American, and not just southern ideas of goodness, an expose of the ignorance and superstition that still drives us like catnip entralls a cat, Rides of the Midway moves like a juggernaut, until Noel Witherspoon, Great American Sinner, is free of his past, his town, and himself.	2001-03-24

Their pretentions, their inner lives, and their wholly unspecteted courage is the point of his novels, of which, the Polish Officer is the best.<br />Furst is an elegent aphoristic writer - James Salter comes to mind as his model - and his work in imbued with a deep mood of fatalism, weltschmerz, and sexual heat as redemption for the displaced souls these books.	2001-02-04

In the early 1970's, few events were more exiting than hearing a new ELP release, and then seeing them perform live.  In an era plagued with boogie rock, nascent glam, and the brewing punk, ELP plunged ahead towards a modernist reading of music. Combining their classical chops, jazz free-styling, and heavy-metal sound, they created not just a sound, but a world around their music.<br />George Forrester's book explains the history of the band, their musical steps, and mis-steps in clear, straightforward prose.  While other works such as Paul Stump's The Music All's That Matter seems written with a distain for Prog and ELP, ELP: The Show Never Ends is an unabashed love letter for the devoted fan.<br />The books concludes with a musical exegesis of Keith Emerson's work, and to anyone who understands music, these analyses are enlightening, and thought-provoking.<br />If you want to learn about ELP, this is the place.  If you want to relive the salad days, this is the place.  If you want a picture of the rollercoaster ride of 1970's rock, this book will show you how a band was greeted with great hope and then dismissed into oblivion mostly because they knew how to play their instruments well.	2001-01-30

It is not for the beginner, and if you are trying to learn chord progressions or musical structure there are  other places to go.  However, if you're interested in moving beyond  rudimentary scales and chords, this book can help you.	2000-06-16
