Broken up only by tales of fishing, baseball &amp; (mostly married) men titillated by $20 Cuban hookers or smitten by young Cuban senorita stereotypes, this book reads like a slow walk through a pool hall filled with pot-bellied, balding men puffing on cigars &amp; slapping each other on the back as they pump out tall tales about all the fish (&amp; women) they've caught. Cuba as the setting is only incidental.	2004-07-03

I also had to purchase the English-Dakota dictionary, because for some ridiculous reason (most dictionaries provide both (Forgein Language)-English & English-(Forgein Language)translations in ONE book) this dictionary only goes one way, so you have to buy another one to get the rest! Annoying & Expensive!	2002-01-20

This is the only French dictionary you will ever need. It is so thorough, it's unbelievable.

Meglomaniac) Unveiled	This book is a wonderfully engrossing read - almost as good a ride as any  at Disneyland. It takes you through detailed accounts of the inner workings  of Hollywood and most especially the inner workings of one self-centered  meglomaniac with a startling lack of conscience (for someone in charge of a  studio touting its appeal to children) who rules the Disney roost and will  undoubtedly be its unmaking if he is left to rule as he does now...

The author writes as candidly as she can, considering the women she included are still alive (Dawn Steel  aside) and desirous of keeping their Hollywood careers going (i.e. there is  a political cautiousness throughout, as men still do rule the Hollywood  roost and offending them would not help any of these successful women's  careers. Though the content is informative and enlightening, the choppiness  of the books' overall structure is quite annoying, as is the way the author  consistantly refers to people suddenly out of nowhere without explaining  who they are and how they fit into the picture. Also irritating, is the  chapter formation - they jump from woman to woman without any apparent  rhyme or reason, cutting of the story of one to start the story of another  and not returning to continue the story of the first until many chapters  (and women) later - the result being that by the time you get to the pick  up of a left off story, you've got to go back and refresh your memory on  who she was and where her story left off! Though not the smoothest read  ever, this book is definately a must read by anyone desirous of  understanding just how male-driven, male-oriented, male-everything  Hollywood is (as if that isn't already apparent in every film) and just how  tight the keyhole is for women to squeeze through!	2000-07-12

Having read many books on La Pucelle, I must say that reading her actual words - the way she spoke, her own phrasing, her own expressions - brings her to life in a way no other writings about her can. Her words, lifted  from the actual transcripts of her trials and from letters which she  dictated, bring to life the living, breathing girl complete with her  feelings; her deep love of her Lord, her frustrations, her anger, her  anguish; along with her firsthand account of her childhood! This is not a  story - if you are looking for the telling of the story of Jehanne d'Arc,  invest in any of Regine Pernoud's books for complete historical acuracy  without distorted legend.  This particular book gives only Jehanne's words  (along with the words of her interrogators), in the progressive order of  the transcripts of her trials and her words in letters which she  dictated.There are very few informational notes and there is no story to  speak of. A must-read for all! I recommend it highly!	2000-06-01
US	52717249	R1IJKRLSJ89LLP	0140450238	406634024	Saint Joan: A Chronicle Play in Six Scenes and an Epilogue (Shaw Library)	Books	1	18	33	N	Y	Shaw's Ridiculous, Inaccurate Jehanne d'Arc	I was truly disappointed by Shaw's wholly inaccurate, blatantly chauvanistic Preface (Shaw actually contends that Jehanne was tried more than fairly by sympathetic, God-fearing and open-minded men, and that she was burned as a result of her own stupidity!). I was more disappointed by  the play itself-it is not a play about Jehanne's life, but rather about the  pompous musings of male peacocks spreading their tails like an eclipse over  the Maid herself. Shaw portrays Jehanne as a silly little tomboy who threw  off her skirts and donned trousers to play soldier and skipped into the  King's chambers cooing &amp; giggling about God and war. Jehanne is rarely  actually IN a scene - much of the play is, as I said, dominated by the  peacocks of her trial discussing her, ranting about her, defaming her, etc.  She only skips in throughout to swoon mindlessly over God and stamped her  spoiled foot for war. Shaw gives one the sense that her presence in a scene  is only disrupting the continuation of his wordy play of peacocks!  Redeeming quality: the last scenes - Shaw actually allows Jehanne to grow a  sudden brain and speak out intelligently against the peacocks, which he has  already condemned her for in his preface!  For real facts and a true  portrayal of The Maid, stick to Regine Pernoud.	2000-04-29
