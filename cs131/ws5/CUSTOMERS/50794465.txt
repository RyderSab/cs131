Having retired, Vivian Paley now tells the story of a school she visits and comes quickly to love. They are doing stories in the 2's class - which might involve just one word from a child. which is later lovingly acted out by the whole class.  <br />As an early childhood educator, I read Paley to get ideas and wisdom for my own classroom. But this is a book that parents could enjoy as well, and it should certainly let others know through the warmth and wisdom of the school what good early care should be!	2004-07-20

I think if I was from Texas I would have enjoyed it even more - stopping at &quot;Willie B's&quot; to eat ribs, going to the local honky tonk each week, the presence of religious zeal, and the overriding presence of what it is like to live in a small town where everyone knows everything.  <br /> An underlying current throughout the book is the fact that 3 fathers have left, shaping the people remaining, but no one is shedding a tear over these losses now, a refreshing fact in a coming of age story.	2004-07-20

From the back cover:\\"\\"Maddy Braverman, 30 and still single, has taught first grade at an exclusing private school...Her only respite from the monotony is her celebrity filled fantasy life\\"<br />I thought I could relate to this book, for I thought I could see a bit of myself in Maddy. How often are books written about fantasizing about celebrities, something many of us won't admit to doing! But here, Maddy actually has run-ins with some celebrities, due to her job at the exclusive Manhattan school and her roomate working in the field of publicity. <BR>If you can stand to read about a teacher who seems to be out drinking every other night, and can get through some dialogue such as :<BR>\\"I'm probably making a huge dramatic deal over nothing...But he is so...\\"<BR>\\"Ripe with f#@kability?\\"<BR>then you can find fun and humor in this book, as I did. It actually comes together towards the end and begins to become more of a true novel, and less like cheesy chick-lit.	2004-05-23

For a year now, this book jumps out at me from the bookstore shelves, as I'm always looking for Martha's Vineyard fiction, but the premise just seemed too corny. (Not to mention that I didn't know it actually WAS set, in part, on MV)<BR>You know right from the begining that Katie, having read the diary, is left touched beyond words, so I was immediately drawn into the question - &quot;What is in the diary?&quot;. <BR>I liked that the story was not just a diary, but interspersed with details of the life of Katie, who is in possession of the book. Even the diary chapters read more like a novel, and I was left wondering why on earth a mother would write some of these things to her baby son?!<BR>It is an easy, quick read, and a little over the top in the way a love story tends to be, somewhat in the vein of any Nicholas Sparks novels. A great read for a day at the beach.	2004-05-23

I picked this book off the shelf in a college library with a large early childhood education department. I have been teaching for many years but needed some specific information about a play based curriculum.  My original intention was just to jot afew notes at the library, and then I found myself checking the book out so I could read more. And now I find myself looking it up on Amazon to purchase it for myself. <br />This book describes what good early childhood programs should include. Children learn through play, and there are many theorists and researchers ( Dewey, Piaget, Montessori, etc)out there who can validate this, and their information is included in this easy to read book. This book describes how play is important to different domains (cognitive, social, emotional, physical)as well as different curriculum areas (literacy, math, science, social studies). I have found it an excellent reminder,and will use the information to keep parents and student teachers on the right track.	2004-05-11

In truth, there is very little about the books themselves, and much more about the individuals who make up the book club. Each chapter is casually divided into sub-stories, revealing ever increasing details about each of the members. <br />You don't need to be a fan, or even that familiar, with Jane Austen, but I imagine it would add even more to the enjoyment of this book.	2004-05-07

I think the writing was wonderful in that it allows the reader to understand where Carrie is coming from, without a lot of self pity or inner dialogue on her part. When she finally decides to pack up and take off, away from her childhood sweetheart and all that she has known, it is easy to imagine how she has gotten to this point. <BR>I agree with some other reviews that suggest the characters are flat, one dimensional. It was hard for me to formulate a picture of any of them fully, including Kilroy, Carrie's love interest when arrives in  New York City, yet somehow this does not diminish the story in any way. <BR>In the end, I believe this story does a wonderful job of describing the reality of living two completely separate lives, fitting in fully in either one of them, yet unable to move back and forth between the two. Some worlds are not meant to collide.	2004-05-02

Had I known before reading this book that it was a &quot;collection of short stories compiled to read like a novel&quot;, I would have had a better understanding of how, out of nowhere, one chapter is suddenly told in a first person voice that is not the main character. I continued through the rest of the book to look for these characters to appear, and when they never showed up again, it left me disconcerted and puzzled. <BR>There is also a chapter where the first person narrative switches to another voice, but this change did not seem as out of place as the sudden addition of new characters. It was interesting how much was covered in this one chapter, without much detail, yet adding to the fullness and depth of the main character. <br />A fast, easy read, with likeable characters	2004-05-02

This is not a book with easy answers, and as I began to read, I don't believe it was intended to be such. It is a very enjoyable read, fast and easy, about the day to day interactions of the author's own classroom. She utilizes some wonderful methods of interacting with and empowering the children, and for this reason I could easily recommend this book be required reading in a college teacher prep course. But in an effort to go deeper into her understanding of bullying, she digresses from her class to interview her brother (a former teaser, now a social worker) and high school students on their experiences. Quite frankly, reading the high school dialogue became tedious (however brief it was) with all the \\"Like's\\" that could have just been assumed by the reader. <BR>Overall, I did devour this book and would recommend it to my fellow teachers, (...)	2004-04-01

It is actually 3 stories in one: the independent naturalist who finds romance where she doesn't want it, the suddenly widowed Lusa who finds strength in herself, and the cantankerous old man who finds friendship where he least expects it. I was at first disappointed when I realized that the characters were not actually going to interact with each other, but through various circumstances it all comes together at the end.<br />I THINK THIS SHOULD BE A MUST-READ FOR ALL STUDENTS OF BIOLOGY.  Each of the 3 parts of this book has more information about the laws of nature than I learned in college, yet it is woven so intricately into the story that you are left wanting to get outside into the hills without knowing why.	2003-09-21

This book is worth every penny for early childhood programs who are interested in creating nurturing spaces for children to flourish. Even the  look of the book makes you want to savor it - hundreds of color photographs on glossy pages that invite you to browse before even reading the text.<br />This is not a curriculum book per se, although it certainly offers ideas and suggestions for activities, such as expanding the small block materials with drift wood, smooth stones, and other found materials. It is more about creating an aesthetically pleasing environment in which children can learn and grow AND be comfortable space for children, teachers, and parents alike.	2003-08-10

The Creative Curriculum is a guide for early childhood classrooms which addresses the environment and learning centers, as well as the role of the teacher. It is compatible with other known practices in early childhood, including the project approach, Reggio Emilia, and emergent curriculum.

It could be useful before teaching as a preventative, or as a resource when problems arise.  I find it most useful around conference time when I'm preparing for those more challenging conferences. Look at the table of contents, and you will see it offers suggestions from classroom environment, getting along with co-workers and parents, typical behaviors that are challenging, and unusual behaviors. Each section offers preventative advice and then what to do when problems do occur. THe advice is not always thorough, but it does address a wide variety of real classroom problems.	2003-06-02

I picked up this book to share with my preschool class when we were studying pets.  It is filled with good messages, and yet does not come across as being preachy. It begins with Norman being adopted from an animal shelter as an adult dog (great message #1). Eventually they learn Norman is going blind. Of course the family will keep Norman, that is never a question! (great message #2). Their older dog Lucy helps Norman by walking next to him so he doesn't bump into things (#3). Norman loves the beach because there he doesn't have to worry about bumping into things. While there, he rescues a girl struggling in the water (#4). It takes the team of people on the beach plus Norman to get the girl in safely (#5). Norman is the hero! An easy reader or a nice read for younger children.  I will definitely be purchasing other books in this series.	2003-05-08

We all have hair to keep us warm.\\" Then on the next page, \\"We are all different, our hair looks different\\".  The children are immediately attracted to the Sesame Street characters and the possibility of guessing each character by their distinguishing feature.

There are currently 266 other reviews of this book available here, so I won't waste time revisiting the plot. The author tells her story in first person, with the insight and \\"wisdom\\" of the child she is throughout most of this book. The realities for her include  terrorism, alcoholism, depression, racism, death. But through it all is the love of family, strength of character, and the background of a very real Africa that few of us could ever know. Although the chronology is jumbled at first, the reader can quickly acclimate to the unusual flow of the dialogue and novel. But it is for this reason that I give it 4, not 5 stars. It certainly is a book that left me wishing for a sequel.	2003-05-03

Althought the age group listed for this book is 9-12, I first learned of it from a preschooler in my classroom. The girl who shared the book does not have a sister, lives with both parents in an upperclass neighborhood, and would seem to have little in common with Essie or Amber. And yet, this story reached her, she connected immediately with the strengths and longings of both children. She wants to BE these children, for their strength and humanity.  What a great way to begin to bridge the socioeconomic gap! Other children from very diverse backgrounds in my class were also immediately drawn to the poetry of warmth, hope, caring, friendship amidst troubling circumstances.	2003-02-24

I found this book in a sale bin and grabbed it for the absolutely colorful, detailed, realistic watercolor illustrations. I could imagine using it with my preschool class just to play \\"I Spy\\" with the pictures.  Yes, the story is not traditional, but that is the reason I like it.  Maybe the intended message from this story isn't about divorce, but more about alternate lifestyles and acceptance. In fact, the story never even mentions marriage or divorce, simply saying 'Dad left'.  It shows that a child's life goes on - he still goes to school, has friends, watches tv. And he has feelings, but doesn't always know what to do with them, especially when the anger for his dad conflicts with the love and comfort he feels.  And Dad's life style is not even all that alternative - this is not about a gay lifestyle, as I first expected - but simply a return to nature and living simply. And that's not such a bad message to discuss with children.	2003-02-16

While the story was not of high interest to all of the children (probably better for slightly older children), it held their attention, and the 2 Chinese boys were thrilled to see familiar faces, familiar writing, and hear familiar words. The story is about a mother and son walking in the snow. The mother teaches the child the Chinese characters for certain words by explaining how the character looks like the word it represents. It was exciting to have the boys participate in storytime and be able to teach the rest of us something! This is so important in a diverse preschool classroom - I can't wait to order more books.	2002-12-29

I enjoyed Sarah Susanka's other books for their beautiful pictures, hopeful text, and &quot;its so easy, it just takes thinking out of the box&quot; attitude. I was hopeful that this book was aimed more for people like me - a simple homeowner looking for some tips (as opposed to an architect or person designing their own home).  While there are some &quot;not so big&quot; solutions for everyday living, such as thinking about your recycling area and making use of space under the stairs, there really isn't anything new or awe-inspiring in this book.  Much of the book still has to do with initial design of the space, and other big money expenditures.  I still rated this book 4 stars as it is a beautiful, eye-catching read, but the information can also be found on HGTV.	2002-12-29

Emergent curriculum is the idea that the themes and activities which happen in a preschool program should center on the  interests of the children.  FOr teachers who already have this child-centered philosophy, this book is an enjoyable read and an important step in moving towards the Project Approach.  For those who are used to teaching with a theme-a-week, pre-written lesson plans (or something similar), this book takes you on a journey of transformation in a very relaxed way.  As an early childhood teacher for over 15 years, this is the book that is first on my recommendations for teachers or programs wishing to provide high quality education.  It is an easily readable book, mixing good practice with real characters for a book which at times reads like a good novel.	2002-12-28

In The Cranefly Orchid Murders, Victoria  still happens upon the first dead body, but the rest of plot involves her skills and pluckiness in a more natural way.  There is more mystery to this book, and some enjoyable exchanges among the varied groups vying for the 200 acres of prime real estate which lead to the murders.

Jason's character reminded me of Dave Eggers in \\"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius\\", which I also enjoyed.<BR>I found it easy to follow the who's who of characters and enough of a mystery to keep you trying to guess until the end.	2002-03-10

Through the lens of the Reggio Emilia philosophy, the book looks at &quot;the image of the child&quot;, &quot;the role of the teacher&quot;, environment, documentation, relationships, curriculum, aesthetics, and finally &quot;the Hundred Languages of Children&quot;.  It is a highly enjoyable read, rich with real life examples of Reggio in practice, as well as the reality of the challenges faced by teachers.  Wonderful!!	2002-03-10

Although there was the occasional astute observation, most of the chapters were just completely made up and abit too tongue in cheek for me.  There was nothing real for a person to sink their teeth into and laugh with true recognition.   As a year rounder, I might enjoy reading this as a column in the MV Times, but was disappointed by the book.	2002-03-10

I couldn't wait to get my hands on a mystery book based on Martha's Vineyard that wasn't by Phillip Craig (good reading, but enough is enough...). This book is a nice change from J.W. (the hero in Craig's books)and the writing more complex, but I would still classify this story as a light summer read. The book begins with a mysterious scream, heard, apparently, only by our heroine Victoria Trumbull. More coincidences occur in Victoria Trumbull's presence, which was abit unrealistic, although not uncommon to real life in a small community. I enjoyed Cynthia Riggs descriptions of the island and characterizations of the people (although I quickly became annoyed at Harbormaster Domingo's abundant use of the word &quot;Sweetheart&quot;!) If you are a fan of the Vineyard, Philip Craig, or light mysteries, you may enjoy this book	2001-08-18

Although I purchased this book specifically because Susan Klein grew up on Martha's Vineyard (an island I adore), I fell in love with it for the childhood she describes.  Many of the short stories (some only a page) describe the idyllic childhood of days gone by - when a 5 year old could ride her new bike unsupervised, and older children  formed teams to play strategic games for hours on end.  But Susan Klein does a remarkable job of encapsulating all that growing up entails - the  real and the imagined pains of childhood, as well as the joy. She touches upon so many subjects that you might mistakenly think it is a heavy read - broken families, religion, the challenge of making ends meet.  But mostly it is a collection of stories that will warm your heart, and sometimes make you laugh outloud. Now, if only there were a sequel so I would know what happened to her best friend David...	2001-08-18

I found this book hard to get into at first, and needed to go back and re-read to get the feel for each of the characters who tell this story.  But once it got going, I couldn't put it down - and it is a big book to get through in one sitting!	2001-08-18
US	50794465	R54YTITAGGU7Y	0446677310	97741819	Eternal Journey	Books	4	0	0	N	Y	enjoyable, touching story	I have to agree with Harriet Klausner's use of the word &quot;shmaltzy&quot; in her review, as opposed to the others  describing it as deeply meaningful, poignant and heart wrenching. However, I have not been closely affected by breast cancer, as is the main character in this story.  Rather, I came upon this novel because of my love for Martha's Vineyard, and to that end it was an enjoyable read, reminsicent of &quot;Way of the Peaceful Warrior&quot; by Dan Millman, without being such an obvious lesson in learning about yourself.	2001-08-18

Although this little book does offer brief advice on many aspects of planning a wedding, it focuses mostly on  the arrangements of bridal party and the formal church wedding ceremony.   Any bride who has purchased a wedding planning book will have all this information, and in  more detail.   In the Author's Note's, she  describes one purpose of the book as &quot;[to] give a wedding committee member a method on how to direct&quot;. That might be the most useful purpose for this book.	2001-08-18

This has been the most helpful book as I introduce myself to the Reggio Emilia approach. The author shares her experience as an intern in Reggio in a very readable mix of first person observation, interview, and philosophy.  But maybe more important, she then takes us the next step as she returns to the States and colloborates with a center to incorporate the Reggio philosophy.  The challenges and suggestions are very realistic and helpful.	2001-08-06

This book is a great way to ease yourself into Reggio or to inspire others on your team.  You do not have to be &quot;Reggio inspired&quot; to know that young children love small, collectable items.  They find such wonderful treasures, but classrooms are not often set up to make good use of this &quot;Beautiful Stuff&quot;. This book has great photos and easy to read text showing readers the process that children and staff went through in developing this long term project.  I particularly enjoyed the summaries at the end of each chapter on what the adults learned during the process.  My only complaint would be that I wanted MORE!	2001-08-06

To read many of the reviews, you might think this was a lengthy volume of work, in order for it to &quot;take us around the world&quot;.   It does it's job in as few words as possible, and can be read easily to young children or savored.  A child in my preschool class recently shared this book and I am now ordering it as a &quot;must have&quot; for my classroom. Particularly required if you live in or near New York City.	2001-06-03

What I liked most about this book are all the things that the other reviews are using against it. True, many of the characters are not fully developed, but they don't have to be. Isn't that how it is in real life - many people are important in your life for brief periods? Or you only have a work relationship with them? Most things in life are not nicely concluded at the end of the chapter, including child abuse. I was NOT in anyway left hanging . Instead, I ended the book thinking, yes, that is really how life can be.By the way, it was not a sad ending, given all the turmoil! : )	2000-04-09
