Godzilla on My  Mind is an impressive, well written discussion of the impact Japan's (and the world's) favorite rampaging movie monster has made on the film industry and pop culture in general. The author thoroughly reviews all aspects of the Godzilla phenomenon (the Godzilla films are the longest series of movies in history -50 years old !!!)and tries to answer the question \\"Why do people love Godzilla so much?\\". It is an entertaining and affectionate look at a cherised character. A must read for any Godzilla fan.	2004-11-02

Plain and simple !	<br />Alton Brown's new book \\"I'm Just Here for More Food : Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking\\" is just as great as his first one \\"I'm Just Here for the Food\\". Once again Alton Brown doesn't only tell you what to do he tells you WHY you do something in a recipe. He teaches you techniques and applications, giving you the tools to create your own recipes. A normal cookbook gives you detailed instructions you follow like a robot. Alton Brown's cookbooks instruct you how to achieve a type of cooking (or in the case of this book baking) result. Knowing the how and why of doing something allows you the freedom to apply what you learn creatively. There are plenty of great recipes in this book but they should be used to understand the technique primarily.  <br /> <br />I say this with all honesty...both of Alton Brown's cookbooks are MUST haves for any aspiring chef. They are superb teaching tools. They are a great gift for someone who wants to learn how to cook. <br /> <br />Highly, highly recommended!!!!! <br />	2004-11-02

The Christ Clone Trilogy is easily one of the best fiction stories I've ever read. The final book in the trilogy, Acts of God, ends the story with the force of a knock out punch. BeauSeigneur slowly increases the tension to the breaking point, culminating in the final battle between good and evil. And what a battle it is! Sides are chosen and only the people who chose wisely prevail. The last book hurtles the reader to the final confrontation at a breakneck speed...and the reader gladly goes along for the ride. <br />A fantastic ending to a stunning series of books. Who is this guy James BeauSeigneur and why isn't he writing more books!!!	2004-05-20

Book two of &quot;The Christ Clone&quot; trilogy is better than the first. The beginning of the end has started and no one knows who to turn to for salvation. Who will stop the tribulations. Who will lead humanity through the horrors sent to them? Is Christopher Goodman the person to do it...or not?<br />This book contans some of the best written scenes of destruction ever put to paper. As the final plagues hit the Earth James Beauseignuer paints a realistic picture of the gruesome events man faces. These sequences are so vivid they rival anything in the best written horror novels (there is a scence invovling an asteroid that has some of the most gripping writing I've ever read!) The suffering the people go through is palpable. A great setup for the conclusion.	2004-05-13

I came across this title as I was reading the mediocre reviews for the Left Behind series. For whatever reason I was in the mood to read an \\"End of Days\\" novel (who knows why?). I found the concept of \\"In His Image\\" intriguing so I ordered the book. After finishing it I can say it is a fantastic read; thoroughly researched, fast paced, and very suspenseful. In all honesty I was expecting an average piece of fundamentalist propaganda disguised as a fiction piece. Instead the book truly did read like a Tom Clancy novel but with a realistic science fiction edge to it. What impressed me with the story was how convincing the world politics parts of the story were handled. Everything in the book seems very plausible in today's geo-political climate. Even the theory/story behind the cloning of Jesus was somewhat believable.<br />After reading the first third of the book I went out and ordered books 2 and 3. That's how good I think it is. In fact I'll probably read them back-to-back. Highly recommended.<br />PS I'm not hardcore religious but I know that there are people who are. If those people are offended at the cloning concept of the book I respectfully request that you give the book a shot (even if you approach it as a pure science fiction novel). I think you'll be entertained.	2004-04-28

Dave Eggers is definitely a witty writer but this memoir is just a jumble of different ideas that never lend themselves to a common theme. The sad part is that this book had so much potential to be great. If Eggers had concentrated his writing on the dynamic between himself and his 10-year-old brother (who Eggers became guardian of when he was 22 years old after the death of both parents) the book would have been great. I found that aspect of the story most compelling. <br />Instead you get stream of conscious prose detailing uninteresting events (even for a 20 something).<br />I found it to be a waste of material.	2004-03-17

Since Dawn of the Dead was one of my favorite horror movies I bought this book for a goof. After reading it I can honestly say this is one of the best horror novels I've read in a long, long time. I could not put it down. It has great zombie action, fast pacing, horrifying vision, and interesting characters. It is a great read that leaves you wanting more at the end (I hear there is a sequel coming out in the fall...I will buy it immediately). If Brian Keene's other books are half as good as this one then they will be very enjoyable. <br />Recommended !	2004-03-10
US	53024638	R2XDJD52BCBXVG	0930289234	777411096	Watchmen	Books	1	43	227	N	N	Quite disappointed.	I was quite disappointed with Watchmen. I had heard so many great things about it and was expecting a memorable read. Now that I have read it I'm left with a feeling of \\"What was the big deal?\\".  The story was incredibly average. The art was mediocre at best. Alan Moore's writing is eloquent but an eloquently written boring story is still boring. I was expecting a lot more.<br />Three GREAT examples of graphic novels at their best are: Kingdom Come by Alex Ross, the Rising Stars series by J.Michael Straczynski, and The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller.	2004-01-16

Great action sequences, believable characters, and an intricate plot make The Last Jihad an excellent thriller. If his next novel is a good we make have another Clancy on our hands.<br />My one critique of the book (and it's a trivial one) is this: in an attempt to keep the novel \\"clean\\", and not use profanity, the author has characters use curse substitutes such as \\"freaking\\". At those moments, when the emotions in the scene run high, the use of these substitutes somehow makes the scene lose credibility. For that split second (when for example a hardened, battle worn intelligence officer is shaking down a possible terrorist in a rage and uses the word \\"freaking\\") the reader is reminded that he's reading a book and is brought out from being totally immersed in a scene.<br />Overall one on the better novels I've read in a long while. Highly recommended.	2003-09-26

Much better than Red Rabbit (that's not saying much). A fast paced, suspenseful read. My only critique of the book is that it should have been fleshed out a little more. It needed about 50 more pages of character development, background, and depth to make it as satisfying as it should have been. Probably the fault of an overzealous editor trying to correct the mistakes made in Red Rabbit. Who knows? <br />Overall a good read but below Tom Clancy standards	2003-09-09

Instead the book is confusing and plotless. I found myself being quite bored reading this piece of fluff. The horror sequences seem to be written for pure shock value instead of serving the story (in those rare times when you can figure out what is going on).<br />Don't waste your time. Read something by Stephen King, Douglas Clegg, Clive Barker, or Robert Mccammon instead. They are worth your time.	2003-03-27

The government should issue this book to everyone once they reach the age of majority. That way everyone will learn the proper, proven, and correct way to cook using various techniques. This book is like a one on one course with a master chef. After reading the book and implementing the cooking methods as described in the book you will be a master of all the basic cooking techniques you'll ever require. The world of cooking will be open to you. I'm not kidding! This book clearly and concisely walks you through many cooking methods (grilling, braising, boiling, roasting, sautéing, etc) allowing you to understand why one method gets one result and another gets a different one. The instructions are informative and presented in a humorous way (much like Alton Brown's Good Eats show on the Food Network). I have bought many cookbooks over the years but this is the one that has taught me the most. And the recipes are excellent as well.<br /> It's easy to look at a recipe and follow it. It's another thing to have techniques in your cooking arsenal and use them to create your own (or replicate) recipes.<br />This book is a must for new cooks and is highly recommend for anybody who enjoys cooking.<br />Also recommended: Any books by Nick Stellino, Emeril Lagasse, or Jacques Pepin.	2003-03-27

Hexes is an dark, suspensful descent into a world where demons walk the earth...and men wield dark magic to protect the innocent. A cross between Silece of the Lambs and It, the book keeps you interested in the whole chain of events that takes place (both past and present).<br />My only complaint about the book is that it's too short for the story. If Tom Piccirilli wrote about 100 more pages, and gave more information about the backstory I would have given it 5 stars.	2002-11-25

It is well paced, has many truly horrific moments, and keeps the supernatural suspense at a razors edge. It also is a very heartfelt, emotional book (you can't help feel sorry for the main character as his life becomes unwound).

A great story line, well developed characters, fantastic artwork, and JMS's engrossing writing makes Rising Stars a true classic. The story is written with such authenticity and emotional depth you are drawn into the world of \\"The Specials\\". It's a real thinking persons comic (but don't think it's all dialogue...there are great battles and superhero action sequences in every issue !).  <br />I think JMS did a great job in portraying what would happen if ordinary people were given great powers. Who would use it for Evil? Who would use it for Good?  Would the world embrace these \\"Specials\\" or fear them? JMS lays out a world where all these ideas are explored. Rising Stars is a comic that exemplifies all the qualities of great comics.<br />Highly recommended !<br />Also recommended: Anything by J.

If only because I was interested in the behind the scenes action of the &quot;sport&quot;. <br />I was astonished by this book. It is so well written, it flows so well, and it is so funny, that I finished it in 5 days (and for me to finish a 700+page book in that time is a testament to how captivating it is). Mick Foley is simply brilliant. Some of the stories were so funny I was laughing out loud. Some of the fight descriptions were so brutal I was amazed at the punishment Mick Foley went through in the name of entertainment(unbelievable punishment...but true!).I highly recommend this book to anyone ,wrestling fan or not. <br />Well done and Bravo Mick!!!!
