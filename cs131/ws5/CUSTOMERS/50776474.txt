Write more good books. Not just do too much out-sourcing or sub-contracting in writing.<br />Practice the Law of the Harvest that he always preaches. He will reap what he has sowed.	2004-01-07

Congratulations to the authors! They had written an excellent, practical, and realistic book on Life Balancing.Probably the best book on life leadership since 7 Habits and First Things First (actually even better than &quot;F£ÔF&quot;, since the writing style and selection of ancedotes and examples are even more mature and veteran).<br />Congratulations to the readers! We have a chance to read an excellent book on personal/family development, well presented in the 7 Habits/Covey's tradition, but in a less wordy, theoretical, and jargons-filled way.<br />Both authors are very sincere, writing and sharing usefulideas<BR>from their hearts. They talked about Money Matrix, See Do Get Model, and many useful skillsets for balancing.<br />They didn't just repeat old ideas from First Things First. Instead, they injected a lot of new ideas and useful wisdoms about life into the book. Very unlike Stephen R. Covey, who is very idle in using new materials and new ideas in his so called new books. He is just so repetitive and wordy sometimes that readers can be turned off by his lack of inventiveness in terms of both form and substance in his new books.<br />Of course, Life Matters also has its weaknesses . It deals with Work, Family, Time, Money, and Wisdom Literature on Life Balancing. But it didn't mention the word, Health in the book even once, or didn't even mention the importance of Spirituality, by which both are essential elements in human life.<br />Since health is wealth, there will be no Work, Family, Time, Money, Wisdom, or Spirituality, when people fail to prioritize Health in their life.<br />In an overall sense, this is a great book that I cannot put down. If more personal development books can be written with Life Matter's type of quality, the readers will benefit-- the society will ultimately be benefited.<br />My sincere thanks and salute to the authors! This book will be a Mega best-seller, just like 7 Habits or First Things First...<BR>Just wait and see!	2003-06-30

Covey is also in the audio program, with both other Frankin Covey's associates inside as well.<br />This program updated Frankin Covey's previous What Matters Most program, and has added a lot of additional perspectives on integrating PDA, Window Outlook, and Paper-based planning tools.<br />This program has its value. The previous 2 comments in this customer review have not provided a fair, in-depth look at this new program.

I was totally intrigued and engaged by this self-help book, just by reading the excerpt of the book provided by Amazon.<br />There is no doubt that I will buy the book, sit down, and read it!<br />This book really has an impact on me, at least initially, before I read the entire book. The impact is just as big as Covey's 7 Habits.<br />The book has a new focus--Energy, not Time to drive people to excel physically, mentally, socially, and spiritually.<br />Actually, this book has a similar uderpinning like 7 Habits, except the two books took different routes, styles, metaphors or analogies to present the materials.<br />Throughout the years, I have read a number of personal development books. I have been positively addicted to this type of performance enhancing books. More or less, I have been overdosed with positive messages, and try to practice what I have learned from all these \\"positive dosages\\".<br />I must say that not all new books on personal development these days deserved to be read or bought, including Covey's new books in recent years. Most of them are either unmeaningful line extensions of some so-called motivational gurus' work. Some are just cliche--repeating old ideas or content on personal development.<br />Read this book. You will find a lot of new insights, and will benefit from it in this worldwide economic downtime.<br />Trust the authors! I read some of their previous books.

He can be a bit wordy. He goes around in saying things that are actually very simple and common sensical. As a Time Management and Productivity Expert, he should save his time and his readers' time as well.<br />Personally, I don't think this book offers breakthrough paradigm in time management. I agreed that Frankin Covey's time management approach can be a bit dated in the&quot;Idea Economy&quot;. But still Frankin Covey's approach has a more broad base usage, whereas Allen's approach is more micro---emphasizing too much on personal organization like organizing files, cabinets, etc.<br />Anyhow, I see Allen's book as the supplementary to Frankin Covey's books rather than the &quot;driving force&quot; work in the field.	2003-04-27

Philip Kotler is a strong personal brand in the marketing field. He has aggressively launched many marketing books in recent years in order to build on--- leverage on his personal brand equity as one of the \\"top-edge marketing gurus\\"in the world. <br />But gurus definitely need to have breakthrough ideas in their fields in order to back their gurus' status up.<br />There is nothing new and exciting from a book written by a marketing guru here who bragged himself as professional in the marketing field for forty years in the Preface of the book.<br />I do understand that this book targets at more junior or middle management levels managers either in the marketing field or the related or non-related fields. However, this book is too basic, assuming that the aforesaid managers are just so naive, ignorant or green about marketing. A lot of information in the book can be sourced from the internet Free of Charge easily!<br />What Philip Kotler wrote in this book is more like Cliff Notes, presenting an oversimplified view about marketing in a hypercompetitive marketing world these days.<br />In addition, most of the ideas in the book are not originated by Philip Kotler himself. He has read a lot of business or marketing bestsellers. No doubt about it! It seems like he has just completed a less than 200 pages book report, and has synthesized a lot of cute, but not necessarily practical marketing ideas in a well-packaged, best-seller format fashion.<br />As an educated guess, I assume this book was written by Philip Kotler within no more than 3 months. Besides, there are some errors in the book,including: P.192--\\"Good to Great\\" should be written by James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras, not James Champy, etc.<br />As a marketing guru, Philip Kotler should be more keen on raising higher scholarly standard and launching more good quality marketing books, rather than keen on being\\" quick fix\\"--- launching a lot of new books, but sacrificing his brand reputation and solid academicbackground.<br />On the whole, this book is very textbook and good for university students like Freshman.... The marketing prescriptions are too predictable and filled with conventional wisdom, if not insights.<br />As a long-standing consumer of Kotler's books, this is a little piece of customer feedback for the marketing guru to reflect and improve on......	2003-04-20

Only by reading the excerpt of this book has already convinced me to get a copy of this new book, and JUST READ IT!<br />As a person who got his formal education both from the East and the West, this book provides the bridge in connecting the &quot;beauties&quot; of both the Eastern and the Western styles of thinking.<br />To me, Western people are relatively more left-brain dominant (rational!), whereas Eastern people are relatively more right- brain dominent (intuitive!).<br />This book once again tries to prove the abovesaid contention, while providing sufficient MSA--Metaphors,Stories,and Anecdotes(historical, of course!) to back up its contention.<br />This book is very well written and can provide readers a lot of Aha and Haha experiences, understanding where the conflicts between the Eastern and the Western people really arise?<br />But there is one precaution here!<br />Don't over-generalize how the East and the West think differently. Some Eastern people got their education from the West could have tuned their thinking style into more Western style, or vice versa.<br />This book is a good starting point to shed light on how the East and West should respect each other and understand their cultural differences in terms of thinking and living.<br />I enjoyed reading this book very much....	2003-04-17

I read the 1st edition, but that was a bit too academic. This time academic too, but less technical.<br />Cases on a number of world-class brands are already worth the dollars. That include Amazon.com, Nike, Virgin, Microsoft, IBM, and plenty of them.<br />This book is even more comprehensive than Branding Gurus David Aaker's Branding books. But I must admit that this book touches upon too little on e-branding, and its impact on online \\"brand consumption\\". Besides, Keller's branding paradigm needs to be updated. He got to invent his own new theory rather than drawing too much upon others' branding theories which makes this book both the Branding Bible (like Kotler's Marketing textbook for MBAs), and a thick book report.<br />On the whole, this book is great, it won't waste your hard-earned dollars, and Keller's diligent researcher attitude must be honoured and respected, by all means.<br />Great work, Keller, keep it up!	2002-11-15

One merit of this book is that, at least, it challenges<BR>the conventional wisdom concerning Corporate Creativity. It<BR>encourages readers to instill positive conflicts in Brainstorming<BR>Sessions. It encourages readers to play around with stupid ideas<BR>before coming up with something useful.<br />Most of Sutton's ideas are well packaged and delivered, but they<BR>cannot be easily applied in the Age of Corporate Downsizing and<BR>Job Insecurity. In addition, not only most Old Economy Companies ( rather than New Economy Companies) will find the recommended ideas hard to be applied in the real world settings, most non-Western companies in the East will also find those ideas not easy to be applied in a relatively more conservative and less free flow<BR>work setting in the oriental countries.<br />For reality check reasons, readers can try out Sutton's ideas<BR>within a week at work, and see what will happen. Guess they will<BR>find his ideas cute but weak in real world applications.

Probably the worst book ever written by the integrated marketing communications guru, Don E. Schultz -- an IMC professor at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern.<br /> It is too conceptual and theoretical. The real world does not really do IMC quite like that. IMC is still both art and science. The author(s) tend to look at IMC, from a branding perspective, in a dry,boring, and uncreative fashion.Many jargons have been invented in the book. But are they really practical? The book has not thrown in enough cases or examples to explain or illustrate most of the untested theories or concepts convincingly.<br /> Personally, I guess Beth E. Barnes did most of the writing, and Don E. Schultz did most of the so called new concepts or theories invention.<br /> I recommend books like Experiental Marketing, Experience Economy-- they are far more interesting, and practical!	2000-09-29

It has  borrowed some useful ideas directly or indirectly from SPIN Selling, and  Non-Manipulative  Selling, which are the &quot; real classics&quot; in the  field.<br /> The ORDER model on selling as suggested in the book is also  sound.<br /> However, personally I still like SPIN Selling better because it  is more   practical, concise, and less conceptual in writing .<br /> Try SPIN  Selling and Non-manipulative Selling before you read  this book. You will  have more paradigm shift experiences.  <br /> To look back, I think books on  selling by Brian Tracy, Tom Hopkins, and the like are less useful or  heavyweight for the 21st Century because the buyers have become more  sophisticated, and have already read a lot of books on selling themselves.  To influence the buyers positively and effectively, the sellers must first  equip themselves with cutting-edge, unpredictable selling skills. For this  reason, you must read SPIN Selling first before you read this book.<br />  Trust me !	2000-09-20

This is an excellent book.<br /> Well-researched.

It is a facts book. A bit too long-winded  to get the  main message across.<br /> Most of the ideas are cliche. Words like  &quot;Leading&quot; and   &quot;Revolution&quot; are catchy, but  overused.<br /> Nowadays, a lot of academic business consultants are running    out of new things to say. So they have to keep on repackaging  old ideas,  and coming up with new jargons to fool themselves  and others, assuming  that they are creating the new paradigms  in business management!<br /> Time  to wake up, and get real.	2000-09-15

Parnes is a real creativity guru !	Sidney J. Parnes helped refine Alex F. Osborn's Creative  Problem Solving  philosophy after Osborn passed away.<br /> Osborn wrote the landmark book on  Brainstorming called Applied  Imagination, while Sidney J. Parnes also  wrote a number of  influential books in this area, including editing this  one here.<br /> While Edward De Bono, Tony Buzan, Howard Gardner, and Osborn  may  be better known in the field, Sidney J. Parnes' writing is just   as  solid, or sometimes, even better to read.<br /> Read this book, if you want to  get a better picture about  creative thinking, and learn the real stuff!	2000-08-31

Basically,I think this book has good intention. It emphasizes more  on&quot; Strategic Doing&quot; rather than on &quot;Strategic  Thinking&quot;. It is a wake-up call for the management theorists, business  consultants, and business leaders in replacing empty talks with more down  to earth actions.<br />I think the entire management industry (including  business schools,business books publishers, and the so-called management  gurus,etc.) is becoming unhealthy.There are so many management courses,  seminars, or workshops ,so many business books, and so many management  gurus--- most with old wine, but new bottles.<br />Where is the meat? Where is  the beef, by the way? I am sorry to say that even most of the arguments or  ideas stated in Jeffrey and Sutton's book are not very new---actually there  is NO Big Deal! Motivational guru W. Clement Stone, a streetwise,  self-educated person, already wrote a book in 1960s, called Success System  That Never Fails which has already stated out the importance of doing  rather than  just knowing. He has given out a lot of practical advices on  how to become a DO IT NOW PERSON, while emphasizing WHAT IS COMMON SENSE IS  NOT COMMON PRACTICE in a non-theoretical light.<br />In an overall sense, I do  enjoy reading Jeffrey and Sutton's book because they have done a lot of  good academic research -- spending 4 years of their life in verifying a  timeless, common sensical truth---Walking the Talk is always better than  Talking the Talk!	2000-08-21
