Which wasn't born in Amazing Stories but amateur radio magazines run by, you guessed it, Gernsback.  This massive tome about the early days of science fiction (as a genre as we come to think of it now; of course there was Wells and Verne etc) explains a lot about the creative tensions and genre distinctions that are with us to this present day in science fiction. Gernsback is certainly still a polarizing figure in the genre (think of William Gibson's story \\"The Gernsback Continuum\\"); BUT he certainly is more complicated a figure than his detractors would give him credit for. The author, while certainly \\"pro-Gernsback\\", is not fawning either, and you get a good sense of the nascent fan community too.<br /><br />This book lost a star because the typeface was small and very grainy--it was readable, but barely. Which is too bad. Anyone looking to write, or write about, science fiction should read this book.	2005-03-10

First of all, Mr. Aagard has an engaging voice that comes across in the pages. He comes across as a real human being who has had ups and downs with chess. He has a lot of wit and warmth interspersed with very forthright analysis. A rare combination! This does not mean, however, that the book is somehow not serious. Far from it; he has a thesis regarding positional play and he defends it with rigor. He's not &quot;my way or the highway&quot; but at the same time makes a convincing case regarding what it takes to take a quantum leap in playing skill.<br />But wait, there's more: Mr. Aagard's background in neuropsychology takes this book to a new level. He integrates fascinating info about cognition and perception and how it relates to chess. This is stuff that is compelling in its own right. Ultimately, I wouldn't have changed much with this book. It accomplishes exactly what it wants to, and points towards a &quot;humanist&quot; perspective on chess: train hard, but also realize that (a) it's a game between 2 human beings who must respect each other during the course of play, and (b) it's important to have fun. I really think this book will have a long shelf life--it certainly had a deep impact on how I approach the game.	2003-09-23

Matt Labash, a senior writer for the conservative Weekly Standard, recently admitted the following:<br />&quot;We've created this cottage industry in which it pays to be un-objective.... It's a great way to have your cake and eat it too. Criticize other people for not being objective. Be as subjective as you want. It's a great little racket.&quot;<br />The right wing is getting mighty arrogant about their power in the media and shaping the discourse. They don't even bother to lie about it anymore.<br />Alterman's book is a first crucial step in leveling the playing field--not in terms of liberal vs. conservative, but accuracy vs. falsehood, and democracy vs. plutocracy.	2003-06-22

The Sense Record reads as a decided continuation of the poems in Imagination Verses (which, at times, had a feeling of being too much &quot;mask&quot; and not enough &quot;face&quot; if that makes sense), as well as a quantum leap &quot;forward&quot; in vividness, and strength of line. I put &quot;forward&quot; in quotation marks because so much of Moxley's entire body of work is a playful critique of the entire avant-guardist notion of forward progress in the arts in the first place. Not in a conservative manner, of course, but rather in the way that a poem can create its own relationship to a reader by evoking, but not being limited to, a poetic tradition of gesture and utterance. Which is, in a big way, utterly subversive. Poems in The Sense Record that SEEM lyrical have a core to them that refuses a lyrical bent at all. For Moxley, words (esp. &quot;heightened&quot; and &quot;poetic&quot; words) are garments for the mind, to be tried on, with favorites chosen--but who wears the same thing every day? But in the way that clothing, though it hides, reveals the wearer, this book manages, in its anti-revelations, to create relevatory spaces in these poems. And when this occurs--frequently--in this book, the results are breathtaking.<br />The Sense Record is incredible, in the literal use of that word. It stretched the credulity of poetic form itself in order to arrive at the most unexpected emotional resonances. A signal book of poetry for the first decade of the 21st century.	2002-10-18

Nesbitt has a keen ear for dialogue and a killer instinct for using metaphors. The opening story, \\"The Ones Who May Kill You in the Morning\\" is a perfect example--it has a visceral final image that crystallizes in a few sentences explicitly everything that was implicit in the story beforehand. It's one of those moments where you put the book down and let everything sink in for a few minutes.<br />I really can't recommend these stories enough--in the end, they are incredibly moving _because_ of the way Nesbitt plays fast and loose with the countours of reality, not despite it. In the last 10 years there has been an oatmealy sea of sameness in literary fiction--but unconventional, authentic writers like Nesbitt give hope for the future. A _lot_ of hope.	2002-05-01

The cast of characters is continually shuffled around in a landscape that is equal parts real and unreal. (Cairo itself IS a major character in the story.) The results are very entertaining, albeit very dark. The Father of Cats, in particular, is a particularly chilling villian. I read this book for a week, and each night I would read it in bed, before I fell asleep. Although I never had any nightmares from reading the book--the experience of my own drowsiness when reading the book reminded me of the central issues in the book. It teeters between the waking world and the dream world, and the book succeeds brilliantly when the two are indistinguishable.	2001-08-09

It's about &quot;tremors&quot;--the little twinges of doubt and guilt that affect everyone. The question that Highsmith poses is whether her protagonist is going to ignore those tremors, and thus lead something of an amoral (even evil) life. The answer to this is very ambiguous, but in a good way. In many ways this novel reminded me of The Stranger by Albert Camus--the same North African dolor, the same detached protagonist with few moral qualms.<br />The reading was s-l-o-w and a bit dry in places, but oddly alluring and page turning. It propelled me through, even when nothing was &quot;happening&quot;. I don't understand why people said the writing was bad; it was clean and understated. All in all, it's worth picking up--if you're in the mood for some existentialist food for thought.	2001-01-02

Except perhaps from his first book, nearly everything that Levis wrote resonated--he's one of the best, and sadly, one of the most underrated, of the poets of the 80s and 90s. <br />He did this by creating new KINDS of poems; the cadences (particularly in his later books) are singularly his, and tonally the poems can be elegaic, or funny, but they're not just &quot;feelings put on paper.&quot; His poems aren't merely glib, vague confessional prose broken up arbitrarily into lines, as seems to be trendy lately. Tonally they might vary from the elegaic to the absurdly funny--but they are all part of a deep exploration by Levis of human experience. He is often rooted in regional soil (the hardscrabble California vineyards of his childhood) but he is not a &quot;regional&quot; writer; in other words, whatever his experiences in life might be, he uses poetry as a way to transform them, merely than just describe them. He can write a poem about Belgrade, and have the same type of unbounded imagery, rhythms, and lyrical force than he has writing about &quot;home.&quot;<br />Perhaps the greatest poems here are the Elegies from his last book, in which the elegies themselves become kind of semiautonomous creatures in of themselves (the titles say much to this regard: &quot;Elegy with a Thimbleful of Water in the cage,&quot; &quot;Elegy with a Petty Thief in the Rigging,&quot; &quot;Elegy with an Angel inside its gate,&quot; etc), and are probably the best sequence of poems I've seen in a long long time.<br />In short, this is a fine introduction to Levis's work--but if you're hooked, you're going to want all of his books anyway (most of which are thankfully in-print by both Pittsburgh and Carneige Mellon). It has been awfully hard to pin down in words what makes his work so special, because in many ways, just like his poems, it defies easy categorization. His poems don't necessarily provide nice morals at the end; they aren't sugar-coated. But I can't think of another poet--even Sylvia Plath, whose work I love--who I regret (grieve, really) had died an early death. With any luck a hundred years from now people will be reading, passionately, Levis's work.	2000-12-17

I take that partially back--in _Justine_, the city IS language. His lush and tactile descriptions become as real as bricks and mortar in the reader's mind. The Alexandria of this novel hums, crackles, simmers...sometimes it devours the characters who choose to live there, sometimes it gives them moments of epiphany. But reading this novel, you will, yourself, become a kind of resident of this unreal city. You will follow with fondness and sadness the minor characters who give this novel so much texture. You will soak up the cadences of Durrell's prose in creating this city. Justine, Nessim, and the rest of the flawed, though achingly poignant characters will haunt your reading of this novel in one fashion or another. They will seem to you like people you have known in real life--who HASN'T had a topsy-turvy lover in their lives?-- but at the same time take on properties of something out of Greek theatre. The characters are realistic and yet are greater than the sum of their parts. I can't wait to read the next three novels in the Alexandria Quartet. This book will truly endure. It has set off firecrackers in my brain.	2000-11-25

The prose poem is indeed its own bird, an evolutionary strain SIMILAR to poetry, and SIMILAR to prose, but not exactly like either. The prose poem, when done well (as most of those exhibited in this anthology are), is not a formless blob. It has its own rhythms and cadences--oftentimes more 'invisible' that give the pieces structure.<br />Of course, there is great variety to what's presented here. Some are very narrative, and some are elliptical. They're fun to dive into. Highly recommended if you're looking for something off-beat, poetrywise.	2000-11-12

Although I have a few caveats, for the most part this novel kept me  riveted. The worldbuilding is excellent. I felt wholly immersed in the  world of paralines, the Call, and the Calculor (in essence, a modern  computer mimiced by thousands of people doing the calculating functions  rather than electronic processors). Too often in epics like this there is a  monoculture, and everything is painted in Good Society vs. Evil Society.  But everything, here, is blended in shades of gray. The heros have serious  flaws and limitations, and you always at least understand the motivations  of the villans, even if you dislike them.<br />With that said, there were  some places where I looked up from the book, quizzically, and had serious  questions about the direction that McMullen was going. First of all--major  characters CONTINUALLY kept bumping into each other, even after travelling  great distances! This really stretched credibility at some points; I mean,  come on, this is Australia, not Rhode Island. Secondly, the book has a  weird take on slavery. I understand that the author is trying to depict a  culture that is alien from our own, but...I don't know, it made me  uncomfortable and squeamish at times when the underlying theme was  &quot;slavery is ok if it furthers the advance of society.&quot; I  understand that this is fiction, and certainly the author is NOT advocating  slavery, but--be warned. There is one point in particular where a  particular group of slaves are released and they all say in essence,  &quot;No! We like being slaves! Take us back!&quot; Now--would EVERY one of  these particular slaves say this? I think not, but this is what McMullen  writes. Kind of creepy if you ask me. Lastly (although this isn't a fault  of the book per se), the jacket text has to be the absolute worst I ever  read, and definitely cast a pallor in the beginning of reading the book. It  was as if whoever wrote this jacket text had no clue what the book was  about. Of course, I know some people ignore these altogether but I tend to  use the jacket text as something of an anchor for the first few chapters of  a novel.<br />In some, I definitely recommend this book, and while I don't  think the qualms I had with it will be shared with everyone, in my mind  these flaws prevent this book from being rated a classic, a la Hyperion,  Dune, or Book of the New Sun.hoever wrote this jacket text had no clue what the book was  about.

What I loved most about this novel was that Sade was a deeply  HUMAN figure--he wasn't some caricature of himself. The dream sequences and  hallucinations blend together with 'actual' events, and the novel is  peppered with recipes, feasts, fans, escapades, and more than a few lessons  on the follies of colonialism. I especially liked how the author was trying  to make a parallel between the brutal colonization of the native peoples of  the New World with the way that the dour leaders (keepers of 'public  morality') of the French revolution were trying to 'colonize' (in other  words, fence in and control) the imagination of Sade and those close to  him. If I had one complaint with the novel, it would be the ending...I just  wish it had a LITTLE more narrative force and conclusiveness to it. But  otherwise, this book is a highly recommended piece of literature; you don't  read it as much as experience and interact with its sensuality.	2000-07-10

Our Mutual Friend, his last novel, shows some decidedly modernist techniques and situations that were very much ahead of their time.  This novel would have been at home if written  in, say, the early twentieth century.  The twin images of the River and of  Garbage (not just decay and dust, but also recycling and renewal) permeate  the beginning of this book, and carry through with characters that don't  fall into easy categories.  All of the requisite Dickensian elements are  here, but the reader is also presented with an ending that is both an  epiphany and a recognition that the story REALLY doesn't end, after all;  storytellers just move onto different subjects.  In other words, there  isn't the neat bow at the end of the novel that is so prevalent in  Victorian literature--one more reason this novel remains somewhat apart  from Dickens' other works, while at the same time being a fresh, engaging  read.  Probably not the best work to begin with, if you're new to Dickens,  but if you have the rhythm of his prose down from other, shorter works,  you'll certainly enjoy the greater complexities of Our Mutual Friend.	2000-04-29

It's hard to necessarily put all the pieces together with this intense exploration of gender roles, but it's a  puzzle, nonetheless, that will stick with the reader for a long time to  come.  Ultimately, this book (as explained in the seminal introduction to  this novel Le Guin provides) isn't about some far off planet in time and  space.  It's about US, and how we perceive and act on gender roles we've  inherited.  Of course, those theories wouldn't mean much if the prose  wasn't sparse and vivid, the characters weren't engaging (even when  extremely strange), and the planet this takes place on wasn't realistic.  Thankfully, LeGuin supercedes these criterea for an excellent  novel--groundbreaking when it was published, as essential as ever today.	2000-04-26

Otherwise, this is a highly-charged jaunt through all sorts of locales,  virtual and otherwise. The first few chapters alone are worth the price of  admission.  This is a great book to give to someone who says &quot;I don't  like to read science fiction&quot; (and yet that person will watch science  fiction blockbusters all summer at the movies, hmmm, never did figure that  one out).  What will draw these new readers in is Stephenson's wild ideas  of the future--it doesn't matter whether the futuristic ideas presented  (like burbclaves) will come true or not (although many think we already  live in a Snow Crash-esque world already).  The point is that they're FUN,  and not dumbed down--Stephenson provides a feast of visual sensations that  are enthralling, and not just for techies or Trekkies.	2000-04-26

I can't think of higher praise, actually, for a book of this type: a brisk, engaging, I-can't-put-this-down type of read coupled with some serious metaphysical  chops.  The ragged crew of protagonists are all extremely intriguing as  character studies as they go galavanting around the globe looking for  spiritual enlightenment.  The fact that they are a little bit mercenary  (especially the rakish Coyote Blu) only adds to the charm of the novel  (even when it's a very VIOLENT charm, I might add).  In some ways this  reminded me of Eco's fine novels, or even Pavic's Dictionary of the  Khazars, but what Kotler brings to the table is a cinematic style of prose.  It might seem off-putting and glib at first, but give it a chance, it  tends to grow on you (yes, the characters quip a lot, but there are some  one line zingers as well).  The only flaw I could find in the book is that  the characters smoke and drink (alcohol and coffee) all the time; not that  I'm against that, mind you, but sometimes I felt that the author was using  that as a prop when he didn't know what his character wanted to do in terms  of body language.  Other than that, though, this book is a crazy textual  labyrinth, milking to the fullest the delights of both weird metaphysics  AND a taut, Steve McQueen-esque thriller.	2000-04-16

The breadth and scope of Eco's vision is unbelievable in this novel, but none of that would be worth a farthing if his characters weren't engaging, even when they had flaws.  Ultimately, this novel is about  belief--by the dizzying end you're not sure what to believe, which is,  perhaps, the point.  When some people talk of postmodern literature they  use it as a negative attribute, without realizing just how FUN a novel of  this caliber can be.  This is a well-wrought page turner that uses  postmodern techniques to enhance, rather than obscure, the narrative.	2000-04-02

I have to admit I hit a speed bump in the middle of reading this one; the plot was getting mired and the climax seemed nowhere in sight. HOWEVER, that's about the only flaw I could find with this exquisite, haunting book.  This family saga (a Canadian gothic?), full of secrets and complications,  is beautifully and powerfully written by the author--and it's all the more  stunning considering she deals with some very tough material.  Many of the  characters aren't likeable per se but as the family struggles through their  anguished pasts, you're caught up in the struggle too.

However, when I finished it, I was left  with a feeling of something being incomplete.  I felt that the author was  cramming the story of the geisha into the confines of a conventional  western romance novel.  The ending was more like Austen than, say,  Tanazaki.  There's nothing wrong with Austen at all, but I wasn't exactly  expecting _Sense and Sensibility_-esque touches in this particular novel.  Also the author's prose didn't have the sparseness that I perhaps expected.  Also, the author whisked away the darker side of the geisha world with too  much ease, especially with the obsessions of beauty and cruelty.  This is a  good bedside read but I think it's a little thin for a book discussion  group (which is where I encountered it).	2000-01-17

This is good writing, period, and makes distinctions between 'young adult' and 'adult' categories meaningless. The predicament the children face in this novel is an amplified version of what anyone feels at one point in their life and the blending of realism and the weirder elements was also seamless. This also deals with sibling rivalry, competition, and exploitation by powerful people of those unable to really defend themselves. The surprise that slowly unfolds at the end kept me glued to my seat. It's not exactly a cheerful book. But in this slim volume, rather than being a flight of fancy, it raises difficult questions that have no easy answers. Which by the way is the hallmark of much compelling literature, SF or otherwise: challenging our assumptions instead of confirming what we already believe through escapism. To make a long story short, I can't recommend this book more.	2000-01-16

These poems, when I was an  undergrad, changed the way I THOUGHT about poetry, what it could  accomplish. Nearly devoid of literary pretentions, Simic's poetry is  nonetheless artful, using slang, riddles and the like to construct his  worlds-within-poems.  Simic later wrote a book called Dimestore Alchemy on  the work of Joseph Cornell and I couldn't think of a better description  than 'dimestore alchemy' for his own poetry. Few books are essentials, but  this is one of them, a certified desert-island book for poets and lovers of  poetry.	2000-01-09

The prose is sinuous and reflective, and reflects on much more than sex and science fiction writing.  The cast of 'walk ons' in Delany's life is astounding; including Bob  Dylan, W.H. Auden, and Albert Einstein (yes, Einstein).  The poet Marilyn  Hacker, his wife at the time, plays a prominent role in these pages and  indeed Delany is one of the astutest critics of poets that I've read, which  is all the more astounding since it's one of his very minor concerns!  Delany is a major--and one of the tragically under-rated--figures in  American literature--and this book not only shows the genesis of his  writing, but cements his place in its own right.	2000-01-02

It has interesting tidbits that illuminate his prose and the 'chronicle of early failure' is indeed harrowing and interesting. yet, unlike most of Auster's prose, this  account never trandescends itself; that is, it doesn't achieve the  luminescence of the prose that Auster is capable of.  There was a LOT of  filler near the end of the book too (did we really need to see the Action  Baseball game?)  A far better account of the starving artist routine is  Samuel Delany's _The Motion of Light in Water_	1999-12-11

His work seems to be the current darling of 'accessible' poetry, the kind of poetry that NPR listeners who don't know  much about poetry can name-drop at non-profit fundraisers.Don't get me  wrong--this type of poetry has its place and there are some poems i really  liked in here.  There's an East Asian clarity to his sense of line, and  some of these poems are truly pleasurable.  But, really. This work isn't  covering any new territory and it's not the greatest thing since sliced  bread.	1999-12-07

The ghosts are always quirky and not easily understood.  He writes about ordinary people in extraordinary situations.  Cady is a rare  writer who can write 'sweet' stories without being sentimental or  nostalgiac.  Sweet, hard stories?  Paradoxical, but delightful.  A must  read!	1999-06-12
