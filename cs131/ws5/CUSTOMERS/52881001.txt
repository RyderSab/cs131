How about taking exotic trips, buying expensive clothes, dinners filled with lobster and champagne all on someone else's tab? That's exactly what Trudy Bell does in the novel In Sheep's Clothing by Mary Monroe. Trudy's life has been pretty mundane living with her dad and in a 10-year relationship with her boyfriend James. After being robbed while working at her father's liquor store, Trudy quits and gets hired as a secretary for a travel agency. As the secretary, Trudy has access to the company credit card in order to pay office expenses. She decides to have a little fun and treats herself to lavish lunches and designer wardrobes at the company's expense. Since using the credit card is so easy, it's time to take it to another level and focus on her boss Ann Oliver. Ann is classy, elegant and stylish, everything Trudy wants to be. But when Ann treats her as a second-class citizen, Trudy plots the ultimate revenge and takes her identity.  But Trudy may have more than she bargained for, as becoming Ann Oliver could turn deadly.<br /><br />Mary Monroe does an incredible job of bringing this tale of identity theft to life. In Sheep's Clothing has humor and edge-of-your-seat drama. Mary Monroe always features real characters that always find themselves on the wrong side of the law and drags their friends down with them. Trudy is no different because she drags her best friend into this web of deceit as well. Monroe's characters also cross that very fine line between right and wrong, which makes her novels stand out. She consistently brings novels that are pleasurable reads. While reading this novel, you'll keep wondering if Trudy will ever get caught, and what will happen if her dad and boyfriend find out. With In Sheep's Clothing, Mary Monroe once again brings us a timely, suspenseful, and exciting story full of rich characters that she is known for.	2005-10-02

Corey \\"Cee\\" Banks has to answer this question and more in Friend or Foe, the debut novel by D.L. Moore.  Cee has been a fair and respected hustler but not necessarily feared.  When his longtime girlfriend Keisha gets killed in a robbery attempt, Cee realizes that someone is taking his kindness for weakness.  Cee is trying to find out not only who killed his girlfriend but who is trying to take him out as well. He also learns that the very friends he trusts could become his enemies.<br /><br />Friend Or Foe is a stunning debut for D.L. Moore.  The story grabs you from the very first page and won't let go. Starting the novel with a robbery and murder sets the right tone for this fast paced novel.  Friend or Foe also had some unexpected twists and revelations that will keep the reader glued to the pages. D.L. Moore's wonderful storytelling ability created a perfect mix of urban grittiness and suspense. Moore not only created a wonderful main character but the supporting characters were fascinating as well.  Cee's cousin Dreama and his sidekick Blue were great entertaining elements to the story.  Friend or Foe will hopefully be the jumpstart to a long and successful career for D.L. Moore.	2005-10-02

She wants to be the queen of Philly nightlife but she might get more than she bargains for in The Velvet Rope, the latest novel by Brenda L. Thomas.  Tiffany enlists the help from her fianc&eacute; Malik, her sister Kamille, and her friend DJ Essence.  When Tiffany finds out Kamille and Malik had an affair, she goes on a downward spiral of her own and into the clutches of two powerful, conniving men. In the mist of all this, Kamille is trying to search for her real birth parents. More drama unfolds when there might be some suspected illegal activity that could shut the new club down indefinitely. Will Tiffany be able to get her head above water before it's too late?<br /><br />Brenda Thomas has once again brought us a high-quality novel.  Thomas has the knack of creating entertaining stories and characters with healthy doses of eroticism, humor, and drama. She even brings back Sasha, the sexy protagonist of Fourplay and Threesome for a brief moment in this novel. There is also a cliffhanger type ending that could leave room for a sequel.  The Velvet Rope is a novel worth standing in any line for and certainly won't leave you with rope burn afterwards.	2005-10-02

Bernice McFadden), is about the drama-filled lives of four friends: Geneva, Crystal, Chevy, and Noah. Geneva is a single mother of a teenaged son and is living paycheck to paycheck. It doesn't help that she also still sleeps with her remarried ex-husband. Crystal is the head of a successful non-profit agency. She has a long-term relationship with her very rich boyfriend Kendrick but soon learns a very dark secret about him that will turn her world upside down. Chevy has champagne dreams on a beer budget. She spends every dime on high-end material things and is always one step away from being penniless and homeless. Chevy doesn't care because there's always a rich man she can snag to finance her lifestyle. But when she gets mixed up in some illegal activities, only her friends may be able to save her. Noah is an openly gay male in a long distance relationship. Things get a little sticky when he starts craving and sleeping with women.<br /><br />Groove is a nice change of pace for Bernice McFadden, who usually doesn't write \\"mainstream\\" fiction. Sometimes when an author decides to breakaway from their normal writing, it doesn't work out. This doesn't hold true for this novelist. Bernice McFadden shows her versatility as an author by not only being able to write thought-provoking literary works, but entertaining, spicy mainstream fiction as well.  Hopefully her readers will give her a chance to expand her horizons and Bernice won't be apprehensive about doing more novels like this in the future.	2005-10-02

But there is one catch: They have to each marry their baby daddy within six months after the reading of the will. Each sister has a complicated relationship that may lead to anything but marriage. Giovanna is a successful attorney and independent woman. She has a longtime relationship and daughter with Douglas, but she has no desire to marry him. Douglas is trying to run away from a devastating secret. Keyah's boyfriend Jag put an engagement ring on her finger years ago but doesn't want to take the next step. Fatima's rocky relationship with Dune and his own baby momma drama has her rethinking her role in his life.<br /><br />Marry Your Baby Daddy was interesting novel with a lot of twists and turns. The whole plot was different and entertaining. What made this novel stand out was that the sisters had to try to convince the men in their lives that they were worthy of marriage without letting them know about the money. Marry Your Baby Daddy also shows that sometimes people get too comfortable in relationships. Maryann Reid does a good job of depicting the struggles of the whole baby daddy scenario. Even though the outcome was a little unrealistic, Marry Your Baby Daddy was still a satisfying read.	2005-10-02

She also becomes suspicious of Wellington's sudden and extended late night  meetings as well as his inattentiveness.<br /><br />Mary B. Morrison has done it again with this novel. To be able to write a satisfying sequel is a task in itself. But her ability to write the fifth book of a seven part series and still keep it as captivating as the first truly shows that this author has a remarkable talent.  Nothing Has Ever Felt Like This has all of the drama and erotic elements of her previous novels. Morrison has characters that you'll never grow tired of. It's almost a shame that this story is such a page-turner because at the end of the book you'll want to dive right into part six of the series. In case you didn't know, the series should be read in this order: Soul Mates Dissipate, Never Again Once More, He's Just A Friend, Somebody's Gotta Be On Top, and Nothing Has Ever Felt Like This. Parts six and seven will be When Somebody Loves You Back and Our Little Secret. All of Mary B. Morrison's novels are highly recommended.y recommended.	2005-10-02

Brickhouse is the latest novel by Rita Ewing that centers on a Harlem fitness superstar named Nona Simms.  Nona has made Brickhouse one of the hottest gyms in the city.  Celebrities, politicians, and athletes all faithfully come to workout to get that \\"Brickhouse\\" physique.  But the walls of Brickhouse could be tumbling down due to corrupt city officials who want Nona's gym out and a new mall in. Nona also has to deal with her own daughter's body image issues and an unexpected love interest. It will take all of Nona's strength and willpower to fight against the demise of Brickhouse in Harlem.  Nona will fight to the end with the help of her friends.  But her friends have their own issues.  Nona's business partner Allen Wade is trying to hide a terrible secret that could spell the end of both of their futures.  Lelia is dealing with her failing marriage to a New York Knicks superstar and an affair with a politically powerful man.  Anna is still reeling from the death of her son and trying to keep her marriage to the mayor afloat.<br /><br />Rita Ewing brings forth a delightful and interesting novel.  Brickhouse uncovers a plot that a lot of businesses in the real world have to deal with, namely gentrification and big business moving into historic neighborhoods such as Harlem. Rita Ewing showed immense creativity in developing the Nona Simms character. Ewing's writing style is refreshing and proves that she can hold her own in this first (and hopefully not her last) solo effort.	2005-10-02

This Book Should Never Have Been Written	Shades of Justice is about Gwen Parrish, an attorney trying to earn a coveted judgeship.  She soon finds how difficult this is when she faces various political and personal challenges.  Unfortunately, this story moves so slow that I've had this book for 4 years and refuse to pick it up again.  It's like Gwen kept whining about this judgeship that she thought she deserved for some reason.  I didn't care about her or any of the other characters.  Linda McKeever Bullard's writing style makes this an extremely painful read.  It's no wonder that this was the only novel from this author.	2005-09-07

Note: Like another reviewer said, I had to think long and hard before reviewing this book!<br /><br />Marilyn Grimes is a 44-year-old wife and mother of three.  She has spent half of her life taking care of everyone else's needs before her own including her husband Leon and her live-in mother-in-law Arthurine. With the children out of the house, Marilyn now wants to make herself happy.  An unexpected pregnancy may change all of this in The Interruption of Everything, Terry McMillan's latest novel.  Pregnancy isn't the only drama in Marilyn's life.  Leon is going through a mid-life crisis, her own mother is starting to forget things, and her younger foster sister has two kids and is addicted to drugs.  All of this has Marilyn wanting to drop everything and run away.  But where will she run to?<br /><br />The Interruption of Everything is about how giving too much can cause you to lose yourself in the process.  Terry McMillan gives us a different perspective into African-American life.  The main character alone in this novel is a refreshing change.  Marilyn is not only a wife and mother, she's a skilled craft and jewelry maker.  So why the 3.5 rating you ask for a Terry McMillan novel?  First of all, I'm a huge Terry McMillan fan and have been waiting anxiously for this current novel.  But having said that, there were still quite a few problems with the story.  I was expecting a little more from Marilyn as a character.  I wanted her to drop everything and runaway for a few weeks or even a few days to just focus on herself for a change.  I was waiting for her to \\"jump\\" like it said in the book description but she never did.  I also felt there was a lot of moaning and groaning in the novel that makes you wonder is this what you have to look forward to in your 40s?  With those problems aside, this was still a good novel.	2005-09-07

Mookie's increasing celebrity status is putting a strain on his relationship with Pam and Fatimus is put in the middle of it all.  They find out that the L.A. life isn't all they hoped it would be.<br /><br />  A Dream Come True is a gripping coming-of-age novel that anyone could relate to.  Michael T. Owens gives you an in-depth insider guide into the hip-hop music world.  Instead of the usual numbering of chapters, Owens instead uses track listings (for example, Track One for Chapter 1, and so on).  A Dream Come True is a fast pace, entertaining novel.  There is also a valuable lesson: all that glitters isn't gold.  Michael T. Owens writing style and use of imagery is a welcome change in today's African American fiction market.  With a book as good as A Dream Come True, Owens will hopefully accomplish his own dream of becoming a bestselling novelist.	2005-09-07

D has also been hired to protect Ivy's latest project (bubble-gum pop artist Bridgette Haze) who he wants to change into a more urban image. Someone is targeting Ivy's artists and it's D's job to stop this from happening.<br /><br />  This novel has all of the elements of a good mystery but it still falls short. There is an extremely dry flow to the whole story. A mystery should have an exciting build up and end in an explosive climax. The Accidental Hunter did neither. There was nothing to draw you into the story. The novel would have been better if the focus was just on one kidnapping plot instead of two. Too many sub-plots that had nothing to do with the mystery itself killed this story. This will distract and confuse the reader because there isn't a strong main plot. Nelson George's earlier novels with the exception Nightwork were wonderful stories. He needs to refocus and return to his earlier style of fiction writing.	2005-08-06

A chance meeting in an elevator during a blackout brings these women together to devise the ultimate plan for revenge.<br /><br />  Getting Hers is an exhilarating, thrilling ride that doesn't slow down. The diversity of the main characters is what makes this novel stand out. There is enough drama and intrigue to keep the reader on their toes.

Step into Shai Clark's world in Hoodlum, the latest novel by K'wan.  Shai's father Poppa Clark has been running New York's underworld for decades but he's now ready for retirement and legitimate business. Poppa has been grooming his older son Tommy to be the next heir to the throne while making sure Shai is the \\"good\\" son. Shai goes off to college and becomes a basketball star but things turn sour as he is kicked out and sent back home. Shai now wants to prove to his father and brother that he can be a part of the infamous Clark empire but Poppa wants him to be as far away from the streets as possible.  A series of events cause Shai to question if his heart is made for the streets and to represent the Clark name or should he kiss the game goodbye?<br /><br />Hoodlum is an urban tale like no other. It reads like a modern day mob movie. There are so many elements to this novel that make it so vivid and real. From ordered hits on enemies, snitches, gun battles, drugs, to dealings with the Mafia and Asian assassins, this book has it all. You will be glued to this book to the very last page. Although the Clark family is the main characters of the book, there are some other characters in book that are just as intriguing. You meet people like Swan, Shai's best friend and street soldier, and Poppa Clark's down south running from the law nephew Gator. Usually when there are a lot of characters in a novel the story can get a little junky but that's not the case here. The writing is so descriptive that you feel that you are on the street getting an eyewitness account of the drug trade. K'wan's masterfully developed characters and plot is what makes Hoodlum such a thrilling read.	2005-07-30

Corey is trying to live the straight and narrow but the lure of the streets is more appealing. Corey eventually starts selling drugs, drops out of school and lands in prison. In prison, he meets a mentor that will teach him some important lessons. The story and the characters were very compelling. What was different about this story is that Corey didn't come from a broken home. Both parents were married and tried to steer him in the right direction, especially his dad. And despite all the people around him telling him the right things to do in life, he journeys down a path that no one could envision. This is the third book by Shannon Holmes, and arguably his best yet. His novels keep getting better and better.

By the title of the book you would think that this would be a tell-all book by a supposed womanizer, right? Wrong! This book is random experiences that the author has had with different women during his womanizing. This is nothing more than a collection of cluttered confusion. There is no chronological order for the dates and times that are listed on the pages. This is not in a memoir format but just the author's random thoughts that have no rhyme or reason. Personally, I could not get past page ten of this novel. I have a confession myself: I wish I never even picked up this book.	2005-07-14

Her mother and sister both become distant after the accident and Aria feels like she is living alone in the world. She tries to carve out a decent life for herself by teaching literacy to teenage girls and continuing to live with her newly-engaged best friend. When Aria finds out that she may be pregnant by her longtime boyfriend, she finally thinks that she will have the family that she always wanted. But there is a secret that could destroy her relationship and everything she had hoped for. Tayari Jones creates vivid characters that leap off the page. When reading The Untelling, I felt like I was walking down the same inner-city neighborhood as Aria. Jones' writing style puts you in the mind of Bernice McFadden. And with a wonderful novel like The Untelling, she's well on her way to becoming a critically-acclaimed author herself.<br /><br />-Radiah Hubbert<br /><br />Urban-Reviews.com	2005-07-14

G owns the infamous Harlem G-Spot social club and gives Juicy all the material things but no love or sexual fulfillment. G keeps Juicy under lock and key, but when G's son comes into the picture, things get interesting as Juicy has her eyes on him. On the cover of the book, Noire has a blurb by another author claiming that this was \\"Coldest Winter Ever meets Addicted.\\" This is a disservice since you won't be able to judge the book on its own merit. There weren't enough steamy erotic scenes to even compare it to Addicted. Juicy simply wasn't \\"juicy\\" enough. G-Spot is exciting and action packed but there's also some disturbing violence in this book. Because it was marketed as an urban \\"erotic\\" tale, a reader may not be prepared for this type of story line. Maybe the author's next book \\"Candy Licker\\" will deliver what the title promises. All in all, this was still a wonderful novel....a STREET FICTION novel.<br /><br />Radiah Hubbert<br />Urban-Reviews.com	2005-07-14

There's alot of drama in this book but the story and plot didn't really grab me. I only finished the book to see what would become of Terri. This is Tony Lindsay's first urban street novel.

I only purchased this book due to it being a bookclub selection. This book had a great storyline but there were a few problems with this book. I loved the Anne Marie/Febe split personality thing and the domestic violence theme also. The biggest problem I had with this was if one of  Febe/Anne's closest friends was a psychologist, why couldn't she figure out that Anne had  a split personality??? I also didn't like that one day Anne just woke up and remembered who she was and Febe just disappeared. Anne had to explain to all of her friends including the psychologist about Febe. It would have been better if this all came out in a therapy session and not just waking up one day and discover it. The whole getting back at domestic violent offenders scheme was so outrageous that it wasn't believable.<br />I understand what the author was trying to do with this book but it missed the mark.  &quot;Nervous&quot; by Zane has a much better<br />main character with a split personality.	2004-01-05

After reading an excerpt of one of the chapters, I was inclined to get my hand on a copy and read the entire book.  Harlem Redux is a historical murder mystery set in Harlem during the 1920's. David McKay comes back to Harlem to find his sister dead.  But was it suicide or not? Well, you won't get the answer from me!  You're going to have to read the book to find out for yourself!<br /><br />Persia Walker does a wonderful job of storytelling that reminds me of Bernice Mcfadden (Sugar, This Bitter Earth, Warmest December). You can tell that Walker really did her homework and research on this novel.  From the 1920's Harlem backdrop to David's civil rights activities, Harlem Redux is a book that many probably looked over because of the unfamiliar author name or (quite simply) the lack of promotion the book received.  But believe me, you need to run (not walk) to your local bookstore or order online right now and get this wonderful novel from Persia Walker...another author who's work should have gone further than it did.	2002-08-31

First of all, all the men didn't &quot;check their baggage&quot; until they got into a relationship. Curtis Bunn made it seem as if all a man needs to do is find a good woman and she will help him &quot;check his baggage&quot;. This was unrealistic. A person needs to have all of their &quot;baggage checked&quot; BEFORE they go into a relationship. I also thought that Larry becoming saved and sanctified was too sudden. If Larry's new girlfriend was so saved and sanctified then why was she wearing daisy dukes when he met her at the grocery store? Also, why did the two of them spend the weekend together in the SAME hotel room and why did she have on a Victoria's Secret silk nightgown??? Real saved people would never do anything like that.

It was a selection from my book club and everyone had a diffult time reading this. I thought that it was an interesting story but the writing was dull. I feel that Asha had alot of unresolved issues before she even met Rashid. She was not stable enough emotionally to be in a regular relationship let alone one with a prisoner. What really bothered me about this book is how she had this&quot;poor me&quot; attitude when she talks about the conjugal visits. Well, whose fault is that? She CHOOSE to marry Rashid and to be in that difficult situation. I found it appalling that Asha would try to get sympathy from the readers about a decision that she made. In end, I felt sorry for her. I hope she gets some sort of counseling.	2001-04-21

I found the book interesting BUT there were a few problems. Too many characters. The focus should have been just Aletha &amp; Desiree. There was not enough character development on Veronica(which would have been nice). I didn't like the way her boyfriend just walked out on her. Another problem was Louise. It seems that Louise was just thrown in the book without any real background on her. That whole ex-nun thing was confusing to me. If Delorys would just stick to one or two characters and develop them, then her next book will be a 5 star novel	2000-12-08

The story was so slow and boring that it took me forever to read this book. I don't understand what Omar was trying to do with this book. Borrow it from the library.	2000-12-08

I couldn't wait to read it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. This book was missing something. I found that the Tracy in this book had all the money and fame but was lonely and bitter. I mean I was expecting Tracy to at least find a man to share the rest of her life with in this book.(and I do not mean Victor) Another thing that bothered me was that Tracy went from teacher to big Hollywood star with no bumps in between. Omar also should not have mentioned himself in the book so much either. The poetry could have been excluded also. There was a part in the book where Jill Scott is mentioned but Tracy says that you know what to expect from her. Was that a dis to Jill Scott??? Anyway, St.Louis was horrible  but please get A Do Right Man. I still have faith in you Omar.	2000-12-08

I am in the broadcasting field and this book  was on point. Yes, there was alot of broadcast jargon in the book but not  so much that an average person could not understand it. I would highly  recommend this book to anyone.I think this book gave a unique behind the  scenes look at the real world of broadcast news. This is alot more  entertaining than any news show. Keep up the good work Yolanda!	2000-08-26

The thing that bothered me the most  about this book is the relationship between Verdi and Rowe.I found it  disgusting that Rowe just stepped away from his marriage to get involved  with a collge student. By the end of the book, I felt sorry for Verdi. She  never had a chance at real true love because she allowed herself to be  stuck with Rowe. She didn't even have a chance to have kids. Johnson came  back much too late in the story. I do like Diane's other novels.	2000-08-19

First of all, there was too much boring focus on Rosemary  and not nearly enough on Kennedy. I would have liked to find out more about  why Kennedy turned to a career in law enforcement and her struggle to raise  a teenaged son. I also would have liked it if Kennedy and Issac had  rekindled their relationship. The whole governor's race plot could have  been left out and maybe saved for another book. In the end, I was left with  alot of questions. Was Issac's son safe on the streets? Who was behind the  police corruption? Did Rosemary ever recover? Did she ever tell Issac the  dark family secret? There were way too many themes in this book that just  didn't gel together. One Better and Knowing were much better books. I would  suggest buying those titles and borrowing this one from the library.  Hopefully, her next one will be better.	2000-08-19
