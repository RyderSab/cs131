His description is significant: &quot;Emotional dishonesty ranges from simply hiding our true feelings from others to actively falsifying our feelings in ways that may be more acceptable and less confrontational.... We hide our true feelings from other people when those feelings aren't convenient or might be uncomfortable.&quot; This is a complex problem needing multi-faceted solutions. It is time for the realistic psychology of true human emotions to replace the superficial &quot;don't worry, be happy&quot; positive psychology movement. Many of us need to get in touch with &quot;The Positive Power of Negative Thinking&quot; (and feeling). To learn to be more real and speak up more honestly, I like Dr. Held's book &quot;Stop Smiling, Start Kvetching.&quot; In this new book, &quot;The Half-Empty Heart&quot; Alan Downs has added his thoughtful and helpful contribution to the realistic psychology movement. Excellent and important book.	2003-02-18

The pictures in Blue Day Book, by careful selection, inspiration, or luck, happen to work well for me. And the text with the photos is fine -- the photos are really the key here. To smile, chuckle, laugh seems to help break the spell of negativity -- to interrupt the downward monentum, have a chance to turn it around. So I recommend this book very highly, for oneself or as a thoughtful gift for someone you care about who is being touched by the Blues. I myself am not an optimist by nature. When the Blues don't seem to want to be shaken off in one try, then I do some journaling and reading at more depth. My current favorite for working on improving my mental attitude is The Positive Power of Negative Thinking by Dr. Norem. But sometimes a few minutes in the morning is really all it takes to stop that downward momentum -- which is why, in my blue periods, I keep the Blue Day Book on my bedside table. Maybe it should be called &quot;photo therapy&quot; -- this book is a good blues buster.	2002-12-19

I was happy yesterday to see Dr. Wilson's book included in the New York Times Magazine \\"Year in Ideas -- 2002\\" because it is a book worth reading, even if you see shortcomings in its analysis. I find the author blurs or misses an important distiction -- for example, most people can tell you fairly accuratelely their personal level of 'social interest' (low, medium, high) but they can't tell you why they have the level of social interest that they do. So they make up stories that inaccurately 'explain' their level of social interest. BUT if a person has read Alfred Adler's theory (and research confirming it) that birth order influences one's level of social interest, with middle borns averaging highest and only children and first borns averaging lowest in social interest, THEN but only then can a person make an insightful statement about one aspect of why she or he possesses a particular level of social interest. Thus, self-reports about some things are often accurate, while being inaccurate about other things. This example illustrates an overlooked theme -- studying the best psychological theory and research is another good way to understand oneself.<br />A key issue for me in the unconscious, adaptive and maladaptive, is the quest for self-insight into negative thoughts, feelings, and tendencies -- such as worry, anxiety, and pessimism. Dr. Wilson's book can be a useful adjunct here, but only if one gets a better understanding of what might be \\"adaptive\\" about the human tendency toward negativity that many of us share. The adaptive function of negativity concerns playing through worst case scenarios and avoiding unrealistic optimism so that one is prepared for things in life that do not go well. Therefore, a person inclined to negativity might be better off studying the adaptive value of that psychological strategy, explained in Dr. Norem's book The Positive Power of Negative Thinking, rather that getting the idea from Dr. Wilson that acting as if one were an optimist will help you become an optimist. This example shows that there remain many complexities as yet unresolved in personality psychology. Dr. Wilson's interpretation and application of self-perception theory is indeed interesting, but while studying it one should not forget the richness of individual differences, the subtleties of cognitive strategies, or the complexities of human nature. I recommend always probing the adaptive function of a psychological phenomenon before trying to change it toward a superficial cultural ideal or stereotype, which may not really be as adaptive or functional as it first appears. The quest for \\"why\\" is not useless, but it does require more time and effort than just contemplating \\"why\\" for a few minutes. So I recommend Dr. Wilson's new book, but only in the context of other psychological knowledge and approaches.	2002-12-16

His book is a truly inspirational classic that can be enthusiastically recommended to anyone who wants to improve her or his mental attitude and thinking style. This book is both insightful and practical. Cognitive psychology does, of course, have some new updates that can be added to Hill's classic PMA formulation. For example, the cognitive strategy or thinking style of 'constructive pessimism' is explained in Dr. Norem's book The Positive Power of Negative Thinking (PPNT) which is a recent psychology update of the Norman Vincent Peale classic about Positive Thinking. Not every strategy works equally well for every individual. Only one thing is certain -- it is a good thing to work on improving one's mental attitude and thinking style.

This represents a paradigm shift in psychological science. Evolutionary Psychology, with its appeal to stories about human instincts for male-directed sexuality and violence, ran out of intellectual life and scientific validity in the 1990s. Some people, such as fans of Dr. Pinker's Blank Slate, have not yet become aware of the death of Evolutionary Psychology. By reading \\"Liars ...\\" one can start to learn about the new (inter) discipline of Cultural Biology. Developmental sensitivity to context, and the inherent flexibility of genetic programs, are two key themes. The significance of bonobos as a species and the influence of the evolution of self-awareness and metacognition are two key things that Cultural Biology understands whereas most who identify with Evolutionary Psychology do not. So Cultural Biology is both smarter and wiser.	2002-12-14

I want to add a related point, which concerns O'Connor's other book, &quot;Active Treatment of Depression.&quot; Although that book is aimed at therapists, I would recommend it also as a follow-up for any reader who appreciated &quot;Undoing Depression.&quot; Reading his 2 books in sequence is a doubly helpful process. As psychologists become more aware of how depression is usually embedded in a broader pattern of negativity -- worry, anxiety, pessimism -- readers can benefit from those broader, related insights. For example, The Positive Power of Negative Thinking by Julie Norem updates traditional cognitive therapy with new understanding of 'constructive pessimism' as a cognitive-emotional experience. And, as other reviewers have pointed out, the cognitive therapy classic Feeling Good is still useful today. So don't miss O'Connor's 2 books, and related titles may help with the broader psychological context.	2002-12-06

I recommend these books to all who are troubled by negative thinking, worry, anxiety, and pessimism. The meditative approach to \\"not thinking\\" really helps to lessen negative thinking.

What, me worry? Yes, I do tend to worry about possible negative outcomes and events.  For me, this book improved my life because &quot;The Positive Power of Negative Thinking&quot; explains 'constructive pessimism' and how to enjoy a more adaptive and productive life in spite of normal anxiety. The personality quiz in the book helps you to understand yourself and people you know, and how best to relate to different types of people.<BR>    I do wish optimists would read this book too -- the case studies in each chapter help optimists and pessimists to understand each other better and even to appreciate each other.
