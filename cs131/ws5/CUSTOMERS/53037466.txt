And the text (what I read of it in the waiting room of the doctor's office where I discovered it!)   is a delightful, literate and fascinating compilation of memoir and history of the Paso Robles area.  I spent an hour with this book and rushed home to buy it.  My elderly mom, with me in the waiting room, is a nationally recognized painter, and she, too was very impressed with the art - and she has a tough eye, having juried shows, etc.  What a delightful find!	2005-07-12

A wise Pilates/Feldenkrais teacher introduced me to this book. Using \\"Somatics\\" I personally found relief from chronic lower lumbar pain, and got help retraining my gait and balance after a severe ankle injury.The book is simple to understand with sections for various problems.<br /><br />Somatics are a system of gentle movements -  while breathing and mildly focusing  (and sometimes simple \\"looking\\" in certain directions)- which through a combination of neuromuscular stimulation and the gentlest of stretches (no pain!)  manages to  to roll back years of stiffness, aid injury recovery, and significantly relieve some of the stresses of aging.<br /><br />Somatics is based on sound science, and Feldenkrais, yoga, and Pilates are related.  But Somatics exercises - movements really -  are even gentler, and smarter,  No equipment but a towel or mat is needed.  Any level of fitness can benefit, even someone in a wheelchair or bedridden can do some of the movements.<br /><br />If you have the patience and interest, I suggest reading the book and working through every single exercise presented, which is what I did coming back from traumatic injury.  Some will \\"speak to you\\", and you'll incorporate them later into daily practice.<br /><br />If you lack the patience or the time for this, the book is still valuable for its simple \\"CAT STRETCH\\" a five minute series of gentle movements which gently moves the whole body and  seem to me like \\"the fountain of youth\\" .  I  do the cat stretch twice a day  - on arising and before bed.<br /><br />I could not recommend this book and Somatics in general more highly.  Your back, ankles, knees, hips, shoulders, and neck will thank you!!!!  And so will your friends when you pass this book along!	2005-06-01

This lengthy book dwells more on his career and the Sturm und Drang of his inner life than with the Princess, although the glimpses we see of her - filtered through his dual screen of propriety and admiration -  reveal a very human, funny, brave, and occasionally very emotional young woman who rose to the challenge of the media onslaught with grace and style, and the occasional meltdown. <BR> I enjoyed the read, did not find it salacious or titillating, and like other reviewers here, wonder what all the fuss is about.  I don't think she'd be angry if she read this book.  But neither will most readers be riveted.  Diana fans will rush out to buy blue black Quink ink and try a couple of new perfumes.  Not much other detail is offered, however.	2003-11-02

Shattuck's writing has it all -  pacing, a smart, vulnerable/tough heroine, an interesting set of sidekicks (the perfect butler- female, and a stuntwoman who literally takes a bullet for her friend) and a very sexy male lead who retains a sense of mystery until the very end.    Rather than an embellished romance novel, I found this to be a suprising treat - almost a perfect female inversion of the hard boiled all-male thriller. Great fun!  Looking forward to the next in the series.	2003-09-29

Her experience as a writer and teacher, and even more importantly, her basic humanity shines through this crisp,easy to read slim volume that gives both practical advice (write 1000 words a day!)  and a wise philosophical slant on what it really takes to be a writer.  A unique combo from a woman who is as natural a teacher as she is a writer.  <br />I've been a pro in the writing biz for over twenty years, and still found amazing bits of stimulating advice - as if from an older, wiser sister, ahead of me on the road, and oh, so smart.  <br />This book works equally well for the novice looking for some tips on shaping a writing life, and for the more experienced writer who may long for a role model for facing some of life's toughest arrows.  She delivers on all counts.  Highly, highly recommended.	2003-01-06

Evanovich's humor and moment by moment inventiveness don't fail in this eighth book in the series, which I highly recommend for a fun summer read.  Stacking it up to the rest, it's not my favorite, as there are some odd loose ends here - a rival bounty hunter babe in a leather catsuit, for example, who is never explored or paid off.  However it's worth the read just to see Stephanie and the mysterious Ranger finally get it on.  It's not five stars for literary merit, or even the best of her series,but even Evanovich at her less-than-best is way, way better than most.  Guaranteed fun!	2002-07-03

I've probably read all or nearly all the books on Diana.  Somehow I'd missed this one until a friend gave it to me as a gift.  While I didn't give it 5 stars for its great literary qualities, I thought that for Diana fans, it  delightfully delivered the goods -  it is a pleasing intimate portrait with plenty of detail (food, clothes, toiletries, habits) yet with a real sense of affection, humor and respect.  <BR> <BR>Setting this apart from most Diana books is the uniquely likeable voice of the narrator.    Delorm is a class act, a man who respected and liked his boss, Dodi Fayed, and who seems to view everyone from his wealthy employer to his fellow cooks, butlers and masseuses with generosity of spirit and an open mind.  This is a refreshing contrast with the self serving busybody tone of Patrick Jephson's Diana book, or any of the royal &quot;experts&quot; who simultaneously envy, fawn and snipe.<br />The author's joie de vivre and eye for detail turn this book into a lovely little vacation on a yacht, along with two people we might have enjoyed knowing very much.   And unlike many books published after their deaths, it does not lay on the pathos, but instead is more of a celebration.  <br />All in all, this is an intimate book you can enjoy without feeling like a voyeur, and a very welcome read for anyone who misses Diana.  She sounds like a lot of fun.  <br />A great escape read in these glamour-free times.  Highly recommended.	2002-05-31

Not only is this a perfectly constructed thriller, but it's told from the point of view of a very, very unusual person - Silent Joe is a facially scarred (a relative threw acid on him as an infant) 24 year old bodyguard/cop, the adopted son of a warm hearted but flawed Orange County politico, who is murdered almost immediately. <br />We follow Silent Joe on his quest for the who and why of this killing - and as we take this journey, both the man and his murdered father become clear to us.  Joe  is almost autistic in his perceptions and language, laconic to the point of bizarreness, and oddly talented - with an eidetic memory for conversation, time and detail, and an uncanny mastery of all the defensive arts.  <br />Neither inflated in his self perception, nor blind to his father's foibles,  this relentless, non judgemental stranger in a strange land uncovers and digests  layer after layer of interlocking blackmail and crime (we slowly discover, along with Joe, that the murdered man was some cross between a Machiavellian monstrosity and a Robin Hood) . What is so fascinating is that we travel through many shades of gray in the political and criminal underworlds of Orange County, but through the very very simple lens of a simple man's eye.<br />It is actuallly delightful being in this character's shoes and there is something essentially clear in Joe's vision of right and wrong, truth and lies, good and evil, that is at  the very heart of why I enjoy mysteries. In this way, Joe reminded me somewhat of Thomas Harris' wonderful creation of  Clarice Starling in Silence of the Lambs.   Unlike Clarice in most  ways, Joe's  extraordinarily sane (if unusual) presence is a terrific vantage point for the wild ride of the story.<br />I enjoyed this thriller for its unique and deeply loveable hero, intelligent writing, strong narrative drive, and fascinating characters.  A great, great read.	2002-04-13

Lisa Scottoline has done it again - crafted an immensely satisfying legal thriller with a strong heroine - this time Mary DiNunzio's cohort -  Judy Carrier, a woman with &quot;crayon yellow&quot; hair,  a golden retriever puppy, and more balls than the macho Italian killers she finds herself pitted against.  This book has all the blockbuster elements - action, suspense, romance, legal surprises, and smart dialogue - effortlessly combined into an entertaining read that kept me awake nights. I especially loved her tough, smart heroine who nevertheless made very human, and sometimes very feminine decisions at surprising times.   Lisa Scottoline takes you on a very fun ride with this one.

One day my husband brought this cookbook home as a gift and it literally changed the way I cook.  I began with two recipes, one &quot;un buon spaghetatta&quot; and the other a white bean soup.  The recipes are so explicit that even a novice cook will have success, yet they are written in a friendly, smart style that neither condescends nor leaves anything out.   If you have ever traveled to Italy, you will recognize the results as so authentically Italian tasting that you will be astounded.  I now think differently about many things (garlic - less is more) and balsamic vinegar (used to add a subtle punch to pasta dishes!)... and I love the flavors and textures this book has brought to our meals.

It is wonderful fodder for the imagination of art teachers, set decorators, designers, artists in a variety of media, and crafters looking to add spice and variety to their creations.

Some are about becoming &quot;pro&quot; - dealing with editors, managing your PR.  This is not about that.  WILD MIND is about practicing the art of writing and about the life of one writer, Natalie Goldberg.  But is so clearly instructive, so vividly stimulating, that reading it will automatically boost your own creative fires, and very likely your output.  So...in its way, it is a surprisingly practical book.   <br />Like her earlier WRITING DOWN THE BONES, Goldberg has created another wonderful resource for the writer at any stage of his/her craft.  She's evolved, refined and developed the exercises presented in Bones, as well as added new ideas.  A favorite of mine is to read work aloud often.  She writes: &quot;Write, read,write, read.  You become less attached to whether it is good or bad. 'I wrote this now I'll read it, no big deal.' &quot;  She gives guidelines for working in a writer's group, and has many &quot;try this&quot; suggestions sandwiched in between anecdotal moments from her life which enrich and strengthen us.<br />As a professional writer for 25 years, I personally learned from this book mid career and continue to revisit eleven years later.   A must have for any writer.	2001-04-29

I've been a professional writer in film, tv, theater and print for over 25 years and Natalie Goldberg's book still has a place of honor on my resource bookshelf.  I find myself returning to this book again and again (most recently last month!) to dip into her unique combination of practical  and creative advice - and a fabulous bag of  tricks to jumpstart stalled writing, improve quality, boost output, and live a sane life while getting those words on the page.  <br />I was fortunate enough to attend a workshop with her in Taos some years ago, and a project I was stalled on was kicked into life by her wise and challenging exercises. But  I can't go to Taos everytime I need a dose of Natalie.  Fortunately, just this book can do it for me....   Goldberg is smart, funny, wise, and simply a genius at teaching writing.  I could not recommend this book more highly - and to all writers - young or old, new or returning, stalled, or unsure, or anyone who just wants to be better and go deeper.    Don't hesitate.

I'll admit I'm on a Sherlock Holmes kick, and what a delight it was to discover the  writing of John Hall who effortlessly seems to mimic Conan Doyle while spinning a credibly Holmesian tale.  Clearly an expert in the period, Hall writes with an ease and wit (I laughed out loud)  truly reminiscent of the creator of Holmes and Watson - not a moment rings false in this quick-paced story of  Holmes' efforts to clear his old friend Lestrade's name from a long past police fiasco, and to finally bring the truth of a horrible crime to light. Only drawback for me was that I personally prefer a bit more personal involvement of Holmes, but this was a real winner, and I can't wait to read the rest (this is apparently Hall's fourth Holmes pastiche.)

The writer is talented, with a fabulous hand at scene-setting description, inventive with historical nuance and motives, and has a pretty good feel for the famous duo's personalities and voices.  But the down side is that he is decidedly poor at writing action and maintaining the plot momentum that the master craftsman Doyle made seem effortless.<br />At 398 pages (should be 100 less)  Stefanie bookends the Holmes adventure  with short, Michener-like chapters about a prehistoric burial.    Years later, an archeologist is murdered, execution-style, while digging up this burial site.  Holmes and Watson travel to the nearby village of Little Stoke to investigate.  &quot;The Charters&quot; of the title refer to some missing ancient documents that would, if found, settle a three-hundred-year-old land dispute between two local gentry.<br />These two plot threads never quite blend, and the pacing and mystery structure suffers in the middle of the book, finally picking up with an underground adventure in a crypt, and a second murder.  Holmes and Watson ring true, but as the book progresses, Watson's  authentic sounding &quot;voice&quot; deteriorates slightly (at one point he calls Holmes &quot;Sherlock&quot;), and  Holmes begins to pontificate and pose a bit too much.<br />On the plus side, the novel does succeed in transporting you on a long, slow journey back to the gaslit era, and if you are relaxed and not expecting major thrills, you will enjoy the ride...  I will certainly seek out this author's next Holmes book and hope that he will continue to work from his many strengths - and aim next for the true Doyle economy of style.	2001-02-17

This was a fun read, and the author has a strong descriptive style and energetic pacing which transports you  (along with Holmes and Watson)   to various Victorian locales including the  Paris sewers and a Mary-Poppin-like flight through London's night skies... and the villain and plotline are imaginative.  But too many liberties (see other reviews) are taken with the Holmes/Watson relationship, dialogue, and personalities to satisfy the real Conan Doyle fan.

How can a simple 20 minute break (two or three times a day) profoundly affect creativity, productiveness, body fat storage, and  problem solving?<br />A long time ago I read somewhere that the British army once made record time over some incredible journey on foot by the simple trick of resting many short times each day.  I've often pondered how to apply this to my own marathon workaholic style and this book is the answer I sought.  Attention workaholics - this book is for you.<br />What absolutely free and painless thing can we do to work smarter, think better, boost creativity, and lose weight?  The answer (and the scientific evidence) is right here.    My guess is that techniques described here will massively boost productivity - and health!   But my fear is that this man and his theories are ahead of his time.  And his lackluster writing style will fail to start the revolution to this &quot;tortoise&quot; style of winning life's race to achievement and health.<br />Highly recommended for content, this book's only flaws are style and organization (surprising from  publisher Jeremy Tarcher).

Val Andrews, a magician and photographer who has turned to writing has written a number of Holmes pastiches.  This is the first I've read, and while disappointed, I'll give his work another try.  This story finds Holmes pulling out of a depression and becoming involved in a long dormant  murder of a young woman at a seaside resort, by way of his old acquaintance Irene Adler.  Andrews hits on all the Holmesian cliches (Holmes' disguises fooling Watson, the arrogant local policeman, etc.) but doesn't fool the reader as Doyle so cleverly did with the mystery elements.  As someone skilled in slight of hand in real life, perhaps Andrews will grow more skilled at making us look at the wrong suspect more convincingly in his next works.  A good editor might help this writer to perfect Watson's unique narrative voice which here sounds right only part of the time.  A pleasant read for an uncritical Holmes fan.	2001-01-16

As a huge Holmes fan, and great admirer of Doyle, I am always looking for a pastiche that will transport me into the world of Holmes and Watson.  While Millet has suceeded in conveying the right tone and pacing (both usually missed by Doyle imitators) he disappoints slightly in the lack of what one might call &quot;character juice&quot; - and simply puts the Holmes and Watson we know so well through their very familiar paces as Holmes tries to prevent an arsonist from destroying a railroad and many people in a remote Minnesota town.  Besides adding nothing new to the character lore, Millet disappoints with his villain and secondary characters, and misses a real chance to play up cultural differences by placing a couple of London Victorian dandies in the Wild West.

In skillful cozy style, this author blends the supernatural (the wise and witty Dimity is dead but communicates to Lori via a blue notebook) with a crisp mystery in which Lori unravels the identity of a strange but oddly appealing tramp who is found, near death, in her front yard - a trail which leads back to WWII aviation heroes, and a wealthy London socialite. We all love mysteries for the order they restore to our world,and this is no disappointment- a funny and fun read, and comforting at the holidays.  Recommended highly!	2000-12-19

I found it pleasant, but uninspired- one scene has her serving tuna sandwiches and tomato soup to her family, which kind of sums up the diet we're offered - lacking in imaginative ddetail, witty dialogue,  or unususal characters - everyone and every conversation is mundane to the extreme, yet is oddly comforting in its familiarity.	2000-12-18

His scornful opinions of his former boss repeat endlessly in this overwrought, judgemental book - despite the fact Diana is shown as faultlessly punctual, dependable for star quality, truly compassionate, always perfectly groomed, and with a wicked sense of humor, she is faulted for any number of things from eating a Cadbury's fruit and nut bar between appearances (evidence of bulimia, for Jephson) and for having &quot;mixed motives&quot; in her charity work.  <br />Jephson states early on that he scorns those who keep journals, and his own lack of notes make this stream of conciousness writing very short on facts and anecdotes, and full, instead, of an uninteresting man's self examination.  Princess Diana supporters and detractors alike will find little to learn or ponder.  Simply a waste of time for all.	2000-10-19

I won't belabor that all the &quot;heroes&quot; of Void Moon are theives or worse, what's terrific is that Connelly has made them likeable, fascinating, and complex.  There's nothing to fault  -the pacing, action,  high tech details, compelling ambience, and great characters make for a  slick, terrifically fun read.  No redeeming morality here, but masterful  plotting that's hard to put down.	2000-04-26

The double plot keeps momentum peaked, and this Spenser novel thankfully lacks the bitterness that crept into the middle of this long and  successful series. Parker's crisp, spare style looks deceptively easy but  is the mark of a master of the genre. Highly recommended.	2000-04-18

Yes, it's too long; and the lack of an index is frustrating.  But Dement presents ideas here that need to be heard, and haven't before.  Sleep is not a simple process that can be distilled into a soundbyte - and his  scientist's training won't let him devolve this into a mere list of  &quot;tips to sleep better&quot;.  So, it it worth wading through 450  pages?  A resounding yes.  My own sleep problems were helped the very night  I skipped ahead to the sleep hygeine chapter (the closest things to tips in  the book).  My understanding of jetlag and &quot;prime time&quot; for  creative work will help me in the future.  My respect for sleep has grown  and will change my decisions.  My realization of how close I have been to  falling asleep at the wheel is terrifyingly clear.  I am sending the book  to one friend who I am sure suffers from a life threatening sleep lack.   And unlike the reader who found Dement's career history self serving, I  hear instead a plea for more research on this vitally important subject.   Fascinating, readable, likeable, surprising, and worth every minute of your  time to read.  Although the writer's style is easy and readable, it alone  would not rate five stars.  But the content is five star plus.  Buy it!	2000-03-22
US	53037466	R1KGYAFDZ2C2RU	1557834067	311632405	The Big Picture	Books	3	17	18	N	Y	Ouch! This collection needs an editor!	As a 25yr vet of Hollywood, I'm often asked for advice by neophyte writers.  I always direct them to two things: William Goldman's ADVENTURES IN THE SCREEN TRADE, and any and all of his screenplays. The man is a genius at screenwriting, and ADVENTURES is witty, brilliant, and dead-on  about Hollywood. True to form, this new book contains nuggets of sheer  brilliance and some great entertainment. But the unedited (apparently)  collection of articles is repetitive, and begins to read as a rant.  How  many quotes from addlebrained movie execs does it take for us to realize  that they can't have an opinion without hedging? How many times must we  hear that Mr. Goldman would like the Oscar voting scores revealed and why?  I wish he or an editor had spent the time to shape this book into what Mr.  Goldman's terrific ideas warrant. He's a much better writer than the sum of  this book.  Buy this one to read by the pool, but buy his others to laugh  and learn from a master.	2000-02-04

Only problem is similar to the latest Spenser novels; the villains are awfully damned dumb.  I'm eager to read more of Jesse, but against more interesting villains.	1998-06-05

Love, joy, rage, friendship, pain, passion, subterfuge, loyalty, tragedy, and heroics ...invisible to us, and in every tree!  This astonishing and readable book is a jolt - the high speed lives of birds are more complex, fascinating, and human than we thought.   A terrific lay science book which will hook even non-bird lovers.  Despite some repetition of the author's soap box views on ecology, this book sustains interest with  a mix of terrific anecdotes, science and philosophy.  Highly recommended.	1998-04-15

Her brilliant observations are  wasted here in confetti like bursts about random characters who pop up  and never appear again. The novel lacks plot structure and anyone with  whom to identify - except perhaps for the reverently described but  unidimensional female police chief, Hammer - and she is not really  involved in solving the main mystery - a series of murders which is set  up in the beginning - and then abandoned for pages and pages of  wanderings. I kept with it, hoping for a miracle.  Wish I hadn't. Bring  back Scarpetta - and a plot - please!	1998-01-31
