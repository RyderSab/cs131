I, like all other 4 and 5 year olds, loved the show and had Sesame Street books, lunchboxes, and other merchandise.  But this book I will always remember as being the most creative and safely suspenseful book for a young child.  My mother would always read this book to my brother and I before going to bed and all three of us delighted in Grover and his precocious antics of being so scared of the monster that was awaiting him and us, the reader, at the end.  And the book never got old, my mom read the story to us millions of time and it was still just as creative, fun, fresh, and a bit scary each time.  I highly recommend this book to any parent with young children.	2004-09-08

If more students bought and used this book, their math score would improve dramatically and the SAT prep teachers would be out of business. Would I rather spend 225 dollars on a course for improving my score or 15 dollars for a book to do the same. I chose the book and boy did it work. I bought this book and used it for about 2 months prior to my second SAT. I knew I should have spent longer time with it, because I wasnt able to get all the way through this in-depth book. Yet I improved my math score by 105 points just by using this book only half of the way through. Imagine if I had the time to read the whole book! I am really impressed with Barron's. I strongly urge this for anyone who is looking to improve their SAT math skills....Oh and when I took the actual SAT I recognized about 90% of the math problems from the Barron's book. So yes it does help tremendously.	2002-01-05

It is very complex and full of interpretation. Nothing worse than getting your first tarot deck and then having to buy a book written by some &quot;tarot expert&quot; so they can tell you the meanings of every card. Unfortunately Tarot doesnt work that way. What I love the most about this book is it teaches you how to interpret each card by allowing your innate intuitive abilities to come forth and to tell you what the cards mean. The book has you work through each card in the Major and Minor Arcana one by one and allows you to paint your own portrait of what is going on in the card and what it translates to in someone's lives. There is nothing &quot;idiotic&quot; about this book. If you have always wanted to &quot;custom-make&quot; your own tarot readings and meanings, this is the book for you.	2001-07-31

Butterfly: With an Afterword by the Playwright	Books	4	11	16	N	N	Knots Landing Meets San Francisco Gay Scene	I had to read M Butterfly for my College Sophomore-level English class last semester. I admit: I cheated. I rented the movie version of M Butterfly with Jeremy Irons in it. I was shocked when I saw the movie. I had no concept of the plot. An American Man in China, a Diplomat/Spy during the Vietnam war era meets this Chinese Woman and he is smitten by her because he believes in the stereotype that all Chinese women are submissive and docile. She plays into it and they become lovers for a very long period of years. At the end he finds out that his Chinese lover is actually a man, something he claims he never knew. I watched the movie and said &quot;yeah right, look at her, how can you not tell she is a man?&quot; I was intrigued by the plot after the movie, so I read the play and I was completely engrossed. The play is so much more better than the movie. The play has a lot more characters and gives more depth. I felt sorry for the movie version of Gallimard because it seemed like he was duped, but in the play we find Gallimard to be quite sexist, cold, and down right mean. The play M Butterfly is a fine play. It blends homosexuality, male dominance, female submission, gender roles, racial roles all into one ball of plot.	2001-07-31

Whether you need a Spread to figure out the energies for the Day or a Spread about your Love Life or Career, the book has it for you! It has 1 card spread, and 23 card spreads, all that you will ever ask for. The best part of the book is it has an indepth explanation for every card in the Tarot, both the Major and the Minor Arcana.

One on hand it is excellent for giving down-to-earth, easy to understand Feng Shui principles. On the other hand, it fails to mention many important aspects about Feng Shui itself, such as the Elements. The book talks about what to do when the energy for a certain room is negative because of certain placements like the kitchen or the bathroom. But it fails to talk about the elements of each room and how to balance them. In fact the book recommends bamboo for nearly every &quot;treatment&quot;, but that is really impractical because it doesn't even explain the elements. The elements of water is briefly discusses, but the others: fire, air, metal, and wood arent even mentioned. I was very discouraged when I read the book and found this out.

Sigh...never fails, people will believe anything...especially when it comes to diets. And now that every celebrity in the world is becoming a walking waif (or is it a walking corpse) because of the Atkins diet, it really is becoming a &quot;hit&quot;...there are 2 sides pro-atkins and pro-health...The Atkins diet starts off with the assumption that carbohydrates are evil...which is beguiling to me because the first people (and Im not talking adam and eve) had a carbohydrate diet because they were food foragers....Western Culture is attacking everything it can about diet...except for the right answer. There are diets saying that carbs are bad, sugar is bad, fat is bad, protein is bad, carrots are bad...its preposterous. <br />   What is bad? Not having a well-balanced meal and not having a healthy lifestyle. Meaning having a exercise regime that focuses on muscle toning and aerobics, drinking 8 glasses of water a day, not drinking or smoking, and avoiding stress...ohh and having faith in whatever religion you believe is a big factor as well.<br />       The Atkins diet claims that carbohydrates are the cause for hunger, which will then cause you to overeat and  thus gain weight. So by that logic, if you eliminate carbs and increase protein and fat intake to satisfy hunger instead, your body will thank you for it by losin weight without food cravings. What is the diet? Thick fat steaks with slabs of melting butter, crisp bacon, eggs, thick cream, mayonnaise-based salad dressings, fried pork rinds and, rich desserts like cheesecake and mocha pie. And were supposed to believe that this diet is safe because we lose weight from it...Anorexics lose weight from starvation and bulimics lose weight from vomiting, but is that safe? No and neither is Atkins. Eating as much protein and fat as you want is unsafe and unhealthy. Why has Atkins not be labeled as unsafe? Well for one, it has...but since Atkins is &quot;new&quot; meaning it has just started to become a fad within thelast 5 years...the long-term results are unknown...but use your brain...high fat and high-protein and low-fiber diets have been linked to heart disease and cancer...but because you will be skinny when you die of colon cancer, thats supposed to be okay?<br />   Atkins makes the erroneous claims that ketosis is the key: Without incoming carbs, your body first burns its carbohydrate stores, and then the protein in its lean muscle tissue for energy, both of which release a lot of water. Your body also starts burning some fat in an inefficient way that creates toxic by-products called ketones. These build up in your bloodstream and need to be processed through your kidneys to be eliminated....this is scary. The major lab diagnostic for discovering anorexia is that ketosis is present...when we starve ourselves, ketones are then in our blood and our urine. Atkins diet is an anorexic diet except minus not eating. Look at all the people on the Atkins diet...they have no muscle mass...even Jennifer Aniston pre-Atkins had muscles...post-Atkins she is just bone. When one starves themself...the first thing that is depleted is our muscle...People thinking they are losing weight...they are!  But they arent losing fat as much as they are losing little fat and all their muscle. Too many ketones in your body can cause dizziness, headaches, mental confusion, nausea, fatigue, sleep problems and bad breath. Also, high protein intake causes your body to lose calcium, so add weakening bones to the list...So while Jenn Anison looks slim now, when she turns 50 she will have osterporosis among other things. Your brain and body are designed to get energy from carbohydrates, anything else would be abnormal food, especially ketones. Ketosis, as I said before, is a sign that your body is going into starvation mode. When your body thinks it's starving, it slows down the metabolism rate in order to conserve its fuel and will eats at its own muscle tissue to get at the carbs stored there as glycogen. The worse part, after you quit the diet, your body fights to turn every bit of food you eat into fat because it doesn't know when you're going to starve yourself again and it needs to build up a bigger reserve than you had before. You gain more fat than you had when you started.<br />   If you lose weight, you'll gain it all back - and more - once you stop the diet. If you dont plan on quitting then don't expect to have healthy kidneys for the long term: Over time, the stress of processing so many ketones can damage your kidneys, causing ketoacidosis or toxic ammonia in your blood. <br />   Be smart...go see a Registered Nutritionist, not some &quot;doctor&quot; in a book.	2000-10-08

Books	1	20	94	N	N	Go ahead, Lose Water,	Another gimmic fat diet that makes erronerous claims. Protein power's gist: If you reduce your intake of carbs to make room for more protein and fat, your body will be tricked into burning fat without feelings of hunger. The diet advocates heavy on high-fat meat, low on carbs. In fact, you have to eliminate high-carb foods such as potatoes, breads, pasta and some fruits and vegetables, to make room for the fat and protein you're supposed to eat. Similar to Atkins, PP relies on ketosis (starvation mode in your body) to help you shed pounds: Without enough carbs, your body will begin to burn its carbohydrate stores, then the protein in its lean muscle tissue for energy - both of which release a lot of water weight. Your body also starts burning some fat, just not as efficiently as exercise would, which then creates toxic by-products called ketones that build up in your bloodstream and need to be processed through your kidneys to be eliminated. Just like in the Atkins diet, this one will cause kidney damage in long-term use.<br />  There is no real weight loss because you're losing water, so you gain it back quickly once you go off the diet. If you don't exercise, the weight gain will be all fat; you won't recover any of the muscle you lost. This diet can also do damage with your health. Such as diarrhea, fatigue, sleep problems, dizziness, kidney damage or failure, weakening bones from protein blocking calcium absorption, and kidney stones.	2000-10-08

Because for one thing...teachers know...real teachers, college professors know when you are plagarizing and when its your own idea. The whole idea of Cliff Notes is for the student to be lazy, not think, and to steal another person's idea. Oh yeah, thats exactly what we want to teach our children. Not only that, if you are lazy enough to use cliff notes, then it will be only that much more obvious to your teacher because they will receive answers from you that you never could answer before. Ok I will admit, when I was a freshman in high school I used Cliff NOtes only because I had a teacher who was a moron. However I didnt get so &quot;lucky&quot; after that. I had english teachers who knew the CLiff Notes and could bust students easily...and now that I am in College I am thankful that I do not rely on Cliff Notes. For one thing, Kate Chopin is one of the best American writers and by not experiencing the depth and the beauty of her stories is just a tragedy.

Ruth is a Christian and incorporates spirituality into many traditional tenets of Christianity. So for those who were brought up in the Roman-Catholic/Christian religion, and you find comfort in that, Ruth is the spiritual writer for you.    Her books are usually very well written and very informative. Threshold is no exception. And yet, I gave the book only 3 stars. How come? Well I myself am still very divided over the subject of &quot;walk-ins.&quot; Supposedly a &quot;walk-in&quot; occurs when a spirit exits its body and makes a pact with another spirit to enter and thus live their life...So the 'body' never really fully understands the change that happens, but it usually &quot;feels different&quot;. I do not buy into that definition of walk-in that Ruth subscribes to. So the book definately left me with a &quot;I dont think so Ruthie&quot; opinion.

However I look for a more spiritual approach, such as Love your  neighbor as you love yourself and do unto others as you would have them do  unto you. The only way to live life, I say. If we put these expectations  that not only must we be perfect, but now its expected and there is a book  out there detailing it, then the rates for OCD, ADHD, various eating  disorders, and multiple personalities are going to increase. It is OK to be  human. Making &quot;mistakes&quot; is what perfection means. This  book...means making a big mistake, unfortunately not making perfection.	2000-08-19

This book answers that question and elaborately  discusses every acute angle about angels the Bible discusses. Definately a  must have for every christian wanting to see what the Word says about  angels.	2000-08-16

Ok first we have George W Bush trying to become president and now this!  I need oxygen, this is just too much stress for my poor heart. Let me see  if I get this right...the book has detailed (fine ones at that) sermons on  Gods Gifts to each of us...and this was written in the original intent that  preachers and pastors would use this sermon...the ironies of it all.     Forgive me if I am wrong but I thought that pastors spoke with the leading  of the Holy Spirit...does not Jesus say not to worry about what to say  because the Spirit will talk through you. Therefore it is silly to have a  book about pre-written sermons. That is like borrowing the Smiths answering  machine to use at the Martin's home. And the kicker...the sermons are all  about Gods Gifts....apparently if a preacher buys this book, he doesnt have  the gift to teach!	2000-08-16

This book displays the  humor and the comedy in the bible in a lovely way. SO many people say 'the  bible is SO boring, but this book allows you to see the fun stories, the  laughter, they humor and then take that and add it to the original verses.  Result: You will get more people interested in hearing about all the bible  characters and stories. Definately a good book.	2000-08-16

It worked. No this isnt slap-stick humor that I was laughing at but sheer  ignorance. This is a &quot;christian&quot; book to inform the 'christians'  to not give into demonism and not to believe this psychic 'stuff' because  its just Satan....PLease. Tis funny that Jesus was a master psychic and he  said &quot;all thing I do, you can do and more&quot; yet the church never  listens to Jesus only when it is convienent for them. This book declares  that all psychics are fruit-cakes like Latoya Jackson who want to scam you  out of their money...yet I do not see them making any of these claims to  their insurance companies. Hmmm? Bottom line: I think Jerry Falwell and Pat  Robertson wrote this book under pen names.	2000-08-12

Never ceases to  amaze me how certain new age flim flamers decide to make science prove  certain things such as auras...science cant even prove relativity how could  it prove auras? Im not saying Auras dont exist...Im just saying they cant  be captured by a camera lens. Give me a break, anyone who has ever studied  photography will know the lens is not some 4th-5th dimensional viewing that  sees into the spiritual realm...if that was the case each picture we took  would be full of guides and angels and devas and auras of trees and  people....yet you go to these &quot;aura camera&quot; and they put you in a  lower lit area...almost with a black tint or shade and they take you  picture and out comes you with an aura...Con job and that pretty much sums  the content of this book. Dont bother buying it unless you are masochistic.	2000-08-11

After all who does not want to see if anyone they know has the hand of a criminal!  So I read  it...and then i tossed it in the recycling bin. Now dont get me wrong I am  very much into esoteric subjects. However I am also into what is known as  intelligence and logic. Yes esoterics and logics can go hand in hand....the  trick is not to go overboard in esoteric (think Shirley McClaine) and not  to go overboard in logic (think egghead). Moderation, a balance is what is  needed.  So every book I read follows the key of balance. This book failed.  Now we cannot abandon DNA, because DNA and genetics plays a huge role in  our physical embodiment. To say that you can tell a criminal by their hand  shape and the way their thumb looks is intriguing...but soon turns to  ridiculous when you have taken any biology course. Look at your family and  compare your hands...if one of you has a certain nail shape...chances are  other family members if not all will have similar hands...thats called  genetic. So I am VERY wary of those that claim the physical body tells us  more then we realize. If you want an excellent book on palmistry, dont  waste your money on this one. Buy the Complete Idiots Guide to Palmistry.	2000-08-11

I am also a very  spiritual person and I know all about the releasing of the situation. I  released the situation, I released all the negativity surrounding the  causation of my pain and injury. My pain did not go away...it has steadily  increased. Dont get me wrong I believe the power of the mind is potent  however it is not a cure-all. Most of the time the person is a push-over  and very gullible, so when they 'cure' themself, well they never head the  pain to begin with, or at least not as much as they deluded themself. This  book is just another slap in the face for anybody suffering from chronic  pain. It is our fault we are in pain. We must like it, we must have  something wrong in our minds. Thats the message of this book. I cant tell  you how many self-righteous doctors are out there who say that chronic pain  is not real...but it is. When your body is in pain, it is very real  especially when you are crying in agony for 5 hours straight and people  think &quot;get over it&quot; This book only gives more pain then its  worth.	2000-08-11

It was interesting and only made me want to read more and more and more. However out of all the special &quot;bibles&quot; , this one reminds me of Sunday Mass. Perhaps because it  has a lot, dare I say majority, of catholic &quot;inspired&quot; texts. The  first stories in this book are the infancy and birth of the &quot;Virgin  Mary&quot;. In this story it was supposedly written by James the brother of  Jesus. However throughout the gospel they refer to her as &quot;our  lady&quot; which dampered my quest for truths. Further on into the infancy  narratives, they had much of the same: baby jesus a day old and talking or  people coming in egypt to worship &quot;Our Divine and Benevolent  Mother&quot; It became sickening after awhile and I had to put it down. I  did not pick the book up again for a couple weeks. Much to my dismay there  was more catholic tales. It wasnt until the latter portion of the book  where it got interesting as they had some Jewish inspired texts. The moral  of the story: great book to get you interested in this subject. However if  you are looking for depth and variety of sources, check elsewhere. This is  like a &quot;beginners&quot; book.	2000-07-01
US	50834055	R2DQ64GLE5ETJ8	1561707228	211610945	God, Creation, and Tools for Life (Journey of the Soul Series: Book 1)	Books	5	28	32	N	N	Beyond 5 stars!	I am seeing a pattern with Sylvia and Francine, as each book gets published, the book itself gets more and more better. I was hooked with Adventures of a Psychic and bought all I could find on Sylvia Browne. When  I read To The Other Side and Back, i cant tell you how my soul lept! It was  the confirmation of the God and the Home that I always knew inside me and  finally someone put that esoteric feeling into a written word. However I  didnt think she could do it again, honestly. By the end of the first  chapter of this book, God Creation, and Tools For Life, I cried tears of  rejuvination and also tears of comfort. This book reinforced the majority  of my beliefs about the Other Side and it is written in a clever dialogue  format instead of the typical paragraph style. This book allows you to meet  Francine and Sylvia as 2 seperate entities instead of the usual singular  entity in her previous works. Many people might object to what Sylvia says,  but before I knew about Ms Browne I always called myself a truth seeker and  little did I know thats exactly what Francine calls those who seek  knowledge ie &quot;gnostic&quot;. Of course I didnt agree with it all,  there were sections I knew werent completely &quot;right&quot; However I do  know that none of us are perfect, if we were we wouldnt be on earth and  that sylvia wrote to the best of her knowledge. All of us are on  individualized spiritual growth &quot;tracts&quot;, some are higher some  are lower, thats all. I highly recommend this to all people who want an  open view about the place I call Home and to the God that really exists not  the religious cold patriarchal god.	2000-07-01
