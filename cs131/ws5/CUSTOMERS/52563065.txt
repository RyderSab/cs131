Similar to Jason Fforde's Tuesday Next series, but only similar.  I found myself throughout the book trying to see if I could still recite the nursery rhyme relevant to the nursery rhyme characters that appear in the book.  I must admit I was only partly successful, :), but it was a fun aside.   <br /> <br />And that sort of escape from the book was necessary to the bizarre writing style.  It took a while to get used to.  Once I got used the convoluted, conversational (if you're suffering from a psychosis) tone of the narration, it was kind of funny.  Unfortunately, the author repeats the same jokes over and over and over (\\"It's a fact well known by those who know it well\\" appeared at least once per chapter if not more).  By about 2/3 through the book I just wanted it to end.  The storyline was innovative and engaging enough that I wanted to know who it ended, but I didn't want to have to sort through any more rambling conversations between Jack and Eddie the Bear.   <br /> <br />I'm not sure whether I'd recommend the book or not.  If you're someone who can tolerate a very unconventional and rambling writing style, the plot is excellent and it's worth reading.  If that sort of style does not appeal, I would say read Jason Fforde's books instead.	2005-10-01

I have my favorites and it's always a risk when picking up a book by a new author.  Big Love is definitely one that rises to the top of the Chick Lit book stack and I'm looking forward to reading more from Ms. Dunn. <br /> <br />I found myself really relating to Alison.  Ms. Dunn has a conversational writing style (a style I don't generally enjoy) that seemed more real and less contrived than most.  It really felt like a phone conversation from Alison, and not in the contrived way that some books use this style.  I laughed out loud several times while reading.  Not only was the character engaging and the writing enjoyable, but there were some deeper thoughts in the book, involving religion, religious upbringing, and love.  These were treated respectfully while maintaining the light entertaining tone of the book.   <br /> <br />I didn't give the book 5 stars because it seemed to end very abruptly.  I don't want to give it away (although it's entirely predictable) but Alison seemed to come to a realization and then 10 pages later the book was over.  I found her character so engaging that I wanted to hear more from her.   <br />	2005-09-11

Ms. Kinsella certainly got out of the Shopaholic rut with this new book! <br /> <br />Who hasn't thought at one time or another of chucking their career and moving off to a place where no one knows your name (sort of the Anti-Cheers :) )???  It's appealing at times when the day to day grind starts to get to you.  There were times when I could really relate to Samantha (although I do know how to cook and clean for myself, despite being an attorney).  In an engaging and entertaining way, Ms. Kinsella addressed the deeper subject of finding what is really truly important in your life and taking the direction that makes you most happy - even if it's unpopoular or if others don't understand.  Who can't relate to that?   <br /> <br />And, honestly, who hasn't fantasized about a relationship with the sexy gardener at some point?  :) :)	2005-09-09

Had I known from the moment I began reading that the story was going to go nowhere and what appeared to be the main plot was going to remain unresolved, I think I would have enjoyed the book a lot more.  Instead I kept trying to figure out the mystery, which was never resolved and I was left feeling cheated when the book ended.  Had there been some indication that the main point of the book was not who-killed-Robin, but instead a look into the mind of a 12 year old and her family/southern society lifestyle, my expectations would have been different and I wouldn't have felt so cheated.  After finishing the book, I went back and read the dust-jacket again to make sure I hadn't missed something that should have clued me in as to the kind of book this was.  There was nothing.  I felt somewhat mislead by the way the book was \\"teased\\" to the potential reader.   <br /> <br />All that being said, the writing style was excellent and descriptive in a way I wish more writers emulated.  Ms. Tartt isn't overly flowery, but definitely paints a very vivid picture of the characters and the envirnoment they inhabit.  Until nearing the end of the book when I realized the storyline was never going to resolve, I was very much enjoying the book. I found the character of Hely, the friend, particularly engaging.  He was well created, multi-faceted, and consistent.  As a book with excellent writing, I would recommend this book, but as a story I would not.	2005-08-13

Mr. Crichton is truly a master of suspenseful story-telling.  I found myself sitting in the car after arriving at a destination to continue listening to the CDs.  The characters are well-formed - at first some seemed a bit odd and inconsistent, but that is explained by the end.  The whole book occurs in a week -most of it in 2 days, so there is a lot of suspense and excitement packed in.  Overall, I'd recommend the book/audio book. <br /> <br />However, WHAT is up with Michael Crichton and the lectures?  I'm in the process of listening/reading the books I haven't already read.  I read State of Fear recently and felt like I was being beat over the head with envirnomental politics.  There was certainly less of that in Prey, but certainly the overall message was one of research ethics (or lack thereof) and the book ends with more of a lecture.  I just don't find that enjoyable, and I'm hesitant to read any new books he comes out with since there seems to be a trend toward this.  I understand, Mr. Crichton's books have always had a \\"when research goes bad\\" theme, but when reading fiction I don't want to be berated with the author's political/environmental/ethical viewpoints as much as Mr. Crichton has been doing recently.	2005-07-28

I didn't have time to reread the almost 1000 page book, but didn't want to be faced with not remembering who was dead and who was alive at the beginning of \\"Snow and Ashes\\".  This is a great audio abridged version of the book.  Just long enough to remind me of all the details and without leaving me like vast amounts of the story had been edited.   <br /> <br />I had not previously listened to any of the Outlander series, but wanted to mention the \\"reader\\".  Ms. James does a phenomenal job of dealing with characters who speak several languages with several different accents.  She switches easily betweeen Claire' British, Jamie's Scottish, Fergus' French, and Briana's American - all while keeping the story moving and making it easy to distinguish the characters.  Certainly not an easy task!  She should be applauded for the effort and I look forward to listening to the other books in the future.	2005-07-21

For Ms. Haigh's character development and descriptions I would give 5 stars easily.  The plot, however, never really seems to go anywhere - thus, the 4 star rating.  Not that I really minded as I very much enjoyed getting to know all of the characters in the book.  I enjoyed the book, but would have liked more of an over-arching point to it all. <br /> <br />In both this and Mrs. Kimble, Ms. Haigh does have a problem with segues, or more accurately, the complete and utter lack of them.  Clearly this is part of her writing style, but I find it a bit frustrating.  The reader starts a new chapter and spends a good page trying to figure out who the characters are and what they have to do with the chapter that just ended.  In this book, there was the further question of how much time had elapsed since the last chapter.  A simple segue or even a chapter title that indicated the year would have been very helpful in making the reading more smooth. <br /> <br />Overall, a very enjoyable read by a very skilled author.  I look forward to her next effort.	2005-07-21

There is more action in Goblet of Fire, but the characterizations and emotions are without match in Half-Blood Prince.  And, happily, there is none of the dragging of the plot line that seemed to occur through about 200 pages of Order of the Phoenix.   <br /> <br />When finishing the book (after drying a few stray tears) I found myself marveling at what an accomplished story-teller Ms. Rowling is.  She really has the teenage psyche down in this most recent book - from the mood swings, to the camaraderie, to the hormones.  She also has mastered the art of surprising her reader - sometimes even with an event the reader had anticipated.  I felt I could see and feel the setting and emotions of her characters.  Her style of writing and ability to draw emotions from her audience has improved with each book. <br /> <br />I look forward to Book 7.  Almost as much, I look forward to Ms. Rowling branching into another genre and writing other books.  Her style, characterizations, and story-telling would be well-received in any genre.	2005-07-21

I just don't look for this sort of \\"information\\" from my fiction reading, nor do I want to be repeatedly beaten over the head with it.  And that is how this felt.

I felt he was returning to the excellent storytelling he exhibited in A Time to Kill & The Firm.  Unfortunately, The Broker does not live up to this promise.  It seemed to move very slowly for much of the book.  I kept waiting for something to happen and then realized I only had 40 pages to read yet and still nothing had really happened!  I felt no sympathy for the main character nor for his plight, as he was being hunted down by everyone and their cousin.   He wasn't a very nice man and I didn't find any real revelation in his character that would indicate he had made some sort of turnaround.  I found myself sympathasizing more for Luigi, the main character's \\"handler\\" and for Teddy Maynard, the CIA head, than for the main character.   I hope Mr. Grisham's next book shows more promise and has more of an interesting story line.	2005-07-05

But, on the other hand, he's the author and he can weave and spin his story however he wants - it doesn't hurt that I happen to agree with him.  Despite the fact that at times, I felt like I was getting a civics lesson while listening to this book, I felt the characters were interesting (and if you're a fan of Patterson, you're already a fan of Kerry Kilcannon) and the story engaging enough to keep me listening through 18 (or was it 16?)

The first half of the book I enjoyed, but later (without giving away any details) I didn't find the plot was going in any real direction - it seemed all over the place.  There are some situations in the book that I found just ridiculous and unbelievable, which really isn't like most of Ms. Green's books.  I look forward to reading more of her books in the future, but if you haven't read any of hers yet, start with Jemima J or To Have and To Hold or Bookends.	2005-05-12

I'm starting to lose sympathy for Becky, she just simply refuses to grow up and learn.  That was cute for a while, but I'm starting to feel like Jess - that she needs to grow up!  She's still making the same stupid mistakes and still expecting others to just cover for her and it started to get a bit old in this book.   <br /> <br />That said, Ms. Kinsella is still entertaining and funny, so it was an easy read.

He wrote what he knew.  He finally returns to Clanton, Mississippi with both a great legal story (with the legal inaccuracies Mr. Grisham admits) and great characters - many of whom the reader will recognize from A Time to Kill.  Despite the fact that the main character is a journalist rather than an attorney, this book strikes some of the same tones as A Time to Kill.   <br /> <br />I have always thought A Time to Kill was Mr. Grisham's best book.  The Last Juror is on the same level.  The characters are fascinating.  The story is intriguing and has just enough twists and turns to be believable.	2005-01-03

Mr. Grisham clearly has an agenda and a message he wants to convery with this book.  Which is okay, because the story is still interesting and he doesn't beat the reader over the head (too much) with his clear dislike of mass tort litigation and the attorneys who handle those cases. I really enjoy reading Mr. Grisham's books.  For the most part - particularly the earlier books - they were mostly legally accurate, but still interesting (which CANNOT be said for the movies made from the books).  I'd like to see him return to the courtroom in his next book, where he really is at his best, like in A Time to Kill and The Rainmaker.  The King of Torts was an entertaining summer read.  I don't feel I wasted my time reading it, but I'm not sure if someone asked me in 6 months that I'd be able to remember the storyline.	2003-09-22

I started reading the Left Behind series when Assassins (the 5th - or so - book) came out.  The book jacket of that book sounded interesting so I went back to the beginning and read them all.  I'm not a particularly religious person and some of the religious messages in the books I find seriously offensive.  However, I have always been quite taken with the adventure story and with the characters of Buck, Chloe, Rayford, etc.  As each successive book contains less and less storyline and more religion, I have become less and less interested.

In this sequel, her life takes some unexpected and less reality based turns, which I found it difficult to relate to.  <br />My one caution to this book is that, much like with the writings of Dr. Seuss, I found myself starting to think in the stilted thought bursts that Ms. Fielding writes in.  <br />Overall, enjoyable, but not as groundbreaking or &quot;real&quot; as the original.	2001-05-13

Before writing my review, I must disclose that Rod Smolla was my professor for 2 classes during law school and one of my favorite professors.  That is  why I bought the book.  I don't like nonfiction.  I don't really like books  about the law.  I read about the law every day.  I didn't expect to enjoy  the book, but figured it would be something I would wade through because I  knew the author.  I was wrong.  This book is compelling.  <br />The crime at  the basis of the court case is heart breaking and the book HitMan (which I  have also read) is as offensive as anything I have ever read.  The author  portrays the victims and the convicted killers with appropriate compassion  and vilification and makes their story come alive.  But I found much more  interesting the battle within the author over his involvement in the case.   He gave lawyers a human face, one that the legal profession so desperately  needs.  <br />I recommend this book to lawyers and non-lawyers alike.   Understanding the complexities of the legal arguments is really not the  centerpiece of the book.  It is a story about a lawyer, as interesting and  plot-driven as any fiction story.  My only problem with the book is that I  wish I (and my classmates) were as intelligent and articulate as the  classroom discussions made us look.  :)	2000-08-15

The story is engaging and the characters have grown from the children they were in the 1st book.  Ms. Rowling's  imagination amazes me.  The detail she brings to this parallel world is  phenomenal.  I stayed up late several nights because I just could not stop  reading.<br />My only qualm would be reading this to small children.  There  are some truly terrifying parts of the book (even to an adult like me) and  some situations that seem to me to be inappropriate for children under 10  or so.  My recommendation to parents would be to read ahead of your child  so that you can prepare them for some of the more difficult and scary  parts.  You know your child and know what they can and cannot handle as far  as death and terror go, but be cautious of just reading to a small child.  As a child, this book would have caused me nightmares.  But with that said,  I think with proper parental input and encouragement any child would enjoy  the action, excitement, friendships, and lessons from this marvelous book.	2000-07-28

I still finished the book in under 2 days.  It's a quick read, but not as compelling as the earlier books in the series.  I was never that interested in the religious message of this series, but found the action, storyline  and characters so captivating, that I continue to read the series.  The  Indwelling spends a lot more time on the religious message, with Rayford's  epiphany and Tsion's out-of-body experience.  I agree with many of the  other reviewers that the authors should have gotten to Carpathia's  &quot;resurrection&quot; much quicker.  It wasn't a big surprise that it  happened during the funeral, but that was what the reader was waiting for.   The rest was filler.  And Chloe's crisis regarding Kenny (I don't want to  give anything away) seemed completely out of character for her.  I was  shocked by it, as Chloe has always been extremely logical and sensible.  I  will continue to read the remaining books, but I hope that the authors take  a cue from the review of this one and get to the action quicker.	2000-06-19

His characters had depth and interest and the story was engrossing with unexpected twists, heroes, and villains.  I finished it in 2 days.  Mr.  Deaver also managed not to commit one of my major pet peeves - setting a  story in a major city without adequate research as to the geography and  local vernacular.  The book, set in DC, differentiates between DC and the  NoVA suburbs just as people who live here do, but others do not.  His  characters also weren't referring to Dupont Circle as on the way from the  White House to the Capitol, or similar gaffes, as one major network TV show  regularly does.  One warning, if you live in DC Metro, this book might make  you check over your shoulder and notice those on the Metro with you a  little more closely.	2000-03-10

The plot is highly predictable and I never developed any real affinity for either of the narrating  characters.  The Alice character is quite possibly psychotic and I did not  feel the sympathy for her that I believe was intented.  I was never  entirely convinced that she was not guilty of the crime of which she was  accused.	2000-03-01

These are not the kinds of things you want to share with complete strangers.	1999-12-13

But the story in Left Behind (and Tribulation Force, at least as far as I've got) is  quite compelling even if you do not consider yourself a religious person.   The manner in which the characters deal with trying circumstances and  drastic changes in their world and outlook would be interesting to anyone.   In addition, the religious aspect has sparked many interesting debates  among my friends and family.  Any book that can do that is worth reading.   :)	1999-10-21
