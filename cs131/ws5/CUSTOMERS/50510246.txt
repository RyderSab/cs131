Whether I'm reading The World Atlas of Wine, the Complete Wine Course, Sotheby's Encyclopedia, Cote d'Or - whatever - I always turn to this book for help. It almost always provides me with the extra information I need to understand what I'm reading in the other books - and it comes with pronunciations!! While the information isn't as in-depth as The Oxford Companion to Wine, it is certainly easier to carry around. And again, there's that bit about the pronunciations...you have to have that...how else are you going to know, unless you're French or speak French, that Echezeaux, an important Grand Cru vineyard in Burgundy, is pronounced ay-shuh-ZOH.	2005-09-22

I gave it four stars, but accused it of leaving out \\"almost unforgivable\\" information. Looking through it again, I'm shaking my head, wondering if I was looking at a different book, perhaps Curious George, or Fox on Socks. The New Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia has information that is unavailable in any other credible book on wine.    This reference is AMAZING, and belongs on every wine lover's bookshelf, even if you have The Oxford Companion to Wine, The World Atlas of Wine, Ox Clarke's Encyclopedia of Grapes, and others. Many of the maps included in this book are superior to those found in The World Atlas of Wine (strangely odd), and nowhere can you find a more comprehensive listing of major wine producers. Every wine making country in the world is covered (as far as I know), and that is something lacking in other references. I don't mean to knock other references, but each reference has a slightly different slant, each provides information that the other doesn't. To me, this book, along with the aforementioned books, completes an unsurpassed reference quadrology.    If you're an oenophile, or a wannabe oenophile, you need this book on your shelf.    I offer my sincere apologies to the author for my earlier review.    Amazon's policies will not allow me to change the rating, but make no mistake: this is a five star book.	2005-09-22
US	50510246	RWBYB32W17B1N	0316011770	454028739	The Historian	Books	4	4	8	N	N	Wonderful blend of history and fiction	Ms. Kostova has three strengths as a writer: 1) her research skills are astounding; 2) her descriptions of people and places are top notch; and 3) she knows how to move a story along. <br /> <br />The latter two need to come with caveats, however. There was simply too much description. Yes, I was amazed at how clear and fresh all of her descriptions were. They were full of color, sound, and texture, but they slowed the story down. With regard to moving the story forward, she did a terrific job until the monks came along. <br /> <br />When I was halfway through this book, I was thinking FIVE stars all the way, even with the sometimes-tedious descriptions, and was certain that the reviewer who commented on the migration patterns of monks was being nitpicky. Then I encountered that section. For me, that was like a train derailing. I crept and crawled through that section, and when I finally emerged, it felt like I had been underwater for too long and was gasping much needed air. That said, I understand that the monks play a pivotal role in finding Dracula's tomb; I just wish that section had been briefer - much briefer. <br /> <br />The mix of fiction and history in this book was masterful, and the solid writing made those who called this \\"The Dracula Code\\" appear foolish, because The Da Vinci Code, while entertaining, wasn't well written. The Historian IS well written. <br /> <br />This wasn't meant to be a horror novel, even though it dealt with the horrors of Vlad Tsepes, but there were times that I felt little bugs crawling under my skin, or perhaps bats in my stomach. <br /> <br />Often it is best never to encounter the villain in the story. Tolkien, for example, never introduced us to Sauron, and this was a very wise choice. If not for a New York Times review of The Historian, I would have spent the entire book wondering whether I would meet Dracula, and if so, how she would communicate his intrinsic evil to the reader. Having read my share of fantasy novels, I have often found myself disappointed when the author introduces us to their version of \\"pure evil\\". It's not easy to do. I won't tell you whether Ms. Kostova pulled a Bram Stoker or a Tolkien, and don't read the NYT book review to find out. It will remove an enormous amount of suspense from the story. <br /> <br />Even with the suspense that the review relieved me of, the story was full of twists and turns, broken leads, surprises, etc., that made up for it. I can only imagine how much more I would have enjoyed this book (although the train would still have derailed when we hit \\"the monk section\\") if the NYT was more responsible. I'm jealous of those who didn't know what I knew. <br />	2005-09-13

No hints, no slight asides - NOTHING! More secrets are revealed in this book than in the previous three, and some of the events that occur are, to be a bit melodramatic, earth shattering. They will leave you numb. <br /> <br />But you won't hear anything about them from me. If I did, I would be cheating you of a magnificent experience. If reviewers had given away the ending of The Sixth Sense of Million Dollar Baby (not that I'm saying that the ending in this book is similar to those movies, mind you), both movies would have lost their \\"oomph\\" factor. So it is here. To breathe a whisper would be similar to breaking a blood oath. <br /> <br />I will simply say that this was the most satisfying book in this marvelous series to date. <br />Rowlings doesn't waste any time getting started. She immediately tosses us a giant bone on which to nibble, and we do, all the way to the end. And in between she weaves, as usual, her brilliant webs. Her superb combination of mystery and magic are on full display here. Moreover, her writing is more confident, improved. All writers worth a grain of salt get better the more they write, and this is certainly the case with J.K. Rowlings. <br /> <br />I'll leave you with this: enjoy! You will devour this book, and immediately yearn for the next. <br />	2005-07-16

And why does it make such little sense (to me at least) that the Bloors and/or Yewbeams don't want these kids found?\\" <br /> <br />There's good news here. While there is an issue with a *friend* being in a bad place, the book isn't entirely focused on rescuing that friend. There are other subplots running through the book, and most are quite interesting and satisfying. <br /> <br />While there was much to be intrigued by in the manner of some terrific new characters, the momentum that the last book began stalled here. Instead of the ending causing our mouths to water while waiting for the final book in the series, mine felt dry. <br /> <br />It doesn't take too much to guess what needs to happen next, and what probably will happen, but there isn't much in the story to make us yearn for the fifth book. That saddens me, because I liked the second book better than the first, and the third better than the second. <br />	2005-07-09

Truly, I have found that there was no greater revelation in my gustatory experience than when I first had a good glass of wine. Not a wine that had been left out and corked at a restaurant for three days, not a $4.99 bottle from the local supermarket, not two-buck-Chuck, or, god forbid, the jug wines of my parents day. That first good glass of wine opened my eyes to an amazing world that I didn't know existed. <br /> <br />When you have that first good glass, you seek out more, and during your search you discover that there are varietals you've never heard of: Viognier, Barolo, Carignan, Mourvedre, Tempranillo, and so many others. As you taste these wines, you realize this is a world you want to know more about. <br /> <br />This is the perfect book to start your journey into the \\"wonderful world of wine\\". While it is very well written, it is certainly not comprehensive (no introductory book of any kind could be!) but there are times when the author references something that 1) you may wish to know more about; or 2) you feel it hasn't been adequately explained. I would highly recommend purchasing The New Wine Lovers Companion, available here on Amazon for only $10.17 (i.e., not any great expenditure) and keep it next to you while you go through the book. It will greatly enhance your experience. <br /> <br />When you have finished with this book you will have a solid understanding of all of the major wine producing regions in the world, the varietals that come from them, the wines that are made, and so much more. <br /> <br />I myself work part-time in a wine store, and recommend this book to everyone who comes in wanting to know more. <br />	2005-07-02
US	50510246	R3R1MITXCX07GM	1555838197	433737843	Clay's Way: A Novel	Books	5	37	47	N	N	Raw and honest beyond expectation	In all honesty, I wasn't expecting to like this book because it was about surfers and wanna-be punk skateboarders. I ordered it only because of the rave reviews it received here on Amazon. <br />  <br />I'm glad Amazon has the extensive review system that it does. <br /> <br />It's rare for gay teen sexuality to be dealt with so openly as Mastbaum deals with it here. Other books I've read, that I've also enjoyed, deal mainly with coming out and emotional issues. The carnal and erotic aspect of their sexuality seems to get left out. I'd wondered about that, thinking that in today's ultra-conservative watchdog America such literature would be frowned upon by publishers. Thankfully, Alyson Publications did not. <br /> <br />The main character, Sam, so brilliantly written without what has almost become in this genre archetypal angst or self-pity, \\"spoke\\" openly about his intense sexual urges, his erections, his orgasms, his anger, his hatred, and his obsessions. Again - all without angst or self-pity. For Mastbaum to pull that off is a wonder. Sam was possibly the most honest character I've yet to come across in fiction of any genre. <br /> <br />Not to harp on sexuality, but so many books and films, even those that aren't dealing with gay/coming out issues, completely gloss over that a teenager has sexual urges. I've found this intensely frustrating, as both a reader and a writer, because - duh - I was a teenager and remember vividly what my experience was like. I also remember the experiences of my peers - both those that I knew and those that I didn't. At that age, it's very for guys to walk around with erections 24/7, and sex is almost all they think about. I knew intelligent guys that were so obsessed with sex that they found themselves wallowing with C averages instead of the A average they should have had. <br /> <br />I can't believe that Blair Mastbaum is twenty-five years old. He writes with assurance and poise that would make experienced writers jealous. Being thirteen years his senior, and sparsely published, I \\"know of what I speak\\". <br /> <br />I've spoken about the intense sexuality in this book, but there's far more to it than that, or Mastbaum's incredible way with words. Sam is utterly, absolutely obsessed and in love with Clay from the very beginning, although as the book progresses it becomes quite clear that it may be more obsession than love. Even Sam wonders if he's in love with Clay, or in love with who Clay is - if he simply wants to be as cool and self-assured as Clay is. The irony in all of this is that Clay isn't nearly as self-assured as he appears on the surface, and we see this as the novel progresses. That said, I wish we had gotten into Clay's head a little more. True, when he admits that his girlfriend caught him masturbating while looking at a picture of Sam, this is a significant revelation. We should be intuitive enough to guess at the rest - and we are. It's just that Sam was so potent, so full of anger, so confused, so obsessed, and we know that Clay was experiencing a tremendous amount of confusion. While we know that, I would have liked to *see* it. True, Clay broke out into a fit of hysterical crying at one point, cried more than once at others, and this speaks volumes to the disarray of his sexuality. Still, I can't help but wish that we saw something more akin to Sam's emotions, which were so raw on every page that they seemed to rent the pages, in Clay.  <br /> <br />That's my only complaint, and I can hardly call it a complaint. I breezed through this book, and was sad to see it end - but heartened that a sequel is in the works. It would be very interesting to see a sequel written, telling the same story, from Clay's perspective. <br /> <br />Read this book. It is, from what I've read so far, the most honest gay teen novel I've read. <br />	2005-04-05

One sister or brother is more popular than their siblings, one better looking, one smarter, or one more athletic. <br /> <br />This book focuses on a fifteen year old boy living in the shadow of his older brother, and that older brother is more popular, better looking, smarter, and more athletic. That's quite a bit to live up to. <br /> <br />Brad, the pimple-faced main character, is not without his talents. He is an excellent musician, although he quits playing his sax after his brother Tom \\"surprised\\" him by showing up at his first live gig. When Brad saw Tom he became so nervous that he completely blew it, and felt like the shadow he was under had grown longer. <br /> <br />The Brad spends the summer with his aunt in Albuquerque (he's from New Jersey), and being away from Tom's crushing shadow, begins to find himself as a unique individual. He discovers that he is Brad Randolph. Period. Not Brad, Tom's brother. <br /> <br />Mulligan does a good job portraying Brad. His character, his fears, and his deeply imbedded insecurities were extremely believable. There were only a few things that puzzled me. Brad had a best friend back home, Celeste, but never expressed romantic interest in her or any other girls - not while he was in Jersey, and not while he was in Albuquerque. His aunt didn't even wonder whether or not he had a girlfriend. This seems to be a rather glaring omission, as insecurities are generally #2 on a teenager's \\"Board of Worries\\". #1 is sex, and all that relates to it: dating, crushes, etc. <br /> <br />That aside, it was an enjoyable, entertaining, quick and easy read.	2005-04-03
US	50510246	R3EO8VFYZ1ZVHM	0439546559	559772555	Lucky	Books	4	5	5	N	N	I wanted to see one more act	Eddie De Oliveira is an extremely talented young writer. Seeing that he was born in 1979 was rather humbling. With another book to be released in August 2005, he has overcome what we in the writing industry call \\"resistance\\", and is a true professional, practicing his vocation - as opposed to an amateur who plays around with his avocation. <br /> <br />The description of the relationship between Sam and Toby - and HIM - is extremely realistic and tangible. It was difficult not to pity Sam as he found his attractions for Toby growing exponentially, although Toby remained distant. And then when Toby met Lucy, a girl that Sam saw first and fancied, although Toby approached her and hit her up, Sam's and Toby's relationship went into a tailspin. <br /> <br />Oliveira did an excellent job getting directly into Sam's head with regard to his fears, concerns and conflicts regarding sexuality. Am I straight - I *am* attracted to girls. Am I gay - I *am* attracted to guys. Am I bisexual - I *am* attracted to boys and girls. Sam actually searched the dictionary to try to find the right word to describe what he felt, and ultimately decided that he couldn't label himself. I've always referred to that as: you love who you love. If you love a girl, you love a girl. If you love a guy, you love a guy. <br /> <br />I felt there was a little too much rumination and focus on soccer, as opposed to direct action - such as dialogue, interaction between characters, etc. While the latter certainly existed, it seemed that rumination captured the majority. I also felt that his declaration of his sexuality came at a very strange time, and I was completely taken by surprise. That said, \\"coming out\\", whether as a bisexual, trisexual, whatever - sometimes just happens as it happens, and there is no real reason behind why or when. <br /> <br />However, I thought there was a third act that was missing here, and that would be Sam's interaction with HIM, the guy he had been casually eyeing and flirting with at soccer games. I understand that we our own imagination could fill the blanks for us, but after declaring a label-less bisexuality, his first romance with a guy would have introduced an entirely new element, and one that I think we should have seen. My recommendation would have been less rumination, and a final act with HIM. <br />	2005-03-19
US	50510246	R37C57LE64RCAA	0618111301	685999721	Peter	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Touching and unique coming of age story	Peter is a very well written book, is blunt, honest - almost painfully so - and NOT rife with typical stereotypes. It's not written in a high school setting where hormones are hopping out of everyone's garments. Instead, it takes place in the street, in the homes of the main characters, on the bike paths, and in Peter's head. <br /> <br />There was definitely a language barrier given the Aussie lingo. But it wasn't much of a holdup. You got the idea. <br /> <br />I did think that Peter's realizations about himself - after learning that his brother's friend David was a \\"poof\\" - came a bit too quickly. However, everyone comes to grips with their sexuality at their own pace. Sometimes the revelations don't even occur to a person until they're in their 20s, sometimes people know from birth. So it is entirely believable that Peter had absolutely no thoughts about boys whatsoever until he met David. Still, this is dubious, because let's face it, hormones are flying at an incomprehensible rate, so who was he fantasizing about? That topic is rarely discussed in gay teen literature. Perhaps it's thought of as too taboo. <br /> <br />However, once he started making the connection, his process was extremely believable. I particularly enjoyed the double dates he went on, and his rejection of Gloria. Walker's description of Gloria, for what it's worth, was spot on. David's support, when he hugged and held him, was truly a touching scene. <br /> <br />I loved that this book contained very, very few stereotypes. There was a slight overemphasis on the \\"masculinity\\" of bike riding and cars, but aside from that, I could find little fault. <br />	2005-03-19
US	50510246	R2IRO8BRDB7G1A	0060012218	103393582	Geography Club	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Believable and touching story	Opening the scene in a boy's locker room, where the main character who knew he was gay was afraid, on some level, that his sexuality was obvious to everyone around him, was brilliant. Every gay teen, male or female, has experienced this. Imagine a co-ed locker room - but then remove the expected normality of the guys checking out the girls. <br /> <br />A gay teen absolutely cannot look at other guys in the locker room, although most do. They live in constant fear of being discovered. However, that locker room is the one place where they get a glimpse of what they're missing out on. And what are they missing out on? From very early on (perhaps too early these days) boys and girls start dating, start learning about their attractions to each other, both emotionally and sexually, and they (hopefully) begin to mature. This gives them a tremendous advantage over gay teens, who normally don't have an opportunity to start youthful exploring that should have begun at the same age as their straight counterparts until after they're out of high school. Thankfully, there are attempts at correcting that in some of the more liberal areas of the country. So, all gay teens have at their disposal is the ability to look. They can't touch, they can't kiss, they can't wonder if they can ask another boy (or girl) out for a date...all of that is off limits. Kudos to the author for taking us right into this taboo area. <br /> <br />Russel, the main character, knew that he was gay, and wanted to find other gays. He turned to the internet (which has helped and hurt the gay community, and the book is still out on what side it comes down more) to find other people like him. He was surprised to find out that there was an entry for his hometown, was more surprised when there was actually a person in that room, and then *stunned* to find that the person in the room went to the same high school with him. Eventually they agree to meet, and when they do meet, Russel is shocked to discover that it'sKevin Lands, someone he thinks is \\"hot\\", and someone who had a role in the opening locker scene. <br /> <br />Russel decides to confide in one of his closest friends, and finds that she is a lesbian - and has a girlfriend. They discover one other person who is gay, and decide to form a club, and they call it the Geography Club, thinking geography was boring enough that nobody would attend. <br /> <br />There are some very interesting subplots, mostly involving Russel finding himself in the \\"in\\" crowd, and then finding himself in the \\"out\\" crowd very quickly. While \\"in\\", he does something that he hates himself for, as it makes him a hypocrite. <br /> <br />This handles typical teen gay situations very well, and covers a gamut of emotions, chief amongst those honesty and betrayal. <br /> <br />Highly recommended. <br />	2005-03-18
US	50510246	R3BRU20P92R8SM	0689857705	161188863	Rainbow Boys	Books	5	13	15	N	N	Should be mandatory reading for gay teens and their parents	When I looked at the cover for this book, I almost wrote it off as fluff. After all, there are three \\"pretty boys\\" on the cover, and frankly, that type of cover doesn't shout: \\"GREAT LITERATURE!\\" I'm glad I looked at the back of the book because I saw that it was indeed literature to be taken seriously, as it had received some rather impressive accolades. Given that, I decided to give it a shot. <br /> <br />I'm glad I did. <br /> <br />The author achieved something in this book that's difficult for even the most seasoned writers to do: he wrote from three different points-of-view, gave each character a distinctive voice, as well as unique personalities, with different problems and obstacles to overcome. <br /> <br />I thought at first that Kyle and Jason would be very similar people. The back of the book identifies Jason as a \\"jock\\" and Kyle as a \\"swim team star\\". Those descriptions aren't terribly far apart. However, \\"jock\\" carries with it a different stigma than does \\"swim team star\\", and Jason and Kyle are definitely very different people. <br /> <br />The author made an excellent choice starting the book from Jason's perspective. Kyle and Nelson were vastly more comfortable with their sexuality, so to start the book from one of their perspectives would have been to begin the story with little to no tension. In order to hook a reader, an author needs to introduce tension immediately. Jason was the most conflicted of the three, so he was the logical and perfect choice. <br /> <br />The author also did a tremendous job in that first chapter introducing us to all of the main players and probably plot lines. Beginning with Jason walking around the block three times while contemplating entering the brownstone where the \\"gay\\" meeting would take place, he then stepped back briefly and showed us the thought process that brought Jason to that point. He had called a gay hotline for youths three times, and we aren't privy to those conversations, unfortunately. Personally,I would have liked to know the type of questions Jason was asking. However, we are immediately introduced to Jason's thought processes, so it's easy to surmise what he may have asked. He imagined a room of \\"queers\\", with him in it, trying to imagine himself fitting into that group. The immediate picture he had was that of Nelson, who was the so-called type of homosexual that even a blind and deaf dog would know is gay. He knew that he wasn't like Nelson, he thought about his girlfriend of two years, but couldn't understand why he had intense dreams of naked men. Finally he decides to enter the brownstone, where the meeting is being held, and finds two other boys from his high school: Nelson and Kyle. Nelson was no surprise to him, but Kyle was. Kyle was not your so-called typical \\"queer\\", easily recognizable. Kyle seemed \\"normal\\". This threw Jason for a loop. So, to cut to the chase, a few things happened, and Jason went running from the room. <br /> <br />Nelson and Kyle both came to life in this chapter with very strong presences. Nelson was exactly as Jason expected - a flaming queen - and Kyle demonstrated sweet, kind gentleness, and we learn immediately in the next chapter that he had been infatuated with Jason for quite some time. (That's the only slightly unbelievable part of the book - that the guy Kyle's completely bonkers for walks into the meeting, and then they...well...read the book.) <br /> <br />I spent a lot of time talking about that first chapter because it's probably the most important chapter in the book. Everything is laid out very neatly. We know what to expect from Jason, Nelson, and Kyle. <br /> <br />What transpires throughout the rest of the book is touching and extraordinary. Kyle is in love with Jason. Nelson may or may not be in love with Kyle. Jason is in love with Debra, but he can't shake his interest in men and, especially, his blossoming interest in Kyle. <br /> <br />As with any book that deals with gay teenage issues, there are coming out scenes. It certainly isn't necessary in the case of Nelson, as I suspect he came out to his Mom when he was born. Kyle comes out to his parents, with mixed but very believable results. His mother went through very typical responses, his father was typically distant (although sometimes it's the reverse...every situation is different). Jason's family is very dissimilar to Kyle's. He has an alcoholic father and an enabling mother, and the father reacted violently when Jason came out. That was one of my favorite scenes in the book. I won't say why, in case someone is reading this and hasn't read the book. <br /> <br />I don't like to go through plot descriptions in reviews, because too often, even if you're careful, you give things away that could ruin it for the reader. So I'll leave it at this: Rainbow Boys is an exceptional book with believable, unique characters, all of whom are sympathetic. It's difficult to imagine someone reading this - gay or straight (if they're straight and have an open mind) - and not enjoying this book, both for the wonderful intricate story, and the author's laudable telling of the story through three distinct voices. <br /> <br />And if you're a gay teenager, this book should shine bright rays of hope into your life. I certainly hope that it does, because the highest percentage of teens who commit suicide are gay teens. This is exactly the type of book that should be mandatory reading for any gay teen. <br /> <br />As a matter of fact, it wouldn't hurt parents of gay teens to read this book either. Frankly, as I think about it, it should be mandatory reading for them as well. This book does an excellent job of displaying different \\"levels\\" of homosexuality (yes, specifically male homosexuality, but it's easy to make the references to lesbians). <br /> <br />Also laudable are information and references in the back of the book for: Organizing a Peer Group; Violence and Hate Crimes against Gays and Lesbians; Human Rights Campaign; Teen Sexuality, Advocates for Youth; Gay and Lesbian Teen Suicides; Gay and Lesbian Teen Services on the Internet; Youth Advocacy; and Youth Activism. <br />	2005-03-18

After fruitless searching, they meet up with a wholly unexpected guest: a school administrator who wonders why Darren isn't in school. Nobody knows what to say, and the administrator presents Darren with his birth certificate, enrollment papers, and other official materials, all of which are signed by Darren's hand - or upon closer examination, simply a very good forgery. <br /> <br />When I read on the inside flap that Darren was going back to school I groaned. I thought to myself: the author is really running out of ideas here, and is reaching. But I found that I was wrong. Darren being in school set up a string of intriguing events - some of them horrific - and one very interesting surprise. The surprise was that one his teachers was none other than...Debbie, the girl that he dated the last time he and Mr. Crepsley visited his town some twenty-five years ago, if I remember correctly. Some uncomfortable moments between the two of them pass, as Darren still finds himself interested in him (after all, they're still the same age, even if Darren only looks 15). Darren tries to kiss her, and Debbie withdraws - but the tension is obvious. I have to give props to the author for doing this. He's already offended every conservative on the planet with his books, and this didn't make it any easier. Good for him. <br /> <br />Darren meets up with another unexpected friend: Steve. He is overjoyed to see him, and happy that Steve appears to have forgiven him, even though in the first book Steve said that he would dedicate his entire life to hunting and killing all vampires. <br /> <br />Darren finds himself in a particularly sticky situation. The closer he gets to Debbie, and the closer the vampaneze get to her, he finds it necessary to confess that he is a vampire. Surprisingly, Debbie takes this rather well, and when their quest is explained to her, she insists on joining - even holding their own. <br /> <br />The ending once again is a decent cliffhanger, and as I'm writing this review, I realized that I liked this better than I thought I did while reading it. There were enough twists to make his previous books proud, and I'm anxious to read Killers of the Dawn. <br />	2005-03-17

His \\"guardian\\" is a former Vampire General, and they also have another Vampire Prince with them on the mission in addition to Harkat, the Little Person the review refers to. Other than that, it's correct. Also, I have no idea why this is claimed to be marketed for ages 9-12. This is clearly a teen series.<br /><br />After being blown away by The Vampire Prince, I expected the action to escalate in Hunters of the Dusk, and I must admit to a certain amount of disappointment. Personally, I don't like prophecies, even if they do add a slight amount of tension to the story. The reason I don't like prophecies is simple. I think they're words of wisdom from men (or women) who deem themselves wise. Even those making the prophesies admit that they're not entirely sure about them, so what's the point? Being told that they will have an opportunity to kill the Lord of the Vampaneze (a unique and interesting character) four times, and that if they fail only of them will survive, just doesn't sit well with me. Again, I understand the added tension, but I believe that the chase for the Lord of the Vampaneze is ripe enough with tension.<br /><br />There was a sidebar in Hunters of the Dusk that was very unusual for this series, and that was their visit with the sorceress. I really didn't see much point in that, as Mr. Tiny could have given them exactly the same information. Some might argue that he has his own dark plans, but seeing as he told them to go see her, he must have known what she would tell them...so...she seemed to be a pit stop that just wasn't necessary to the plot as a whole.<br /><br />One reviewer indicated that it was obvious that Steve was the Lord of the Vampaneze. Well...I think that `dum-dum-dum' concept was shot full of holes. And with regard to the rankings, you have to rate a book based on the age group that it's intended for. You can't possibly compare Dracula to this series, no more than you compare Dracula to The Da Vinci Code. They're very different series. I give Beverly Cleary five stars, but is she Bram Stoker? Sure...for kids. And I think that Darren Shan is Bram Stoker for teens that like vampires.<br /><br />That said, I don't think that this was the strongest in the series. For me, this lagged considerably, especially as I had to travel 25 miles to get the book, given that no local bookseller had it in stock. (And I live in Chicago, with many, many booksellers close to me.) There were still some good shocks and surprises, but it seemed to me that the author was starting to reach for his twists, which came so naturally before., no more than you compare Dracula to The Da Vinci Code.

I need to retract that statement.<br /><br />The tests that Darren undertook were challenging and very well written. And the author did not spare Darren an ounce of respite. Authors *need* to hurt their characters, and this author put Darren through the wringer. These challenges slayed Darren to the bone - burned him, scarred him, and at one point nearly killed him if not for an intervention from an unlikely source.<br /><br />Because of this, Darren is shamed, and the entire Vampire community is up in arms over what to do. Anyone who does not complete the Trials of Death, or has someone intervene on their behalf is dishonered, and the fate is death. As usual, the book is full of twists and turns, was delightful to read, and had a terrific, terrific cliffhanger.<br /><br />Also, there was a stunning turn of events that I'm sure left most readers of the book with their jaw on the floor.	2005-03-17
US	50510246	R1QY4HKZGHALD4	0316607096	818315156	Cirque Du Freak #6: The Vampire Prince: Book 6 in the Saga of Darren Shan (Cirque Du Freak: the Saga of Darren Shan)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Wow - some very, very big surprises here	This was an absolutely spectacular book, and as with the rest of the series, as soon as I finished it I wanted to read the next book immediately. Unfortunately, I couldn't find book seven (Hunters of the Dark) anywhere. All of the local bookstores had books one through eight, but nobody had book seven. I had to drive about 25 miles round to get book seven.<br /><br />However, Hunters of the Dark isn't the book being reviewed here. It's The Vampire Prince. As I indicated in earlier review regarding a book in this series, an author needs to hurt his character to create a sense of sympathy. You don't need to maim your character to achieve this. For example, Harry Potter was a sympathetic character (perhaps the most sympathetic character in all of children's literature, given the unparalleled sales of The Sorcerer's Stone) because he lived in a cupboard underneath the stairs and was denied the necessities of life, aside from food.<br /><br />The author is in excellent form, as he introduces new and entertaining characters, and his plots and twists (even though by now we've come to expect them) still surprise us. Also, Darren kills in this book - and the tenderness with which the author handles Darren's emotions is exceptional. For an author who has been chocking gore at us (though not gratuitously) for the past five books, this takes us back to the very first book which I still think is the best book in the series because of the conflicting emotions and stunning turn of events is the best book in the series.<br /><br />This is a very difficult book to review, for the subplots are so intricately woven that to comment on them would simply ruin the book. That's the problem with reviewing the Cirque Du Freak series. Commenting on events could ruin the book for other readers, and I certainly don't want any part of that.<br /><br />I will say that the ending surprised me, and I'm not sure how I feel about it, even having read books seven and eight. Still, it's an excellent and passionate book.llent and passionate book. <br />	2005-03-17
US	50510246	R3SH7ERW0FN5Z6	0312342519	184399102	Sideways: A Novel	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Outstanding character study of two severely challenged men	In my review of the movie, I suggested that the title was referring to two people walking sideways in the gutter - a euphemism for two people whose lives are slightly askew. Well, either the word sideways wasn't used in the movie, or if it was, only appeared sparingly, perhaps once. The book used the word often, and it's now very clear that sideways refers to being exceptionally drunk. <br /> <br />There are some differences between the book and the movie, which is to be expected. Miles isn't nearly as frumpy and unattractive (sorry...) as Paul Giamatti's character, although he is unquestionably as neurotic and mentally unstable. Also, I didn't recall Jack as having a lot of money. Here it seems he did, as they piled case after case of wine into an SUV. In the movie, it was - fittingly - a convertible. <br /> <br />I loved the movie, and not only because I love Pinot Noir. It was a great character story about two men who struggled to come to terms with their own shortcomings. In that, the movie was unfailingly faithful to the book. <br /> <br />I read the book as if I were being chased by a forest fire. I'm a wannabe oenophile, so reading their discussions on wine - the tastings, the aroma, how the wine showed on the palate, how it finished - all of that was incredibly invigorating. But beyond that, it's just a terrific story. <br /> <br />My only complaint is that the author tosses some big words around, and while it's understandable, to an extent, because Miles is a writer, at times it was a bit much. For example, the word enervate is used several times throughout the book. A word like that shouldn't be used more than once, in my humble opinion. There are other examples, but that pops to mind. <br /> <br />Even though there were slight differences between the movie and the book, the movie was very faithful to the book, and the book was a joy to read. It's difficult to say which I enjoyed more. <br /> <br />The one thing that I definitely missed was Mile's brief monologue on why he loved Pinot Noir. In the theater, when he did that, I wanted to run out to the nearest wine store, grab a decent bottle, and chug it as if it were a beer. I guess I'll have to buy the screenplay. I was really looking forward to reading that description in the book, as I was certain it would be even more detailed, and would make me even thirstier. <br />	2005-03-04

Given Mr. Crepsley's odd silence and distant behavior, the boys conclude that Mr. Crepsley may be involved in the deaths. They decide to trail Mr. Crepsley when he leaves at night, to see where he is going and what he is doing. And they find out - and that's where the nightmare really begins. <br /> <br />I won't discuss what actually happens, but I'll say this: you might think you know at least part of what's going on, but when you get the full explanation, you'll realize that you really didn't have a clue. <br /> <br />The only thing that I find slightly annoying about this series is that Mr. Crepsley - a very well respected vampire - seems to make quite a few mistakes. Without these mistakes (withholding information, for one), there would be no story. I'd like to see that change. <br />	2005-03-03
US	50510246	R6UPUPXNSOIX	0316168815	784206304	The Lovely Bones	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Sensational and unique story of suffering and redemption	We all know the general story by now, so rehashing it won't help much. I simply want to comment on the content and the concept. <br /> <br />I found Sebold's narrative clean and refreshing. There were very, very few attempts at flowery language, and she told her story straightforward with bare hints at metaphor. We weren't assaulted with a bevy of \\"big\\" words used merely to impress the reader; rather, she spoke to us clearly, much as a fourteen-year-old girl would. How invigorating to see an author - especially a first time author - not try to impress us with their remarkable and extensive vocabulary (or at least their sensational ability at thumbing through a thesaurus). <br /> <br />Regarding the concept: I don't know why in the world it took me so long to read this book. When I saw it in hardcover, and read the very first paragraph, I was inexorably and inexplicably linked to the book. I knew that I had to read it, but chose not to until just now. Who knows why? I've been researching Teen and Young Adult literature for the past year and a half, so perhaps I was afraid to break the rhythm. Whatever it was, I'm glad that I finally picked this up. <br /> <br />I'm unaware of any other book to tell a story from this unique point of view. First time writers are told not to end a first person book or story where the main character dies at the end, so instead Sebold started with her character already dead. That's absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br />I was on a plane while reading the majority of this book, and there were times that I really had to fight to hold back from crying. Sebold's management of the family's immediate reactions, and the reactions as the family managed to struggle through their various degrees of acceptance was beautifully told, especially the plight of the father. He was a tortured, misunderstood (perhaps even by himself) character who brought so much life onto every page he appeared, even though he was in a downward spiral that was part of the reason his wife finally left him and found her way working in a winery. <br /> <br />The idea of a person having their own special heaven was just wonderful. Sebold could easily have written about heaven as most people envision it, but she created something slightly different, believable, and refreshing. <br /> <br />There were a few scenes that I questioned, and had problems with, but they were minor, and to divulge them would be giving away some crucial plot points. Even though there are over two thousand reviews of this marvelous book, I'm sure there are many people that haven't read it yet, so I don't want to ruin anything for them. <br /> <br />Enjoy this rare treat. It's equal is not likely to come around any time soon. <br />	2005-03-03

Not so with The Vampire's Assistant. If anything, this had more steam than the original.<br /><br />What's very impressive with this series is the wonderful pacing. The books are nearly impossible to put down, because at the end of every chapter there's a hook to draw you into the next chapter. As a result, I tend to read these books in one sitting.<br /><br />Perhaps even more impressive is the risks that the author takes. In the first book, Mr. Crepsley, a vampire, \\"killed\\" Darren Shan (who is \\"writing\\" the books) to make him a vampire, and take him away from his family. These are gut wrenching and terrifying things; even an adult can't help but cringe at the thought of a child being removed from their family. In this book, the author goes one step further. Darren has an aversion to drinking human blood, but instead of sounding like a whiny brat, his protestations are perfectly aligned with the nature of his character. In other words, the tone - the character's voice - stays the same. Mr. Crepsley is pushing Darren to drink human blood, stressing that Darren will die if he doesn't. How Darren comes to drink human blood shocked me, and would, I imagine, shock the socks off a nine year old.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about the book was the silly and ridiculous \\"costume\\" that Darren was given to wear. That didn't make sense to me. With all of the money that the circus brings in, and the seeming endless amount of money that Mr. Crepsley has, why not a stage costume (the \\"pirate\\" costume he was given), and then a regular pair of Levi's and a suitable shirt with sneakers?<br /><br />That, though, is a minor - if irritating - point. I loved this book, and am hurrying my way through the series.<br /><br />And to think I don't really care much for stories about vampires, as I've always considered them blas&eacute;. My mind has been changed - for this series, at least.	2005-03-03

All are ominous things. In this book, we meet them all.<br /><br />We also see that Darren is really starting to mature. He's learning to stand on his own, to make his own decisions, and developing courage and bravery that although it may be a little misguided, is still appropriate for his character.<br /><br />In Vampire Mountain, Mr. Crepsley and Darren make the trek to - of all places - Vampire Mountain. A Vampire Council is convening, and there are a number of issues to discuss, not the least of which being Mr. Crepsley's turning such a young boy. I found it odd that when Mr. Crepsley was being questioned by the Vampire Princes he made no mention of exactly why he turned Darren.<br /><br />This book was full of action, the chapters still ended with hooks that drove you to the next page, and had a terrific cliffhanger. There was also a rather unbelievable scene involving polls and bars and a very, very talented warrior. I had a hard time buying that scene, and it's one of the reasons I felt that this was the weakest book in the series. I'm still giving it four stars, so obviously I thought it was a very good book.<br /><br />I'm interested to see what happens in book 5, when Darren continues through his tests. I just hope that the tests are unique and not of the garden variety. Unfortunately, the way they're starting out, it seems that they may be. That said, the author has successfully twisted things around before, so I'm looking forward to him doing exactly that in book 5.	2005-03-03

The main character, Shawn, has been completely disabled by the misfortunes of cerebral palsy. At birth, a blood vessel exploded in his brain \\"in exactly the 100 percent perfectly wrong spot\\". This has left him entirely paralyzed, without the ability to move any of his muscles. <br /> <br />The first chapter is a brilliant piece of writing. Before we know that Shawn is entirely disabled, he tells us the good news and the bad news of his life. The good news is that he's lived on Earth for fourteen \\"(almost fifteen!) years and that he remembers everything that he sees or hears. The bad news is that he is a \\"retardate\\", a total retard. He tells us that everyone thinks that he is stupid, that his brain doesn't work, then saying: \\"They don't know that's only partially true\\". <br /> <br />What we get to see throughout the rest of the book is what it *might* be like inside the head of someone who has cerebral palsy, and it's fascinating. Shawn speaks of being attracted to women, speaks of not being able to control himself \\"down there\\" (although that has very, very minor mention in the story), goes into details about the seizures he has when he blacks out, what he hears other people saying when he comes out of him (very telling and intriguing), and that he believes his father is trying to kill him. <br /> <br />He has good reasons for thinking so. His father has commented on his \\"uselessness\\", although doing so, perhaps, from a loving place. He has also said to Shawn in a whisper, \\"Maybe it would be better if I ended your pain?\\" The father's torn emotions are nearly as powerful as Shawn's. <br /> <br />The voice in this book is so powerful and strong, Shawn's thought processes so infectious, that we are live with him on the very first page. The book has an interesting ending, which may seem to break a cardinal sin of writing, but as we never really know the ending, we can't be certain of that. <br />	2005-02-16

Sure, there were sections that dealt with his childhood, but the most straightforward, poignant, and powerful poems were those that dealt with very mature topics: specifically, *after* he graduated from high school. <br /> <br />Some of the poems, particularly those dealing with his friend Ben and the dissolution of his relationship, are very touching. Some are a little confusing, and I found myself backtracking to figure out who was being referred to in the poem, what the topic was, and its relevance in that particular place. Poetry, it seems, is intentionally misleading at times, and I find that to be an annoying characteristic. <br /> <br />That said, I myself have a wealth of experiences from elementary, junior high, and high school that are ripe for writing, as they are devastatingly powerful. In my own writing classes and seminars, teachers have literally begged me to write about them, rather than the \\"typical\\" YA that I'm working on, which is more fantasy based. The problem was, I didn't know how to do it. I didn't want to write a straightforward story, because the format just didn't seem right. This book has given me some insight onto how to put my experiences onto the page. So for that - I'm greatly indebted. (Especially if I get published. &lt;grin>) <br />	2005-02-14
US	50510246	R3GSVTKKP7T98Q	0066236096	17815923	The Dulcimer Boy	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Frankly, it's just unbelievable - but well written	I'm giving this three stars for the strength of the writing, not the story. <br /> <br />Regarding the writing, it was splendid, strong, very textual. However, not much happened in this book, and when I finished it I had many questions. I'm unsure of how many questions I should share in this review, because, unlike other reviewers who lay out entire plotlines, I find that to be a betrayal. <br /> <br />The biggest question I had was this: why in the world did William leave Jules? He loved his brother immensely; that was made clear. I have tried to get my mind around that, tried to understand what the author was attempting to communicate with that, but I can't come up with it. There isn't a chance in the world that I would have left my brother, who couldn't speak, alone with the absolutely miserable, horrible people that they were forced to live with. And they were horrid. Horrid! <br /> <br />I need to speak to another question. The two boys, William and Jules, were left on the porch of their aunt and uncle by, who turns out to be, their father. I'm not giving anything away here, because frankly it doesn't turn out to be any great surprise and has absolutely no significance (which is a detriment to the story), and the father, frankly, shows himself for being an idiot. He actually thought his children would be better off with the Carbuncles, who were awful, horrible people. I do admit that giving them the name Carbuncle was quite clever - carbuncle is defined as a severe abscess or multiple boil in the skin, typically infected with staphylococcus bacteria. That fairly well sums up the Carbuncles. Carbuncle also has a second meaning, referring to a gem, but that does not play into this story whatsoever. There is no dual identity, no juxtaposition of their dealings with the children they accept on their doorstep. They are despicable people. Period. <br /> <br />And that goes back to my two questions. Why did William leave Jules? On a personal note, I'm adopted - William and Jules were twins - and I would have taken my \\"brothers\\" with me when I escaped from the \\"abscesses\\". Wouldn't a twin have felt stronger than I would have? OF COURSE. Also, why did their father think they would be better off with these boils? We're never told, and I don't think that any hints were offered - unless I missed them, and I don't think that I did. <br /> <br />I found myself frustrated by this book, and I *really* didn't want to be. With a title like THE DULCIMER BOY, you can't help but expect marvelous things. For me, it didn't work. <br /> <br />Like I said, the strength of the writing gives it a three star rating. Otherwise, it would have received a two. <br />	2005-02-08

This is, quite simply, one of the best books I've ever read in my life. <br /> <br />I'm not autistic, so I have no idea how accurate this was. However, seeing that one of the spotlight reviews here on amazon was written by an autistic person, it seems as if the author was spot-on in his depiction of the difficulty of being Christopher. <br /> <br />But this book is so much more about being autistic, so much more about a mystery involving the death of a dog, so much more about the journey that Christopher makes. This book has *layers* upon layers of subplots (though they may not seem apparent unless you're an experienced reader and you're looking for them) and twists and surprises. It starts out seeming to be a simple story of an autistic child trying to solve the murder of a dog. That premise, in itself, is an extremely intriguing one, and was what caused me to purchase the book. Imagine my surprise when I quickly discovered that this book had so much more to offer. <br /> <br />This book was about real life. In real life, situations can present themselves as a mystery, and then you find that the situation isn't a mystery at all - that it's really a situation regarding emotion. Then you see that it's not a mystery, it's not a character piece, it may just be a situation of triumph over adversity. Generally in fiction you either have a mystery, a character piece, or a story about triumph over adversity. Rarely do you come across a story that encompasses all of that, and more. It takes an exceptional writer to perform such a task, and Mark Haddon has done it in this book. <br /> <br />This is the kind of book that, when I finished reading it, made me want to go back through several reviews of books that I've given five stars to and reduce them to four. Or at the very least beg amazon to allow me give this six stars. That's happened twice in the last couple of months. First with Million Dollar Baby, and now with THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME. <br /><br />To say that it is an extraordinary piece of literature doesn't begin to describe it. It is remarkable, exceptional, amazing, astonishing, astounding, marvelous, wonderful, sensational, stunning, incredible, unbelievable, miraculous, phenomenal, prodigious, and spectacular. <br /> <br />I was moved to tears, and it isn't often that literature does that to me. If you're wondering whether or not to read this book, stop wondering RIGHT NOW. Buy this book. <br />	2005-02-06

For a book aimed at this age group, you can't ask for much more. <br /> <br />In one of the cleverest presentations I have ever seen, the author leads us through a contest held at school for businessperson of the year. The book is Howard's chronicle of that contest, including - as the title brazenly states - his confe$$ion$ and $ecret$ that will cause him to win the contest. Because, as he tells us very pointedly in the beginning of the book, he is absolutely going to win. He has tremendous, enviable, and infectious confidence. I would very, very much like to see more of Howard J. Fingerhut, and fervently hope that the author will write more about him. I firmly believe that this is a character that should be in the canon of \\"great characters\\" in children's fiction. <br /> <br />This book had it all for me. Life lessons, learning lessons (a character must grow,  and we watch, affectionately, as Howie grows), and several sections of side splitting laughter.

I couldn't imagine a book written for young readers that took the time period seriously, and gave it it's full measure. But this book does. It even includes a glossary at the end, something that is invaluable to those unfamiliar with the times, as well as a briefing on the real history behind the fiction. <br /> <br />I read this book straight through, starting it at midnight, and finishing around 1:30am. I had expected to read perhaps ten pages, and then pick it up the next day, but I was so surprised at how realistic the story was, how aptly the author painted the period - in other words, completely enthralled - that I couldn't put it down. I kept making excuses to continue reading, and finally when there were only forty pages left, I just said to heck with it, and finished it. <br /> <br />The only concern I have regarding the book was that the mystery didn't start until page 50 or so. Generally, an author needs to hook their readers in within the first two pages or they've lost them. I hope this didn't cause the author to lose any readers - it certainly didn't lose me. I'm looking forward to reading more of these mysteries.  <br />	2005-02-01

The author wasn't kidding when he told us that this was going to be a story that didn't follow typical conventions. It was a wonderfully told story, with action that pushed the story forward from chapter to chapter. He used the device of short chapters, sometimes when they weren't necessary, to fuel that action. If writers write in long chapters, especially in books meant for children, their interest is lost, because they find themselves meandering. But when the chapters break, that implies (almost without the reader being aware of it) breakneck action.<br /><br />I'd love to discuss the surprise ending, as it was something I was NOT expecting whatsoever. But to do so ruins the surprise ending. I hope reviewers here haven't done that. And some of the things that made that ending possible were truly gruesome. This was a terrific story. It's the second book I've read where I've begun in bed and stayed awake until finishing it (about an hour and a half). I'm really looking forward to reading more, and was glad to see that there is much more enjoyment ahead.	2005-02-01

But instead of seeing this tale through a typical narrative, we see this character's growth through letters that he writes to his favorite author, Mr. Henshaw.<br /><br />Cleary does a wonderful job demonstrating that growth, through decisions he makes and, most impressively, small, barely perceptible improvements in his writing.<br /><br />I was quite surprised when Leigh expressed anger first at Mr. Henshaw for being late in answering the ten questions he sent him, and second for Mr. Henshaw asking Leigh to answer ten questions about himself. Leigh went from \\"Your friend\\", \\"Your Best Reader\\", to \\"Your Disgusted Reader\\".<br /><br />One of the things that Mr. Henshaw suggested was that Leigh keep a journal. Leigh did so, and that's where we see the most tremendous growth of his character, as he talks about his feelings about his mom, his dad, and himself.<br /><br />It's a wonderful book for kids, but also a terrific read for adults. Beverly Cleary never disappoints.	2005-01-23
US	50510246	RJDRULMTFORPH	0689873255	873064125	Full Tilt	Books	5	22	26	N	N	Very intelligently written children's book	Full Tilt is one of the most impressive \\"children's\\" books I've read in years. I used quotes because the writing was terrific and intelligent, the characters (especially the main character - which is common when a story is told in first person) refreshingly real and alive, the author made frequent use of strong, powerful metaphors and similes that resonated throughout the entire work, and he did this while creating remarkable tension that would drive any reader from the first page to the last. In short, this was a children's book written on the level of an \\"adult\\" book. <br /> <br />When finishing this, I thought to myself: I really wish that I was writing a book report instead of a review, because the ending is so powerful and meaningful that I want to discuss, dissect, and analyze it for whoever reads what I write about this. It's a powerful, moving, intelligent, evocative ending that was cleverly written and plotted, with the groundwork for it laid out with grace and care through the entire book. <br /> <br />There are already plot descriptions on this page from School Library Journal, so I'll skip that, as I think they did a better job than I could have. Instead, I'll comment on why I found this book so impressive. <br /> <br />Literature (yes, I'm using that big word in a review of a children's book) is about character. If you don't have solid characters with real feelings, real experiences, real *souls*, you can't have a truly good book. You might get a bestseller - let's face it, lots of best sellers are filled with empty sacks that pass for characters - but you won't have a good book. <br /> <br />The most important thing about characters is that they have to grow, even if it's not in a positive direction. He/she needs to pass through experiences, those experiences need to evoke emotion, and they need to add up to growth (or change - just in case someone wants to get semantic on me and say that negative growth isn't real growth). <br /> <br />The growth of the main character, Blake, was the most remarkable element of this book. The author plotted his development in a 199-page book as carefully as I've seen authors of adult fiction do it in 900 pages. As he faces the various fears that other plot descriptions mention, he grows from each one of them - and they all lead neatly into the climax. <br /> <br />I mentioned that this book was written intelligently. As the main character was somewhat of a brainiac (he was graduating high school one year early and was slated to attend Columbia University in New York), we could expect some insightful introspection - and we got it.  <br /> <br />During one of his challenges, he is in a house of mirrors. To quote from the book: <br /> <br />\\"I did my best to keep from looking in any more mirrors, but it was harder than you might think. Once you started looking into those mirrors, it was next to impossible to look away. I guess we all can't help peeking at our own imperfections, just like we can't help scratching a scab that keeps itching. When those imperfections are pasted across your face like that, exaggerated and magnified, it's hard to find all those good thoughts you have about yourself. If you believe those distorted reflections too deeply, you'll get out of the maze.\\" <br /> <br />During another challenge, when one of Blake's friends attacks him in order to escape the terrors of the carnival and he survives his friends attack, he comments: <br /> <br />\\"They say you never know who's the real hero and who's the real coward until you're looking death in the face. I've always been afraid of plenty of things, but fear isn't what makes you a coward. It's how depraved your heart becomes when fear gets pumped through it. I would never climb over the backs of my friends to save myself.\\" <br /> <br />Insights such as these are peppered throughout the book, and make the exciting tension of Blake's challenges that much more interesting, because during and after each challenge he learnssomething more about himself - all of which he needs to overcome the final challenge. <br /> <br />Please ignore the one star review given by another reviewer. This is exceptional literature. <br />	2005-01-15

He isn't a genius, but he's remarkably precocious for his age. I was asked to read books in this series because my brother requested that I write a book for my nephew for Christmas 2005. Frankly, the thought terrified me, as I've only written for older children and very mature, topical adult non-fiction. <br /> <br />Reading this book brought me back to the delightful days of Encyclopedia Brown. As I've never been the most clever person in the world (another reason to be terrified to write a book like this - I'm not sure I could craft a credible mystery), I rarely figured things out before Encyclopedia Brown did. <br /> <br />None of these children have the mental acuity that Brown did, but they all possess one indispensable character trait: perseverance. <br /> <br />The story is well told, well illustrated, and fairly flawless in its execution. A famous author is invited to come to town for a book signing, but doesn't show up. As Dink, the central character in this story, received a letter from the author stating that \\"Short of being kidnapped, nothing will keep me from coming!\\", he is immediately suspicious - as all children would be - that the author was kidnapped. Within that letter is the first clue, and I'm embarassed to say that I missed it. In fact, I missed every single clue - although in my defense, I really wasn't trying to puzzle anything out. (That may be an excuse...) <br /> <br />Ron Roy did a very good job of providing just the right amount of clues, the right amount of intrigue, and he peppered the story with characters that would be intriguing to children. I say - bravo! Job well done.	2005-01-14

Nevertheless, if Amazon didn't exist, I would have purchased the book.<br /><br />Luckily I didn't have to. &#60;grin&#62; I received this yesterday as a Christmas present, and it took quite a while to pry my eyes away from it. First I explained to all present (whether they cared to hear it or not) that the picture on the slipcase was the tower of Isengard, drawn by Tolkien himself as he intended it to look. They wondered why the tower in the movie was so harsh and foreboding, and I explained to them that the tower in the movie was a representation of Saruman's treachery, whereas in the \\"real\\" world of Tolkien Isengard was originally a fortress of Gondor - for the Dunedain, specifically, if I remember correctly.<br /><br />When I slipped the book out of its jacket and felt the supple leather of the book itself, I ran my hands over it several times. I couldn't have felt like a bigger geek if I had tried! But it is gorgeous leather - so far superior to the beautiful collector's edition that there is simply no comparison between the two books.<br /><br />It was interesting to note that a large amount of emendations were made to the text, and that a book will be published next year detailing each one, and the reasons they made it. One of the reasons I wanted the book (other than I collect hardcover LOTR editions) was specifically to see the emendations, so when this book they spoke of is published, I will probably reread LOTR for the first time in years. It should be fascinating to see what the changes are.<br /><br />With the combination of the supple cover and the gilded pages, the high quality of the pages themselves, this book is a treasure: easily worth the price of a shirt woven of mithril.	2004-12-26

But there are a host of problems with this work.    It's rather easy to see that Cormier was heavily influenced by Tolkien, as there are similarities in characters, situations, and places that are, frankly, too numerous to count. As I started coming across these similarities, I made notes of them with the intention of including them in this review, but instead decided to include only one because there were just too many. Worse yet is that it doesn't stop with Tolkien. There are hints of Ursula LeGuin, Raymond Feist, Terry Brooks, David Eddings, Stephen Donaldson, Piers Anthony, Robert Asprin, J.K. Rowling, C.S. Lewis, and Robert Jordan. If there are more, either I didn't read the books or they have long left my memory.     The one similarity that I'll mention is that there is a wizard whose name begins with \\"Ga\\", and that is an unwritten cardinal sin. No aspect of Gandalf's character can in any way be mimicked. If that happens, whether it is a simple thing like the similarity of a name, or the similarity of a situation (which also occurred, and made me put the book down in absolute shock), there's a certain amount of doom immediately associated with the character. The similarities to Gandalf don't stop there, but I will. Gallund (the character I'm referencing) also bears similarities to Obi Wan Kenobi. If you read the book, you'll see what I mean.    Sometimes similarities are purely coincidental. For example, many think that Jenny Nimmo's works featuring Charlie Bone are Harry Potter rip-offs. Having communicated directly with the author on several occasions, I know this is not the case. She has never read the Harry Potter books, so any similarities there are exist mainly because both authors are drawing from the same mythological or folk sources.    Perhaps Cormier didn't read all of the writers I've listed above. But I'm willing to bet that he read most of them, as they are splattered all over this book.    Ilien, the main character, was incredibly annoying. Yes, he's only twelve and can't be expected to know everything, but he asked more questions than that annoying person that seems to be in every class you've taken in high school or college, and you just wish that person would shut up. In this sense it reminded me of Eragon, but I doubt that Eragon had an influence on this book as they were published the same year.    I had a very hard time reaching the end of Nomadin, as I was so distracted by the similarities to other works and also by some rather odd inconsistencies (a character claims that NiDemon spelled backwards is Nomadin - that's unbelievably glaring, given the importance of the claim).    Originality is one of the keys to a good story. While there are some original elements, there are far too many that aren't. It simply destroyed the story.    I've read that this book is under consideration by a major publishing house. If that turns out to be true, then perhaps I'll read the next book in the series, because I'm quite certain that a good editor would have fixed many of the things I had problems with. If it's not picked up by a major publishing house, then I won't bother - because I know I'll just be in for more of the same.	2004-12-24

If you are, this is the perfect book for you. If you're not, then this little book merely contains some words that your abridged Webster's doesn't, but that the Oxford English Dictionary (which is available by subscription online) does. <br /> <br />Some of the words included in the dictionary surprised me, as I thought they were rather commonplace: rationale; Adonis; forthwith; talisman, and many others. <br /> <br />Still, I do enjoy thumbing through the pages from time to time, discovering obscure words with greater ease than I would if I were perusing the twenty-volume Oxford English Dictionary that sits atop the hutch on my desk. <br /> <br />One other thing the book does is take common words that are misused, such as tortuous, and \\"set us straight\\" as to its real definition. <br /> <br />I think that this book would have been more useful - as opposed to simply being an interesting little reference book - if it had been divided perhaps into two sections: Words That Are Misused\\", and \\"Words For People Who Want To Appear Extraordinarily Literate\\". Yes, there was a touch of derision in the latter title; it's very difficult to imagine working most of these words into conversation, much less a term paper, essay, short story, novel, or a longer work of non-fiction. Why? Because if you use a word that people don't understand, you lose your reader. And as a writer, that's the very last thing you want to do. <br /> <br />As long as you don't try to use most of these words, it's a terrific little book. <br />	2004-12-14

While the former book has been invaluable, so has this - Red Wine for Dummies. <br /> <br />As always, the language is very accessible and the subject material easy to understand, even when some of the more difficult or intimidating aspects of wine are discussed (such as when and why to decant, picking a wine, a guide to wine terms, etc.) <br /> <br />The descriptions of the grapes themselves are marvelous. For example, here is the description for a Zinfandel (yes, Zinfandel is a red grape - White Zinfandel [all apologies to those who like it] is a wine made by ruining the grape): \\"The Zinfandel grape gives good color to the red wines made from it, along with bramble-berry fruit flavors and aromas and a spicy character. The intensity of the wine varies according to where grapes grew and how old the vines are; some very old (80 to 100 years) vineyards make wines that are full bodied and dense with flavor. More typically, Zinfandel makes wines that are medium bodied, with succulent fruit and medium tannin.\\" Sure there are descriptions in fancy wine magazines that are more complete, but chances are you wouldn't have the slightest idea what they're talking about. <br /> <br />This book also covers regions where wines are made, climates, soil, and everything that goes into producing a good red wine. It's a superb book for a beginner. <br /> <br />	2004-12-13

I say real, because I have been enjoying wine (red, mostly) for the better part of eighteen years. However, I have never gotten more serious than having a very limited knowledge of grapes and particular blends. For example, I knew of Cabernet Sauvignon, the regions of Bordeaux and Burgundy, Chardonnay, and eventually came to hear of Merlot. Six years ago, I saw Cabernet Franc in a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, and was excited there was another grape of which I had not heard. Soon after that, it was Shiraz. Then something happened in the last six months - perhaps it was tiring of drinking cheap wine (Charles Shaw) - I decided to spend the extra money and branch out. I started talking to sommeliers at restaurants and stores, asking questions, and while I have only grazed the surface on what there is to know about the breathtaking enormity of the world of wine, my knowledge has increased notably. <br /> <br />Part of the reason for that is this little book. I picked it up at a retailer (sorry Amazon!) because I noticed it on the shelf and it had a very inexpensive price tag. Flipping through the pages, I realized this had some good information in it - enough at first glance to justify spending a small sum. <br /> <br />That small sum has paid dividends. While the title is pretentious, the book itself is not. It begins by introducing us to the world of wine, describing what wine is, the grapes that are used to make wine, different wine styles, and then gets more specific, describing specific wines: dry white wine; semi-sweet white wine; pink wine; dry red wine; sparkling wine; sweet wine; and fortified wine. While the descriptions of each are brief, they do an excellent job of covering the essentials. <br /> <br />From there the book moves into \\"How to Taste\\", and unlocks the mysteries of what we are supposed to look for in wine. Most people that want to seem like they know what they are doing in arestaurant merely embarrass themselves. For example, they sniff the cork instead of squeezing it, or slush the wine around in the glass when poured for the initial taste as if they are trying to set a speed record. This section tells us how to do it more properly. It also discusses tastes, aromas, flavors, and textures. What is an example of a \\"chewy\\" wine? Cabernet Sauvignon, because it is dry, full bodied, and strong, with a smooth beginning that (if the wine is of good quality) explodes on the palate with perhaps four or five distinct flavors, and then finishes rough. Chewy refers to it being full bodied. Heavy in the mouth. <br /> <br />There is a very instructive and well-organized section on wines by grape type. Each major grape (every grape in the world isn't listed - if it were, it would fill the whole book) is listed, and is characterized with this information: Usual wine style; Intensity; Aromas/Flavors; Acidity; Texture; Tannin; Wood; Foods; Cooking styles; and the Principal Regions that wine is grown in. <br /> <br />The above hardly sounds like something useful to a Sommelier, does it? But that's only the first 30 pages. After that is where the real fun begins. All of the areas of production are covered exhaustively for such a small tome (e.g., the U.S. France, Australia, Argentina, Chile, Italy, Spain, etc.). There is a section on ordering wine in the restaurant, then combing wine with food, and finally how to buy. <br /> <br />I love this book. It is an excellent introduction. <br />	2004-12-13

Sure, Orthanc is less severe in Tolkien's imagination than in Jackson's film, but Orthanc was never intended to be portrayed as an evil fortress? Originally built by Men of Gondor, Orthanc served as an impregnable fortress. In Sindarin, it means `Forked Height', in reference to the four pinnacles of `hard, glossy black stone, welded into a single tower five hundred feet high'\\". It was later deserted as the D&#7913;nedain moved north, and Saruman - ever in need of feeding his ego - took up residence there. For those familiar only with the movies, this drawing might seem like a let down. I hope that I've squared this away somewhat. The movie overdid it. <br /> <br />I have always admired Tolkien, revered him with a sense of awe. He wrote a classic children's novel (The Hobbit) and another less well known children's book, Letters from Father Christmas (which he also illustrated). He wrote one of the most influential novels of the 20th century, The Lord of the Rings, which was not only a remarkable work of literature but spawned an entire genre (and, unfortunately, some rather poor imitators). Beyond that, he wrote remarkable poetry, much of which can be found in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and in The Lays of Beleriand. But wait - there's more. He wrote mythology. Mythology that is to me, at least, more interesting than any existing \\"real\\" mythology. I'm referencing The Silmarillion, of course. As if that isn't enough, Tolkien was an accomplished artist, an Oxford don, translated Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and held various chairs throughout his illustrious scholarly career. (Where in the world did he find the time to do all of this?) <br /> <br />As to the calendar, Rivendell's beauty is captivating; Lothlorien is as it should have appeared in the movie; Fangorn, with its dark, oppressing watercolors is frightening and foreboding, a forest one would be wise to avoid; Helm's deep, while less impressive as a work of art, is unique as it offered Tolkien a visual image from which to work while planning this massive battle; the leaves from the book of Mazarbul were perhaps my favorite inclusion, if for no other reason that it caused me to admire Tolkien even more; Minas Tirith, though unfinished, showed signs of grandeur; and the covers that Tolkien himself drew for the three books are better than any I have seen. The drawing for the Two Towers ends the debate of exactly which towers Tolkien was referring to in the title. He drew Minas Morgul and Orthanc. I think he's the expert on this. <br /> <br />Honestly, I'm not sure why The Brother's Hildebrandt bothered to put out a LOTR calendar. I'm sure it had to do with milking the 50th anniversary for all its worth, and that I haven't seen their names on anything of merit in years until the LOTR movies were being made, but their art doesn't come close to depicting the depths of Tolkien's work. They were best served as artists for The Sword of Shannara - which was derivative and shallow. If you're thinking about which calendar to buy, stop thinking right now. This is the real thing - the other is simply Parkay. <br />	2004-12-13

Such it is with stories like Young Goodman Brown, and The Dead. Conrad's Heart of Darkness is a longer work than these two, but it is considered short. In the book I read it in, it was barely one hundred pages long. <br /> <br />My first reading of Heart of Darkness was rather laborious, likely because I have been readying children's and young adult fantasy for the past year, for unrelated research purposess. Imagine the shock! When I finished reading it, my head was spinning a bit. Without doubt, I recognized that I had finished reading a truly great story, but I was not entirely sure why it was great, so far gone was my brain in it's genre fixation. Therefore, I read it again. <br /> <br />It was my second reading of Heart of Darkness that offered the intense enjoyment of *understanding* the greatness of a thing. It wasn't merely a story of a voyage into the Congo; nay, it was a story of man's inhumanity toward other men, and raised disturbing questions about imperialism (which now, more than 100 years later, we recognize more vividly). <br /> <br />Then there was the simple symbolism. There are two women knitting black wool that seem to hint at the Fates of Greek mythology. What are they knitting? It is most likely the doom of the Africans, while these \\"fates\\" have an uneasy alliance with their gods, The Company. <br /> <br />There is the the use of white and black, so prevalent in the story. Juxtaposed against each other, they showed the ridiculousness of man's perception of black being bad and white being good - for there was nothing good about the Company - as it is a company entirely of Whites. Even the Accountant is immaculately dressed and described as draped in white. <br /> <br />These examples scratch the surface. <br /> <br />It was such a delight to read something again that made me *think*. And I'm eagerly awaiting the third reading, although I want to read a few more stories by Conrad before I do so again. <br /> <br />One reviewer said that friends of his derided him for reading books read in high school. I remember reading The Scarlet Letter, As I Lay Dying, Slaughterhouse Five, The Great Gatsby (and others that aren't coming directly to mind). Are these books not classics of literature because they were read in high school? Rubbish and sophistry. <br />	2004-11-16

It was great fun. I'm not bragging, by the way, as I think it was rather sad that for five years all I did was read The Lord of the Rings over and over again, along with The Hobbit and The Silmarillion. There was much literature that I missed. <br /> <br />This really is a fun little book.There are general questions from the published works: The Hobbit, The Silmarillion, The Adventures of Tom Bombadil, Unfinished Tales, Smith of Wooten Major, and Farmer Giles of Ham. Then there are more specific questions, involving the history of the elves, dwarves, Numenor, Rohan, the life of Tolkien, and many others. It's a short book, but a comprehensive one. If you're a Tolkien fan of any kind, and even if you have no one with which to use this book as a form of Trivia Pursuit, you can play it with yourself to test your knowledge. As it is a short book, it certainly isn't all encompassing. Such a book would be, perhaps, as long as The Lord of the Rings itself. But its summation is excellent, and the questions well picked.	2004-11-14

Every breeder I spoke with acknowledged it as the premier source of information extant for Irish Wolfhounds. (One breeder said they'd never heard of it, and that raised my eye considerably.) <br /> <br />It was worth every last penny, but for the life of me I don't understand why it's not still in print. There isn't a single book on Irish Wolfhounds that stands up to this, and when you compare this book with others, it's similar to comparing an Irish Wolfhound to a gerbil. No comparison. <br /> <br />The pictures are worth a million words. It's often difficult to get an idea of how immense this beautiful and gentle dog truly is, but there are eye turning pictures in this book that make you wonder if it's a dog or a bear. Aside from its enormity, it's also a stunningly beautiful dog (although many consider it wiry and ugly - their loss), and again, the photographs and drawings capture the true essence of this most magnificent dog perfectly. If all you want is a picture book, this is the book for you. However, I wouldn't advise spending $300 on a picture book if that's all you want. Look on the web, there are great photographs of this leonine canine everywhere. <br /> <br />The author covers so many topics, and she does so with a sure, knowledgeable hand. She begins with what it's like to live with Wolfhounds, and that is an important chapter for anyone considering taking this dog into their home. It's not like buying a German Shepherd, or a Labrador, or even a Mastiff. This dog requires *space*, not to mention room to run. Lots of it. <br /> <br />There is an excellent chapter, that was my personal favorite, on the history of the Irish Wolfhound. You'll find many writings on the internet that say this or that about the Wolfhounds ancestry, but this is the authority. <br /> <br />From there forward the book moves from choosing a Wolfhound (companion or show dog?; what color?; first contact with the puppy) to rearing; adult care; feeding; basic training; breed standards; how the different colors are produced; showing the wolfhound; coursing; breeding; whelping a litter; caring for the litter; health care; and finally discussions on Irish Wolfhounds in the UK, Ireland, North America, and worldwide. <br /> <br />If you have a question about an Irish Wolfhound after reading this book, then rethink your question - you're probably asking the wrong question. It's all here, and it's as magnificent as the dog itself. <br />	2004-11-12

I hadn't heard of several of the dogs contained herein, and it was very interesting to see what they look like and read about their history and gameness.    I learned quite a bit about gameness, and the inappropriately labeled \\"sport\\" of dogfighting, although this book DOES NOT (nor do I) support or promote dogfighting. I also learned that Dr. Semencic really likes the American Pit Bull Terrier - as it is the gamest of all breeds.    For someone who didn't know very much about the so-called fighting dogs going in, this was an excellent introduction. The information was accessible, and pictures contained within were helpful in getting a good feel for each dog that was discussed.	2004-11-12

While there's more information about each breed, there aren't many new breeds. I count the Jindo, the Canary Dog, and the South African Boerboel. I'm not sure that this necessitated a new book, but when I'm looking for information I turn to this book instead of The World of Fighting Dogs since, as I noted, it does contain more information. <br /> <br />Once again, the photographs are excellent, and I'm glad that Dr. Semencic went to the trouble of pulling so many photos together. These dogs are truly beautiful examples of their breed.	2004-11-12

To be certain, that book had periods of brilliance, such as the occurrences in Andelain, but all in all it was probably the weakest book in the series. (That doesn't mean it isn't good - just that the rest of the books are incredible.) <br /> <br />In The Illearth War Covenant is called back to the Land for a second time, and his image of a reluctant hero is burnished in our mind even more than it was in the previous book, for while he was being summoned he was also on the phone with his ex-wife, Joan. The woman who left him for fear of his leprosy, the woman with whom he was still in love, the woman who was telling him, right then, that she missed and needed him. So he protests his summoning vehemently, but to no avail. As the new High Lord Elena indicates, they have no knowledge of how to send a person back once a summons is complete. <br /> <br />The Council of Lords has some new faces on it. It's been forty years since Covenant has been to the Land, and seven years (seven \\"Land\\" years) remain until the fulfillment of Foul's ominous prophecy from Lord Foul's Bane. The Lords are desperate. While they regained the Staff of Law and found High Lord Kevin's Second Ward at the end of Lord Foul's Bane, they have learned very little. The language, they find, is difficult to penetrate, and they find themselves unequal to the task of mastering the lore. Due to their sense of overwhelming failure and inadequacy, and other baleful events, they make the decision to summon Covenant. <br /> <br />There is another addition to Revelstone: Hile Troy. He is a character from the \\"real world\\", someone who has read (or had read to him) Covenant's best selling novel. This is, perhaps, Donaldson's way of telling us that Covenant's experiences most definitely is not a dream (which Covenant is still convincing himself of). He's also blind, and unlike Covenant - who maintains fierce unbelief - Troy believes in the Land with a passion that precludes life. <br /> <br />Many readers interpret Troy's character as what Covenant *should* be. If Hile Troy had a white gold ring, his passion, his love for the land (for it allowed him to see again - and besides, everyone, even the readers, fall in love with the Land) would lead him directly to a confrontation to Foul. Unfortunately, not understanding the dilemmas of power, he would likely experience a resounding defeat. What people don't understand about Covenant, and Troy's character is supposed to help them understand this, is that Covenant's stubborn unbelief exists for a reason. In Lord Foul's Bane, Donaldson meticulously discussed the rigors of leprosy, what it meant to be a leper, what it meant to *survive* as a leper. And though bitter and angry at life and everything around him - or perhaps because of his bitterness - Covenant made the decision to live. And living entails never, ever letting your guard drop for one second. Because if you do, you can bump into something, not realize that you're bleeding internally, and die of hemorrhaging; gangrene can set in; and much more. So Covenant's unbelief, while incredibly frustrating, is completely understandable. He needs to believe that the Land isn't real, because if he gives in to it, then when he wakes up from his dream (for it may be a dream), his guard may drop, and he could die. <br /> <br />So it's unfortunate that people don't recognize Troy for what he is, and see him for exactly the opposite of what Donaldson intended. <br /> <br />Other reviewers have said this is the best book in the series. I love this book, as it introduces some extremely intriguing relationships and concepts (Elena and Amok, the latter of which is the key to High Lord Kevin's Seventh Ward - talk about heightened anticipation), and the devastating fear that Foul has mastered the Illearth Stone to such a degree that he can cut chips off of it and give it to his servants (Ravers). <br/> <br />The battle of Garrotting Deep (yes, similar in placement and scope to the epic Battle of Helm's Deep in The Two Towers) shows that Donaldson, like Tolkien before him, can write both of beauty and of beauty's absence in the heart of darkness of war. He is quite adept at handling battle scenes. <br /> <br />Many second books suffer from the so-called sophomore slump. Not this one. I don't think Donaldson is capable of writing such a book, as The One Tree (the second book in The Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant) is arguably the most intriguing of the series, and within that book in particular are the seeds for the Last Chronicles, which everyone - and I mean everyone - should read. <br />	2004-11-11
US	50510246	R3W1CZTFSH6VB8	0060280921	703135449	Abarat	Books	4	38	42	N	N	Much unresolved, but a fantastic read	Abarat certainly is an amazing creation. <br /> <br />While reading the book, I was swept away by the brilliance of the dark and powerful artwork that Barker created. The interior art gave the book a texture and feeling that it would have lacked otherwise, much like John R. Neill's artwork added layers to Baum's (and others) Oz books. <br /> <br />Candy Quackenbush is a fairly normal, average girl. I was pleased to see this, because far too often we find authors creating unfashionable, socially inept, or withdrawn characters that they want us to feel sympathy for. There's a good reason that many authors seek to do that - there's *nothing* like rooting for the underdog. Granted, there is a scene of embarrassment in the very beginning of the book, but Candy's reaction to the embarrassment isn't to go off and cry about it - she takes matters into her own hands. So what we are left with is feeling proud of her, and that is what authors should strive for. The characters on the page need to create some form of powerful emotion within us, and it doesn't always need to be pity. <br /> <br />Her own hands - and her feet - lead her to a field with a dilapidated lighthouse where she meets one of the most original and odd characters I've ever come across in children's, young adult, or adult fantasy - the John brothers. And then immediately the story kicks into overdrive, as Mendelson Shape, a creature out of nightmares, assails them, looking to retrieve something that the John brothers have stolen. Through an act of heroism, Candy calls a sea to the plains of Minnesota - the Sea of Izabella, and the sea transports her and the John brothers to the Abarat, an astonishing archipelago of dizzying diversity. <br /> <br />Candy's encounters in the sea, and her immediate encounters on reaching Abarat, make for rapid page turning. There is simply so much to see, so much that is different than any experience we have come upon before. <br /> <br />But then the story slows down, and becomes, for far too long, a tour of Abarat and an introduction to fanciful creatures. There is absolutely no question that Abarat is an invention to be marveled at, and that the fanciful creatures possess highly unique qualities that are entertaining, but it's simply too much, and there isn't much happening other than a game of bait and chase. Candy has caught the eye of Christopher Carrion - who serves as the Dark Lord of this series, though there are other enemies - and he wants the item that the John brothers stole (and gave to Candy for safekeeping) and Candy herself. He has an odd sensation that he has seen her before, and gradually becomes obsessed with her. <br /> <br />I believe that books should have distinguishable plot and character arcs, and that the ending of a book should complete all of the various arcs. Abarat left quite a bit up for grabs. There wasn't much of an ending - only a wrap up in the final chapter to prepare us for the next book, and while it should be obvious from all of the groundwork laid in Abarat that there is a wild and exciting adventure ahead, nothing was resolved. <br /> <br />One might argue that the first two books of The Lord of the Rings had no discernible ending, and no arcs were resolved. However, that book was written as one book. The publisher, for various reasons, decided to cut the book into three - forever cementing into the minds of those who read fantasy the concept of the need of a trilogy to make something complete, for better or worse. Abarat isn't like The Fellowship of the Ring or The Two Towers. It is supposed to be a stand alone book, and instead it seems more like an extended prologue. <br /> <br />That aside, this was one heck of a story. I'm not going to fault Barker too much for not tidying up before he moved on to the second book. The real test will be the second book - if it lives up to this rather overwhelming creation. We'll see. <br /> <br />The artwork, the sense of closeness to the events as they occurred, and the uniqueness of Abarat make this a four star review. Normally books that don't resolve arcs get lower marks from me, but in the end I was so impressed with Barker's creation that I found that deviation forgiveable. <br />	2004-11-09
US	50510246	R2H2V2Y14VGKKQ	0439456959	163376703	Dragon Rider	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Excellent adventure for its intended age group	While reading this book I forced myself into the mind of a fourth grader, and when you're thirty-eight year old, that can be difficult. What helped me was remembering the books that I was reading at the time, and what stuck out the most was Baum's Oz series. I read and reread and re-reread and re-re-reread all fourteen of the Oz books so many times that my mother actually told me to stop checking them out of the library. But I couldn't help myself. In my opinion, there was nothing better, nothing that evoked the sense of amazement and wonder that Baum's books did. <br /> <br />Fixed on that, I found myself in a perfect position to read and enjoy this book. And I enjoyed it tremendously. In fact, I have a difficult time believing that anyone within the age range that this book was intended for, and who likes fantasy, would not like it because it has all of the elements of magic that a children's fantasy needs. I'm quite certain that if this book had been around when I finished with the Oz books that I would have eaten this up as quickly as I had consumed Baum's works, and perhaps even read, re-read - OK, you get the picture. <br /> <br />It contains so-called \\"fabulous\\" creatures, and defines them in unique and appealing ways: dragons who require moonlight for energy and don't ravage villages for food (all but one of them, at any rate); mountain dwarves whose powers lie within their hats and who can smell silver or gold; brownies who practically obsess over the eating and cultivation of mushrooms and for whom spit has magical properties; a homunculus created by a fourteenth century alchemist who speaks 93 languages (what else would you do if you were 700 years old other than spend most of that time learning); talking rats; and many more. Every one that you meet has its stereotype redefined with at least a tiny tweak so that it doesn't seem as if you are merely reading a book about creatures who already know. I think tweaking the stereotypical definitions was a terrific idea. <br /> <br />Then there's the quest itself. The dragons are being displaced from their home. One of them, Firedrake, offers to leave and search for the legendary Rim of Heavens where other dragons are rumored to live, and which is rumored to be beautiful beyond metaphor. To get there, the questers receive a map from a rat, who is a master cartographer, and this map is included (partially) in the book itself as a full color foldout which gives the book an added appeal. <br /> <br />The adventures of the questers, the questions of loyalties that arise, the manner in which issues of morality are handled all make for exciting reading. Not to mention their pursuer, who is also a dragon but of a very different kind than Firedrake. The writing of that particular character was deftly done, and that in itself is an achievement. It isn't often that the \\"lead\\" antagonist can be put on every page and not cause the story to lose any of its immediacy. <br /> <br />My only wish is that a little more time had been given to describing these fabulous creatures. When I think of a dragon, I immediately (like many adults who read fantasy) think of Smaug, from Tolkien's masterpiece The Hobbit. Or of any number of films and books where the dragon is so much bigger than humans. I didn't really get a grasp of how large this dragon was (or wasn't) until I was deep into the book. Since the author went against stereotypes (for example, who would have thought that a brownie looked similar to a cat?), I think this was an essential piece that was missing. <br /> <br />In any event, that's the worst I can say for this. Reading this strictly as an adult, I would give this three and half, maybe four stars. But reading it as a fourth, fifth, or sixth grader, I can't give it any less than 5. It is truly an excellent book for this age group. If you're a parent teetering on whether or not to buy it, do so. You won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />One other thing: this book was only published here in America now because of the success of Eragon. It was first published in Germany in 1997 - before even Harry Potter hit the stands. Don't blame the author for copying, as she most certainly is not. Her publisher merely thought that a book about a dragon and a rider would sell particularly well in today's \\"climate\\", and they were right. <br />	2004-11-01

Such it must have been when children first read the Wizard of Oz in 1900, almost exactly 100 years before Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone would be published. The popularity of The Wizard of Oz was unheard of for the time - a children's book selling so many copies, engendering so many fans, children and adults alike. That book paved the way for thousands of writers after.<br /><br />Such it also was when children read The Hobbit in 1937 (indeed, its popularity was so great that it demanded a sequel - unarguably the greatest sequel in fantasy literature), and The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe in 1950.<br /><br />While I was seventy-odd years removed The Wizard of Oz when I first read it, forty-odd years from the Hobbit, and 20-odd years from The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, after reading each, they created within me a hunger, a desire for more that seemed unquenchable.<br /><br />For me...such it was when I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone - thankfully only a month or so removed from its actual publication date. I say thankfully because now I saw, for the first time, the excitement that a timeless book of children's literature creates.<br /><br />And this book is timeless. While it's now five years since from the publication of the book, I can say with certainty that when I closed the cover of this book, I knew it. I knew that something amazing had happened, and I watched in mute astonishment as the rest of the literate world agreed with me.<br /><br />What a tale this is!

Upon reaching the portion of the book where the backstory was told (think of Frodo arriving at Rivendell and everyone sharing their stories, particularly Gandalf), I became hooked. Many of the questions I had amassed during the pages prior to this were answered, as well as ones I didn't know that I had. It's a testimony to the author's inventiveness that he held my attention from the moment the mythos was being explained until it was over. What makes it more impressive is that this took roughly forty-five pages. <br /> <br />The problem is that I almost didn't get there. The first chapter was a great hook, with time stopping and all, but I grew wary when inconsistencies started popping up, and I felt that certain portions of the text should have come before others and so on...and then UFOs entered the picture. I had some difficulty with Sumerian artifacts, magic books, and UFOs being in the same picture, but, like I said, all of that was answered during the explanation referenced above. Also, italics are used far too often. One uses italics to emphasize, but when they're overused, they lose their emphasis and begin to blend in with everything else on the page. The tyranny of italics... <br /> <br />I believe that there is a great story here, that the author has a tremendous, inventive imagination (frankly, the concepts often left me speechless), and that what separates this book from \\"good\\" and \\"excellent\\" (i.e., 3 or 5 stars) is a competent editor. Books that include time travel are very difficult to plan, organize, plot, and ultimately write. <br /> <br />One other thing: I thought the book ended stronger than it began (with the exception of the first chapter). <br /> <br />And in a second book, which is not so casually hinted at, I'd like to see the characters resolving their conflicts instead of relyingon a god-like character which is, essentially, an adult. There's nothing wrong with strong adult presences in young adult literature, but the young adults in the book should be a bit more involved, in my opinion. <br /> <br />Still, I want to emphasize that this is *not* a negative review. Three stars, in my rating system, is \\"good\\"; therefore, this is a positive review. There's good material here, I just think with some tightening it could be even better. And personally, I'm looking forward to the follow-up to this book. <br /> <br />	2004-10-26

This has been a rich source of English vocabulary, contributing through different channels such a varied assortment as prehensile, prison, and prize 'something seized in war', not to mention prefixed forms like apprehend, comprehend, comprise, impgregnable, reprehensible, reprieve, and surprise. It is also the ancestor of French prendre 'take'.<br /><br />Here's the Oxford Dictionary of Word Histories entry for the same word:<br /><br />PREY [Middle English] Early noun use included the sense 'plunder taken in war' (=that which is 'seized'); it comes from Old French preie, from Latin praeda 'boot'.

First is the Oxford entry, second is Ayto's. <br /> <br />PREY [Middle English] Early noun use included the sense 'plunder taken in war' (=that which is 'seized'); it comes from Old French preie, from Latin praeda 'boot'. The verb is from Old French preir, based on Latin praedari 'seize as plunder', from praeda. The verbal phrase prey upon is found from early times. <br /> <br />---- <br /> <br />PREY Prey comes via Old French prei from Latin praeda 'booty' (from which was derived the word paredari 'plunder', source of English depradation and predatory). This was a contraction of an earlier praeheda, a noun formed with the prefix prae-'before' from the same base (*hed- 'saize', source also of English get) as produced the verb praehendere 'seize'. This has been a rich source of English vocabulary, contributing through different channels such a varied assortment as prehensile, prison, and prize 'something seized in war', not to mention prefixed forms like apprehend, comprehend, comprise, impgregnable, reprehensible, reprieve, and surprise. It is also the ancestor of French prendre 'take'. <br /> <br />Both are complete entries, but one is obviously more complete than the other. <br />	2004-10-23

I brought a considerable amount of bias to this story; after all, it has been hailed as the greatest ghost story ever written by so many literary critics, and it is difficult to set aside such prophesies of adulation. <br /> <br />I wasn't terribly disappointed. <br /> <br />Henry James has a style of writing that doesn't appeal to everyone. Certainly not to people expecting fast paced thrillers written by Dan Brown, or horror glock by Stephen King. His style is slow, psychological, in some places almost operatic. But there were strong points and weak points, and those are clearly delineated here. The introduction is fabulously alive and sparkles with tension, as do all of the sequences where characters interact with each other. When we are left alone in the mind of the governess, who is either a prescient seer or a hopeless neurotic, the immediacy of the writing slows considerably. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, we are in the mind of the governess for the majority of the story. <br /> <br />Still, it's a fascinating tale, rife with subtlety and passion, and considerable suspense. What did the young master do at school that caused him to be sent home, when he appears to be such a perfect angel? What is the nature of the apparitions the governess sees? What affect, if any, do these apparitions have on the two children in her care? <br /> <br />The ending itself is ingenious, and quite a shock. It answers many questions, but leaves just as many unanswered. You'll need to connect the dots yourselves, for James doesn't give much away. <br />	2004-10-23

Is it possible that there are worse villains in the world than Count Olaf and his eerie girlfriend, Esme Squalor, and they might be working in cahoots with Olaf? Is it possible, as has been hinted since The Hostile Hospital, that someone else survived \\"the fire\\"? Can Violet fall in love? Can Sunny fashion meals out of seemingly incompatible ingredients? Are we to be introduced to the absolute worst scouting pledge of all time? Could they have finally found the headquarters for VFD, whatever that stands for? <br /> <br />To answer: yes, perhaps, yes, yes, yes, and I won't tell you. <br /> <br />We encounter more VFDs here: Very Fascinating Drama; Very Fun Day; Vinegar-Flavored Doughnuts; Violent Frozen Dragonflies; Voracious Fierce Dragon; Vain Fat Dictator; Vernacularly Fastened Door; Vertical Flame Diversion; Verdant Flammable Device; and Volunteer Feline Detective, amongst others. We also encounter a most odiferous young girl who fashions herself the False Spring Queen of the Snow Scouts at this particular juncture - Carmelita Spats - whom I have always envisioned as that large brute of a girl that used to beat up on Lisa Simpson. As horrid as she is, it is fun to have the word \\"cakesniffer\\" bandied around again. <br /> <br />Sunny has really beefed up her skills as a chef. Having been abducted by Count Olaf, she is separated from her siblings and has been forced into performing chores for Count Olaf that are nearly impossible for a child her age. Not to mention that every night, at the top of a very cold mountain, she is forced to sleep in a casserole dish! Sunny's culinary abilities are beginning to blossom. One of the many creative dishes she fashions out of the seemingly incompatible ingredients that the filthy Olaf has left in the even filthier trunk of his automobile is Lox. To prepare Lox, one most have the appropriate accoutrements - or so says Snicket, in a rare misuse of a word. Accoutrements have more to do with apparel than ingredients in food, but with a stretch of the imagination, it's not difficult to forgive. Anyway, Sunny somehow finds \\"bagels, cream cheese, sliced cucumber, black pepper, and capers\\". She's also lucky enough to have salmon at her disposal, and she smokes this in preparation for making the Lox. (Not smoke in the sense of smoking a cigarette of course, or a Verdant Flammable Device,                                                    but smoke in the sense of sending out distress signals to her siblings!) <br /> <br />A common element amongst all of these wonderfully morose yet uplifting books is triumph over adversity due to teamwork, and it is never used more than it is here. I'd love to comment on how, but that would give some things away that readers who aren't familiar with the books wouldn't want me to give away. <br /> <br />Suffice to say, this is one of the strongest books in the series, and is also the longest. I admit to being sufficiently concerned that Book the Eleventh would be even longer (following a disturbing trend in today's publishing industry) but that wasn't the case. <br />	2004-10-19

Donaldson's Chronicles of Thomas Covenant: Variations on the Fantasy Tradition	Books	5	10	11	N	N	Excellent review of Donaldson's work	As a fan of Donaldson's Covenant series, I was delighted to see that there was a scholarly work of literary criticism covering the Chronicles. There have been so many written about The Lord of the Rings (deservedly so) but none regarding Covenant. I felt this was a mistake, as Donaldson's works, while certainly not equal to Tolkien's, bear significant literary merit. <br /> <br />One of the things I found most interesting was the shared vocabulary between Senior and Donaldson. Any reader of Donaldson knows that he enjoys employing archaic words. Senior even levies this as somewhat of a criticism. However, *he uses some of the same words*. I couldn't help but chuckle. To argue for clarity, and then go against your own argument is, well, silly. <br /> <br />But that's the worst I can say about the book. Other than works on literary criticism regarding Tolkien, this was one of the very few that I read from cover to cover. He didn't miss many points (although as others have pointed out there were some factual innaccuries; these were minor, though). <br /> <br />Here are some chapter titles, to give you an idea of what's in the book: <br /> <br />1. Modern Fantasy and Stephen R. Donaldson <br />2. 2. Thomas Covenant: Leper as Hero <br />3. Donaldson and Tolkien (great chapter) <br />4. Myth <br />5. Narrative, Structure, and Knowledge <br />6. Life and Death <br />7. The Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant: \\"To Bear What Must Be Borne\\". <br /> <br />There are also two rather extensive interviews, which for those Covenant fans who don't participate in the \\"gradual interview\\" on [...] or who don't follow the bulletin boards on [...] offer much needed insight into the mind of an author who is much more complex than he seems to the casual observer. <br />	2004-10-19

One would think that this is inherently a bad thing. However, given where they are going, and the disguises they find in the trunk, it actually becomes a good thing (as do most bad things in these stories...every failure is usually offset by a delightful rebound). <br /> <br />They find themselves at the Caligari Carnival, run by Madame Lulu, who speaks in that odd halting, accented tone that Olaf did in The Ersatz Elevator. They eavesdrop on Count Olaf while he's receiving advice from the Madame Lulu, who has a crystal ball (what would a carnival be without a crystal ball?). The Baudelaire's decide that they need to remain close to what is happening here, and they don some of the disguises they came across and apply for jobs as freaks at the carnival. Sunny puts on the beard that Count Olaf wore while pretending to be Stephano in The Reptile Room, and becomes Chabo the wolf baby, half wolf, half human. Klaus and Violet drape a large shirt over themselves, pretending to have two heads, and while auditioning for their parts in the freak show at the Carnival, they are asked to eat an ear of corn, at which they fail miserably. For reasons only they can understand, Olaf's hench-fools think that's hysterical, and with Chabo's growling (a riot in themselves) they get the job. Hysterically, Klaus and Violet's \\"job\\" is to eat an ear of corn together, as crowds love \\"sloppy eating\\". <br /> <br />Snicket often makes social and/or political commentary that sometimes is rather well hidden, and at other times, such as in this book, is quite blatant. When the Baudelaire's are shown to their hammocks in the freak caravan, we realize that he's being blatant here. Amongst the freaks are a hunchback, a contortionist, and an ambidextrous man who is shamed at his agility. These really aren't freaks at all, especially not Kevin. Ambidexterity is a gift!! <br /> <br />Events transpire, and the Baudelaire's learn a terrible secret about Madame Lulu. This secret also gives them further insight into V.F.D.; however, Count Olaf has brought some lions to the Carnival, and it is decided that the freaks will be fed to the lions! This is surely a situation that the Baudelaire's cannot possibly escape. <br /> <br />All of the elements that make these books such a wonder are in full force here, and  Sunny beginning to learn a skill of her own. Violet is an inventor, Klaus a researcher, and it seems that Sunny has some inherent abilities toward constructing recipes. <br /> <br />But are these skills, even Sunny's newfound abilities as a chef, enough to escape man eating lions?? <br />	2004-10-19

They are lucky (?) to come across a hospital by way of joining up with a troop of happy-go-luckers who sing ridiculous songs and would rather give sick and dying people a heart shaped balloon than penicillin, call themselves, \\"Volunteers Fighting Disease\\". First it was the Village of Fowl Devotees, now we have Volunteers Fighting Disease. More confusion reigns for the Baudelaire's as they try and figure out exactly what the meaning is of coming across multiple VFD's. <br /> <br />Once inside the hospital, they are immediately put to work in the Library of Records, which, for an unfathomable and unexplained reason contains the type of information that should be in a real library, not filing cabinets in a hospital. Their job at first seems tedious, because the filing system is, to be kind, a debacle. Information on turtles might be filed under \\"T\\" for turtles, or it might be filed under \\"S\\" for reptiles with shells on their back, or perhaps \\"I\\" for infuriatingly slow creatures. Or, perhaps \\"R\\" for reptiles! Is your mind dizzy? Mine is. <br /> <br />But their work in this library is not for naught. They come across something called The Snicket File, and while the contents have been mostly removed, just enough remains to offer them some unlooked for hope. <br /> <br />Unfortunately - and isn't this a sad descriptor that comes up in most reviews of the Baudelaire's adventures? - tragedy (another sad descriptor) strikes. Violet is captured and is scheduled for a cranioectomy, which really isn't a valid medical procedure. You see, cranio-, in medical terms, refers to the cranium, which isthe skull. And -ectomy refers to the removal of an anatomical structure. So a cranioectomy is the removal of a person's skull! This is obviously not a good thing. <br /> <br />It is left to Klaus and Sunny to figure out a means by which to save their sister, and the manner in which they attempt do so is, as appropriate for Snicket, hysterical. <br /> <br />Sadly (there we go with depressing descriptors again), a terrible tragedy befalls the hospital - but an even more terrible tragedy befalls the Baudelaires. <br />	2004-10-19

If you wear unwieldy, unfashionable (whether it's in or out) and revoltingly ugly hats, you have to be burned at the stake. Sound ridiculous? Not in this book. <br /> <br />Here the poor Baudelaire's are placed with the Village of Fowl Devotees, and when they learn the name of the village, they hope that perhaps they might get some answers to VFD. Mr. Poe is operating here under the aphorism, \\"It takes a village to raise a child\\", but as usual he's completely off base and out of touch with reality, because the village he's sending these kids to is, well, if I were to pay them a compliment, off-kilter. <br /> <br />For example, the RULES. They are absurd, but absurd in a hysterical fashion that leaves you laughing and wanting to hear what the next pointless rule is.  <br /> <br />\\"Rule #920 clearly states that no one may talk while on the platform [at the council of elders] unless you are a police officer.\\" To further enforce this point, an elder states: \\"You're orphans, not police officers, so shut up.\\" <br /> <br />Rule #19,833 \\"states that no villains are allowed within the city limits. <br /> <br />Rule # 67 \\"clearly states that no citizen is allowed to build or use any mechanical devices.\\" Poor Violet!! <br /> <br />Those are only a few, but here's the worst part of it all: the punishment for breaking any of these rules, regardless of the rule, is to be burned at the stake! <br /> <br />We learn things in this book, as usual, such as the migratory patterns of crows. There is a Neverland Tree, and a fountain shaped like a fish. There is also, I'm sorry to say, the appearance of some people who break Rule #19,833, but due to \\"mob rule\\", those people convince the village elders that the real villains are the Baudelaires, and they face the most ignoble, not to mention terrifying and life threatening, likelihood of being burned at the stake. <br /> <br />Creativity abounds, especially in the form of the lost Quagmire triplets. But I'll zip it and say no further on that. <br /> <br />There are lots of surprises in this book, and it was an example of the books just getting better and better. As I have stated in other reviews, The Miserable Mill was a bit of a low point for the series, but after that it is picked up with the energy of a locomotive, if not that of Superman, and is barreling straight ahead. <br />	2004-10-19
US	50510246	R2IQ756YUNKCXP	0974029092	492528729	1: Silverlance	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Good first book	Silverlance is a good first book, but as with all first endeavors, there is room to grow here. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the different races that you don't find as common characters in fantasy: the centaurs, satyrs, griffins, and dryads. Normally you find them as backdrop characters. Also refreshing was that, as another reviewer has pointed out, the main character had no real power of his own. I would add that what the main character did have was a pure heart, and this empowered his quest. <br /> <br />But I thought the quest could have started out on more believable footing. When Byron initially left to follow the star, I was searching for motivation, and didn't find any. I'm not talking chapters or even paragraphs of motivation - just a little more than, \\"I see a star and I want to follow it.\\" The same goes for most of the others that, along the way, joined Byron's quest. I was also very confused by Ravinath's insistence that Byron not go. That gets answered later in the book, but a little too late for my taste. I won't say what we learn about Ravinath, so as not to give anything away, but what we did learn we should have known (because Byron knew) long before we were told. <br /> <br />Another reviewer thought there could have been less action and more character development. I agree with that assessment wholeheartedly. What I don't agree with, though, was that descriptions were very clear, to the point of feeling that you were right there. More than once I found myself looking back and scratching my head to try and get a better image of what was happening, from descriptions of people and animals to events - and too often even going back and re-reading didn't satisfy my need for clarity. An example of a scene that could have used more refined description involves their encounter with the Minotaur. He is partly described as \\"the biggest wildest bull that ever was...\\" Well, how big is that? As big as Paul Bunyan's blue ox? Or just maybe one and a half times the size ofa normal bull? I need to *see* that, because that Minotaur is described as fairly omnipotent in the situation it is in, but then...something happens...and in order for me to fully buy into what happens, I need to know more about the Minotaur.  <br /> <br />Also, I felt that there were too many very powerful creatures/beings assisting the essentially powerless questers, and too often things seemed to just happen because they happened - not because they were necessary or germane to the world or the story. <br /> <br />The backstory was very strong; the author obviously spent a fair amount of time world building, and it showed. However, I would have liked the backstory to have been introduced a bit earlier in the story, so that I could know what's at stake. Knowing what's at stake is the most important element to get across in a fantasy, and while we knew a little, we didn't know enough. <br /> <br />There *were* similarities to Tolkien. A reference to a shadow that lives under a mountain that is mined by dwarves...and a dwarf saying \\"I can go and go, just not very fast\\" is straight out of The Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br />None of what I mentioned above is unforgivable, however, and this is *not* a negative review. I hope it is a helpful review. Like I said, this is a good first book. All writers make mistakes their first time out; what separates good writers from everyone else is the ability to recognize their mistakes and correct them. All in all, I think that this is a story with a good foundation, and that the author possesses the skills to grow. There is to be a second book, according to the author's website. Hopefully that book is a bit tighter - dare I say edited with a comb that has finer teeth. I'd like to see that book, to see how far the author can grow as a writer. <br /> <br />I wish him the best of luck. <br />	2004-10-18

Menace in the Walls has all of the above. <br /> <br />Joshua Keegan is very eager to work in a hospital, and he jumps at the offer to work in Dr. Channing's lab for the summer. Prior to starting his job in the lab, he helped his mother one night during a terrible storm and was surprised to see that several children were being brought to the emergency room with the same symptoms: nosebleeds, coughing, congestion, and X-Rays that reveal damaged lungs. As Joshua begins his job in the lab, part of his duties involve entering patient information into the computer. As he's doing so, he notices that eight children, all under the age of four months, and all from the same area that experienced the flooding during the storm, have large X's over their data. Finding this odd, he prints out the information. <br /> <br />Later he learns that his favorite horse died - from mold that it ate in its hay. Doing some quick research on the internet, he discovers a disturbing link between the infants that were brought in during the storm and his horse's death. Thus begins the intrigue, and the mystery that Joshua sets out to solve. And it is an exciting, page-turning story that I found most enjoyable. <br /> <br />Along the way he finds unexpected help from a school jock and, perhaps even more surprising, his younger sister, whom he thought of as a nuisance in the beginning of the book. Working together, they work better than working alone. <br /> <br />Joshua's character in particular was very impressively fleshed out for such a relatively short book. With the exception of one \\"villain\\", in fact, there really weren't any typical caricatures that you expect to see in children's books. These were all very real characters. <br /> <br />But I think my favorite part of the book was learning about micropipettetips and autoclaving. Reading without learning, regardless of how exciting the story (and this is an exciting story) is like eating mashed potatoes without salt and butter, or gravy, or whatever you like to put on them. It's just not the same. <br />	2004-10-16

Magnifying glasses take photographs; adequate quantities of peanut butter shot with a  bow and plunger (as opposed to a bow and arrow) can silence a siren; a shower curtain, lantern, and picnic basket can become a hot air balloon; and a single purse can carry the luggage of Aunt Puff, Alexandra, Ludwig (the harlequin Great Dane), and Minerva. It is a whimsical and fantastic world, much like a combination of Oz and the sillier parts of Harry Potter (although I stress it is not an imitator of either). These are truly unique creations, and they are hysterically well presented. <br /> <br />The story begins quickly, and the pace doesn't let up for a moment. When Minerva arrives at Puff's house, she is kidnapped within moments of her arrival. Minerva is quite a sight to behold. She stands four feet tall, has a red hair that is a foot high, and wears a leopard-print cowboy hat precariously on top of her plumage. <br /> <br />As Aunt Puff and her niece, Alexandra, search for Minerva, Alexandra (who is really the central character of the book), learns more about her mysterious aunt and the secretive Elcarim Foundation, which seems to have quite a bit to do with miracles. When Aunt Puff herself is kidnapped, Alexandra has to look deep within her, and also overcome enormous and mostly self-inflicted self doubt, to save both of them. If not, Puff and Minerva may be lost forever to the darkened heart of Puff's and Minerva's former friend Dragonus, and the evil of Malrot. <br /> <br />There are almost two parts of the book: the first part, where AuntPuff and Alexandra are working together; and the ending, where Alexandra is on her own. When Aunt Puff is around, the story has a more whimsical feel to it; when she isn't, Yeats is quoted, and the writing turns serious. It is the latter that I feel is the strongest writing in the book, even though I thoroughly enjoyed the fanciful creations mentioned in the first paragraph of this review. If there are further adventures of Aunt Puff and Alexandra, I'd like to see a more of the seriousness spread throughout the entire book - again, only because that was the writing that I personally felt was the strongest. A combination of the two could only result in an even better book. <br /> <br />I'm anxious to learn more about the Elcarim Foundation, and their role in miracles, as we caught a short but beautiful glimpse of it at the end of the book. I do hope more is to come. <br />	2004-10-16

First, let me say: Bravo! Well done, Mr. Donaldson!    Next, I want to direct my comments to those readers who have never read any of the Covenant books, but are contemplating reading this book. Your main concern, undoubtedly, is, \\"How can I possibly enter a complex series at book seven? Won't I be so incredibly lost that it won't make any sense for me to buy this book and see what all the fuss is about Covenant?\\" Both questions are easily answered. Donaldson has taken extraordinary care to construct the beginning of this book in such a way that if you are entering the Covenant series at this late point, by the time you get to page 200, all that went before will be explained, and you'll (almost) feel as if you have read the first six books. He does this primarily in two ways. First, he has written a \\"What Has Gone Before\\" prelude, which succinctly wraps up the essential plots and dilemmas of the first six books into about eight pages. It is *superbly* done. Second, from almost the very beginning of the book itself, he meticulously and purposefully takes the reader back to prior events in the last two trilogies, while at the same time moving the story forward with the tremendous urgency of his past works. While someone like myself (who is probably more familiar with these books than I should be), can see what's happening as plainly as I can see that Shaquille O'Neal is a very large man, people less familiar with the work will not feel burdened or bludgeoned by what is, essentially, catching readers up. For reader like me, this will likely feel somewhat tedious as we know all of the legends of the Land. But for readers who are unfamiliar with the legends, you will find them to be like a drink from the source of a mountain spring. The stories and legends of the Land are as tantalizing, exciting, and wondrous as the story itself.    So - new readers to Covenant, feel safe. Whereas you couldn't jump into Book 7 of Jordan's Wheel of Time series, you can jump into the seventh book of this series. You will not be disappointed.    And now to the book. There is a wonderfully written 77-page \\"Prologue\\", which details the events that take place in the \\"real world\\", the events which lead to Linden and, perhaps others, to be conveyed to The Land. I read this in astonishment. I've read everything that Donaldson has ever written, and this was his best piece of writing. It was like reading Henry James. His descriptions were immaculately clear, the kind of descriptions that distinguish good writing from bad; the kind of descriptive writing that allows the reader to touch, feel, hear, see, and smell; the kind of writing that separates truly great writing from mediocre writing (which, sadly, accounts for about 90% of what's being published today, regardless of genre).    When we arrive in The Land, the threat is less clear than it was in the previous Chronicles. In the first, Lord Foul laid it out to Covenant in no uncertain terms - he was going to destroy The Land, destroy The Lords, and he stopped just short at telling him how he was going to do it, so great was his confidence. Foul's approach was distinctly Hitlerian, his tactics a blitzkrieg in every way. In the second, his attack was more insidious and subtle, but still devastating. Here he attacked nature, Earthpower; the Sunbane was a blight that all could see and feel, and the millions of readers who had fallen in love with the stunning beauty and tangible health of The Land in the First Chronicles couldn't help but to weep at the devastation. In the Last Chronicles, the threat is palpable, it is significant, and it is devastating (not to mention terribly creative). The difference is, the threat isn't only Foul. As we delve deeper into the book, and learn some of the secrets therein, we come to realize that The Land has more than one enemy, with perhaps a different agenda than Foul, and only one true defender with any estimable might: Linden Avery, The Chosen.    It is a testament to Donaldson's mastery of The Land that an entire book can be written in a series titled, \\"The Last Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\", and not have Thomas Covenant in the book for more than ten seconds, and still have that book turn out to be a revelation. In other reviews of sequels, I have been critical, stating that they don't make sense - they don't follow logically from the prior book, or series. (For example, anything by Goodkind; The Mallorean by Eddings; Shannara.) I can't be similarly critical of Donaldson. His sequels follow a perfect logic flow. The Sunbane was *absolutely* what Foul would have done after spending three and half millennia licking his wounds, and while we don't know Foul's full intentions yet, the events that occur within The Runes of the Earth are exactly what they should be, considering the events of the First and Second Chronicles. Donaldson is not writing this to make money, although he is certain to make truckloads of it. He's writing this because he had a vision of how to complete the \\"Covenant cycle\\", and waited twenty-one (agonizing!) years to publish Runes because he needed to grow as a writer. Reading Runes, I understand him completely. This book placed demands on him as a writer that he has never encountered before, and the growth during the intervening years served him well.    The result is a book to be savored, reread, and added to the canon of great fantasy. If the First Chronicles were the War and Peace of fantasy literature, I wonder how this will be judged. It is superior - superior to something that is already recognized as one of the most important works of fantasy of all time.	2004-10-15

Esme Squalor (no pun intended with regard to her last name I'm sure!), the city's sixth most important financial advisor, is only interested in something if it is \\"in\\", and so ridiculous is she that if light - actual sunlight - is \\"out\\", then down go the drapes and the entire apartment, all seventy-one bedrooms of it, is drenched in darkness. If elevators are out, then stairs must be climbed, floor by painful floor, from the lobby to the penthouse. If pinstriped suits, no matter how ludicrous they look on children, are \\"in\\", then the Baudelaires will be draped in them. And if aqueous martinis are \\"in\\", then one has an aqueous martini - which is a glass of water with an olive in it. Although when you consider that last one, it is certainly healthier than an alcoholic martini.    Her poor husband, Jerome, may or may not agree with the seemingly mad influences that bind his wife, but the poor man doesn't like to argue, so he goes along with her, even if it means eating salmon, which he particularly dislikes.    Count Olaf makes his usual appearance, in a disguise so see through that if it were a negligee it would be embarrassingly revealing, but of course he goes undetected. This is thought, by some, to be a weakness of the series. I disagree. I think it's one of the strong points. Count Olaf's single-minded determination to get his hands on the fortune of the Baudelaires, and the mind boggling lengths he'll go to get it, are all part of the charm of the tale.    And since Count Olaf is in the book, life is difficult, again, for the Baudelaires, and they find themselves working ever so closely together to try and escape the elaborate and well thought out plan (the plans, btw, get more intricate, and better and better as the series progresses). Once again, thisstory winds up not being about the horrible things that happen to the Baudelaires, but about this trio's ability to unite together. Their refusal to give in - which would be the easiest thing to do - is heartwarming and inspirational.    Whether or not they're successful, or how successful they are, is another story altogether, and that story is called, of course, The Ersatz Elevator.	2004-09-29

First the bad. <br /> <br />Captain Widdershins bore a striking resemblance to Willy Wonka in his style of speech and general flakiness. Whereas Wonka was entertaining, however, Widdershins was the most annoying character yet in this entire series. An example of his style of speech: \\"Aye! The Submarine Q and Its Crew of Two is not in the best of shape, I'm afraid!  Aye! We've been attacked by villains and leeches, by sharks and realtors, by pirates and girlfriends, by torpedoes and angry salmon! Aye! ... Everything from the radar mechanisms to my alarm clock is malfunctioning! Aye! That's why I'm glad you're here, Violet Baudelaire!\\" Ever sentence he speaks ends in an exclamation point, which makes for exhausting reading, and the four \\"Aye's\\" in this particular example were just too much. This is typical of his speech throughout his entire presence in the book. After the Baudelaire's left Widdershins, I thought the tedium of lunatic prose had ended.  <br /> <br />I was wrong. First, his stepdaughter assumed his manner of speech, just as she assumed captainship of the submarine. And then there was Olaf. Always Olaf. <br /> <br />I'm of the opinion that Count Olaf found his way into a mushroom patch much sooner than the Baudelaires, for nothing else can explain his complete change of character. To be certain, he still has schemes, plans, and matches to burn things with, but he has now been given the world's most annoying laugh, and his use of it in every sentence of dialogue is nonsensical. Count Olaf is no longer the fearsome adversary he has been for the past ten books. He has transcended the stark originality of his evil nature and is now banal and juvenile. I am incredibly disappointed in this change of character, not to mention bewildered. It's difficult to take a villain seriously when he laughs like this: \\"Ha ha ha heepa-heepa ho! Tee hee tort tort tort. Hot cha ha ha. Sniggle hee! Ha, if I do say so myself.\\" That is our first introduction to his laugh, and while the use of the word \\"tort\\" is amusing and clever (tort is, by definition, a wrongful act), the overall effect is one of annoyance. <br /> <br />Now the good. Unfortunately I can't go into too much detail about the good, or I'll be giving away some minor secrets. <br /> <br />We learn more about V.F.D., more about their codes, what their history was, although we certainly don't learn everything. Still, it's fascinating and interesting. \\"Snickett's\\" intellectual humor is in full swing, and I particularly enjoyed his repeated use of an archaic definition of the word lousy in Chapter Seven. Also, for the very first time, concepts of black and white enter the picture. Up until now, people were either good or bad. Now we're seeing shades of gray, and one of the characters we see this shade of gray in happens to be handled brilliantly. I was sadly, but pleasantly surprised to see this character do the unexpected. <br /> <br />Much of what we learn begins to put together a more complete picture of this hazy world that the Baudelaire's have been living in, and I can't be more grateful for that. It's been a long road to the denouement. <br /> <br />Last, the ending. It's the very best in the series. And of course I can say absolutely nothing about that. <br />	2004-09-22

The three children are given their most frightful and challenging test yet, as when they return home they find that the house has been ransacked and much out of place - including the Field Guide *and* their mother. Her loss devastates the children, as they have no idea how to find or free her. Then they happen upon Hogsqueal (or, rather, Byron happens upon him) and learn that he can lead them to Mulgarath's Palace where they hope to find and free their mother. <br /> <br />Along the way they are met with gruesome sights, and perform tasks they never could have imagined themselves doing in a hundred years, and their mettle is tested severely. None more so than that of Jared. But Jared has studied the Field Guide, and even though it is no longer in his possession, his memory serves him well. So does Arthur Spiderwick, who makes a brief appearance and offers most useful advice. <br /> <br />The ending began to seem typical, with Mulgarath in control and speaking of the how's and why's of his desire for domination. Even though his desire to speak has been explained earlier, it is a little tedious for too many \\"bad guys\\", i.e., Dark Lords and whatnot, do exactly this. However, the denouement is unique, original, and it made me laugh. <br /> <br />This was truly a delightful book, from beginning to end. The writing is top notch, and I can't say enough about the art. The book dips into darkness, rises into light, dips back into darkness and offers truly ghastly portraits that should keep kids on the edge of their seats and wishing their nightlights burned brighter. Also, I loved the character of Thimbletack, both how he was written and how he spoke. The rhyming was charming and delightful. <br /> <br />And the rhyme at the end of the book was most entertaining. I am looking forward to its fulfillment. <br />	2004-09-20

Did I get my fingering right? Was my bow held correctly? Did I have the violin tucked neatly enough under my chin, but not tightly? Then I realize that because I am a musical genius, of course I practiced the concerto, of course the fingering was right, of course my bow was held correctly, of course the violin was held underneath my chin appropriately. A musical genius would not make such mistakes. <br /> <br />Neither would a musical genius with the aid of an advanced computer system allow those troublesome Baudelaires to... <br /> <br />&#60;break&#62; <br /> <br />I apologize. That egocentric braggart, Vice Principal Nero took over my computer momentarily. He's an odd man, who seems to think that he runs the school, even though he's only the VICE principal, and if he's a musical genius, then the song about a cat on a hot tin roof really was about my cat being on a tin roof when lightning struck and not that other metaphor which I will carefully not reveal. I am trying to relate some of what happened to the Baudelaires while they were at my school, but Nero keeps butting in. I'll make sure that I don't leave my desk - with MY advanced computer - until I finish relating the events to which I have been privy. You see, I'm saying \\"my\\" because I am, in fact, the Principal. <br /> <br />Being the clodpole that he is - a word which hear means \\"a tone deaf person who is also apparently blind and possesses an I.Q. lower than that of a common forest mammal\\", even though Nero programmed Count Olaf's description into the computer more or less correctly, Count Olaf showed up to trouble the Baudelaire's again. I was extremely upset when I found out about it, especially when I learned the exact identity of the Count and the horrors he had subjected the Baudelaires to, such as notes from Carmelita Spats who is as nice as Nero is a genius. <br /> <br />But as sad as it was that Count Olaf returned to their lives and inflicted unspeakable tortures upon them (although the Baudelaires may all end up as world class athletes because of it and break many Olympic and world records), I was heartened to know that while they were here they made the acquaintance of the Quagmire triplets, Duncan and Isadora. Both Duncan and Isadora are very kind, intuitive, intelligent, and magnanimous children, so their association - the only friends the poor children have had since their parents passed away - was a blessing, even if the triplets were...well...I suppose I'm not supposed to give too much away. <br /> <br />Suffice to say that even though Count Olaf is thwarted in his attempt to capture the Baudelaires, the unfortunate siblings suffer a tragedy on par to that of losing their parents. Sadly, the Board of Directors, all members of an odd acting troupe who call themselves Very Fine Dramatists, won't let me fire Nero, and even though I am the Principal, I answer to this odd V.F.D. group. (Thankfully, they can't force me to attend his silly concerts, the screeching sounds of which seem to have scared away all of the crows in the area.) <br /> <br />P.S. As far as I know, there is only one Lemony Snicket. I can say with certainty that I have never met him, but I know that while Lemony Snicket is a pseudonym, this particular person wrote two *very* adult books using his real name before going undercover and researching the Baudelaires, so the theory of there being two \\"Lemony Snickets\\", which seems to be based on the writing in this particular book being more adult and mature, doesn't hold water - a phrase which here means, \\"the theory might as well be a bucket with many holes punched into the bottom of it, for if you pour any water into that bucket, within moments you'll have an empty bucket\\". Also, I might add that the Baudelaires are getting slightly older with each book, and given the despicable things that CountOlaf is trying to do them they can't help but mature at a faster rate than most children of their age. <br />	2004-09-16
US	50510246	R16N2TDJALIACT	0345314255	643750532	The Sword of Shannara	Books	2	26	49	N	N	Unoriginal ideas don't count, sorry	I have to admit that when I first read The Sword of Shannara (TSoS) back in 1980 as a freshman in high school, I was entranced and enthralled. I was delighted with the characters, the action, the magic - everything. <br /> <br />Then a horrible thing happened. I grew up, and realized that the reason I liked The Sword of Shannara (TSoS) wasn't because the book itself had exceptional merit. The reason I liked it was because it took me back to The Lord of the Rings, in terms of recreating characters, and it also did things that The Lord of the Rings never did, things I wished (as a teenager) that it had. <br /> <br />And it has nothing to do with an inability to see past The Lord of the Rings. I've seen past The Lord of the Rings dozens of times, notably with Tad Williams, Stephen Donaldson, George R. R. Martin, and, during the first few books of the Wheel of Time Series, Robert Jordan. They are all well written and original. The Sword of Shannara is *not*. <br /> <br />First, the characters. We can go down the list and draw direct parallels between them and characters in The Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br />* Flick Ohmsord - Sam Gamgee <br />* Shea Ohmsord - Frodo Baggins <br />* Allanon - Gandalf <br />* Menion Leah - Aragorn with a dash of Han Solo (although Brooks couldn't have known of Solo at the time he was writing TSoS) <br />* Balinor - Aragorn/Boromir <br />* Eventine - Take your pick of elven kings from the 2nd age of Middle Earth <br />* Dayel and Durin - Legolas <br />* Hendel - Gimli <br />* Skull Bearers - Nazgul <br />* Keltset - fairly original, but a slight resemblance to an Ent <br />* Warlock Lord - Sauron (remember, Sauron was pretty much there in spirit, and wouldn't be whole again, entirely, until he retrieved his ring) <br /> <br />There are other characters, some original, some not, but the main cast of characters is straight from the pages of LOTR.  <br /> <br />Regarding the things I wished to have read in the Lord of the Rings: I was always disappointed that we never actually *saw* Gandalf fight the Balrog, or the scene where he battled the Nazgul on Weathertop. I was hugely disappointed when Gandalf didn't engage the Chief of the Nazgul at the gates of Minas Tirith, and of course *immensely* disappointed that we never saw Sauron, and especially that we never saw Gandalf kick his tail in, which I was certain he could do, even if Gandalf himself wasn't. (Granted, later I came to understand that this was part of Tolkien's brilliance: he was so good, he didn't *need* to show us these things.) <br /> <br />In TSoS, we get to see some of these confrontations, and let's face it - it's exciting. Seeing Allanon battle one of the Skull Bearers was pure heaven for me back then, but it was only such because I imagined Gandalf battling one of the Nazgul. The same goes for Keltset's encounter, and others. <br /> <br />When I picked this up again as an adult, with the hope of reliving some of the magic, I discovered that this just wasn't what I thought it was. It was indeed, no matter how well intentioned, a retread of The Lord of the Rings. And while re-reading it, because the writing was so sloppy, I found myself wondering, \\"Is he writing an adult fantasy, or is this supposed to be geared toward kids?\\" I have read some of the books in his Landover series, and it's evident that his writing style is much more suited toward lighter fantasy. Yet he still continues to churn out Shannara books, written to adults that have become, sadly, a franchise. And a pretty poor franchise at that. <br /> <br />I don't think that Brooks set out to write a retread of The Lord of the Rings. I believe, as very prominent fantasist has said, that Brooks admired Tolkien so much that when he sat down to write his own story, emulation was inevitable. <br /> <br />And, contrary to what some may think, you *can* write bad books and sell millions of copies of them. Look no further than John Grisham for an excellent example. English teachers wielding red pens would have a field day with his prose. <br />	2004-09-12

In the end I decided that I had better things to do - but that only means that I was busy doing other things, and not that it wouldn't have been interesting or worthwhile. <br /> <br />This book contains the same wit that makes A Series of Unfortunate Events so powerfully readable, and it is absolutely full of clues regarding V.F.D, from who is in it, what its function is, and hints at what caused the schism. <br /> <br />When I put the book down I couldn't help but be amazed at the brilliance at work here. It's a story within a story within a story...like one mirror directed at another, its depth is endless. <br /> <br />It seems fairly obvious what V.F.D. stands for, given the clues we have, but knowing \\"Lemony Snicket\\" and the delight he takes in confusing situations, I highly doubt that it will be that simple. Heck, Count Olaf might turn out to be the good guy in all of this! Who knows? <br /> <br />The inside cover of the dust jacket was hilarious. \\"Lemony Snicket\\" really has a terrific sense of humor. I'm very, very grateful that these books were published; they are an absolute joy to read. <br />	2004-09-09

It is a mill run by a harsh taskmaster - here taskmaster means \\"a man whose name is unpronounceable and so requires everyone to call him `Sir'; is so apparently ghastly in his physical appearance that he hides his face behind a cloud of smoke at all times; who creates draconian working conditions for all of his employees (which even include small children, although that is in breach of hundreds of child labor laws!); whom he allows to eat only once a day; and whom he remunerates with coupons instead of money, which you and I know is utterly ridiculous\\". <br /> <br />Even worse is the weak willed partner of the harsh taskmaster, although he did try to create a library for the other workers of the mill. However, any library that contains only three books really isn't a library. At best, it's an ersatz library, but since ersatz is such an archaic word we should simply call a library that contains three books \\"a room with lots of empty shelves that contain only three books and some comfortable chairs\\". And everyone knows that such a variant room always serves as a harbinger of something, or someone, abominable, atrocious, and abhorrent. <br /> <br />There's only one person alive who fits that bill - a phrase which here means \\"is someone abominable, atrocious, and abhorrent\\", and contrary to popular belief, it isn't Bopo the Magnificent, a clown whose acquaintance I made many years ago. The person who fits that bill is Al Funcoot - better known as the very untalented playwright who wrote that abominable, atrocious, and abhorrent play The Marvelous Marriage, in which Violet starred and in which she was nearly married - but even better known as Count Olaf. <br /> <br />Here we see yet another of his dastardly disguises, and we cry rivers of tears when we see that all of the adults that could be helping the poor orphans fall for his disguise as Shirley the receptionist simply because he has a nameplate that says Shirley sitting on his desk. Although, come to think of it, if a person has a particular nameplate on their desk, it does usually indicate who they are. Perhaps that is the particular brilliance of Olaf's scheme. <br /> <br />We also see an exciting swordfight, broken glasses, tripping, and the all too familiar dust that...well, we'll just have to see, won't we? <br />	2004-09-02

If you rearrange the letters in Olaf's name - something referred to as creating an anagram - you would get the word \\"loaf\\". There are two different definitions of the word loaf. One of these definitions describes Count Olaf to a \\"T\\". Not an actual \\"T\\", of course, as that is merely an expression which means that you have described something perfectly, and we all know that Count Olaf isn't a letter of the alphabet.    One definition of the word is a noun, and is something that while being baked makes your mouth slaver and stomach grumble, and that you might cut into slices of bread and spread peanut butter on, or stick a slice of cheese between and grill them on the stove to make a grilled cheese sandwich. The other definition of the word loaf is a verb, and it means to \\"idle one's time away, typically by aimless wandering or loitering\\".    I don't think that Count Olaf is similar to a loaf of bread any more than he is a letter of the alphabet. But most certainly, the second definition fits the nefarious Count Olaf quite well.    Instead of trying to have a life of his own, he insists on wasting his life away by trying to steal the life that the Baudelaire's will have when Violet comes of age. This time he doesn't try to marry her, as he did in The Bad Beginning, because if he tried that plot it would fail simply because the Baudelaire's are familiar with it and would be able to see through it immediately and defeat it as handily as they did before. In The Reptile Room, he does something much more nefarious, so nefarious, in fact, that the very nefariousness of it frightens me to such an extent that I can not bring myself to describe it. I can only say, without shuddering, that the plot involves a disguise, a snake, a hue, venom, and something that makes even grown men shudder when they come across it in the doctor's office.    Once again it is up to the Baudelaire's and their formidable talents: Violet's inventing skills, Klaus's research skills, and Sunny's rather remarkable teeth (and her intimate relationship with them) to see them through. Will it be enough?	2004-08-26

Everyone knows that competent bankers are diligent people who try to place homeless orphans under the care of appropriate guardians, especially after the horrible things they've lived though because of the nefarious schemes of Count Olaf. Unfortunately for Violet, Klaus, and Sunny, they do not have a competent banker at their disposal. They have, instead, Mr. Poe, who doesn't even know how to keep the sniffles away, and even though he doesn't possess that simple skill, is the Vice President of an influential bank. <br /> <br />In The Wide Window, Mr. Poe finds another relative for them to live with: Aunt Josephine, who really isn't their Aunt but is their second cousin's sister-in-law, and Aunt Josephine might just be a worse guardian than Count Olaf. She's certainly a nicer person than Count Olaf is - the meanest bully on your block is nicer than Count Olaf - but she just doesn't cut it as a guardian. <br /> <br />Poor Aunt Josephine is an \\"almosteverything-o-phobe\\". When you see \\"-phobe\\" at the end of a word, it identifies a fear of whatever comes before it. For example, if you were afraid of mirrors, you would be called an \\"eisoptrophobe\\", which probably means that you don't like your haircut, and so can't stand to look at it. If you are afraid of words (in which case, you probably shouldn't be reading this review), you would be called a logophobe. If you were afraid of children, you would be called a pedophobe. Unfortunately for the Baudelaires, Count Olaf is not a pedophobe. Since Count Olaf is not a pedophobe, it's a shame that he is not at least chrometophobic, which would mean that he has a fear of money. <br /> <br />Aunt Josephine isn't afraid of everything, for she likes cold lime soup and tin cans. If she were afraid of everything, she would possess panphobia. There are so many things that Aunt Josephine is afraid of that, even though I've done exhaustive research, I haven't found words to describe her strange fears, which include a fear of docks, a fear of realtors, a fear of telephones, a fear of stoves (which might be thermophobia, a word which means \\"fear of heat\\", or pyrophobia, a word which means \\"fear of fire\\"), she even possesses a fear of the very lake that her house hangs over precariously - precariously here means \\"ready to fall into the lake at the slightest act of imbalance\\", and many, many others. <br /> <br />Count Olaf is back yet again with another scheme to place the Baudelaires into his custody, and he appropriately names himself, in this ridiculous and immediately see-through disguise (at least the Baudelaires, as usual, saw through it right away - which doesn't mean that they actually saw through Count Olaf as if their eyes suddenly became X-Ray machines, it simply means that they recognized him despite his disguise) as a renter of sailboats, Captain Sham. But unfortunately for everyone involved, not even Aunt Josephine, who might just be the best grammarian in the world, recognized that the word sham means \\"a person who pretends to be someone or something they are not\\". <br /> <br />This book, while dark and sad, has many exciting features, including a race across a lake in a sailboat during a hurricane (the lake is so large that it can support its own hurricane, which are usually confined to oceans) with Violet using her inventing skills to understand and operate the sails, Klaus using his reading comprehension skills to navigate the boat by reading an atlas, and Sunny using her ability to steer boats by means of manipulating the rudder. <br /> <br />Is their teamwork, which is fast becoming legendary, enough to save them from Captain Sh - Count Olaf? <br />	2004-08-26

Such it was with others: James and the Giant Peach; A Wrinkle in Time; The Earthsea Trilogy; The Hobbit; The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe; Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone; and now this. <br /> <br />The back of the book, which warns us to stay away with such perfect, perfunctory humor, and the dedication to Beatrice, \\"dearest, darling, dead\\", told me immediately, before I had read a single word, that I was about to be delighted again. And the book did not disappoint.  <br /> <br />Some have criticized this book, and its many sequels, for its uneven portrayal of grownups. But I think they're missing the point. From the dedication forward (even, or especially by naming the family after Charles Baudelaire), this is pure satire, and with satire, anything is game. So we have clueless grownups, exaggerated villains, and they all serve to demonstrate the ridiculousness of common situations. It just so happens that in the middle of this all, we have a very entertaining little story about a horrible man (Count Olaf - what a glorious villain!) who wants to claim the Baudelaire fortune, and tries to accomplish this by tricking (er, forcing) Violet into marrying him. How they escape this plot is really quite clever, even if it isn't rocket science. But it's not supposed to be. <br /> <br />Friends of mine have found the books entertaining, but have put them down because they were too depressing. I challenge that with vigor. Although the Baudelaire's find themselves in melancholy situations, they always persevere through innovation, dedicated teamwork, tremendous love for each other, and a refusal to accept the \\"darkness\\" that Count Olaf brings to their lives. There can be no more affirming message than that. I found this book, and all those that followed, uplifting. <br />	2004-08-20

This is simply the best of its kind, and I find myself using this regularly in my own writing. <br /> <br />It's impossible to be an expert on everything, or to remember every word that you've ever heard in your life. With this book, you'll be able to find and identify the words that are germane to the topic you're writing on, even if you won't know how to use them. For example, under Technology|Computers|Hardware and Peripherals, the acronym IRQ is listed. It's defined as an \\"Interrupt Request Line, a setting that controls communication of peripheral devices with the CPU\\". Now, that's one of the clearest definitions of an IRQ that I've ever come across in such few words, but seeing it there doesn't tell you how to use it. You'll still have some homework to do. <br /> <br />HOWEVER, if you need something like a title of rank, and are wondering what the proper term for the prime minister of an East Indian state is, you'll not only find it here, but be able to use it immediately. (The word, by the way, is Dewan.) <br /> <br />There are so many categories and subcategories that the scope of the book is daunting. I personally can't imagine putting it together, but am grateful that it was. <br />	2004-08-18

While The City of Ember may have been more inventive, in terms of an underground city that was on its last leg, this is infinitely more profound. <br /> <br />It's still inventive, though. A terrible Disaster has befallen the Earth, and the Emberites learn that they were sent to live below the Earth, in the event that the Disaster did, in fact, occur, and so that one day they could return to the surface and repopulate the world. If that isn't a terrific idea, I'm not sure what is. <br /> <br />The Emberites luckily find themselves in one of the more prosperous towns. As most in the town of Sparks are good and decent people, they agree to feed these strange newcomers for a certain amount of time, and while doing so teach them basic survival skills. As one can imagine, no Emberite possesses the skills to survive on the surface. All they knew was Ember, and the simple rules that governed survival in that city. <br /> <br />Sparks has its own governing rules, and Ms. DuPrau really shows a deft hand at creating intriguing cultures. It's obvious that she gave considerable thought to a post-apocalyptic world, and her vision of it is refreshing and true. <br />  <br />Sadly, greed raises its ugly head, on both sides, and the cultures have a terrible clash. But an important lesson is learned. It may seem trite to some, but it really is a powerful message. Paraphrased, it goes something like this: If someone does something mean to you, instead of doing something mean in return, try and do something good for them. The opportunity for such a deed presents itself, and we see this good faith effort in action. If I say more, it will be too revealing. <br /> <br />The ending of the book caused odd salty drops to fall from my eyes, because it brought the entire sequence full circle. The Emberites, we see, had something to teach the people of Sparks - and perhapsthe whole world. Together, they are stronger than they are apart. <br /> <br />It's a heartwarming and beautiful story. I look forward to her next book with immense anticipation. <br />	2004-08-18

Not that I know what that's like, but it's easy enough to imagine. <br /> <br />Then I saw this. And found that all of the thesauri collected in my library had become worthless.

You will want to order this in hardcover, for you will find yourself using it again, and again, and again, and again. <br /> <br />When I bought this book I actually did comparisons between the synonyms in this book and others, and was astounded. I don't remember the word offhand, but this book had over twenty synonyms, while Roget's had seven. An Oxford thesaurus had eleven, but that was as good as it got. <br /> <br />The most important thing about this book is that the synonyms are relevant. The author hasn't just packed a bunch of words together here to make it look good. <br />	2004-08-18

We know that something is afoot, that there is more to Ember than Ember, and that empowers us, to a certain extent - like when you're watching a movie and you know something that the characters don't. <br /> <br />We see the development of this through the eyes of two twelve year olds, both very different children. Doon has a temper and is rather sullen, and Lina is a bundle of hope and joy. But their depth goes beyond that. These are three-dimensional characters, a rarity in children's books. <br /> <br />Also rare is the sturdy, clear writing. It never felt rushed, always felt poised. The only thing that wasn't handled with perfection was humor. I should have laughed when Doon threw a shoe heel and it hit his father in the ear, but I didn't. But that's OK. Eoin Colfer can be funny, and Ms. DuPrau can simply be a better writer. <br /> <br />I found a few plot points strained: 1) Lina being the great-great-great whatever of one of the mayor's mentioned in the prologue; 2) Her own grandmother's mad search for something that now, in her dotage, she remembers is of the utmost importance; and 3) Poppy getting her hands on the thing that is important and rendering it nearly indecipherable. <br /> <br />But those are minor points. They exist to move the story from one point to another, and the story isn't really about the discovery of the Instructions for Egress, it's about the city of Ember itself, how its inhabitants have adjusted to living in a city where there is no light after nine (because the only light the city has is electricity and it knows nothing of the Sun), deciphering the Instructions for Egress, and the action of egress itself. I felt that the city of Ember, with its surprisingly complex social order was an ingenious invention, and the handling of all other points mentioned above was done masterfully. <br /> <br />When I finished reading this I couldn't help but think to myself: what a shame that more children will have read Shadowmancer than The City of Ember. The latter is a far superior book, in every way. <br /> <br />I found myself, more than once, wanting to walk the streets of Ember, just to see what it felt like. Ms. DuPrau did a terrific job of making this imaginative city real and tangible. <br />	2004-08-18

Its hallmark, in my opinion, was the patience which the author displayed in introducing and fleshing out characters, as well as the meticulous care he spent crafting a strong physical presence that made the word of Eldh tangible and solid. Strong fantasy was mixed with horror, mystery, and intrigue that gave the story a terrific cadence. So strong was the writing, in fact, that some of the clichs (character and plotting) were easily forgiven. Good writing can make even a bad idea sound good. <br /> <br />The Keep of Fire, unfortunately, possesses none of the qualities of the former. It had the distinct feel of a rough draft - as if Beyond the Pale was written in four years, and Keep of Fire was written in four months. <br /> <br />The author, for reasons that puzzle me, chose to skim lightly over material that, if fleshed out, would have made for exciting reading. Case in point: the time spent with the Necromancer. Robert Jordan, in a classic case of overwriting, could have written 500 pages on that alone. Mark Anthony should have, in my opinion, written at least 150. Yet there was barely 1/5 that amount. So much potential! Yet it ended in such disappointment. <br /> <br />I applaud the author for tackling issues that have long been taboo in fantasy: specifically homosexuality. Too often homosexual men have been seen as effete, useless fops. In the real world, we (well, most level headed people) know this is not true. So - kudos. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I have scratched Mark Anthony off my list of \\"must read\\" authors. Successive books came out too rapidly, and I'm not interesting in spending my money just to read what amounts to a rough draft. <br /> <br />(A notable post script: the metaphor \\"beyond the pale\\" is considered a moribund metaphor.) <br />	2004-08-15

How do these things happen? Well, you pray - for that's what is, you're not reciting spells, you're praying - to ancient Sumerian gods. I could easily write a book that did all the same things, and used many interesting and mystifying symbols and letters, by using the languages and alphabets that Tolkien created for Middle Earth. Seriously. <br /> <br />If you want to do better on your chemistry test - study harder. If you want the girl you adore to love you - be a better person. Don't look to this to help, because it won't.

The characters are much more well drawn out here than in Shadowmancer (the success of which still boggles my mind), and I care about them.

(Er, the Nac Mac Feegle that is)	Terry Pratchett is one of the funniest writers alive. Who else could leave their readers laughing so hard that their guts are spilling out of their sides over the actions of a piece of luggage? (Earlier Discworld novel.)    It's been many years since I've read a Discworld novel, and I'm disappointed that I allowed so much time to elapse. I thought that Pratchett, like Piers Anthony, would have lost the freshness of his work. Boy was I wrong. NEVER make assumptions. As he did many years ago, Pratchett has told an engaging, interesting story, and filled it with sensational humor.    The story, centers around nine year old Tiffany, a \\"witch-to-be\\". Another world is colliding with hers, and all of the monsters are coming back. A witch from yet a different world is concerned that Tiffany can't handle the defense herself, and leaves to get help. But Tiffany is headstrong (a good quality for a witch) and insists on defending HER world on HER terms.    She also has the help of the Nac Mac Feegle - otherwise known as The Wee Free Men, blue skinned leprechaun-like fairy creatures whose priorities are stealing, drinking, and fighting - not necessarily in that order, and they're more than happy to have a good row to determine the order. They stand roughly six inches tall, but are so strong that trolls (we assume here that a troll is much, much larger than a Nac Mac Feegle) run away from them. There is only one thing they fear: lawyers.    As usual, Pratchett is a satirist here, and he spoofs what are becoming clichés in the post Harry Potter world. His observations on that account are both funny and enlightening, without being insulting.    The ending seems to be a \\"homage-montage\\" of sorts, offering nods to Alice in Wonderland, The Chronicles of Amber, and other works. Tiffany finds herself beset with challenges that the brute strength of the Nac Mac Feegle can't solve, so she must struggle and face them with what she possesses most: common sense.    I have only one problem with this novel, and it is that there isn't a nine year old girl alive that's capable of what Tiffany is capable of - and that's no insult to nine year old girls, believe me! I wonder if, perhaps, Pratchett should have assigned her age at thirteen or fourteen - but even then I'm hard pressed to accept her remarkable resiliency and maturity under pressure.    But that's the only problem. It's an ingenious book, from beginning to end, and will entertain several different lobes of your brain at once - something most of Pratchett's books do quite well.	2004-08-11

Such it is with The Wish List. <br /> <br />When Beelzebub made his initial appearance, I practically sat straight up with my hair on end. Colfer has such a terrific sense of humor, and a remarkable ability with characterization, that I looked forward to the scenes with Beelzebub (and especially his ruminations on Satan) the most. That's not to say that the rest of the story was uninteresting - far from it. The story was refreshingly unconventional, and while I promised myself that I would never mention Artemis Fowl in a review about Colfer's other works, I feel the need to say this: This man can write books without Artemis Fowl in them. Unfortunately (?) Artemis Fowl - not just the character, but the entire series - is so riveting that it can be difficult to look past it and judge the rest of Colfer's work as standing on their own. <br /> <br />Well, difficult for some, but not for me. <br /> <br />This book tells the engaging and delightful story of a girl who made a series of poor choices in her life (although many can be forgiven due to the effects of her horrid stepfather), and one particularly bad choice. It's almost a delightful twist of such concept films as \\"It's a Wonderful Christmas\\", or perhaps even a satire, and it works brilliantly. It would have been very easy to fall into clich ridden roles and experiences, but Colfer is far too deft an author to fall prey to any of those. <br /> <br />Delightful book, highly recommended. <br />	2004-08-08

The story begins with Cosmo Hill at the Clarisa Fayne Institute for Parentally Challenged Boys, and this Institute makes Oliver Twist's orphanage look like a day spa. No-sponsors live here - children without biological or adoptive parents. And here they conduct scientific experiments on these \\"expendable\\" children, the same experiments that our society currently conducts on animals. It's a gruesome, heart wrenching sight. <br /> <br />A chance comes for escape, and Cosmo breaks free of Clarissa Frayne, although suffering terrible injuries while doing so, and before he is found by anyone that would deliver him back to the testing lab, he is rescued and healed by the self-titled Supernaturalists. They can see \\"Parasites\\", blue creatures who thrive on energy, and who are believed to suck the life source from humans. The sole purpose of Supernaturalists is to eradicate this strangely listless, supposedly evil species. Not many people can see these Parasites, but Cosmo can, and delighted to have found purpose, and finally something resembling a family, Cosmo joins forces with the Supernaturalists. <br /> <br />And then the story moves from a simple fight against these Parasites to a remarkable, breathtaking series of twists and turns. Some may be predictable, but many are not, and all are exhilarating. During one such twist I found myself staring at the page thinking, \\"I should have known\\", smiling, and impressed with Colfer's seemingly boundless creativity. <br /> <br />The only complaint I have is that during action sequences I had to pay very close attention to make sure that I was understanding what was happening, and even doing so, wasn't certain that I had it right. Also, some of the physical descriptions were lacking - again, I had to struggle to see them, and even so, wasn't certain that the image I was supposed to see was what my mind formed. Also, Cosmo was functioning fairly well for a child who had only one year left to live - given that the life expectancy of kids at Clarissa Frayne was 15 years. <br /> <br />But Colfer excels in other ways. He has a razor sharp wit which had me laughing on nearly every page, and an excellent feel for the emotions of teenagers. And his ability to create unique and fully realized universes within a bare minimum of pages is beyond compare. <br /> <br />If there were 10 stars, I would give this a 9. It's not a perfect work. There are only 5, and I think it's closer to \\"I love it\\" than \\"I like it\\", so I'm giving this a 5. <br />	2004-07-28

While all of the typical, clich?-ridden elements are here (elf queen, knight, giant, ogre, famous sword, dragon that needs to be slain), Wolfe makes you feel as if you?re experiencing all of this for the first time. <br /> <br />To be certain, the narrative structure is choppy and difficult to follow at times, but that?s part of the brilliance of the book. Wolfe is telling this story as a first person narrative, told ? truly told ? through the eyes of a teenager. How many fantasies have we read where the kitchen boy rises to be a great hero, but the story is told in an omniscient narrative voice? When you think about it, that doesn?t quite make sense. What does make sense is a kitchen boy rising to be a great hero, and ?hearing? the tale told through an extremely non-omniscient narrative voice. <br /> <br />That?s what we have here. Sir Able is as blank a slate as they come, and unlike other fantasies, there?s no wise old wizard to fill him in on the vast history of the big world he?s encountering. Sure, he has some help, but it?s hardly the kind of help we usually see in heroic fantasy where someone?s around to fill in all the blanks. The only help he gets comes in tiny pieces. Sir Able spends most of the book filling in the blanks himself, and we have to wonder, as readers, is he doing so correctly? Or is he, as a teenager, making mistakes as he goes along? <br /> <br />Still, as ingenious as this is, I would have liked the story to move along quicker, and I wish Sir Able?s eye had turned inward a bit more. I didn?t see very much of who he really is. I also had to push myself, at times, to move forward and get to the finish ? which was a very satisfying conclusion, and left me begging for more (something that the middle parts of the book itself didn?t often do). <br /> <br />I was delighted to read that Gene Wolfe was writing heroic fantasy, as I wanted to see his take on it, and the technique he employed.Now I?m looking forward to seeing how he ends it. <br />	2004-07-23

I?m quite certain that there were authors writing good high/heroic fantasy, but I wasn?t coming across them, and the authors that regularly cracked the New York Times bestseller list (Brooks, Salvatore, Eddings) were neither good nor original. I saw Robert Jordan?s comment on the cover of the book - ?It?s Brilliant? - and decided to give it a shot. Even though Jordan?s own work had been falling off, and continues to fall off as if he is just throwing paper off a cliff, he had written some remarkable fantasy earlier in the decade. More than that, I had met him in person once, and he didn?t seem the type to congratulate others unless such commendation was merited.<br />I sped through A Game of Thrones as if it were a two hundred page children?s novel. There is so much strength here, so much which is missing in most fantasy today. The characters are not only alive and believable, but they interact in ways that surprise us. The writing isn?t only immediate and perfectly crafted to move the story along at breakneck speed ? it is GOOD writing! That is a rare combination indeed, irrespective of genre.<br />Martin had me hooked early on ? in the Prologue, in fact. Orson Scott Card wrote that he never saw a Prologue that added anything to the story, and therefore thought they were unnecessary. Given some of the prologues I?ve read, I would tend to agree with him. But this is the exception that proves the rule. Because this is such an atypical fantasy (in stark contrast to Jordan, there is very little magic), that Martin needed to introduce some of the fantastic elements right away, needed to demonstrate that in his world there was something akin to evil.<br />But what *really* hooked me was the scene between Jon Snow,(...) son of Ned Stark, and Lady Stark, who *very* grudgingly accepted Jon?s presence in their home, Winterfell. Martin, talented writer that he is, led me by the nose, expecting one outcome, but gave me another entirely.<br />It was at that moment that I knew this book was going to be full of surprises. And it is.<br />Martin takes risks. He takes risks that very few writers would be brave enough to take. What those risks are, I can?t divulge. I?ll just say that at two key junctures in the book, when I thought for certain that typical fantasy elements would arise and the day would be saved, something entirely unlooked for occurred. I know that what I?m referencing is no longer a well kept secret, but still, I don?t want to be responsible for spoiling it for a new reader coming to this work.<br />As I said, this is atypical fantasy. Although Martin bears the R.R. initials, and although he holds Tolkien in the highest regard, he did not succumb to what so many authors did before him and write a Tolkien retread. This is simply the freshest, most original fantasy to come along in well over a decade. If one were to draw comparisons, and that?s not something I like to do with good authors (I?ll gladly compare Goodkind and Brooks), I would say that Martin has more in common with Sharon Kay Penman (who is the best writer of medieval historical fiction alive) and Alison Weir (one of the prominent medieval historians, capable of making ?dull? history exciting and tangible) than he does with anyone writing in the fantasy genre. And that?s high praise indeed.e outcome, but gave me another entirely.<br />It was at that moment that I knew this book was going to be full of surprises. And it is.<br />Martin takes risks.

This is simply the freshest, most original fantasy to come along in well over a decade. If one were to draw comparisons, and that?s not something I like to do with good authors (I?ll gladly compare Goodkind and Brooks), I would say that Martin has more in common with Sharon Kay Penman (who is the best writer of medieval historical fiction alive) and Alison Weir (one of the prominent medieval historians, capable of making ?dull? history exciting and tangible) than he does with anyone writing in the fantasy genre. And that?s high praise indeed.	2004-07-12

In some cases, it's more authorative - at least in se curing one's interest - than a textbook or encyclopedia. Rarely have I seen so much diverse information presented with such remarkable clarity. Visuals abound in this text, but don't let that statement fool you. The accompanying text, while brief by necessity, does an excellent job of explaining the basics.<br />If you're someone who knows a lot about a little, or are rather someone who knows very little about a lot, this book is a terrific reference for you. In other words, if you need facts at your fingertips, and you don't know everything there is to know in the world, this is a terrific book for you.	2004-07-06

Whereas the majority of readers are interested in the play for its basic themes of religion and the juxtaposing of the Medieval/Renaissance worlds, or for its value for the theatre, mine was specifically for *why* Faustus sold his soul to Mephostophilis, and what great feats of necromancy were performed.<br />Why was I interested in that? Certainly not because I have aspirations of being a Necromancer. That would be ridiculous. My interest was for research for a book that I'm working on, where a group of people engage in acts of magic that would be classified as necromantic.<br />So I was initially disappointed when I discovered that there was no necromancy here - nay, there is \\"nigromancy\\", which strictly defined means \\"black magic\\". That black magic is, of course, the summoning of Mephostophilis.<br />As I read further, however, I found that it contained exactly what I was looking for, and that the characters in the book I'm working on were surprisingly Faustian. The parallels were quite encouraging, and I took more from the work than I originally thought I would. I also enjoyed it tremendously for the themes and motifs which are its hallmark (mentioned above). It's a terrific play, and I'm now looking forward to seeing it performed.	2004-07-04
US	50510246	R228APUCE9VSUH	0375826688	342317933	Eragon (Inheritance)	Books	3	181	239	N	N	A reluctant 3	When first I attempted reading the book, I put it down within three chapters, as the word \\"derivative\\" pummeled my brain with the same febricity that dragons assault Paolini's imagination (and his imagination is assaulted with considerable frequency, according to Paolini on his website, hosted by Random House).<br />It was with reluctance that I turned to the book again, and I did so with the singular intent of understanding the remarkable success of the book. We can debate the merits of this book without end, but not its stellar sales.<br />And the reason for its success is simple. Not since The Sword of Shannara (or lesser works such as Niel Hancock's Circle of Light series) has heroic/high fantasy been dumbed-down to this level. Eragon is a book that requires no forethought whatsoever, little to no concentration, for all plot points are given away chapters in advance.<br />I don't hold any of the Shannara works (and certainly not the lesser works, such as Hancock's and others) in high esteem. What Brooks did with The Sword of Shannara was to rewrite The Lord of the Rings for teenagers, and in that he succeeded quite well. He didn't write an original book, however. The characters in The Sword of Shannara were almost one-for-one reproductions, with slight variations, from LOTR. Paolini has done essentially the same thing, but whereas Brooks had only Tolkien to draw from, Paolini had many more sources to draw from. And these sources pepper the landscape of his book like a person's salad who forgot to say, \\"Stop!\\"<br />We've heard that all art is imitation (and that therefore to imitate and even copy is OK); and that imitation is the highest form of flattery. In some aspects of art, literature, and life this holds true, but not here. There is too much imitation, and not enough originality. We have (from what I'm familiar of, anyway):<br />* The Thirteen Forsworn (Jordan's Forsaken)<br />* Elves on silver ships from across the sea (Tolkien)<br />* Urgals and Kulls (Orcs and Uruk-Hai from Tolkien with bits of Trollocs blended in from Jordan)<br />* Dwarves who are absolute reproductions of those from Tolkien, from their mountain city to their use of axes, and even the description of \\"hewing\\" heads off Urgals (er, Orcs)<br />* A Shade (Jordan's Fade, although with an intriguing difference - and it's not the color of the hair)<br />* Dragons and everything that comes with them (McCaffrey, although she doesn't seem to mind, if her blurbs mean anything)<br />* A \\"magic-user\\" (former Dragon Rider) who refuses to reveal his true nature for no good reason other than to cause dramatic tension (take your pick from any of the lesser derivative works)<br />* Ra'Zac (All wicked lords need hand servants...and they all get them, no different here)<br />* Somebody says \\"Hellfire!\\" This is an uncommon oath in the \\"real\\" world, but not an uncommon oath to Thomas Covenant. There were a couple of other Covenant similarities, but I didn't make note of them.<br />There are more, but this isn't intended to be exhaustive. Given what some truly great high/heroic fantasists have done (Tolkien, Donaldson, Martin, Williams, and to a lesser degree of late, Jordan), it is absolutely essential to make your own work your own. Is it easy? Not a chance. There are only so many original ideas, only so many different ways to write a high/heroic fantasy, but if you're going to do it, you can't just take what others have done, tweak it a bit, toss it into a blender, and put it out there as your own original work. This is NOT an original work.<br />As to the writing itself, I refuse to be too critical. This was written and edited by a *teenager*. Some of his descriptions of physical objects and places are excellent, even for a \\"stronger\\" writer. Yes, he makes the mistake of confusing salt with adverbs. Most food contains salt of some kind, especially true for prepared foods, and it seemed that way with his sentences. There are adverbs galore. That's a nasty habit he needs to say good-bye to.<br />As to the writer, well, after reading what he had written about his own work on his website, I lost some respect for him. Granted, this is still a very young person, but he is bragging of \\"wonders\\" to be revealed in his books, and says that \\"I strive for a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkien at his best and Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf\\". That's terrific to strive for, but his writing doesn't come close, and it's more than a little embarrassing, I would think, to make a comment like that. Maybe if Eragon stopped asking seven thousand questions so that Paolini could explain something that he could have done better through narration...but toward the end of the book I wanted Eragon's mouth closed with duct tape. When in Tronjheim, and talking to Angela, a very awkward segue occurs (one of dozens upon dozens in the book). Angela is speaking of Shades, and I'll admit that my eyes popped open a bit at the explanation because it was rather fresh and original. The Eragon ruins it by blurting out, \\"Why are you living so high up in Tronjheim? Isn't it inconvenient being this isolated? And how did you get all this stuff up here?\\" This just isn't sensible dialogue.<br />My final feeling is: I was initially turned off, and then pulled into it as I picked it up the second time, but ultimately turned off. I've read The Lord of the Rings, The Wheel of Time, The Dragonriders of Pern, and they're all better books than this. On the Random House website, Paolini jokes that perhaps an epic trilogy was too much for someone so young. He couldn't have been more right.<br />However, kids are reading this, and I'm in favor of almost anything that makes kids read more. Hence my three star rating. It would have been two stars otherwise.-bye to.<br />As to the writer, well, after reading what he had written about his own work on his website, I lost some respect for him.

I can't imagine what in the WORLD they were thinking, as I came to learn years later that in fourth grade reading they taught - you guessed it - grammar! And boy, did I suffer. My written grammar was absolutely horrendous for years, and even though I continued to be placed in advanced or honors English classes throughout high school, whenever my papers were returned to me the \\"concept\\" side came back with an A, and the \\"grammar\\" side came back with a D or an F.<br /><br />There's no substitute for learning young, but this is the closest thing to it. I've never seen a grammar book that's easier to understand than this one. Forget the Idiot's Guides or  Dummies books, and invest a little more in this one and the accompanying workbooks. If you're really interested in boning up on your grammar skills, this will be of tremendous assistance.<br /><br />Also, if you're looking to buy the workbooks, remember that this is the THIRD edition, that it is in blue, and so you should conduct your search for the accompanying workbooks by first identifying those that are blue, and make sure that they're for the third edition. There are several editions available here on Amazon, so buy wisely.	2004-06-29

I would imagine that the answer to my subject heading is, for most people, NO! But for me it was YES!, as I'd never had a physics class, and it was essential, for research that I am conducting, that I have slightly more than an elementary grasp of physics. I turned to this book, and am glad that I did.<br />This book, thankfully, is written in conceptual terms. There are few equations - because equations are necessary in science - but you don't need to know calculus or trigonometry to read this book and walk away with a solid foundation.<br />The author has a clear and easy tone about his writing, and breaks complex concepts down into their simple building blocks so that a typical layperson can understand. I know - because I'm as typical a layperson as they come regarding the sciences.<br />I can't recommend this highly enough.	2004-06-29

However, it?s a clever marketing technique, and it seems to be working. <br />Having read The Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, The Boxcar Children, and all sorts of ?simpler? mystery novels as a child, this really was refreshing. I wish something like this had been around (or that I had known of it) when I was in 6th grade. Even for an adult, it?s an interesting, provocative work, with excellent pacing and sure handed writing. And any book that increases interest in art, thinking, or ideas has automatically hit a home run for me.<br />Aside from the terrific storytelling and infectious plotting, I was very intrigued by the two main characters. Both are ?hybrids? ? a far cry from the typical Caucasian heroes we see everyday. Bravo to the author for the varied ethnicity!<br />It?s also a pleasure to read a book written ?in? Chicago. Too many novels take place in New York, or L.A., and believe me ? Chicago is culturally rich enough to support many more stories of this nature. <br />The hidden clues were fun to figure out. I?ve never had much of a brain for puzzles, so even one aimed at kids between the ages of 9 and 12 challenged me. It took me a while to puzzle the clues out, and when I did, I discovered that there isn?t only one solution! There are two, equally valid solutions ? the one on the website, and the one I found. And yes, there really are two ? even though I don?t possess a proclivity for this sort of thing.<br />I?m already anxiously awaiting Ms. Balliett?s next book. As she is a teacher in the Hyde Park area of Chicago (which is as rich and culturally diverse as it gets here), I hope to see even more of this magnificent city!	2004-06-25

It is grossly unfair to compare this author's work with Rowling and Tolkien. The aforementioned authors are geniuses, with Rowling creating a renaissance of \\"children's\\" books (indeed, we've seen some wonderfully written children's books that challenge children since the publication of The Sorcerer's Stone AND it's OK once more for adults to read children's books - yay!), and Tolkien single-handedly created a genre and wrote one of the great classics of the 20th century. THE great classic, according to numerous polls in Britain, which identify The Lord of the Rings as the most influential book of the 20th century. <br />Shadowmancer *barely* works, and it does so by the thinnest of margins. It has the distinct feel of a rough draft, with misplaced metaphors on virtually every page. It is written in fragments that hop from one scene to the next, introducing new characters that we care less about than the ones we were introduced to moments before, are given bizarre histories of these characters that are more senseless than the histories we know of fairy tale characters, and has the overall cohesiveness of paper that has been put through a shredder.<br />In any fantasy, whether it is aimed at children or adults, everything within it must be credible. The good magic, the bad magic - everything. In here, there is very little that is credible, even though the author is using well established religious themes as the focus, differentiating only by giving the various deities and angels different names, with the conspicuous exception of Raphael. I say that the book *barely* works because there is at least a hint of inventiveness, but even that hint of inventiveness disappears due to a distinct lack of credibility. The Varigals? Ridiculous! And the magic that Demural calls upon in the beginning of the book is ludicrous, and I laughed out loud when I read the scene. <br />I should care immensely for Kate and Thomas, and I don't. They are the \\"stars\\" ofthe book; however, they are largely ineffectual, if not entirely useless. I don't see the purpose for either of them. Once Raphah arrives on the scene, their necessity to the story completely disappears. With the \\"cliffhanger\\", I should be excited at reading the next book in the series. Personally, I can't believe there's going to be a second book.<br />I read that Taylor believed that villains in children's books weren't scary enough, and that was his impetus to create the wicked Vicar. Well, in order for something to be frightening, it needs to be believable. Obadiah Demural, because of a complete lack of believability with regard to his reactions, interactions, speech - everything about him - was about as frightening as Count Chocula. He's nothing more than a mean man who kicks his deformed servant. Wow. Terrifying.<br />Taylor just signed a lucrative deal with Putnam for his next six books. If his publishers don't insist on better writing, storytelling, and editing for his next several books(and they better have a whole team of crack editors ready and waiting for all of his manuscripts), they will find the rest of his books failing as quickly as Shadowmancer did. After spending a few weeks at #1 on the NYT bestseller list for children's books, it took a largely unprecedented nosedive. There was a reason for this nosedive: it's not a good book.	2004-06-25

As much as I hate to use cliché's, in this book absolutely nothing is as it seems, and clues hide themselves in the strangest of places. Oftentimes, the solution that seems most obvious is not the solution. What a wonderful book of twists and turns!<br />I was won over immediately by the writing style. At once dark and flippantly humorous, the author has a fine eye for detail, and more than once I found myself laughing out loud, only to be silenced moments later due to a suspenseful turn of events. You'll find, in the beginning, that a dictionary will come in hand, and I urge you to look up any words you don't understand. More often than not, you'll find that the knowledge of the word enriches the reading experience, and the quirkiness of the \\"big word\\" is appropriate for the setting. For example, phthisis means pulmonary tuberculosis. And as it's used in the book, it's hysterical. Really.<br />The actual game described in the title is astonishingly innovative; I've never seen anything like it. To say anything about it gives too much away, so I'll hope only that you trust me.<br />The Booklist review, as well as the inside jacket flap, do a wonderful job of setting the scene, so I'll end by saying: this book NEEDS to have a broader reading audience. At the writing of this review, the book ranked 73,034 on Amazon's listing. That must change. I have a very difficult time imagining someone reading this book and not being highly entertained, for there is ample entertainment value, of myriad kinds, on every page.

One thing that resonated with me while reading the book was that Dwarves are often mentioned as skilled craftsmen, but there is rarely anything to show just exactly how skilled they are (there are notable exceptions: see Tolkien). I was fascinated with the description of the lock on the cage that Simon and Jared were held in, that to create it the Dwarf had to use a hammer the size of a pin. The author's description of that particular scene, with the lock unlocking, was visceral and real.<br />Aided by the marvelous illustrations, this is also the scariest book yet. Mulgarath is truly a frightful looking creature, and the ending reveals a most terrible betrayal, which spells certain disaster for the children - and the world - unless the children can think back to \\"what has gone before\\". The author knocks us over the head, just in case we missed it, with some considerable foreshadowing by leaving a portrait blacked out - a mysterious hero who may come and save the day in the next book.<br />It's a shame Mulgarath wasn't introduced earlier. He seems like a highly workable character, but I believe that we will see MUCH of him in the final book, aptly titled \\"The Wrath of Mulgarath\\".<br />Frankly, I can't wait. I wish I hadn't started reading these books until all of them were published!	2004-06-24

Poor Jared with his temper - it's always getting him into trouble. His temper has the family in discomfort now, as Thimbletack has gone from being a friendly brownie to a menacing boggart once more. Mallory believes that everything ties back directly to the book, and she counsels firmly that they get rid of it, but Jared will have nothing of it! He claims the book as his own.<br />But the overriding question still exists: why do faerie creatures want this book? The all decide that the best person to ask is Aunt Lucinda, even though she's been rooted off to a looney bin. They decide to visit her, and indeed learn a great deal (and this is another scene where the authors flex their creative muscles, showing why - regardless of any comparisons to L.S. - they're in a league of their own), but also discover, much to everyone's dismay (and Jared's anger - he blames Mallory and is ready to fight her!) that Arthur Spiderwick's book is GONE.<br />They then find a note instructing them to bring the book to a certain location, but before reaching that location run into a Phooka who says things to them that, while seemingly senseless riddles, are most assuredly not. If the reader is careful and listens to what the Phooka says, and to what the Elves say when they meet them (for it was Elves who left the note, asking for the book), they will see a potentially most exciting development.<br />Once again, a marvelous read, with brilliant illustrations. I'm very glad that I'm reading these books back to back, for they're absolutely delightful reads. (Disappointing, though, that I'll have to wait a few months for the final book!)	2004-06-23

He views Arthur's book as his, as well as the knowledge contained therein, something further expanded upon in book 3, Lucinda's Secret.<br />The title of the book refers to a remarkably inventive device called the seeing stone, a stone which allows mortals to see faerie creatures. This comes in handy, because Simon (Jared's twin) is kidnapped by goblins very early on, and it is up to Simon and Mallory to save him. It would be difficult to save someone from invisible creatures.<br />This leads them through some interesting adventures. They go to the goblin camp, where they see many cages hanging from trees that contain animals, some of which are trying to escape; others who seem resigned to their fate. Simon is also in one of these crates, and rescuing him involves a nasty bit of spitting, a scene that will certainly cause considerable cringing. To save Simon, they must strike a deal with a troll - but can the troll be trusted?<br />The reason the goblins kidnapped Simon is, of course, because their real goal is to get their hands on Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You. Why do they want it? Can goblins even read? While they may be strong for their size, they certainly don't seem wise. This is a puzzle that the children can't work out.	2004-06-23

Charlie can look into portraits and hear people talk. In the first book in this installment, we get a few examples of that, and what he hears is mainly of the garden variety: \\"Sit straight,\\" \\"you're too fat in your bikini,\\" etc. But we are also told in that same book that after Charlie's father died that Charlie's Grandma Bone (his father's mother) took down every picture of him in the house. If that isn't a smidgeon of foreshadowing, then I'm unfamiliar with the word.<br />Here we have the second installment in the series. Back in 1916, the horribly cruel Zeke Bloor sent his cousin Henry Yewbeam into the future - Charlie Bone's future, of course - using a magical device called The Time Twister. Now, it's somewhat unbelievable that Zeke, a person whom we know craves power, would let something so valuable out of his reach merely to send off a cousin for whom he cares little and whom poses no immediate or distant threat to him, but this is where suspension of disbelief comes in. Without this occurrence, there is no story. So we must accept it, and while it's somewhat glaring, the suspension of disbelief can be honored, mainly because Ms. Nimmo is writing for a younger age group than the Potter crowd.<br />Fast forward to present day, and we find all of the malevolent forces at Bloor's academy aware of Henry's arrival, and Zeke - now Ezekiel Bloor, a crustaceous, horrid beast of a man - is still intent on doing away with his cousin. This is the second major time where we are asked to suspend disbelief. Why in the world would a 100 year oldman care what a 10 or 11 year old boy does? Again, especially when that boy is, himself, not one of the endowed, and poses no threat to Ezekiel. The answer is spite. And evil people tend to possess a few common qualities: avarice, paranoia, and spite. Still, I had a much more difficult time understanding the motive behind the Bloor's and their cronies making poor little Henry Yewbeam's life so miserable. Why were the Yewbeam aunt's and Grandma Bone so concerned with where he was?<br />Regardless of this, Ms. Nimmo is a gifted storyteller and pacer, and, as before, she has created a story that is populated with believable and likable characters (mostly on the good side - the bad side is slightly less believable, if only because we don't spend much time with them so little character development is possible), all of whom any reader would have great affection for. So the story, even accepting this suspension of disbelief, is a thoroughly enjoyable one.<br />Because Henry is a relative, and because Charlie is the quintessential good guy who will do whatever he can to help his friends (a marvelous quality, really), they try to rescue poor Henry from the clutches of the Bloor's. Their attempts make for a terrific and blazing read. We also see a little more of Charlie's gifts. Anyone who read the first book must have asked themselves: \\"If he can hear portraits, what about paintings?\\"<br />A final thought to ponder: when will the Tree and the flames - if ever - reveal their true identities, and give the Bloor's and the nastier Yewbeam's their comeuppance? Or will that task reside entirely on Charlie Bone's shoulders?	2004-06-21

Here, both viewpoints were equally appealing (although if my arm were twisted I'd say that I enjoyed Bartimaeus's segments a little better, if only because he was the only one capable of explaining the universe and system of magic best). Stroud is indeed a gifted writer, for not did he succeed as stated above, but he also created characters that we care about (in my opinion, that's the most important job an author has), the plot never stalled, and we are left with a most satisfying conclusion, along with a deep thirst for more.	2004-06-21

In the third installment of the Children of the Red King series, a considerable amount of depth is assed, and Ms. Nimmo stakes out her own territory fiercely. This book was the best yet. Any doubt that additional depth was on its way should have been put to rest upon viewing the genealogical table (which, disappointingly, gave away a few endowments that I wasn?t aware of, but it didn?t affect the story).<br />The book is, in its basest form, about a boy who was made invisible by ? who else ? that wretched disaster of a magician, Ezekiel Bloor, and the efforts of Charlie and his faithful band of do-gooders to rescue him. But there is much more than an invisible boy for Charlie to worry about.<br />His best friend Benjamin has gone with his parents to Hong Kong, so Charlie has to find a way to keep Runner Bean occupied without Grandma Bone finding out about him. He is introduced to a new girl, Belle, who will be attending the academy, but not through the usual way ? that is, not at the academy on the first day of classes. He is introduced to this girl, who is the most beautiful girl in the world and whose eyes constantly change color, at his own home by his horrific aunts and Grandma Bone. The manner of their introduction isn?t lost on Charlie, and he is wary of her from the beginning.<br />His Uncle Patton leaves, mysteriously, speaking of ?someone dangerous? that must be stopped from arriving, and Charlie finds himself without the comforting presence of his uncle, who has begun to serve as a very effective buffer between Charlie and the Yewbeams. When his Uncle finally returns, the manner of his return is such that Charlie feels compelled to revisit the painting of Skarpo the Sorcerer in the hopes that Skarpo can help his Uncle, but Charlie succeeds in doing two things: 1) adding mystery to the white wand he ?stole? in book 2; and 2) unleashing a very unpleasant series of circumstances not only on Bloor?s Academy but also on the people who live in the surrounding town.<br />As we are finding out, there is more to everything than meets the eye ? even if some of it is rather obvious. And the universe is expanding, most satisfactorily. We can see possibilities for more books, and indeed it has been stated in at least one place that this is a projected series of five books.<br />I have only a few issues with the series in general, and the main one is: why does every book have to be centered around someone that the Bloors and/or Yewbeams are hiding or don?t want to be found? And why does it make such little sense (to me at least ? it?s entirely possible that my tiny brain is missing something rather obvious) that the Bloors and/or Yewbeams don?t want these kids found? Especially since this last book was action packed from beginning to end, and between Skarpo, Belle, Uncle Patton, and other minor subplots there was plenty around which to write a book. I hope that the next two books will use a more clever contrivance around which to center the story.<br />Last, AND THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR THOSE WHO THINK THESE BOOKS ARE POTTER RETREADS, I had an issue with what happened to Charlie at the end regarding a certain wand and a genealogical table (not the one in the beginning of the book).. I won?t describe anything more, because I don?t want to give the ending anyway. Anyway, this event seemed to be the most glaring Potter similarity yet, and I admit to actually gasping out loud when I read it. I assumed that Ms. Nimmo, as she is no stranger to children?s entertainment, *must* have read Potter, and therefore I was dumbfounded, wondering why in the world she would do something like this. However, I wrote to Ms. Nimmo, and she confirmed that she has never read the Potter works, except when her publisher tells her to take a peek at certain parts. Given that she?s never read the books, then, all of the Potter similarities are entirely accidental. This was an answer that pleased me greatly, for I have absolutely loved these books.	2004-06-21
US	50510246	R2IL5G8NRHDXQ2	0618126988	619220705	The Silmarillion	Books	5	26	28	N	N	Better than any Mythology	In The Silmarillion, Tolkien, himself a devout Christian and student/professor of mythology, has created something far more interesting and readable than that which he himself studied.<br />He creates a cosmology that is a combination of that which he believed to be real (Christianity), and that which he believed to be mythology. At the very top sits Iluvatar, also known as Eru, or The One - obviously, God. Below him are the Valar, what I refer to as Tolkien's version of the head deities of various cultural mythos, be they Greco/Roman, Norse, Sumerian, or what have you. Below them are the equivalent of archangels or demi-gods (the Maiar) - we see them clearly in the Lord of the Rings in Saruman, Gandalf, Sauron and - believe it or not - the Balrog of Moria.<br />Some call the stories contained within The Silmarillion dry and boring. I can't see how. If the book is taken as a work of mythology, as it was intended to be read (from which both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings were somewhat accidentally withdrawn), it reads much easier than the Bible and practically every mythological work I've ever read.<br />Within The Silmarillion, mainly, we are told of the Creation of Middle-Earth and all of the races that eventually populate that world. We are shown in narrative form the disgrace and downfall of Melkor, later called Morgoth (the Satan/Lucifer character) and that is so much more intriguing and fulfilling than merely being told of it happening. There is a compendium of the Valar, describing their various powers and stations, a history of the race of the men of Numenor (from which Aragorn is a descendant), and the crux of the book - the History of the Silmarils (Quenta Silmarillion). <br />The Silmarils were three jewels created by Feanor, one of the most gifted of the race of Elves (not the Elf we see in Legolas, or even Elrond or Galadriel, but an Elf far greater and more powerful). Within these jewels Feanor set the light of the Two Trees of Valinor (the home of the Valar). Morgoth destroyed the Two Trees of Valinor, and then stole The Silmarils, setting them within his crown, and held within Angband, his Barad-dur, so to speak. Quenta Silmarillion is the valorous tale of Feanor's impossible quest to regain that which was his, and the wreckage that followed in the wake of that quest.<br />There are more stories within, including a history of the rings of power and the third age, and for those interested, an in-depth detail on how Sauron (who was himself the greatest lieutenant of Morgoth, and fought with him in the great War of the Silmarils) infiltrated himself amongst the Elves and learned their craft of ring making, thus setting the scene for The Lord of the Rings. It is a fascinating account, and makes for great reading.<br />For fans of the Gandalf, it should be of interest that he is here identified as the wisest of the Maiar. In Unfinished Tales, when he is asked to accompany others of his order to go to Middle Earth and help with their struggles against Sauron, he says that he is weary from his travels and that he fears Sauron. Wise indeed, for Sauron in his avarice, unlike Gandalf, desired Middle-Earth to be his own, whereas Gandalf was content merely to enjoy the creations of Iluvatar. Greed is and should be frightening even to those who are strong enough to defend against it.<br />The Silmarillion is the work that firmly places Tolkien atop all others in his field, for it demonstrates a breathtaking imagination and work ethic. One wonders what The Silmarillion would have looked like if he had not been burdened with teaching to subsist. The Lord of the Rings never made an enormous amount of money during his lifetime (unlike current authors for whom he paved the road today - J.K. Rowling, Robert Jordan, etc.). We'll never know, but what we've been given is a work of astonishing wonder and brilliance.	2004-06-21

US	50510246	RXYXBIVJWAOWK	0689859368	904663340	The Field Guide	Books	4	43	46	N	N	A Good Start	What better place to begin a children's fantasy series than a mysterious, run-down old Victorian? Anyone that knows anything about Victorians knows that they have enormous storytelling potential, as many of the larger, older ones have attics and crawl spaces galore. A perfect place for faeries, good or bad, to be hiding out, and for children to go exploring.<br />For a twin, poor Jared Grace seems oddly the quintessential loner - the typical setup character who sees and believes in the elements of fantasy first, but whom nobody believes. Nevertheless, it's impossible, through both the writing and the deft illustrations throughout, not to have empathy for him. I \\"fell in love with\\" Jared in the first two pages, and maintained that throughout the story, which, while short, was still lively and well paced. Jared, who characterizes himself through the narrator as aimless and not the smart one (the smart one is Simon, his twin), is the character who is determined to solve the clues he is faced with, and upon realization that their families disruption of a faerie creatures habitat is the cause of all of their weird troubles, sets the situation right all by himself.<br />While comparisons to Lemony Snicket are inevitable, I found more similarities to L. Frank Baum, particularly in chapter titles, such as \\"In Which Two Walls are Explored by Vastly Different Methods\\". I particuarly enjoyed the drawing of the boggart in the final scene, as it was reminiscent of Jon O'Neil's wonderful and still (in my opinion) unparalleled artistry in children's books from the Wizard of Oz series. And kids - if you haven't read all of Baum's Oz books, rush to the library or beg your parents to buy them for you here on Amazon (*grin*) for they are amazing and wonderful, and in this most delightful rennaisance of children's fantasy, should not be forgotten. More than one hundred years ago, L. Frank Baum started it all.	2004-06-21

And he also reminds us that Jason was 18 when these events happened, so if he's a little self-absorbed, that can be forgiven. I can accept that too. (Though it was difficult at times...hence the title of this review. I mean come on, he's a fairly good looking guy, but he won't be People's sexiest guy alive anytime soon, though he seems to think he will.)<br />What I found frustratingly absent, though, was MORE. More of Gacy's letters. More of what Dahmer wrote. Etc. Too much of the book seemed -- to this humble reviewer at least -- an explanation for why Jason did what he did. As if it were more a book about Jason Moss than John Gacy, et. al. After the fourth chapter I found myself thinking &quot;Ok, he's gotten that out of the way, now we can get to the meat.&quot; But it continued on and on and on, and even when we got to the &quot;meat&quot;, it was still there.<br />All that said, my hat is off to Jason. He displayed an enormous amount of cunning and courage to play the game that he did with America's most notorious convicted murderer of young men. Another reviewer commented, I believe, that if you can get through the author's arrogance, there's some good stuff here. And that's true. There is. His meeting with Gacy is chilling, and is an absolutely fasinating capture of an encounter with evil, or whatever Gacy and his ilk can be defined as.<br />One final note. Jason Moss is obviously a young man of superior intellect. For someone so gifted, he displayed very little common sense in putting his family at risk. Giving Charles Manson and Richard Ramirez -- maniacal psychopaths with plenty of outside contacts/disciples -- your home address just isn't in your family's best interests. Shame on him for that.	2001-09-10

When I pulled this book out of the box, I was extremely disappointed.  The front cover of Killer Clown is unnecessarily garish, bearing a closer resemblance to the National Enquirer than a solid, well written book (which it is).  The back also proclaimed that there were &quot;16 pages of shocking photos!&quot;  With one or two exceptions, they're hardly shocking, although I did pause over the one picture of a victim they chose to include.  But that was more in sadness than in shock -- it was the face of an innocent, apparently happy young boy, and that spoke more strongly than any amount of gratuitous schlock could hope to.<br />This was a well thought out book, and kudos to Terry Sullivan and Peter Maiken for not drawing on the wealth of gore that came with Gacy's case.  I agree with the other reviewers with regard to its methodical step-by-step review of the entire case, from his last murder to the handing down of the death sentence.<br />It's a shame, though, for I'm sure that some serious students of true crime may have passed on this book simply because of its packaging.  If you're having similar qualms -- don't.  This is a worthwhile read.	2001-09-09
US	50510246	RBJHESA22KUAU	0345348656	150650131	Lord Foul's Bane (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 1)	Books	5	7	13	N	N	Beauty on a grand scale	I was a freshman in high school when I bought this book at the local bookstore.  Just having finished The Lord of the Rings, and The Sword of Shannara, I was eager to discover what it was that caused critics to say that Donaldson played hardball to Tolkien's softball.  It wasn't long before I found out.<br />Thomas Covenant (for those who don't look for allegory in fiction, think of Christianity's doubting Thomas), a leper from the &quot;real&quot; world, is transported to a magical place, refered to simply as &quot;The Land&quot;, where through its innate Earth-power, he finds his leprosy healed, long dead sensations returning to him not like glory, but rather like plague.  So long has he tied his identity to that of a leper (outcast unclean!) who is comfortable only in self-pity, and so convinced is he that what he is experiencing is not real, that he allows himself to lose control, rapes the girl who helped to heal him.  It is a sobering beginning, one which sets the tone for the rest of the series.<br />Here in the Land, Covenant learns that the white gold wedding ring he still wears--though divorced, as his wife left him, took their son away in fear after he contracted leprosy--is a paradox.  White gold does not exist in the Land, is not bound by the laws that rule and subdue the Land, and is the keystone of wild magic.  &quot;There is wild magic graven in every rock, contained for white gold to unleash or control...&quot;<br />What Donaldson does here is create a *true* fantasy world.  Not one modelled after medieval or Renaissance Europe, not a copycat of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings (though, indeed, in this series, the fate of the world rests in a reluctant hero and a ring -- but the similarity ends, severely so, there), but one crafted from his heart, like a fairy tale.<br />The strength of this book lies not in its plot; indeed, I find the plotting here to be simple, a trend that does not continue in the next two books of this trilogy.  While this is the story of a quest (The Lords of Revelstone set out with Thomas Covenant to wrest the Staff of Law from Drool Rockworm, to keep it away from Lord Foul himself who delves deep within the earth for banes far more powerful and vile), it is also the story of an anti-hero and his discomfort, his challenges.  It is easy to dislike Covenant, easy even to hate or despise him.  We fall in love with the Land that Donaldson creates, see that Covenenant himself loves the Land, and yet it is Covenant's inability -- or refusal -- to come to terms with his own Unbelief, that may spell disaster.  As a teenager I found myself longing to step into the pages of this book, wrest the ring from Covenant, and challenge the Ravers (Foul's servants), Drool Rockworm -- even Lord Foul, if he dared.<br />Lord Foul -- who is he?  He is &quot;...the Despiser...Satansheart and Soulcrusher...Fangthane...Corruption...the Gray Slayer.&quot;  He is every bit our Devil, is trapped in the Land by the Arch of Time as Lucifer is in Hell, and lusts to break free from his prison, to challenge his &quot;enemy&quot;, known simply here as the Creator.<br />Covenant, it seems, is the only one who can stop him.	2001-02-19

This desire resulted in three Christmas presents from my parents: The Queen's Man, The Reckoning, and When Christ and His Saints Slept.<br />I tried reading WCAHSS at least two or three times, but found myself frustrated.  My knowledge of medieval history has never been strong, and not knowing what was truth, what was fiction, I felt strangely uncomfortable.  The books sat on my shelf for a few years, until last November, after finishing a high fantasy novel, I decided again to read something more firmly based in reality.  Looking at The Reckoning, and WCAHSS, I quickly came face to face with the same frustrations as before -- I didn't know what to believe, what to except on faith, what was real, what was not.  So I picked up The Queen's Man, seeing that it was not history, per se, believing that with this I could get a grasp on Penman's style, perhaps a bridge into the larger historical works.<br />I was hooked immediately.  Justin de Quincy's character was likeable (in a somewhat modern sense), and Eleanor of Aquitane was regal beyond measure.<br />Not having read much mystery, outside of a few Grisham novels and The Alienist, I didn't have much to judge this against.  Others have said it is not a strong &quot;mystery&quot;, but it worked for me, kept me intellectually engaged throughout.<br />I fell in love with this book, with Penman's writing, and immediately bought Here Be Dragon's.  While I acknowledge that this book pales in comparison to the majesty of Here Be Dragons, what would normally get 3 stars, here gets 4 -- without this, I never would have entered the greater side of Penman's works, and indeed a debt is owed.	2001-02-18

To get back to his beloved Africa, he is given the charge of finding out what happened to John Maypole, a curate who was engaged to the daughter of his sponsor-the wealthy Bishop Hannay-and who disappeared one day leaving no clues behind. <br />Two things struck me while reading this book. First was the quality of Smith's prose. Repeatedly I found myself thinking, \\"If Fitzgerald and Hawthorne sat down together to write a mystery, this is what they would write\\". The book is full of metaphors, most obvious being the coal mine painted as hell, and the town itself (Wigan), an awkward purgatory. Second, Smith's ability to take us to that place and time was remarkable. The amount of research required to write a novel set in a different time and place is daunting, and to be able to collate that research into a well structured story is nearly unfathomable. I saw the town, smelled it, felt the brass tipped clogs crashing into my shin, my ribs when the miners fought. <br />The ending, too, is satisfying, especially as it is unconventional. Don't expect to gasp like you may have when the secret of Scott Turrow's Presumed Innocent was revealed, or when Bruce Willis' character in The Sixth Sense made his revelation, but keep an open eye	2001-02-15

I have to admit to the smallest of disappointments, however (note, still, that I'm giving the book 4 stars, which is VERY GOOD).  Being new to the actual history, I read a little about Simon de Montfort before tackling this, saw him referred to as one of the most powerful personalities of his time.  Perhaps I expected too much, or something different, but I had a difficult time balancing the Simon de Montfort in Falls the Shadow with the Simon I read of in the history books.  I also had more of a sense that I was being *told* that Henry was incompetent, instead of shown -- as if I (the reader) was being rushed through this book to get to the next, which I've just started reading.  In stark contrast, I didn't need to be told that Llewelyn (in Here Be Dragons) was great -- I knew by reading that he was.<br />But that's as critical as I can be of the book.  Oddly enough, when reading Nell's &quot;conversation&quot; with the dead Simon, it was almost exactly two years ago to the minute that I had lost a dear partner, and once again I give SKP the highest marks for getting directly in touch with the emotion of loss.  As well, the conversation between Nell and Edward, when Nell presented Edward with her list, was perfection.  She adeptly scripted Edward, who loved Nell with all his heart, but bore no love for Simon.  His guilt, if it can be called that, was well done.<br />I also enjoyed her treatment of anti-semitism.  Not being anti-semitic, the deep passion of its roots anti-semitism have long escaped me.  As SKP said in her afterword, she made no apologies for it, presented it as it was, and did a terrific job.  I saw through the eyes of a 13th century Christian why Jews were so reviled.  It was sobering, for I couldn't help but wonder how different the world would be if such bigotry had never existed.  It was a better history lesson than I've ever received.eceived.	2001-02-13

I will share a comment that I included in a letter that I sent to Mr. Martin.<br />&quot;At the risk of seeming like a rabid, obsessed fan, let me say this: not since I read Tolkien some 20 years ago have I been so in awe of a writer of fantasy.  To be certain, Tad Williams, Stephen R. Donaldson, and Robert Jordan have done some terrific work, but I have always held that Tolkien is the &quot;untouchable&quot; Shakespeare of this genre.  Your work is worthy of being performed in his theater.&quot;<br />I'll touch a little on Robert Jordan here.  I swear that Winter's Heart was a better book -- finally! -- and I wouldn't be at all surprised if it was because of Martin, who has -- to use that horrible corporate phrase -- raised the bar on contemporary fantasy.  He is telling a lengthy tale, but even in 900+ pages, he is doing it with an economy of words.  He tells what needs to be told, and then moves on.<br />Who creates beautifully realized, popular characters, moves ahead with a story line with that character at the center, and then &quot;sends&quot; the character off?  And THEN comes back just as strong, with another character, and another storyline, still interesting, still fresh, still vital?  So far, only Martin.<br />Let's see who else follows.	2001-02-09

Or, as I'd refer to them: &#34;things that have already happened in real life. This isn't fiction loosely based on history. It's fiction tightly bound by history. Adding a spoiler diminishes the author's work, IMHO,   I was first introduced to Sharon Kay Penman through her so-called Medieval mystery, The Queen's Man.  Eleanor of Aquitane was so vivid and real, so drawn was I to that character, that I bought Here Be Dragons just to see more of this most regal of matriarchs.  Before doing so I read reviews here on amazon.com that indicated that The Queen's Man was a far cry from her best work, that her best was to be found in the longer, historical work.  I scoffed, thinking that these were disgruntled, spoiled readers who didn't know how to adapt to a change from their favorite author.  Barely 50 pages into Here Be Dragons, I realized how horribly wrong I was.  Every time I set the book down, whether it be to turn off the light to sleep, or finishing lunch at work, or getting off the train in the morning or evening, I felt ripped away, so very much out of place. Knowing little about the history of the period, I allowed SKP to be my guide, stopping along the way to check facts, names and places, always impressed when I found her accuracy to be perfect.  Would that all history read with such passion, such verve! SKP writes emotion as accurately as she does history.  I have experienced the loss of a loved one, myself come too close to death, and when John died, her telling of it kept me up, staring at the ceiling for nigh on thirty minutes, my own memories brought back, real and cold.  That tears fell, I am not ashamed to admit.  I cried for the death of the evil King John. A shy romantic in life, I care little for romance in my fiction.  Imagine my surprise when I found myself more interested in the relationship between Llewelyn and Joana than virtually anything else.  History isstranger than fiction, true, and this was as unlikely a pair as could be imagined.  Yet their love was strong, and true, and overcame Joana being torn in two between the father who showed her love when she was orphaned, and the husband who showed her heaven, as well as Joanna's own indiscretions.  Since most who read or will read her work know the history, I'm not afraid to give up that little secret: Joanna committed adultery, and yet Llewelyn's love for her was so great that he forgave it.  Perhaps not such a great thing in today's day, but a monument in 13th century Europe.  Myself, I didn't know the history, and shed tears at the thought of Llewelyn and Joanna forever apart, shed them again when he took her back. Rarely have I read a book more beautiful, with prose more even and yet evoking such emotion.	2001-02-09

I wasn't remotely interested in anything that was happening, and was stunned at the amount of space Jordan was taking up with repetitious and unnecessary descriptions of people, trees, clothes, etc.  I picked it up again, recently, because I realized something: while I have lost faith in what Jordan is currently writing, I haven't lost faith that he knows where he's going.  He has said, in numerous interviews, that this series started at the end -- that he first saw in his mind the final scene.  Initially he saw the series lasting 3 or 4 books.  I would imagine those plans flew out the window after he was midway through The Eye of the World.  Anyone who has tried their hand at writing knows that a story grows with the telling.  Characters and events have a way of invading the story, of demanding entrace.<br />That said, when I picked this book up for a second time, I did so at a further disadvantage.  I had just finished reading three of Sharon Kay Penman's novels (Here Be Dragons -- extraordinary!; Falls the Shadow; and The Queen's Man) AND A Storm of Swords.  I was spoiled.  While Penman and Martin are both &quot;wordy&quot; writers, they are still economical.  The say what needs to be said, tell what needs to be told, and move on.  Going from Penman/Martin to Jordan was quite a jolt, as I again found myself frustrated with his pacing.  I wanted to insert mySELF into the story and set a penance on Elayne and Nynaeve &quot;on principle&quot;.  I have never read one of his books as quickly as I did this, skimming over whole paragraphs --something I would have considered a sin in one of the early books in the series, where skimming a paragraph meant I might miss something important.  Here, I neither believed I would miss anything important, nor cared if I did, and I didn't get the sense that he truly cared about what he was writing until the story turned to Rand.  Perhaps I'm wrong about that, and I probably am, but I don't care about the characters the way I used to.  When Nynaeve broke through her block, when Egwene was raised to Amyrlin, I cheered.  Now I'm hoping that Moghedien chances upon Nynaeve in her sleep and cuts off her air, that Elaida -- Elaida! -- herself cuts down Egwene.<br />It must be difficult for a writer to bring the same level of passion to the page in &quot;year 10+&quot; as it was in the beginning, so I find it hard to criticize Jordan for losing his passion.  It's understandable.  And he hasn't lost me as a reader.  I'll buy every book (the jacket is off Winter's Heart and it's waiting to be read), and read every book.  But not because I like what he's doing -- no, because I believe that he will find the passion again and make what promises to be a remarkable finish.  Tarmon Gai'don should be a conclusion to pale others that have been offered before; Covenant and Foul, for all the respect I have for Donaldson, will likely be reduced to playground scuffles.  I just hope Jordan gets there, and fast.	2001-01-19

I want to quote Dave Duncan himself...IN THE BOOK.  After the title page is one headed with: &quot;Warning&quot;.  Text follows.<br />&quot;This book, like The Gilded Chain, is a stand-alone novel.  They both cover much the same time interval and certain characters appear in both, but you can read either without reference to the other.  The same is true of the upcoming third volume, Sky of Swords.  However, the three taken together tell a larger story.  If you read any of the two, you will note certain discrepancies that can be resolved only by reading the third.&quot;<br />Duncan is a terrific storyteller.  Even without the warning, I had complete confidence in him.  An author of his stature doesn't do something like that without reasons.  I'm anxious to find out what they are.  You should be too.	2000-10-21

Donaldson: he is either reviled or adored.  As I have attached five stars to this review, I obviously fall in the category of the latter.  Admittedly, I find myself lost, and I distinctly remember when I was reading The Shadow Rising, I put it down because there was just too much information for my tiny brain to hold.  Obviously I changed my mind at some point thereafter.  I decided to wait until a few more books were published, and then I began reading them again from the beginning.  That made the difference!<br />It is the detail that impresses me the most.  Imagine for a moment living in a fantasy world where a &quot;Dark One&quot; was attempting to break free from a prison.  Would that struggle have far reaching implications, involve numerous countries, hundreds of different people, etc. etc., or would it boil down to the efforts of a few people that go on a quest to search for a talisman and defeat the bad guy?  Obviously the former.  Robert Jordan has broken free of the traditional &quot;Quest&quot; mode, and has very nearly crafted an unique niche in the fantasy market.  As much as I love the traditional heroic quest, I find myself in awe of the imagination of Robert Jordan.<br />Sure, he has a tendency to overwrite.  I have found myself thinking that he could have told the same story in one hundred fewer pages than he did.  But what he is showing us is a world struggling to remain free from their once and potential future opressor.  It may require a little overwriting.  I try to be patient, and eagerly await the ending of the series, where Rand and company (because it can't just be Rand himself...he would consumed entirely) face Shai'tan.  As much as I respect what he is doing with this story, I still have to say that I hope he wraps it up fairly quickly.  I'm interested to see what he does next.	2000-09-30

Even at the young age of 13 I was astonished and bewildered at the similarities to Tolkien.  It is certainly true that most writers of high/heroic fantasy owe a debt of gratitude to Tolkien; this series, however, owes everything to Tolkien. Greyfax Grimwald = Gandalf Greyham.  Faragon = Aragorn.  The Roots = The Ents.  I haven't read the books in 20 years, but those similarities were strong enough that I remember them still today.	2000-09-30
US	50510246	R37GN7YH4CYMPV	0395974682	669379389	The Lord of the Rings	Books	5	4	4	N	N	The Shakespeare of High Fantasy	There are a select few writers of High Fantasy who tell magnificent stories, paint striking landscapes, populate their worlds with unique and fully realized characters, and tell their tales with a humbling mastery of language.  I am a harsh critic, and count this small group (while recognizing their flaws, as all writers have) as being: Stephen R. Donaldson, Robert Jordan, Tad Williams and George R. R. Martin.<br />But towering above them all, as surely as Shakespeare towers over such masters as James Joyce, Nathaniel Hawthorne, William Faulkner, etc., is J.R.R. Tolkien.<br />LOTR is in a different class than all other so-called contenders to the throne.  It is a classic, and is the only work of High Fantasy to be universally recognized -- that is, outside the realm of fantasy -- as one of the greatest books ever written.<br />If you have grown up on Brooks, Eddings, and more recently Goodkind, you may be disappointed (note that I did not include them above!).  Do not expect to be wowed on every page, or to have magic thrust upon you at each turn.  Tolkien's magic and power is in his words.  He needs no special effects to tell his story, and that is what raises him above all the rest.  He demonstrates restraint that very few writers would be courageous enough to attempt today -- at least if they were interested in selling books.<br />But take this into account: The Lord of the Rings is *still* selling today, more than forty years after its first printing.  It is on every bookshelf of every major bookseller in America.  He did something right.  Read it, and find out for yourself.	2000-09-28

It is a mockery of epic fantasy, with tired, overworked cliches and little to no originality.  Characters in  children's novels are more original and interesting: Curious George comes  to mind.  Even worse is his writing style.  It's sophomoric and  unrealistic.  I sincerely hope that majority of readers that liked this  book were below the age of 30.  Any rational, sane adult who knows anything  about fantasy and/or writing MUST know that this is not good fiction.	2000-02-08

His characters are fresh, original and believable, and those few that fall into cliche characters etch out their own nitch.  The  ending, in To Green Angel Tower, is one of the most creative and satisfying  conclusions I have ever read.  Similar to Tolkien, in fact, and that is  high praise indeed, as Tolkien fairly well invented the genre, and, as so  many writers acknowledged, was their source of their inspiration.  Kudos to  Tad Williams.  My only disappointment was that it ended.	2000-02-08

Mr. Jordan's familiarity with his world is equalled  only by Tolkien, and on a lesser scale Donaldson.  Some of the criticisms  of his work are valid, however.  His prose is sometimes windy, but when you  take into consideration what that prose allows us to see -- a remarkably  realistic and fully realized world  -- the windiness can be forgiven.  I  have recently seen Goodkind and David Farland compared to Robert Jordan,  and these comparisons are troublesome.  In the case of Goodkind, his books  are FAR too long, and could be written in 200 pages.  Both Goodkind and  Farland's prose is choppy, and the dialogue and reactions of the characters  are unrealistic.  Even if you enjoy the above mentioned authors, arguing  those points would be difficult.  Jordan's works are fertile and complex.   What is most amazing to me is that this is perhaps the only series where  &quot;magic&quot; (Aes Sedai, One Power, etc.) fertilizes the tapestry of  the book throughout the entire series, and is still believable.  There are  no &quot;wizards&quot; with staffs that hurl fire or lightning, and the  artifiacts that he does emply (ter' angreal, etc.) are unique and tangible.   This is the only series I have encountered, with the singular exception of  Tolkien, that was so tangible that it nearly reads like exciting and  creative non-fiction.<br />The only other authors that I consider worthy of  mention in comparison with Jordan (in this genre) are Donaldson and Tad  Williams.  George R. R. Martin's first two books of his recent series, if  he finishes as well as he has begun, could be added to that list as well.	2000-02-08
US	50510246	R3OA7Z5GV646QM	0345348680	75353792	The Wounded Land (The Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, Book 1)	Books	5	11	12	N	N	A Remarkably Creative Follow-Up	Whereas many follow ups to successful first works seem to be written purely as a vehicle to squeeze another dollar out of a good idea (see Terry Brooks' second go with the Shannara series and David Eddings' Mallorean),  this beginning of the Second Chronicles logically follows the First.  I  read this book many years ago, and am as impressed with the concept of a  &quot;Wounded Land&quot; now as I was then.  Some refer to this work as  &quot;Dark Fantasy&quot;.  I see it more as realism...within the scope of a  fantasy setting, of course.  Donaldson has a feel and touch to &quot;The  Land&quot;, an affiliation so natural that his third person omniscient  sounds exactly so.  Upon reaching the end of this trilogy--The White Gold  Wielder--it is obvious that the story has not yet reached completion.  We  can't hold our breath, as it has been some 16 years since White Gold  Wielder was published, but we can bid our time.  As impatient as it seems,  at times....	2000-01-26
