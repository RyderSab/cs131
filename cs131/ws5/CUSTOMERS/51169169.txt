In James Frey's first book, the writing style was appropriate to the content. The sparse prose and lack of respect for writing rules complimented his approach to recovery, which was to disregard the 12 Steps and not recognize a Higher Power.<br /><br />In this, his second book, the style gets old quickly. The run on sentences are not effective, but annoying, and I had to reread several passages to keep up with the story. This is the story of Frey's life after the rehab clinic, including a short stint in prison, a life in Chicago where he frequents bars and watches his friends get drunk and a life in Los Angeles where he chooses to raise pit bulls and tries to make a go of it in the film industry. All the while, he hangs onto a friendship with a mobster, Leonard, who drops into his life and keeps him fed. Leonard is his security blanket.<br /><br />I took the advice of one Amazon reviewer and didn't read the last page of A Million Little Pieces where the author summarizes the futures of his rehab pals, so reading My Friend Leonard was, perhaps more interesting without the \\"plot spoilers\\" contained there. But had I gone into this book knowing more about Lilly or Leonard, there's no way I would have finished it.<br /><br />Through these two books, Frey has succeeded in getting me interested in his life, his good health and his career. What I hope to see in his next book is a more developed and well-rounded writing style.<br /><br />From the author of \\"I'm Living Your Dream Life,\\" and \\"The Things I Wish I'd Said,\\" McKenna Publishing Group.	2005-10-13

That is what I am and who I am and that is how I should be remembered. No happy lies, no invented memories, no fake sentimentality, no tears.\\"<br /><br />The above quotation from \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" perfectly describes both the author and the content of this book, which is the story of one man's journey down the road to recovery. Presented without sentimentality, limited punctuation and straightforward arrogance, it paints a vivid picture of bottom-of-the-barrel addiction. Reading it made me woozy. I felt both intoxicated and sick to my stomach. I felt his pain, agony, fear, hunger, Fury, irreverence, self-loathing and, most poignantly, his strength.<br /><br />If you know nothing about addiction, this will help you understand where and how it begins. As the author recounts his Family sessions at the clinic, you can BE the parent hearing terrible things your child admits to you--things you may have suspected, but never knew were happening. Some of us know alcoholics and addicts and know that the likely outcomes of this behavior are either prison or death. For the fortunate, there's rehab and for the few (the 17% who, according to the clinic counselors portrayed in this book, stay sober for a year after they leave) recovery. Bucking the system--refusing to accept God or a Higher Power, deriding the Twelve Steps, refusing advice on (nearly) everything with a youthful and odious irreverence, James Frey adds an entirely personal and educational dimension to the topic. He tries to make the reader understand that alcoholism/addiction is an equal-opportunity disease (although he may argue that it's not a disease) and recovery is completely up to the individual. In spite of his despicable nature, we root for him. We can't help but wish him and every character in this story well.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2005-10-10

It is beautifully told though the eyes of the Redlich family: Walter, a former attorney, Jettel, his beautiful and emotional wife, Regina, the precocious, intelligent and receptive child, and Owuor, their African \\"houseboy\\" or cook. With the purple Ngong hills of Kenya, the famous Norfolk hotel and the pink-flamingo-covered Lake Nakuru in the background, this autobiographical account tells a unique tale of the suffering and pain inflicted upon this family, forced into exile by the actions of the Nazi regime.<br /><br />The Redlich family was lucky enough to escape their beloved homeland, but not all members of their families shared the same fate. As she tells the story of a proud family losing everything, particularly social status and an understandable language, Stefanie Zweig uses a variety of languages to describe their myriad and varying emotions. Translated into English from German, this version loses a little bit of the importance of language barrier to the tale; however, Swahili, German and even a few Latin phrases are peppered throughout and do help.<br /><br />Regina, Zweig's alter ego, is the strongest and most enjoyable voice. In fact, I wished the entire story were told through her perspective, for she is the one who most captures the spirit of Kenya. This is primarily due to Regina's relationship with Owuor, and her own secret fairy, that guides her through lonely experiences at boarding school, a luxury her refugee parents can barely afford. Even though she is a child, she becomes the voice of reason for the entire family.<br /><br />If you've spent any time in Kenya, this book will bring your experience back to life and make you further appreciate the distinctions of class, race and ethnic heritage. I highly recommend.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2005-09-30

Listening to Barbara Kingsolver's soothing, lilting voice recite these personal and brilliant poems in the audio version of \\"Another America\\" made a long day's drive through the desert a deep and meaningful experience.<br /><br />Her opening essay, outlining her take on how to call oneself a \\"poet\\" and how society judges poetry in terms of importance/relevance, was a thought provoking piece for anyone valuing poetry as an art or form of self-expression. Following the essay, her poems are presented in five sections, each separated by acoustic guitars playing with a south-of-the-border flair.<br /><br />Through her poetry, Kingsolver gives much of her soul. It's her most beautiful writing. It ranges from trite and funny observations, \\"What the Janitor Heard in the Elevator,\\" and, one of my favorites written from the perspective of a one-year-old, \\"Baby Blues,\\" which made me laugh out loud, to the raw and gritty, \\"Street Scenes,\\" to the deeply moving and personal. \\"This House I Cannot Leave,\\" and \\"Ten Forty-Four,\\" made me shake with emotion. Through these two poems in particular, she turns horror into beauty with true grace. The collection ends with \\"Your Mother's Eyes,\\" which like many, was a personal dedication.<br /><br />I will listen to this tape again and again and use it to share the beauty of poetry with those I love. This would make a wonderful gift for an artistic, intelligent friend.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2005-09-28

I set aside the novel and didn't set down Eleven Days of Hell until I finished it.<br /><br />As a memoir fan, in the opening chapters I enjoyed getting to know the diverse and ambitious character that is Yvonne. (I could almost hear her Australian accent.) And then, as the book progressed and she and her husband were abducted, each of the 11 days of torture and uncertainty is carefully and descriptively laid bare. The story proved fascinating, unique and had me at the edge of my seat. Through the first person accounts, (presented in Roman type as opposed to the intermingling third-person narratives presented in italics), the reader experiences terror through the eyes of the victim and this is the strongest aspect of the book.<br /><br />A truly riveting story, I highly recommend reading Eleven Days in Hell.<br /><br />From the author of \\"I'm Living Your Dream Life,\\" and \\"The Things I Wish I'd Said,\\" McKenna Publishing Group.	2005-09-18

(Think Brigit Jones Diary). In some work this blatant self-loathing can seem contrived, peppered in to hide the flavor of an otherwise arrogant, irreverent, and self-absorbed protagonist; however, while Susan Jane Gilman can come across as all of the above in her memoir, `Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress,\\" in no way is any of it contrived. It's real. It's brutally honest, laugh-out-loud funny and very original. I enjoyed reading every page of this well-crafted collection.<br /><br />The chapters read like long columns--better yet, like short stories. Her tales start with a premise, ramble on so that you don't exactly know where they're going but you are nonetheless thoroughly entertained, and then BAM! She brings you right back to the point and leaves you smiling. I particularly enjoyed the tale about Mick Jagger and the congresswoman named \\"Minnie.\\" I believe, however, her true character was revealed through \\"Picnic at Treblinka,\\" where she tells the story of a week in Poland (as a reporter for The Jewish Week) visiting concentration camps--true character, by the way, that wasn't even remotely hypocritical.<br /><br />I recommend this book and look forward to reading more by this talented author.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2005-08-22

It has the feel of an average Saturday, in spite of the outset as he witnesses a plane crash over the dark skies of London; however, Perowne's deep contemplation in this post-9/11 world, makes it, and consequently this brief story, anything but ordinary. Saturday contains the musings of a common, albeit brilliant man, put forth in McEwan's masterful writing style, and make this Saturday, this book, extraordinary and life-changing.<br /><br />McEwan's research is exact (my brother-in-law, a neurosurgeon, confirmed this) and during a procedure, I felt like I was in the room, witnessing each step, smelling the surgical odors, hearing the music in the background. Each character is fully developed and presented with great respect. Further, the subject of terror--central to the story--is not only discussed, it's illustrated.<br /><br />I give this book my highest recommendation.

The woman, Rachel, doesn't strike me as physically attractive, she's snobby, depressed, totally irreverent towards just about everyone and everything, and the blunt sexual descriptions of acts performed by not only her but also by the story's secondary characters (who all, by the way, seemed like the same character with different names and different jobs) were a real turn-off.<br /><br />HOWEVER, there was something gut wrenching and real about the writing that kept me turning the pages very quickly. Lisa Glatt gets into the heads of her characters and exposes their deepest secrets and their most profound fears. She ultimately succeeds with this story by putting cancer right out there and shows us what it's like to live with someone you love who is disappearing before your very eyes.<br /><br />Well into the book she uses a metaphor for cancer that I will never forget. She compares it to driving down a one-way street. Brilliant.<br /><br />For anyone who has lost a loved-one, particularly a mother (whether or not to cancer) this book will be difficult.

Woodward and Bernstein's reporting was used as a standard of excellence in my first high school journalism class and ultimately led me to obtaining a degree in this field. I've followed the Watergate saga ever since and always had a passing interest in the identity of Deep Throat. When this source was finally revealed a few months back, I'm glad I didn't have to wait too long for Bob Woodward's take on the revelation.<br /><br />The Secret Man did not disappoint. It's like the final chapter to the story. Woodward reveals intimate feelings about his days as a young reporter and how he feels today about being a part of what turned out to be the most important story of the century. His integrity as a journalist, his humanity, his compassion and intelligence shine through in this succinct account of how he met Mark Felt (aka Deep Throat) and pursued him as a source on the Watergate ordeal. Felt was his mentor, and like Ben Bradlee at the Washington Post, another father figure.<br /><br />The strongest part of this book is Woodward's account of his meeting with Felt in Santa Rosa, CA in February 2000, when it became apparent that Felt was suffering from dementia. As a result of this meeting Woodward faced the troubling notion that he may never have the journalist's most important question answered: WHY did Felt do it. What was his true motivation?<br /><br />Carl Bernstein includes a brief assessment in the end, rounding out this superstar team's account of the now solved mystery of Deep Throat. \\"The reporters had to set his or her own course,\\" he writes, \\"had to push back against editors at times, to roam and be free to explore, to defy the conventional wisdom if necessary. . . (reporters) had to find the inside stories, get to the bottom of things . . .\\"<br /><br />I, for one, am grateful that Woodward and Bernstein found Deep Throat and got to the bottom of the Watergate story.

It is my first \\"horror\\" novel and while I'm not sure it has convinced me to take up this genre, I must say it has made me a fan of the author.  Jack Priest certainly knows how to weave a tale. It's clever, hip and, well, gory as can be--everything I've ever imagined a horror story to be and a bit more.<br /><br />Set among a clan of bootleggers in the music industry, the tale initially unfolds through an adventure in Australia where the main characters, Rick and Ann Gordon, learn about Aboriginal lore of the Marangit (good) vs. the Galka (evil). Evil takes the form of the Ragged Man, a heartless killer intent on beheading everyone on a long list of bootleggers associated with Rick Gordon. The Ragged Man, also known as Sam Storm, has a saber-toothed familiar, a killing creature also known as the Ghost Dog. Between the two of them ravaging the bootlegger's world, the blood never stops spilling. Besides off-road racing in the Australian desert, there are further adventures on an airplane, bikes, a fishing boat, several cars and even a bathtub.<br /><br />Late in the story there's a moment of remorse that emerges from Storm, when he realizes he has done \\"terrible things, foul unspeakable deeds, things against the laws of God and Man, things that violated his very nature.\\" He goes on to admit that wrong as they were, he enjoyed doing them. I laughed, thinking such sentiment was similar to how I felt about reading this book. I enjoy a good mystery from time to time, can even stomach a romance, but I never thought I'd enjoy reading a story about a crazed killer. Obviously this is the result of a talented storyteller and I look forward to reading more of his work.<br /><br />From the author of \\"I'm Living Your Dream Life,\\" and \\"The Things I Wish I'd Said,\\" McKenna Publishing Group	2005-07-25

It is masterfully written, showing the author's true grasp of the always beautiful and sometimes harsh world around her. One feels the cold, hears the wind, smells the livestock, tastes the home-cooked meals . . . The writing is lyrical and smart, and overall, this memoir provides a lifetime of intimate details from the memory of \\"baby-boomer,\\" Judy Blunt.<br /><br />Even though the story is set in Montana and paints a clear picture of ranch life, it is also, in effect, the story of every woman growing up during this turbulent time period . . . in the emergence of the feminine mystique . . . particularly women who married young and tried to assume the roles of their mothers (or mothers-in law.) In a land and a time where gender roles were clearly defined, the author learns to find her way, always feeling like an outsider both when she moves \\"to town\\" as a high school freshman, and throughout her days living on the fringes of American society before technology reached the frontier. In spite of never having visited Montana and not knowing anything about ranch life, I related to Judy Blunt through this wonderful memoir, \\"Breaking Clean.\\" This is book was a delight to read.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2005-07-22

This is not only a story I \\"get,\\" (couple flees city for a life in the country) it's full of a self-deprecating and sarcastic wit I welcome when reading memoirs.<br /><br />Jim Mullen, a humor columnist best known for his \\"Hot Sheet\\" in Entertainment Weekly, portrays Manhattan life as addiction. Addiction, for example, to non-stop action, Broadway plays, gallery openings, ethnic restaurants and The New York Times. The symptoms include immunity to noise and smells, and they lead to chain-smoking and excessive spending at The Sharper Image. He's hooked. It's his wife, Sue, who takes the lead and buys a farm three hours northwest of the city in the Catskills, and drags him along for what turn out to be rehabilitative weekends. As the weekends grow from two days to five and then finally full time, he gives up smoking, takes up bicycling and then learns about everything from growing giant pumpkins to the inner workings of a septic system. One realizes he has come full circle when he describes a dewy spider web as the prettiest thing he's ever seen and recognizes a \\"flatlander\\" in the garden store. While observing this newer version of the village idiot, he rolls his eyes and wonders if that's how he was when he first entered (the fictional town of) Walleye.<br /><br />The writing is original and funny, informal without being glib, irreverent without being vulgar. For anyone who enjoys well-written memoirs--particularly those of the city-mouse, country mouse variety--put this on your list.

After devouring this fascinating study of human nature as portrayed by countless characters created in popular literature--from Shakespeare to Salinger, Hawthorne to Hardy, Kerouac to Kingsolver--I believe it has helped to give new and extended meaning to nearly every story I've ever read.<br /><br />There is thoughtful organization to the chapters as each introduces the sub-topic in a very clever and readable way. Through the work of Jane Austen we learn what women want and why. Through Othello, we become more sensitive to male insecurities. The authors use the Corleone family (The Godfather) to introduce the importance of genetics, shared DNA, and branch out to examine various familial relationships. By revisiting the life of Holden Caulfield the parent-child relationship is examined. Sibling relationships take center stage through Cain and Abel, Steinbeck's East of Eden and the daughters of King Lear; and step-parent/child dynamics ring true through the examples of David Copperfield and Cosette and Jean Valjean in Victor Hugo's Les Miserables. Even young Harry Potter gets a mention in this section. Each topic is packed with examples (at times too many, belaboring the point); however, it never fails to bring the reader back to basic biology: the birds and the bees.<br /><br />This is a well researched and fun read. The authors show deep respect not only for the extensive list of books/authors cited but also for the readers who \\"consume novels and plays, seeking sustenance along with pleasure.\\" Using classic works to advance their theories, \\"Madame Bovary's Ovaries,\\" is put forth as a tool to help readers more deeply enjoy reading by understanding and relating to a shared human experience.<br /><br />The readers know why.<br /><br />I highly recommend the read and my hat is off to this father-daughter writing team.

This book is so well written, with such likeable characters, it was hard to put down. Lolly Winston takes a serious topic, the death of a loved one, and actually makes it humorous. As we grieve with the sympathetic main character, a bumbling Lucille Ball-type comedienne, she helps us understand how such a difficult loss can really turn one's world upside down.<br /><br />Using the grief process as an outline for the chapters of this book, denial, anger, depression, bargaining and finally, acceptance, we experience the life of Sophie Stanton in the year immediately following her husband's death. She spends some time in grief groups and is not afraid to take advice and try to move forward, never letting you forget the weight of her loss. And while attending a group session, she learns from the counselor: \\"It's a myth that people experience grief for a certain amount of time and then they're over it.\\" I think this is the most important message contained within the pages of this quick and witty read.<br /><br />And I do mean witty. Winston has a wonderful way with words. For example, through the first person narrative of her main character she deduces that \\"tears are to a grief counselor what straight teeth are to an orthodontist.\\" Each chapter is filled with fresh dialog and truthful, heartfelt observations.

The tale is neither extraordinary nor suspenseful, and this book will not change your life. \\"Lost in the Forest,\\" the newest book by Sue Miller is, however, well worth reading.<br /><br />The characters consist of a small, modern family living in the Napa Valley. Each is so well drawn, at first it's difficult to tell whom will be the central figure. Is it Mark--the divorced father of two? Eva, the mother of his daughters who has just lost her second husband in a tragic accident? Or is it their second-born daughter, Daisy, a tall and troubled young lady trying to find her way? Even the secondary characters, Emily, the eldest daughter; Theo, the seemingly oblivious little boy, scion of John, Eva's dead husband; Gracie and Duncan, family friends, are prominent and important. There is nothing excessive in this quick and compelling read.<br /><br />Miller is a master not only at character development, but also at dialog. She is brave in her use of language--knowing how people actually talk and conveying how they truly FEEL. I have to say I was disturbed during a Lolita-like sex scene but mostly because it was so very real; however, it helped make a correspondence from Daisy in her later years extremely poignant and meaningful: \\"Well, there are some people who when they draw the line are left standing there with only the line to keep them company.\\"<br /><br />The story moves artfully through time, back and forth, and allows the reader to know this family and what holds them together and pushes them apart.

This novel has everything I crave: Plot, mystery, well-drawn, eccentric characters, RIDDLES, history, art, lyrical and descriptive prose. I was transported to New England while following the unfolding story of Caroline Wharton as discovered by the somewhat reluctant biographer, Michelle Trutor.<br /><br />Through her main character, Debbie Lee Wesselmann paints Trutor's subject as an \\"intellectual enigma\\" and the owner of souls. As she unravels the \\"sticky web\\" left behind by Caroline, a woman who committed suicide and virtually imprisoned her family (the \\"Balloonist,\\" Arthur, and his twin brother, Proctor, and their niece, Roberta) in a former mortuary, she offers riddles that one can't help but try to solve before reading further.  The clever riddles pull you through this fascinating story of complicated relationships.<br /><br />Because of a convoluted will and a watchful attorney, Trutor was the only one who had access to the clues Caroline had left behind, which included her personal journals. I particularly enjoyed the journal entries, which intimately portray the creative and multifarious soul that was Caroline Wharton. My favorite entry: \\"I spent hours reading today here in the Botanical Gardens before I felt the need to write myself: the small leap from someone else's words to my own like a garden shading from lavender to deep purple.\\"<br /><br />Deep purple indeed. This novel deserves the royal treatment and my highest recommendation.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2005-06-16

An example of \\"show-don't-tell\\" writing: \\"I have to have a purse large enough so that if Nazis were advancing into my village, I'd have enough room to shove half of my household belongings in there and a bunch of snacks for the trip. It's that big.\\" (Can't you just see it?)<br /><br />The stories vary in length, from pithy column-like accounts of why she \\"hates Kate Winslet\\" to more drawn out storytelling about a computer game known as \\"The Sims\\" and the title story, \\"I Love Everybody,\\" which is a funny and honest take on her own personality. We get to experience her QVC-addicted mother and her lovable, nutty nana, who is hooked on Lifetime Television. Everyone and everything is fair game. And since I'm a former newspaper columnist, I especially appreciated her accounts of dealing with new editors and the implicit documentary-type tale of the evolution of her career from columnist to bestselling author.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for all readers, particularly those who appreciate first-person collections like those of David Sedaris, Sandra Tsing Loh, Augusten Burroughs, to name a few. Male or female, again a good sense of humor and an appreciation of witty, well-crafted writing makes this book for you.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2005-06-10

Naomi Wolf shares her father's poetic wisdom, lesson by lesson, by recounting a summer spent building a tree house with her children, her friends, and of course, her father, Leonard. As she looks to him for advice on how to build this metaphorical house, she opens herself to his wisdom in helping her to become a better teacher. She, in turn, teaches us. The Treehouse is a book that should be read by every aspiring writer.<br /><br />Each lesson begins with a description of what Leonard is wearing, from a yellow rain slicker like Paddington Bear, to an \\"intellectual-in-the-1970s outfit,\\" to a red flannel Basque shepherd's shirt and Argentine gaucho hat, and also tells what strange (or conventional) brew he is drinking. In addition to his outfits, Wolf's descriptive writing allows us to see his thick white eyebrows dance with expression and hear his voice as he lyrically speaks in quotes from Thoreau, Emerson, Chaucer, Dickenson, etc. Throughout the lessons, Wolf lapses into memoir, recounting her San Francisco childhood, and a small bit about her rise to fame after the publication of \\"The Beauty Myth,\\" but only because it helps to explain the person she had become in spite of (or perhaps, because of) her father. Even more interesting is the biographic account of her father's bohemian life.<br /><br />In the final lesson, as Leonard teaches the need to own your creative work, to \\"sign it and let it go,\\" to me, the words that spoke the loudest were: \\"Once the work is out in the world, it is none of your business what your readers make of it.\\" Again, wonderful advice for writers.  As for reviewers . . .<br /><br />I felt the need to review this book and give it my highest recommendation.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2005-06-08

I didn't want it to end. I'm exhausted--feeling like I just danced my way through a weekend of shows--and yet, so high on the memories, I'm thrilled and honored to write this review. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Phil, for writing \\"Searching For The Sound.\\" It's a wonderful book. The best I've read about the Dead. Thank you for sharing everything behind that omnipresent smile you always seemed to have on stage.<br /><br />Our intimate circle of Deadhead cohorts--best friends, pals, passing and long-term acquaintances that began in Southern Illinois (particularly along with the fabulous and memorable cover group, \\"Uncle Jon's Band,\\") through our crew called \\"East Bay Deadheads For Peace\\" formed during one of many Berkeley Greek Theater shows, always called Phil \\"The Professor.\\" I confess I never knew why until I read this book. Wow. Phil brings an intellectual integrity to the story of his own musical education and, of course, to the band--to the history of the music driving The Grateful Dead, and to all of us who continually flocked to see them play for us and for each other. Phil lets us in. Tells us what it was REALLY like. Even when I knew what was coming, I experienced the pains (and the joys) through a different and certainly wiser set of eyes. This book is written with true love and deep respect for all members of the band and above all, for THE MUSIC.<br /><br />What amazes me most about his book is the clarity of Phil's memory. He recounts (particularly the early days) with such detail that I can't help but believe this is transcribed from personal journals. Passages like: \\"the whole urban symphony of Industrial Man, coming from near and far, high and low, finally weaving a shimmering web of discontinuous rhythm, and in the longest slow fade ever, subsiding over hours to a dull roar, felt rather than heard, only to rouse itself anew as the sky brightened with the light of another day.\\" Whew! This amazing, true, brutally honest, funny, insightful memoir is full of such . . . such . . . stuff! And it's not just trippy memory-packed description that blew me away. When he describes the \\"dark and stormy night\\" that defined their Woodstock experience, he describes the faltering sound-system as an electrical edifice with \\"a saber-toothed crotch cricket of a hum.\\"<br /><br />To anyone who not only experienced the phenomenon that was (is) the Grateful Dead, and particularly to those who appreciate the value of music, I highly, highly recommend this read. I haven't felt this emotional over a book in a long, long time. I love you, Phil.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said., true, brutally honest, funny, insightful memoir is full of such . . . such . . . stuff!

She travels from her comfortable Atlanta home and twenty-year marriage to South Carolina's Egret Island of her youth to try and discover why her mother has chopped off her finger. By opting to stay, she pursues a love affair with monk named Brother Thomas, a resident of the island's monastery, separates from her husband and discovers her inner artist. Through a band of colorful characters, friends of her mother, she also discovers the truth of her father's death. Ultimately, she experiences a metamorphosis, bringing the story full circle.<br /><br />More than a midlife crisis, I loved this book. I particularly loved reading it on May 17.

Yes, you guessed it, there's a Mike in my life. And after reading this past and present story of a woman \\"torn between two lovers and feelin' like a fool,\\" I'm happy to report there's only ONE Mike in MY life. Thank goodness.<br /><br />This is a fun little story. A quick read with, and I'm not kidding, a laugh on every page. The main character, Beau, is a great combination of self-confidence and self-deprecation and speaks to the reader as though conversing with a confidant. She's brutally honest as she outlines the life of suburban housewife, and I found myself laughing out loud at some of the same things I've not only thought but also actually said myself.<br /><br />Wendy Markham, you paint a clear picture here, tell a story very well and have provided a fine piece of entertainment. I particularly like the way you never truly let on which Mike Beau marries until the fast-paced ending. There was, however, a major hint early on that enabled me to guess (correctly), and it left me satisfied and smiling.

Extremely well crafted and well written, it's a tough one to put down.<br /><br />It's not everyday that you read about a seven-year old girl who exhibits symptoms of stigmata, talks to (a female) God and has miracles follow in her path. And she's only the most interesting character of many. Picoult rounds out the story and broadens interest by making the little girl, Faith, of Jewish heritage. She brings in the Roman Catholic Church and a television atheist, a couple of high-powered attorneys, a philandering father and Prozac mother, along with a colorful, outspoken grandmom.<br /><br />A great read.

She has transferred her wisdom into a brief and easy-to-read message book, which provides great advice to all who are mired in what can be a very judgmental society.<br /><br />The premise of this book, the reprint of a graduation speech, is the suggestion that we don't forget or ignore our true selves as we strive to conform to what society believes is perfection. Quindlen reminds us that it's okay to be different and that our best selves and most creative ideas may come from these differences.<br /><br />Like Maria Shriver's new book, \\"And One More Thing Before You Go,\\" I believe this is the perfect graduation gift, particularly for girls or young women, but should not be limited to this audience.

While reading it, other \\"middle-aged women\\" who saw me carrying it couldn't help but ask if it is was any good. I stayed with it, always hoping, but my response to the is it any good question was and is, \\"not really.\\"<br /><br />The main character, Rose, is compelling and well drawn. She has the reader's empathy and one can't help but root for her throughout the tale. The title is a tease and perhaps it's because I'm not as sophisticated (or as British) as she, but I kept hoping for something juicy. I wondered how Rose--don't call me \\"Rosie\\"--would ultimately get back at the kitten-heeled slut who stole her husband, job and home--not to mention the namby-pam fool she had married. Sadly, I was disappointed. To use the author's words in ultimately describing Rose's life as a survivor, I found the reading experience to be \\"ordinary and unremarkable.\\"<br /><br />A note on the writing style: It reads quickly, however, there are flashbacks interrupting the story giving it a choppy feel and often I had to reread sections of dialog to figure out who was speaking.<br /><br />Finally, the extra half star is because the overall premise of the book felt a little like a wakeup call. Like Rose, I believe I have a happy, stable marriage. As a result of reading this book, I will certainly not take that for granted. For this, thanks are due to Elizabeth Buchan.

While the author seemed to dive into lives of her clients far more than I would ever consider, it's clear she did so with the purpose of studying human nature. To call her \\"grumpy\\" or even resentful by exposing these stories in the book, critics fail to see the pure entertainment value of this quick, little read.<br /><br />On the other hand, I've had weekly cleaning ladies enter my personal home(s) for many, many years. Through Louise Rafkin's book, I have learned how to keep anything truly personal, personal.  For example, you bet I strip my own bed lest anyone attempt to get an inside look at my sex life!!!<br /><br />Particularly because of the controversy and strong reader reactions it has caused, I think this book is a gem and I highly recommend.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, author of I'm Living Your Dream Life: The Story of a Northwoods Resort Owner	2005-04-19

The title, \\"A New Dish,\\" is from the last poem in the collection, where the author explains that words call out to her and beg her to get them onto paper (or put them in a pretty dish) before time passes and the words will be different. It beautifully wraps up this collection.<br /><br />Much of it is in the moment. There's observational poetry and story telling--how she once got on the wrong car of a train and begrudged the woman who took \\"her\\" seat--and vivid description of the world around her. There's an even mixture of angst and strength and many poems expressing love and gratitude. It's a portrait of growth.<br /><br />Mostly a collection of free verse poetry, I found a few of the more traditional (iambic pentameter) entries (\\"This is Who I Am\\") to be particularly strong.

A Legitimate BOOK Review	I have just spent several days reading \\"My Life So Far,\\" and that's what it will take to get to know the real Jane Fonda through her own eyes and this effort. This is a long book, an autobiography packed with detail covering every phase of her life. It is written in an easy, readable voice and from this reviewer's perspective, comes straight from the heart. I defy anyone not to call the willingness to portray one's innermost feelings and experiences--both controversial and mainstream--a brave act.<br /><br />Jane Fonda didn't ask to be born into the glare of the public eye, but rather she was thrust there by means of a famous father who was emotionally unavailable. Further, she faced painful, everyday esteem issues and her mother's suicide while the world watched and judged. She suffered from bulimia, and what she describes later in the book (through the words of Oprah Winfrey), \\"the disease to please.\\" Some can and have called it whining, however, in a memoir it is more accurately described as self-study and portrayal. In the end Fonda learns to \\"inhabit herself.\\" You don't have to like her to read this book. If you enjoy reading memoirs of fascinating people, this one fills the bill.<br /><br />Reading this book allows one to contemplate many life issues. I thought about my own parents and siblings; growing up and fitting in; first sexual experiences; friendships; exercise; marriage; childbirth; religion; social work and my attitude towards the Viet Nam war. (Her trip to Hanoi and the aftermath--so sensationalized and misconstrued--unfolds with interesting detail and explains her motivations in a riveting fashion). But what I found particularly interesting was her insider's perspective to making movies. I always wondered how actors could pull off love scenes and Fonda gives the emotional and physical details of one of her most important and noted love scenes, with Jon Voigt in \\"Coming Home.\\"<br /><br />Her second act is by far the most interesting. By the time Ted Turner comes into the picture, I couldn't help but wonder how, given everything she had revealed thus far, she could have fallen for such a man. She gave up her movie career--not necessarily because of him but because she was ready to retire--and adopted another new role dedicating her time to various social causes including the important issue of population stabilization and the foundation of G-CAPP (Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention). I think ultimately the third act depicts an extremely ambitious, motivated and generous chameleon of a woman who has never hesitated to stop learning about herself and the world.<br /><br />One error that really jumped out is when Fonda attributes the quote describing Oakland, CA, \\"There is no there, there,\\" to Dorothy Parker, when the quote actually came from Gertrude Stein. While not serious enough to undermine her credibility, her editor may want to give that a second look.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.picture, I couldn't help but wonder how, given everything she had revealed thus far, she could have fallen for such a man.

Mothers of these daughters will also benefit by reading this, especially if they subscribe to Shriver's suggestion that we all \\"stay teachable.\\"<br /><br />A quick read, it's fun, pithy, occasionally self-deprecating (Shriver isn't afraid to admit her own mistakes) and never condescending.

It is well written, funny, insightful and truthful. Mostly, however, it is relatable. Anyone with sisters--make that siblings--will relate to the feelings expressed and the stories told by this gifted author. While her focus is on the relationship(s) between four sisters who have a fifteen-year age spread, it is also about their sole brother, their unique parents and the author's son. It reads a lot like a novel, but I found it so much more enjoyable knowing these are real characters existing in a loving and tight-knit family. I became so interested in them that half way through the book I contacted the author through her website and asked her to identify each character as pictured on book cover of the hardback edition.<br /><br />The reason I was so interested in them? The author writes with deep respect and a fearless honesty. Every story--even those about arguments--is awash with love. Debra Ginsberg allows the reader into her family and makes it a comfortable place to be. What's truly interesting about that is I don't think I'd be comfortable actually sitting with them during one of their many raucous family gatherings . . . but being the fly on wall was a fun place for me.<br /><br />I purchased this book because of having similar family dynamics. I, too, am one of four girls in a family with a lone brother--making us five with a ten year spread. Unlike the author, however, I'm not the eldest of the tribe and don't possess her wisdom and knowledge of every phase of the family's changing traits. (I'm number four; however, I'm about the same age as the author AND I have a sister named Debra.) By reading the description of this book I knew immediately it was for me. I wasn't disappointed in the least and read it very quickly. Now I want each of my sisters to read it. (I'd suggest my brother read it too if he enjoyed reading anything other than the sports pages of the daily newspaper). In fact, I can see giving it as a gift to several girlfriends who have sisters.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you appreciate fine writing and good story telling, you'll love this book. Even if you don't have sisters.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.o several girlfriends who have sisters.

I'm a fan of Carrie Fisher's previous work, particularly because she has an uncanny sense of wordplay and a quick wit that makes reading a snappy joy. And while \\"The Best Awful\\" certainly showcases her talents and gives the \\"sane\\" reader a sense of \\"crazy,\\" I'm not sure I was that interested.<br /><br />Suzanne Vale, Fisher's alter ego, spirals down the polar measure of what is acceptable vs. what is unacceptable behavior so quickly it's easy to get wrapped up in her misadventures without really understanding why it's happening. Why does a bipolar patient decide to go off medication? We may know the pat, clinical reasons; however, I feel this book had the chance to truly explain it. Fisher tries to do that and succeeds by getting us inside the head of Suzanne, but I was left wanting. I found, much to my surprise, that I rooted for the character because she's a celebrity with famous parents-not because she's a likable character and, forgive me, a disastrous mother. Simply put, I'm tired of this culture's overblown fascination with celebrities. I can't stand the way society builds them up and revels in the idea of knocking them off the very pedestals we've built. It's so boring.<br /><br />I can't blame Carrie Fisher for this. She didn't ask to be in the position she was born into. And this is what I admire about her. In spite of her illness, she continually shows amazing strength and resolve and provides us with an entertaining look inside her unusual brain. There's brilliant wordplay on just about every page of \\"The Best Awful\\" and that's why I stayed with it until the bitter end.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2005-04-01

It took me a few weeks to read, not necessarily because it's long, but because it's packed full of description and mystery, and has the ability to absolutely transport the reader to another time and place. In this case, it's the English village of Wigan, a dank coalmining town on the outskirts of London in the year 1872.<br /><br />We're introduced to the village and the main characters through the malarial eyes of a misfit named Blair, who although he was born in Wigan, is viewed as an outsider. He is mocked and scorned at every turn. Through keen intelligence and persistence, he solves the mysteries on an equal footing with the reader, and in the end, I was left completely satisfied.<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend this book, particularly for readers who enjoy crime mysteries but also for those who like a good, well-written and well-researched period piece.<br /><br />From the author of \\"I'm Living Your Dream Life,\\" and \\"The Things I Wish I'd Said,\\" McKenna Publishing Group.	2005-03-26

It was on page 311--long after I figured out who the \\"love story\\" would actually be about--when a bell went off and I realized this was the story of a more self-righteous rather than self-loathing version of Bridget Jones.<br /><br />Olivia's sarcasm grows old as soon as the meat of the story is revealed: when she is selected as guardian to her half-sister, a three-year old brat named Celia, who is orphaned when Olivia's father and step mother are killed in a car crash. Olivia's complete lack of respect for her dead father, her living but drunk, ex-model mother, her Don Juan of an instructor who she lets take her virginity, and virtually every other satellite character, make it difficult to root for her. Yes, she's smart. Apparently, she's pretty. Sure, she didn't have good role models as parents and is expected to be a good role model as she essentially plays parent to her little sister, but I found her to be a highly unlikable know-it-all.<br /><br />I'd like to meet her again on her fortieth birthday.<br /><br />Again, I'll watch for future work by this talented author. Thank you for the opportunity to review \\"Same As It Never Was.\\"	2005-02-10
US	51169169	R2XYRWZGT9L6JD	0316781487	223736820	Light on Snow	Books	5	5	6	N	N	A book for those who appreciate FINE writing	I think several of these reviews are too harsh and feel the word \\"disappointment\\" is overused and inappropriate. No matter how many novels an author has produced for our reading pleasure, when it comes to reviews, I believe work should be judged on its own merit.<br /><br />That said, I believe this fine author tells a sad and simple story. Light on Snow is exactly that: A simple story about simple people in a complicated situation. It's told through the reflective and wise first-person voice of a woman looking back on something extraordinary that happened to her when she was twelve-years old, and from start to finish, I was engrossed with not only the story, but the character study.<br /><br />This story could be about any of our neighbors. These characters are not uncommon or bizarre, but very real and quite compelling. I couldn't help but wonder how I might respond to finding an abandoned baby or how I would feel if my mother and baby sister were recently killed in an automobile accident and I was left behind, broken and lost. Shreve's storytelling evokes empathy and is truly artistic.<br /><br />Overall, I feel the writing is concise, flows well and paints beautiful scenery of a cold and icy New Hampshire winter. It reads very quickly and is a worthy effort. Also recommend: \\"I Capture The Castle,\\" by Dodie Smith.<br /><br />From the author of I'm Living Your Dream Life and The Things I Wish I'd Said, McKenna Publishing Group.	2005-01-19

This story, The Kite Runner, is so well written, so rich with color, smell, pain, guilt, love, respect . . . it is among the finest I've read in a long, long time. I was sorry to see it end.<br /><br />The Kite Runner is primarily a story about lost childhood. From the narrator's perspective as a boy who had grown up in Afghanistan, and then fled to America with his beloved father, we sense his yearning throughout the tale. His return to his ravaged country of origin years later, where the mysteries of his youth are revealed, bring out the true gift of this talented storyteller. My heart broke for all of the youth of Afghanistan as I read, and I found this account to be very educational in terms of recent Afghan history.<br /><br />I give this book my highest recommendation.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said..	2005-01-12

It starts slowly as we get to know the narrator, Professor Nicholas Van Tassel, and learn to appreciate his highbrow language and pompous attitude toward all things provincial. He's finicky, cerebral, anti-Semitic, anti-exercise, and I didn't visualize him as being particularly good-looking. It's therefore painful to witness his obsession with the beautiful Edna Bliss, who he eventually persuades to marry him, and eventually drives away. Edna isn't particularly likable either. She's secretive, selfish and rigid.<br /><br />Nevertheless, for reasons I'm still sorting out through this review, I was deeply engrossed in both story and character. I can't help but believe that this is because ALL HE EVER WANTED is the product of a master. Anita Shreve's attention to detail, her seemingly flawless creation of time, place and character, makes this book well worth reading. As she narrates the story through Professor Van Tassel, we get to know him well and learn to appreciate his honesty. This is primarily a story of obsession and the bargains of unrequited love. I highly recommend.<br /><br />From the author of: I'm Living Your Dream Life and The Things I Wish I'd Said, McKenna Publishing Group.	2004-11-26

I read it in about half an hour and felt the lesson come through loudly and clearly. The well-written story, sweet and innocent, focuses on two girls who mistreat another girl, Wanda, because she is different.<br /><br />Wanda is a poor girl with a funny last name and she wears the same ill-fitting (yet clean) dress to school each day. One girl, Peggy, is the most popular girl in school, and doesn't seem to realize she's being unthoughtful towards Wanda. The other girl, Maddie, knows she's unthoughtful, primarily by not speaking up to defend Wanda. She realizes she acts out of fear, because she too is not wealthy or well-dressed and she's afraid the tide of insult and ridicule could turn her way at any time. Ultimately, both girls realize their mistaken attitude toward Wanda and try to make amends, hoping against hope that it is not too late.<br /><br />These are very real feelings for nine and ten year old girls and this book tells a helpful/valuable story. Highly recommend.<br /><br />From the author of I'm Living Your Dream Life and The Things I Wish I'd Said, McKenna Publishing Group.	2004-11-02

It's plainly written, often refers to journal entries and is extremely believable. It's not a book that will change your life, but it clearly illustrates a change in the life of Tatum O'Neal.<br /><br />How can you not root for the little girl who gave us Paper Moon? That movie and her Oscar (holding the honor of being the youngest Oscar winner in history) will always be a reference point for a youth and innocence that, as we find out in A Paper Life, was clearly corrupted by punishing, selfish parents. Further, that Tatum O'Neal chose to marry the bad boy of tennis, a man who made a career of being rude and insulting, is really no surprise--especially if you know anything about Freudian psychology. So, the well-publicized responses to this memoir from Tatum's father and ex-husband are not surprising. They're shameful.<br /><br />In this work, Tatum O'Neal wears her heart on her sleeve. There is NOTHING shameful in this. I can only congratulate her for following the road to recovery and allowing her strengths to shine through. This is an important work for many parents to read, to know that no matter how privileged or adored a child may seem to the outside world, all children are human with very real needs. We parents have a tremendous influence on our children and an enormous responsibility. In spite of her own parents setting a terrible example in providing love and acceptance, Tatum O'Neal has broken the cycle by putting her children in the highest place she could--against all the odds.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2004-10-31

In itself, this colorful, beautiful book is a garden of riches.<br /><br />Impeccably put together, it features short stories by Katherine Mansfield, Eudora Welty, John Steinbeck, Nathaniel Hawthorn and Saki. Each story is illustrated with vivid photography that is relevant to each piece. The Chrysanthemums, by Steinbeck, for example, is punctuated with scenes of autumn color.<br /><br />Highly recommended by the author of I'm Living Your Dream Life and The Things I Wish I'd Said, McKenna Publishing Group.	2004-10-27

So what if the main character is on the run for what seem to be foolish reasons! This story is well written and the author's sense of humor comes through loudly and clearly.

It was a twenty-minute flight, and I completed it well before the wheels hit the ground. Even so, I read some of these wonderful and heartfelt poems more than once.<br /><br />My favorite is the title poem, The Difference Now. It's bold and wise and champions maturity. I also liked If Life Were A Book, suggesting we do have the power to write our own life story. Yes, I agree that we do.<br /><br />The most powerful and gripping section of the book consists of poems that focus on the author's late father, who I assume, committed suicide. The pain of the child left behind is apparent, but the sense of recovery is even more apparent. Your Life, My Lesson is especially well done. The weakest area, however, is a series of poems that come across as the revenge of a thwarted woman in an ill-fated love affair. The essence of yearning is, like one reviewer has indicated, reminiscent of a high school diary. I prefer the greater majority of poems that champion wisdom and breakthrough.<br /><br />I think this book of primarily free verse poetry would make a great gift for a grieving friend. It follows a healing path and I enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />From the author of I'm Living Your Dream Life and The Things I Wish I'd Said, McKenna Publishing Group.	2004-10-19

I dove into this book after enjoying \\"The Notebook.\\" With familiar characters and a warm, easy writing style, I wanted to know the narrator and his family better. As I continued, however, it felt more and more like sneaking into someone's diary and I wasn't sure I wanted to know all of the intimate details.<br /><br />It must be said, this author, Nicholas Sparks, is one romantic fellow! He clearly knows what it means to love and be loved and for this, I applaud the story. And just when I was getting a little bored with all the wedding details, he pulls a fast one that made the hair on my arms stand up and my throat feel a little thick. So, while I contemplated giving \\"The Wedding\\" only three stars, I had to add another half star and deem it a good read to satisfy my own romantic nature. Cynics, stay away.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2004-10-03

I picked up this little gem at a church book sale. I think it cost a mere 50 cents. But OH! it is worth so much more. The book is divided into sections where students write letters to renowned authors indicating how his or her book inspired or changed their lives. The entries include a series of heartbreaking stories and conditions by children suffering from extreme illness or as victims of crime to children dealing with divorce and/or the angst of youth. Other letters are sweet and innocent in spirit very simply tell the author what they liked about his/her book and write things like: \\"How the heck are you?\\" and \\"How do you like living in California?\\"<br /><br />The letters are beautifully written--very pure in spirit and in message. One, a letter to author Toni Morrison written by a 15-year-old from Miami, FL was particularly poetic and thought provoking. And another letter by Brandi Hayes, 13, and suffering with Cystic Fibrosis, thanked the parents of Robyn Miller, the authors of \\"Robyn's Book: A True Diary,\\" and asserted her resolve in fighting the disease. It brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />This book provides a brilliant reading list for young readers. I highly recommend it and intend to pass on to my fourth grader.<br /><br />From the author of \\"I'm Living Your Dream Life\\" and \\"The Things I Wish I'd Said,\\" McKenna Publishing Group.	2004-09-29

It's a fast read and for those who have read the six Jane Austen novels discussed by the club, it could be a treat or it could turn your stomach. While I haven't read all the Austen's works, which would no doubt be a big black mark against my reading resume with THIS group, I wasn't at a loss (particularly because the author provides a brief recap of each novel at the back of the book and even more interesting, reprinted commentary and criticism from noted authors from 1812 to 2003). I wasn't at a loss because this is a story of the club members and the club dynamics, not a story about Jane Austen.<br /><br />Although a bit pat, I enjoyed the characters, even the snobby Jocelyn, and believe they had interesting backgrounds. I wanted more, however. More Prudie. More Allegra. More Grigg. More Bernadette (in spite of her long winded stories-but what book club DOESN'T have a Bernadette?) Sylvia and Jocelyn were well covered. Which leads me to this question: Who is the I? The omniscient narrator is the proverbial fly on the wall, I suppose, and it was a little puzzling to me until I chose to accept the style and move on.<br /><br />One note, there's a part during the last book club meeting that brought me to tears. It was a wistful scene when Sylvia watched her husband and grown daughter sitting together in a chair and she longed for her grown, faraway sons and basked in both good and bad memories from their life as a young family. This alone allowed me to give the book another star from the three I originally planned to give.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2004-09-07

While I agree with many reviewers that this book is not his \\"funniest,\\" it does provide some laughs since humor is embedded in his writing style and view of the world. I don't believe that each piece; however, is meant to be funny and as a result, it is rich on many levels and, I feel, a worthwhile collection.<br /><br />Sedaris reveals so many intimate details about his family members, it left me wondering if he had their blessings?!<br /><br />\\"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim,\\" by the way, was no where near as disturbing to me as Augusten Buurroughs' \\"Running With Scissors.\\" But I understand how one cannot help compare the two.<br /><br />If you haven't already, please read \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day.\\" It's one of the funniest books I've ever read.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2004-09-02

It's a plunge into the depths of some very disturbing material--WELL WRITTEN material--but terribly disturbing.<br /><br />To borrow a phrase from the author, which is embedded in the passage entitled TOILET BOWL READINGS, \\"I was mortified but fascinated,\\" while reading this memoir and found myself wishing it were a novel and that these characters were fictional. For example, trying to imagine Dr. Finch, the eccentric shrink who became the legal guardian of the author, having his grown daughter fish out his coiled bowel movements from the toilet in order to read like tea leaves wasn't even the most repulsive scene in this collection.<br /><br />That said, I don't regret the purchase. Augusten Burroughs has not only talent, but also courage, and in spite of (or maybe because of) being the victim of a totally twisted and abusive childhood, an amazing sense of humor.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2004-08-27

And in spite of her shyness and her fierce protection of her private life, in these pages she lets loose and allows us to follow her path of self-discovery. In several aspects she tells the story of many of us who have suddenly found ourselves in the midst of middle age: the conflict of being a working mother (\\"...if I work full time does that make me a part-time mom?\\"); dealing with aging parents and well-guarded family secrets; reaping the joys of a close and loving relationship with a sister and a spouse; and, my favorite, that \\"we're in this together.\\"<br /><br />As she puts forth in the book, she has often been praised for her \\"genuineness\\" and \\"authenticity.\\" This quick read is no exception and I highly recommend taking an afternoon to get to know the real Jane Pauley.

The books of Carl Hiaasen have given me hours upon hours of reading pleasure and his latest effort, SKINNY DIP, is no exception. It's one of those books you find attached to your hand as you go from room to room, sneaking in chapters at every opportunity, since you don't want to put it down. That's plot. But even more, in this story it's about character. (Where does he come up with these creatures?) One can't help but applaud this gifted author's vivid imagination and go along for the ride.<br /><br />The husband, a scientist in name only-or as Hiaasen cleverly proclaims a \\"biostitute\\" since he fakes findings when chemically testing the waters of the Everglades for the price of a new Hummer and the hope of future riches from his redneck employer-is the only truly repulsive character in the tale. He becomes more and more pathetic with each page. Everyone else, however, is remarkably lovable, including the Neanderthal specimen known as \\"Tool,\\" an overgrown oaf with a bullet up his butt who robs the sick and elderly of their pain patches in between stealing highway memorial crosses from freeway embankments just to use to decorate his backyard.<br /><br />A great summer read and I highly, highly recommend.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2004-08-03

I think it has taken me longer to contemplate the review of this book than it took to read. It's without a doubt, a breezy read--good summer fare that is mindless and juicy. And in some cases, especially with the voice of the main character, Amy, very funny.<br /><br />But . . . there's something about it that bothered me. The characters, particularly the satellite characters, are banal (the gay assistant, the well-heeled boss, the fast-talking editor--even the stud-muffin mystery writer), and the plot is contrived and often predictable. I stayed with it because I loved the voice of Amy. She was honest-in spite of being a first class liar-but she lets the readers in on all her secrets and this makes her endearing.<br /><br />While it seems other reviewers liked the switching perspectives between the two friends/enemies, Amy and Tara, so much more time is dedicated to Amy that she is the true voice of the book and Tara remains a caricature. Tara's sections are like a tribute to equal time, rather than equal time. And she is as repulsive as she's meant to be. Can't understand why Amy would want to be friends with her at all, let alone \\"best friends.\\"<br /><br />Overall, I give it three and half stars and recommend the book as fun entertainment.

Congratulations to John McNally for being a gifted storyteller and for putting this collection together in an interesting and creative manner. He has presented a true time capsule complete with scenery, music, language and costume.<br /><br />Ralph is the boy we all knew--an attention hound dressed in a flannel shirt, who spent a lot of time in the school hallways on his way to the dean's office. Hank, however, who tells his stories from the gray, \\"who am I\\" world of suburban Chicago in the 70s, is the boy who faded into the woodwork. He's the boy who was up for anything to make his world a little more exciting and often didn't have a choice when it came to dealing with his eccentric father and, of course, Ralph. Each character, including Hank's sister Kelly and even the lady next door, Mrs. Rybecki, who suffers from Tourette's syndrome, are keenly developed and highly entertaining.<br /><br />When we meet Hank in the future, he's like the guy at your 25th class reunion who everyone wants to know.

It met my number one &quot;requirement&quot; in that is is extremely well written, but the story also has a page-turning quality that makes this quick read hard to put down.<br />The author takes us from the hopping, neon world of Tokyo to the pastoral setting of a Wisconsin lake, to the thriving suburbs of Chicago, to Georgetown (where I could see the streets and tall, brick homes on the Potomac) to the White House and back to Tokyo again, as the likeable main character, Nick Conboy, tries to solve the mystery of Ambassador Strikes' murder.<br />This is a great summer read. A movie played in my head as I eagerly turned the pages and I imagined someone like Ben Afflick, or even Kevin Costner or Harrison Ford playing the lead.<br />I highly recommend this book.	2004-06-10

Hollis Gillespie claims she's \\"ripped the hell off \\" out of her favorite writers, Dave Barry, Carl Hiaasen, David Sedaris (to name a few of my favorites as well) but I found her work to be hilariously original and enjoyed spending a few days of reading alone and often out load to appreciative listeners from *Bleachy-Haired Honky Bitch.* At the conclusion of each piece, I found it was difficult to stop reading. I wanted more.<br />She is honest, unique, laugh-out-loud funny, raunchy and ... sweet. There is a tender side blended into the series, particularly when she writes about her father and other family members. A piece entitled \\"One of Those Nights,\\" about the night she learned her young niece was in a serious accident, was quite poignant.<br />On the other end of the scale, the funny \\"Born Again Booze Weenie,\\" a tale of a talking liver, is alone worth the price of the book.<br />This book created a fan out of me.

I believe the characters illustrated in this lyrical novel will stay with me for some time. It's a beautiful, well-written story. Gayle Brandeis has a true gift. Her main characters are quiet and introspective, and yet we hear their voices very clearly. We see everything they see, feel everything they feel, and smell everything they smell.<br /><br />The plot is built around a series of dead birds--birds inadvertently killed by the main character, a young woman of mixed heritage (Korean and African American) named Ava Sing Lo. Information about each bird--its life and cause of death--are recorded in her mother's scrap book, The Book of Dead Birds. As Ava attempts to break the spell of the dying birds and her shame and sorrow of being a disappointment to her mother we come face to face with her fragility, pain, and insecurity. We, and all those within the story, root for her to soar.<br /><br />Brandeis weaves together two stories--the daughter, Ava, and the mother, Hye-yang (Helen). She takes us from San Diego to the Saltan Sea and back to Korea in the 1960s, where through Ava's retelling of her mother's song, we learn of Hye-yang's slide into prostitution, Ava's conception and their ultimate flight path to freedom.<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend this book. It's one of the best I've read so far this year.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2004-04-20

Beautifully written, the story unfolds when a widower named Glyn discovers an old photo of his wife holding hands with her sister's husband. An accompanying note indicates there had been an affair.

I picked up this book on a whim and don't regret it for one minute.

Recommended to me because I liked the puzzle aspects, historical and artistic references in The DaVinci Code, Katherine Neville's \\"The Eight\\" did not disappoint.

Each time I read a piece by her, it spoke to me-almost sang-made me feel like I not only knew her, but myself a little bit better. I missed her while she was \\"gone\\" but read and enjoyed her fiction as well.<br /><br />This newest collection of columns/essays/speeches, Loud and Clear, is just that: Anna Quindlen loud and clear. With pieces ranging from the early 90s, interspersed with her more recent work, she allows us a glimpse back into the years when her children were still quite young-to the world she faces today as a woman in her fifties and on the threshold of an empty nest. We get to grow and evolve with her as she points out the obvious, makes clear the hazier issues, and always, with refreshing honestly, makes us feel as if we know her as well as we know our next door neighbor.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed, \\"Fall from the Nest,\\" (as it made me think about everything we do to protect our children) \\"17 going on 18,\\" (a warning to young people who take up cigarette smoking), and \\"Anniversary,\\" (which made me miss my mother, dead since 1999.)<br /><br />While many won't agree with her politics, I believe Quindlen puts into words the things we all feel in our hearts, minds, bodies and souls. I highly recommend this book. Thank you for the opportunity to review it.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2004-04-08

With high expectations, I opened the book and finished it so quickly, I couldn't believe I had actually read it from cover to cover.<br />The writing is brilliant. It flows--keeps the reader interested. As for the story? Yeah, well, okay. I appreciated the character development and could see these people moving and talking; but, I can't say they were people I wanted to know or people I wanted to spend more time with beyond the last page. Once the book was over, it left me with little more than a fond smile for the talent that is Steve Martin. It surprised me. As a writer, he comes off as much DEEPER than as an actor or stand-up. I love the fact that he is so multi-talented.<br />I think this little book fills a certain space. When you have a couple spare hours to check it out, it's worth it.

I had hoped to get my hands around just one more collection to add to the mystique that Plath created for me after I read Ariel and The Bell Jar as a teenager. Hughes's poetry, \\"Birthday Letters,\\" which he dedicates to his children rather than his long dead wife, sheds a lot of light on their relationship, and helped to paint a fairer portrait of a man and poet I had previously considered to be unfaithful to someone whose work I admired. How unfair of me! Hughes is/was clearly the MASTER. These poems are riveting.<br /><br />Last week I pulled this book off my shelf and read it again. This time the poems had even greater meaning since I had just seen the film, \\"Sylvia.\\" I felt the movie was as much about Ted Hughes as it was about her and because of it, appreciated these beautiful, telling poems all the more.<br /><br />Birthday Letters is a must for poetry lovers-even if you have no interest in the drama of the relationship between Hughes and Plath. It tells the story of many lovers. Beautifully.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2004-01-21

Homespun and heartfelt, these stories touched me on many levels. Sharon Randall is a gifted writer and a fine storyteller. She has a magical sense of putting it all together, bringing each topic full circle. No matter the subject-something as light as her daughter's tea parties, as funny as her blind brother's adventure in driving, and as sad and poignant as her husband's battle with cancer, she left me with a feeling of warmth-and more often than not, a smile.<br />I read the beautiful piece, \\"The Paper Cranes,\\" to my young daughters and their friends and they listened very intently. It led to a question and answer session about the Atomic Bomb and the end of World War II, and then a fascination with origami and the symbolism of 1,000 paper cranes. It was a lot to take away from one small story.<br />This is a book I'll keep on my shelf and I know I'll refer to it from time to time when I'm looking for a friend with whom I wish to share a thought or feeling. Meanwhile, as a former newspaper columnist (in the San Francisco Bay area) I'll recommend it to everyone as classic material of the genre.

And just before I reached the end, I figured out why. First of all, it's well written and creative-a story like none other I've read or imagined. But it took me a while to get into it. I set it down again and again. As friends kept asking, \\"did you finish?\\" I felt it more of an assignment than a reading pleasure, and sometimes, readers like me just need an assignment. So, I plowed through.<br /><br />I was not disappointed.<br /><br />In the Life of Pi there is a tremendous amount of detail-some seems excessive-but some paints beautiful portraits and draws such complex and fascinating characters, that I feel it (the book) deserves all the recognition it has received. The author must be applauded on his ability to tell the story with an incredible amount of knowledge-of religions, zoology and the life of a castaway. It's fun to discuss and to hear the opinions of other readers, especially to find out whether or not they delved the meaning(s) (or any meanings) of the young boy's tall tale.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book, and will look into other works by this talented writer.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2004-01-20

It is a tale of grief and how one man copes in the aftermath of his wife's rather mysterious death. From the premise-an educated linguist attempts to teach his dog, the only witness to his wife's demise, to speak in order to explain to him how it happened-one might assume it's a comedy. It is anything but. It is a tragic love story, the outcome of which we know from page one, but the author cleverly allows the story of this doomed relationship to unfold so that we fall in love with the main characters: Paul the husband/linguist, Lexi the wife/mask artist and Loralei, the Rhodesian Ridgeback and true hero.<br />While his friends and colleagues think Paul is crazy, and to some degree he is, the reader has the benefit of knowing that he is, in actual fact, temporarily consumed with his grief. I think reading this story helped me to understand how each person who grieves over the death of a loved one does so in his or her own way. We want to protect and we can't help but judge, but well, we're all flawed. Who is to say how we would react to the death of our dearly beloved and to what means we'd go to have unanswerable questions answered?<br />I highly recommend this book. In addition to outstanding storytelling, the writing is tight and very readable. Five Stars.<br />From the author of \\"I'm Living Your Dream Life,\\" McKenna Publishing Group	2004-01-13

This is the story of Orno, a self-proclaimed hayseed from Missouri, who moves to New York City to attend Columbia University. There he meets Marshall, a man who changes the course of his life.<br />Marshall is a genius with the gift of eidetic memory. He's a rogue student, voyeur, classic alcoholic/drug addict, and maybe even manic-depressive. Orno is magnetized to him like an alter ego, and consequently, Marshall is also drawn to Orno, recognizing in him the qualities he lacks in spite of his seemingly privileged background. They attend many of the same classes, date the same women and eventually, after he makes the decision to attend dental school (much to Marshall's disapproval), Orno falls in love with Marshall's more stable and wise sister. Belittling his own stable yet na√Øve background, Orno tries to make his way in an unfamiliar world, mistaking the dysfunction of the Emerson family for sophistication. Triumphant, Orno manages to hold onto his integrity, learns to appreciate his own father and is an earnest and likeable character.<br />For Kings and Planets is a love story (exploring love between friends, siblings, parents and children and lovers), and ultimately a coming of age tale.

Take it seriously or don't, but just enjoy the original and thought provoking story. Readable in a few hours, the author doesn't ask you to invest a lot in his tale of Eddie, the ride maintenance man at an amusement park called Ruby Pier, and the five people and ensuing five lessons he learns upon his accidental and heroic death.<br /><br />With \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven,\\" Mitch Albom attempts to tackle the oft-mused subject of what happens to us after we die. I, for one, appreciate it when creative people-writers-spin their yarns and offer their own, unique versions of heaven. Who, after all, hasn't thought about \\"life\\" after death? There are probably as many versions as there are people who attempt to create them. And Albom's presentation is an exercise in simple language and has a very pleasant voice.<br /><br />Not at all morbid, or even overly emotional, this tale made me feel good about my life and my loved ones.

This is the delightful story of 17-year-old Cassandra Mortmaine, who records in a series of journals what could be an ordinary life of a young girl teaching herself how to write. But instead the narrator develops an extraordinary coming-of-age-fairy tale set in a deteriorating castle outside London. We explore sibling relationships, parent-child relationships and the powerful feelings associated with first love.<br />Filled with a cast of well drawn characters who are both down-to-earth and sublimely eccentric, I was captivated from page one by Cassandra's charming innocence. It can easily be compared to Jane Austen's work and now fifty-five years in print, it's appropriate to label it a classic.

The first, who begins the story and sucks in the reader with good, descriptive writing, tells the complicated tale of the older sister, Nicole, facing the rape and ensuing pregnancy of her severely handicapped and institutionalized sister, Jenny.<br />Returning home after ten years and choosing to stay and care for Jenny during the last four months of her pregancy, has Nicole facing her dysfunctional past and an uncertain and frightening future. And during this stage of the story I feel the writing loses its grasp. The dialog is pat and once full characters become flat and predictible.<br />Nevertheless, I was interested in the characters and hoped for a writing rebound. So, I stayed with it for the story rather than the writing. Happy to reach a satisfying conclusion, I deemed the reading experience worth my time.<br />I think this book may find its strongest audience with those who have lived with a retarded sibling (in this case a MUST read) or have in some way been attached to someone suffering from extreme disabilities where unspoken communication comes into play.<br />I intend to read Amy Yurk's first novel, The Kind of Love That Saves You, because I believe she has talent and am interested in her work.<br />Thank you for the opportunity to review The Language of Sisters.	2003-09-27

Through the fresh voice of a wise young girl, Evelyn Bucknow, her life in the state of Kansas and all the supporting characters surrounding her come alive. She is indeed the center of everything and we immediately respect her--especially her ability to rise above very unfortunate circumstances. No matter how eccentric, bizarre or pathetic the people in her life are, we see them through her loving eyes. Even characters that might be considered villains, her proud and bitter mother, the snobby classmate and her equally snobby sidekick for example, are all presented with redeeming qualities.<br /><br />With several historical references, even if they're only as far back as the 1980s, the story is believable and well told. We've all shared many of Evelyn's thoughts while coming of age. A quick read with exceptional attention to detail, I think it's well worth your time.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2003-09-19

As the main character, Lily Owens, searches for love, I couldn't help but fall in love with her. She's wholesome, innocent and at the same time, a great liar.

She is also not afraid to show her serious side and reveal her vulnerabilities. Mostly Laskas had me laughing, but sadly, there are elements that aren't so funny. Believing at first this would be a \\"fish out of water story\\"-city couple tries to make dream of farm living a reality and everything goes wrong-it is quite the contrary.

I'd like to be nice about this-the author is young-but I can't be nice and honest at the same time. This is one of the worst books I've ever read. Motivated to purchase it by the hype and looking for something juicy, \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" was not much more than a great title. The author simply cannot hide behind her experience as onetime assistant to Vogue's Anna Wintour no matter how much she expects us to believe this was a product of an overactive imagination making things up at four in the morning.<br />First of all, it's poorly written-filled with flat peripheral characters-and includes passive voice, clich&eacute;s and sentences ending in prepositions (HORRORS!) for which she actually apologizes since she, and by she I of course mean her main character, fancies herself a talented and educated writer headed for a position with \\"The New Yorker.\\" Without a doubt it is a thinly veiled product of the author's personal experience, which may have been easier to swallow if she didn't write in the first person. This main character, Andrea Sachs, a junior personal assistant to the most influential woman in fashion, is as loathsome and arrogant as her boss, the she-devil named Miranda Priestly. I would have loved to hate the demanding and rude Miranda, but in this story she is a boring, two-dimensional villain. The only reason I stayed with it for over 330 pages was so that I could see just how this lowly assistant would finally leave her hellish enslavement. And even that was terribly unsatisfactory. What could have been a truly triumphant moment, turned into a squeak (\\"that's all!\\") and an opportunity to profit on the resale of thousands of dollars worth of designer clothes she'd \\"borrowed\\" from the magazine's \\"closet.\\"<br />Ms. Wiesenberger may have just signed the book deal a \\"million girls would die for,\\" but this sort of kiss-and-tell book-a mere opportunity to name drop and dish the rich and famous-reeks of bitterness and naivet&eacute;. (Writing this review makes me feel the same way!) The only thing I can say I truly enjoyed was her dedication and acknowledgments. Now that writing was witty. As for the rest of it, save your money. If you like this kind of thing and want something dishy, read The Nanny Diaries instead.the same way!) The only thing I can say I truly enjoyed was her dedication and acknowledgments.

The road/story begins in Boston and ends up in an ongoing poker game in New York City where Ruby learns how NOT to bluff her way out of her relationships. The relationships she includes are with some wacky girlfriends, a shrink (er, I mean therapist) and a boyfriend or two. Since we're opposite a shrink as often as we're seated at a card table, we also learn about Mom, Dad and brother, too. Many of us who like this genre-these stories of single gals in the city (many of whom, like Ruby, happen to be writers)-find these tales blend together and become the same story over and over. This is NOT the case with Girls' Poker Night. Davis's voice is unique, unquestionably funny and well worth the four hours it takes to read. Thanks for putting it out there and I look forward to future work by this gifted writer.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2003-04-02

I am glad to see character-driven works like this make it into book form. Reading it over the course of one or two days (short-punchy) feels like making a new, entertaining friend. Written in first person by Liza, the younger sister, she simply babbles on and on about her boyfriend, her coworkers, her career crises, her parents and, of course, the other half of her \\"perfect Elizabeth,\\" her sister Bette. It's similar to Bridget Jones, but Liza is not quite as self-loathing-or as funny. While it failed to make me laugh out loud, it is light and humorous and I recommend it.	2003-03-24

The story has potential but it didn't keep me interested. I finally had to stop after 160 pages. I don't think it's fair to call it unoriginal--if I had read it before, say Bridget Jones and others like it--than it would have been the first of its kind at least through my eyes. I think the author tries to be funny and a lot of it falls flat, and I simply can't believe this main character is actually a smart person. The plot indicates otherwise. Again, I wanted to like this book. It's a worthy effort, but I think the talented author can do better.	2003-03-16

It is well written, colorful and unique. From the moment we meet Mma Ramotswe and follow her story from girlhood, through an abusive marriage and into her ambitious foray as the proprietor of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, she earns our respect and admiration-just as she shows respect and admiration for everything around her. Alexander McCall Smith captures the character and culture of Gaborone, a village in Botswana, and tells a sweet and entertaining story. I've noticed other reviewers label it a mystery; however, in my opinion it is a series of mysteries--one about a missing boy kidnapped by witch doctors winds through the book, and others unfold in each chapter where new cases are presented to the fledgling agency. A wonderful and charming book, which I highly recommend.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2003-03-16

They chose the island for its beauty and its pace and because they had fond memories of past vacations there. The Blanchards soon learned, of course, that operating a restaurant in a place where everything-building materials, equipment, food-must be imported (with a 25 percent duty on top of it), was no vacation. Everything but the staff had to be imported from either neighboring St. Martin or Puerto Rico or Miami.<br />Written in first person in the voice of Melinda Blanchard, she describes charming island characters and does a good job with \\"island patois.\\" She gives a worthwhile account of the efforts to build (and then rebuild after a category 4 hurricane destroys their establishment) and run this exclusive restaurant-the choice of Hollywoods stars and VIPs. She even peppers the pages with recipes. The pace slows down to island time in the middle with perhaps too much detail about boat building and racing and local carnival celebrations, but overall it was a good read and very inspirational. Congratulations Mr. and Mrs. Blanchard.	2003-03-11

Written with warmth and humor, it is the most original and enjoyable material I've read in months. Jeanne Marie Laskas doesn't have to try too hard to be funny. She just is. There are certain repetitions regarding her inner princess, her husband's all pants half-off joke, stupid sheep, etc. and the roo, roo, roo and woof, woof, woof that give voices to her beloved dogs, Betty and Marley, that make the story come alive. She is also not afraid to show her serious side and reveal her vulnerabilities. Mostly Laskas had me laughing, but sadly, there are elements that aren't so funny. Believing at first this would be a \\"fish out of water story\\"-city couple tries to make dream of farm living a reality and everything goes wrong-it is quite the contrary. This is a love story-love between a couple, their extended family (family members, city friends, country friends, their fifty acres of farmland, and lots and lots of animals. Bravo!!!

First of all, it's fairly long-or seemed long-so I didn't whip through it like I do most of the books I read. So Cannie, the main character, has been in my life for a while.<br /><br />It must be said that Jennifer Weiner is a very gifted writer. Through her characters we learn that she's funny and smart, and her witty banter keeps you reading. Her Cannie is well drawn and likable and it's what gets the reader through most of the rather contrived plot.<br /><br />I loved the first half, where we meet a \\"large woman\\" and experience her coming-of-age metamorphosis; however, I found her friendship with the Hollywood starlet, as well as other plot diversions, to be (again) contrived and even juvenile. Nevertheless . . . the author is clearly a talent worth watching and because of this, I highly recommend Good In Bed as a fun-and  mindless read.<br /><br />The paperback version, which I picked up at a Target store (when I was supposed to be buying socks for my kids), labeled it a \\"beach book.\\" Now I know why.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens is the author of [[ASIN:1932172300 It's Not Your Mother's Bridge Club]]	2003-01-18

Extremely well written, it takes you from the Oval Office and the witty mind of Winston Churchill to the ship's galleys where we meet enlisted men, officers (and the women they love) and my particular favorite character, the USS Arizona herself. Reading this book allows you to experience a fictional account of the early Twentieth Century world and the events and attitudes leading to the Japanese invasion at Pearl Harbor.

I enjoyed this epic so much; I read it twice and very well may read it again. I must admit that the first time I picked up Poisonwood Bible I was interrupted a few times and couldn't keep straight all the voices. (Kingsolver tells the tale of a missionary family's experience in the in the mid-20th century Congo in five voices: a mother, and her four daughters.) But once these colorfully drawn characters embedded themselves into my mind, it was to hell with the interruptions! Each character is unique and propels the story forward--the history of the village and the country's fight for independence unfolds. I couldn't put it down. Kingsolver is a master at her craft and this effort ranks in my favorite top-ten books of all time. I can't think of a higher recommendation than that.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2003-01-11

It is incredibly well written (it reads like a novel) and the author is so honest and forthright, she becomes a teacher on issues beyond transgender and ultimately into clinical depression. It's a terribly sad story, painful and emotional on many levels, yet ultimately triumphant and always very FUNNY!

The writing is good, funny. It made me laugh out loud and kept me reading. After completing \\"Attention Deficit Disorder-Who Knew?\\" a poignant and honest account of a child's classroom struggles, I felt this was going to be on a par with \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" by David Sedaris. But sadly, in the end I was disappointed. I believe the author is talented and accomplishes her mission of presenting stream-of-consciousness material, but the collection lacked a palpable order and ultimately provided more questions than answers. Take, for example, the piece titled \\"Celebration,\\" about her twin sons' second birthday party coinciding with a call from the pediatrician and the devastating news that cancer has spread to her son's lungs. She predicts he won't make it to his third birthday; however, we don't really learn the outcome. To mix this serious topic with the whimsical subjects of 3-M notepads and doggies in Burberry trenchcoats made me long for a little organization. Take me down a funny road, take me down a serious road-but give me some warning signals, please. Perhaps this is why the subtitle is \\"a fractured memoir.\\" I think I might prefer the novels she mentions in the essays. Will they be published anytime soon?<br />I've read that good writers borrow from great writers and great writers steal the material overtly. In the essay named \\"Quack,\\" I wonder if the author borrowed or stole from Arlo Guthrie. Janis Jaquith has shown moments of greatness in Birdseed Cookies, but overall, I think this was a just a good book.	2002-12-16

Through his CARE escorts, Bryson sees and describes a country that most tourists either never see and (even after visits to East Africa) do not know exists. I have seen the slum Kibera from a passing train and the smell and noise perforated the train walls as we rumbled by. That Byrson walked the streets of this enormous conglomeration of tin roofs and dung and garbage-filled alleys is amazing. Peppering in his fears and a little humor, he captures the despair and ultimately, the hopelessness. While Kenyan residents like to say there's always hope, anyone who has worked for CARE or is familiar with its tasks, realizes that there isn't much hope in changing the lives of those in Third World slums and refugee camps. I'm happy to know my purchase of this book made a contribution to CARE, because all we can really do is keep funding the attempt to improve these lives just a little bit. Mr. Bryson, I'm glad you made it through all those light aircraft adventures and look forward to reading more of your future work.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2002-12-16

It had a juicy, gossipy tone and the sweet conveyance of a person wronged attaining her comeuppance. But that's the problem I had with it, too. While the authors clearly indicate the story is fiction, and we can believe them as they have no doubt pulled their stories together to create the characters, I can't help but think that a certain Mrs. X is somewhere in the streets of Manhattan wearing out the soles of her Prada shoes while defending and denying. Or at the very least, telling her side of the story.<br /><br />While it's fun to hate the rich, they do have a story. And we don't really get a 3-D picture of Mrs. X. So, while I hate her for the neglect of her child and her seemingly unfair treatment of the hired help, as a business owner (who considers herself both fair and generous) I feel the smallest need to defend her. I am too often faced with bitter employees who never feel as though they are paid or appreciated enough. They end up hating me because they are not me. (And I'm not rich, I take care of my own kids and I don't wear designer shoes!)<br /><br />So, good for you former Nannies-white, American girls who speak French and have expensive college educations and supportive families. Good for you for writing such a fun and popular book. I hope your success is delicious rather than bittersweet.

I highly recommend this collection.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of I'm Living Your Dream Life and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2002-06-18

I was sorry to see this story end because the main character, irreverence and all, was incredibly enjoyable. He tries to fool you with a fa√ßade of self-deprecation, but clearly he knows (and so do we) that he's the smartest one in the room. It's been a long time since I've read something that made me laugh out loud so often. This work reminds of the books I've read by Carl Hiaasen. And it should be as successful. Readers: TAKE HEED!<br />Ron Ehrens has a gift with language. His characters are clearly drawn and character development is the strongest part of his writing. You see each of them and hear them speak. And by book's end, you know them as friends.<br />As for the plot, well, it's a sort of coming-of-age book filled with self-discovery. He's searching . . . and it's fun to go on the trip to Jamaica. I don't get the super model back in Chicago (and the main character's little moment with her) and find some things to be a little contrived-but truly, I had a feeling of \\"So What!\\"  For me this book wasn't about plot, it was about character. And I think Ehrens did a brilliant job. Can't wait to read the next one.	2002-06-12

All this hype about liberals and conservatives . . . simply put, it's a story about extremes. There's blood and guts, sex and corruption all keeping the pages turning. The liberals look bad, (they're fouling up the country) the conservatives look bad (they're murdering maniacs)and even a Catholic priest ends up as a bad guy. I'm not exactly sure why I liked it, but it sucked me in and I recommend it as a story when you're in the mood to let loose.	2002-05-15

I think it took a great deal of courage to write, as it's got a real &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot; feel to it. &quot;An unconventional mother in a very conventional time,&quot; is a euphemism to say the least.<br />Her mother is a tough character to love and I spent most of the book feeling sorry for the author and her siblings. From the moment I read the mother left her 4 and 7-year-old children in a hotel room in Maui over night, I was outraged. Sensing the author's resentment toward her mother from the onset, I kept looking for rage! She paints a watercolor portrait of a Picasso-like subject and I tore through the book looking for FEELING. By telling the story through the eyes of a child, it's obedience, respect and naivete that come through. At last, I found rage in the last part of the book--but even it was expressed through a curtain of deep respect.<br />In spite of an alcoholic philandering mother, who withholds seemingly unforgiveable truths, the author manages to forgive her and is triumphant in the end. Meanwhile, it's a nice trip to the islands with vivid descriptions and an insider's view we tourists don't get to see.	2002-05-13

This well-written and entertaining book was partially responsible for my move to Tucson. My husband and I discussed moving to a warmer climate for the winter and Tucson \\"won\\" after I read Kingsolver's book. I also enjoyed hearing her soft, comfortable voice on tape as she read these essays to us on one long, cross-country journey. Thank you for this, and all your books Ms. Kingsolver. I've been a fan for years.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2002-03-27

I truly enjoyed this book and intend to recommend it to every mom (and dad, too) that I know. Reading these slice-of-life snippets is a lot like having a chat with a good friend on a morning walk. She covers subjects familiar to all of us--from ATM machines to pest control to getting (and paying for) crowns at the dentist's office. She, by the way, mentioned her crown was $680. I just paid $840 for mine!<br />Ms. Dean-Epps, it was fun getting to know the \\"amalgam that is you!\\" My only complaint is that I wasn't ready for the book to end. Will there be more?	2002-02-11
