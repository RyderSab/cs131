I wouldn't even mind a book written in the style of The Golden Turkey Awards. <br />Overall, the list of sites is interesting, but the comments seem to insult the fans of certain sites more than the web sites themselves. ...based on the sites I scanned through. I got irritated with the writer's shallow view of things. (Yeah, I know he's 17, but I expect more from a mass produced book.) I had trouble reading all of the book.  Anything he didn't seem to understand or agree with was immediately discounted as &quot;Stupid.&quot; There is also very little information about the web sites mentioned which shouldn't be a surprise when there are two sites mentioned on each page. <br />I have no problem with a book that lists and pokes fun at the unusual web sites. I just can't recommend this one. This material is more suited for a personal web site.	2004-07-13

It's crammed with information on locations and rituals. It also teaches about shrines and temples. Related history is provided as well. There are illustrations and diagrams for almost everything. There is no wasted space on the pages.<br />I've never seen a book this size have this much information packed into it. It's safe to assume there may be other books that might go into more detail on some of the subject matter, but this book should cover what most people need to know to enjoy a visit to the region.	2003-06-21

It covers basic conversation divided into appropriate categories - introductions, greetings, apologizing, asking for something, questions, taking a bus, sightseeing and others.<br />There is a section that covers Japanese expressions - show his eyes something (discipline someone), to have one's eyes stolen (to be captivated by beauty), he broke his mouth (he confessed), you can't touch it (impossible to deal with). It's a long list. Another section discusses words that can have vague or multiple meanings. Language and Culture are also here.<br />You may think it's dumb to have a section called Language in a book that teaches a language, but here it covers tongue-twisters, word play, word games, dialects, and polite language.<br />The book might be somewhat basic, but it's a great starting place.	2003-06-21

I rarely learn anything new. This book covers many of the same topics in other books, but the writers go into more detail on some items. That's were I learned things here. I already knew the basic ideas, but they went deeper into the topics. <br />I liked how detailed the writers got in describing how the male and female parts are alike. Comparisons are made with each part. How a part of a woman is like something on a man. I enjoyed their discussion on how each part was neurally connected to other parts. <br />I also liked the part of the book describing a genital massage which I had never read about. (p119-120) <br />I would recommended this book over any other I've seen. I do wish they had some illustrations for some of the techniques given here. The book is strictly text with some parts highlighted (grey background) and icons to draw attention to main points or topic titles. I recall one verbal description of a technique that seemed confusing when I read it. Some type of picture would have helped. Unfortunately, I don't remember which technique it was.	2002-09-26

Lovecraft (at least in this volume) seem to take place within the same strange world. It's almost like some reference each other without having the same characters reappear. Many of the creatures in his stories are either aliens from another world or demons. <br />I originally purchased this volume because of \\"The Colour Out of Space\\" which was used for the movie Die, Monster, Die starring Boris Karloff and Nick Adams. You also have \\"Herbert West - Reanimator\\" which was used for Re-Animator. Although I haven't seen it, judging from the DVD case, the movie Dagon is actually based on \\"The Shadow Over Innsmouth\\" and not \\"Dagon.\\" (\\"Innsmouth\\" has the Order of Dagon in it.) <br />Although there is a quote from Stephen King on the back, I didn't find these stories overly scary. They were enjoyable and interesting. \\"The Picture in the House\\" and \\"The Hound\\" are good horror stories. <br />His writing style took a little getting used to. Using words like \\"shew\\" struck me as a bit odd at first. <br />These are the only stories of his I've read, but I do feel he is a great writer.	2002-09-20

Some of the basic concepts are there, but it is quite different.<br />A small group of astronauts travel to a far away planet and run into something they didn't expect to find. Humans with animal instincts. Apes wearing modern clothes (for the time period the book was written - early 1960s) and driving cars. The humans destroy the astronauts' ship, leaving them stranded on this unusual world.<br />I can't really discuss much more without the risk of making a spoiler.<br />The book goes very quickly and doesn't really dwell on details. For me, the final ending involving those reading the story was predictable. It's still an enjoyable book. As with much sci-fi, social themes are hidden within the fictional situations. The point of this one was fairly clear, but I also knew about the themes before reading the book. The book was discussed some in Behind the Planet of the Apes.	2002-06-22

The image in the lower right corner on mine has a light blue pattern with a few circles and bubbles. (That's what it looks like to me.) Mine is definitely the second edition. <br />I do agree with many of the other reviews here. In some ways, this book is very basic, and they reference other Sybex books throughout. Each chapter states what book the information came from. This is almost like a Best Of collection. <br />For me, the book was very helpful. I'm very expirienced with Windows. Over the years I've also used Apple DOS, ProDOS, MS-DOS, DR DOS, OS/2, and Mac OS. This book had enough information for me to understand Linux better. The writers mainly compare Linux and Windows. Most of the focus is on Red Hat and GNOME. I'm actually using SuSE with the KDE desktop. There's a chapter on installing Red Hat. <br />I do like the information presented on using the command line. It's basic but enough to be useful. Later chapters discuss more advanced topics like server configurations, using Samba, and setting up Apache. It also covers how things work. ...under the hood. Since I'm not a Linux veteran, I can't really comment on the advanced topics, but I did find the book easy to follow.	2002-06-07

It contains well-written biographies of Lon Chaney Sr., Bela Legosi, Peter Lorre, Lon Chaney Jr., Boris Karloff, and Vincent Price. If you do manage to find a copy of this book, keep in mind it was published before Price's death so it doesn't mention his last few movies or his death. I think I bought this book over 15 years ago. ...possibly 18 years ago. <br />There are several photos throughout the book - publicity stills, behind the scenes pics, and a few casual shots. There is an interesting photo of Legosi playing Jesus, and he really looked the part. Beck does provide much about the lives of the actors and some of their views on acting. There is a complete filmography for each actor. <br />The binding does not seem to hold up well under repeated use. I'm not sure how a copy that is simply old might be. I read and studied the photos several times.	2001-11-29

There is much information on each of their movies including behind the scenes events. Several photos throughout. For each movie, you get the cast, a summary, photos, and background information. <br />I didn't feel there was too much information. When reading about older movies, I like having as much information as possible. I enjoy the history, and this book does a good job of providing that.	2001-11-22

The story focuses on the downward spiral that ... use can cause. Pendragon and his wife travel through Europe and find themselves wanting to satisfy their addictions. King Lamus offers to help them whenever they are ready for it. I have mixed feelings about his ideas on rehab. I disagree with the back cover's claim that magick is involved, but that's just my personal view. <br />There is some interesting poetry scattered throughout the story. Most is pretty good and very strange at times. <br />I don't think I can say much more that the other reviewers haven't already said. <br />I originally got this book because a girl I admired suggested it when we met for lunch. She made some very good book suggestions that day. I enjoyed this book regardless of what influenced my purchase. It may be incredibly weird to some people, but I like weird. It was a nice change from the typical novel.	2001-09-24
US	51141218	R2ZOTWRV79AG7P	0671797972	557658136	Dead Sea Scrolls Deception	Books	4	26	29	N	N	Could be upsetting to some people	I originally got interested in the Dead Sea Scrolls because of references in the anime series Neon Genesis: Evangelion. I wanted to see if they truly used information from them or just took some creative liberty. At the moment, I still don't have that answer. I also had no clue what I was going to find in the process.<br />This book is well written and references several different works. I'm not going to base my view on one source. I feel The Church has lied to people in the past - in some cases feeling it was best not to upset people's beliefs. The idea of material being hidden is not too far fetched. The authors attitude is understandable at the time they were writing it since they felt scholars were being cut off from a great find. The book doesn't seem to be well balanced, but I do understand their point of view. <br />In response to one reviewer, using the references in the index, Masada is consistantly mentioned as falling in 74 AD. <br />The Postscript mentions that most of the Scrolls have been published after the American edition of this book went to press. Personally I have only seen two books translating any parts of the scrolls - Eisenman and Wise's book and Allegro's book. <br />Anyone with strong religious beliefs may not accept everything these authors have to say. There are suggestions that chip away at the foundations of Christianity, and they do make sense. I don't know if I totally agree with them, but I see where the ideas are coming from. <br />As with any religious debate, you have to decide what works for you. I do like this book, but I would recommend reading other material before finalizing any personal choices.	2001-09-23

If Rally can stop Bean from making a drug delivery, Bean will quit running drugs. If Rally loses, she promises to quit bugging him. <br />Rally has a few major setbacks. As a result of the events in previous volumes, Rally has lost all of her licenses except for her drivers license. She can't be a bounty hunter, possess a gun, or run her gun shop for at least a month. <br />Anytime Bean is involved, there will always be racing, and the race is a fantastic part of the story. Plus you have the usual action you can expect from this series. Misty, Minnie May, and Ken are here too. There are some humorous moments. The best involves Rally hiding in the closet while searching Bean's home. There's also the insensitivity of some people in how they talk to Rally about her situation at the beginning - Kate being stupid and Faye asking for a favor. <br />This is for mature audiences. There is some minor nudity (a little of Bean too) and suggestive moments. There are some close-ups of wounds being treated - as in stitches. The art is black and white so it may not be too bad for some people, and we're only talking about a couple of panels.	2001-09-18

This is volume 5 or the series and concludes the story that started in the previous volume. However, it's not Goldie's final appearance. <br />The back cover of the previous volume suggested that Goldie is an assassin, but here she is described as a boss. Both titles could be true, but she doesn't appear to take orders from anyone. Goldie is an expert killer. <br />Kerasine came up at the end of Goldie vs. Misty. Now we see just how bad kerasine really is. Goldie manages to get a strong hold on Rally and causes her to get into serious trouble. Rally is strong, but she may need some help. Once again we see a little more of Minnie May's past. It will be a little longer before we begin Rally's past. ...but not in this volume. <br />The fight in the graveyard is great. ...and weird! The ending had a nice twist too. <br />This is for mature audiences. The storyline is a bit intense, and there is some nudity.	2001-09-12

Misty	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A New Villian for GSC	This is volume 4 of the series. <br />Misty has just gotten out of jail and is already in trouble. (We briefly saw Misty in volume 2: Misfire.) It turns out The Mob is VERY interested in some videotapes Misty has acquired from a friend who was in jail with her. We also learn more about Ken and Minnie May's past. Near the end of this volume, a new drug is being sold on the street. This is the first time kerasine shows up in the manga. This volume does end with a cliffhanger and is concluded in volume 5: Bad Trip. <br />Goldie is a highly skilled assassin who works for the don. She is ruthless and merciless. ...extremely merciless. She feels that the weak should die and anyone who makes a mistake deserves the consequences - even death. &quot;Incompetents are better off dead... Don't you think?&quot; (No page numbers - This quote is near the beginning of the second chapter,&quot;Decoy.&quot;) <br />Goldie probably ends up being the one villian to show up more often than any of the others, and she is the best villian in the series. Much better than Radinov in the OVA (Bulletproof) but similiar to her too. <br />The action becomes more believeable starting in this volume. You still see great stunts, but it's easier to believe someone actually doing these things. <br />The story seems a little more developed this time. There's more time allowed for things and characters to be explained. <br />This is for mature audiences.	2001-09-11

This is volume 3 of the Gunsmith Cats series. <br />The continues the Gray storyline from volume 2: Misfire. Although Gray is behind bars, he is making plans that involve Rally and Minnie May. Rally is forced into the hospital after breaking her ribs in the last volume. Bean has an extended appearance here - about a third of the book at least. Ken Taki makes another brief appearance. <br />The action sometimes borderlines on believeability, but hey, it's fun. Most of it is possible, just not likely and involve a ton of skill and luck. There seems to be more humor in this volume than in the previous ones. My personal favorite involves Becky walking in while May is a little preoccupied. Becky seems to be a focus of most of the humor this time - just a few moments here and there. Either she does something or something happens to her that's funny. The focus of this manga is action though, and there are plenty of shootouts. You also have a nice, long chase involving Bean. <br />As I've stated in other reviews, this manga is not for kids. Recommended for mature audiences. Treat this as a good R-rated action story.	2001-09-10

The work looks familiar to some of the more experienced police officers, but things may not be as they appear to be. Plus, Rally makes someone a little mad, and now he wants to kill her. During all of this, some friction developes between Rally and Minnie May. Their gun shop gets broken into too. Yep! I'm being vague, but this is a review, not a spoiler. <br />Ken Taki shows up, and we learn where Minnie May learned some of her skills. This is the first appearance of Ken, and he's only in a small part of this volume even if a large chunk of the plot involves him. We also learn just how young Rally and May really are. <br />This is not for kids as the very first sentence in the book should tell you. There is mature content. You have all of the elements of a good quality, R-rated action movie. The sexual material is more suggestive here than in the first volume. You saw the outline of things there. Here it's mainly suggestive comments and a few things taking place just outside of the frame. <br />I would recommend this to any fan of action movies. This is the second volume of the series. It might work on its own, but there is more to the story which is continued in the next volume - Return of Gray.	2001-09-08

It was actually the second part of title that grabbed my attention. I guess you could say I was a father figure to a teen girl at the time. I got this book in an attempt to understand the world she is growing up in. As a guy, I might tend to be blind to what girls have to put up with. I needed a little education. We should be more aware of what's going on. Young girls being bombarded with images of rail-thin models - some too thin even for my taste. It's unrealistic for all girls to be like those presented in the media, but most of them want that on some level. They feel they need to be like those in magazine and TV ads. All of that is discussed here. I feel this is a great book. I didn't feel as if this book was simply out to bash the media which could have been an easy path to take. It is a well-presented argument for social changes that need to be made. We see examples of some of the girls being affected by our girl-poisoning society.	2001-08-27

No other edition was available until around 1986. <br />This book has been made into 8 movies, 2 animated versions (made for video I think), and at least 3 musicals. The actors to play The Phantom over the years (in the movies) have included Lon Chaney, Claude Rains, Herbert Lom, Maximillan Schell, Robert Englund, Charles Dance, and Julian Sands. The three musicals I know of were written by Ken Hill, Andrew Lloyd-Webber, and Maury Yeston. The basic idea has been borrowed many times in movies, TV, and even some Japanese manga (comics). The Phantom of the Paradise is probably the better known of these. <br />Gaston Leroux's book is a mystery romance that uses some classic Beauty and The Beast elements. You have a deformed man who wants a normal life with a wife. He does have some negative traits which you'll discover as you read. At some point, most of his secrets get revealed. <br />Contrary to some of the movie versions, the story has nothing to do with stolen music, and acid does not cause him harm. Before Christine's father died, he used to tell her about the legend of The Angel of Music who visits promising musicians and singers. Now, The Angel has visited her and is helping her advance her career. The adventure begins. <br />There is much more I'd love to say here, but everytime I type it I feel as if I'm doing some mini-spoilers. If you've read any of my reviews of the movies, you can tell I have much to say about any version of this story. <br />The writing style is not the best, but this is a fantastic story. Also keep in mind this is a translation from French, and that could be a factor in the writing style here as we see it in English. The new translation is a little better. (This and most of the editions out there are the older translation.)	2001-08-26

Many people may get the wrong idea from this title. This is not written like those government conspiracy books. He's not setting out to attack Christians. Moore wants you to know what happened as Christianity developed. In the material before the first chapter, he states that this is not a history book on Christianity. However, it does come across as a history book. Some readers may have trouble with the way the book is organized. It does make sense, but you do need to go back and forth between pages if you want to follow everything. The main text makes many references to material in the appendix. It's not really written to be read from the first to last page like most books. I still recommend this book. There are things presented in this book that need to be known. Read it and decide for yourself. He's not going tell you what to believe. Moore presents the situation. Take that information and choose what works for you. Some people may not be ready for what is said here. You have to choose what works for you.	2001-08-25

I don't know if I can actually point to true results created by what this book teaches, but I did feel better about everything. I did get sidetracked during the past few months and have just now started practicing this again. <br />Everything is written in an easy to follow format. I found it to be a very lively presentation. I wasn't bored and didn't feel like things were dragging along as I read it. It was able to hold my attention. <br />I usually avoid books that mention God unless it's a history or social book. I don't like being told what to believe. I feel like such books are forcing a certain view onto me. <br />Catherine Ponder is a minister so there are references to God in the explination of how things work. I don't mind this approach. It doesn't offend me. Similiar techniques have been presented in religion-neutral books, and this brings the information to an audience who might not read the other books on this topic. <br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone. I love it.	2001-08-23

The book's main focus is on Crowley's Thoth deck. Until I read the other reviews here, I never really considered the idea of it working for other decks. I have trouble seeing it as being helpful for any deck other than the Thoth deck. In the descriptions for each card, the book discussed the symbols used in the Thoth deck. Angeles does cover much more than that though. <br />In the discussion of the Major Arcana, you will find 3 to 4 pages discussing each card. Very detailed!! For anyone who uses the Thoth deck, only one version of The Magus (The Magician) is analyzed here. The original Thoth deck has three different versions of The Magus. Recently, the deck was changed to include just one. There is at least one version available now that has all three versions included again. <br />A few of the Major Arcana cards have been moved to a different number or renamed. In most Tarot decks, Strength is #8 and Justice is #11. In the Thoth deck, Justice/Adjustment is #8 and Strength/Lust is #11. (Adjustment and Lust are terms used in the Thoth deck.) Judgment (#20) is called The Aeon in this deck. <br />The Minor Arcana are presented in one page descriptions - great details. Although I understand the reasons, the decision to have the Kings, Queens, Princes, and Princesses (The Royalty Symbols) in their own sections makes the book sometimes difficult to use as a reference during readings. <br />Overall, I do find this book very well written. Even with my minor complaints, I would still recommend this book. For the Thoth deck, it is the best book I've seen and superior to Crowley's own book about his own deck. Personally, I would not recommend it for use with other Tarot decks. Some of the symbolism discussed might be useful for general knowledge but not for other decks.	2001-08-12

Yota is totally in love with a really cute girl at his school. However, she is in love with his best friend. It's interesting that both of them view their romantic situations as hopeless. Moemi doesn't know Yota loves her when she confesses her love. As a result of his unrequited love and him crying for Moemi's broken heart, Yota ends up at a video store. ...in the adult section. He finds himself drawn to the videotape of Ai Amano. When he gets the tape home, Ai comes out of the TV to help Yota with his love life. <br />In a way, that might sound like a simple plot. There is much more to the story. I don't want to totally spoil the story details here. <br />Yota's last name is similar to the Japanese word for &quot;dateless&quot; and that's where his nickname comes from. Ai actually means &quot;love&quot; in Japanese. The name of the video store, Gokuraku, means &quot;paradise.&quot; <br />There is no warning printed on these collected volumes. When the chapters appear in Animerica Extra, there is a note about this being for mature audiences. Right now, the series has a long way to go before we'll see the ending. My latest issue of Animerica Extra has chapter 34, and I heard something about there being around 100 chapters. That's chapters, not volumes. This first volume has 8 chapters in it. <br />There is an anime OVA (made for video) and a live action movie based on this manga. The live action version is not available in America. <br />The adult tapes mentioned here are not the type we have in America. According to someone I know at a local Japanese import shop, tapes of girls describing what they'll do on a date are popular. The tape itself just has the girl's face since full nudity is illegal in Japan - at least for live-action. That's my understanding of it anyway. I haven't seen one for myself.	2001-08-12
US	51141218	R136HU4577O9EB	1569712158	607934294	Gunsmith Cats: Bonnie & Clyde	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Great Action Manga	This is the first volume of the manga series. At the time of this writing, there are only two issues left of the manga to be published, and that will be it unless Kenichi Sonoda decides to write more. <br />Rally Vincent and Minnie-May Hopkins are bounty hunters in Chicago plus they own a gun shop. Rally is the gun and car expert while May knows how to make explosives. There is also Becky who can dig up any information that might be needed to get a job done. <br />This volume deals with basic development of the main characters and later, Bonnie becomes the focus as she tries to get revenge for the injuries she blames Rally for. Compared to later volumes, this one is more graphic than the others, and I would consider this R-rated material. <br />There is much information in the series about cars and guns. I'm not an expert on either, but based on what I read in the letter columns in the individual issues, it seems to be very accurate. None of the letters are published in these volumes.	2001-08-11
US	51141218	R2JBRG71STWJSN	1569712077	543091988	Oh My Goddess!: 1-555-GODDESS (Oh My Goddess! (Numbered))	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Wonderful, Safe Manga	This is the one manga that is safe for all ages to read. No nudity or foul language. Even some manga that might seem as if it's for a young audience might have mild nudity. Nothing to offend people here. <br />I love this series because I can be a hopeless romantic, and perhaps I identify too much with Keiichi. <br />Keiichi is a college guy who has zero luck with women. While trying to call a friend to give him his messages, he accidentially calls a goddess help line. As a result, Belldandy appears so she can grant Keiichi any wish he wants. He's allowed one wish. Thinking this is a prank, he wishes that Belldandy be with him forever. Well, it's not a prank, and Keiichi now has a goddess as a girl-friend - forever. <br />There is an error on the back cover of the volume I have. It states that Keiichi was trying to order pizza when he calls Belldandy. In the anime series, he's trying to order food to be delivered. Here in the manga, it's just as I described it above.  <br />This is the first volume of the manga. Some parts are missing, but it doesn't affect the flow of the storyline. You'll have to grab past issues of Super Manga Blast to read the missing parts unless Dark Horse decides to publish them in a collected format. If you can read Japanese, the missing material is in volume 1 (I think) and volume 2 of the original Japanese volumes. I own a copy of volume 2 so I can only comment for sure on that one.	2001-08-11
US	51141218	R15NIA5ILY9UCI	0782128025	121622933	A+ Complete Study Guide	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Fairly good for the test, but annoying little details.	First off, so you know where I'm coming from, I am a somewhat severe computer geek. I've been working with PC hardware for 10 years (18 if you include TRS-80s and Apple II series). I just took the A+ because the certification is required for some jobs. <br />Overall, I felt the book was OK for the Hardware Core test. It was severely lacking on the OS part. I think personal experience really helped me on this. I have next to no Windows 2000 experience, and I've only glanced at a few books while considering study guides to update my MCSE. Fortunately, there was a nice balance of DOS and other versions of Windows. <br />My copy of this book must be an earlier edition because it did not have the corrections listed on the Sybex web site. The quickest way to tell if it's the earlier edition is to look at page 622. The last choice for question 8 lists the answer for the question. <br />I was cringing at various details as I read this book. Most of the parts that annoyed me should not affect the test outcome. I've already submitted corrections for some of these. On page 64, he says ISA slots are brown. On the hundreds of PCs I've worked on and built, ISA slots have always been black. EISA and VLB slots are brown. It's minor stuff like that. In the OS part of the book, I can understand leaving some details out so it doesn't get confusing for people who aren't familiar with the OS. For example, he does not mention every way of shutting down Windows. He focuses on using Shut Down from the Start Menu, but in Windows 9x, you can hit Ctrl-Alt-Del and select Shut Down. I mention this one because there is a question in the book about shutting down Windows and Ctrl-Alt-Del is one of the choices. If that were the answer, it should add \\"...and click on Shut Down.\\" You could argue that that is not the complete process and therefore it's wrong. This brings me to my next problem with the book. <br />I hate most of the questions in the book. Sometimes the answers are very clear, and othertimes, the answers might be only part of the process like in my gripe in the above paragraph. I hate the wording of most of the questions. It often left minor details out so I often had to second guess what they were really asking. I might have been thinking too hard too. :) However, I found questions on the real test to be vague too at times, but not as bad. <br />I primarily used this book and a study guide at brainbuzz.com to prepare for these tests. I passed both tests by more than 140 points, and I know this book did help with that even with my gripes.<br />NOTE: I recently saw a new edition of this book at a local book store - Deluxe Edition, I think. I quickly glanced at the description for the ISA slot. The error is still there. That's the easiest one to look for. Sybex was unable to contact the author when I reported these errors to them.	2001-06-02
