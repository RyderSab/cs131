I will read anything that Spencer-Fleming writes, but have some reservations about the way the series is going.  I am becoming a trifle bored with Clare, who seems to have no particular intellectual interests and is always willing to show off her army training at the drop of a hat.  I like the introduction of the bishop, who, although somewhat of a caricature, adds some tension to the relationship between Clare and Russ.  Of course, the sensible thing for her to do is ask for transfer to another location, but people in love are not sensible.  At the end when Russ decides to tell Linda of their attraction (and that is all that it is for the moment) he is out of character and out of his mind.  Of course, Clare could solve their dilemma by changing to a Methodist, but that would be too easy!  So we wait for the next installment and the rising crime rate of Miller's Kill.	2005-09-20

This area stretches from north to south in mid-Tennessee between Nashville and Knoxville where the mountains start to rise toward the Great Smokies. Anyone who thinks that the inhabitants are prototypes of The Dukes of Hazard will be surprised to read the truth about the music, history, crafts, culture, religion, and habits of a people proud of their heritage and sturdy as the mountains that surround them.  The book encompasses Civil War lore, religious revivals, moonshining, music, farming methods, and many more insights into the lives and history of the area.  It is at once scholarly and readable (those two characteristics do not always go together) and is a treasure of information for the student of Southern culture as well as an entertainment for the casual reader.	2005-09-09

This is one book that I don't check page numbers to see how far I have gone and how far I have to go to finish.  The ending really was a surprise, and it takes a lot to surprise me at this point.  I didn't see it coming.  The characterization is superior to most mysteries and the info on books is amazing.  This is not your usual \\"kick 'em in the belly\\" type of book.  Very high standard.  Dunning is not only a good mystery writer, but a good writer.	2005-08-17

When I was reading the last few pages, I still had to stop and think, Which is Jennifer and which is Sarah?  The other is that it is heavy on feather-dusting:  Evans has to have every detail explained to him with footnotes.  It is a way of telling what is happening, but it gets old to read through the lectures.  And, oh, yes, one other:  nobody seems to rest.  No naps.  They dart off around the world on a moment's notice and do impossible things.  The book comes off as a cartoon.  I stayed with it because of the environment angle, but I don't think I will want any more books by Crichton for a while.	2005-07-19

As a born Iowan who moved South, I have been to funerals in both places, and it is clear to me that Southerners have a lot more fun.  I lent this book to a friend who is looking after a sick husband and needed cheering up.  I may never see it again as it gets passed around.  The recipes are familiar and anyone who needs to know the temperature or size pan shouldn't be allowed in the kitchen.  Real Southern cooks have an instinct for these things. The list of pantry supplies is a must, as one can whip up a casserole on the spot without a trip to the market.  The \\"wa-uh\\" may have ceased a hundred and forty years ago, but Southern ladies still keep up the old traditions of hospitality and sharing of food, especially when the food has been prepared by loving and prideful hands.	2005-07-19

One sometimes loses track of good writing in the plethora of books that we read and forget about.  I had not read past the first page when I realized that this is the work of a master, a deliberate work of art.  The reader is captured by the style and what happens in the stories is not as important as how those happenings are revealed.  Then we realize we are reading about ourselves.  This is a participatory book in which the reader discovers self in the ordinary experiences of the characters--the fall of a leaf from a tree or a sound in the darkness of a summer night.  We are all products of accidental events, and wisdom is elusive as the wind.	2004-12-21

I like the characters so well that the plot is incidental.  This is my first book of Connolly's, but it won't be the last.  I rushed out to the library to check out four more.  The protagonist is cynical without being brutal, sentimental but not mawkish, and seems to be a genuinely decent man.  One wonders how he could have survived being an FBI agent for so long without becoming tainted by the arrogance and single-mindedness that we have been led to believe are the Bureau's major faults.	2004-10-20

He used his public persona to gain understanding and awareness of the plight of the Indians, exiled to reservations and continuously betrayed by the bureaucracies in Washington, D. C.  Handsome and proud, he knew the value of persistence and publicity. A reader who has not yet been introduced to the history of the Plains Indians can catch a glimpse of the frustration of the Sioux by machinations of the government, beginning with the Treaty of Fort Laramie and leading to the tragedy of the Battle of Wounded Knee. This is certainly not a complete history, but it is a good beginning.	2004-09-01

There was no real detective work, and what there was was sloppy.  This needed some serious editing and rewriting.  The characters were stereotypes and the dialogue stilted.  At least she didn't make the people in East Tennessee into brainless hillbillies.  The touchy-feely relationships made me want to gag, and this seemed to be more a romance novel that just happened to have a crime in it.  The sudden wedding of Miles and Katie made no sense, and there was no passion in it.  This is the first and last Coulter novel for me.  It was certainly easy to read (skim) and is best suited to people with low reading skills and bad taste.	2004-09-01

I wish the next one were available so I could continue, but, alas, I have to wait a while.  I advise any new readers to start with the first in the series and read them in order.  This book impressed me with the interweaving of past and present, showing how events have their fruition in unexpected ways, reaching into the future and intersecting other sequences in a kind of inevitability.  The only possible weakness I found was that I did not quite buy into the scene in which the Ketcham children are denied the ministrations of a physician.  I think any parent would have to be physically restrained, not merely intimidated, in order to delay going for help.  The romance between Clare and Russ is quite believable and a relief from the usual tripe that passes as romance.  These are mature, moral people who know exactly what is happening and the consequences that might obtain, yet feel the overpowering urges of their attraction for each other.  It is comforting to read of a strong friendship between a man and woman that is based on something other than hormones.	2004-08-08

This one not only presents a good yarn but allows us to see Kinsey in a different light. She is getting a little older, and gaining a little more maturity. She's still the hardened P. I. with a soft spot for those she cares about, she is still addicted to quarterpounders with cheese, and her wardrobe is minimal but practical. I don't want her to get hurt again, and I have a feeling that her new love interest is not going to work out. She couldn't stand having money. As for the story, most of it involves the slippery Reba, who is a shadow of Kinsey herself, tough but vulnerable, loyal to a fault, and not always making the best choices. It's a story in which everyone ends up where he or she should be, and it doesn't appear contrived. Now, for &quot;S&quot; is for.....	2004-08-01

I believe Louise Erdrich to be the best.  She not only tells a story that is witty, powerful, and compelling, but she draws the reader into the mind and culture of Indians, especially of the Chippewa of whom she writes.  Fred Manfred and Oliver LaFarge, to mention two, have written great novels about Indians; and certainly Tony Hillerman has given us insight into the religion and life styles of the Southwestern Indians, especially the Navajos, but these writers are still outsiders.  Erdrich is lyrical and brilliant and tells her story as an insider without bias or sentimentality.  This book and others of hers should be required reading by every student of American History.  Facts about treaties and population may be interesting in their own way, but they don't say anything about the soul of a people.	2004-07-20

There is no particular wisdom in this book, although it is rather amusing for a quick run-through.  As an English teacher, I have encountered some creative punctuation among students, and have also developed definite ideas about how punctuation should be used.  There are certainly rules, and if one learns the rules along with the grammar and usage that punctuation supports, there is no problem. Granted, almost no one but diehard purists knows the proper use of the apostrophe, but that shows only that it has been badly taught. Colons and semicolons have their own rules, and can best be conquered by avoidance. We are becoming a world of illiterates, and only the most fastidious of us will preserve the traditions that keep sentences from tumbling off the tracks like a head-on train wreck.

I have read a great deal about the Mormons, my interest spurred by the fact that two of my grandmother's first cousins were wives of John Doyle Lee, and it is incomprehensible to me that any modern woman would tolerate for one moment the abuse and subjection that the church imposes in the name of religion.  In the old days, most women were at the mercy of their husbands, but the brainwashing of today is criminal.

Espinosa is a loner and a philosopher who loves books and is generally misunderstood by his colleagues.  He has a talent for encountering numerous lowlifes, some on the fringes of society.  These characters and the contradictions in various clues make a good story, but what I liked best was the little turns of phrase that the author uses to describe the action and characters.  He is reminiscent of Raymond Chandler in this respect, and, also like Chandler, evokes a time and place.  We look forward to others by this author.	2004-03-20

One of the problems of writing about an event of which everyone knows the ending is keeping the suspense going, as well as giving sufficient background for the reader to understand the depth of the crisis.  The Salisbury cousins have been painstaking in their research, and have interspersed the narrative with information about weather, natives, history, and personalities so that we are caught up in the tension, pain, and struggle of the efforts of so many to bring serum to the isolated community under the worst possible conditions.  For readers concerned with heroism, as well as delineation of a time and place, this is a page-turner.	2004-02-13

The people who buy and read the book are for the most part already in agreement with him.  His greatest value is that he provides focus.  We all know the economy has gone south, education is in a crisis, we are disliked by the world community, the war has not turned out well, and welfare systems are in grave jeopardy.  He gives us reasons why these things happened, and then builds a structure for fixing the problems.  He does it with raucous humor and keen insight.  He also talks about his mamma, and so we know he is a good man.  This is a good handbook for Democrats and it would also be a good eyeopener for Republicans, if they could just open up their minds long enough to glimpse how the rest of the country lives.  Anyone who has lost his job, or can't afford health insurance, or is looking forward to Medicare and Social Security needs to understand what is happening and what can be done about it.	2004-02-03

I found too many contrivances to make this more than a formula plot for a rather ordinary B movie.  Peter Fleming had a grudge against the Olufsons, but I would have believed it more readily if he had been motivated simply because he was a policeman and he was doing his duty.  His handicapped wife was a cheap trick to get reader sympathy, and his treatment of her was abominable.  He also didn't treat his cohort very nicely, either.  I didn't mind the technical jargon pertaining to the plane, but found it beyond credibility that those two kids could actually fly that thing.  The ballet was there only to allow the girl to get a sprained ankle; the Nazis were portrayed as being stupid and careless.  This is a potboiler, but I still enjoyed most of the first 90%.	2003-09-08

I was reminded of Jane Austen in the long descriptive passages that so clearly invoked the individual personalities of the characters.  Without going into any details of the plot (I wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone), I would like to state that I was not entirely surprised by the ending.  The part that puzzled me the most, although I was grateful for the apparent accuracy, was Briony's experience as a student nurse and her performance when the soldiers arrived from Dunkirk.  Briony was imaginative and unpredictable.  Her behavior during the stern discipline and harsh reality of the hospital wards was not in keeping with her nature.  I found it difficult to believe that she could be so structured.  It was easy, however, to believe that she could not find the courage to admit the wrong she had committed against her dearest friends and relations.  As for the wrong itself, I think everyone was guilty--the adults for not questioning her more closely, the police for taking a child's testimony verbatim, Lola for not speaking the truth, painful as it might have been.  Briony was not the only one to seek atonement; she was surrounded by a conspiracy of silence.  Perhaps the theme is that there is no atonement, only the struggle to live with guilt.  In the end, MacEwan is writing about writers and, along the way, showing us how it is done.	2003-09-03

The characters are realistic and believable.  One sympathizes with them, in spite of their faults and cruelty.  I was disappointed in Mathilde's overly long confession to her daughter of a youthful love affair.  Why was she compelled to tell all on the night of her son's funeral when she had kept it a secret for two decades?  The dialogue was true, catching the cadence and syntax of the Cajuns.  Setting was done extremely well, and not overdone.  Imagery borders on the poetic.  Biguenet is a good writer, and we expect him to get better as time goes on.	2003-08-20

I think I enjoy the descriptions of setting and folkways more than the plots of his books.  This one was short on description of sky and mountains and weather.  Hillerman seems to have decided that since he has written so much of Navajo ceremonies and the nature of the people, that he doesn't have to tell us any more.  I felt a great lack of what I enjoy most.  I also felt that the book lurched along from an unprepossessing start in Washington D. C. through a series of events that never quite explained everything.  I expected more to be said of the ripoff of royalties for gas and oil, because it seemed to be introduced as an important problem early on.  This won't stop me from reading the next thing Hillerman writes, but I hope the next one is more organic in structure and contains the old poetic quality when he writes of the people and the land.	2003-08-20

Fleming seems to be settling into her setting and characters, and does a fine job of maintaining the tension between the protagonists.  This is an adult romance that seems entirely believable.  Russ is drawn to Clare's vitality and intelligence, but is also a responsible husband in love with his wife.  The helicopter incident is well done with what seems to be knowledgeable detail.  The bigotry of a ordinarily decent people is handled well.  The writer does not beat the drum, but lets us know her stance.  (I really dislike writers with an agenda.)

The author does some things very well--such as, being able to describe her characters in little gestures and believable dialog so that we know what they looked like without being told.  We know their attitudes, values, demons, likes and dislikes, and general comportment with no editorial slanting.  They are human beings with failings as well as strengths.  We even know the two absent characters, the murdered girl, and the chief's wife, who never appear but pervade the story with their presence.  One does not doubt the sincerity of Clare's devotion to her ministry, although the reader wonders at times why a woman with such rigorous training and discipline from her years in the armed service would be such a ninny as to rush headlong into the mountains so ill prepared (shades of the heroine entering a dark attic when a known killer is lurking in the house!).  She also seems to be too eager to manage other people's lives, although a certain amount of nosiness is required of the amateur detective.  The sheriff, who should have known better, seems to give out too much information to the perps he is interrogating.  All the cops I have known are pretty close-mouthed.  And I can't think of any good reason why Russ took her to his house for supper when they could have gone to an eatery in town.  Well, of course, we had to see his house and they needed a heart-to-heart, but that is a good way for a preacher, either man or woman, to lose a job and reputation.  Still, this was a good story and kept me going to the end.  How refreshing to find characters who are not super human!	2003-05-29

A fellow teacher of Norwegian heritage recommended it.  It blew me away, and now twenty-five years later, I read it again.  I had forgotten most of the details, but the effect remains--it is an incredible story of human survival.  It is a testimony to the law that says in war nothing goes as planned and if something can go wrong, it will.  It is also a testimony to the basic humanity and courage of ordinary people--the many who risked their lives to help Jan Balsrud when they could easily have left him for dead, as indeed he almost was.  His suffering, determination to survive, and ultimate acceptance of what seemed to be certain death before his final rescue are inspiring to those of us who have not been so tested.  The photographs that were included in the later edition were helpful and one can believe the entire story because of the documentation.  This is a book that makes fiction pale beside it.	2003-04-14

If this is basically a true story, then the man was suffering from delusions, disorientation, and distorted memory.  His escape from the Gulag was unusually easy, and as well as he was treated, difficult to justify.  He could not have survived without water as long as he said he did when crossing the Gobi Desert.  His crossing the Himalayas without proper clothing or gear is equally difficult to believe.  The sighting of the Yeti was a nice touch.  I wondered what the hurry was once the group was out of Russia.  Should they not have considered holing up for the winter in a friendly village?  And once they were out of the hospital, why did the narrator feel compelled to rejoin the army?  Surely he could have made other arrangements.  Why did he not keep in touch with his fellow travelers?  These questions persisted as I read about this amazing journey.  The writing is obviously ghost-written and has an English flavor to it.  The details recounted concerning birds, flowers, sounds, smells, etc., can be put down to poetic license, but the basic question remains:  did this really happen and was their suffering and deprivation really necessary?  There is no documentation to verify it.  One is reminded of the old joke:  I know that it is true, because he told me so himself.	2003-04-02

After the TV version I felt compelled to go back and re-read the book to find all the discrepancies and distortions that kept me shaking my fist at the TV screen and saying, \\"That wouldn't have happened that way!\\"  Hillerman writes a good mystery; but, more than that, he evokes a time and place in his kindly and careful delineation of the Navajo culture of the Southwest.  The tension among the various characters is sensitive and real.  No stereotypes here.  He is such a good writer that the writing does not draw attention to itself.

Victoria seems to be so helpless that she can't rebel against her past, yet her baby brings her to a sense of responsibility and purpose.  The two Guthrie boys are introduced to the evil that happens to people through no fault of their own. Ella needs help, and why didn't someone recognize this?  As a former teacher, I don't know why the problem Guthrie had with the Beckmans was not handled better.  The principal seems to have been a total wimp in face of parental anger (not a total surprise!).  As a matter of fact, teachers haven't been allowed to rack up a student against a row of lockers for thirty years, even in a place like Holt.  The sexual encounters seem to be included as a bow to popular expectation; none of these teachers was very discreet, and I find that very surprising.  Even in these liberal times, most teachers would be smart enough to outwit, at least for a while, the nosiness of a small town.  Any reader who has qualms over the description of the horse autopsy needs to understand that this is part of farm or ranch life, and not as offensive (to me, at least) as graphic descriptions of depredations against humans, which one encounters in some crime novels.  In spite of the flaws, I find this novel well written in that it evokes a time and place with sparseness yet preciseness of detail, and at the end the characters have moved outward and upward to a higher plane of understanding of themselves and their world.  It is at once realistic and idealistic, and I find it a pleasant surprise.	2002-08-20

This kind of authenticity always fleshes out a story.  The story itself, however, had some flaws.  The author seemed to have said to herself, &quot;How many things can I put into this to make it sell?&quot;  The extreme violence, crude language, cliffhanger crises, and stereotypical minor characters were distracting.  The mystery remains unsolved, the snake presumably gets away, and the bad guys get their comeuppance, but the motivation does not ring true. Why is the villain so obsessed with killing Mary Crow under such difficult conditions when it wasn't even his problem?  A smarter one would have hired a hit man, at the very least.  The mountain creature is right out of Stephen King; the snake pit is out of True Grit, and the grub-eating is from Follow the River.  If the reader wants a good yarn (and true) about women surviving in the wilderness, read Follow the River by James Alexander Thom.  I stayed with this one to the end, but except for the trees and flowers it was a waste of time.	2001-10-28

They are, however, totally believable, and even though the reader knows the ending (she finally makes it home), the book is difficult to put down.  Every footstep of the journey is vivid.  The author also manages to portray the Indians as human beings in spite of the gory details of the massacre.  Mary Ingles was a fourth great-grandmother of a friend of mine, and this makes the book more immediate for me.  My own great-great grandfather was survivor of a Shawnee massacre in the same area 20 years later.  I am astounded at the courage and endurance of these brave people who were our forebears.  As a writer, I was amazed at how many different ways Thom describes weather, terrain, pain, and terror.  Mary's decision to give up her baby to the Indian girl was a selfless, practical act, and her mental and emotional strength kept her from descending into a morass of romantic, sentimental, blubbering guilt.  This book should be required in American history courses as adjunct reading material.  It tells us what a history book cannot--the human side of the early development of this country.	2001-05-23

She presents a realistic picture of these fine, brave, proud people without the grotesqueness of Cold Mountain or the distortion of Deliverance.  This is not so much a mystery novel as it is a novel that happens to have a mystery in it.  Her characters are well-rounded and the setting is true.  My only quibble with it is her vagueness in the matter of firearms and their use.  I would like to have seen a closer connection between the use of the rosewood casket and the actual ballad.  Otherwise, this is a good one.	2001-04-07

It was too long, and I had the feeling that when the author got to WWII, he thought, &quot;All right, I have to bring this to an end,&quot; and whisked through a few decades  toward closure.  It was depressing, and no doubt accurate.  I do suspect,  however, that since it was written by a man, that he did not fully  understand or explain a woman's point of view, unless he meant that the  geishas are so traumatized by their training that they become neutered  emotionally.  I am glad I read the book, but I don't feel compelled to read  another one on the same subject.  This was enough.	2000-06-29

His description is not only accurate but lyrical; his characters are finely drawn; the plot is intricate and complex.  The intent is clear:  the missionaries are portrayed as being  self-righteous and hypocritical.  Only the child can make the true  connection with the natives, and he becomes a sacrificial lamb.

The book could have been much shorter with the assistance of a good editor.  I hope that readers understand this is not the typical experience of missionaries in  the field, but is exaggerated to suit the author's own agenda.  Although  the mother and daughters were distinctive in their characterization, I did  not find them memorable or even particularly endearing.  Rachel's cutesy  malaprops became annoying after the first two or three, and Adah's  miraculous regeneration seemed contrived.  If this book is intended to be  an indictment of the work of Christian missionaries, it has probably  succeeded very well; but the reader should remember that it is still just a  story of a howling mad father who brought his entire family to a place of  almost certain death.  One wonders why they stayed so long in the face of  all the dangers and starvation?  Why didn't they just get back on the plane  and go home to Georgia?  It is difficult to sympathize with fools.  The  political background is simply that--background for the story of the women,  who are led by circumstance with the result that heroism eludes them.  In  all fairness, this book lacks the flaws in credibility that Kingsolver  displays in previous books.  But it still needed liposuction to get rid of  the fat.	2000-03-11

Actually, it was, because Kay is more likeable and not as frustrated and enraged as she seems to become in the later  books.  I was disappointed in the denouement because Cornwell broke an  unwritten rule of the mystery-writing field:  don't have your villain  suddenly appear on the last page.  Introduce him early so the reader does  not feel cheated.  This villain was an obscure little guy who is not a  character at all in that he doesn't move or speak in the narrative.  The  romance with Boltz seemed pointless, since he just disappears out of the  story midway, and the child prodigy on the computer who makes the  surrounding adults look like a bunch of idiots has become a cliche.  I  don't know who thought of this first, but it's old stuff.  I found the  technical data interesting, but the plot was episodic; and the detail about  taking the bullets out of the gun every day was a plot device that stood  out like a red flag.  An experienced mystery reader sees that and says,  &quot;AHA!&quot;  Taken all in all, this novel makes a promise that has not  been fulfilled.	2000-01-31

It took me several days to finish.  The opening scene has Kay getting a letter from Benton a year after his death.  She goes into hysterics, vomiting,  breast-beating, etc.  This is a grown woman, not a teen-ager.  Where is her  self-control?  Why the angst, the agony, the foul language in a woman  touted as being smart, professional, and good at her job?  Her attachment  to Lucy is sick, and Lucy is out of control.  Where is her professionalism?   Pete has lost all his smarts and is merely crude, profane, and obnoxious.   Did Kay ever stop and ask herself why she has so much difficulty getting  along with people--that it might possibly be her fault?  I don't blame  Diane Bray for wanting to get rid of her.  The plot was loose,  coincidental, and at times almost non-existent.  The mystery of the  loup-garou was solved easily and the subplot of Bray's hostility was no  mystery at all.  Then Jay Talley shows up after page 300 and he and Kay  jump between the sheets in a fury of lust.  Give me a break.  Such  unpleasant people.  Who needs it?	2000-01-14

I was amused by Lucas's lack of literary knowledge.  If Hemingway said he wrote THE GREAT GATSBY, he was tweaking Joe, who wouldn't have known the  difference.  Joe is, however, no dummy, and learns his literary lessons  well.  Moreover, Simmons has learned his Hemingway.  This rings true, not  only for Ernesto but for Gellhorn, Fleming, and J. Edgar.  Really good spy  novels are hard to come by, but this one is a keeper.	1999-09-15

Dr. Field traces the political infighting and economic pressures on church leaders that led to the  separation of religious and secular cultures, a condition evident in our  present-day factionalism.  This is not a book for the faint of heart.  It  is detailed, precise, and reads like a mystery novel as we follow the  threads of intellectual, cultural, and religious thoughts from the Puritans  and Calvinists to the Unitarians and beyond.  Field's book brings us to  Emerson and the brink of the Industrial Revolution, another turning point  in American culture.  This book is a &quot;must&quot; for understanding the  intricacy of our religious expression.	1999-09-06

My initial annoyance with the heroine was that she is such a belly-acher:  ain't it awful what I have to do, dealing with  dead bodies and all.  I disliked the token love story with Wesley, who had  a perfectly nice wife and family, as being introduced for people who are  more interested in sex than in mysteries.  Her preoccupation with her niece  is obsessive.  So I find that this book is worse in all the above.  If Kay  Scarpetta finds her job so disagreeable, why doesn't she just quit and do  something else?  I'd like to see a positive attitude here.  I am not  dazzled by all the techno-garbage.  Let's have a heroine I can care about.   Scarpetta, resign and get a job in a factory and let Lucy live her own  life.	1999-06-15

When I finished it, I had endless images of walking through wet leaves.  Then I read THE BLACK FLOWER and it is wonderful.  Bahr is a master of his craft--he knows how to handle flashbacks, stream of consciousness, and lyricism on a level with Faulkner and Welty.  The images are haunting, and perhaps the theme is the loss and waste of war, not only for the young lives lost but for the women who were forever cheated of youth and love and family, who became old women walking among the graves on Sunday afternoons.  This is not about glory but death--the endless tragedy of aborted futures. Another thing Bahr has done superbly is that he has given his characters wit and uniqueness without their being grotesque.  I know that comparisons are odious, but the strange and distorted country people that Frazier's hero met on his journey did not ring true.  Frazier's metaphor was a disjointed and at times aimless journey, but Bahr's story is a jewel set in a time span of little more than a day, a compact yet expanded experience.   My own grandfather won a Medal of Honor at the Battle of Murphreesboro, so these stories are of personal importance to me.  (How was it, sir, when you were Bushrod's age?  How did you survive?  Why did you go in the first place?)  Howard Bahr not only knows what happened, but tells us what it felt like.  It doesn't get much better than this.	1998-04-10

Sharyn McCrumb has managed to write a good mystery without clinical sex and bad language and only a minimum of violence.  In fact, this is not exactly a mystery, but more like a novel that happens to deal with death.  And does it ever deal with death!  The author also manages to create characters who are not stereotypes.  We do wonder, however, what happened to Sheriff Arrowood who had such a harmless crush on Naomi Judd.  The little orphan Robsart boy was hardly a character at all..  The bond of friendship between the two old men seems contrived.  The author is obviously interested in sociology.  The style is not memorable.	1997-10-24

Like Capote's In Cold Blood, the principal characters are dead and cannot refute what he says about them.  How do we know that this is true?  We have only the author's word.  This book is not a murder mystery, but a novel that happens to have a murder in it.  Mostly, it is a gossipy look at Southern uppercrust society, with a good many &quot;stretchers&quot; as Mark Twain would say.  The incident of the dead cat and the ladies' luncheon is pure urban folklore.  We suspect that walking the dog is more of the same.  As for style, the storytelling and dialogue are fine, but it clunks a little in places.  How can an outsider ingratiate himself so thoroughly with the natives and not be sullied by the sleaze that seems to infect them?  Good thing for him that he went back to New York.	1997-10-20

What is glamorous about a four-day roll in the hay with a man she knows she will never see again?

It gives a wonderful depiction of the Japanese mentality and the power of tradition and family loyalty.  Its intercalary format allows us to see two stories as they unfold and finally merge.  The world that Guterson creates is so real that I read half the book before I realized it was fiction and not a true story.  I tried to find the island on a map, and contemplated the amount of research the author must have done.  Near the end of the book, I feared that Kabuo would be found guilty, and expected that Ishmael would present the evidence he had found in order to save him.  But when he did not, I decided it was totally in character for him to not do it.  He is a lost soul, a wanderer.  Perfect story, perfect ending.	1997-10-20

The author thinks of the most unlikely thing to have happen and then makes it happen.  Although I know this is fiction, I always expect a certain amount of credibility, so why does a young woman who has been employed for several years and who is supposed to be quite intelligent have only enough money saved to buy a car that won't start and leave town for destinations unknown?  And how can she arrange an adoption in one afternoon with a sleazy lawyer?  I know that this is meant to include single mothers, independent women, helping the great unwashed, the plight of refugees, Native Americans, abandoned children, and domestic abuse, but it seems pasted together and the characters fail to make me care about them.	1997-10-20

The writing is restrained and unsentimental, almost to the point of bleakness.  I wish Gaines would not be so clipped and obviously self-edited in his style.  Jefferson redeems himself and also the narrator, as well as Paul, the deputy.  It is a novel about hope and pride, not just for black people, but for everyone who faces a moral and spiritual dilemma.	1997-10-20
