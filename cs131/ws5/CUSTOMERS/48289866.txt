Okay, don't get me wrong: This book had plenty of action and filled in many untold story gaps left between ESB and ROTJ. But come on! Xizor considers telling a DROID to disrobe and take a bath with him? What kind of nymphomaniac is this guy?!! He constantly thinks about having sex with Leia from the moment he lays eyes on her, and the book itself mentions his past sex life way too many times for me to keep my lunch down safely. Read books by Brian Jacques or Aaron Allston instead; characters might kiss in those books, but they don't go as far as this one!	2002-02-20

Sabriel is an eighteen year young girl who is able to walk in Death, which is in the form of a river with nine gates you must pass through to reach the Great Beyond. She uses &quot;Charter Magic&quot; quite often, which is apparently the magic that binds her world together and prevents chaos. Other than that, the book is a must-read. Sabriel, after receiving a Dead messenger from her dead father, Abhorsen (there IS a reason that I capitalized &quot;dead&quot; and &quot;Abhorsen&quot;), goes on a quest to find her father and bring him back from Death. She gets through much peril to reach Abhorsen's House, where she hooks up with a Free Magic servant named Mogget, who is in the form of a cat. On the rest of her journey, she hooks up with a long-lost prince named Touchstone (so named by the sarcastic Mogget). She ends up, along with Touchstone and Mogget, having to defend her country from an evil Greater Dead named Kerrigor (that's Rogirek backwards with a variation; it's a long story). Will she succeed?Read the book and find out. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy/adventure/suspense combinations, or just anyone who loves to read (or can!).	2001-11-16

It's almost like Mr. Anderson was afraid to develop the characters beyond the original trilogy. They don't even use original dialogue half the time! Also, Mr. Anderson has a problem with killing off characters: namely, he can't. Admiral Daala survived against all odds one too many times for me to care anymore, and the way Callista attacks her is crazily improbable. Read the New Jedi Order instead, one of the characters might actually die.	2001-11-16

First of all, some general information. This book is set up in non-rhyming poem format, much like Out of the Dust. However, this book is also divided into chapters and parts. Secondly, my opinion. Like I said, this book is okay, but it has some strange things in it. First of all, what is up with the mother of the kids? She is totally ungrateful for the efforts of the protagonist. Also, it's kind of sick that she is a seventeen year-old mother with two kids. In her own words &quot;two kids got me confused enough to get me pregnant.&quot; What is up with that? Second, the protagonist's mom is a little obsessive and unparentlike. The mother of the protagonist is totally obsessed with sending her kid to college. Also, she only talks to her daughter about four times a day. If this is what the &quot;real world&quot; is like, I'll take fantasy books any day. Lastly, my recommendations. I would recommend this to those of you who like books with imperfect characters because they're &quot;more real.&quot; I would not recommend this book to people like me, who prefer a book where the characters are living either a good life, or a bad life that turns into a good life. This book offers neither. It would probably be better to read a fantasy book or something.	2001-10-01

This book was a very good addition to the Dragonriders of Pern series! First of all, the plot was excellent. Menolly, a young teenager, is very good at playing and singing music. However, her skills are out of place and unwanted in the Half-Circle Sea Hold where she lives. After her old mentor, a Harper named Petiron, dies, and a new Harper comes to replace him, Menolly's skills become evn less wanted. She runs away from the safety of her Sea Hold, and soon makes a discovery: The fire lizard, a creature of legend, actually exists! She ends up helping a fire lizard queen to save her clutch of eggs, and impresses nine of the many that hatch. However, danger still lurks. While out foraging one day, Menolly is caught in the Fall of Thread, a silver organism that devours alive anything it touches. She outruns the Thread for a while, but as it is closing in, she is rescued by a dragonrider, who takes her to Benden. There, she meets Lessa and F'lar, Dragonwoman and Dragonman of Pern, and makes a friend in Mirrim, a girl who has three fire lizards. Meanwhile, Elgion, the new Harper at Menolly's Sea Hold, finds out that MENOLLY was the prized apprentice Petiron wrote of. He sets out to find her, along with Robinton, Masterharper of Pern. Will they find her? Read the book to find out. This was a great book, one I would recommend to anyone who's dreamed of getting the best that they deserve.	2001-08-28

In a nutshell, it tells you everything you didn't hear about yet, like how Pern was discovered, and what happened the eventful day that Landing was evacuated. The stories are all incredible, but my personal favorite is the story about the discovery of Pern. In it, we discover what PERN stands for, how fire lizards came to be known about, and how the Oort cloud was found and theorized about. I also liked the story about the Evacuation of Landing, an important event that set up the historical colonization of the Northern Continent. The dolphins evacuate everyone by pulling them along in boats. It's really a good story! I recommend it to anyone who likes Science Fiction, anyone who likes anthologies, or anyone who likes to read.	2001-08-22

This book was even better than Redwall and the Outcast of Redwall! It has everything you could expect from a Redwall novel: Evil, Action, Adventure, Humor, and Mouthwatering Food. The plot is as follows: Mariel and Dandin, along with a new friend called Major Meldrums, are in serious trouble. They were caught while resisting the evil Foxwolf, Urgan Nagru, his mate Silvamord, and their hordes. So, when Martin the Warrior visits Joseph, Mariel's father, in a dream, and tells him to help Mariel along with four other Redwallers, Joseph sets out immediately. The Redwall Rescue Team makes a new friend in Finnbar, a sea otter, who steals his old ship back from searats. They journey to Southsward, the beautiful land that Foxwolf has taken over. There they encounter toads, warrior hedgehogs, and (gasp) Foxwolf. Can they save Mariel, Dandin, and Meldrums in time? Read the book to find out. I recommend this book to Redwall readers, fantasy readers, and just plain readers.	2001-08-22

It has just about all you need to look for: A strong plot with smatterings of suspense, adventure, and mystery, wonderful characters described so well you can almost hear them talking, and a map at the beginning so you can track the journeys of the characters. The plot is this: Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit, is visited one day by Gandalf, a roving wizard. Although Bilbo insists he does NOT want the adventure Gandalf offers, Gandalf decides that Bilbo is perfect for the job, and brings along thirteen dwarves when next he comes to call. The dwarves are going to go off and reclaim their stolen home(and treasure) from a dragon named Smaug. They set off the very day after their visit at Bilbo's, with Bilbo a nervous and reluctant member of their party. Although Bilbo often wishes to be at home with the kettle singing for tea, he gets none of it as he witnesses Gandalf outsmarting trolls, gets taken down to Goblin Town in the bowels of the Misty Mountains, finds a powerful Ring that makes the wearer invisible, and has to fight giant spiders to save the dwarves. Eventually, all the dwarves are captives of the Mirkwood elves, and Bilbo is trapped inside their castle, always wearing the Ring to avoid discovery. He eventually rescues the dwarves in an ingenious plan: floating them down to the Dragon's mountain in empty barrels discarded by the Mirkwood elves. Bilbo and the dwarves are received ecstatically by the residents of a lake town near the mountain, but soon after Bilbo's birthday they are off to the mountain. Bilbo gets them all inside with a vital clue provided earlier, and drives the dragon nearly mad with frustration. The dragon is eventually slain by a lake townman, who convinces his townsfolk that the treasure is now rightfully theirs. This leads up to a climactic battle of five armies. This is a marvelous book for anyone who needs an escape from life's dreariness. I would recommend it to anyone who is old enough to read.	2001-08-21

It has the best qualities of a science fiction book, and it has nothing that one could argue with reasonably. The plot is this: Menolly, a young girl, has at last been recognized as a wonderful musician, and is sent immediately to the Harper Hall of Pern. There, she encounters all sorts of surprises, such as that the instrument she picks as the best of a roomful for herself was once the Masterharper's, or that there is so little everyone knows about fire lizards, intelligent flying reptiles of which Menolly has nine. She makes friends in Camo, a dimwitted kitchen assistant who loves her fire lizards, and Piemur, a fellow student. Over the time she spends at the Harper Hall, Menolly grows into a masterful musician, and earns the right to become a Journeyman. This book is good because there is no magic, so it won't offend any church. It has marvelous plot dexterity and, well, rhythm. I would recommend this book for searchers of books beyond Harry Potter, SF lovers, or anyone who enjoys a good read.	2001-08-16

This book is quite sacreligious(and that's putting it mildly). It says in its plot that God was not the true creator of the universe, that he was an angel who merely claimed he had. The &quot;true&quot; creator was unknown. Anyway, the plot. it turns out that Lyra was taken by Mrs. Coulter, and secreted away in another universe, in a cave. Will and the two angels from the end of The Subtle Knife go to rescue her. Meanwhile, Lord Asriel is assembling an army to attack the kingdom of God, destroying the so-called false creator and his &quot;henchangels.&quot; Along the journey, the Subtle Knife will be broken and repaired, ghosts will fight the living, death itself will be no longer a bad thing, and so many shocking changes will occur that the characters are hardly recognizable from the ones we first met in the first two books. If, and this is a big IF, you can ignore the sacreligious content and tell yourself it's only a work of fiction, this is an extraordinary novel, with a plot so complex I can't tell you anything more without spoiling something.	2001-07-03

First of all, Robinton, the eventual Masterharper of Pern, gets a woman pregnant when he's unmarried. Some of you might have problems with that, as I did. Second, the language in the book is uncommon to rare, but it's still in there. Some people might take offense with it.  Now, I've gotten the problems out of the way, so let's go on to the book. The story is good, with Robinton being a musical genius from age one on, but being ignored by his father. His mother encourages him to play, sing, and compose music, which he does with ease. He makes a friend in F'lon, a dragonrider, as he grows. He gets promoted to journeyman, falls in love, and is later made Masterharper, the highest honor for a musician on Pern. However, not all is happy on Pern. A vicious man named Fax takes over his Hold with several lightning blows, and starts to take on more property, opposing harpers and dragonriders all the way. Robinton's loyal friends, including F'lon, his sons, F'lar and F'nor, a mysterious spy named Nip, Nip's apprentice, Tuck, and others aid him in the trying times of Fax's period as Lord Holder of High Reaches. Many loved ones die, but Robinton, while refusing to forget them, moves on with his life. All this adds up to one of the best fictional stories about music I've ever read. I would recommend this book to musicians, fantasy lovers, and anyone who has read The Harper Hall of Pern(and if you haven't, you should read it!).	2001-07-02

I mean, why does it have to be in there, anyway? Some people might argue that it's a part of life, but sleeping with someone when the two are not married? If that's a part of life, it shouldn't be. Anyway, I would recommend this novel to anyone if you can deal with the above topics, or do not feel objectionable towards them. Myself, I read it to learn about Pern's earliest history. If you really feel objectionable to the flaws (like I was), and decide not to finish the book (although you should;the ending is pretty good), then I would recommend The Harper Hall of Pern, or maybe Chronicles of Pern: First Fall.	2001-06-28

This book was the first Redwall book I read, and this book made me want to read the others. It does a close look at the roots of good and evil, represented physically by Veil Sixclaw and Sunflash the Mace. Looking at Sunflash, Brian Jacques shows good as trying to eliminate evil for the preservation of good, but he also goes farther than that. He also shows good as kindness to those one meets, and a willingness to live life in a simple way, taking joy in things that are &quot;real&quot; accomplishments, like growing and harvesting your own food, or passing out jobs to those who are the most skilled and just in that field. Brian Jacques shows evil in Veil Sixclaw as starting young, possibly existing at birth because of the evil of a parent or both parents. But, once again, Brian Jacques goes deeper than that, showing that evil is also acting selfishly, doing things just for yourself, or just for the sake of cruelty. Veil is cast out of Redwall for attempted murder, and his faithful caretaker, Bryony, always willing to see good in her surroundings, goes after him, trying to bring him to good. Veil hooks up with his father, Swarrt Sixclaw, who is the source of evil Sunflash is determined to destroy. Even when surrounded by evil, though, Veil proves that a little good might just exist in those thought to be evil. This book is great for fantasy lovers, but also for those who wish to look at a rather different view of good and evil.	2001-06-28

I was expecting something demonic and satanic based on the cover illustration, but I guess I should have heeded that old maxim: Don't judge a book by its cover.                     This is a story that is an adventure/suspense/humorous novel, with solemnity and comedy mingling freely. A distant world with plenty of fantasy characters and the like has been set up as a tourist attraction. Guests are encouraged to fight battles against the &quot;Dark&quot; Army, really not what it seems. They will eventually confront and defeat the Dark Lord.                     This year's Dark Lord is Derk, a simple man who would rather breed new and fantastic animals than his task, to disguise himself, his house, a group of rowdy prisoners, and even his kids as or having to do with the Dark Lord for the upcoming tours. Unfortunately, a dragon wounds Derk, putting him temporarily out of commission. This leaves the task of tour preparation to his children.         That's about all I can say about the book without giving away a surprise, and the book is stuffed with them. I will say this: At least try this book, and you'll be pleasantly surprised, not only throughout the book's plot, but at its superior quality. This is better than Harry Potter and Redwall combined.	2001-05-26

For those of you who would rather something more like Le Morte D'Arthur, I would suggest something else. For those like me, who enjoy different views of a story that are still true to it, this is a masterpiece.           It centers around Terence, a boy raised in a hermitage since birth, his only company a hermit who sees the future clearly and the present dimly. While checking his animal traps, Terence discovers the soon-to-be-Sir Gawain. Returning to the hermitage, he learns from the hermit that he is to go with Gawain to Camelot, where Gawain will be knighted and Terence will be his squire. Gawain battles and kills an evil, hungry knight who comes to the hermitage, and then is granted a boon by Trevisant, the hermit. The boon is that Gawain's strength will rise and set with the sun. Soon, Terence and Gawain set off.            On their way to Camelot, the two discover Tor, a young man who wishes to become a knight and joins them. On arriving at Camelot, Arthur nearly sends off Tor, but Merlin advises him otherwise, and Tor will be knighted if he proves himself in a coming battle. Gawain is knighted for his action against the hungry Sir Hautubris.            A battle with five rebel kings comes up, and Terence helps it to be won with the aid of a sprite named Robin. On the return of Arthur and his knights, Tor is knighted for his action against the attacking kings. This happens right before a white hound and white hart go dashing through the dining hall, prompting Tor, Gawain, and Terence to go after them at the urging of a mysterious ugly woman.              Many things happen on their quest after the two albino animals, including Tor's getting a squire, Plogrun, and Gawain and Terence's temporary entrance into the Seelie Court, a fairy kingdom. Gawain falls in love with Ganscotter the Enchanter's daughter Lorie, is proclaimed the Maiden's Knight, and leaves. Terence later learns a surprising truth about himself, and saves King Arthur's life.              This is an excellent book, and I recommend it to anyone with an imagination.	2001-05-22

It might because it is heavily involved with druids who use their powers to travel through time gates. Polly O'Keefe is caught in the time gate so that she can easily go from her time to 3000 years ago and back again. There are some advantages to this, however: She is able to learn the ancient language of the area and communicate back then, and her grandparents get a dog that comes into their time and decides to stay as a protector and friend. On the downside, the ancient druids are seriously considering sacrificing Polly to their gods to end a drought! This all leads up to a scene with her, the local bishop, a friend called Zachary Gray, the dog, and a snake all trying to survive 3000 years before their present! This is a wonderful book, but the druids might bring some doubt to the minds of others. Nevertheless, I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a combination of realistic fiction, fantasy, and science fiction.	2001-04-11

It acts as a beginning and an introduction to concepts from later books, but is also a great story in itself. Meg Murry is once again mixed into a quest involving transitions through time, space, size, and form. Charles Wallace is ill, and Meg learns from a cherub called Proginoskes that it is being caused by forces of evil. She must complete three tasks in order to save him from the Echthroi that are causing his sickness. Her friend Calvin ends up joining the group of Meg and Proginoskes, and they go to Charles Wallace's school to see his principal. There, they stumble upon the first task: Name the correct Mr. Jenkins(the principal) out of three, two of whom are Echthroi. She completes this task, only to shoot off on the next along with Proginoskes, Calvin, and Mr. Jenkins. They eventually end up in one of Charles Wallace's mitochondria, trying to rid it of the Echthroi. To find out if they succeed, read the book.

It has plenty of action, a detailed world that covers every category a proper fantasy world should have, going from a magic banking system to a magic school to magic candy... even to magical items for practical jokes! The basic plot is as follows:  Harry Potter is orphaned around his first birthday. Little does he dream that he was the major cause of downfall for the most evil wizard who lived! After spending years with the fiendish Dursleys (his aunt, uncle, and cousin), Harry receives a letter telling him that he is a wizard and has been accepted for schooling at Hogwarts, the best magical school in Britain. Soon, he is off to buy the most interesting school supplies he's ever seen (potion ingredients and dragon hide gloves, to name a few), followed by a long, eventful train ride to Hogwarts, a huge, castle-like school with dormitories for the students. He is thankfully sorted into Gryffindor, the best of the four school houses (the others are Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin). An amazing year begins, in which Harry becomes a member of the Gryffindor Quidditch team (a sport of broomstick fliers), makes enemies in Draco Malfoy and Professor Snape, and makes friends in Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. The year finishes with a climax so amazing and interesting, you'll have to read it to fully satisfy your imagination.

Trunn's messenger is turned away, and a few days later, an invasion fleet of warships that stretches as far as the eye can see arrives. Lord Stonepaw and his devoted hares are in desperate need of Brocktree's help.              Meanwhile, Brocktree has teamed up with a hare maiden on his journey. They get wind of the invasion and start to round up all the fighting creatures they can find. This leads to an outrageously funny battle with a large, Scottish-sounding hare in order to gain his help. Later, of course, it leads to the climactic battle against Ungat and his troops. This book has everything for a Redwall, fantasy, or book fan. It has humor, battles, rich dialogue and character personalities, and really excellent poetry. All in all, this book is for anyone who likes to read.	2000-12-11

The House of the Seven Gables was a very intersting book, full of suspense, surprises, and even a little humor. Here is the basic plot: The story starts in 1692, when a man named Matthew Maule is hung for witchcraft by a vicious member of the Pyncheon family. Before he dies, though, Matthew screams, &quot;God will give him blood to drink!&quot; After the death of Maule, his property is acquired by the same Pyncheon who saw him to the gallows. This Pyncheon dies mysteriously at his house-warming party, and the curse of Maule sticks with the Pyncheons. The previously mentioned Pyncheon had a house(incidentally, with seven gables), which was eventually possessed by the main character, Hepzibah Pyncheon. Hepzibah must set up a cent shop to buy her bread, and her main customer is a hungry, gingerbread-purchasing little boy. Her load lightens with the arrival of her young cousin, Phoebe, but the plot thickens when Hepzibah's brother Clifford comes to stay. Her other cousin, the vile Judge Pyncheon, acts very oddly toward Clifford from the moment Clifford arrives. I won't tell you how the book ends, but I sure liked it, and I feel it proves that the evils of a family can be thwarted by a few members.	2000-12-08

It has explosive battles, interesting strategy maneuvers, and a good plot. The story is essentially this: Wedge Antilles, a Rebel pilot, has decided to reforge Rogue Squadron, the group of pilots who destroyed the Death Star and fought at Endor. The new batch of pilots include Corran Horn, a Corellian, his wingmate Ooryl Qrygg, a Gand, Lujayne Forge, a woman from Kessel, and Bror Jace, a cocky pilot whose arch rival is Corran. The book focuses mainly on Corran, who mainly finds himself wrapped up in battles against the Empire's not-so-hot pilots. However, the plot really twists when he is rescued after being disabled. His rescuer is a woman named Mirax who has a very unusual connection to Corran... The tension mounts when Rogue Squadron is asked to lead the assault against the Imperial stronghold of Blackmoon. To find out how the book ends, you'll just have to read it yourself. But remember, this is only the start of the saga, so the adventure is just beginning!	2000-12-08

I thought it was interesting how it included an infusion of Minnipin history.     The basic plot is this: a candy-maker named Muggles finds herself mixed into a mystery that starts when she sees lights on a nearby mountain early in the morning. No one but Muggles and the so-called village oddballs saw them, so they have a hard time convincing the town of it, especially the Periods, an important group of Minnipins.       Faced with banishment, Muggles and the others leave the town, only to find that the lights were fires made by the age-old enemies of the Minnipins.       Will they manage to stop the enemies and alert their people? You'll just have to read the book and see, though I will say this: Not all is as it seems with the Minnipin history and hierarchy.	2000-11-28

I have never read Tamora Pierce before, but you can bet I am now! Veralidaine(a.k.a. Daine) is a very interesting character, who lives in a world where magical abilities are common and an ancient barrier between mortals and immortals is about to break. Daine has magical powers, but they are a little out of the ordinary, because she has so little control over them. She is occasionaly visited by a badger in her dreams, who gives her advice. There are hints about something dark from her past that has her worried, but I'm not telling what it is. To find out(and start your Pierce collection), buy this book. It's a definite must read!	2000-10-09

It mainly takes place on a magical island which you can access for nine days every nine years through a portal in an abandoned train station(the portal is called a gump,for future reference). The island is ruled by a King and Queen, who have a son a while into their reign. Unfortunately, the Prince's nannies decide to take him to the portal so they can glimpse the outside world they came from. They go out into the nearby city after a fish and chips smell comes that reminds them of their childhood. While outside, the child is kidnapped, which the nannies don't discover until just as the gump is closing.                Nine years later, a rescue party is sent to bring back the Prince quickly, the members being a wizard, a giant(who is made invisible for security purposes), and a fey, a human who has a magical knack for growing plants. At the last minute, a hag is allowed to go as well.               I've left out a lot, but the plot is so complex and interesting that you'll have to read the book yourself. Just for the record, though, this is definitely one of my Top Ten Favorite Books.	2000-10-09
