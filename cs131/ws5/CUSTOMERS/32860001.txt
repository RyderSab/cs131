Rachael Ray hosts cooking shows on the Food Network, and she has authored a number of cookbooks. While I have neither seen her show nor read her other books, her personality shines through in this book. The book is written with a whimsical sense of humor and an almost childlike glee, yet at the same time it has a certain kind of elegance to it.<br /><br />These are intended to be easy meals, but they by no means sacrifice quality for convenience. Ms. Ray has a wonderful sense for which corners you can cut and which you can't. I always felt, when making recipes from this book, that she had picked exactly the right ingredients to substitute pre-packaged foods for--and exactly the right ones not to substitute.<br /><br />She also has a marvelous sense for balancing flavors. I sometimes find the flavor of pesto to be too heavy for my liking, but it's just perfect when balanced with the tartness of lemon in the lemon-pesto dressing. Spinach isn't my favorite leafy green vegetable, but when cut with artichoke and dried tomato it's fantastic.<br /><br />The recipes are simple and easy to make. They often call for loose amounts such as \\"a handful\\" of frozen peas, but only in cases where it really is that simple--Ms. Ray doesn't leave you hanging without a guide (and she usually gives both loose amounts for more experienced cooks and actual measurements for beginners).<br /><br />Midnight snacks are often designed for one or two people, while meals are usually designed for four to six. Quite a few simple menus are provided. There are a few pretty color photos in the middle of the book, but otherwise no photos are provided. We found the foods to be quite colorful and attractive, by and large.<br /><br />In short, I wholeheartedly recommend this cookbook. It's a wonderful source of delicious food. The meals are satisfying without being loaded down with fat; toward the healthy end of the spectrum without being \\"diet food\\" in the pejorative sense. Plenty of extra-virgin olive oil (\\"evoo\\" as she calls it) gets used and a whole lot of colorful vegetables, and you won't be hurting for such flavor-filled ingredients as sharp cheddar, bacon, and avocado.n olive oil (\\"evoo\\" as she calls it) gets used and a whole lot of colorful vegetables, and you won't be hurting for such flavor-filled ingredients as sharp cheddar, bacon, and avocado.	2005-06-08

Bell starts from the assertion that anyone can learn to craft a good plot. Whether you prefer to plan every detail of your stories in advance or fly by the seat of your pants, you can still learn all the elements of an engaging story and use them to draw your reader in. Bell has spent a great deal of time analyzing the plot structures of those books that consistently draw people in, and he has come up with a number of systems, theories and exercises which he shares in this book.<br /><br />Bell addresses just about every aspect of plotting I could think of, from \\"What's a Plot, Anyway?\\" to generating ideas, dealing with beginnings (and middles, and endings), handling individual scenes, crafting complex plots, integrating character arc into plot, different systems of crafting plot, revising plots, plot patterns, plot problems, cures for plot problems, and even checklists to go through to make sure you're remembering everything as you write your book.<br /><br />One of Bell's major contributions to plot theory is his \\"LOCK\\" system, which stands for Lead, Objective, Confrontation, Knockout. In order to have a gripping plot you must have a lead, he must have an objective, there must be confrontation, and the ending must have \\"knockout power.\\" There are a million-and-ten possible variations on this simple structure, but this basic idea alone can help a struggling writer to get a grip on the basics of plot.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"Plot & Structure\\" for anyone who writes or plans to write fiction. It's been a while since I sat down to write fiction, but this book makes me want to sit and work on a novel right this moment. It's clear, coherent, practical, and immensely useful to any student of the craft.	2005-06-08

It's meant to help people who really know nothing about the web and about blogging create something that looks nice and accomplishes whatever purpose they have in mind for it. And in this, I believe this book succeeds beautifully.<br /><br />Since you can so easily find a listing of book topics in the information Amazon provides, I'll just mention some of the things that particularly caught my attention in this book. One of those was the section on blogs. None of the other HTML books I've read have discussed the issue (probably because this is the most recent of them, put out in 2004). Not only does McFedries get into the how of blogging, but he also gets deeply into the social and historical details. There's plenty of information on formatting, programs, services, etc., but there's also great stuff in here about finding and building your audience, focusing on a topic or two, deciding on your posting frequency, writing interesting entries, getting along with other bloggers, and so on. I read this section with rapt attention.<br /><br />Some CIG and For Dummies books make the mistake of providing what I call \\"perishable resources.\\" That is, they tell you about a couple of specific hosting providers or whatever. I refer to these as perishable because by the time you read the book those companies have probably shut down, been bought, or changed enough that everything is different. For the most part McFedries doesn't make that mistake. Instead he tries to tell you how to find this sort of information on the web yourself, so you'll be able to figure out who is most currently a good choice.<br /><br />There's a chapter in here on \\"the elements of web page style.\\" Before I got to this chapter I was a little worried (this is where that intro line about the review score comes in). There are a lot of sites out there on the web that go crazy with wild fonts, bold and italics all over the place, frobbies that only work on one browser type or another, lots of huge images that take forever to load, horrid noises that play without asking first and scare your cats off of your lap (okay, I have some personal pet peeves here), and so on, and it seemed to me like all of McFedries' enthusiasm for the web tools at one's disposal could contribute to that. But then he wrote this wonderful chapter in which he explains things to help you make your web page appeal to visitors, and he covers a lot of these things in there.<br /><br />I think this is a fantastic introduction to web site and blog creation--in particular the wide world of blogging, since there are so few other resources on that subject. I hope that McFedries continues to do revised versions of this book as the need arises, because this is a valuable resource.es out there on the web that go crazy with wild fonts, bold and italics all over the place, frobbies that only work on one browser type or another, lots of huge images that take forever to load, horrid noises that play without asking first and scare your cats off of your lap (okay, I have some personal pet peeves here), and so on, and it seemed to me like all of McFedries' enthusiasm for the web tools at one's disposal could contribute to that.

One of the things that many writers find hardest about getting published (apart from getting published itself!) is promoting their work. Writers generally want to write, not be publicists, and yet in this day and age it's rare to find a publisher who'll truly market your book for you. As the saying goes, if you want it done right you have to do it yourself. That's where Francine Silverman's \\"Book Marketing from A-Z\\" comes in.<br /><br />Francine Silverman runs an inexpensive book promotion newsletter for writers: [...] In it she collects all sorts of war stories from her readers--success stories, ideas, failures, and so on. In \\"Book Marketing from A-Z\\" she has collected many of those tips and stories (from more than 300 authors!) in a handy guide organized alphabetically by topic.<br /><br />I admit it--promotional tips aren't generally what I consider riveting reading. I'm one of those writers who are afraid of people and find promotion and publicity quite difficult, so the subject is a bit daunting. Yet by the time I got halfway through I was voraciously reading each entry in its entirety and feeling all fired up on the topic. There are just so many great ideas in here that it's hard not to get your imagination going.<br /><br />This book really does cover everything. Want to consider advertising? Authors sound off on the effectiveness of various sorts of ad campaigns from Amazon promotions to Google ads. Not sure how important a good book cover is? There's plenty of information on that, too. Authors go into their experiences with book reviews, book signings, branding, conferences, contests, discounts, giveaways, gimmicks, donations, dual career promotion, internet outlets, organizations, pre-publication promotion, speaking engagements, tie-ins, and much much more.<br /><br />Some of the contributing authors offer contradictory advice, which, oddly enough, I consider a plus. After all, not everyone's experiences will be the same. This allows you to try to figure out which things will best apply to your own situation and work accordingly.<br /><br />In all, I found this to be not only a highly informative and useful book, but also a fascinating read. I think it will be of great value to any writer looking for ways to sell a book, whether you're self-published or you've published through more traditional means. I'd also recommend the book to those writers still in the process of looking for a publisher, as many of the contributing authors impart quite a bit of wisdom on that part of the process as well.figure out which things will best apply to your own situation and work accordingly. <br /> <br />In all, I found this to be not only a highly informative and useful book, but also a fascinating read.

The format of Mark Ruskin's \\"Speaking Up\\" is designed to be very non-threatening to the casual reader. It's meant to be simple and easy to absorb. Each section starts out with some talk about a type of person or interaction and the sorts of problems that can arise. This is followed by a list of words to use, phrases to use, words to avoid, and phrases to avoid. I think this is very handy--words can come loaded with all sorts of emotional connotations, and it's true that some words and phrases can make things worse or better. By listing such things out Ruskin gives us a toolbox from which to construct our own solutions to problems.<br /><br />Next the entry provides a sample script for handling the situation along with a few words about how the scenario might proceed. This is followed by responses to anticipate and how you might reply to them.<br /><br />\\"Speaking Up\\" truly encourages you to work to solve problems. It would be easier to simply teach you to say the right things, but this book goes further than that. It encourages you to work hard to solve problems in a way that will make you and those around you happy, or at least satisfied. It explains things so you'll understand why people respond the way they do in certain situations.<br /><br />It makes things straightforward and easy. There are no in-depth psychological discussions, although you can tell this man truly knows what he's doing in that area. There are no treatises on interpersonal relations, although again, you can tell that Ruskin really does know his stuff. He also knows when to give a few simple instructions and let them speak for themselves.<br /><br />The book encourages wonderful approaches to teamwork, standing up for yourself, and so on. It teaches you not to take abuse lying down, but it also shows you that things such as criticism and owning up to your mistakes are important. Ruskin then goes on to explain how you can use even unmerited criticism as an opportunity for learning and developing a better relationship with others.<br /><br />I could go on for a while about this book, but hopefully I've already made my case. This is a truly useful book, and it encourages attitudes that could make any workplace or household easier--if not downright pleasant--to be in. It's one of those rare books that I find myself wanting to give to everyone around me to read.eveloping a better relationship with others. <br /> <br />I could go on for a while about this book, but hopefully I've already made my case.

When we have managed to cook, it's been mostly simple stuff. This year we took a four-day weekend to celebrate our anniversary, and we decided to cook up a true feast on Monday. This seemed the perfect opportunity to test out Andy Husbands and Joe Yonan's \\"The Fearless Chef: Innovative Recipes from the Edge of American Cuisine.\\" Reading through the recipes, they looked like exactly our kind of food; we couldn't wait to try them out.<br /><br />One of the recipes turned out absoluteley spectacularly--a soy glaze that we put over noodles. Other recipes were good but not great; a mango and cabbage salad and some beans both tasted a bit unbalanced in flavor. In particular, the beans tasted overwhelmingly of the beer that went into them (I'm sure some would see that as a plus!).<br /><br />Dessert is where the excitement came in. We made a bananas Foster-like recipe that involved a full cup of rum (I had to triple-check the amount because I found it so hard to believe). When we opened the oven at the end of the baking time I heard a whooshing sound and the slam of the oven door. Then I smelled burnt hair. I whipped around, and when my husband turned to face me all I could say was, \\"umm, you should look in a mirror.\\" His eyebrows and eyelashes, and the front row of his hair, had all been burned partially off. A gout of flame had apparently shot straight out of the oven when he opened it up.<br /><br />Nothing like that has ever happened to us before.<br /><br />Dessert was still edible, believe it or not, but once again, just like the beans, the taste of alcohol was so overwhelming that I almost couldn't taste anything else. And no matter how much I love that soy glaze, I can't quite get past that fireball.	2005-04-26

The language has a sort of poetic feel to it, and is extremely honest and open--both about writing in general and about Ms. Sellers' own life and experiences, when she needs to use them to illustrate a point. She isn't afraid to make some straightforward and, most likely, unpopular points that probably need to be made.<br /><br />Ms. Sellers is a teacher, and she has had many years of teaching others--and herself--how to develop a writing life. She believes that one should approach writing as though it were a lover. If you fall in love with writing, time slows down. If you fall in love with writing, you make the time for it. If you fall in love with writing, it's easier to sit and pay attention to it. If you don't love your writing, then why should you expect it to treat you well?<br /><br />You'll find plenty of exercises in here, though they may not be what you're used to expecting from a writing book. One of my favorites involves drawing up a rigid schedule for your writing the way so many other books tell you to, then drawing up a ten-year plan that progresses along the lines of, \\"year one: get feet wet.\\"<br /><br />Not everyone will be able to appreciate what this book has to offer. Some people really do just want to approach their writing as a regimented thing, and they'll scoff at Ms. Sellers' romantic (though surprisingly practical, really) viewpoint. Not everyone who doesn't actually want to write wants to hear that they really don't want to write, and they probably wouldn't like it. People who are bound and determined to believe that they're undiscovered geniuses whose work can't be improved upon, and that the people who offer them suggestions for improvement or reject their work are idiots, might not like hearing that a different attitude could benefit them.<br /><br />But for everyone who truly wants to get somewhere with their writing, who wants to enjoy the process, who wants to feel that passion as they sit down to work on their latest project, this is a gorgeous book. So if you are in any way less than perfectly satisfied with your writing life, give this a read. It probably has something of value to offer you. And even if you are perfectly happy with your writing, you might read it anyway. It's a beautifully-written book that's a joy to read.s to get somewhere with their writing, who wants to enjoy the process, who wants to feel that passion as they sit down to work on their latest project, this is a gorgeous book.

It starts off with a fair amount of information that explains the intricate differences between the various kinds of cured meats of Italy. It even explains the various little regional differences, and interjects stories of specific families and villages in Italy that produce particular varieties of a product.<br /><br />There were only a few things about this book that didn't impress me, so I'll get them out of the way first. One or two of the recipes didn't seem to have entirely well-balanced flavors, but that can be a matter of taste. A soup that uses dried chickpeas states that you can substitute with canned, but doesn't say how much you should use if you want to do that. Some recipes state amounts by weight and others by number of slices, which can make purchasing a little more difficult if you're purchasing for multiple recipes at once (\\"hmm... I need 5 ounces plus 8 slices of prosciutto\\"). We did try one recipe where we were pretty well convinced that the author wrote ounces but must have meant slices. These are small details, which is why I only docked a point for them, but they are details that make a cookbook more difficult to use.<br /><br />That said, there is some wonderful material in this cookbook! In addition to all of the fascinating information, some of these recipes are just incredible. The aforementioned peas with prosciutto are quite good. There's a ciabatta sandwich with salame, artichokes and rosemary that's just out of this world. The same with a soup made with chickpeas, pasta and rosemary--neither chickpeas nor rosemary inherently delight me, but I just love that soup. The combination of flavors is absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />Not every recipe comes with a photo, but many of them do, and the photos are quite lovely--they'll certainly make you hungry! Most of the recipes are fairly simple, meant to showcase the delicious flavors of these products rather than cover them up. Only a few require any real time or effort, and that's comparatively speaking.<br /><br />In all I'm quite pleased with this cookbook. It contains some imperfections, but it's quite usable and produces delicious treats that make the most of Italy's delightful cured meats.flavors of these products rather than cover them up.

If you're looking for something particularly meaty this might not be your best choice, but if you want something non-threatening that won't make you feel weighed down at the thought of reading it, it could be perfect.<br /><br />The book includes a wide variety of exercises and tools of all types to help you better access your creativity. Some are more generally designed to increase your creativity or help you see the world in new ways; others are specifically aimed at helping you to tackle projects or problems.<br /><br />The book is a bit on the silly side. This kind of creativity book is perfect for some people because it helps them to loosen up emotionally, which in turn helps them to loosen up creatively. It puts other people off, however. So again, whether this is a pro or a con highly depends on you.<br /><br />On the other hand, it also has something of the feel of a corporate training program. This is a little harder to explain, but I'll do my best. I think it's because of the acronyms and structured tools and exercises oriented toward teams of co-workers. This gives the book a feeling not unlike being at a work-sponsored seminar, which feels a bit odd to me. But again, this will work fine for some people and not for others.<br /><br />Whether you'd find this particular creativity book useful and helpful is, I think, highly dependent on your personality. Some people will find the corporate seminar-like structure to be a turn-off; others will roll their eyes at the silliness. However, if those don't bother you, I think there's plenty here that will be of value to you. The exercises are handy and fun. The childlike attitude should encourage a loosening of the thought processes. The tools are simple, clear, useful, and well-defined. The quotes are well-chosen, and the tone is encouraging and helpful.those don't bother you, I think there's plenty here that will be of value to you. The exercises are handy and fun.

In fact, the basic flavors tended to be quite good. It's just that there are a number of details missing from the recipes, not to mention ratios that just seemed off somehow, and similar things. It also seemed that many of these dishes were a little low-volume; when I think potluck supper, I tend to think of larger amounts of food. One scalloped tomato dish we made provided four not-oversized servings.<br /><br />One of my pet peeves in a cookbook is inconsistency in the level of detail and type of notation. For example, if you have a cookbook where some herbs are mentioned as being dried and ground and others aren't (but also aren't specified as fresh), you can never be entirely sure whether those herbs are meant to be used fresh or dried--and there'll be a big difference in the result. This cookbook contains a number of such inconsistencies. For example, a corn casserole calls for a 15 oz. can of cream-style corn, but a \\"small\\" can of regular corn. In my experience 15 oz. cans are the smallest I've seen, but since the recipe used different notation does that mean it's supposed to be a smaller size? Any inconsistency in notation may imply a difference in usage--once those differences creep in, you can never be entirely sure what a recipe is calling for.<br /><br />We tried a turkey dressing from this book that had a wonderful flavor to it. However, the consensus among all of the people who tried it was that the recipe should have used at least half again as much bread and possibly twice as much (both the consistency and the intensity of the flavors were off). The \\"crispee bars deluxe\\" (a bar cookie recipe) were delicious, but two people found them too sweet and said they had too much chocolate, and I was right on the border--and I have a pretty high tolerance for sweet stuff.<br /><br />Other than the inconsistencies that confuse things, these are simple, easy recipes. I found them easy to make by myself even when I was also busy with other things, and they didn't take up much time. They're simple enough that they tend to come two or three to a page. Layout is clear and simple--there isn't much to mess up in that area when you're using such short and simple recipes!<br /><br />There are no photos to go with the recipes, but when you're talking about things like casseroles and bar cookies, this isn't a big deal.<br /><br />One of the more useful aspects of this book is the information on organizing such things as bake sales, potluck suppers, and church picnics. Most of it is simple, fairly obvious stuff (things like having serving spoons for each dish), but then again these are the details that it's easy to forget in the heat of things, particularly if you're new to this kind of work, so I'm glad they were included. I think someone who's already spent time organizing these kinds of things won't find much new, but someone who hasn't done it before will be glad of the help.<br /><br />All in all I like the quality of the food in this book, but I find the recipes a bit frustrating. If you feel comfortable enough in the kitchen that you think you'll be able to figure out some of the confusions and you don't mind mucking with the recipes then I'd say you should go ahead and use this cookbook, particularly if you'd find the informational material handy. However, I'd recommend making any recipe from this book for your own use before you make it for a public gathering, so you have the opportunity to fix any flavor imbalances or ingredient confusions.e) were delicious, but two people found them too sweet and said they had too much chocolate, and I was right on the border--and I have a pretty high tolerance for sweet stuff. <br /> <br />Other than the inconsistencies that confuse things, these are simple, easy recipes.

I think it might be more useful to explore stress, anger, and the negative emotions and then move on to ways to increase happiness. They're still both valuable books to read, however, in whatever order.<br /><br />This book is more widely applicable than it sounds, and covers stress management, assertiveness, relaxation techniques, burnout, communication techniques, and so on. It has a very thorough discussion of ways to effectively communicate with others, and some interesting background on anger, personal responsibility issues, violence, and conflict.<br /><br />If you have troubles in any of these areas, whether at work, at home, or in your social life, you might find this book helpful. It discusses nature vs. nurture arguments and causative events to help give you a handle on your feelings and where they come from. Then it goes into plenty of practical techniques to help you take stock of and control those feelings and their expression.<br /><br />Sometimes the author throws out a statement about one thing or another with nothing to back it up, and in a couple of cases this caught me short thinking, \\"why is she making that assertion? I'd like a little more information here.\\"<br /><br />There are a few errors here and there, such as an exercise in which the verbal instructions say to rate items from 1 to 5, but the table of correspondences lists 0 to 4. Since you're supposed to total up your score and compare it to a benchmark this actually does affect the outcome of the exercise. Along those lines, I'm not sure I agree with the benchmarks on some of the exercises. For instance, there's an exercise for measuring your stress level due to various stressors. We're told that if our total score is over 100, we'll \\"benefit from learning some of the stress management techniques.\\" To reach a score of 100, though, you'd have to accumulate stressors equivalent to 10 spouses dying (you get 10 points if your spouse dies). Call me oversensitive, but I think most people would be in need of stress management techniques long before reaching 100!<br /><br />All in all I think this is a very worthwhile book for anyone who suffers from stress, frustration, or anger and conflict management issues. It isn't perfect, but it's well-reasoned and helpful and provides a great many insights and coping strategies.a score of 100, though, you'd have to accumulate stressors equivalent to 10 spouses dying (you get 10 points if your spouse dies).

I find the prospect of reviewing \\"The Dictionary of Disagreeable English: A Curmudgeon's Compendium of Excruciatingly Correct Grammar,\\" by Robert Hartwell Fiske, intimidating. However painful it would be to be the object of his scorn, however, it's undeniably entertaining to see him take others to task. The \\"Dictionary\\" starts off with a lovely rant about \\"The Decline of the Dictionary,\\" in which Mr. Fiske bemoans the fact that so many dictionaries attempt to describe current usage, incorporating incorrect grammar and spelling, rather than setting down proper usage. He rips into Merriam-Webster with a long list of examples of \\"inexcusably shoddy dictionary making,\\" including the addition of \\"tho\\" as a variant spelling of \\"though\\" and the pronouncement that \\"flaunt\\" means the same as \\"flout\\" or \\"infer\\" means the same as \\"imply.\\"<br /><br />Most of the book consists of a dictionary of misused, misspelled, and mispronounced words. Some of them surprised me; I was a little shocked to find out that, for example, people often misuse \\"accelerate\\" in place of \\"exhilarate.\\" Other entries made me cringe when I realized I'd been misusing them myself; I can't remember any examples at the moment--I suspect I've blocked them out so as to spare myself the embarrassment of having to recount them in this review.<br /><br />It would be enough to have this wonderfully useful dictionary at hand. I certainly plan to keep my copy near to where I work, so I can hopefully reduce the amount of \\"disagreeable English\\" to be found in my own writing. The book is made all the more entertaining, however, through the use of boxed examples from real writers' and speakers' work, always presented with an entertaining cartoon of a frustrated or exasperated \\"grammar curmudgeon.\\" The book is very recent--it was published in 2005--and it uses up-to-date examples that will appeal to the modern reader.<br /><br />The only mild negative I can think of is that occasionally I wished for a little more clarification when two terms seemed very similar in meaning. The format typically consists of examples of the misusage, followed by an explanation of the differences between the words involved. Some of these entries would have benefited from further examples of the correct usage of the words in question.<br /><br />This book is just plain fun for grammar curmudgeons and invaluable for those with imperfect grammar.arification when two terms seemed very similar in meaning.

There are a number of recipes that I love in theory and usually only like in practice. These recipes involve ingredients and concepts that I find very appealing, but there's just something about the way the individual recipes get executed that leaves something to be desired. Stuffed mushrooms fall into this category. Recipes like this make great test recipes when I'm evaluating a cookbook because usually their quality is highly dependent on a careful balance of flavors, good technique, and adequate kitchen-testing. So, naturally, one of the recipes we made from this cookbook was the stuffed mushroom recipe. It turned out to be the best stuffed mushroom recipe I've ever had--everything that I've always felt stuffed mushrooms ought to be but rarely were. They were buttery, slightly crispy, flavorful, easy-to-make, and absolutely delightful.<br /><br />My only reservation, and it's a tiny one, is that the cookbook sometimes sticks with older, stodgier techniques when newer, faster ones do the job just as well. I'm sure it would stick in many chefs' throats to suggest that you could spray the mushrooms with olive oil cooking spray instead of painstakingly brushing them with olive oil using a pastry brush, but I did half of the mushrooms one way and half the other and honestly couldn't tell which mushrooms were which--there were no identifiable differences in the finished product.<br /><br />The full-color photographs that go with the recipes are simple, elegant and lovely. The layout is easy to understand, with the different elements of the recipes set off visually from one another and the instructions broken into bite-sized chunks. The recipes are surprisingly uncomplicated, although as mentioned in some places they could be even simpler; certainly for elegant holiday fare this is easy cooking.<br /><br />The point is, no matter what I pulled from this cookbook--new, old, doubtful, sure thing--it rose to the occasion. Every single recipe delighted us. Each one left us sighing with happiness. So whether you want to make crab bisque this Christmas (or Thanksgiving, or Easter, or New Year's, or other holiday of your choice), butternut squash and apple soup, rack of lamb with cranberry-chile relish, brisket braised in red wine, wild rice pilaf with dried cranberries and pecans, chocolate mousse cake, chicken hash, panettone French toast, gougeres, eggnog, or even chocolate truffles, I highly recommend picking up a copy of this cookbook. It's definitely worthy of any special occasion you might wish to celebrate.ft us sighing with happiness.

This is a sturdy cookbook, a relatively slim hardcover with an attractive, simple layout that makes it easy to decipher the recipes.<br /><br />The cover says \\"Christ is our CEO\\" and there are bible quotes sprinkled liberally throughout the book. I'm only uncomfortable with this sort of thing if I feel there's been a bait-and-switch: i.e., I open a product that looks perfectly non-religious and find that I'm being preached at. That isn't the case here. The writers of this cookbook are perfectly open and honest about their religious leanings--right down to that aforementioned note on the cover--and there isn't an air of attempting to preach to the non-believer, which I appreciate.<br /><br />My one complaint about the cookbook is easily explained by the fact that it was created for a company's products and presumably not written by an experienced cookbook author. It misses some small nuances that tend to have a disproportionately large impact on the usability of a cookbook.<br /><br />For example, a recipe for chip dip doesn't list chips in the ingredients list. A recipe for cheese balls (meant to be spread on crackers) doesn't include the crackers in the list of ingredients. Hamburgers don't mention buns or any optional fixings in the ingredient lists. I know this seems unnecessary to people who are unfamiliar with cookbook-writing; it's obvious that you need these things, right? But when someone makes out their grocery list they often copy things down from the list, and if they're in any kind of a hurry they might miss something that isn't written down. You don't want to get most of the way through cooking your hamburgers only to discover that you've forgotten to buy the fixings.<br /><br />I have to admit, these are good recipes. I think my favorite was a recipe involving chicken breast and lemonade concentrate. Chicken isn't my favorite ingredient, but I ate that dish until I hurt. (Ohhh... memory pains....) However, I did sometimes feel that as much as I enjoyed the recipes, the balance of ingredients was just slightly off. The cheese balls were quite good, but it was hard to actually taste much of the sauce in them; a little more would have been nice. The pumpkin delight (no, the desserts do not use the sauces!) was quite delicious, but overly sweet (and I do not say that about many things).<br /><br />If I were to take this simply as a cookbook and compare it to all the other cookbooks I've ever used, I'd give it a three out of five because of those missed nuances that make things harder on the cook. However, for a cookbook meant to showcase a product I'd give it four out of five, because frankly for that kind of cookbook this isn't an unusual issue, and these recipes make delicious use of a wonderful product. I'll compromise and call my rating 3.5.but I ate that dish until I hurt. (Ohhh... memory pains....)

All of these sections support one goal: helping people to write with precision and clarity. The examples aren't taken from the Great American Novel or from philosophical treatises; they're taken from resumes, college entrance essays, business memos, and so on.They're meant to help you get through everyday writing needs. They're meant to help you present yourself well in the real world of school and jobs.<br /><br />Whether you need to learn about the top-down approach or transition words, you'll find handy suggestions in the \\"Structure\\" section. Perhaps most interesting and useful is the section on the six basic writing structures, including charts and examples. Two things you'll find in every section are examples and exercises; the examples serve well to straighten out any confusion, and the exercises (to which you'll find the answers in one of the appendices) make the lessons stick with you.<br /><br />Whether you need to learn to support what you say, personalize examples, use parallel forms, or choose an appropriate tone, you can get a handle on it in the \\"Style\\" chapter. The \\"Readability\\" section deals with interesting topics such as layout, design, headings, gender, and revision; many of the techniques in this chapter are employed to great effect in this book.<br /><br />In addition to the 20 rules of writing, this book includes 30 rules of grammar. This chapter serves as excellent reference material for someone who occasionally has trouble keeping \\"further\\" and \\"farther\\" straight or knowing when to use reflexive pronouns.<br /><br />This is a remarkably stylish little book. It has a very \\"old world\\" feel to it, which is rather nifty considering this came out in 2004. It's a small book with cream-colored pages decorated with old-style borders and images; a formal tone supports its traditional feel. However, the drawback is that it's dry reading.<br /><br />Also, as befits the tone but not the time period, there is no reference to how any of this relates to things such as writing for new media. In most cases it doesn't matter; elements of structure, for example, don't really change when you write for the web. Elements of readability, however, could have benefited from a discussion of how they relate to web pages or magazine articles as opposed to essays or job applications.<br /><br />For a truly in-depth work to help you get the most out of your writing, I prefer Wilbers' \\"Keys to Great Writing.\\" For a simpler reference work that's easier to access at a moment's notice, however, Royal's \\"Little Red Writing Book\\" makes a great alternative.

There's information on typical tasks associated with tech writer jobs, attributes common to good tech writers, breaking into the field (samples, writing tests, portfolios, degrees, recruiters, interview tips, networking), and the characteristics of a good technical document. The book goes into usability issues, completeness, consistency, and more. It guides you through five steps to creating a technical document, and introduces you to the idea that a lot of your time won't be spent writing at all--it'll be spent talking to people, using the products you're writing about, collecting information, revising, and so on.<br /><br />This book puts a great emphasis on communicating with others--much more so than I was expecting. The authors point out that it's often the tech writer who ends up acting as a go-between for the engineers and other departments. It's the tech writer who has to get information out of everyone about deadlines, program features, and more. It's the tech writer who has to know how to gracefully encourage and handle feedback on her drafts and shepherd people into giving her that feedback on schedule. The tech writer's job can require a surprising amount of tact and people skill.<br /><br />This book includes information on elements of English language usage that will make your documents clearer and easier to understand. A user's manual must convey different information in different ways than, say, an academic treatise, a novel, or a pamphlet does. You'll find information on indexing, active vs. passive voice, punctuation, humor, paragraph length, tense, person, figures and tables, and \\"simplified English.\\" Much of the information here would be helpful to nonfiction writers of all kinds, not just tech writers.<br /><br />My only negatives regarding this book stem from a semi-blind optimism on the part of the authors; they seem to think the positive state of things like the market for tech writers will last for the foreseeable future. I think a few too many of their assumptions were overly hopeful, and because of this an unwary reader could get a skewed perspective of the job. However, I think the advice in areas such as document design, discipline, job skills, people-management and so on more than makes up for these flaws. This is a valuable resource for someone interested in entering the field as a technical writer.

Yoakam, R.D., M.S.), almost measures up to its predecessor (\\"1,001 Low-Fat Recipes,\\" by the same authors), but not quite.<br /><br />Nutrition information (approximate, of course) is helpfully provided with every recipe. It includes calories, fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, protein, carbohydrates--but unfortunately for Weight Watchers POINTS folks, no fiber.<br /><br />I find that the authors seem to have a good sense for how to blend flavors well, and also have a good sense for when you should allow flavors to blend before eating and for how long (the book says to refrigerate the chutney cheese spread for an hour or two before eating, and you really should--it tastes incredible after it's been in the fridge for a while!). The authors do a wonderful job of helping you tailor recipes to your own tastes. They often pick a few ingredients and give a measurement range for them instead of a strict measurement or directions to use \\"to taste.\\" I love this because it provides some guidelines to give you an idea of what would taste good, but lets you use more or less as suits you individually.<br /><br />Some of the recipe textures aren't quite as appealing. It seems like no matter what you do to it, fat-free cream cheese just doesn't come out smooth and creamy. I tried two recipes from this book that used it and both looked and felt slightly off, even if they did taste wonderful. I wish the use of fat-free ingredients had been slightly more sparing.<br /><br />Most of the recipes are incredibly simple. This is a very straightforward book--more than 800 pages of quick-and-easy recipes. No photos. No fancy glossy paper. No three-page complicated directions. Layout is equally uncomplicated, with straight lists of ingredients and short, numbered instructions. Most recipes only consist of a few steps once you get a bit of chopping or shredding out of the way.<br /><br />Whether you want to make Vegetable Moussaka, Veal Lady Sharon, Sweet Potato and Tempeh Patties, or plain old Chicken and Noodles, you'll find it here. This is not a vegetarian cookbook; however there's definitely a focus on fruits, legumes and vegetables. There's also more than enough vegetarian fare, I believe, to satisfy a vegetarian, including an entire chapter of vegetarian (not vegan) entrees.<br /><br />While I don't think this follow-on is quite as stunning as its predecessor, it's solidly good and well worth getting if you want a source of simple, healthy, delicious recipes.table Moussaka, Veal Lady Sharon, Sweet Potato and Tempeh Patties, or plain old Chicken and Noodles, you'll find it here.

In such a book you might expect to find the typical information on writers' guidelines, stamped self-addressed envelopes, query letters, and making sure you spell editors' names correctly--and you will find that here. However, you'll also find quite a few other, less expected things.<br /><br />The authors do not assume familiarity with the industry. They walk you through the rewards of being a freelance writer, explain why magazines hire freelancers and what freelancers do for magazines, share some success stories from real freelancers, share information from editors on what they look for in a writer, and provide a \\"reality check\\" to help you decide if this is what you really want to do. This book is particularly good about pointing out all of the mistaken attitudes, inadvertent errors and inappropriate assumptions that can mess up your chances. And it does it without either coddling you or harshing on you.<br /><br />This book came out in 2000, but it does a good job of covering the basics of online publication--better than I've seen in many other places, actually. It doesn't just cover online versions of print magazines or a brief discussion of electronic rights. Instead it goes in-depth into 'zines, content providers, building your own web site in order to attract editors to you, and so on. It also goes into the business side of writing: business filing, taxes and contracts. It discusses how you can choose and create a specialty for yourself, and how you can decide whether or not you should develop an article into a book proposal!<br /><br />This is a fantastic book. It contains only a handful of typos of the wouldn't-be-caught-by-a-spell-checker variety (most people probably wouldn't even notice). The advice is helpful and encouraging yet practical and realistic. I've rarely seen an approach that so clearly manages to convey the things to watch out for when freelancing without becoming preachy, condescending or morose, and there's plenty of advice in here that I haven't seen repeated in a dozen other places.d realistic.

I can't even begin to give you an idea of the incredible variety present here. However, I can say that I drooled over the salad chapter. Really. I don't even like salads all that much, normally. But the dishes in this book are fresh, original, delicious, simple, and, for the most part, very flavorful. The recipes and their directions are incredibly simple. The only nitpick I have is that sometimes it seems like a tiny bit more detail would be nice, such as exactly how thick they mean by \\"thickened.\\" However, the recipes are simple enough conceptually that even with only a small amount of experience in the kitchen you should be able to figure them out.<br /><br />I really love most of the flavors in this cookbook. Let's take a bean salad as an example. As a general rule, I really don't like beans much. You have to do something truly nifty to them for me to like them, and I don't think I've ever enjoyed a bean salad before. Ever. And neither has my husband. But the dressing looked so good (apricot preserves, ginger, vinegar, etc.) that I couldn't resist trying it, and we both loved it so much we practically couldn't stop eating it! The only thing we made that was bland was the mushroom rolls--there wasn't much in the way of flavoring agents, but all it took was a bit of spice mix to fix that. And I expect a friend of ours who enjoys bland food would have thought the recipe was fine, so that's more a matter of taste than anything else. I'm very impressed by cookbooks that can take foods I normally don't like and turn them into foods that I love, and this is certainly one of them.<br /><br />Nutritional information is included with the recipes, including calories, fat grams, saturated fat grams, cholesterol, sodium, protein, carbohydrates, and exchanges. Unfortunately for people on the Weight Watchers POINTS system they don't include fiber. In the menus section they even include an assessment of the nutrition per serving for the entire menu as a whole!<br /><br />I've really enjoyed using this cookbook, and plan to make many more recipes out of it.

Dr. Seligman proposes a slightly different way of looking at this situation and represents it with the following equation:  H = S + C + V where H is your overall current happiness, S is your set range, C is the influence of current life events, and V represents those factors under your voluntary control. His idea is that while you can't really change your set range, you can set yourself up to experience the highest part of that range a much greater portion of the time.<br /><br />He believes you can do this by altering how you view your life (past, present and future), using psychological strategies to make your life more pleasant, and discovering and using to the fullest what he calls your \\"signature strengths.\\"<br /><br />The research in this book is quite methodical and solid. Seligman systematically lays out the details of dozens of studies (at least!) and decades of research by luminaries and students alike. This is a thick book. Not dry, thankfully, and not inaccessible, but definitely thick. It isn't something you can skim in two hours and be done with; it takes some time to read through, digest, and absorb. This is not a bad thing. Everything is explained with care and attention to detail.<br /><br />This is an immensely practical and helpful book. It doesn't just talk about happiness; it provides concrete strategies backed up by thorough research that can help you to improve your happiness and your satisfaction with your life. This truly is a how-to book on happiness. The research is solid, careful, and well-thought-out. Dr. Seligman, a self-avowed pessimist, makes it easy for non-optimists to see and understand his points; unlike many optimists he doesn't boil it down to a simple \\"cheer up!\\" but instead gives us critical evidence and practical strategies. This is a courageous, in-depth, thoughtful, and highly helpful book for just about anyone from a brilliant researcher.

Ms. Warshaw also provides concrete psychological strategies to help you resist large portions of fatty food.<br /><br />Unfortunately her presentation of information is somewhat inconsistent. For example, in the opening list of healthy foods to eat when out at the zoo or such, she lists pizza without any qualifiers, despite the fact that at many fast-food places pizza contains a wealth of grease and cheese. When she gets to the pizza chapter she includes the qualifiers that explain how you can choose pizza that will be healthy for you. She does this all over the place, though--including qualifiers in one place, then labeling the same thing as healthy or not elsewhere without mentioning those qualifiers. This is very confusing and leads to inconsistent indications about what it's okay to eat and what it isn't.<br /><br />She also over-relies on artificial sweeteners as a cure-all for calorific beverages, completely neglecting the fact that some people  can very distinctly taste a particularly unpleasant and even nauseating bitter/sickly-sweet aftertaste with these sweeteners, and that some people still have concerns over their potential health impacts. For some of us artificial sweeteners simply aren't an option, and a wider discussion of possibilities would have been nice.<br /><br />There's a great deal of value in here for the restaurant-goer, but make sure to read entire chapters rather than simply referring to one chart or list at a time. Otherwise you're likely to miss important information.the fact that some people  can very distinctly taste a particularly unpleasant and even nauseating bitter/sickly-sweet aftertaste with these sweeteners, and that some people still have concerns over their potential health impacts.

He uses these criteria as a guide to show you how you can spot the flaws in your own work and then go on to solve them.<br /><br />The great thing is that this isn't just a guide to fixing surface flaws and using gimmicks to try to \\"sneak\\" your work past editors, which is what it sort of sounded like when I first heard of the book. Instead it uses those simple criteria as a way of organizing major, real issues. It delves into the idea that there's a very good reason why editors can dismiss most manuscripts out of hand--these criteria are used to note real problems that plague manuscripts and make them not worth the editor's time. Because of this, by going through the criteria and showing you how to apply these criteria in judging and repairing your own work, Lukeman is telling you how to make your manuscript better.<br /><br />Lukeman approaches things in the order that he, as an editor, tends to look at and dismiss them by, suggesting that you do the exercises from the end of each section and chapter on your manuscript before proceeding to the next part. This means that with each successive pass through your manuscript, it should (in theory) last just a little longer through an editor's evaluation.<br /><br />In each part Lukeman goes into a typical problem that will cause a manuscript to get quickly rejected by editors. He explains why it's a problem and how to fix it, gives examples, and then provides exercises to use on your own manuscript.<br /><br />I can't agree with all of his suggestions, and this book makes for somewhat dry reading, but it's a great checklist to apply to your manuscript.	2005-01-19

Books	5	22	24	N	N	Create a special occasion, just so you can use this cookbook	This cookbook covers a nifty range of special occasions--much better than that in any other cookbook I've seen! It includes traditional holidays, non-traditional holidays, and things that aren't holidays at all (the \\"congratulations on a new job\\" menu, the \\"Saturday night with friends\\" menu, the \\"Springtime bridal shower\\" menu, a menu for a big family reunion, a birthday bash, a housewarming, a cozy dinner for two, and more).<br /><br />Many of the dishes are traditional, or have been around for many years, but Ms. Lukins brings her own flair to them. She never gets too outrageous, but she's also never boring. I think she walks the perfect middle ground to ensure that this cookbook will appeal to as many people as possible, which is a tough thing to do!<br /><br />What's most impressive to me, however, is how uniformly delicious and painless these recipes are. Every single one we've made has come out absolutely perfectly, without a hitch or confusion. Every single one has been completely delicious. The haroseth was fantastic, with its subtle blend of honey and a little bit of spicing. The Irish soda bread rolls beautifully contrasted the tang of buttermilk with the sweetness of raisins. The barbecue sauce is, quite literally, the best I've had, and the sesame noodles have a surprisingly complex and delightful flavor--the kind where with every bite you taste something new. The raspberry sauce, which we made to go with a cheesecake from another cookbook, was heavenly.<br /><br />This is an outstanding cookbook, and I can't wait for an excuse to make more out of it. We're already planning which special occasion we'll take advantage of next!	2005-01-14

It's a book on how to write stories, with a bunch of story starters finishing off each chapter (and plenty of suggestions worked into the material). The topics covered range from developing your character to stock characters and archetypes, conflict, using current events to inspire your stories, naming your character, using animals as minor characters, and more. The author approaches some of the material from the point of view of how you can use it to inspire ideas for stories (which fits the theme of the book perfectly), but other bits seem like they're meant to be part of a more generic book.<br /><br />In some places, particularly the chapters that seemed more generic, the writing babbled and wandered a bit. There seemed to be a distinct lack of context for some things. The author threw out references all over the place without explanation, and although they referred to well-known works, not all of her readers will have read every one of those works (or remember the details necessary to make heads or tails of what she's trying to say).<br /><br /> Sometimes this book made perfect sense to me and was a joy to read; at others I felt lost and confused. Occasionally I felt like I was reading one book that had bits of another book woven into it, or a book that the author had just kind of plopped down onto paper in a semi-stream-of-consciousness manner, without going back to make sure everything fit in its place.<br /><br />For the most part I really like the story starters themselves. Ms. Stanek provides a goodly number of them at the end of each chapter, and I'm sure that somewhere in there you could find something to inspire you. She also includes plenty of throw-away ideas within the text itself. Some of the starters are wild and crazy, which nicely fits into the idea of loose associations and flights of creativity. Others are more normal. Some seem rather hackneyed, however.<br /><br />All in all I think this book serves as a good source of prompts. The story-writing material is a little less amazing, but since that isn't the focus of the book I see it as being less important. If you're buying the book just for the story starters and can buy it at an appropriate price for that, consider my rating to be a 4; otherwise, on the whole I'd give it a 3.book serves as a good source of prompts.

Dr. Stock specifically says that he doesn't want to push an agenda--he merely wants to spur people to think more carefully about what it is they're doing and why.<br /><br />The questions run the gamut from economic programs to health care, international policy to business. There are questions about hiring and firing employees, stealing from or betraying employers, tradeoffs in public programs and government spending, and so on. Many of the questions seem particularly relevant to today's political situations.  While I wasn't as fond of the tradeoff questions in the \\"Love and Sex\\" book, I think that in this one they come across much better. Somehow they end up feeling less arbitrary and more like realistic quandaries.<br /><br />Dr. Stock tries not to give us easy questions with easy answers, instead forcing us to truly think about the hard issues.	2005-01-10

They are, in general, a bit deeper and more thought-provoking than those in the original \\"Book of Questions;\\" they're also definitely of an adult nature. I think this book is best for self-exploration purposes, in which you answer some of the questions for yourself and learn a few things you might not have known before. It can also be good for learning more about your relationship. If you're willing to talk about these with your lover or spouse they can bring about greater openness, but I do have one reservation here. Some of these are going to be tough questions on difficult topics (fidelity, in thought and deed, comes up quite often, for example) and could conceivably lead to arguments rather than closeness under the wrong circumstances.<br /><br />Like \\"The Book of Questions\\" this is a small book, capable of fitting in a reasonably large pocket. It includes 243 questions, plus follow-ups to a handful of them. The questions in this book seem more predictable, but then they do cover one narrow range of topics.<br /><br />You could still use this book as a conversation-starter, like the last one, but only with people you feel comfortable talking about such intimate issues with. You can still use it as inspiration for writing purposes, but mostly just in cases where your characters have relationship issues to explore and you want to get a better handle on them.<br /><br />The book is very simple--pretty much just the questions, one or two to a small page, with white space surrounding them--Dr. Stock wanted to make sure he didn't give the impression of any kind of \\"correct\\" answer, so there's no discussion in the book at all. He wanted the discussion provoked by the questions to reflect entirely the beliefs and thoughts of the people having the discussion, and I think that's a great way to approach things.	2005-01-07

In \\"Empowering Teens to Build Self-Esteem,\\" Suzanne E. Harrill (a licensed therapist and counselor as well as teacher and writer) gets her message across in simple, easy terms that aren't condescending and don't talk down to her audience.<br /><br />The book addresses the basics of self-esteem such as how to recognize low self-esteem, why people have self-esteem problems, what constitutes having good self-esteem, and the principles we need to learn in order to have good self-esteem. It sticks to straightforward concepts with clear explanation.<br /><br /> I think the book does a good job of addressing its intended teen audience. Surprisingly there's actually a fair amount adults can get out of this book, however. Its simple approach can benefit almost anyone, and adults could even benefit from many of the same general relationship tips.<br /><br /> The book does an incredibly good job of balancing two very important issues that often get skewed out of alignment in one direction or the other: the idea that yes, many self-esteem problems have their origin in childhood events and family environments, but that today, now, is the individual's responsibility. While it's often important to understand where these problems come from (for example, if you can recognize that you've unconsciously picked up the behaviors of a parent you may be able to more easily see those behaviors in yourself and alter them), it's just as important to recognize that you're ultimately the person who can help you and make your life better.<br /><br /> The book is written so a teen can read and understand it herself, but it's also written with teachers and counselors in mind; it includes simple evaluations as well as journaling questions. It's clear, straightforward, and well-balanced--if you're looking for some help with self-esteem issues but find the larger or more technical books out there too intimidating, this could be a great solution.midating, this could be a great solution.	2004-12-08

I love the idea of being able to dump some ingredients in, leave it all day, and come back to a tender, delicious meal. But somehow it almost never seems to work out that way.<br /><br />We've tried all sorts of slow cooker recipes over the years; almost every one comes out tasting very bland. Or the flavors get jammed together and you lose the subtlety and richness you'd get out of a \\"normal\\" recipe. Or the recipe author solved the lack of flavor by finding a strong ingredient or two and pouring them on, producing a dish with a very unbalanced taste. Finally we stumbled across \\"The Everything Slow Cooker Cookbook,\\" and we found recipes we actually liked.<br /><br />The book provides an unusual variety of recipes, for a slow cooker cookbook at least. There isn't as much as a regular cookbook, but then most slow cooker recipes out there are variations on stew or pot roast, so I'll take what I can get. There's a serious limit on what you can do with this kind of cooking appliance so you can't really expect the variety of a generic cookbook.<br /><br />The author provides information on how slow cookers affect the flavors of things like spices and aromatic vegetables (this makes it much easier to adjust recipes to your taste). She also gives information on converting regular recipes to the slow cooker. These pieces of information alone make this book valuable.<br /><br />She also has a good sense of flavor, in my opinion. I've always thought I *should* like baked beans, based on the ingredients, but I couldn't find a version that appealed to me. I've made the two versions from this cookbook and they were both delightful! We've made other things as well, including soups and a rice pudding, and all of them came out quite well. My only issue with them is that some of them didn't store well at all, which can be a pain when you're making an entire crock-pot's worth of food. Also, the author sometimes drastically underestimates the number of servings, I think (but better that than over-estimating...).<br /><br />For the life of me I can't figure out why the author converted things like cookie recipes to the slow cooker, but oh well. These recipes don't take up that much space. Other than the storage issues we've really enjoyed this cookbook. The flavors are very good, the recipes are straightforward, the information is comprehensive, and the variety and number of recipes is extensive. If you want the convenience of a slow cooker but don't like typical slow cooker recipes, this is a very good cookbook to try.the number of servings, I think (but better that than over-estimating...). <br /> <br />For the life of me I can't figure out why the author converted things like cookie recipes to the slow cooker, but oh well.

While the quality of Haedrich's recipes isn't consistent, it doesn't really matter; he keeps coming up with fantastic, sometimes unusual ideas, many of which do turn out to be stunning, and that's enough to forgive a few flops.<br /><br />I have to give you both a recommendation and a warning. This book contains a recipe for Banana-Stuffed French Toast with Banana Cream. It was so good that we couldn't stop eating it until we were well past the point where common sense told us to stop, and we spent the rest of the morning holding our stomachs and saying, \\"ow... that was so good... ow... do we have any more? ow...\\"<br /><br />Recipes include some very good pancakes and waffles, cereals and grains, a variety of egg recipes, vegetable recipes, meat recipes, sandwiches, quick breads, elegant fare, fruits, jellies and such, and beverages--in other words, a dazzling array of breakfast foods. The Blueberry Cream Cake is to-die-for; we've made it again and again.<br /><br />The recipes are fairly simple; even the elegant stuff doesn't take much time and effort. The layout is clear and easy to read. Most of the ingredients are ordinary, everyday items available at any grocery store, with a few exceptions.<br /><br />We haven't adored everything in this cookbook. Some of the whole grain recipes are a little much for us, and some things are just kind of there as far as quality goes. But the stuff that's good--and that's the majority of it--is very good.<br /><br />All in all, this book is definitely a worthwhile purchase for any breakfast-lover.	2004-10-07

He has a fascination with \\"weird fiction,\\" with the unknowable, the macabre. This is paired with a knack for eloquent word-poetry, intelligence and complexity, and a sense of the chillingly unusual. When I finish reading several Ligotti stories, I find that the world looks different. The colors aren't quite right any more, or the angles, or maybe people seem a little darker, a little stranger.<br /><br />I have several books of Ligotti stories and Noctuary is my favorite. I have often wondered why, and the answer I eventually came to is that most of the stories in here are shorter than those in other books. The longest one is less than 40 pages, and many are only two or three pages long. As much as I love all of Ligotti's writing, he's at his best when he writes in short chunks. Otherwise I find his writing sometimes drags a little.<br /><br />Ligotti's work is not for everyone. If you don't like the weird or the macabre, you won't enjoy his work. If you prefer your stories to be normal, with a beginning, middle and end, all wrapped up in a neat little ribbon, then this is not for you. If you prefer your world to be its same, comfortable self when you close your books - don't read a word of Ligotti. Ligotti's style is definitely not for everyone. He hands us phrases that no one but he would conceive of, that almost cannot help but elicit a shudder:<br /><br /> \\"We witness the scene and, with what remains of our mouths, we smile.\\"<br /><br />But for those of us who enjoy it, it is a dread and harrowing pleasure - one that I would not give up. My only regret is that Ligotti is not a more prolific author.	2004-10-07

However, that should in no way discourage you from reading this book!<br /><br />Ligotti writes horror. Not horror with lots of blood and gore; not the stereotypical fare of serial killers, vampires, werewolves, and witches. Even when he does touch on \\"standard\\" topics, they come to life in unusual and fundamentally odd ways. Ligotti writes a sort of text-poetry, a magic of words and images, shadows and light, madness and clarity, puppets and people. Ligotti's work mystifies and terrifies. He doesn't spell everything out. He leaves questions unanswered and oddities unexplained. But he does it well--I never feel as though I've been left missing anything.<br /><br />Some of the pieces in this book are not entirely fiction. You'll find essays on the art of writing horror, but they'll send no less of a shiver down your spine than the stories themselves. There's even one piece that's an essay on writing horror and a story, both in one (\\"Notes on the Writing of Horror: A Story\\"). In this piece we follow the character of Nathan and the various versions of his life as might befit a horror story.<br /><br /> \\"By means of supernatural horror we may evade, momentarily, the horrific reprisals of affirmation.\\"<br /><br />Sometimes it can be difficult to tell what is essay and what is story, as Ligotti blurs the line beyond recognition. Ligotti speaks in analogy and metaphor, image and verse. Some may find this book slow, or too wordy. Ligotti is certainly not for everyone. But if you enjoy unusual, thrilling, subtle, lyrical, dark stories, then please give him a try. His is a voice worth hearing.<br /><br /> \\"And in darkness we open our eyes, briefly, and in darkness we close them.\\"	2004-10-07

One of my favorite flavors combined with one of my favorite cookbook publishers--how could I go wrong? As usual, Chronicle did not disappoint; cookbook author Peggy Cullen and food photographer Maren Caruso have served up one of the most decadent cookbooks since Marcel Desaulniers' Death by Chocolate series.<br /><br />Caramelizing sugar can be tough. It can burn in seconds. It can seize up. However, I saw an episode of Alton Brown's TV show \\"Good Eats\\" that dealt with the subject. Alton and food scientist Shirley O. Corriher explained lots of science about sugar crystals, the upshot of which is: include a little light corn syrup and your caramel won't seize up. That simple. I checked right away, and the caramel recipe here calls for a few drops of lemon juice or a little light corn syrup; I was satisfied that the author knew her stuff.<br /><br />I headed for recipes that looked like challenges--ones I was a bit dubious about. I inherently love caramel, so this cookbook has an unfair advantage when being judged. The nut brittle (I'm not overly fond of nuts nor the sickly-sweetness of most brittles) bowled me over; I couldn't stop eating it. The pears poached in port wine sauce (I'm not thrilled about the taste of alcohol either) were delicious.<br /><br />Recipes range from the elegant (fresh figs with caramel and creme fraiche) to the simple (caramel popcorn), time-consuming (chocolate-caramel crunch cake) to quick (caramel dessert sauce). There are classics like creme caramel, creme brulee, buttercrunch toffee, and nut praline. There are also plenty of things I haven't seen in other cookbooks, like caramelized banana split-second sundae, caramel-roasted strawberry shortcakes, and chocolate souffle roulade with caramel whipped cream. (And oh, the caramel peach-bottom babycakes are wonderful!)<br /><br />I can't think of a single negative thing to say about this cookbook. Cooks who aren't confident in the kitchen and prefer to keep things simple would find many of the recipes too complex, but even they could play with things like the nut brittle, caramel sauce and caramel popcorn. Some people might not be thrilled by the price-to-number of recipes ratio (roughly 50 recipes not including variations and decorations), but this book has a value that the flat number of recipes can't convey.<br /><br />Cullen demystifies caramel and turns it into something doable--even easy for more experienced cooks. And that's pure, luxurious, delectable magic.cookbook.

However, I found the \\"Air Force Officer's Guide\\" fascinating. The book starts right off with issues of conduct, leadership, and responsibility, beautifully setting the tone for the rest of the material. This is almost certainly idealized to a certain extent, but that's rather the point, I think--this is meant as a guide of behavior to be aspired to.<br /><br />There's information in here about professional development, training, education, health, fitness, promotion, and the officer evaluation system. I think this material gives a clear picture of what the author believes officers can do to best serve their country as well as themselves. The book stresses that officers must be willing to take every opportunity to advance their education, through personal efforts as well as structured training, and it gives many suggestions for how to go about this.<br /><br />One of my favorite sections covers \\"The Air Force Way,\\" delving into AF cultures and traditions and explaining the differences between military courtesies and customs of the service. There's a nifty section explaining all the little details of uniforms and insignia and how to wear them properly, including diagrams and drawings. There's even a section on social life in the AF, and the book discusses the general issue of the AF as a career, and the rights, privileges, and restrictions that go with it. I think the book does get rather dry as it moves onward into issues of pay, leave time, medical benefits, retirement, and so on, but then it would be a miracle if it didn't.<br /><br />This is a handy multi-purpose book if you have any interest in the Air Force, whether or not you're actually a part of it. Its stated purpose is to help officers in their careers. I think it would be a great way for someone who's thinking of joining up to get a feel for whether or not it's their sort of thing. It's a good way for people to gain a new appreciation for the kind of work, dedication, and discipline it takes to be a part of the armed services. And it's fantastic reference material for a military buff, a writer doing research for a project, or even a roleplayer who wants to be able to get in the right mood (and design a realistic character) for a military-based roleplaying game.t's a good way for people to gain a new appreciation for the kind of work, dedication, and discipline it takes to be a part of the armed services.

The setting is one of my favorites (the \\"Stargate SG-1\\" TV show universe is dead-on perfect as an RPG setting). The system (adapted d20; you'll need the \\"Dungeons & Dragons Player's Handbook, third edition) is wonderful--in particular it's stunningly detailed, allows characters to try virtually anything, and is quite flexible. It's simple enough to understand without much work, but complex enough to allow for dramatic, varied game-play. The amount of information provided is fantastic.<br /><br />The one down-side of this much information is that we keep forgetting that there are rules we should be applying to the game because there are just so darn many of them. Over time this abates--you get better at remembering what's in the book the more you play. Run a few combats before you play the game, so you aren't trying to learn both at the same time.<br /><br />My real gripe, and the one that took away that coveted last star, is that the editing job is terrible, and the layout job with respect to the charts doesn't help. The editing problems are issues that noticeably interfere with game-play. Paragraphs trail off in the middle. Fractions have been replaced by letters (just how much can you blow up with 'G' lbs. of C4?). Charts are often found quite a few pages away from any explanatory text.<br /><br />There are the usual few details that feel a bit wrong--the idea that characters should gain roughly one level of experience for each mission would have had SG-1 retiring at the end of season 1 of the TV show. The idea that any officer player characters have Major as a minimum rank doesn't match up with either the TV show or the info in the first half of this book.<br /><br />However, these are minor issues and easily fixed. The company's web site ([...]) provides detailed errata in the forums, as well as additional resources. And other than these problems, this is still the most fun I've ever had either playing OR gamemastering an RPG.

It keeps the reader interested. And how do we create drama? By playing with conflict, action, and suspense. Noble's book covers the basic concepts of drama, confrontation, pulling on the reader's emotions, escalation, and immediacy. He also deals with elements that keep your story moving: appropriate grammar, charged images, shifts in point of view, and contrast. He does a good job of telling us the how and why of things, rather than simply telling us what to do.<br />He touches on suspense's relationship with all sorts of basic writing issues such as dialogue, openings, cliffhangers, mood and atmosphere, character development, point of view, pacing, endings, and so on. Noble does a good job of focusing on specific techniques relevant to suspense for the most part.<br />It isn't a perfect book. It isn't as dry as most textbooks, but it could certainly be better than it is. Some of the examples that Mr. Noble makes up to use in the book are a bit on the overblown side, which kind of undercuts some of his points. He might have been better off using more examples from published fiction. Also, some of Mr. Noble's assertions regarding his topics have since been proven to be wrong. For example, when talking about the logic of settings: &quot;...And a horror-suspense story would have problems if it was set in the unfolding of a miracle.&quot; I've seen this done quite well, actually.<br /><br />This book was originally copyrighted in 1994, and this may be part of the problem. Since then some of the techniques that he lauds as strong and effective have become over-used and trite. (Overused techniques became that way precisely because they're so effective.) Some of the things he says can't be done have been done. As it is, this book serves as a very good example of why you need to do a lot of reading in the fiction field you want to write in. Otherwise, how will you know which of his techniques have been over-used, which can be seen as trite if you aren't careful how you use them, and which are still seen as solid, useful methods?as trite if you aren't careful how you use them, and which are still seen as solid, useful methods?	2004-05-20

Given the sumptuousness of the desserts found in this cookbook, the photo of slim, trim author Marcel Desaulniers found on the back cover flap simply astounds. What's that old saying? Never trust a skinny chef? Well Marcel must have diabolical connections, because after trying this cookbook I trust him completely when it comes to the kitchen!<br />When I first bought this cookbook I was in a lamentable phase where chocolate just seemed to be \\"too much\\" if it wasn't tempered with other flavors. Despite that I found much to love in this cookbook: Sliced Blood Oranges with White Chocolate Sauce and Caramel Banana Chocolate Chip Ice Cream are fabulous. Fresh Berry Tulip with White Chocolate \\"Ice Cream\\" is spectacular, strewn with strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries. Chilled Orange Cappuccino Cream with Grated Chocolate could melt you straight into a puddle. No matter what your dessert fetish, you'll find something for it here.<br />Each recipe comes with a delectable photo that will leave you reeling with choices. Do we make the Dark Chocolate and Pumpkin Cheesecake this weekend? Or the Tipsy Chocolate Pecan Crunch Ice Cream? We'd make both if it weren't for the fact that these are *not* light dishes by any stretch of the imagination.<br />At first the recipes may look daunting. Don't let this worry you, though. While some of these recipes are indeed complex, many of them are simple. And most of the long pages of directions are a result of the author's wish to detail every step with precision so that you *don't* get too confused or overwhelmed. Few of the recipes call for unusual ingredients (the blood orange recipe is one of them), and any equipment from the lists that you don't have you can probably substitute for (although it really helps to have a stand mixer).<br />Besides, how can you possibly resist recipes with names like: Danielle's Temptation. Caramel Rum Delerium Ice Cream Cake. Chocolate Demise. Chocolate Devastation. Chocolate Phantasmagoria (yum!). Double Mocha Madness. And of course, Death by Chocolate.Double Mocha Madness. And of course, Death by Chocolate.	2004-05-20

Marcel Desaulniers is the most consistently amazing dessert cookbook author I've ever come across. Take, for example, Martha's Chocolate Freckles Fresh Blueberry Ice Cream Cake. It's based in a &quot;Chocolate Freckles Cake,&quot; which is a non-chocolate cake with finely-chopped or grated chocolate mixed into the batter. A homemade blueberry ice cream fills the space between the layers - this is honestly one of the best ice creams I've ever had, with a tart flavor created by the sour cream, cream cheese, and lemon juice. The topping is sweetened, vanilla-flavored whipped cream, and further fresh blueberries are ringed around the top.<br />Next we made Marcel's First Birthday Chocolate High and Fluffy-on-Top Cake. This is a chocolate cake with a vanilla frosting. It sounds so simple, but it's so delightful! This is truly the ultimate icing: sweet, not too buttery, and remarkably fluffy. I have never had such a fantastic icing before, and intend to use it on cake after cake in the future.<br />You'll find everything in here from Chocolate Rocky Road, to Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Ice Cream Cake, Chocolate Caraway On-the-Rocks Trifles, Chocolate-Dipped Orange Fry Cakes with Coffee and Cream, Uncle Sam's in the Black Cake (with a toasted oatmeal raising topping), Chocolate Tender Passion, and much more! Each recipe comes with a gorgeous picture. The recipes are inventive and of consistently excellent quality; the directions are thorough without being labyrinthine. They're several pages long for each recipe, but I never feel lost. Marcel repeats the amounts of the ingredients in the instructions so you don't have to flip back and forth to the ingredient amounts.<br />You'll probably not want to get this book unless you have a stand mixer--the key to many of these delights is loooong mixing times, sometimes of stiff batters. Other than that, however, Marcel tries to limit himself to common household equipment and time-scales. In short, if you like to cook and love chocolate cakes, buy this cookbook!olate cakes, buy this cookbook!	2004-05-20

Eventually I figured out that what he refers to as a &quot;story promise&quot; is something most writers would call a theme. To be fair, it's possible that Mr. Johnson would say &quot;no, that isn't it at all.&quot; But even if that wasn't what he meant, he could have cut and clarified his clunky 45-page explanation drastically by comparing and contrasting the two ideas rather than starting from scratch.<br />In addition to those 45 convoluted pages, Mr. Johnson has a wordy and often redundant style. However, there's also a lot of good stuff in this book. If you're having trouble making your stories dramatic and attention-grabbing, this book could seriously help you. Johnson's explanation of why the&quot;story promise&quot; is so important to drama makes a lot of sense to me. He believes that &quot;issues of human need&quot; are what pull an audience in and cause readers to invest emotion in a story. He goes into plenty of detail on the how as well as the why.<br />He uses examples from well-known movies and books; these help to prevent you from using his suggestions to accidentally create formulaic stories. I'm not saying that his system creates formulaic novels. However, there is a type of formula that could serve as an example of what he's trying to teach, and you could easily fall into it out of sheer familiarity without even realizing it. The examples help to prevent this because he likes non-formulaic examples. However, the book could really use a section about this trap, how to notice if you're falling into it, and how to avoid it.<br />This book teaches a valuable enough way of thinking about writing that I feel vaguely guilty pointing out its flaws. But the truth is that while Mr. Johnson's methods are fabulous, his expository writing can be convoluted and confusing. With some changes in the writing and some extra material on formulaic writing this could easily be a five-star book, but for me it's currently a three-star book. It's well worth your time and energy, but it may cause frustrations along the way.ulous, his expository writing can be convoluted and confusing.

This is a surprisingly versatile little book with a lot to say. It was written by psychotherapist, writer, and creative consultant Eric Maisel, author of two of my other favorite writing books--&quot;Living the Writer's Life&quot; and &quot;Deep Writing.&quot;<br />Maisel's affirmations are surprisingly practical. They don't always tell us that we're right; they don't encourage us to adopt a blind, everything-is-okay approach to life. But they do encourage us to move on despite our problems. Not everyone agrees with the precepts of cognitive therapy. One of its implications is that we don't need to understand or address where our &quot;bad thoughts&quot; come from--we just need to address those thoughts. There are plenty of people who believe that until we figure out and address the root cause of our traumas, we can't be free of them. Maisel takes a balanced approach to this. He admits that he doesn't know for sure whether such a cause-based approach is better for you. But he does point out that trying a cognitive approach (on its own or as an adjunct to other therapy) can't hurt, and certainly might help, so why not give it a try?<br /><br />Obviously not every affirmation will be right for you straight out of the box. The idea is that you learn how to create your own--ones that suit your particular issues and problems. The affirmations that Maisel provides will give you plenty of examples to start from, and he brings in a touch of humor here and there to lighten the mood. But perhaps this is best summed up by one of my favorite examples from the book:<br />Wrong Mind: &quot;Dan just published another book. I'm going to Amazon right  now and give it a terrible review.&quot;<br />Right Mind: &quot;Let me get back to my novel.&quot;	2004-05-19

It's filled with little &quot;prompts,&quot; and you use the blank page beneath each to free-write or take notes on things you can use in your writing. Normally I enjoy prompts and exercises, but this journal didn't thrill me.<br />Some of the prompts are engaging, but most just left me flat. Sure, some of this is going to be individual preference. However, I think I do have a few valid quibbles. For example, each prompt comes with the rest of one blank page of paper. Great in theory, but some of the prompts clearly seem to be exercises that will take up *much* more than one blank page of paper. Other prompts just don't seem to suggest anything further to write about at all.<br />The book is broken up into a handful of sections--Ideas, People and Characters, Conversation and Dialogue, Descriptions, Observations, Names and Titles, and Dreams and Anecdotes. The introduction suggests that, for example, if a person somewhere strikes you as interesting, you should flip to the &quot;People and Characters&quot; chapter and jot down your observations.  First, this makes the book sound more like a workbook or, well, a blank notebook that happens to have some quotes in it, than a journal. Second, none of the pages are numbered. So if you want to flip to a certain section, it could take you a while to find what you want.<br />This book's problems boil down to two things. It can't quite decide who it's aimed at: Writers who want guidance to help them write about something every day? Writers who think blank notebooks aren't good enough to do free-writing and take down observations in? It also can't quite decide what it wants to be: Is it an exercise workbook? Is it a journal with something interesting for people to write about every day? Is it a notebook for taking down observations in, that just happens to have quotes across the tops of the pages?<br /><br />Ultimately, I don't recommend this book. If you want a journal, you can do better by cutting neat quotes out of the newspaper, copying interesting exercises out of writing books, and pasting them at the tops of the pages in a blank notebook. And if you want neat prompts, there are plenty of books out there that will give you much more bang for your buck, like Heffron's &quot;The Writer's Idea Book&quot; or Rekulak's &quot;Writer's Block&quot;.ok.

She latched onto the woman's journey into the self: the tale of the descent of the goddess Innana. She connected this to such works as &quot;The Wizard of Oz,&quot; &quot;Titanic,&quot; and other stories and films, and decided a book was in order. Jack Heffron, editor of most of the writing books I've ever read &amp; reviewed, said sure, but what about the male hero while you're at it? And thus this book was born.<br />Ms. Schmidt discusses the difference between a stereotype and an archetype. She talks a bit about individualizing characters using aspects of appearance, what the characters care about and fear, motivations, how others see the character, and so on. When providing examples of each archetype she deliberately provides a wide spectrum of possibilities so that you can see some of the variations that are possible.<br />My only problem here is that I can still see, having read through the book, how it would be easy to accidentally get trapped into creating stereotypes using these character archetypes. Why? Because many of our stereotypes are variations on (or simplified, judgmental versions of) these archetypes, and it's hard not to let all that history influence us. Perhaps if Ms. Schmidt had included an extra (small) section within each archetype reminding the reader to play with things, and including a few further suggestions and examples for how to do so, it would have allayed this fear.<br />The archetypes are quite detailed. Each has both a positive and a negative side. The author includes all sorts of information about the archetypes, from things they tend to care about, to which other archetypes they pair well with, and what their assets and flaws tend to be. Then Ms. Schmidt does more in the list of examples to break the stereotype worry than she does anywhere else. She includes examples from TV, film, literature, and history, so no matter what your reading or viewing pleasure, you should find something you can relate to.<br />Oddly, while the character archetypes are what sell the book, they turned out not to be the main attraction for me. There's a great section on supporting characters, for example. But best of all, roughly a full 95 pages of the book cover the feminine and masculine archetypal journeys. This is where things really take off and catch at the imagination. All in all, this book is interesting, useful, and well-detailed.

Palumbo's, unfortunately, is not so spectacular, although it definitely has its merits.<br />One of Palumbo's best-conceived ideas is that in order to be happy with our writing, we must learn to enjoy the process for its own sake, not simply for external rewards such as sales and good reviews. I particularly like his view of writing as meditation, &quot;a hushed, private space&quot;--a calling more than a career. Palumbo talks about the problems all writers face, and it might help you to realize that you aren't so alone after all.<br />As much as I loved the good parts of Palumbo's book, however, there were definitely some parts I didn't like. For example, I took real issue with some of his claims regarding bipolar disorder, particularly his claim that bipolar is nothing more than an unhelpful label. As someone who HAS bipolar disorder (a genetically-inherited, biologically-based *illness*), and whose life was very much aided by the proper medication, I can say that such &quot;labels&quot; can be very helpful indeed! If you're worried about somehow losing your creativity if you medicate and calm your manic phases, I can personally testify to the fact that in many cases medication makes it much easier to actually sit down and take advantage of your creativity, rather than taking it away.<br />It is clear that Palumbo has some very strong feelings on certain matters, and every few chapters these feelings detract from the usefulness of the book. He bashes would-be writers who haven't yet written anything, comparing them to someone who says that they've always wanted to give heart surgery a try one of these weeks (the analogy holds merit in that writing requires skill, but falls apart in that writing requires more learning-by-doing, and can at least be attempted, explored, and practiced by the unskilled!). If there's one thing I took away from Maisel's book, it's that every writer was once a would-be writer. And the line between &quot;wanna-be&quot; and &quot;would-be&quot; isn't something we can assume just by looking at someone.<br />I don't recommend this book to the novice or &quot;would-be&quot; writer. Unlike Maisel's book, it's likely to give you a few skewed ideas about creativity and your own role in writing. On the other hand, it has a lot of very useful suggestions for writers who have some experience and are looking for help with the ups and downs of their craft.

There are some topics in here that sound interesting, including &quot;Writeriffic and You: Styling Your Creative Life&quot;,  &quot;Your Inner Writer&quot;,  &quot;Your Writer's Voice&quot;,  &quot;Creative Kick Starts&quot;, and &quot;Can You Make It as a Writer?&quot;. But don't get excited just yet; these only take up about 14 pages, largish print with very large section headings.<br />On the other hand, the advice here is useful. Ms. Shaw is the author of many (many!) books and magazine articles, and the teacher of an online class, and she has some practical and handy advice to pass on. Ms. Shaw strikes a nice balance between encouraging anyone who wants to try to write, and reminding us that writing takes skill and work.<br />I think the exercises are good. Not stunning. But certainly if you're having trouble getting started, the exercises provided here might get you going. Some of these are fairly traditional (pick a word at random from the dictionary and start writing on it). A few are actually a little different (cut photos from magazines of people and animals and match animal heads to people bodies. Write using your creation as a character). Technically there are 19 exercises. Many of them have plenty of possible variations, however, so if you don't get bored, they can keep you busy for a while.<br /><br />On the one hand, the single blank page that goes with each exercise might lower the barriers of resistance when you're trying to get yourself to do the first exercise or three. On the other hand, I hardly feel that it was necessary to make the latter two-thirds of the book entirely blank as well. The back of the book lists its price as $14.95--I can get a stack of cheap notebooks or scrap paper for that price (or just pop open a word processor window on my computer for even less)! I would be much happier to pay a third of that (maybe half) for the part of the book that contained text and exercises and buy my own paper. Ms. Shaw could done this without sacrificing the single blank page that goes with each exercise.<br />Ultimately, if you find this one in the bargain bin it's worth getting. It is not, however, worth the full cover price unless you have too much money on your hands.er for that price (or just pop open a word processor window on my computer for even less)!

Oh well--what works for one person doesn't work for another. I found some of the exercises similarly annoying, but again, everyone is different.<br /><br />At first the author of this book came across as exactly the sort of writing author I dislike--early in the book he seems to be saying, &quot;My way of writing is right for everyone.&quot; Given the wide variety of types of writing and writing styles out there, this is never a good claim to make. Luckily he turns out to be much more reasonable later in the book.<br /><br />Many of the author's hints are directed specifically at novel authors (in particularly, &quot;category&quot; or &quot;commercial&quot; novels). On the other hand, there's quite a bit of material in this book of use to any sort of fiction writer, so this isn't a big problem. Part 1 of the book is something of a general primer on creative thinking. Part 2 contains exercises for coming up with ideas related to specific projects. And part 3 addresses &quot;The Seven Habits Of Highly Effective Writers.&quot; I prefer other books when it comes to general creativity, but there are some great exercises in here to help you specifically address the needs of your particular projects.<br />This book is probably most useful for people who want to make the transition from writer to published writer. There's information on what publishers are looking for, how publishers think, and how you can catch their eye, and the focus is on creating fiction that will sell. I suggest, however, that you not accept everything in this book blindly. Read other books on writing as well. Use your own common sense. Experiment, play around, and see what works best for you.<br />As a book to help writers of commercial fiction, Alice Orr's &quot;No More Rejections&quot; might make a better choice. For a general-purpose creative thinking book, I recommend Mari Messer's &quot;Pencil Dancing,&quot; Monica Woods' &quot;The Pocket Muse,&quot; or Eric Maisel's &quot;The Creativity Book.&quot;i Messer's &quot;Pencil Dancing,&quot; Monica Woods' &quot;The Pocket Muse,&quot; or Eric Maisel's &quot;The Creativity Book.&quot;	2004-05-17

First, I have to say that this cookbook has the best guide I've ever found to figuring out the doneness of a cut of steak without having to slice it open and let out those wonderful juices. That alone made its purchase worthwhile. The rest of the book is organized by cut of steak. There's the tenderloin chapter, the T-bone chapter, porterhouse, strip or top loin, rib, rib-eye, sirloin, chuck, etc. Each chapter starts with information on that particular cut: what its texture and taste are like, how large and thick it tends to be, what it may be called by your butcher, and how it can best be cooked. If you really want to turn out the best steaks in town, it's hard to find a better resource than this cookbook!<br /><br />Some of the recipes in here are fairly standard. For instance, in the tenderloin chapter you'll find the classic &quot;Steak au Poivre,&quot; or peppercorn steak. Some recipes are twists on classics: such as Surf and Turf, Asian Style. Rice pulls recipes from various cuisines, such as Stuffed Filets with Ancho Sauce, Steak and Noodles Vietnamese Style, and Three-Pepper Fajitas. You'll also find a few recipes that won't quite fit your standard view of steak: Asian Beef Salad with Cucumber, for instance, or flank Steak Sandwiches with Red Pepper-Dill Ketchup. Some are his own recipes; others are from various other chefs. You'll also find appetizers and side dishes, from Beer and Cheese Spread to Mango Guacamole.<br /><br />New and interesting things are done with steak in this book; it's about as far as one can get from slapping it on the backyard barbecue two minutes before the football game. These are sumptuous and inventive dishes. But I think Mr. Rice realized that if he was going to put out a steak cookbook, he would have to cater to that other crowd as well. So every now and then you'll find him exhorting you to &quot;serve it with beer!&quot; (I think that last quotation should be imagined in a deep, manly voice.)<br />Not every recipe in this cookbook is equally stunning; some are merely mediocre.

Around the holidays I was in a bookstore and saw &quot;Celebrate with Chocolate&quot; (and oh dear, I was having a chocolate craving at the time)--I just had to bring it home. We immediately used a recipe out of it for my birthday cake (err, cakes--it produced a bunch of little cakes that look just like dominoes), and it was as superb as every other Marcel recipe I've ever had! Those little cakes were so densely fudgy that we ended up splitting them and topping them with ice cream so as to avoid falling over dead of a chocolate overdose.<br />Sadly this cookbook lacks the gorgeous photos you'll find throughout Marcel's death by chocolate series. Normally I don't really care one way or the other, but he's so darn artistic with his food that the photos really bring something extra to his cookbooks. At least there is a small section of photos in the middle so you aren't entirely deprived.<br />These are incredibly rich recipes, as evidenced by this note from the ingredients chapter: &quot;My admiration and love for butter has never wavered.&quot; Like Marcel's other recipes, these come in pieces. That is to say, instead of having one continuous recipe, a recipe is put together in stages and then assembled. Take Rolf's Old-World Black Forest Cake, for example. It includes a vanilla sugar cookie base, an old-world cocoa sponge cake, glazed cherries, &quot;just a hint of chocolate&quot; buttercream frosting, whipped cream, and chocolate curls. This makes it very easy to mix-and-match recipe components. As usual Marcel's recipes are long, but again this is because he details every step, ensuring a wonderful result. You don't need to be an expert in the kitchen to make his recipes, but you *do* need to be willing to spend real time and effort on a dish--these are show-stoppers, not simple fare.<br />If that isn't enough to convince you, here are a few recipe titles to get your mouth watering: Cocoa cinnamon chocolate chip shortcakes. White chocolate pumpkin cheesecakes with blackberry pixilation. Slammin' citrus squares with white chocolate-lemon balm icing. Champagne fritters with chocolate grape surprise and sparkling cream. Caramel orange-chocolate orange masquerade ice cream terrine...tcakes. White chocolate pumpkin cheesecakes with blackberry pixilation. Slammin' citrus squares with white chocolate-lemon balm icing.

When I made a handful of recipes from Deborah Madison's cookbook, &quot;Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone,&quot; I wasn't incredibly impressed with the flavors. Well, everything that her other cookbook isn't, this one is. &quot;The Greens Cookbook,&quot; based on the cooking of the Greens Restaurant in San Francisco, delivers enough fantastic flavors for any two cookbooks.<br />Recipes are laid out very well. This cookbook covers the basics right down to brown rice and egg pasta; it never leaves you stranded wondering if you have a recipe for such-and-such. Also included are seasonal menus, wine pairings with vegetarian food, a glossary of ingredients, and a list of useful kitchen tools.<br /><br />But this cookbook doesn't stop there. There's a Wild Rice and Hazelnut Salad that includes currants and orange juice. There's an Asparagus Soup that's quite good. The Mexican Vegetable Soup with Lime and Avocado is fantastic! There's a Basque Pumpkin and White Bean Soup, a Pumpkin Soup with Gruyere Cheese, a Grilled Tofu Sandwich, Creole Egg Salad Sandwich, Basil Fettucine with Green Beans Walnuts and Creme Fraiche, Spinach Noodle Pudding, Potatoes and Chanterelles Baked in Cream, Squash Stew with Chilies Spices and Ground Nuts, and an absolutely fantastic Cheese and Nut Loaf... among many other fantastic recipes.<br />This cookbook does occasionally call for the odd hard-to-find ingredient like hazelnut oil, but it doesn't get out of hand, and I think it's quite worth it. Ms. Madison takes her inspiration from all sorts of cuisines to wonderful effect. All in all this is a fantastic cookbook, whether or not you're a vegetarian!	2004-05-07

There's a lot of info such as how long to steam your lobster, and how many ounces of meat you're likely to get out of what size of lobster. The book includes recipes that call for lobster meat rather than whole lobsters, so if you're squeamish and don't want to buy whole critters, you can use those tubs of pre-cooked meat instead.<br />The recipes in here are truly inventive and luscious. How about the New England September Soup of Pumpkin, Sweet Corn and Lobster? Maybe Lobster Pizza, or Spaghetti with Lobster, Tomatoes and Capers, or Pappardelle with Lobster, Mushrooms, Shallots, and Cream. The baked stuffed lobster is one of the best recipes in this entire cookbook. We had this dish at Legal Seafood (where author/chef Jasper White has worked), but it wasn't as good as the one in the cookbook - the restaurant's stuffing tasted mostly like cracker, and this one has more to it than that.<br /><br />If you have a strong stomach and don't mind mucking with live lobsters, you can enjoy this cookbook to the fullest. But there are truly very few recipes that you can't make by using pre-cooked lobster meat. Lobster Ravioli, Avocado and Lobster Salad with Toasted Almonds, Warm Green Salad with Lobster, Mineola Oranges &amp; Citrus Vinaigrette, and so on. You'll find appetizers, sandwiches, cold plates, main courses, and even a section on &quot;Great Lobsters from Great Chefs.&quot;<br /><br />I'm not a lobster fiend like my husband, but I look forward to every use of this cookbook. Lobster meat may be expensive, but these recipes make a heck of a way to celebrate holidays and other special occasions.	2004-05-07

If you write thrillers, mysteries, romances, or other genre work, this is the perfect book for you. If you don't, it will still hold a lot of value, but some of the more sweeping statements won't ring as true. The title of the book sounds gimmicky, but the book itself isn't. I thought from the title that this would be one of those books that would promise you publication if only you followed these simple rules, but it doesn't.<br />Author Alice Orr is also a long-time editor, so she knows what editors look for. Her &quot;secrets&quot; run the gamut from ideas, to beginnings, characters (both primary and secondary), drama, middles, writing style, endings, and even submissions and self-promotion.<br />Many of these ideas won't be new to writers who've been around a while. We know we need strong protagonists, dramatic beginnings, and so on. However, Orr does more than just give us a rule to follow. She backs up those rules with directions, examples, exercises, questions to ask ourselves, and more. She takes abstract concepts and turns them into concrete practices. She tells us how far editors want us to take our dramatic beginnings and strong characters, as well as how far they *don't* want us to take them.<br />In short, any writer of commercial fiction who is unsatisfied with her acceptance rate will probably find something of value in here. Regardless, Orr's witty style makes this a fun book to read!	2004-05-07

The other two are &quot;Wraps&quot; and &quot;Smoothies,&quot; and they're every bit as good. These women have a knack for often unusual, very flavorful food with very strange names. This book includes a number of good hints for any occasion at which you wish to serve finger food. They even give figures for how many hors d'oeuvres and drinks to serve. Then you'll find directions for pairing hors d'eouvres with drinks, and a couple of &quot;themes&quot; for possible parties.<br /><br />Weird recipe names is one way in which this cookbook stands out. How could you forget a cookbook with recipes like &quot;oink!&quot; and &quot;steaked and thai-ed?&quot; Mind you, when someone asks me what those marvelous little delicacies are over there on the table, you can bet I'll be saying &quot;oh, that's skewered thai-style steak with lime, jalapeno, and mint.&quot; Unless, of course, the questioner is either a very good friend or someone I'd like to irritate.<br />&quot;Bold flavors&quot; has become a cliche. When I think of bold in relation to cooking I think of bland A-1 steak sauce ads. But when the Corpening sisters get together, bold is the most appropriate adjective I can think of. Bayou Biscuits give you the distinctive flavor of Andouille sausage. Delhi Blues is a combination of blue cheese and walnut shortbread with chutney! The Smoked Salmon Bonbons are exquisite. We like to use the tahini-ginger dipping sauce that's meant to go with shrimp and serve it with shrimp chips instead.<br /><br />You'll find more recipes like this throughout the book--bold, exquisite symphonies of flavor that bowl you over. However, because the flavors are so strong, a few of them are almost bound to be ones you find unpleasant. No matter how they dress it up, I'll never do more than shrug over shrimp, and no one will ever convince me to eat a dish with onion as a main ingredient. For you it might be the radishes, or maybe the aforementioned blue cheese. This book is certainly worth a buy, though, regardless of whether you like cocktail parties.

Each recipe has several components to it, and two variations on top of that to top things off. One of my favorite recipes in this book is &quot;Sliced Beets with Curly Endive, Red Bliss Potato Salad, Honey Mustard Roasted Walnuts, and Meaux Mustard Vinaigrette.&quot; I'm not normally fond of beets, but they're fantastic in this recipe. The honey mustard roasted walnuts have the perfect blend of sharp and sweet tastes. There are a couple of ingredients you might have trouble finding, but they're generally things you can easily substitute for. The first variation for this recipe is the Walnut-Crusted Striped Bass, and there's also a Honey Duck Stir-Fry variation.<br />Each recipe has the same &quot;Chef's Touch&quot; section as in &quot;Death by Chocolate,&quot; giving suggestions for substitution (the aforementioned mustard), storage, and so on, including even wine suggestions in some cases. My only negative comment on this recipe was that the vinaigrette was too oily for our taste, but it's easy enough to reduce the amount of oil. Each recipe serves four hungry people, and could easily be stretched to 6 or 8 as a side dish.<br /><br />If you're familiar with Desaulniers' &quot;Death by Chocolate&quot; series, then you're already familiar with his cookbook style. He describes everything in detail, not because it's necessarily complex, but because he wants to make sure he doesn't leave anything out or confuse the reader. Also, while his recipes are usually calculated to be not overly difficult, they do tend to be time-consuming, and often involve a handful of different components that need to be put together. You don't need to be an expert to use his cookbooks, but you do need to be willing to spend time and effort in the kitchen.<br />But as always, he truly comes through in the flavor department. Peppered Honey Peaches with Warm Pecan Cakes, &quot;Bitter&quot; Salad Greens, and Sour Mash Vinaigrette. Variations: Turkey Scallopine with Basil and Zinfandel; Pecan-Crusted Soft-Shell Crab. Or maybe you'd prefer Mandarin Orange Basmati Rice with Sesame Stir-Fried Vegetables, Tangy Red Cabbage, and Szechuan Peppercorn Vinaigrette.

How microwaves heat as opposed to ovens, grills, broilers, and stove tops? Anyone who explains the way that cooking with water works by drawing diagrams of Lucy and Ethel eating candies from a conveyor belt has got to have a few screws loose, right? Or maybe he's finally hit on an interesting way to explain something most people would find boring! Alton Brown maintains that if you know and understand the basics, you can do pretty much anything you want in the kitchen.<br /><br />To this end he includes &quot;master profiles&quot; of basic techniques, like searing. He gives us all the info we need to master the basic technique and move on, and there's always that little Alton touch of humor somewhere in there. For each method presented, there are also several recipes. In the case of searing you'll find Skirt Steak: the Master Recipe, Cast-Iron Duck, Red Flannel Hash, Bar-B-Fu, Blackened Tuna Steak, and Pan-Seared Portobello Mushrooms.<br />We've made quite a few recipes from this cookbook, all of which have ranged from solidly good to absolutely splendiferous. The fried calamari is the most tender, crispy fried calamari I've ever had in my entire life. I never though I'd like corn dogs, but when given the typical Alton spin-job, the recipe is top-notch! The brined and roasted turkey has become our standard recipe--everyone raves about our amazingly juicy and flavorful turkey. One of our first thoughts upon trying the fried tofu (right after &quot;OH MY GOD!&quot;) was, &quot;hey, I bet mushrooms would be really good marinated and fried like this!&quot;  (And they were.)<br />There are some mild negatives. While the directions are clear and well-laid-out, it seems like Alton occasionally forgets a tiny detail (nothing serious like whole recipe steps--just little things it would have been nice to know). The color scheme of this book is really ugly. Since this book just covers basic cooking techniques, Alton doesn't get into baking and stuff. And, lastly, the index is poor. If you want to find a specific recipe, you're better off remembering the basic cooking technique and looking it up that way.

The &quot;Maxwell House Coffee Drinks &amp; Desserts Cookbook&quot; starts off with some information &amp; history on coffee and &quot;The Maxwell House Story,&quot; followed by some information about brewing &amp; serving coffee. The brewing &amp; serving tricks are fairly standard. The rest of the book seems a little arbitrarily divided up. The sections are: Breakfast &amp; Brunch; Coffee Break; Lunch; Afternoon Coffee Time; Dinner; After the Show; Midnight Snack. This means that if you want to find a certain kind of recipe, you should look in the index instead of trying to find the right chapter. After all, there are plenty of things that could work equally well for any of the above coffee times. The beginning of each chapter has a list of the recipes in it, though, which helps. The layout of the recipes is great, and most recipes are quite short and simple. Prep time and baking time are provided up front! The ingredients are set off from the instructions quite well, and the instructions are broken up into manageable chunks.<br />The beverages are simple, and some of them made me shrug. We already do things like add cinnamon or vanilla to our coffee, so those recipes don't add anything new to our repertoire.  On the other hand, there are things like the &quot;Shake Awake Smoothie,&quot; with double-strength coffee, banana, vanilla yogurt, sugar, and ice cubes. Simple it may be, but it's also yummy! Some recipes call for instant mixes, which may rub some people the wrong way. The hot chocolate cappuccino is just milk, chocolate, and instant cappuccino mix, for example.<br />The desserts include shortcakes with espresso cream, Hawaiian dessert sauce, cappuccino sticky buns, coffee cream cheese for your bagels, coffee cinnamon cream cheese brownies, banana caramel cafe pie, cafe panna cotta, caffe latte bread pudding, tiramisu cheesecake, and much more. Many of the recipes come with wonderful pictures.<br /><br />This is an absolutely wonderful cookbook, and every recipe we've tried from it has come out perfectly.

The course (developed from workshops Lloyd teaches) starts with the assumption that maybe you have a yearning to do something different with your life, but you don't yet know what that is or, at least, how to do it. Starting with a &quot;daily action&quot; and moving on to some material on idea generation and abstraction, Lloyd mixes thoughts on creativity (&quot;It's good to simply look at your lived experience and separate it from your concepts about 'life.'&quot;) with concrete exercises and interviews with successful creative people from all walks of life: teachers, painters, actors, writers, inventors, entrepreneurs, performance artists, dancers, directors, and more.<br />A book like this won't bandage up your life and make everything better in five easy steps. It won't reveal a magical key that will show you how to make millions from your watercolors. But it can help you to see your life a bit more clearly. It can help you to see the options and resources you might have missed, and it can help you to figure out what needs you have, creatively speaking, and how best to fulfill them.<br />Questions encourage you to take both the short and the long view, the practical and the ideal. Lloyd helps you to let go of your preconceptions by having you write down everything, no matter how silly, and by sharing stories of people who succeeded by doing what everyone told them they shouldn't do. So if you're already snugly fitted into your creative career, you'll have little use for this book. But if you're struggling to figure out what to do next or where to go, this book could help you turn your interests and desires into a concrete plan of action that fulfills both emotional and practical needs.	2004-05-03

For example, all her tales of benefits people have gained from her workshop would sound self-congratulatory if the tone were more formal. &quot;Soul&quot; is about figuring out your life, trying things until you find out what works for you, and heading off in a better direction than the one you rode in on.<br /><br />Ms. Gray has a wonderful sense of poetry. Her prose is a little rougher, with some interesting typos and mistakes here and there, but I've seen far worse and did enjoy her style quite a bit. Each chapter (or section of chapter) ends up with several specific sections. One is called &quot;journeys,&quot; and suggests topics for freewrites that involve the concepts just discussed. &quot;Food for thought&quot; is a sort of free-association list. Finally, each section ends with &quot;seasonal surrenders.&quot; These are little rituals you can use to remind yourself of the divinity and specialness of life.<br />There are definitely some things about this book I didn't like. It's a bit new-agey for me. In particular, the section on angels annoyed me. The tone of the section left me with the impression that angels were supposed to be silly, cherubic beings playing pranks on people for fun. Ms. Gray sometimes refers to things as being &quot;medical fact,&quot; or having been shown through research, as though research automatically confers validity--there's plenty of flawed research out there.<br />Ultimately, there are several considerations to keep in mind when deciding whether you want to read this book:<br />1.  If you want a serious book on writing, you probably want a different book.<br />2.  If you want a book on exploring spirituality through writing, this is probably a great book for you.<br />3.

Ever wanted to know why you have to punch steam vents in your crust? Not sure how to tell when your pie is done? Does your bottom crust always come out soggy, not golden and firm? This book can solve your problems--never have the bottom crusts on our apple pies come out so well!<br /><br />The book includes &quot;A Pie Maker's Guide to Apple Varieties.&quot; It would help if I could actually find more than four or five apple varieties at our store, of course. But at least it tells me the characteristics of the various apple varieties so I can substitute an appropriate variety for the exotic ones called for in some of these recipes. (It also helps that recipes often include notes such as this one from the grated apple pie recipe: &quot;The original Pennsylvania Dutch recipe calls for Winesap apples, but any firm, juicy, tart apple, including Granny Smith, will do.&quot;) By the time you're done you'll be able to make whatever kind of apple pie you like best, whether that's mushy or firm, juicy or dry, sweet or tart. You'll also find little &quot;helper&quot; recipes in here, like various crust recipes, sauces, and so on.<br />The layout is clean and clear. Ingredients are delineated by crust, filling, topping, and so on. Direction steps are numbered and broken down into short steps. There's one short spread of color photo pages in the middle of the book, so you can stare at the frozen apple and peanut butter cloud pie and die of sugar shock. We have stumbled across one instance of slightly confused directions so far, but it was easy to figure out how to fix it, and that was the only incident. There's a good index in the back of the book (you can look up recipes by type of apple), and the table of contents lists out each individual pie with page number.<br />Every single recipe we've made from this book has come out completely and utterly delicious. I'm usually disappointed by apple pie, but not by the pies from this cookbook! Even when they aren't my favorite texture or taste, they're still so good that I don't mind! And they're creative and unusual, guaranteed to keep us from ever becoming bored with apple pie again (apple and brie hand pies, anyone?). So if you enjoy apple pie and don't mind straying a little from the beaten path, this cookbook truly is &quot;Apple Pie Perfect.&quot;or taste, they're still so good that I don't mind!

Since I lived in Boston for a while I had the distinct pleasure of eating cakes that had actually been made at Rosie's Bakery. Sadly, after a while the quality dropped. For example, the icings started to taste more of shortening than of butter. Now, however, I can reclaim the original favorites in my own kitchen. As the title &quot;All-Butter, Fresh Cream, Sugar-Packed&quot; indicates, these recipes at least stick to using premium ingredients.<br />Each chapter starts off with some of the things Judy Rosenberg learned along the way, and her explanations for how to make these things work. Little things like lining cake pans with parchment paper, cooling cake layers in pans, etc. If you're a relatively new cook it'll be very useful. If you're an experienced cook it might be worth a glance through to see if there are any tricks you haven't picked up yet.<br />There are some truly decadent treats in here: this is not a cookbook you should use while dieting! You'll find Rosie's Famous Chocolate Sour-Cream Cake Layers, Queen Raspberry Cake, and one of our favorites, Cold Fudge Sundae Cake, which involves whipped cream and raspberries. In the fruit arena you'll find a Bittersweet Orange Cake with a Lemon Glaze, an Applesauce Raisin Cake, Mustard Gingerbread, etc. You'll even find a few cheesecakes, as well as a handful of frostings and fillings. I think a little more variety would have been nice, but the things that are here are quite good.  I'm not entirely sure why there's a cookie chapter here since there's an entirely separate Rosie's Bakery &quot;Cookie Book.&quot; It seems a bit redundant, particularly for those people interested in buying both. There are also bar cookies, pies and tarts, custards and puddings, and so on; the custards and puddings are my favorites.<br />I'm not overly fond of the layout of this book. The little hearts all over the place and the pink chapter intro pages are a bit much. Chapter titles like &quot;Cutie Pies&quot; come off as saccharine--titles are often puns. The layout isn't very user-friendly. The quality of the food rates a five, but the presentation issues are just enough to bring it down a bit. Call my rating a 4.5.-titles are often puns.

Many include a paragraph somewhere indicating the &quot;core concept&quot; of the chapter, set off with a gray background. Finally the book ends with a bibliography--which doubles as a rather nice reading list. A fair amount of time is spent on the emotions and feelings involved in writing, which is entirely appropriate to a book with a title like &quot;Write from the Heart&quot;!<br /><br />You'll find material on making peace with your inner critic (a subject discussed in &quot;Pencil Dancing&quot; but dealt with in greater depth here). There's a chapter on creating a system of supportive critiquing with other writers, and a chapter that deals with the subject of small, independent book publishers--something I haven't seen talked about in many places.<br />While I do very much like this book, it did suffer from some balance problems. As the title indicates, it's a book for writers. In large part, however, it's a memoir. It's also a book on spirituality. I felt as though Mr. Bennett lost focus now and then--forgot what his main topic and audience were. I sometimes felt as though the bits of memoir scattered throughout weren't adequately related back to the topic at hand and went on for longer than they needed to. While Mr. Bennett did make fascinating connections between elements of spirituality and elements of writing, sometimes he failed to connect them well enough. A few chapters seemed to focus almost entirely on spirituality with writing concerns added as an afterthought.<br />The spirituality of this book is not what I would consider offensive. It delves into such topics as spirit guides and the &quot;invisible world,&quot; but is (usually) careful to remain grounded in reality and anchored to the topic of writing. It will make die-hard skeptics uncomfortable in places, but it is interesting, and some of the ideas are worth a try. They might indeed give you new ways in which to approach your writing.  Ultimately this is a very helpful book, and I highly recommend it for people who would like to achieve more with their writing than commercial success alone.g, and some of the ideas are worth a try.

Then it's time to bite the bullet and make your own.<br /><br />You'll find details on ice cream machines in this book, as well as the differences between (and pros and cons of) ice cream made with and without eggs, details on flavoring ice creams, and tips for making &quot;mix-ins&quot; (cookies, crackers, etc.) that'll stay crunchy longer. You'll even find three recipes for ice cream cones in here!<br />This cookbook packs a lot of punch into a surprisingly small amount of space. Let's use Pumpkin Ice Cream as an example. Below it you have four variations listed: Pumpkin Pie Ice Cream, Pumpkin Raisin Ice Cream, Pumpkin Rum Ice Cream, and Pumpkin Seed Ice Cream. Mr. Weinstein could have done this a number of ways. He could have printed up a new recipe for each variation. He could have left them out entirely. Or he could have put the traditional paragraph of &quot;oh, and you could try adding this, and this, or this.&quot; In the first case you pay more for a cookbook that could have been smaller. In the middle case, we would have been bereft of many extra fantastic recipes. In the last case, when we sat down to pick a recipe and make out our grocery list, we would have failed to read the last paragraph, and we'd eternally find ourselves saying &quot;Oh, next time,&quot; without ever making the variations. So this is PERFECT. I wish more cookbooks did this. The variations are 1-3 sentence quick directions, but easy to pick out and implement. They're also listed as individual recipes in the index, so you won't have trouble finding them if you lose them.<br /><br />You'll find a fantastic array of flavors. Apple Butter Ice Cream, for instance. Avocado Ice Cream, with a Gazpacho recipe to accompany it--I guess you can eat ice cream for dinner! The Banana Ice Cream and the Banana Ice Cream Philadelphia Style (no eggs) come with a stunning array of variations. When Mr. Weinstein suggests Bubble Gum Ice Cream, he even provides the toll-free number of a company that sells bubble gum flavoring! Now that's service for you. The book also includes sorbets, granitas, toppings, and ice cream drinks.<br />In all, this is the best ice cream book I've ever laid my hands on, and we have at least four such cookbooks. Mr. Weinstein has created a true treasure of ice cream creation, and deserves no less than a full five stars for his glorious work.Ice Cream, with a Gazpacho recipe to accompany it--I guess you can eat ice cream for dinner!

You'll find historical details on many of the recipes, quotes from interesting people, and useful tips and hints. I particularly love the &quot;Equivalent Pan Sizes&quot; chart. Richard Sax goes into a fair amount of detail about what, for example, a cobbler really is, and how it differs from crisps, brown Bettys, crumbles, pandowdies, and shortcakes.<br /><br />This book is heavy on the fruit; you'll find a recipe for whatever is in season. There are cobblers, crisps, compotes, baked fruit, fools, jellies, fruitcakes, pies, tarts, etc. If it's the dead of winter and you just can't find good fruit, you'll still find plenty to work with. There are puddings, custards, souffles, dumplings, cookies, cakes, coffee cakes, cheesecakes, custard pies, pastries, and so on. And these recipes are good. I really mean *good.* Here I see the huge star we put next to the Mixed Fruit Cobbler. Turn the page and you'll see a gorgeous picture of Panna Cotta and Poached Pears in Merlot Syrup. Yet another large ball-point pen star graces the New Hampshire &quot;Plate Cake.&quot;<br />You'll find new and old recipes here. Recipes by people you've never heard of as well as big-name chefs (on p. 163 you'll find Jasper White's Maple Sugar Creme Caramel). My favorite cookies are M.F.K. Fisher's Ginger Hottendots. Trust me--no one can eat just five, and they travel well in the mail at holiday-time.<br /><br />With this much variety you won't like everything you find. But this book is well worth what you pay for it for the sheer volume of recipes, the quality, and the ease of production. I predict you'll find, as we did, that this book becomes a staple in your kitchen.	2004-05-03
US	32860001	R2RD2JLLKLLH0U	1884910424	530590226	Novelists Notebook	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A first-aid kit for novelists	&quot;The Novelist's Notebook&quot; is a neat idea. It's a journal (there are blank spots on pages where you're supposed to write things) in which you play with exercises and ideas in an effort to improve and aid your novel-writing. It's broken up into six sections: Planning, Beginning to Write, Necessities, Possibilities, When You're Stuck, and Double-Checking and Revising. The table of contents helpfully lists out every exercise, so you can find whatever you need at a moment's notice. Even the shortest chapter has 13 exercises; the longest has close to 30. So whatever your novel-writing inclinations, there should be plenty of things in here that you can make use of.<br /><br />Perhaps the best detail about the book is that it unabashedly makes use of variety. Where you find material on planning out your novel, you'll also find material on writing without an outline. Where one novelist is quoted as saying that only insane writers allow their characters to decide what happens, another is quoted as explaining that this is the key to her success. The book shows by example that what works for one author will not work for another. It merely suggests that you play with all of the various tools available until you find the ones that work *for you.* This might help the beginning writer to find the confidence to pick and choose her own techniques, rather than mindlessly doing what some opinionated writer once told her to do. Seeing such contradictory and decisive quotes from writers makes it clear that just because one writer thinks it's the only way to do things doesn't necessarily mean a thing.<br /><br />If this book has any flaw at all, it is that you'll probably only find a couple dozen pages with material that will work for you over and over again, and many of these techniques have been covered in other books. However, as long as you copy the exercises rather than writing in the book, you'll be able to use them over and over with each successive novel you write. You can even photocopy the ones that work for you and keep them together in an individually-tailored packet.even photocopy the ones that work for you and keep them together in an individually-tailored packet.	2004-05-03

Jack Heffron's &quot;The Writer's Idea Book&quot; is a very good specimen of a book of writers' exercises. It mixes &quot;prompts&quot; of various sorts (more than 400 of them according to the cover, and I believe it!) with short riffs of practical advice on a wide range of writing matters. While Heffron is a professional editor and does give advice regarding methods that he believes work best, he concentrates on writing for yourself in this book rather than trying to get published. This is just the idea phase after all--check out his later book, &quot;The Writer's Idea Workshop,&quot; for practical advice regarding taking your idea from raw ore to refined metal.<br />There are many prompts meant to help you mine your own experiences for ideas and plots. (As well as your likes and dislikes, your family, your home town, places you've visited, &quot;public moments,&quot; secrets, dreams, and more.) There are prompts to help you explore different forms of writing, structure your story, and more. There are even good solid hints on dealing with openings and endings. The huge number of prompts in this book guarantees that you should be able to find something to spark your creativity no matter what mood you're in.<br />In fact, about the only thing that bothered me about this book was the lack of the unusual. I love genre. Horror, science fiction, fantasy--I love the strange, and this book had a very &quot;literary&quot; feel to it. That'll make it perfect for many other writers out there, but it left me a little flat. I like to have a certain otherworldliness come into play when looking through lots of writing exercises and warm-ups. This book is meant to push you into finding inspiration from the ordinary rather than the extraordinary; I would have liked a better balance.<br />It's certainly a fun book, however, and definitely a kick in the inspiration department!	2004-04-28

Each one is colorful and decorative, and each one has a phrase on it. You mix the cards up, pick one, and use it to spark your journal-writing for that day. The cards are huge--these are definitely larger than any tarot cards I've seen! This means they're nigh-impossible to shuffle. However, they're also incredibly beautiful. They layer images of leaves, puzzle pieces, and so on with unusual papers, paintings, and scenes. The words and phrases are interesting, with such examples as &quot;Choices,&quot; &quot;Crossroads,&quot; &quot;Doorways,&quot; &quot;My greatest fear,&quot; and &quot;Explore the Possibility.&quot; They're a bit on the abstract and generic side, but if you haven't journaled before and aren't sure how to start, then I think they'll give you a nice push.<br />While the cards are inspiring, the book is less so. The introduction by Charlene is warm and friendly, but other parts of the book devolve into clinical seminar-speak. The language would feel at home in a sterile $19.95 video tape for sale on an infomercial, not in a book that started out with warmth and presents such lush cards as inspiration.<br />The book briefly addresses why it can be helpful to keep a journal, and what you can get out of the experience. The brief sections and thoughts provided to go with each card (like a tarot deck's accompanying book) are nice, but they stick to the shallows for the most part, with a few easy suggestions and minor thoughts to help you out. The best section in this book is the one on writing techniques--I hadn't thought much about the variety of ways in which one can approach journaling, and this section definitely inspired a few ideas.<br />This set would help someone who wants to journal but isn't sure where to start. The cards would make nice prompts for any sort of writer. And lastly, the set makes a great collector item for someone with a taste for beautiful tarot-like cards. For the experienced journaler, however, this set doesn't offer much beyond the writing techniques and the pretty pictures. I'd give the cards five stars and the book three; in the balance I'll average it out to four.es a great collector item for someone with a taste for beautiful tarot-like cards.

He's a psychotherapist and &quot;creativity consultant,&quot; and he has written a number of books on writing, art, and creativity. Several of them are among my favorite writing books: &quot;Living the Writer's Life,&quot; &quot;Deep Writing,&quot; and &quot;Write Mind.&quot; Unlike those books, &quot;The Creativity Book&quot; is not aimed specifically at writers. It's aimed at you, me, your brother, and the guy in the cubicle down the hall. In other words, anyone who'd like to use a little more creativity in their lives, whether for painting, writing, mathematics, relationships, or business plans.<br />The book is designed to be read one section at a time, to take you through a year of learning. It has 88 sections, two per week, to get you through ten months, and then the idea is that you spend the last two months of your year devoted to a particular creative project. Each base section is pretty short--generally a page or three--so you'll have no trouble reading it in a few spare minutes some evening. Then it's followed by at least one exercise, and sometimes several. Sometimes the exercises are very specific; at other times, Maisel suggests ways to apply the exercises to whatever area you're trying to become more creative in.<br />Many of the ideas in the book are relatively basic, but this in no way makes them useless. After all, they're only basic for people who are already highly creative and making abundant use of that creativity. In large part this book is designed to help those who aren't sure where to start when it comes to creativity, and who haven't had much luck sitting down and getting started with their creative projects. Even highly creative people will still find things of value in this book, however. Some sections will feel like remedial schooling, but others might unlock surprising ways for you to move forward in your work. People with more experience using their creativity might prefer to skip from section to section instead of following the &quot;plan,&quot; however, using the bits that have particular value to them.o section instead of following the &quot;plan,&quot; however, using the bits that have particular value to them.	2004-04-28

It includes three types of content: &quot;Spark words&quot; pair a single word or phrase with a photograph. Many are meant to be ambiguous or controversial; others are simply meant to be challenging, interesting, or unusual. &quot;Writing topics&quot; provide a brief discussion of some issue in writing, usually relating it to various published and well-known writers. &quot;Writing challenges&quot; give you short assignments--exercises you can play with and try out.<br />The sheer volume of photos, words, exercises, and writing suggestions is astonishing! Beyond that, however, I'd call this book very good, but not amazing. The spark words are interesting; the photos didn't wow me quite as much, however. Many of them had that excessively posed look to them; most of them seemed to illustrate the most stereotypical or expected aspect of the spark word rather than leading the reader to new ideas.<br />The three different types of content are scattered nicely throughout, making it quite easy, if you're looking specifically for a spark word or challenge, to find one no matter what page you open up to. Certainly you'll be able to make use of this little block for a long time to come without running out of material.<br />Also, while the &quot;writer's block&quot; cube is a cute gimmick, it does have a downside. When I first opened it I found the pages very stiff and difficult to open all the way. Once I'd played around with it for a short while the binding started to separate from the pages even though I handled it very carefully. Perhaps it would have been better to sell these as cards in a memo cube. That way there'd be no worry about a binding falling apart, and it would even be easy to sell later bunches of cards to supplement the stack.<br />All in all, a worthwhile purchase for any writer. How could you not enjoy having that many words, photos, exercises, and suggestions to play with? Just go easy on your little cube's binding, and try not to let the photos trap you into thinking about the spark words in expected ways.or any writer.

Okay, Ms. Allen doesn't call it free-writing; she explains it as though it's something new. However, she does have a rather new and interesting approach to the use of free-writing, and that has value.<br />She directly relates these exercises to the short short story form. She also sees the five-minute exercise as a stepping stone, or building block, when working on longer fiction. She presents a great deal of information on the use of these exercises in the creation of short stories, novels and novellas, in terms of both method and revision.<br />Unfortunately, the text of this book rambles, babbles, and repeats itself; don't read this book while you're sleepy or bored. The five-minute exercise method itself is quite fascinating, however. The ideas for working these exercises into longer pieces save this book from being a simple rehashing of free-writing and turn it into a collection of very interesting ideas.<br />She makes the point that when free-writing, you need to allow yourself to &quot;make a mess.&quot; You can't be thinking of comma usage if you want to see what your unconscious mind has waiting for you. On the other hand, when discussing examples from her students' work, she describes &quot;mistakes&quot; they made as being ones of &quot;carelessness.&quot; If she wants people who read her book to let go and write what comes into their heads, then it's a bad idea to indicate that making mistakes would be careless of them.<br />This isn't a perfect book, and you have to be willing to look past a few small issues, but the ideas are innovative and useful. If you're looking for a new way to jump-start your creativity, this book can be a lot of fun!	2004-04-25

The idea is that you go through the cards (one at a time, at random, several at a time, or however else you like) and, if you need more inspiration than the simple phrase, you pull out the book and look up the card. Most of the cards are meant to inspire ways of writing, rather than content. I had been expecting the latter, so I was slightly disappointed to have gotten the former. However this is still very useful stuff. You might also be able to adapt some of these cards to inspire content instead of methods, as long as you use the cards and not the book. Each card's description in the book starts off by giving specific examples of how the technique is used by one (or usually several) well-known writers. Then it goes on to suggest some ways that you could apply it to your own writing.<br />A few examples include: Observe a Ritual, Locate the Fear, Take a Walk, Write a Letter, Think Architecturally, and Conduct an Interview. Much of this isn't terribly new--mostly what you're getting out of this is the deck of cards that makes randomization easy, and the booklet that includes examples, interpretations, and so on.<br />My only real problem with this product was the cards themselves. They're plain, with a phrase in olive green on a white background, sans artwork. Unfortunately, they give the impression of someone who has just recently discovered that you can make nifty font-sizes and put words in odd places with a word processor, and who went a little nuts with it. In other words, it alternately comes across as pretentious and silly.<br />If you already have a method of working that you enjoy then these cards will probably be of limited value to you. On the other hand, you can use the book like a series of exercises if you need to expand your range a bit, break through a case of writer's block, or get started on your writing. They can be handy when you're having a bit of a creativity drought, and they could be quite useful to aspiring writers who could use a little help.your writing.

The idea is that you take a &quot;prompt&quot; or exercise of some kind, set a timer for 5, 10, or 15 minutes, and then write. This isn't the kind of writing where you plan and organize and outline--you just write whatever comes into your head and keep writing. This is supposed to help you turn off your inner critic and get down to the really creative stuff. In &quot;Fast Fiction,&quot; Allen specifically applied this technique to the creation of the short-short story, and to the creation of longer pieces of writing from smaller building-blocks. In &quot;The Playful Way to Serious Writing,&quot; she's sticking with the simple idea of just getting started and being creative, without worrying about what comes next.<br />Allen does a wonderful job of establishing a childlike tone to the book. The font is large and plain, and looks a bit like a child's handwriting. The sentences are short and direct, kind of like what you'd expect to hear from a child. Allen discusses events from her own childhood, and the prompts seem to evoke a child's curiosity and lack of understanding about the world. She talks about the energy that some words and ideas have, always capitalizing it (&quot;ENERGY&quot;)--it seems a little bit silly, but again, it's the sort of thing you can imagine a child doing. This helps to establish a tone and sense of freedom--it helps to disable that inner critic so the child in you can come out and play without fear.<br />There isn't much to distinguish the prompts and exercises themselves from those in any other writing book (like Heffron's &quot;The Writer's Idea Book,&quot; Shaw's &quot;Writerrific,&quot; or Rekulak's &quot;The Writer's Block&quot;). But the tone of the book itself is certainly more conducive to helping us shed our serious, adult critic-minds and return to a more playful, childlike attitude. And this can be a handy thing for anyone having trouble tapping into their creative side. This approach isn't for everyone, but if it sounds like fun, you might enjoy this book!nd return to a more playful, childlike attitude.

When you're in flow, you become so deeply immersed in your writing, or whatever activity you're doing, that you forget yourself and your surroundings.&quot;<br />Susan Perry, a social psychologist and writer, decided to do her doctoral dissertation on the subject of flow. She conducted interviews, sent out questionnaires, and collected previously existing information. She wanted to know how writers experienced flow, how they got into flow, and whether their experiences could be generalized to help other writers find their way into flow. The author believes that writers can and do have at least a certain amount of control over whether or not they enter flow, and she presents five &quot;master keys&quot; for achieving flow, along with supporting anecdotes and details.<br />Even if the author had stopped with those five master keys, this book would be very useful. But she goes on to present much more information. You'll find more material on flow within the context of a writer's life. Frequently asked questions are answered in sidebars throughout the text. Specific techniques for luring the flow state are discussed (ritual and routine, clutter and lack thereof, timing, music, silence, meditation, tools, and more). The author also discusses the concept of writer's block, and, more specifically, what that means, how it affects flow, and what you can do about it.<br />On the one hand, the wild mix of perspectives is fantastic and extremely educational. There's also the amusement value of seeing several writers self-importantly declare that writing must be done a certain way, only to see several others contradict them. This really is a good lesson in the fact that almost no writing advice is entirely universal. On the other hand, I felt that the author allowed the quotes and interview excerpts to take too much control of the book. Because of this, I sometimes had trouble telling which chapter I was in and which topic the author was discussing. This led to some confusion, and kept some of the author's points from coming through as clearly as they should have.<br />If you have any interest whatsoever in &quot;writing in flow,&quot; I strongly suggest that you read this book. While flow is not necessary in order to write well, and the author does mention authors who told her that they never enter flow, flow is certainly a more fun and pleasurable way in which to write (for most people, anyway). Also, if you're one of those people whose parents or teachers berated them for daydreaming, you might enjoy finding out that such a state can be a job skill.

The introduction of &quot;Instant Gratification&quot; goes into the elements of a good 15-minute dessert, like a streamlined ingredient list and carefully-constructed recipes. Ms. Chattman also goes into ways that you can make your recipes go faster, like being organized and working deliberately. The 15-minute mark, by the way, doesn't include things like baking time or chilling time. It's for the actual work you have to do. The intro also discusses various time-saving kitchen implements and ingredients.<br /><br />Only one of the chapters (&quot;When You've Got to Have It: Unbelievable Desserts in 15 Minutes Flat&quot;) actually guarantees you a 15-minute time frame. The others might take you, oh... 20 minutes. Or 25. And the recipes aren't just quick, they're easy. They come with lists of equipment so you won't get caught short.<br />My only gripe with this cookbook is that some of the ingredient measurements are a little off. For instance, we found that the amount of gelatin called for in a couple of chilled recipes wasn't quite enough. Otherwise, however, the tastes are fabulous! For example, we made the White Chocolate-Mint Truffles. Bet you didn't think you could make truffles in just a few minutes, huh? Well, okay, we were dubious too. The only thing that took a little time with the truffles was chopping the white chocolate. Then you add some hot ingredients and melt it into one big mass. You add the mint extract and refrigerate. Once it's set, you sit down with a bowl of cocoa powder. You dig out bits of white chocolate goo,  roll them into balls, roll them in the cocoa powder, and stick them in the refrigerator. That's it! And oh, were they delicious--as has been every single other recipe we've made from this book.<br />So if you sometimes need a dessert in a hurry, or just want to take a break and make something quick and easy, &quot;Instant Gratification&quot; is a great cookbook to have around!	2004-04-24

Abstract concepts are conveyed in ways that apply to your everyday life and work. Ms. Simon provides interesting and surprising insights into our feelings and actions. She also takes into account both the heavily dedicated die-hard writers, and the &quot;weekend warriors&quot;--something that few writers do. The book is presented in a conversational and friendly tone that makes it easy for you to absorb its lessons.<br />So if you're still debating whether or not to be a writer; if you aren't sure how to handle the emotional rollercoaster that writing can be; or if you're having problems sitting down to write,  this book could help. If you aren't sure what sort of education you need to be a writer; if you don't even know where to start; if you aren't sure how to handle criticism; or you think you've contracted that ill known as &quot;writer's block&quot;--this book might help.

This is a follow-on to &quot;The Writer's Idea Book.&quot; That book was mostly about mining everyday life for ideas, using a plethora of writing prompts. &quot;The Writer's Idea Workshop&quot; takes you to the next step--turning those ideas into saleable writing.<br />While you can find many of the suggestions here in other books on self-editing, you'll also find advice that moves in new directions. There's a section on how to apply other people's suggestions to your own work that talks about the ways in which you can dig through surface-level criticism to get to the really helpful information underneath it. Many of Heffron's prompts in the section &quot;Mining for Diamonds&quot; focus on various ways to look at a piece of writing, pick out what's working and what isn't, and go from there.<br />Do you want help generating ideas? Evaluating your ideas? Making them serve the greater needs of your specific writing projects? What about using them to help you overcome various problems you'll encounter while writing--such as difficult beginnings, stuck middles, and troubled endings? The book follows up its instruction with helpful questions you can ask yourself, and expands on those with prompts and exercises to help you apply what you've learned to a specific piece of writing.<br />This book has a lot more practical information in it than the &quot;idea book&quot;, and it's more versatile. It isn't meant for the seasoned pro, but novice and intermediate writers can learn a lot from it. My only minor gripe is that, in the beginning of the book, Heffron has developed a world-weary tone that focuses not on the wonder of writing, but rather on the mistakes that apprentice writers tend to make over and over again. In some ways this is good--he spends plenty of space on concrete suggestions and prompts meant to help you spot and conquer these issues. On the other hand, it's less inspiring and uplifting than the tone he takes in his previous book.<br />This is a wonderful book that could help most writers to improve their writing. Heffron is such a fixture in the editing world that you'll find his name somewhere in most of the writers' books out there--he really knows what he's doing, and he's sharing that valuable information with us.that could help most writers to improve their writing.

Dr. Maisel doesn't do you the disservice of promising that if you only follow his seven steps everything will be simple and easy. He shows his sample writers stumbling and falling as well as succeeding, and he shows them changing direction, taking their time, and engaging in other realities of the writing process. It is important to him that we understand the realities of the writing process, not that we believe his method is a cure-all.<br />The first step is as easy as quieting your mind and allowing yourself to think. It's also as difficult as quieting your mind. Simple? Yes. Obvious? Yes. But in my experience, it's the obvious things we often miss in life. Maisel presents an exercise called TIPS (Themes, Intention, Plan, Steps) that will help you make your first steps toward actually working on your project, and another exercise that will help you connect theme and intention.<br />Another chapter deals with choices pertaining to marketplace and ethical concerns. Maisel presents arguments on both sides of the issue. Do you aim your work at the marketplace to make more money? Do you stick to your guns and write what you want regardless of whether anyone will want it? Is there a happy middle ground? He gives us the tools we need to decide for ourselves which goal is more important to us.<br />He continues on to discuss more issues of the process of writing, evaluating the work, feeling comfortable with the work, and doing what's necessary. Maisel provides a checklist of requirements writers can meet in order to help themselves, and some brief exercises to help with that goal.<br />&quot;Deep Writing&quot; is not a huge book, but it does pack a pretty good punch. It might not have massive reams of advice to convey, but the simple principles it does present are ones that can make a big difference in your writing. This book does get into a certain amount of touchy-feely psychobabble, but even if you're a bit skeptical of such things (as I tend to be), you might find it useful.

It presents chapters organized alphabetically by garden vegetable. Each chapter includes notes on growing and harvesting the vegetable, yield information, a few nutritional notes, information on storage, freezing, cooking, basic preparation, and complementary herbs. The freezing information is perhaps the most useful, in my mind. The one truly great piece of information I got out of this cookbook is that you *can* freeze and then reheat potato dishes, as long as you don't thaw them first; most cookbooks will just tell you that you can't do this. (However, it doesn't give any instructions as to which sorts of dishes work well for this and which don't--and believe me, some work *much* better than others. Let's just say that if you want to freeze potato dishes, freeze ones in which the potato is in as mashed and creamy a state as possible, with few chunks.)<br />The recipes themselves are all over the map in terms of quality, and lean very heavily on fatty dairy products to make them flavorful--which means that they won't be very useful to vegans or folks on a diet (two major groups of people who are going to want to make heavy use of vegetables in their diet). Most of them also don't use a huge amount of the vegetable in question, and don't state whether they freeze well or not (and if they do, how to alter the cooking instructions for the frozen dish), which means that these recipes aren't any more useful for the cookbook's stated purpose than those in other cookbooks. The only advantage is that in here they're organized by vegetable, and, well, that's what an index is for in other cookbooks. You'd be better off with a copy of the Joy of Cooking--it covers all the vegetables as well, and the recipes are of much more consistent quality.<br />Speaking of the recipes... Some of the recipes have blatant mistakes in them (like the recipe that called for WAY too much salt--our best guess is that it should have called for one *teaspoon* instead of one *tablespoon*). Others just don't taste very good; rarely have I found a cookbook with such incredibly mediocre recipes. Because of the way the recipes are written up, sometimes it's tough to tell which groups of ingredients go with which instructions. Although the recipes look incredibly simple, sometimes that's because they under-explain things or leave out steps, which means that the kind of cook who'll appreciate having simple recipes will probably have problems with them.<br />This book is a great concept, and it saddens me to have to give it such a poor review.

This book is the source of the single-most-baked-cake in my household: the white chocolate whisper cake. Rose Levy Berenbaum shows her genious in this one simple recipe. Not only does the white chocolate add wonderful flavor, but because it melts at a different temperature than butter, it stands up better to icing and cutting while still melting in your mouth! This cookbook is full of such wonderful gems--recipes that produce not good cakes, but *amazing* cakes.<br />This book is aimed at someone with a bit of experience in the kitchen. Pretty much everything is measured by weight, as is normal with professional pastry chefs since it's much more accurate than measuring dry ingredients by volume or eggs by number of eggs. Some of the more complex creations will require experience, an artistic hand, and/or specialized equipment, but even if you don't want to make those, the basic recipes are stupendous. The fruit sauces meant to go with the cakes, for example, make us swoon! Try serving that white chocolate whisper cake, for example, with a raspberry sauce.<br />My one complaint about this cookbook is the icings. Buttercream icings, in my experience, come in three varieties: lots of shortening (blech!), lots of butter, or lots of sugar. I'm really not fond of the lots-of-butter variety, as I find that it unpleasantly masks the flavor of the cake beneath. Unfortunately the buttercream frostings in this cookbook are of the lots-of-butter variety.<br />Do keep in mind that many of the recipes in this cookbook are *not* aimed at beginners. It's a great primer, though, for anyone who wants to make a true exploration into the world of cake-baking!	2004-04-12

Usually I'm a great proponent of doing things from scratch, but there are some good reasons why people might want to use Byrn's recipes that turn cake mixes into... well, cakes, but not quite the cakes you'd get if you just followed the directions on the box.<br />Byrn makes a good case for the benefits of cake mixes. For example, they're made to be very mistake-tolerant. You can mix them too long or not enough, have an oven that's a bit off temperature-wise, or muck up the amount of liquid, and as long as you haven't gone *too* far off you'll still end up with an edible product. More often, anyway, than if you were starting from scratch. Also, while many from-scratch cakes are actually quite simple and easy, some cooks simply feel daunted by them. Starting with cake mixes can feel less like making a real commitment to something. And in some cases, the cake mix version really is easier or quicker or cheaper.<br />Of course I mentioned that these cakes don't come out tasting like cake mix cakes. Ann makes sure to add things to her cake mixes that you won't find on the box. One of these ingredients is usually butter--lots of butter--so these aren't diet recipes. She also adds a dash of something flavorful. Then she combines her cakes with other things, such as the wonderful icing and frosting recipes she includes.<br />There are only a couple of things that keep me from giving this cookbook 5 stars. One is that really, most cake mix cakes aren't that much simpler than starting from scratch--this cookbook is great if you aren't a very good cook and your cakes tend to mysteriously fail, but not so amazing if you know what you're doing. The other is a structural problem. Some of the recipes had odd little structural issues that I've never had with &quot;normal&quot; recipes, like a grainy icing or a &quot;chocolate syrup cake&quot; (syrup baked into the middle of a ring-shaped cake) that simply fell into pieces when we attempted to remove it from the pan.<br />There are handy tips and hints for working with cake mixes and cakes. There's a huge variety of recipes for almost every cake imaginable. The front of the book includes tiny color photos of (I think) all of the recipes. The recipes are uniformly delicious, but they do sometimes have other issues. Buy the cookbook if you need a little help when baking, and make sure to try a recipe ahead of time before making it for company.handy tips and hints for working with cake mixes and cakes.

I was having chocolate cravings, and things had been busy enough lately that I didn't want to pull out Marcel Desaulniers' &quot;death by chocolate&quot; series. So instead, I picked up a copy of &quot;Hershey's Best-Loved Recipes.&quot; I expected them to be fun--but I never expected them to be amazing!<br />First, the ingredients are inexpensive and easy-to-find. I find it's easy to whip up many of these recipes with what's already in the house. If you really want to make sure, just look through the book for pantry ingredients that show up repeatedly (like sweetened condensed milk, toffee bits, or sweetened flaked coconut, as well as chocolate of course) and be sure to have some on hand. The book of course uses brand names, but it's easy enough to extrapolate to your own favorite brands or store brands. These recipes also tend to be inexpensive because they rely so heavily on simple pantry goods like chocolate chips, flour, and oats.<br />What truly amazed me, however, is how reliably these recipes come out. They don't just come out looking nice, or tasting good; they come out perfect every time. It's clear to me that these recipes were very thoroughly kitchen-tested. And beyond that, every single thing we've made so far has tasted so good that we simply couldn't keep it around the house! The oatmeal toffee bars were to-die-for. The butterscotch cheesecake bowled us over. In fact, if you care about your weight, I have this piece of advice for you: before you make any recipe from this book, invite a few friends over! Otherwise you'll almost certainly gain some weight.	2004-04-09

The author talks about working description into our stories. She could have steered us in the direction of pages and pages of static description, yet she doesn't. She could have pushed us in the direction of tired and overused techniques (having the weather too obviously match up with what's going on in the story, for example), yet she didn't. Ms. McClanahan happily points out pitfalls, trite and overused techniques, and things to beware of at all stages. Her exercises back this up, helping us to subvert the expected. She also has a wonderful, quirky sense of humor, and uses her own advice on writing descriptively to turn what could have been a dry textbook into a beautiful and inspiring, fun-to-read book.<br />This book has no large margins. No space-gobbling quotes. No blank space for doing the (very helpful) exercises. No overly large font or ridiculous line-spacing. None of the traditional tricks for making writing books seem larger than they actually are. This book is every bit as thick with useful information as it looks.<br />The range of topics covered in this book in relation to description is phenomenal. I could spend pages listing out the topics covered (and how well they're dealt with!), such as metaphor, &quot;bringing characters to life through description,&quot; point of view, setting, narrative, the senses, and on and on.<br />Whether you write fiction, non-fiction, or poetry, this book can make your writing sing. I have a better notion of where my weaknesses as a writer lie, and how I might turn them into strengths. And that's some of the highest praise I can give to a writing book! This is truly one of my favorite writing books, and it's well worth a writer's time and money to read it.	2004-04-07

But when you start  poking around you find it's so much more complex than you ever imagined--there's unlimited point of view, first-person, inner limited, second-person, outer limited, combo, multiple... and that's just the basics. Scared yet?<br />Point of view was one of those things that I just kind of closed my eyes and prayed about. I'd write a story and trust PoV to take care of itself. Sure, I had a decent sense for it, so usually things worked out okay. But I'm also sure that if I went back now, after having finished this book, I'd find a whole lot of mistakes that I need to fix. And you want to look like a pro who knows what she's doing when you send that story to an editor, right?<br />\\"Mastering Point of View\\" debunks common myths regarding what you can and can't do with PoV. Topics are divided into short sections that are labeled clearly; this makes it easy for you to find information at a moment's notice. Each chapter begins with the basics of its topic. Then it goes into the advantages and disadvantages to using each form of PoV--both to you and to your readers! You'll see examples, get a simple description of things to consider when choosing a PoV, find out about genres and situations each type of PoV is typically used in, and more.<br />\\"Mastering Point of View\\" is a comprehensive, simple, clear treatise on a murky and painful subject. It gets a little repetitive, but I've seen much worse. Every writer owes it to herself to read it at least once.	2004-04-07

It's hard to go wrong with something like Curried Mango-Peanut Yogurt Dip or Carrot-Ginger Salad with Pineapple. The recipes tend toward the exotic and the healthful, including things like Vegetable Barley Soup, Garden Sweet Breakfast Bread, Chinese Dumplings with Chives and Ginger, and Mango Tomatillo Salsa. This book stresses fresh vegetables and salads, and the recipes tend to be fairly light fare in general. You probably won't get a lot of use out of this cookbook if your grocery store doesn't carry good produce; plan these recipes for just after your grocery shopping so that produce is in the best possible condition.<br />There are some ingredients that might be a little difficult to find depending on where you live. I have trouble finding tomatillos, for example. Most ingredients are fairly common, however. The book's layout is fantastic. Commentary is very easy to tell apart from ingredients are very easy to tell apart from instructions, and instructions are nicely numbered.<br />While many of the tastes are a touch exotic, to my taste buds they don't take things far enough sometimes and end up tasting a bit bland. Of course I love strong flavors, so to some people this may be a plus; you can always adjust seasoning to taste if you want more flavor. These recipes are vegetarian but not vegan--you will find dairy and eggs in here.<br />Certainly if you're on a diet this is a fantastic way to serve elegant, impressive dishes that won't pile on the pounds.	2004-04-04

If you're only familiar with Emeril from his TV appearances, this book may surprise you. It lacks the flamboyance and loud flashiness, replacing them with a certain elegance and gourmet style. It includes a Christmas Eve dinner for ten, Emeril's Christmas Day brunch buffet, New Orleans New Year's Eve dinner, a New Year's Day supper family style, the Chef's holiday favorites, and Emeril's &quot;stocking stuffers.&quot;<br /><br />The book is filled  with gorgeous photographs of lavish decorations and settings. They artfully set the mood in this book--one of no expense spared in the interest of fabulous holiday memories. Each section of the book is done as a menu, so that you can make the menu whole or steal individual recipes. None of these menus are quick things, and this book isn't designed for the cook who doesn't like to spend more than a half-hour in the kitchen. Shopping lists are included, as well as wine pairings.<br /><br />This is not the cookbook for someone on a budget: it calls for such expensive ingredients as caviar, truffles, and huge amounts of fresh raspberries, some of which can be tough to find depending on where you live. The book also assumes at least a little experience with basic cooking techniques--novices shouldn't be starting with a gourmet cookbook using expensive ingredients. Not all of the recipes cost so much, however, and they aren't all complicated; for example, the spiced pecans are extremely inexpensive and easy, and they're so good that we've made them more than 15 times at least (and we don't often repeat recipes). They're so good, in fact, that people request them specially when they come to visit at holidays.<br />So try the salad of new potatoes and roasted walnuts with warm bacon vinaigrette, or the truffle risotto with parmesan croutons. Make the andouille cheese bread or the white cheddar truffle eggs. Save this book for an occasion when you really want to pull out all the stops, whether it's Christmas or some other important time in your life.

The fact that this cookbook is so hard to find is nothing short of a sin against gastronomy. I count it among our favorite cookbooks, and when we want to make a show-stopping dessert, this is one of the first cookbooks we turn to.<br />Since there is so much misinformation (or just plain lack of understanding) about white chocolate, this book starts out with some handy information. It includes notes on using white chocolate in baking and foods that pair well with white chocolate (or incorporate it well), instructions on how to successfully melt white chocolate, and some ingredient and equipment notes.<br />Our copy of this book is quite well-used. The white chocolate mousse with blueberry sauce is nothing short of astounding, but oh, this is NOT diet food! The orange white chocolate mousse isn't far behind in quality, and the vanilla white chocolate mousse will make you swoon. If mousses aren't impressive enough, how about white chocolate dumplings in strawberry soup? (We thought we'd died and gone to heaven!) Or a white chocolate Bavarian cream or white chocolate terrine. And that's only part of the first chapter of recipes!<br />Chapters include cakes, cheesecakes, and tortes; pies, pastries, and breads; souffles, puddings, and crepes; ice cream, frozen desserts, and beverages; and much more! Who could resist strawberry shortcake with white chocolate chantilly, Clay's chocolate ice cream with white chocolate truffles, or white chocolate-ginger truffles?<br />But if you really want your guests to come back over and over again, trust me when I tell you to make the white chocolate cheesecake with dark chocolate crust. When we lived in Boston and did yearly Thanksgiving feasts, at least 2 or 3 people would request that specific recipe every year!<br />These are fancy dishes, to be sure, but many of them are also pretty simple and well-explained. I won't tell you this book is for beginners, but you also don't need to be an expert. You'll certainly look like one, though, when you put one of these desserts in front of your guests!, when you put one of these desserts in front of your guests!	2004-04-04

Surprisingly, it isn't that tough after all! &quot;Chinese Dim Sum&quot; is one of the two most authentic of the dim sum cookbooks we've gotten. The recipes are written in both Chinese and English (side-by-side). Many use ingredients that people may have a hard time finding (such as leaf lard and red bean paste--some you can buy on line). The recipes are generally short, and laid out simply. Instructions are brief and numbered, and often accompanied by photos that show the processes involved. There are also gorgeous photos of finished recipes, showcasing ways in which you can make these dishes remarkably attractive and elegant.<br />I occasionally had difficulties with measurements. For example, in the recipe for red bean paste buns, some items are listed in tablespoons or teaspoons in the English version, but yeast was given in grams. Although we have a very good kitchen scale, it measures in 5-gram increments, so we had to guess when it came to measuring out 11 grams of yeast. Most items are given in both grams and ounces, but many kitchen scales can't measure, for example, 1/3 of an ounce. You're best off if you have a very accurate kitchen scale that measures grams, or at least enough experience in the kitchen to feel comfortable approximating.<br />These are fantastic recipes. Every single one we've made has been delightful. The red bean paste buns we made from this book were every bit as good as the ones I've had in restaurants, if not more so. The coconut buns were stunning as well, and the pork-filled pastries were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. (Their method of making the pastry dough is also surprisingly simple and non-difficult compared to some that I've tried.)<br />If you're willing to search around for ingredients (or have the right sort of store nearby) and you're interested in trying some truly authentic dim sum, I highly recommend this cookbook. The recipes are fabulous, and with a very sensitive kitchen scale the last few reservations I have would melt away.sitive kitchen scale the last few reservations I have would melt away.	2004-04-04

She also has a great sense of irony and humor. These traits make this one of the most enjoyable and accessible writing books I've ever read.<br />\\"Dynamic Characters\\" covers a lot of ground. I was surprised to find so much information on dialogue in here, for example. We can't chisel a character out of the work of fiction it's found in and deal with it as a separate entity; character is intimately tied to the rest of a story. Even while we're writing dialogue, setting, and and plot we should be thinking about how it impacts (and is impacted by) our characters. The author presents a million and one different ways to delve into, think about, and develop wonderful characters.<br /><br />Ms. Kress tells us what the pitfalls are of various techniques, what risks we're taking, why different things are considered trite or overused (and what we might try to make them fresh again), as well as why we still might want to try some methods in certain circumstances. She tells us how as well as why, so that we can make our own informed decisions.<br />She's very good about putting her suggestions within the context of all sorts of types of writing: literary fiction, mysteries, romances, science fiction, fantasy, and so on. She uses numerous published examples from sources as disparate as Dickens and Stephen King. This book treats its subject matter extremely thoroughly, is inspiring and enjoyable, and could greatly improve your fiction. The only flaw I found is that it makes other writing books look so much less effective and interesting by comparison.<br />What are you waiting for? If your fiction could use even the smallest boost, then read Dynamic Characters.<br />...	2004-03-26

There's a ton of useful information in here: Archetypes, inner and outer goals, personal transformations, self-esteem, private and public selves, desperation, dysfunctional families, mental disorders, and much more. The material is accessible to a layman, but still useful to someone who already has an interest in psychology.<br /><br />The exercises push you to delve into aspects of your own memories, emotions, and personality that you might not be comfortable with; the author believes that you can't create realistic characters that feel the wide range of human emotions if you don't even know what those emotions feel like yourself. But this isn't an approach that everyone is going to want to take, and some people may have good reasons for avoiding it. Just be aware of this aspect of \\"Breathing Life into Your Characters\\", and be sure that you're willing to go there if you decide to buy this book--the exercises are a serious part of the material, not a glued-on after-thought.<br />I do have a few minor problems with this book:<br />1. In the first half of the book there's a LOT of repetition of concepts--it gets old pretty fast.<br />2. Ms. Ballon stresses the value of exploring memories and releasing our emotions, with few if any caveats about this process. I think this is a little careless. There are circumstances under which exploring traumatic memories without the supervision of a trained therapist can do more harm than good, and I think she should have mentioned this--particularly since she herself is a psychotherapist.<br />3. For everyone who sees an issue one way, you're bound to find someone who sees it a different way. This is particularly true when talking about what constitutes a good story. Thus, the various phrases like \\"in any good story\\" and \\"in all good writing\\" that litter parts of this book seriously pushed my Pet Peeve Button--even when I agreed with them.<br />For all my complaints about the presentation issues, they're just that--presentation issues. They're annoyances that plenty of readers won't share. When it comes down to it, this is a very useful book that is almost certain to benefit your fiction-writing as much as it did mine. And so, while the annoyed part of me is tempted to give this book three stars, the more objective part of me impels me to give it four. It produced impressive results, and that's the true test of a writing book.Pet Peeve Button--even when I agreed with them.<br />For all my complaints about the presentation issues, they're just that--presentation issues.

It's at once sobering and hopeful; it doesn't get you worked up with a lot of false hopes, yet doesn't leave you depressed and suicidal about your chances of getting published either.<br />This book debunks popular myths and legends about writing. It covers the varieties of science fiction, as well as fantasy, including &quot;dark fantasy&quot; or horror. It briefly touches on fans and conventions, including how to handle your fans (the good and the bad). It discusses the importance (or not) of having &quot;new&quot; ideas for your stories, and of knowing your subject. It'll also point out some of the mistakes and problems that knowing your subject can push you into.<br />It goes into writing as a job. It covers the usual &quot;you have to make time for it&quot; idea that every book trots out, but it also provides useful suggestions for how to go about this. It goes over the good and bad methods SF authors use to convey information in their stories. Instead of simply trotting out the old &quot;show don't tell&quot; advice, it provides practical structuring suggestions, as well as examples of those suggestions. It also goes into such genre topics as world-building.<br />One of the invaluable aspects of this part of the book is the insider's perspective. These authors haven't just summed up their own experiences submitting things--they've talked to lots of editors and networked with everyone. They tell you what editors like, don't like, and dread.<br />This book gives practical advice on self-promotion, without pushing you to use the sleazy, shady, or just plain rude self-promotion practices I've seen advocated in many articles. You'll find all sorts of tips in here on readings and signings, conventions, cards and fliers, press releases, interviews, reviews, and book launches. The book even covers web sites, newsgroups and netiquette, mailing lists and awards. There's also a section on agents, electronic rights and publishing, contracts, taxes, and writers' associations.<br />This is an immensely practical book for genre authors, and well worth reading several times over.

He discusses everything, from relationships of all kinds to the definition of a writing &quot;career,&quot; your education, your craft, drug addictions, your personality, your challenges, your strengths, and so on. Finally he ends up with the &quot;nine Cs,&quot; a framework for thinking about the various issues you face.<br /><br />He doesn't have solutions for everything (and doesn't pretend to), but he does have some ideas to get you started. He helps you to see where the problems are, which alone can make a difference. Even if you don't think you have big problems this book can still be useful; it puts a lot of things in perspective.<br /><br />Maisel has several goals for this book. One is to help writers who have problems. Another is to let would-be writers know the stark truths about the industry they're thinking of entering. Yet another is to help people who have trouble sitting down to write--whether they're veterans suffering from burnout or psychological blocks, or would-be writers who haven't written a single word yet.<br /><br />Read this before deciding to become a writer! More potential writers should know what they're getting themselves into up front. Also read this if you're a writer and your life is anything less than perfect--like me, you might find that it helps in surprising ways. While there is some stuff in here about &quot;affirmations&quot; and other psychological pep-talk that some people might shy away from, it's a solidly practical book that anyone could benefit from.	2004-03-25

The book is filled with various strips lampooning all sorts of aspects of writing, and tiny snippets of advice from famous authors.<br />The strips in this book are so funny that I had to share many of them with my husband as I read. Particularly all the ones that have within them some variation of the line: &quot;It was a dark and stormy night.&quot; Snoopy seemed fixated on that idea, unable to get past it to anything more original than &quot;it was a dark and stormy noon,&quot; or perhaps, &quot;he was a dark and stormy knight.&quot;<br /><br />And in between all of these stormy nights we get to see Snoopy's clashes with editors and publishers of all kinds: &quot;Dear Contributor, We are returning your dumb story. Note that we have not included our return address. We have moved to a new office, and we don't want you to know where we are.&quot; Ouch! All writers can identify with some part of the poor beagle's struggles for fame, recognition, and a fifty thousand dollar check!<br /><br />I was a bit surprised to find out just how short most of these little essays are--a few paragraphs, generally. On the other hand, it meant there was more room for comic strips, so how can I complain? This book isn't meant to be an exhaustive textbook or guide to the writing life. It's a joyful riff on the pain, excitement, and perspiration that is writing. You're bound to find something in here by a writer you love, and it's neat just to see what these preeminent folks have to say. Each essay is preceded by a related comic strip, and many of the essays address Snoopy or one of his friends directly, or mention poor Snoopy's latest plight--it's an endearing conceit. Each is then followed by several more strips just to keep us laughing.<br />This is a wonderful coffee table book. It's a great gift for your favorite struggling, would-be, or even successful writer. All of us can relate to Snoopy's trials and tribulations. All of us can enjoy seeing these brief words of wisdom from such accomplished authors. And all of us could use a good laugh at ourselves and the &quot;hardships&quot; we endure in the writing life!rite struggling, would-be, or even successful writer.

If you cut to the back of the book, you find that &quot;some of this text was also used as part of [the author's] doctoral dissertation.&quot; Many dissertations are written in a thick academic language that hardly lends itself to a &quot;simple creative writing classroom scenario,&quot; which is what the book bills itself as.<br />If there's a sin against writing, it is probably committed somewhere in this book.  Parenthetical etymological notes appear too liberally throughout. The author throws out references and comments without any context. The text consists largely of quotes with a few of the author's own thoughts used to string them together--I'm unconvinced that there's anything new in this book. Of course, the quotes are both the saving grace of this book and its downfall. While they cause one to eventually realize that there is very little substance to the book, they are what give the book its only grace-notes.<br />The author talks about mystery, excitement, enthusiasm, and wonder being central to creativity. I agree with that thesis, so I had trouble understanding why I disliked her approach to the topic so much. Then I realized that the academic style of writing robs her words of exactly the emotions she was trying to express.<br />There are comments in this book that make no logical sense (I've shown them to a handful of people--no one could guess what they were supposed to mean); maybe they made sense in a missing context. The author also makes some fairly contradictory statements. She insists that science and technology require inspiration and creativity to get anywhere, and yet says that the more cognitive society gets, the less creative it gets. She says at one point, &quot;Unlike animals, man had a brain...&quot; Animals don't have brains?! And you can add to this list a bunch of mistakes that make it look as though she had no editor--a page on which she repeats the same quote twice in two paragraphs; etymological notes and quotes that repeat on different pages; not to mention a whole bunch of incorrect or missing punctuation marks.<br />I cannot recommend this book unless you have a real love of thick, quote-heavy rambling. It starts out with a wonderful premise, and I wish I could say that it does anything good with that premise. But alas, the only real value this book has is as a collection of cool quotes--which you can find elsewhere.repeats the same quote twice in two paragraphs; etymological notes and quotes that repeat on different pages; not to mention a whole bunch of incorrect or missing punctuation marks. <br />I cannot recommend this book unless you have a real love of thick, quote-heavy rambling.

US	32860001	R6P1OODPQ1ZBJ	1580081606	813118427	The Writer's Path: A Guidebook for Your Creative Journey : Exercises, Essays, and Examples	Books	5	3	3	N	N	My Path	The majority of &quot;The Writer's Path&quot; consists of exercises and examples, tied together by bits of wisdom, suggestions, and experiences the authors have had. There are plenty of suggestions for using these exercises in partner, class, or group writing, which makes them much more widely applicable than most other books. Also, when I read other books I often shrug at many of the exercises, finding them a little less than inspiring. Most of this book's exercises come with variations, suggested places to start, ways to take them further, and so on, and I found them more interesting.<br /><br />The exercises range from &quot;jump starts&quot; (quick little things) to &quot;letter forms&quot; (exercises you can do with postcards and letters), &quot;style&quot; (exercises to help you work on your voice and style), &quot;character&quot; (things like biography data sheets, character explorations), and more. If you only read one chapter from this book, though, read the &quot;story&quot; chapter. The exercises in random story structures, abstract story structures, natural story structures, poetic outlines, and so on are intriguing, fun, and inspiring.<br /><br />The examples are my only quibble with the book. They take up a lot of space, and I wasn't terribly interested in them. I do think they serve one important purpose, however. The writer who is afraid to just cut loose and allow herself to write something silly or even--heaven forfend--bad can see that it's okay to not write masterpieces here, and that can be fairly liberating.<br />This would be a particularly valuable book for writing teachers, I believe. The authors have done quite a bit of teaching, and they share many of the insights they've learned. So whether you're teaching creative writing to high schoolers or some of your adult neighbors, in a classroom setting or an informal writers' group, you could learn a lot from this book.	2004-03-24

It takes a deliberately silly tone, designed to get the reader to loosen up and let go, try new things, and take off in new directions.<br />Mari Messer delves into &quot;hurry sickness&quot;, the psychology of &quot;devoted attention&quot;, the relationship between our creative and logical minds, playing, collecting useless information, visualization, &quot;practice without purpose&quot;, taming your inner critic, and facing the giant squid of confusion(!).<br />All sorts of things are expressed in terms of weird, extensive, ongoing metaphors; this gives us an idea of just how creative and weird you can get if you try. It does get a little ridiculous (I suspect deliberately so), which might tweak your sensibilities a little if your inner critic is raging. (But then, perhaps that's the point.)<br /><br />Ms. Messer is honest about some of these lessons being not only tough to learn, but difficult to remember. She isn't shy about explaining the times when she's fallen down. She uses interesting examples from her life, her students' lives, and famous people's lives. These make the principles she discusses come alive.<br />I've learned a lot in here that's been directly applicable to how I live my life, how I work, specific projects I'm working on, how I deal with people, how I let other people deal with me, and so on. The discussion of criticism, constructive criticism, and their place in the creative process has convinced me to be less harsh and critical in my judgment of others' work. Criticism does have a crucial role to play in creative work, but it's also important to be careful not to apply it too early.<br />Before I read this book I had forgotten what it was like to have so many ideas for material to write that I constantly had to carry a notebook around with me to catch even a fraction of them. I got halfway through this book and I had to make a trip to the drug store to pick up some pocket-sized notebooks to catch the sheer flood of ideas! It's hard to give the book a more glowing recommendation than that.up some pocket-sized notebooks to catch the sheer flood of ideas!

It has an odd black-and-olive color scheme that I actually came to love after a while. Black and white photos are scattered throughout, and they're quite well reproduced. Suggestions are presented sideways, right-side-up, at an angle, on (reproduced) tacked-up notes, luggage tags, and index cards.<br /><br />There are suggestions and exercises. Sentences with blanks to fill in. Ruminations on elements of writing. Little horoscopes you can apply to your characters. Quotes from writers that don't duplicate the quotes I've seen in all the other writing books! (Monica Wood promised this would be the case in the introduction, and to be honest I didn't believe her. I do now.)<br /><br />There's fire and enthusiasm, and a deep understanding of the writing life and what it takes to not only survive it, but enjoy and thrive in it. Her &quot;ten commandments for a happy writing life&quot; and her recommendations for handling rejections are spot-on.<br /><br />I have not a single complaint about this book, except perhaps that I'd like to take every single page and put it on a card in a deck. Then on any given day I could shuffle the deck and draw a card or two.<br /><br />There are a lot of things in writing books that bug me--bits of advice I don't agree with. Condescending attitudes toward new &amp; developing writers that annoy me. Ways of approaching things that, really, everyone else has already done a hundred times over. Instead, in &quot;The Pocket Muse&quot; you'll just find lots of fun, bushels of inspiration, and plenty of things to think about!	2004-03-24

Because of their length, Gerrold doesn't get into much depth. However, he does touch on many interesting subjects: Wonder, \\"what if?\\", what makes science fiction science fiction and fantasy fantasy, crises and challenges, world-building, alien-building, believability, transformation, theme, style, sex scenes and love scenes, simile and metaphor, evocation, metric prose, memes, point of view and perspective, tense, pronouns, dialogue, specificity, and more.<br /><br />Gerrold possesses a lively, engaging style; wit, humor, and personality abound. The book feels more like a conversation than a set of lessons.  Gerrold has had the opportunity to speak with many of the SF giants of our day, and he passes on tales of how and why various authors have done things in certain ways. You come away from the book with a good understanding of the vast possibilities available to you when you write, and the many different things you can play with to take control of your work.<br /><br />Gerrold does explain some things as inherent to the genre that I don't think are always the case; in some places I think his advice applies more narrowly (to certain parts of the genre) than he indicates. I think some sections should have gone into more depth; others should have been left out if they were going to be covered so lightly. But this book succeeds in some very specific and delightful ways, offering things that I haven't seen anywhere else--Gerrold has some very interesting points to make about the power of language and how writers use it (and fail to use it).	2004-03-24

Word associations, letting things percolate through your mind, honestly editing your work... Bradbury couches everything in examples from his own life and work. He loads everything up with context. Perhaps most importantly, he lends his words a vibrancy, a poetry, a life that speaks far louder than any dry essay on writing ever could!<br /><br />He talks of love and hate, and how emotions drive good writing. He speaks of work and relaxation, and how both are necessary at once. All of this in beautiful, easy-to-read language that you can easily cruise through in a day.<br /><br />It's hard not to come away from this book without a sense of this man: a whimsical, driven, fire-breathing soul of wit and humor and great understanding. I normally have little interest at all in meeting famous people, but I wish that I could meet Mr. Bradbury. Certainly his work has inspired many a dreamer, and all writers of the fantastic owe him and his work a great debt.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this writing book highly enough. If you're looking for dry suggestions to help you get published look elsewhere, but if you're looking for inspiration, this is the place to find it. The passion, energy, and enthusiasm that flow through the words are contagious. I cannot imagine a single author that could not be improved by reading this book.	2004-03-24

It's organized by days, and each day starts with an exercise. This is followed by a section that briefly asks you questions about what you wrote. Following this comes a longer bit in which one of the two authors (Bruce Ballenger or Barry Lane--they initial these passages) discusses the exercise and its related principles at length.<br />Often the author will take the opportunity to share his own exercise results, complete with commentary on what works and what doesn't, why, and what the author got out of the exercise.<br />This book is primarily designed for those people who don't really call themselves writers yet. It's for people who aren't sure of what they're doing or how to go about getting started. If you haven't written professionally yet, if you still sit around wondering what you should do when confronted with a blank page, this could be the perfect book for you.<br />One of the better aspects of this book is the very personal voice it's written in. Usually co-authored books are written in a neutral voice in order to avoid noticeable differences between each author's work; in this case each author is allowed to retain his voice. Sometimes one or the other will even discuss his reactions to one of the other author's exercises. This very personal viewpoint is often exactly what's needed to convey the real lessons Ballenger and Lane are trying to teach. It also makes the material more interesting, and gives you the feeling that you really are sitting in a small classroom with an interesting and enthusiastic teacher.<br /><br />Ballenger and Lane are teachers as well as writers, and it shows--in a good way. They neither kill your enthusiasm with criticism nor promise that evaluation and revision don't matter. They use their own experiences to show the ups and downs of being a writer, and the lessons to be learned therein.<br /><br />To be honest, I really couldn't find any problem with this book.
