(Perhaps helped by effective espionage?)  There's also a bit of information on ICBMs in France and China, the only other two countries with these very long-range missiles.  Easy to read and a page turner, the book contains a lot of fascinating details about how ICBMs work and the people behind their development.  It's a must-read for anyone interested in ICBMs and their interesting history.	2005-08-27

I *am* a believer in the importance of lowering your bad cholesterol, but I think the way to do it is to talk to your doctor (hopefully you have a good doctor) who can monitor your progress and guide you through the process.  This book has some \\"common sense\\" information but also a lot if misinformation, such as the stuff on supplements.  None of them has been shown to really work!  Don't waste your money.

This book focuses on linear models related to ANOVA and hence may have a good audience in disciplines such as statistics, biostatistics, etc, but it has ABSOLUTELY nothing useful for people interested in econometrics or financial statistics.<br /><br />For example, the book doesn't even mention heteroskedasticity at all, and there's absolutely no time series coverage.  In econometrics we also do weighted regressions a lot, and this book doesn't have anything.<br /><br />I wish the book title had been more descriptive.  Linear models are many stripes and used in many different disciplines.  By using such a catch-call title, the book is misleading.<br /><br />So, if you want to do linear models in economics or finance, do NOT buy this book.	2005-06-09

If you want to become a true expert at using Outlook, or plan to deploy and manage Outlook at your enterprise, or have to take some MS Office certification exams in order to advance your career, you'll find this book immensely useful.  In fact, this is simply the best advanced treatment of Outlook 2003, bar none.<br /><br />Ok, I say this partly because I'm a fan of the Inside Out series, which is not only informative and helpful for those who want to master Microsoft's increasingly monstrously complicated software, but also highly accurate and authoritative.  These latter features are very important and beneficial to the reader.  \\"Inside Out\\" books don't claim to give you \\"inside secrets\\" or \\"Easter eggs\\" or \\"undocumented tweaks\\" -- even though they do offer such gems here and there -- instead they focus in giving you every iota of detail you'll need in order to power-use and troubleshoot each program.<br /><br />\\"Outlook 2003 Inside Out\\" continues this well-written, well-edited tradition of the series.  It's thick and heavy at over 1,000 pages -- with another 100 \\"bonus\\" pages on Visual Basic and other topics on the accompanying CD-ROM, in addition to the complete e-book itself -- but it's quite easy to navigate thanks to a well thought-out organization.  Almost no stone is left unturned in the coverage of Outlook 2003's vast amount of features (but I'm sure there are minute details that even a book this size and scope has left out), and each feature is treated in great detail, sometimes to the point of overwhelming.  Thankfully, lots of screenshots grace the pages to illustrate various dialog boxes.  Throughout the book you'll also find lots of genuinely useful tips, set apart from the main text in boxes and a different font.<br /><br />I don't meant to sound pretentious, but this book is not a good one for newcomers to Outlook.  Its coverage and content will simply overwhelm someone not already familiar with the basics of Outlook 2003.  A better guide for beginners is the excellent \\"Microsoft Office 2003 Inside Out\\" which introduces all the programs in the Office 2003 suite.  While that book is by no means a prerequisite for reading the present volume -- many other books will do, or just explore Outlook on your own the way genuine geeks do without reading a manual -- it gives the reader enough grounding in Outlook fundamentals that he'll find migrating to this present book a joy in his journey to conquering the beast of Outlook 2003.t font. <br /> <br />I don't meant to sound pretentious, but this book is not a good one for newcomers to Outlook.

It's a terrific text because it has both theory and applications (with emphasis on the former, though).  The best thing about it at the time of its publication was it was very complete, covering almost everything that was known in econometrics at the time.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book was never updated, and now nobody uses it; instead, people use the poorly written one by William Greene, which contributes to the poor education in grad-level econometrics these days.  (Have you noticed that today's econometrics students, even the Ph.D. ones and even some assistant professors, don't even understand the relationship between R-squared and t-statistic?  I get asked \\"why am I getting super-high t-statistics while my R^2 is so low?\\" all the time.  If they had read Judge et al., they would have known the answer.)<br /><br />Even though I loved this book in teh early 90s, I cannot recommend it as a reference book because it is pretty much out of date.  Sure, most of the basic stuff (OLS, 2SLS, limited dependent, etc.) is the same, but people who buy a thick book like this want an up-to-date volume, and this book unfortunately does not fit the bill.  It's so sad that such a comprehensive and well-written volume has totally languished into obscurity.	2005-04-01

If you are someone who's very new to programming, OOP may be a little over your head -- I don't mean to sound rude, but even for a seasoned programmer like myself (with 15 years of experience in everything from C to Fortran to VB to Perl to Matlab), OOP is always a hard to grasp concept, and I still program in a non-OOP way.  (That's why I never quite adopted Java.)  In that case, you should start with a C book.<br /><br />But if you must learn OOP, or Java, this book will serve you well.  It tries to be gentile in its treatment of computer programming concepts, and presents plenty of Java code to illustrate the various points.  I find the important thing about using this book is, you gotta do the exercises, and don't be lazy.  OOP is really a complex concept, so lots of sweat and swears are just part of becoming proficient at it.  This book helped me understand Java and OOP better, although I will probably never adopt the OOP paradigm of programming.  For me, C and Perl (and VB in Windows) do all the tricks I need.	2005-03-18

While the book promises a lot -- \\"set up your own wi-fi!\\" and \\"take your laptop to the beach!\\" -- it falls short in delivering useful guidance.

Instead, it has 100 usage tips of highly dubious usefulness to the typcical PE3 user, presented in no particular order.  The biggest problem of this book is how cluttered and busy visually each page is.  Even when the tip deals with a non-graphical topic like increasing the amount of RAM PE3 uses, the page is littered with background graphics, and you can barely see the relevant dialog box screen shot.  Flipping through the book you'll likely get a headache from the circus of numbers and circles that dance on the pages like little red monsters.  This book is a total visual disaster.

Published last summer, it's already out-of-date.  But that's not its true vice; the problem is 1) it has a lot of factual errors, and 2) it doesn't give you critical comparisons you need to choose among the products in each category.<br /><br />The book is broken into sections by the different PC components: mobo, CPU, hard drive, etc.  Each section begins with some general information which is too simple for power users yet too difficult-to-understand for beginners.  If you fall in the middle, you would have found this useful, except the author keeps saying everything is great and dandy, so you end up not knowing which technology or brand you should pick.  An author who's more critical and opinionated would have been more helpful.<br /><br />For example, between Intel and AMD CPUs, and among the many different models, which one should you buy?  There are 12 pages on processors, but the section reads like a typical magazine article that says \\"model A has features 1-2-3, model B has features 7-8-9, but the higher numbers are not necessarily better than the lower ones, except if you are willing to overclock, which BTW may void your warranty, if not causing your PC to explode if not done properly, but you should really do it because the manufacturer says it's okay as long as you do it right, which BTW BTW is not possible if you didn't buy and read the last 20 issues of our magazine.\\"  You get my point.<br /><br />One more critical point from this reviewer: when a book like this recommends specific products, you are never sure if these products are truly the best in their respective categories, or they are here only because the manufacturers pay the author or publisher or both some kind of kickbacks.  One thing I learned working in different industries in the past is how corrupt private businesses are, despite our country's having the best legal system in the world.  Kickbacks and \\"soft money\\" are just everywhere.  Anyway, many products in this book are of dubious usefulness or quality, and there are certain better products out there, so one must be skeptical about the author's picks, esp. when he works for a magazine and publishing company that relies entirely on advertising dollars for profits.

There was so much juicy information on Nikon products in this hardcover that I simply did not know where to start.  Ok, the first Nikon I used was an FM2, so I flipped to page 60 and found lots of cool information from background to features to versions to pictures of the FM2.  Then I jumped to the page on the N50 (F50 outside of North America), a consumer-oriented SLR that was the first SLR I bought.  Here, I found so much information on the N50 that I wished I had read this when I was still using that camera.  Next stop was the D70, which I currently own.  Yes, this book is very up-to-date (as of end of 2004), and covers all current d-SLR models in Nikon's lineup.<br /><br />There's also tons of information on the Nikkor lenses, the Speedlight flashes, the Coolpix digital camera line (but the latest model, Coolpix 8800, is not included), plus accessories.  I don't know if this covers 100% of what Nikon has produced, but that doesn't matter.  The book covers all the Nikon products that mattered in the history of cameras, and there's plenty of info on currently sold products.  There's even a section on the new Coolwalker portable hard drive from Nikon, which the author cautions against buying since you don't want to \\"put all your eggs in one basket\\" should the hard disk fail.<br /><br />Anyway, this book is not about photography at all, and nobody is going to become a better photographer upon reading this.  The book also doesn't review the specific pros and cons of each product; it's more about specs and features.  It's geared toward Nikon collectors, but also normal Nikon owners who want to know Nikon's history and product lines.  It's esp. valuable when you want to buy something used.  With this book in hand, you can find out what the equipment does or doesn't do, and whether there were better versions before or after its introduction.  This is not a pricing guide, but it arms you with enough knowledge to make a meaningful, reasonable bid according to your needs.<br /><br />The book's inside cover note says it's not sponsored by Nikon.n you want to buy something used.

But as I sat down by the caf&eacute; and started reading the book, I was so glad that I hadn't just bought it out of sheer excitement.<br /><br />I have two major issues with this book: first and foremost, the pictures in the book are just not good. I'm sorry maybe I don't have the proper \\"artistic\\" eye, but the pictures in this book look poor-quality and *plain and boring* to me.  Many of them are amateurish-looking (the picture on p.86 looks just like one taken by my 8-year-old niece!), while others are blurry or have barely visible subject matters (e.g., pp.6-7 and p.92, among many others).  If you are thinking of buying this book, I recommend you flip through it first (esp. chapter one \\"Professional Portfolios\\") to see if you agree with the author's artistic taste or not. For me, these are exactly the pictures I don't want to take. As a photographer, I want to take night photos that are pleasing to look at and don't strain the audience's eyes or make them nauseous.<br /><br />Second, which is an issue particular to my needs, this book is almost all about film photography. A lot of attention is devoted to selecting the different film types.  If you are a film shooter, chapter 3 could be of value to you.  For digital shooters, you'll only find four pages of superficial coverage (e.g., \\"how a digital camera works\\").<br /><br />The saving grace of the book is chapter 4, which gives the reader a few specific assignments along with advice on how to look for things to photograph as well as how to meter properly or how to work with depth of field. As I read through the assignments I found them quite interesting, so I jotted down two or three of them which I thought would be worth doing. For me, the book would have been worth buying if the author had expanded on the materials in this chapter and made the book more instructional rather than showcasing \\"inspirational portfolios\\" (from the back cover) that don't necessarily inspire the reader.<br /><br />Of course, given that I'm not, nor will I ever be, a professional artist, let alone a successful one, my harsh criticism of the book only reflects my learning needs as an amateur photographer. I know I like photos that are sharp-looking with an easy-to-understand vision or message, whether it's a shot of the Eifel Tower against a moon-lit night sky or a picture of tulips in the suburbs of Amsterdam. You may be the type of artistic person who appreciates the \\"vision\\" in this book. In that case, you may like this book.jotted down two or three of them which I thought would be worth doing.

It's best suited for the serious amateur who already has some basic concepts but wishes to gain more advanced knowledge.  Topics that are often treated lightly in other books, such depth of field, manual focusing, choosing and buying accessories, and more, are covered in detail here.  Take a look at the table of contents (available here on Amazon) and you'll see the wide range of topics this 650-page book covers.<br /><br />The book has an old-timer feel to it, both because it's printed on regular paper using some ancient font and because almost all pictures are b&w.  The focus is also heavily on film photography.  There's a separate chapter in the current edition (5th) that deals with digital photography, unfortunately it's neither duly updated (they still tell you about 1MP digital cameras and SmartMedia cards) nor very accurate nor comprehensive.<br /><br />If you want a one-stop book on photography, you may not be able to find one.  No book I know of (including Manual of Photography and a few Hedgecoe books) gives you *everything* on photography.  Manual of Photography probably comes closest but it's also hard to read.  The reason I bought Grimm's book is it's cheap, it's easy to read, and it covers a lot of things that are too \\"old\\" to be covered in other books.

I can understand if someone already has an advanced grasp of lighting techniques they can benefit from seeing how other pros light their shots.  This book is basicaly just a collection of some photographers' photos.  Each photo is accompanied by the lighting setup and occasionally the photographer's comment.  But to my eyes, the pictures are not really that good; all too often I disagree with the lighting effects.  Then thre's the lack of detailed instructions that I was looking for.  I mean, I was hoping to find detailed tips on how to soften a portrait to the right amount, or how to bring out the smoothest skin tones in a glamour shot.  Some of the information is buried in the comments, but even then it's not deep or clear enough to me to a low-IQ person like myself.  If you are looking for a book that teaches you the ABC and XYZ of shooting great portraits, this is not it.  (I'm still looking for a good book; if you have a suggestion, please e-mail me at hotmail.)	2005-01-21

(Of course, don't just let it sit there; read it!)  I think the emphasis here is it's useful only for the *serious* Perl person, as it contains lots of in-depth discussion on the nitty-gritty details of Perl's idiosyncratic personalities.<br /><br />The reason I don't like the book as much as I thought I would is things are not explained clearly much of the time.  Take the chapter on references for example.  While the authors include lots of examples, the explanation of how nested references work is just confusing.  Granted, this is a nasty concept to grasp, but I expected something clearer.  Instead they just say \\"oh this looks ugly\\", which is not helpful.  BTW, if you are pulling your hair out over references like I am, the Dumper pragma (not the dump function) is extremely helpful.  (Unfortunately, it's not mentioned in this book, nor in the camel book).	2004-12-30

The topics are covered more logically and explanations of the features are given more clearly.  You also get a few sample photos (e.g., fill-in flash, multiple-flash) that give you an idea about what some of the features may do to your photographic work.<br /><br />But beyond rehashing what's already covered in the manual -- and replicating exactly the same tables -- the book doesn't offer any practical advice.  For instance, how exactly should we use the i-TTL flash to improve flash photography?  What metering system *really* works?  What settings can improve the image quality of my pictures?  These are not explained at all.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good D70 guide with practical advice, check out Thom Hogan's self-published e-book \\"Complete Guide to the Nikon D70,\\" on his website bythom.com.  (I'm not affiliated with Hogan or his website in any way.)  Hogan's e-book is more expensive but also much more extensive, and he gives you concrete recommendations you can use (e.g., set sharpening to none, now!).  Hogan's book is about 3.5 stars; if he had written and/or edited better and included a few real-world sample photos, I'd rate it 4 or 4.5.  In any case, that e-book is better than this Magic Lantern guide.	2004-12-29

It's the typical Adobe \\"classroom in a book\\" format, with lots of handholding, and is generally easy to follow.  The sacrifice is lack of advanced techniques, but, hey, you gotta learn to walk before you can run, right?<br /><br />I, too, think Scott Kelby's book is also good.  I find this book (classroom in a book) easier to understand and follow, as Kelby has a habit of skipping important information and leaving you wondering \\"why am I doing this in the first place?\\"  But if you want an easy techniques reference rather than a tutorial-oriented book, consider the Kelby volume.<br /><br />As a Windows user, I'm very happy that this book is for the Windows version.  Macintrash users should just switch to Windows to enjoy the freedom to choose and the assurance that Adobe will keep supporting Windows applications forever (and to be free from Apple's \\"our users don't need or deserve tech support\\" arrogance).	2004-12-28

The author discusses both formats in detail and offers *real-world* advice (hint: he's a middle-of-the-roader)<br /><br />- what should I do with the exposure histogram?  Finally, this book offers the most detailed and helpful information I've seen regarding histograms.  Lots of real-world examples are given to show you how to interpret the histogram depending on the shooting situation.  If you thought you should always try to get \\"twin peaks\\" in the histogram for the \\"correct\\" exposure, you'd better pick up this book and I'm sure you'll benefit tremendously.  Plus general exposure tips, too.<br /><br />- with my expensive d-SLR, how should I conduct myself out in the field?  The author covers what to bring and what not to bring, etc.<br /><br />- plus other stuff which is more general but presented in an easy-to-understand format, e.g., digital photography basics, digital darkroom general guidelines, etc.<br /><br />Of course, if you are already a master photographer like our world-famous guy from Norway, you really don't need this book.  In fact you don't need any book since you are already a master.  Rouse's book is really for those of us who are just amateurs but would like to either improve their photo skills or turn pro someday.  This book is not about manipulating images in Photoshop or PhotoImpact; it's about getting the most out of your d-SLR.  This is also not a book about photography (or even digital photography) in general, but about getting the most out of your d-SLR.

It puzzles me why this book got published in the first place.  Maybe it holds some interest for the digital photography historian who has twenty bucks to throw away.  Every single bit of information in this book can be found, for free, at dpreview.com.  You can also find all the information at dcresource.com, imaging-resource.com, or pcphotoreview.com.  (Any one of these sites would do, so you don't have to dig among all these sties.)<br /><br />This book is meant to be a survey of the current crop of digital SLRs.  (Fixed-lens digital cameras are not covered.)  Even though the copyright year is 2005, it's already way out of date.  To be fair, any such book will have little current value as the state of the d-SLR market changes rapidly.<br /><br />For example, the very important Nikon D70 is NOT covered in this book.  Nor is the smallish but capable Pentax *ist DS.  (The websites I listd above do cover these cameras, in lots of details.)  The omission of the D70 is a HUGE mistake, as that camera is important for being a full-featured d-SLR that sells at a consumer price point (unlike the feature-crippled Canon EOS Digital Rebel).<br /><br />This book is totally disappointing and holds no value whatsoever.	2004-12-20

It discusses how to make *creative* exposures (not just technically correct ones) in natural lighting situations.  I do wish the author had presented some clearer explanation on certain technical aspects, e.g., how to preset focus and how to get teh most out of a light meter, hence the 4 stars instead of 5.  Otherwise, it's a book that helps you think about how to create a photograph, not how to use every feature of your camera.<br /><br />Most of Peterson's instructions are taught through his own wonderful photos.  Each photo is well captioned about the context, his thought process, and his technique.  Again, this is not a \\"read and memorize the f-stop\\" kind of thing.  It's all about provoking ideas, and Peterson includes a lot of exercises (some more useful than others).<br /><br />I've been an advanced beginner for almost 20 years, and my photography has not improved much.  I hope this book can help me get over the hurdle and take better pictures.	2004-12-19

On the contrary, this book assumes you already have film photography concepts.  It's a concise guide to digital photography and focuses on how to make a transition from film photography to digital.  It does not, for example, tell you how to buy a digital camera.  Instead it just dicusses the important features of a digital camera (as well as scanners).  This is not a book that weighs 20 pounds which you'll never read.  It's small and can be carried with you when you need to consult it.<br /><br />Why would you want to consult it?  Well, it does have a lot of useful information.  Things like what to do with ISO settings, how to back up your image files, how to make effective edits in a photo-editing program, how to print.  This is really more of a tips book for the advanced beginner.  It also features three National Geographic photographers and talks about how they made the transition to digital.<br /><br />I like this book because it's concise, to-the-point and practical, and is not pretentious at all, unlike \\"The Joy of Digital Photography\\".  It may NOT have enough details for the absolutely beginner, and is unlikely to impress those who already know how to set bulb exposure.  But it's ultimately a book about how to leverage the advantages of digital photography in order to create good pictures.	2004-12-13

If you ever wondered what happens when you place an order to sell 10 million shares of GOOG (which you may or may not already own), or what transpires when you try to corner the silver market like the Hunt brothers, you'll find all the details in this book.  But it's more than that.<br /><br />For the most part accurate and easy-to-read, the 600-page book also covers issues that are of most importance to traders: where to trade, when to trade, how to trade, and what price to trade at.  Very detailed discussions reveal how the various market participants, from exchanges to broker-dealers to moronic traders, fulfill their respective roles in the Great Paper Wealth Game.  Entire chapters are devoted to speculators vs. liquidity suppliers.  The discussions on how each type of players trade and try to outsmart one another offer terrific insights into the psychology and techniques of market players.  Usually tedious topics such as order-matching rules and volatility measures are also covered well here.<br /><br />This is not a book about how to read stock charts or build sophisticated multi-variate GARCH models to predict volatility.  It's also not about how you could become a better gambler - the author says the gambler always loses, so you don't have much hope there.<br /><br />This practioner's book is about financial markets and its inner workings and the human beings that drive them.  If you want one authoritative reference volume on the mechanics of financial markets, this is it.<br /><br />My only quibble is it's expensive for someone who has to pay for the book out of their own pocket.	2004-12-10

I've used SAS for many years and I'm a fairly good programmer (though not a profesional one0, but I still get frustrated over SAS all the time.  The way the data steps work just kills my imagination and motivation.<br /><br />The present book offers some relief in the form of ready-to-use code segments for various topics in financial research.  It's a thin volume at 150 pages, so its usefulness and coverage are limited.  Covered topics include variance ratio testing in a random walk model, building event study code, and (most useful of the bunch) processing stock transaction data and running VAR regressions.<br /><br />Of course, if you are using SAS, chances you are smart enough to figure out most of the stuff on your own, but the book serves two good purposes: 1) to save us the time and frustrations of working with SAS, and 2) to help the SAS beginner learn how to think in SAS and program in SAS.  This is NOT a SAS primer.  Each chapter dives into the topic right away, first offering some research background (e.g., what is a random walk) and then offering detailed analysis of the sample code.<br /><br />In the end, it's the SAS code collection in this book that wins the book 4 stars from this harsh book critic.  There are a few errors but no hideous hidden bugs.  If you want to use SAS to quickly carry out some financial research, this book may be right for you.  On the other hand, it doesn't cover a lot, so those looking for a more comprehensive code compendium will be disappointed.	2004-11-26

You know, we C programmers are the best in the programming world, because C is such a great language.  The problem for us is, it's so hard to migrate to Perl, which is at the same time forgiving (no need to typedef any variables) and unforgiving (mistakes are hard to track down).  I don't like Perl.  For me its mantra \\"there's more than one way to do anything\\" signifies everything that's wrong with it.  Reading someone else's Perl code is even more of a nightmare than reading C code.  With C, once you understand all its shortcuts, you can understand any C code.  With Perl, even if you are a seasoned Perl programmer, someone else's code can still drive you nuts easily and shortens your life by a couple decades.<br /><br />Anyway, enough rambling.  \\"Perl for C Programmers\\" wants to help us C programmers make the transition to Perl.  It's an easy read and you can follow the explanations and code examples easily.  You can pretty much grasp all the basics in no time, as the book quickly goes through how things are done in Perl vs. in C.<br /><br />However, this book seriously lacks depth.  First of all, a lot of important Perl constructs such as hashes and references are not explained clearly or in detail.  If the camel book (\\"programming perl\\") is *too* detailed to the point of ad nauseum, this book is too shallow, and if you just rely on this book to learn Perl, you still won't be able to understand 80% of the code you might encounter.  Second, the book gives only superficial treatment on the differences between C and Perl.  Third, the book all too often scratches the surface of a topic, then refers you to the notoriously hard-to-read perldoc online docs for more details.  For example, the sort() function is probabably one of the most important text-processign functions an everyday Perl programmer uses, and it's a rich function (to the point of frustrating many a poor Perl programmer), but the book only gives a very passing description.<br /><br />What I noticed about the book -- and which pissed me off given how expensive this book is compared to other Perl books -- is it wastes a lot of space on stupid in-code comments (like the ridiculously looking arrowed comments for regexps) and regexp debug output (several pages long for somethign you'll probably never *want* to know).  The feeling after reading the book was really one of emptiness, like the $18-per-head buffet I had last month on the Scotia Prince ferry that only served lettuce and tomatoes and roast beef and lobster shells.<br /><br />Instead, I recommend starting with \\"Sam's Teach Yourself Perl in 24 Hours\\" if you want a quick kickstart on Perl, and \\"Sam's Teach Yourself Perl in 21 Days\\" if you have more time to learn.  Then be sure to read the camel book \\"Programming Perl\\" for the finer subtleties of this frustrating beast called Perl.

If you are a complete newbie to programming, this book is not for you, because it takes a \\"focus on the trees, ignore the forest\\" approach.  In other words, you are thrown into coding right away.  There's no high-level discussion of data structures and programming gotchas, etc.  There's a lot of stuff crammed into each lesson, and some of the lessons will likely take more than an hour (and more than one pass) to understand.  While this is not a reference at all, and many subtle details are omitted (which is actually a bad thing in the long run because Perl is such a complicated language), the book does get you started quickly.  A lot of practical examples are given to show you how the language works, and many of the snippets included can be used in your actual programming endeavors.  For example, you can take the code to find unique elements in a list as is and use it without any modification (save for using your own variable names).<br /><br />If you already have some programming background and need just one book to learn Perl quickly, this is the book for you.  After this, I'd recommend the \\"camel book\\", i.e., \\"Programming Perl\\" published by O'Reilly, which gives a forest-over-trees treatment to the language, plus it contains a useful reference on the language.	2004-10-05
US	52340667	R3E9UP3K2RTQP4	1884777805	441712394	Elements of Programming with Perl	Books	3	1	6	N	N	Ok for Perl learning, but not for complete newbies	It's strange that the author says he wants to teach non-programmers both programming skills and Perl knowledge, yet he introduces regular expressions, which are some of the most complicated programming concepts even to advanced people, very early in the book.  There is very little in the book to motivate someone who's never programmed before, as she will surely be intimated from the very beginning by code examples, pseudo-code listings, and uses of (absent explanations of) concepts completely alien to her.<br /><br />On the other hand, if the reader already knows something about programming (e.g., what regular expressions are!), and just wants an easy way to get started on Perl, she could benefit from the example-led style of Johnson.  The point to keep in mind is, this is not a book for learning programming, but a book for learning Perl.  As a Perl intro book, it is more relaxed than, say, \\"Sam's teach yourself Perl in 24 hours\\" and less boring than, say, \\"Learning Perl.\\"  I just wish the code examples were explained more clearly.	2004-10-05

Each lesson takes 1-2 hours, if you already have some programming background, and longer if you don't.  This book treats Perl more systematically and in more details than the \\"24 hours\\" book.  It explains a lot of concepts, including hashes and modules, more clearly than the \\"24 hours\\" book.  I recommend you do 2 or 3 lessons each day, because Perl is such a compact yet complicated language, that it's best to force yourself to learn it quickly, rather than slowly, because slow learning will make you forget things.  Be sure to study the examples in the book until you understand every line of code.	2004-10-05

As many professional reviewers (some of whom no doubt diehard Democrats) have pointed out, a lot of what's in the book is nothing short of outright lies. Like Whitewater, Monica-gate, to name just a couple of the scandals Bill Clinton's joke-of-a-presidency will forever be remembered for. Even a lot of the stuff about his youthful days has been questioned for their truthfulness. I was convinced this guy was the best con artist in american history, and after reading the book, I felt even more disgusted.<br /><br /> Give your money to charity instead of enriching this pants-on-fire liar.	2004-07-26

There's a lot of different definitions in the HF industry on what long/short equity really means.  Nicholas won't tell you what other authorities think.  So this is a book with a very narrow focus, but even in this area it fails to clearly identify the risks of these equity hedge funds.  You have to keep in mind that this guy is a promoter of the HF industry, so he's not an unbiased analyst of what hedge funds can do and cannot do.  He's here to &quot;sell&quot; hedge funds... and to sell his company's services.  I do not recommend this book because it's not objective at all.	2004-03-29

An entire chapter is devoted to this topic and it's an open and honest discussion with a focus on what *you* want out of franchising.  After you decide yes, it's right for you, it's time to get your hands dirty, and the book gives you a lot of information on every aspect of establishing a franchise and running it.  Luckily, the authors do not promote Wendy's blatantly, although there's little information on their hamburger franchising competitors.<br />I first read a library copy of this book but it was good enough for me so I bought my own copy.  I'm considering joining the franchising army, even though the compenstation doesn't seem attractive esp. in the first few years.  Maybe in 5 years I'll come back to this page and report my experience. :)<br />This book was published in 2000 but the information (except statistics cited) is quite up-to-date.	2004-03-10

Of course you didn't have to be amazon or ebay to survive the bloodbath, as many small independent shopping sites have been doing quite well.<br />This book doesn't tell you how to come up with a good idea -- I doubt anyone can really tell you, since successful entrepreneurship is seeded totally on individual creativity.  (Disclosure: I myself am still trying to come up with the mother of all &quot;how come I didn't think of that&quot; ideas.)  It's more about how to set up an e-commerce site, but the information is already outdated now that four years have passed.

Unfortunately the book proves to be very superficial, with tips of questionable quality and substance.<br />Five topics are covered: food, clothing, grooming, decoration, and culture.  I was hoping to get some \\"insider\\" tips on how to color-match my wardrobe and how to pick out power ties for different vacations.  Nope, neither topic is in there.  Plus a lot of other tips I was hoping to get.  Instead you get two pages on how to remove nose hair and some other equally useless stuff.  And this book is expensive!

S corps as well as LLCs are subject to the annual franchise tax of $325 or more.  Plus, the book says nothing about after your corporation becomes a federal S corporation, you must also elect New York State S corporation status in order to get tax benefits at the state level.<br />Anyway, the book covers a lot of topics but only very superficially and with other inaccuracies.  Also very little information on county-specific issues.<br />I do not recommend this book, for it will mislead you rather than educate you.	2004-03-08

This is not a help book that can show you insider secrets to getting rich (if they exist in form at all), nor is it a half-respectable autobiography.  Written back in 1989, at the height of his previous career, this book simply tells you that Donald Trump is the modern-day J.C.  Some of the accounts of his personal life are nauseating.  If you love the Donald like he was your b/f from a previous life, get this book.  For all others, avoid as there's no useful information here and its sold purpose was and is to get the Donald even richer.	2004-03-08

I doubt it's worth buying and keeping, but you may want a quick reference down the road.<br />The book presents short chapters on various apsects in a man's everyday life, from social etiquette to wardrobe to room decoration to music collection.  You have to remember, this is one pretentious guy's version of how *you* should live.  Whether single or committed, you should be the one deciding how you should live.  (Of course, within the limits of legality and ethics.)  You are already a grown-up, and you don't need others to tell you how you should behave.<br />That said, the book does have some interesting tips such as how to pick out a wine at a restaurant and how to act like an old-fashioned gentleman... or how to act \\"gayish\\" to attract other people's attention, be it from men or women.  It's sprinkled with humor, but it has two major problems that prompt me to recommend reading it over coffee rather than buying it:<br />1) there's a number of inaccuracies, and a lot of coverage is very superficial and incomplete<br />2) they use a 9-point font which to me seems more like a 7-point font, which means it's very difficult to read unless you have 20/40 vision (or vision temporarily improved by a white chocolate mocha or something else more stimulating).<br />In a nutshell, this small book can give you some interesting ideas about how to become a \\"metrosexual\\" man.  Whether that's what you want is up to you.	2004-03-08

I myself am looking to buy a condo and I especially enjoyed the chapters on &quot;curb appeal&quot; (exterior) and floor plans.  The latter topic is covered in a lot of details with examples of good layouts and bad layouts.  You may not totally agree with what the author says should be a good floor plan -- and I don't -- but it's great to know what the latest trend in floor planning is and what angles (no pun intended) you should see a home from.<br />The book covers from why you should buy a home to what to do if you are unhappy with your newly bought home.  Again, the target audience is really potential buyers of new homes, so there's a lot of information on that, like seeking out a builder's reputation, working with salespeople (as opposed to real estate agents), etc.<br />I recommend this book as a second book for getting home-buying advice.

Home Buying for Dummies is very comprehensive but reminds me of my own Ph.D. dissertation: heavy on theory but little on practicalities.

The Complete Idiot's Guide is by far the best of the bunch, and in case you are comparison-shopping, I think it's much better than the For Dummies title.<br />The biggest reason is the book, now in its fourth edition, is very comprehensive.  The bulk of it covers the buying aspects, but there are a few chapters devoted to selling, and this is a great arrangement.  As a potential buyer, it's to your advantage to know what it's like to sell, so when you select a property you will instinctly think of the time when you need to or have to sell.  In my caes, I plan to live in the condo for about 5 years and then move to a different city, so having a seller's perspective while I shop for a condo is really helpful.  For instance, I saw a nice condo yesterday which I would have bought but when I considered the selling perspective, I saw some problems and decided not to pursue it.  As a home buyer, especially a first-time home buyer like myself (that's why I bought this book!), you really want to make a well-rounded decision.  Sure there's no perfect house out there -- unless your definition of &quot;perfect&quot; is imperfect -- but the last thing you want is spend half a million dollars on something you regret right after you sign the closing docs.<br />Second, compared to many books this one is very well written.  Maybe I have a slight bias in favor of female writers, but I find women tend to be better in explaining complicated concepts than men.  This book is a perfect example of my stereotype.  Every chapter is easy to read and follow, and you see the major points right away.  The For Dummies title in particular suffers from information overflow and leaves you wondering what you've just read.  Which makes it next to being worthless, especially if you are in a rush to get acquainted with the real estate market.  There's a lot of information in this idiot's book but the top-notch organization makes it easy to digest... and remember.<br />(Don't forget, you don't want to carry a home-buying primer around when you shop for a house!  If you did you'd simply be taken for an unpleasant ride by greedy sellers and brokers.)<br />Third, like I mentioned before, this book also covers aspects of the selling process, so it's a great book to keep in case you need to sell.  In addition, when you do sell, you can review the home-buying chapters to learn what motivates the buyer, so to get your best deal!<br />To be honest at first I didn't like the format of this book; the page is wide and there seem too many words.  But because the authors write well and clearly, I eventually found it the best primer on home buying, with bonus coverage on the basic of home selling.<br />Very highly recommended, especially to previously clueless people like yours truly.nformation in this idiot's book but the top-notch organization makes it easy to digest... and remember.<br />(Don't forget, you don't want to carry a home-buying primer around when you shop for a house!

It covers both sound and sight and gives honest opinions on many things.<br />However, it suffers from excessive use of parenthesis and side notes and confusing run-on sentences.  Also, the explanation of key topics such DVI and a display's aspect ratio still leaves the reader highly confused.  The trouble seems to stem from the fact that neither author has a deep grasp of the home theater technologies and they might have just lifted all this information from various sources and put it in book form.<br />Since the book is cheap on Amazon, I still recommend it to all newcomers to the wonderful world of home theater.

Like the other books in O'Reilly's &quot;In a Nutshell&quot; family, the book has two parts: a quick rundown on the features of J2ME, and a reference part on all the details of the language.  The book's audience is someone who already knows something about the J2ME platform, such as how it looks, how it runs on a PC, and how it produces the code you can upload to a device.  If you want to see a tutorial type of book on J2ME, you won't find it here.  Since I never learned Java completely, I find it difficult to follow the book.  If you already know Java well, you may find the book easier to follow, although again you won't find detailed, step-by-step sample programs.<br />In short, probably great for someone already programming in J2ME; not helpful for someone wishing to learn J2ME.	2004-01-25

Being an actual game developer myself, I don't see much value in this book.  The only value is the beginner stuff about coding and basic game programming concepts.  The book does present a lot of code, but in a way it satisfies a lazy dummy's desire to see what programming code looks like.  Real game programming in these days of 3-D bells and whisles is much more complicated.  I haven't got around writing a true game programming primer yet -- and in the publishing business it's often whom you know rather than how much you know about the subject that gets you a book contract -- but let me say this.  If you want to write games, develop a solid foundation in C++, program a lot on a daily basis, and go work for a game company, or publish your own games as freeware.  Reading a book and poring over somebody else's old-time code won't make you a game developer.	2004-01-08

I know many an individual who, after reading the book, become so enamored with the culture described therein that they take it upon themselves to act like the &quot;human piranha&quot; or any of the other clownish characters from the book.<br />Having worked on Wall Street in various client-facing capacities over the years, especially as a trader with a volatile fund, I feel the book is a bit over melodramatic and over-sensational.  Are there such personas on Wall Street?  Absolutley.  In fact the real people on Wall Street -- the traders, the whiteshoe i-bankers, the jewish deal-makers and deal-breakers -- can be even meaner, nastier than Lewis describes.  But the clownish characters he creates are probably more fiction than real.  Still, his observation that most traders have huge egos and are among the most despicable human beings (despite their MBAs, Ph.D.s, or MDs) to ever walk on earth, is deadly accurate.  The constant politicking is captured vividly by the author, although, again, his writing seems to border on fiction quite often.<br />Don't take me wrong; I think this is a must-read for anyone interested in how Wall Street breathes and works.  Lewis does a fine job at exposing the disgusting nature of greed, the only thing that feeds Wall Street's daily existence.	2003-12-08

There's surprisingly very little about her years in the porn world and the 100 hardcore films she starred in as an underaged vixen.  There's also no mention of her family's Jewish background.  (She does mention that her great-grandmother on her mother's side was Irish, and her paternal grandfather came from the Ukraine.)  Each chapter is rather short, and the book reads like a diary with carefully picked entries.  There's a bit too much self-analysis.  Even the pictures, some in color, are a letdown.<br />The question is, of course, how much of what Lords writes is fact and how much is fiction.  But maybe that's just a silly question.  Like her films, Traci Lords's book is not to be taken seriously.	2003-10-08

The information is neither complete nor authoritatitve.  The chapter on treatment, for example, just lists the things you can go to a doctor for, and has a few paragraphs on alternative procedures such as acupuncture.  BTW, using yoga to treat RSI is probably the dumbest idea I've heard, myself being a former yoga practioner.  Imagine supporting your weight upside down on your injured wrists!

Well, I have homes in both, and have lived in Boston on and off for decades, so I do have some familiarity with that city, thank you very much.  Now, where in Hahvahd Yahd did I pahk my cah?<br />Seriously, even though I've lived in Boston for a long time it's still a city I don't feel very familiar with.  Its complex street system is one thing I'll never master.  It's the same feeling I have about Queens, NY, where I also lived for a while but never felt comfortable with.  I guess it's because I prefer organized cities.  (The small city I grew up in had just one main street, how nice and easy!)<br />Thankfully The Rough Guide to Boston is well organized and well written.  I've read through two dozen guide books on the city and this is by far the best.  The Fodor guide is too wordy and confusing, the Dummies guide too shallow and pretentious, the guide put out by the Hahvahd students totally indecipherable and inaccurate.  This volume has the right balance between information and entertainment.  It's concise yet complete, small yet immensely useful, and it's printed on nice paper so it'll last a good long time.  The &quot;24 things not to miss&quot; are the best &quot;best-of-Boston&quot; list I've seen because it goes beyond the obvious popular tourist spots.<br />If you plan to visit Boston or go to school there, get this high-quality book.	2003-09-22

(1) The coverage is not complete by any means.  It focuses on rental houses, apartment houses, and land.  Leaves out many other types, plus details on REITs, etc.  (2) The book is about profit analysis.  There's a chapter on negotiating and another on financing, but both are very short and not very enlightening.  Instead, you are fed a lot of time-value math.  This is actually good stuff, since as a RE investor you should be very clear about your profits and the impact of leverage and macro factors.  I just wish the title accurately reflected the book's content.	2003-08-08

He makes it abundantly clear that buying foreclosures is very risky, something ignored or downplayed by many other books on real estate speculation (specifically I have Tyler Hicks in mind; shame on Prentice Hall!).  The book starts with why there are foreclosures, how you can contact banks for safer deals, and, if you do want to go to an auction, what to do before, during and after.  There's also a chapter on the dangers of zero-down deals.<br />While I liked the content, I found the material somewhat difficult to follow.  For example, in the very first chapter the author tries to explain to you what &quot;mortgage&quot; really is; but after re-reading the two pages three times, I still couldn't fully grasp what he meant.  Maybe it's because I'm dumb.  But there are many, many other sections which are not easy to comprehend, and they are not helped by fragmented sentences and illogical since-hence conclusions.<br />In short, I think this book is worth reading if you are thinking of doing foreclosures like I was.  There are some valuable tips that can help you avoid costly pitfalls; I know first-hand what a nightmare dealing with destructive tenants and former landlords can be, and so should you.	2003-08-08

In fact, the bulk of the material was written almost twenty years ago.  The concept of nothing down real estate investing is surely an alluring one, and I readily admit that the title is what drew my attention to the book.  However, you should know if something sounds too good to be true, it is.  Nothing down does not work in most metro areas, plus tax laws have changed so it's now harder to get tax breaks.  Also because the housing market is hot in good areas -- and as the cliche goes, the three most important factors in buying real estate are location, location and location, and good locations don't come cheap -- the so-called negotiationg tricks in this book will NOT work.  I've tried them here in the New York metro area and the lawyers, apparently familiar with the concept, laughed their heads off at my naivete.  So take it from me, nothing in this book will really help you.  Sure, if you put in 15 hours a day and slave away calling every seller, you might come across some old lady who bought her house 50 years ago for five grand and will now sell it to you for half a million with no money down, and her lawyer doesn't care, etc., but you might as well play the lottery each week and probably have a better chance of hitting the jackpot.<br />Of course, reading this book does show you how much of the real estate market is dominated by greed and debt.  But you already knew that, didn't you?	2003-08-05

There are only two things you can do to become a master -- and take this from someone who after years of training is finally on the right track -- first, find a good personal coach (you may be able to write off the cost; check with IRS), and second, practice and do so in real settings, not just in front of your bathroom mirror!<br />That said, this book can help you get started if the thought of public speaking makes you hungry for two Big Macs, i.e., makes you nervous.  The chapters are laid out nicely, guiding you through the various components of giving a speech as well as techniques on how to control your emotions.  What I found most beneficial was the part on preparation.  I was always too lazy to prepare and my instinct was to improvise, but this book showed me how to overcome that tendency and think about what I was going to say.<br />In all earnest, you don't need to read this book or any other book to become proficient in public speaking, but if a book helps you calm down and gather your courage, this book should be on your shelf.	2003-08-01

Why?  Because when you save two pennis, close to one is taken away by the government, unless you are some dirt-wealthy person protected by tax shelters and a carribean passport.  So by not eating that $... sushi meal, it's the same as you just earned $..., minus the cost of the McD burger.<br />Tobias also points out the pitfalls in many popular investments, ranging from stamps to whole life insurance to insider stocks.  The book is refreshing, even after 25 years.  I totally wish I had had heeded his advice all these years.  Indeed, if I had just bought some long-term bonds back when interest rate hit double digits, I would have retired long ago.  Instead I played the equity market and in all these years, came out flat at best, not counting the uncountable number of sleepless hours and numerous occasions of near heart attacks.<br />Because Tobias aims to keep the volume slim -- although the latest edition is bigger and 3 times more expensive than the last one I bought back in 1989 -- a lot of important things are left out, e.g., real estate, trusts, etc.  Half of the book is devoted to stocks.  While the advice is must-read for every small investor, I was hoping to see more content on bonds and also chapters devoted to hedge funds and real estate.  Sure Tobias can say something about these increasingly popular vehicles.<br />A timeless classic marred by some missing chapters, but still a gem in a world populated by useless investment advice, in book form or in person.	2003-07-31

It's primarily a how-to guide, clearly written and illustrated.  (The sample video shots are low-quality, though, esp. that ugly black/dark grey cat!)

Casual users should stay away for now until they become familiar with Windows. Also, strangely, you won't find coverage of Windows Movie Maker in this otherwise complete power user's guide to WinXP.<br />This &quot;deluxe edition&quot; is hardcover (vs. paperback for the regular, cheaper edition), has two added chapters (one on fax and one on advanced user adminitration), and includes a couple interesting e-books from Microsoft on the CD-ROM, in addition to an e-book version of the book itself.<br />This book covers both the Pro and Home editions of WinXP -- and each chapter has a handy brief discussion of the differences between the two editions. In fact, I find this feature, together with the two extra free e-books, worth the price premium over the regular edition. Besides, hardcovers are just easier to lay down on a desk and they last longer as well.<br />In terms of &quot;meaty stuff,&quot; this book will satisfy your hunger for advanced knowledge of XP. After reading the book you'll become an XP expert. If you want to become a guru, then get the other &quot;Inside Out&quot; books such as Windows XP Networking Inside Out and Windows XP Security Inside Out (highly recommended). Or you can use this book as a jumping board to acquire some advanced knowledge and then figure out the guru-advanced topics yourself. Either way, this book can help you master Windows XP.<br />Still not convinced? Pick a copy and read the chapter on system optimization. Clearly written and organized, the chapter gives you everything you need to know about optimizing Windows, including the best explanation of the performance monitor I've come across (as well as concrete steps for taking advantage of this and other tools). Then you'll see how useful this book is.	2003-06-03

The paperback version is, not surprisingly, cheaper and more portable (but still heavy!).<br />There's a lot of &quot;meat&quot; in this book, and the two authors did a wonderful job of keeping the book very well organized and very well written.  The writing is fluid and you can almost read it like a novel, of course, assuming you are a PC geek like myself.  Most other computer books I can hardly follow without sitting in front of the computer, but this book is so clear and well illustrated that I read chapter after cheapter in one sitting even when I did not have my XP laptop with me.<br />In terms of content, it covers everything an advanced user needs in order to fine-tune Windows XP.  Both Profesional and Home editions of the OS are covered.  (The hardcover version of the book has a nice summary on the differences at the beginning of *each* chapter.)

But for something as complex as Windows XP Home Edition, having a paperback ready for referencing is quite important -- even though XP is actually pretty easy to learn and use even on your own.<br />David Pogue, who has been an Apple Macintosh evangelist for years, is now also writing Windows training books, presumably because there's simply more money to be made from Windows users/readers. Whatever his motives, Pogue's writing style has improved a lot since his early days as a Macworld columnist (when I used to be unable to stand his verbosity), and this book is a very useful guide to Windows XP Home Edition. (A separate book, co-authored by Pogue, covers Windows XP Pro Edition. I think it would have been nicer to just have one book for both versions, but I guess the business decision and greed got the upper hand.)<br />What surprised me about the book is that Pogue makes no attempt at mocking Windows XP like so many anti-Microsoft people like to do. He just tells us how to make the most out of Windows XP Home Edition. Starting with a brief and clear overview of the OS, he moves quickly to guiding the reader through all the features of Windows XP, covering pretty much everything you can do. The only thing I can think of that's missing is DVD burning and wireless networking. But these can be considered \\"advanced\\" topics. Of course, the book does have a sidebar on the differences between the Home Edition and the Pro Edition, so you can decide for yourself whether you need to upgrade to the Pro version... hopefully before you buy this book!<br />Some errors aside, the book makes a good companion to the more-than-casual XP user. It does so by giving him tons of step-by-step guides as well as useful tips, and I in particular like the right number of screenshots, which are not too many or too few. The placement of some of the screenshots, however, can be confusing, and I hope the next edition can rectify this annoyance.  My biggest complaint is the font is too small and punishing for my poor eyes.<br />In summary, this is one guide to WinXP Home that every user can understand and learn a thing or two from.

Working with previously classified Chinese documents, the book details how Mao and his military commanders (led by Peng Te-huai, who was purged three years after the Armstice) differed on the strategies and tactics, with Mao coming across as an incompetent bureaucrat who placed zero value on the lives of his soldiers.  While there are many mistakes in this book concerning the movements of the U.S. forces (likely because Prof. Zhang is quoting from Chinese military memos -- but it would have been nice if he caught them and corrected them), this book is a must-read for every American who has not forgotten the Forgotten War and the hundreds of thousands of U.S. casualties.	2003-04-24

It's equally fascinating to us today how America and China both paid dearly to defend the two Koreas, with Red China losing 10-20 times as many men as the U.S., and 50 years later, neither country is appreciated (or liked) by their respective protege.  Wars, indeed, are silly and futile, especially when you die for others.<br />The book details the bloody battles around Wonju in early 1951.  While the major phases of the Korean War had ended by Christmas 1950, the Chinese, under the leadership of the psychotic general Peng Te-hwai (Peng Dehuai), only began to launch their massive human wave attacks in 1951, pretty much all of which ended in failures and cost the Chinese half a million lives but also inflicted heavy losses on U.S./UN forces.  Wonju is a prominent example of the insanity of war, especially at an individual level.  The accounts here are a little too lengthy and confusing at times, but Coleman makes an attempt to provide a comprehensive story.  The bravery of the young American soldiers fighting for a people unappreciative of their actions (even the Rhee gov't resented American intervention, despite the fact it came very close to being swallowed by their North brothers who had no love for them) comes out alive in the pages, but you can also feel for the peasant \\"volunteer\\" soldiers of Red China who died like ants rushing into a fire, so their comrades behind could march on.<br />A worthy read for everyone interested in military history... and the history of human suffering.	2003-04-24

Unfortunately, it's grossly inadequate.  The worst part is there are full of errors, encompassing typos in the Excel spreadsheets and technical inaccuracies.  The coverage of a lot of topics is also quite superficial, for example, the chapters on calculating the efficient frontier ignore the important question of utility.  (That is, the author maximizes wealth instead of utility.)  In trying to cover a lot of ground in finance, from leasing to VaR to options, the book ends up doing nothing well, and the effort in presenting some theory before showing how it's implemented in Excel is laudable but ultimately laughable because much of the theory is presented quite poorly.  In the end, you may find some value in understanding at a general level how to translate theory into Excel, esp. if you are new to the application.	2003-01-13

The chapters deal with various topics from dissociating where you live with your name to using trusts or LLCs for important purchases to protecting yourself while online.<br />Much of the information is very interesting and thought-provoking, and the author apparently makes it clear that \\"he\\" doesn't want you to break the law.<br />However, much of what \\"he\\" dispenses as advice may not be practical.<br />1) Ghost address: the author recommends you go to a small town, far from where you actually live, and look for a place with a few private mailboxes and rent one.  I have been trying this for the last 2 months but everywhere I went the owner would look at me suspiciously and then ask me for my license.  Maybe it's because I live in New York state... or maybe it's because post-Sept. 11 people are just more vigilant.<br />2) Using LLCs to buy cars: the author suggests you register your cars in the name of a New Mexico LLC, which won't need your name to incorporate.  Obviously, if you go to your state DMV they'll demand to see all kinds of IDs, so the author says you should go to a private licensing bureau.  Well, I haven't found a single one in New York or Massachusetts that would allow me to register my car without proof of address.  Again, maybe it's because I'm not charming enough, or it could be that this advice and the social engineering skills needed just don't work well these days.<br />These are just two examples of the kind of advice the author gives.  Indeed, to be fair, he warns you early on that achieving even level 1 (of 4) privacy may not be cheap, and definitely not easy.  My problem with his methods is, they aren't too practical and require too many steps.  I might as well get plastic surgery and move to the ex-USSR republic of Georgia.	2002-10-16

I followed all his rules, such as only buy stocks that have excellent fundamentals (as rated in his newspaper, Investor's Business Daily), that have recently made new highs, and that have good institutional sponsorship.  I also followed the exit rules.<br />Needless to say, I missed all the big money-making opportunities in the late 90s.  In fact, I only earned meager returns on my \\"sound fundamentals\\" portfolio, and when the bubble burst, my portfolio took a plunge, wiping out all my profits.  The only thing I can laugh about is all my friends are down 80+% with their tech-ladden holdings.  But, dude, if I had put the money in T-bills, I would have earned much higher returns, and wasted much, much less time on \\"research,\\" than with O'Neil's painstaking approach.<br />Having made no money in stocks over the last 10 years, I do feel like a sore loser.  Rationally speaking, I now believe the stock market is at best a random walk and at worst a sham.  Investors of all ages should stay away and invest in bonds and real estate instead.  Forget what I just said, invest in bonds only.	2002-09-25

How to Use Them for Profit and Protection)	Books	4	20	20	N	N	A classic and definitive guide, but needs updating	This book, published in 1993, is now a classic and the definitive guide to trading LEAPS.  It provides an excellent introduction to LEAPS and takes the pain to explain how LEAPS differ from traditional options.  If you already have knowledge of options, this book will be a breeze to you, thanks to the author's lucid and humorous writing style.  Do keep in mind that LEAPS are more than just longer-term options; pricing them using BS, for example, would be quite wrong.<br />Which brings us to the drawback of this book from the early 90s.  Much as changed to LEAPS -- the demand, the valuation methods, the trading mechanics -- since 1993, and this book would have remained great had it been updated.  As it stands, you should definitely use it in conjunction with the web to make sure you get the latest info on these securities.<br />One last thing: if you are set on trading LEAPS, make sure your broker can accommodate it.  My online broker is great for trading options, but it turns out they won't allow LEAPS for accounts less than $50k, which include mine.<br />In short, I recommend this book highly as a primer to LEAPS.  Read it from cover to cover and make sure you duly understand all the RISKS involved, not just the potential gains.  Good luck!	2002-08-21

The one sold here may be a better copy-edited version.<br />While the slim volume does not provide a comprehensive view of stock trading, it does offer some interesting thought provokers among its six chapters:<br />- Emotions of investing in a bear market<br />- The trend is your friend<br />- Stops<br />- Buying puts<br />- Shorting stocks<br />- Collars<br />As you can see, most of the chapters deal with investing in a bear market, although reading through them reminds one of the perils of stock trading even in a bull market.  Frankly, I wish I had received this book earlier, before my own trading account melted down by over 60% from the peak in spring 2000.  The chapter on collars (which the author calls &quot;free insurance&quot; on a stock, but it's more complicated than that) was an eye opener.  If I had followed the advice offered in the book, I would probably have cut my losses by half.  I have started using collars and stops, and they worked well to protect myself from the big market drop in July.<br />This book is written in plain English and is easy to read and understand.  While I don't know if the author is a successful investor himself, I'm glad his book has helped me somewhat.	2002-08-21

The author starts with an insider's look at how car dealerships (which always look like dungeons to me) are structured and how they make money and how they are out to extract as much profit from you, the customer, as possible.  Then he dispenses some of the best advice I've seen on how to get the best price on a car.  BTW, I'm an avid Consumer Reports subscriber, and the info in this book is even better than the guide put out by the good people at CR.<br />Some of the most useful information I found in the book includes starting your offer at one thousand *below* invoice, not at invoice as Consumer Reports suggests; why Saturn's no-haggle policy is really a sham; why buying a year-end model doesn't necessarily save you thousands; and the best time of year, month and day to buy.  Whether you buy, lease or finance, the author constantly reminds you that getting the best price is the most important step in buying a car.<br />Every page of this book is filled with helpful and useful tips that *will* save you thousands (unless you are getting a hot rod like the new Honda Pilot where demand exceeds supply).  And the author is honestly interested in helping us &quot;little people&quot; fight against slick dealerships and their fleets of lying salesmen.

This book is now four years old, so the information is pretty much irrevelant.  While one can argue the principles of Windows game programming are the same, you simply can't do much with the information in this book any more.

Besides, there are a lot of inaccuracies in the book (e.g., &quot;first games were written for UNIX mainframes in the 60s and 70s&quot;...

The book follows the same hollow structure as Rasiel's first book and is half a rip-off of McKinsey's BCR training program (plus the ILW and some from the ELW) and half useless interviews with McKinsey alumni who boast after they received the latter end of the \\"up-or-out\\" policy they were able to show how inferior their new employers were on the management IQ scale.  If you want concrete case studies -- which is why I picked up the book -- it contains none.

The first five chapters discuss the very basics of PS2 -- while it reads better than the half-baked English in the PS2 user's guide, the information is just too basic.  The second part, printed on yellow pages, lists about 200 games and gives game summary info as well as hints for a few of them.  No, not all 200 games are for PS2 only; many, if not most, are actually PSX games, but they are here because the author and his collaborators think they are worthy games.  Okay, I can buy that, but there's very little about each game -- esp. the ones many people are unfamiliar with -- that tells us why exactly we should spend money on it.  Detailed information about all these games can be found on GameSpot.com, so I felt a bit sore about spending $15 on this book which turns out to have so little useful information.<br />My advice: there's nothing in this book you can't find on any good PS2 fan sites, so save your money and head over to the Net for better information that's also free.	2001-10-17

Funny, I bought the book because I already knew why and because I wanted to learn how to do it.  In other words, the author tries too hard -- waste the reader's time -- justifying the legitimacy of reflexology.<br />So you don't get your feet wet (no pun intended) until chapter 13, when the author starts talking about techniques.  Unfortunately she's too talkative; there's a lot of unnecessary stuff, which the book falls short when it comes to really teaching you and me how to practice reflexology.

In fact, these were the same difficulties many other American businesses ran into in the 1980s, when everyone was eager to get into the Chinese market. I think the same problems remain today. In fact, the Chinese bureaucracy is 10 times more corrupt (in more than one incident the first thing visiting Chinese officials to the U.S. ask of their American hosts is &quot;where is the brothel with blonde girls?&quot;) and the Chinese people more anti-Western than in the 1980s. The BJ Jeep story is not outdated. Every business exec who thinks of doing business in China must read this book, not some sugarcoated account of how great China is. I grew up in China in the 80s and witnessed the economic revolution firsthand. What pained me the most, even as a teenager, was how corrupt the Chinese society and government was becoming. Red envelopes -- the venue for bribery -- were becoming commonplace, and demanded by every level of bureaucrats with any degree of power. My recent return trips to China confirmed that the situation had not improved at all but worsened. Busisiness negotiations are a nightmare with the mainland Chinese. The book has a very interesting discussion in the beginning about how overseas Chinese are so efficient while the mainlanders are both inefficient, greedy, and inept. Trust me, all these are still true today.<br />From my point of view, China is not a market every American business should or must enter. Most foreign companies that have joint ventures do *NOT* make money in China and will probably not do so in the foreseeable future. The only ones that made a lot of money were the Japanese, who flooded (as told in the book) the Chinese market in the 80s with cheap, good consumer goods that the mainland Chinese hadn't seen. Nowadays it's more difficult as China's own companies are getting competitive as well as people are no longer held in awe by Western-style products. What this book teaches, then, is how to keep your expectations low if you want to do business in China, as well as how to avoid some of the common mistakes American executives tend to make, such as assuming the efficiency of the Chinese system or presuming the chain of command. This book will serve as an excellent reminder that mainland China is still many, many years behind the West in both management style, operational efficiency, and cultural honesty.ple are no longer held in awe by Western-style products.

The person who wins the trick leads anything he likes from his remaining cards to the next trick, and the process repeats itself until all the cards have been played.&quot;<br />I simply could not understand this paragraph no matter how many times I read it, until I consulted a friend good at Hearts.  This is typical of the arcane writing throughout this book.  It's simply not easy for a dummies.  In fact my friend was totally lost when he read this paragraph.  The way he described it to me was just so much clearer.<br />The book does cover a wide range of card games.  Unfortunately it does a very poor job at teaching you how to play these games.  Often the author discusses strategies without even explaining what things are and what the rules are, leaving you totally clueless and obfuscated.<br />I haven't read a book as frustrating as this one in a long time.  I highly recommend you stay away from it.	2001-04-04

This book identifies seven traits Jews share that enable them to become leaders of America. Apparently intelligence alone isn't sufficient. Lots of examples and common sense.

From its founding by a Jewish peddler to a global financial powerhouse, Goldman Sachs has seen lots of ups and downs which are documented by this book. Written by a former Goldman vice president, the book has more praises for the firm than criticism. All too often it sounds not critical enough of the firm's mistakes. If you come here for insight on how Goldman became successful as a business, you'll be disappointed.	2001-03-12

Starting with a brief history of speculation and progressing to finance theory, &quot;Inventing Money&quot; places the Long-Term saga in a historical context.  Indeed, almost half of the text has nothing to do with Long-Term directly, but Long-Term was not created in isolation.  People from academia and &quot;the Street&quot; made its existence possible, and this book chronicles its development very well.<br />A bit more technical than &quot;When Genius Failed,&quot; this book gives the reader lots of background material on the theory behind what Long-Term was supposed to do: namely, arbitrage.  As a Ph.D. student of financial economics, I found Dunbar's explanations easy to understand, but I can also see that they will be quite obfuscating to non-specialists in this area.  The second part, about Long-Term's dealings, is easier to understand for everyone.  While his account of what transpired to Long-Term is not as vivid as Lowenstein's, I think Dunbar does a laudable job at keeping the story flowing.  BTW, the paperback addition has a thoroughly updated last chapter, &quot;Aftermath.&quot;<br />If you are interested in the Long-Term story, both books are worth keeping.  If you have to choose, go with &quot;Inventing Money&quot; if you are also interested in the history of finance theory and financial engineering; if you prefer an &quot;insider's view,&quot; &quot;When Genius Failed&quot; would be a better choice.	2001-03-01

Well-written and well-organized, this book introduces the game to beginners but can also be used as a reference for experienced players.  Everything you need to know about pool is here: a brief history, choosing your equipment, proper stance and strike, how to aim and control your speed, rules, variations, etc.  The authors not only give you a thorough grounding in the mechanics of pool playing, but also discuss the proper mental state when you approach the pool table.  Every one of the almost 500 pages -- this is a big book for the Complete Idiot's Guide series! -- is filled with valuable information.<br />Whether you play pool for social fun or for tournament, this is a must-have book.	2001-02-28

This book comes to the rescue.  Unlike the other Pocket PC book I bought (&quot;How to Do Everything with Pocket PC and Handheld PC&quot;), this book is written expressly for the Pocket PC and the author never mistakenly uses the technically correct but politically incorrect &quot;WinCE&quot; name.  This shows he knows who his audience is.<br />The book starts off with a brief history of Pocket PC (and its WinCE predecessors) and a quick overview of the hardware specs.  It even lists benchmark results of a few Pocket PCs, although the list is a bit outdated at this point (Feb. 2001).  It then delves into the issues of using your Pocket PC daily.  From Pocket Outlook to Pocket IE to Pocket Streets, this book covers them all.  There are also a lot of tips to help you get to know your Pocket PC better.<br />The author's writing style is also laudable.  Unlike the other book which is difficult to read, this one is very easy to follow and you'll want to read it again and again, like I do.  Beginners and intermediate users alike will find this book invaluable.  (Now I wish there were a book for power Pocket PC users...)  The author even gives a lot of tips about switching over from Palm.<br />I highly highly recommend this book to every newcomer to the wonderful world of Pocket PC.	2001-02-25

As with the other volumes, this book does not give you much information beyond the superficial.  What irks me the most -- something I didn't realize when I purchased the book -- is that this book covers both Pocket PC and HandheldPC, which means you'll probably only need half of the book while paying for 300 pages of stuff you'll never use.<br />For the Pocket PC, the book walks you through how to set up your new toy and how to use the major applications: Pocket Outlook, Pocket Word, Pocket Excel, Pocket Money, and Pocket Internet Explorer.  (Pocket Access and PowerPoint for HandheldPC are also covered.)  It was able to answer some of the questions I had had about using the Pocket PC, so it did prove helpful.  At the same time, a lot of information is left out.  For example, is there an optimal way to adjust the memory settings?  The book doesn't tell you.  Are there any third-party application switchers that automatically stop an application a la the Palm?  The book doesn't tell you.<br />Another annoying thing about this book is that it was obviously written in a hurry to include Pocket PC features.  It might have been a Windows CE book, so you see WinCE references everywhere.  As of today there's only one other good Pocket PC book (forget about &quot;Pocket PC for Dummies&quot; and save some money), &quot;Unauthorized Guide to Pocket PC&quot;, and I recommend that one over this one.	2001-01-29

Published in 1995, the section on camcorder equipment is already half outdated.  The techniques sections cover zooming, panning, tilting, composing, etc.  Each of the 101 tips is very brief, to the point of not being too helpful sometimes.  For example, lighting -- a very important topic -- receives only superficial coverage.<br />While this book can be carried with you easily, overall it's a disappointment.  If you are genuinely green to camcorder videography, this can get you started.  If you are looking to improve your videos, look elsewhere.	2001-01-23

I was expecting another &quot;let me show you how to write the best business plan&quot; kind of book.  Instead, I found a very enjoyable and practical book that should be a must-read for every aspiring entrepreneur, regardless of which industry this aspiration may lie in.<br />The 266-page book is divided into 27 chapters, each covering a specific topic.  That makes about 10 pages per chapter, which translates into material that's easily understandable and digestable.  Topics covered range from risk assessment to basic accounting (very basic indeed, but an excellent way to start especially becuase many of us find accounting unbearably boring) to managing resources to, yes, writing a business plan.  The author mixes his philosophical musings along with anecdotes and hard business lessons (like calculating NPV and profits).  His constant humor and approachable style make the book very easy and fun to read.<br />The emphasis of the book is on how an entrepreneur should *think*.  Of course, thinking often is not enough; action is also paramount.  But starting with the right mindset increases the chance of success -- and also helps one live more happily.  The author points out very early on that we all fear failure, and this fear holds most of us back from starting our own businesses.  He then delves into how we can overcome this fear partially by analyzing the risks associated with an adventure.  This approach makes the subject much less boring than one otherwise expects and also makes the material easier to absorb.  As Zhuangzi, the ancient Chinese philosopher, once said, &quot;Starting with the right mind set increases your chance of success tenfold.&quot;  The constant mind coaching from this book is what I appreciate the most.<br />The author writes as he speaks, so there are a few grammatical and punctuation errors, but overall this book is highly readable and you may be like me and not want to stop in the middle of a chapter.  Each chapter should be read at least twice.  In this regard, this book reminds me of Dale Carnegie's classic volume on achieving popularity: full of useful and practical information so that you can never re-read it too many times.is book is highly readable and you may be like me and not want to stop in the middle of a chapter.

As someone who also knows Japanese and Chinese, my overall impression of this  title is that it is very confusing if used as a self-learning text, but is  still the best introductory Korean textbook I've seen.<br />Strengths:  Thorough introduction to the language; insistent use of the Han'gul (Korean  script); good grammar notes.<br />Weaknesses:  VERY bad audio CD (way too fast  for beginners, and not enough basic sounds); choppy English at times; too  much Han'gul at the beginning which makes the first few lessons  intimidating; forces you to learn their phonetic system; total lack of  Chinese characters (given that most non-Korean students of the language  seem to be Chinese or Japanese, it would be nice to include such characters  both as a necessity to complete the course and as a study aid).<br />All in  all, it's a very difficult course to follow, but if you persevere and study  the materials carefully, you'll get a good grasp of the Korean  language.<br />[If anyone knows of a Korean text for Chinese or Japanese  speakers, please let me know.  I'm really having a hard time with this  book: I'm re-studying it for the second time and my Korean totally sucks.]	2000-08-16

Admittedly XML is a complex topic to discuss, but another book &quot;XML: A Primer&quot; by St. Laurent does a much  better job at showing the reader how XML works and is constructed.  This  book, in contrast, fails to show the poor reader what exactly XML is about  -- and can do, and how one goes about developing actual XML applications.  I mean, there are the code samples and explanations and everything, but  after reading it I could not remember a single thing about XML.  (I had to  buy &quot;XML: A Primer&quot; to start all over again.)  It's the rare kind  of bad books that leave you unable to describe what you've just read.<br />The  book won't do as a primer, nor will it do as a reference.  I suggest that  you find a copy and read it first before deciding whether to buy it.	2000-07-25

Everything is explained clearly, making learning the software easy and effortless.  Too many other  books (esp. the &quot;Bible&quot; series from IDG) are rushed and written  by people who do not understand proper English.  The &quot;Running&quot;  series sets a high standard for software training books.<br />That said, this  particular volume allows the reader to use the mammoth software package  efficiently and also to find answers to questions a typical user may have  in the course of a typical day.  Each application is given the right amount  of coverage -- note that if you want detailed info on a specific  application, like Word or Access or Excel, get the &quot;Running...&quot;  book for that app.  After reading it, I felt much more comfortable  navigating the Office suite and also felt much more confident using some of  the more powerful features that I had always dreaded in the past.<br />Highly  recommended to every Office 2000 Professional user.	2000-07-12

I picked this book up two weekends ago after getting totally frustrated with &quot;XML for Dummies&quot; (avoid that book!).  This book set aside my fears of not being able to grasp the complex topic  and now I can talk all about XML at cocktail parties!<br />The book has some  basic review on HTML and then takes you quickly into the world of XML.  Take a look at the table of contents and you'll see the coverage is very  complete.  Like other Microsoft Press books this one is well written and  edited.<br />I disagree with Michael (the second reviewer) on the issue of IE.  IE 5 is the only browser (as of July 00) that works properly with XML and  does so consistently.  It's very important for developers to work with the  right tools, so the promotion of IE 5 (despite the Microsoft linkage) can  be understood and forgiven.	2000-07-12

The tourist does not have time to wait for the right moment or most ambient lighting, and this  book helps by showing how one can tell the story of a place through  photographing its people and landmarks and how to capture its soul and  essence through simple techniques.  The discussion is gentle and clear, and  the accompanying photos are great eye-openers.  My own travel photography  -- using a cheap digital camera -- visibly improved after I read this book.  I wish I had bought it sooner.<br />In short, if you are looking for a pro  guide, try other books (like the 'pro lighting' series).

The strengths of the book are: breadth (see the table  of contents for the large number of topics covered), practicality (you  learn the theory and also how to apply theory in practice), and clarity  (very easy to follow).  The student does not need prior knowledge to  understand the materials.<br />When I worked on Wall Street all my colleagues  had a copy of Brealey and Myers.  The new edition updates the text (I have  not found any major changes).  A must-have for those interested in the  basics of corporate finance.

The lack of good examples is another problem with this slim ()volume.<br />A good introductory book should be like DiIorio's &quot;SAS Applications Programming&quot;: easy enough to NOT intimidate the beginner, yet deep and comprehensive enough to enable the reader to get real work done -- and to encourage the reader to learn more advanced topics.  (After all, we use stats software like Matlab to get real work done, not just to impress our girlfriends.)

Then there are chapters on SAS programming elements (expressions, logic  flows, etc.) as well as intermediate-advanced statements.  The MERGE  statement is explained very clearly.<br />Examples abound, although I feel  that they are presented in a very confusing format -- often you can't tell  if a block of text belongs to the main text or an example.  The  organization of the book is also a little confusing, esp. if you want to  use it as a reference book (not recommended; stick with SAS manual set  instead).<br />In short, this book provides an excellent ovewview of SAS.

First, let me say that I wish the authors had updated the book, since the computer business has gotten VERY fascinating since the  launch of Windows 95, as the Internet seized the day and also as an  intrusive DOJ started an effort to dismantle a 20-year-old company that had  suddenly become America's Public Enemy No. 1.<br />That said, this book  provides excellent accounts of Bill Gates as a person and Bill Gates as  Microsoft.  The emphasis is on how Bill Gates ran Microsoft as a business,  how he interfacted with his employees, business allies and competitors.  If  you are looking for information on how Windows 3.0 or Flight Simulator was  designed, this is not the place.  But if you want to know how Microsoft  really got started, how Gates allegedly &quot;screwed&quot; Apple, or how  Gates started dating Melinda French, you'll find it right here.<br />Stephen  Manes has been a long-time critic of Microsoft's producty quality (and  rightly so, IMHO), and the book comes across as quite critical of Gates'  business tactics (&quot;bullying&quot;, &quot;anti-competitive&quot;, etc.)  and personal idiosyncracies (both selfish and selfless, intolerant, etc.).  At the same time the authors show admiration for the Gator as a technical  and business genius.  But because the authors evidently believe that  Microsoft has done lots of evil, every conflict Microsoft had with a  competitor would be Microsoft's fault.<br />In summary, this book is easy to  read, generally objective (Gates was interviewed extensive for this  &quot;unauthorized&quot; biography), and informative.  I highly recommend  it to anyone fascinated by Bill Gates and Microsoft.	2000-05-08

Jews were persecuted and executed  because of their successes and because of the perception that they are  masters of underhanded techniques, and in this book Bill Gates is portrayed  as too smart to be a good man, and since he's so successful, he must be  evil, must be prosecuted, and must be disgraced.<br />I think the author  started the book on an incorrect premise (that Gates is the Devil himself),  and tainted the whole case against Microsoft with her personal prejudice.  You can't find anything positive about Gates, or Ballmer.  On the other  hand, the DOJ is portrayed as heroes, and Microsoft's competitors as  innocent victims (read the part on Netscape!).<br />My suggestion is that read  other books on Microsoft first before you pass a judgement, just like  recent revelations about DOJ's handling of Waco tell us that the line  between devil and hero can be very blurry.	2000-05-08

At the same time, when this guy is an ex-employee, you should always ask yourself: why did he leave, and what does he have to gain from writing a book like  this?<br />The authors are evidently very anti-Microsoft, yet at the same time  their stories come across not so much as how stupid Microsoft is, but how  mismanaged and lucky Gates &amp; Company have been, which is closer to the  truth than many people think.  Some other books describe Gates and his  employees as evil, but this book would characterize them as rather  incompetent.  It offers a detailed look into how Microsoft committed so  many business goofs and yet every time it would come out the winner.  After  reading it you may even feel sorry for Bill Gates for having to fight so  many enemies on so many fronts, some internal.<br />A book worth reading.	2000-05-08

After reading just the few pages I realized this book was what I had been looking for before traveling to Britain.<br />This book has at least two excellent features:  1) everything is explained clearly and concisely, so you won't  miss the important details; and 2) the author lists and recommends specific  B&amp;Bs and hotels, which can be very helpful in picking out a place to  stay.<br />[I personally value the first point a great deal.  All too many  travel books -- Let's Go, &quot;Rough Guide&quot; -- are wordy and use  small fonts that just throw you off -- but this book focuses on useability  and practicality, so every bit of information is esp. helpful to the  first-time traveler to Great Britain.  In addition, the book gets updated  *annually* so (as far as I can tell) the information is very accurate.<br />I  think I have become a Rick Steves fan.  I'll definitely buy his other  travel books in the future.	2000-04-27

(For Dummies (Lifestyles Paperback))	Books	4	48	53	N	N	A Good Way to Start Learning About Law	This is one of the &quot;how-to&quot; books that are fun to read even if you are not faced with a situation which requires it.  This well-written book covers a wide range of legal topics that an American citizen may face one of these days.  Much emphasis is placed on things like marital  problems, parenting problems, employment issues, consumer and credit  problems, etc.  Needless to say it does NOT replace a good lawyer when the  case is complex, but the author actually encourages you to &quot;take the  law into your own hand&quot; and shows you how you can solve a number of  everyday legal difficulties without hiring a lawyer.<br />This book cannot  claim to be a complete guide to being your own lawyer or recognizing your  legal rights or duties, but I found it a terrific first-step book to read  about our great legal system.	2000-04-27

I picked up this book because I was about to negotiate a venture funding deal for a company.  Boy was this book helpful!  From how to best prepare for the negotiation to how to gain respect from your opponent to how to actually handle the negotiation, the author explains the subject with  enthusiasm and humor.  Lots and lots of examples make the subject matter  easy to understand.<br />That the author emphasizes that negotiation is not  just for &quot;big deals&quot; but for everyday living makes this book more  valuable.  I have re-read this book three times and continue to learn  tremendously.  I esp. enjoy the chapter on &quot;insider&quot; techniques.  These pro secrets sound so simple yet how many of us really follow them?  Again, the everyday examples enable the reader to immediately apply these  techniques to all kinds of negotiations, big or small.<br />My only complaint  is that there are quite a large number of grammatical and word usage  errors.	2000-04-27

(I don't know if a gamer using the standard version would need more info that this book provides.)  It picks up where the Pro user's guide left off, by showing you how to fly the planes like a  real pilot.  The book is a pleasure to read, as flying details are  explained clearly.  And the price is just right! :)	2000-04-27

Gates six years ago and he came across as very smart and very down-to-earth.  This book captures the thoughts and actions of this genius very well.  It's easy and pleasant to read, unlike other  boring biographies (and Gates' own books :).  I think it also gives the  readers plenty to think about.	2000-04-07
US	52340667	R1ACN6PH8Q9TVS	0782124488	743907035	Mastering Windows 2000 Professional	Books	4	32	33	N	N	The right book for the layman	I disagree with the first reviewer's assessment. This book is quite good and useful. It's more than a rehash of the win2k online manual or any other book (as far as I know). Instead it contains good, practical information  you can use every day.<br />I got this book last night and read most of it in  24 hours. I still like the &quot;Windows 2000: The Complete Reference&quot;  better for its clarity and technical accuracy, but if you are not into  technical details this book (Mastering Windows 2000 Pro) may be for you.  From setting up win2k to using win2k (who still can't use Windows?) to  trouble-shooting win2k, the information is all there, and the book makes a  good read from cover to cover as the authors write very succinctly.<br />If  you are just a user, as opposed to a technician or sysadm, this book is  about right to get you started on win2k.  I love win2k for its performance  and reliability (not a single crash so far!), and this book makes an  excellent companion.  (If you need more in-depth coverage, Windows 2000:  The complete Reference is worth checking out.)	2000-03-23

It's really for sysadms and webmasters, so it focuses on how to find and patch holes in a variety of systems/protocols: TCP/IP, Netware, NT, Unix, HTTP, etc.<br />By  now the book is quite out-dated (there's a chapter on S-HTTP!), but the  information on TCP/IP, Netware, etc. is still good, and it does a decent  job at explaining how to reduce your chance of getting hacked through the  use of firewalls and other tools.  My main gripe is that everything reads  rather like taken out of some other textbooks of computer science.  While  the book is well organized, the writer is not very good at explaining many  details, and there are quite a few glaring errors in almost every  chapter.<br />This book is now out of print; I hope this means a new edition  is imminent.  I'd love to check out the new edition.  For now, if you can  find a copy of this book, it's probably worth giving it a quick read.	2000-03-21

Screenshots and procedures are described in  lucid details, and notes and tips are easy to spot and mark.  From Win2k  architecture to installation pains to setting up every aspect of the  system, the book shines in leading you through every complex process.<br />My  only gripe about the book (and other Complete Refrence titles) is the book  cover, which curls easily in humidity.	2000-03-21

The way the Japanese army soldiers (many of whom, I  should point out, came from Korea and Taiwan) committed the atrocities were  simply unheard of.  Having lived in Japan for a few years, I can clearly  see how the Japanese mentality is pre-disposed toward cruelty -- just  witness all the S&amp;M movies out of Japan, which are ten times as sick as  anything you find here in America.	2000-03-21

The three parts of the book deal with design basics (images, types, layout, etc.), actual page building (personal, e-commerce, ...), and CSS.  Written in a lucid style,  the book is a pleasure to read and follow.  I'm graphically deprived, but  even I found the book very helpful and enlightening.  I'd still hire a good  professional (such as Mr Siegel himself) to do the job right, but the book  has shown me how to put together a better personal homepage.<br />All this  book needs to get 5 stars is an updated edition.  This 2nd edition was  published way back in 1997!  A bit too old, but again, still useful.	2000-03-18
US	52340667	R1BZOZL8TTQXM9	1574101250	605355777	How To Form Your Own Corporation Without a Lawyer for Under $75.00	Books	1	33	36	N	Y	Just forms, which can be obtained for free	This book is horrible.  First it focuses on incorporating in Delaware, and gives you most of the necessary forms for that state as well as basic forms 40 other states (no explanation why 9 states were excluded).  These forms  and instructions are all downloadable from the states' Web sites anyway, so  this book is pretty much useless.<br />The book also promotes the author's  company, which charges very high fees for simple incorporating  services.<br />If you need sample bylaws, etc, get them from &quot;Small  Business Kit for Dummies,&quot; which has much, much more useful  information and many other forms you can use.  Don't waste your money on  this book like I did.	2000-01-19

Books	5	177	179	N	Y	Extremely Helpful for Everyday Chores	Initially I was confused over how this book would be different from &quot;Small Business for Dummies.&quot;  Now I think I know.  This book focuses on the everyday chores of starting, funding and running a small business, and gives you lots of legal forms which you can use in order to  save money on attorney fees.  I find the forms on the CD-ROM extremely  useful and helpful.<br />The book does NOT talk about business ideas or  marketing.  It approaches the small business from a legal standpoint.  For  example, how do you talk to venture capitalists?  How do you give employees  stock options (incredible info in the book!)?  How do you deal with  employee discontent?  How to protect your business legally?  How to write a  contract?  And so on.<br />If you need to know how to get a small biz idea or  how to sell your products/services, this book is not for you.  But, once  you get your idea off the ground, you ABSOLUTELY NEED this book to survive  -- unless you've got lots of cash to afford a good attorney.  This book is  no substtitute for a lawyer in many situations, but I have been able to use  the forms in the book and on the accompanying CD-ROM to save my company  thousands of dollars.  I think this is a must-have reference for every  small business owner.<br />I wish IDG would put out an updated edition soon.	2000-01-09

I'm rather disappointed.  I hoped there would be some real slangy stuff, but found little.  The phrases, while useful, are too  &quot;lame&quot; to use in the real world.  Also, some of my Japanese  friends found many phrases in the book &quot;funny&quot;: they are not  really used very often even in the situation purported.<br />Anyway, the book  is easy to carry and can be a good guide to some useful phrases.  I just  wish the authors had chosen more real-world material.	2000-01-08

Obviously it won't make you successful, but it will keep you sane over the many little details of running a business, esp. an online business.  Written in easy-to-understand language, the book is highly readable and the  information highly useful and also up-to-date.  The small physical format  also makes it easy to carry around and read it any time.<br />The book covers  things like how to prepare to do business online (what business to go into,  financing, etc.), getting online (hosting, domain...), promoting online,  etc.  There are many tips provided in the margins.	1999-12-29

The presentation is extremely unclear and there are a lot of omissions in the main text (like, what on  earth is an RBI?).  After I read the book I still felt like a virgin, so I  bought a copy of &quot;Complete Idiot's Guide for Baseball,&quot; which is  much better and cheaper, too.	1999-08-04
