Erin McGraw is a notch above this fray. She is plain spoken in her style. She is sharp in her delivery. Her stories are great moments.  You could learn a lot by reading her stories. The first thing you'd learn is what great writing looks like in book form.<BR>It's dumb, base and so very Hemingway of me, but; when reading her stuff, I think about bullfighting. What's up with that? Read this book and tell me. I want to know.	2002-08-01

This stuff is great and I like the way it has been put together. It's a fun, loose design balanced by elegantly composed and seen photographs. Most of his books have been very clean from start to finish. That wouldn't be good for this project.<br />This work is wet and playful without losing all the good stuff.

He's doing crazy things to an image and the results are great.  The subject matter here moves from iconographic images of he US, sunken ships in Southeast Asia, to impressionistic nudes. The great thing about him is none of these images have been digitally manipulated. If you are a photographer and looking for a book to shake things up a bit, James Fee will not dissapoint. What makes this book succeed is that it's not just about the process, there is a real communication happening. I keep coming back to the book for ideas and inspiration. Owning this book will only do good things for you.	2001-10-29

There's nothing wrong with mining old images and putting them in a book, but this is getting a little crazy. <BR>Great images but if you have his other books, save you're money.

This is a great challenge and he meets it well.  The more I look at this book, the more unfolds for me. These are dense, graceful photos from around the world.  He uses cross processing, black and white and simple color with the eye of a real master.  There are a collection of short stories which I have not read yet,  but anything with Nick Cave in it, gets my money. For a first book, this is a keeper.	2001-06-08

He has the captain's hat, blue blazer, white pants, and a red sparkled speedboat with no motor. If you buy all of his books, Keith can go boating on the water instead of his driveway. His lips are swollen from making that motorboat sound. His wife is tired of spraying the hose at him to simulate waves.  The neighbors are starting to talk. You will not regret owning this book. It's well designed and full of  terrific images.  Remember to get the rest of his books and unleash Keith on the water's of Beaumont,Texas.	2001-05-24

It is used in every basic photo classroom  I've seen from high school to college. It is clear and concise. It is what is says it is: a basic manual. If you are just getting into photography, this book is for you. This book is not intimidating or unclear, the illustrations really help explain the text.

I found that flipping through this book became boring. After a while, seeing the same woman with her legs around her ears starts to get old. I guess that's what marriage is all about, but I'm not married to her. My real complaint is the over abundance of simaler images. Some of these pictures are better than the others. She's a beautiful woman, but less is more.	2001-05-21

I then found out that a bunch were ambrotypes. That's pretty cool, but they don't knock me out. Lots of nudes and flowers (some nudes and flowers in the same picture) and it starts to get repetitive. Aside from the process, the subject matter has been done and he is not breaking new ground. I like his editorial work. He is a gifted photographer and works very hard. This is a book of cash cows. If you have to buy this book, go ahead. You'll get bored with it after a while....	2001-05-10

This is Richard working in his element and at the height of his career.  It is a must for any portrait photographer.	2001-04-01

Looking at horses through Keith's eyes makes me love them. I'm not going to run out and buy tight pants and a helmet because of this book, but you get the idea. The images are well made and seen. Not all of the pictures have the tilt-shift look which has been overdone so that's good. The layout is great. A square book for a square image.   Keith's little ditty about Ezekiel's Horse is a warm piece of writing.  If you're a Keith Carter fan, buy the book. If you like horses, buy the book. If your interested in photography, buy the book. If your name is Mr. Ed, look for your portrait on page 29, then call your lawyer.	2000-12-02

The idea is a  lot of fun (getting women to flash the camera) and we should all be so  lucky. Most of his subjest looks like they have done this sort of thing  before. Most of the photos look too posed and wooden.  Also, they go  topless in France at the beach. Heck, look at the French franc note.  There's a nice pair and it's legal tender. In short, Franch women don't  have the same hang up about boobies that we do. This isn't a huge strech  for them.	2000-07-09

I picked up this book and enjoyed the fun anecdotes and sexy pics. I laughed out loud and connected with a lot of his memories. Later I found out that the photos were fakes. Who cares?  These are good pictures and don't look staged at all. That speaks to his talent as a photographer.

If your African beans are in trouble, look no further for an answer.  I did find some serious shortcomings though. For one, the car chases were totally  unrealistic. Everybody knows that a '69 Charger can outrun even the  speediest of Rickshaw drivers.  I thought the KGB agents were  too wooden  and contrived. Also, there is no real evidence of Black mountain gorillas  being able to type (until now). In spite of that, this is a well researched  and elegantly written tome.  Purchase it and enjoy	2000-06-21

The images are washed out and the intended high-key feel gets run over by flat reproductions.  This book is a fashion photograpgher's attempt to show potential clients that he can get a  book published and has seen lots of famous models naked. It is not art but  strictly commerce. The photos are not that good. There is no deeper concept  working here. I found myself flipping through the book waiting for  something to catch my eye.  The only interesting thing about this book is... There are great books on  this subject matter out there. Don't let the minimalist italian design fool  you into thinking this is one of them.  This is the iceberg lettuce of the  fashion/nude photo books.	2000-03-17

Steven Barker went into the sex clubs of NYC and documented what happens there. Using only avalible light, the long shutter speeds transform human figures into shadow creatures and smoke  shapes. Grainy, impressionistic photos are hobbled by a heavy handed design  layout. It seems that some pictures were picked not on their strength but  on the ability to fill empty space. I waited a long time for this book to  come out and was disappointed with the product. I wouldn't buy this if I  was able to flip through it  beforehand. It's too bad because what  intriqued me about this book was the subject matter and the mysterious  world therein. What I got was overdone, dilluted, and, dull.	2000-03-02

Keith Carter has photograpghed his east Texas homeland with respect and love. The land is rich and full of stories. Who are these people? Where is this place? What is going on here? Why did he make this picture? These are the  questions you ask when you move through the Carter landscape.  Keith has  turned his eye towards simple, beautiful things and people. His compostions  are full of air and earth. You can revisit this work over and over, pulling  out more thread with each turn. If you like Keith Carter, you should get  this book. If you don't know anything about him, get this book because it's  an earlier book and his eyes change over time. This is the dense taproot.  From here all else blooms.	2000-02-24

Keith's images move deep under the surface. This book is Keith at the height of his powers. Keith probes the spritual world of his home waters with a poet's eye.  The only hang-up I  have with the book is when he photos are cropped and don't show borders. If  he wanted them that way, he'd make borderless prints. Oh well, there're  worse things to complain about. These pictures move deep. There is some  tough imagery here. You won't get it on the first swing but keep with it .

These images are testament to that fact and if you can find this book, buy it without blinking. Image quality aside, this book is very  well made in every way. The quality of the paper and printing is of a  quality I have only rarely seen in photo books. Only 2,500 copies were  printed and snapped up faster than you can say Jack Robinson. This is an  amazing example of what photo books can be. It is a wonderful addition to  any collection. Happy hunting for it.  I bought mine from a gallery which  sells his photos.

It seems that he got a little looser in the 80's which works for me. Still, his work never strays from the spare design style which made him  the hot ticket. This book does not make me want to run out and take  pictures. I wonder about his lighting more than anything. These photos are  paradigms of design and composition but not much beyond that. This is a  great textbook for the advertising photographer. What worked then can work  now. I would be very interested seeing what Hiro is producing now. Hiro,  Hiro where are you?	2000-02-03

This is a book about us and our own relationships with ourselves and each other. Sometimes, you need to look elsewhere to find yourself.

Keith has really hit the ball out of the  park with this book. Go fetch (Oh ha, ha, ha!)! Just put the book in your  shopping cart and don't look back.
