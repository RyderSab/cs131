This one is a gem.  The concise text introduces several key concepts of Qabbalistic thought.  Like all the books in Thames & Hudson's \\"Art & Imagination\\" series, this one is profusely illustrated ---- after 30 pages of text are 60 pages of pictures & diagrams, all amply explained in accompanying notes.  Most of the diagrams have the original Hebrew writing, so this book is a tremendous resource for anyone who reads Hebrew.  In particular, I am a big fan of the \\"extended Tree of Life\\" diagram on p. 41, showing how the Sefirot play out in the worlds of Azilut, Beriah, Asiyyah, and Yesirah; I have never seen such a detailed diagram of this anywhere else.  Between the text and the notes accompanying the diagrams, Halevi makes clear the scriptual origins of the Qabbalah, the beliefs & practices, as well as the influence of the Qabbalah on non-Jewish traditions.  I think this book is a wonderful introduction for a modern reader seeking an \\"in\\" on the Qabbalah.  Even after reading other books, I find myself going back to this book again and again.  It is a treasure.	2005-07-06

This book is remarkable in that it brings those many stories together in one place.  By focusing a book on the theme of \\"death stories\\", the stories illumine each other, and the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.  The stories reveal a wonderfully refreshing way to think about death (and hence, to think about Life!)  Many are solemn, but some are quite humorous.  In each, we see the presence of someone who embraces all of human experience, who says \\"Yes!\\" to all of Life, including death.  Many of the Masters give one final gem of wisdom, summarizing their life's teaching, as their last word.  The many photographs of the Masters are heart-warming.  For anyone ready to think about death and mortality in terms of their spritual meaning, this book is ideal.  Ironically, through looking at how the Masters die, we can implicitly understand their teaching on how to be ever more fully alive.	2005-07-06

I have never seen so much about the inner meaning of the Yijing explained so clearly.  Here the reader will find illumination about the He Tu (\\"The Yellow River Map\\"), the Lo Shu (\\"The Lo River Writing\\"), lines that are \\"central\\" and \\"correct\\" (aka \\"Governing\\" and \\"Constituting\\" rulers), the nuances of different judgements, and numerous traditional Yijing diagrams.  Everything that is most obscure in, for example, the Wilhelm-Baynes \\"I Ching\\" is made clear here.  Again, this book might be hopelessly confusing for someone new to the Yijing, but for someone who has spent time working with the oracle and who wants to deepen a relationship with it, I can think of no better book than this.	2005-07-06

She is a Jungian who teaches in SF. This is a book written by an intelligent and empowered woman, in an attempt to give other women insight on their own strengths & inner gifts.  She weaves the stories of 7 goddess of classical Greece (Athena, Artemis, Hestia, Hera, Demeter, Persephone, and Aphrodite) with observations of emotional & behavioral patterns culled from her years of clinical work.  The result are truly compelling portraits --- almost every women will find at least one \\"aha!\\" of recognition in this book, and all of us can find some kind of \\"aha!\\" for the women dear to us in our lives.  By casting these behavioral patterns as *goddesses*, Dr. Bolen is ennobling the internal & external struggles of women and underscoring their inherent strength & wisdom.  It is a book of tremendous optimism, courage, and hope.  This is a book I have often given as a gift to women, especially young women.	2005-01-27

Dunham does a wonderful job in this whirlwind tour of the past two thousand years of mathematics.  He presents math as a story of triumph after triumph.  Each chapter highlights one &quot;great&quot; theorem, and in every chapter he makes clear the context of the theorem by discussing preceding work, the life of the mathematician who proved the theorem, and the applications it opened up.  He is masterful at mentioning tidbits in historical context that will be logically necessary to understand a few chapters further.  No advanced knowledge of math is necessary, but I will caution: one must be at least reasonably fluent in both geometry and second year algebra in order to get the most out of this book.  The more rusty one's algebra skills are, the more burdensome the proofs will be.  For someone comfortable with that level of math, the book is breathtaking in the panoply of intellectual vistas it opens up.  For anyone doing any kind of work in any technical field, I simply cannot recommend this book highly enough.	2003-08-24

St. Benedict (480 - 543), really the designer of monasticism as it existed in the Western World, wrote his Rule to guide monks through a life of discipline to spiritual realization.  There's a great deal of wisdom on that rule, but unfortunately much of it is inaccessable to secular people in the 20th century --- many of us are not strictly Christian these days, most of us not monks or nuns,  we live in a much more complex world than existed in the 6th century, etc.<br />A couple years ago, John McQuiston apparently set out on a search for spiritual principles by which to live in everyday life.  He found the Rule of Benedict, and recognizing it's inherent wisdom despite the limitations of its original assumed context.  He &quot;translated&quot; the Rule, changing Christian symbols to more universal images, changing allusions to monastic asceticisms to analogous practices possible in the modern secular world.  The result is an extremely accessible text that transmits (I think) the core values of St. Benedict's message, values that lead us from a self-centeredness &amp; entrapment in the contingencies of daily life to expansion, clarity, and connection with meaning &amp; Mystery.<br />The book is small --- each &quot;chapter&quot; really only takes a minute or two to read, so I have been finding it very helpful as a reflection before meditating, before going to bed, etc.  I have also been find that these tiny sections reveal more and more upon rereading.  I love this book because, on the one hand, it's not &quot;more to read&quot; in the sense of some onerous task, and yet each small investment of time pays richly in inspiring themes on which to reflect for days.  It is idea for any busy person in the modern world seeking a life of greater depth and meaning.	2003-03-14

This is one of my favorite books, and one I recommend often to friends.  It's topic are the chakras, the seven energy centers of the human body.  After an introductory chapter, it devotes a chapter to each chakra in depth.  Unlike so many other books about chakras, though, this book does NOT just talk &amp; talk &amp; talk about them.  Talk feeds the head, and the chakras are about whole-body experience: being able to give a precise verbal definition of the third chakra is NOT at all the same as having a healthy third chakra!  This book thoroughly acknowledges that, and for each chakra, recommends a wealth of approaches --- including word association exercises, journal exercises, yogic stretches &amp; exercises (all illustrated with photographs), partner bodywork (again, photographs), and sacred rituals --- for each chakra.  Because of the richness and depth of the treatment of each chakra, this book is ideal for someone quite experienced in energetic bodywork as well as for someone who barely knows what a &quot;chakra&quot; is.  It can be read cover to cover, or can be consulted as a reference book when issues arise with a particular chakra.  If you follow the program they lay out, doing all the exercises for all the chakras, there is almost no way you could avoid experiencing some measure of personal growth and transformation.  I can think of no other book that better deserves the epiteth of &quot;User Manual for the Human Body.&quot;  I highly recommend this book.	2002-04-07

Marshall argues that the central text, the &quot;Zhouyi&quot;, contains identifiable historical references to events in ancient China.  Specifically, Marshall argues that the date of the Conquest of the Shang Dynasty by what would become the Zhou Dynasty can be located in the year 1070 BCE, on the basis of evidence in the &quot;Zhouyi&quot; --- including a hitherto undetected reference to a solar eclipse in the text of Hexagram #55!  In the course of his argument, he brings to life the semi-mythical figures of King Wen &amp; King Wu (virtuous founders of the Zhou Dynasty) and Zhou Xin (depraved tyrant, last Shang ruler).  He cogently suggests specific links between Shang bone oracles and the text of the &quot;Zhouyi&quot;.  By citing Chinese characters in the text, and providing a glossary of them in the back, he allows the reader to feel a part of the detective work he is doing.  Overall, I enthusiastically recommend this book to anyone with an interest in ancient China and to anyone who works seriously with the *I Ching*.  The former will find historical bases for figures often dismissed as mythological, while the latter will find profoundly meaning depth in some of the *I Ching's* inscrutable phrases.	2001-11-25

In the central part of the book, Alex Grey presents the human being layer by layer.  Starting with the skeleton, he adds the nervous &amp; circulatory systems, the viscera, the musculature, and finally the skin.  Materialist would stop there.  But Alex Grey has the eyes of a mystic, and continues to depict the etheric &amp; energetic components of humanity, right up to the Void of pure consciousness.  He also includes deities from east &amp; west, showing that they too &quot;mirror&quot; what we are in our depths.  Many of the later frames are suitable as objects of meditation. The most talented energy-healer I know seems to know everything about people just by looking at them, and she says what she sees is what Alex Grey paints.  This book contains art that can put a person in touch with her deepest and noblest possibilities.  This book is nothing less than a gift to the human race!	2001-11-25

Literature scholars universally recognize Eliot's &quot;Waste Land&quot; as one of the most influential poems of the 20th century.  The poem draws on a wealth of images, everything from classics of Western literature to Tarot cards, from anthropology to Eastern sacred texts.  The title refers to the barren land of the Fisher King in Arthurian legend; both the king and the land eventually find redemption through the Holy Grail.  Through a masterful use of language and symbols, Eliot brilliantly portrays the problem of meaning in the modern world --- and the way to deeper meaning!<br />Unfortunately, many of Eliot's references are arcane, and not easy for the lay reader to pursue.  For example, few modern readers happen to have a copy of Webster's play &quot;White Devil&quot; or excerpts from Shackleton's account of the Antarctic expedition readily available on their shelves.  Hence, the virtue of this particular edition: in addition to Eliot's original poem and original notes, this book includes the relevant passages from every single work Eliot quotes in the &quot;Wasteland&quot;, all translated into English.  For the first time I have seen in print, this book allows the reader to understand this magnificent poem in light of the full scope of its allusions.  A triumphant achievement!	2001-04-16

The authors, Lama Yeshe and Lama Zopa Rinpoche, present the material in a clear logical way that immediately rings true.  They are empirical and scientific in their approach, even comparing Buddhist inquiry about the nature of self to a scientific investigation.  Their refrain throughout the books is \\"check it out\\" --- verify for yourself, in your own practice, that their observations are true.  They are not preaching dogma: quite to the contrary, they are proposing \\"testable hypotheses\\" of inner life, and they suggest inner \\"experiments\\" for the reader to carry out.  The analyses are precise, and yet the precision is conveyed without jargon.  This book is profoundly accessible to the modern Western reader, particularly to someone who has a background in science.  Because of the cogency of the arguments, I would recommend this book not only to students of Buddhism and comparative religion, but also to students of philosophy, psychology, anthropology --- anyone who uses rational and scientific investigation to explore human nature in an attempt to ameliorate human problems.	2001-04-01

This book is truly full of gems, each replete with Wisdom.  This is a translation of a concise work by the 7th Dalai Lama (1708-1757).  After a brief invocation, the work consists of 108 stanzas, each in the form of a metaphorical question (sometime quite colorful) and an answer.  For example: &quot;#28 What is the body odor/ easy to acquire by hard to lose?/ Habits picked up from people/ whose lives are far from spiritual ways.&quot;  In this question and answer form, the 7th Dalai Lama covers all the basics of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition.  Mullin's translation has one stanza on a page, followed by a thoughtful commentary, including explanation of the more obscure metaphors.  The book can be read in a few ways.  One can easily read through the 108 stanza in a single sitting, glancing down occasionally at the commentary to shed light on an arcane reference. On a first reading, that mode may be preferable to reading every word on every page, because it quickly gives a sense of the whole.  Any single stanza, with or without accompanying commentary, makes an excellent inspirational reading before meditation or before retiring to sleep.  Opening this book to a random page would be an excellent form of \\"dharma divination.\\"  Because of the brevity of the root text and the brilliance of Mullin's organization of the book as a whole, this is a book that can read in a variety of ways, over and over again.  Mullin has done a truly spectacular job of making this timeless wisdom so readily accessible to the modern reader.  Furthermore, Mullin's detailed introduction gives a brief but clear synopsis of the role of the first seven Dalai Lamas in Tibetan history.  I cannot praise Mullin's work on this book highly enough.  I would enthusiastically recommend this book to anyone at any stage of any spiritual path.	2001-04-01

(1) &quot;Change is a teacher without peer.&quot;  (p. 71)(2) &quot;It is an unspoken trust that carries and supports us as we strive for the power and virtue to become who we are meant to be.&quot; (p. 110)  Those two may give you a sense of the profound wisdom made available in this text.  Much of the original text is somewhat hard to understand, at least on a first reading, although Karcher's translation &amp; commentaries are radiant with clarity.  The text, in its discussion of the Way (Tao) and Change, explains the spiritual/metaphysical mechanisms underlying the *I Ching*; familiarity with the *I Ching* makes this text much more accessible, although the wisdom of this text may entice some readers to work more closely with the *I Ching*.  Karcher (who, with Ritsema, did one of the most brilliant English translations of the *I Ching* ever) is deeply familiar with that work, and thus is able to bring those insights to this work.  This is a book one could read again and again over the years, learning more on each reading.  As if the merits of the text were not enough to recommend this book on its own, the design of the book (with small photos &amp; Chinese characters in the margins) is stunningly beautiful.  This book would be particularly wonderful for the aesthetically sensitive spiritual aspirant.	2000-12-26

It is very dangerous when a wound is so common in culture that hardly anyone knows there is a problem.&quot;  Johnson opens his book with these provocative sentences.  The first thing he does is convince the reader that the problem exists, and is of considerable scope.  For example, our modern English language is not really adequate for a full description of the problem, having the vague and much abused word &quot;feeling&quot; and only one word, equally vague, for &quot;love&quot;.  Johnson, a Jungian analyst, explores the problem using myths -- the Fisher King and the Handless Maiden, to demonstrate the wounded feeling function in, respectively, masculinity and femininity.  Through the myths, Johnson not only diagnoses the problem, but makes practical suggestions for healing.  This wonderful little book, scarcely 100 pages long, can be read in an afternoon, although its insights could change the directions of a life.	2000-09-24

In tradition Hindu society, there are four answers - the right one depends on your stage in life.  These four  goals are: (1) *dharma* -- virtue, duty; (2) *artha* -- success, wealth,  family life; (3) *kama* -- pleasure, sexuality, sensual enjoyment; and (4)  *moksha* -- total spiritual liberation.  Alain Danielou, one of the  greatest scholars of ancient India, discusses the implications of a society  based on these four goals.  Danielou argues persuasively that this  four-thousand year old system of the Four Aims of Life gives us deep  insight into human nature, a level of insight sadly lacking in many modern  conceptions.  This small book is brief and clear, an accessible  introduction for someone not familiar with Hinduism or traditional Indian  society.

How do we think about death in the modern  secular world?  The pre-eminent psychologist Robert Jay Lifton thinks that  is one of the most important questions facing us today.  This book looks at  the question of death in the big picture.  In the first part of the book,  he traces individual development, and shows how the idea of death develops  with the individual.  In part two, he looks at the relationship of death to  various emotions and to psychological disorders.  In part three, he looks  at the global picture, discussing what it means to live in a world with  nuclear arms; here he cites from his extensive personal research with the  survivors of Hiroshima.  As Lifton argues, \\"We must open ourselves to the  full impact of death in order to rediscover and reinterpret the movement  and sequence of life\\" (p. 52).

Whereas  individual of the past could orient their lives within the framework of  absolutes recognized by their cultures, we are cut adrift in an  ever-changing sea.  Yet, we survive and thrive.  How?  Dr. Robert Jay  Lifton explains in this book.  He describes \\"proteanism\\", the individual's  ability to re-create himself as exterior conditions demand it, just as the  ancient Greek god Proteus could shapeshift as needed.  For anyone grappling  with constructing a meaningful life within the rapid changes of the modern  world, this might be the best book ever written.	2000-08-11

In Vaishnava  Hinduism, Vishnu is honored with hundreds of names. In this book, Easwaran  explores over a hundred of these names with simple reflections.  For each  one, he gives the Sanskrit name and its translation, and then he writes a  short piece about seeing that aspect of the sacred in everyday life.  As is  typical in Hinduism, there is a dizzying variety of names here, from  BHUTA-KRIT (\\"The Support of All Creatures\\") to KESHAVA (\\"He Who Has  Beautiful Hair\\").  Vishnu is LAKSHMI (\\"Good Fortune\\") as well as BHAGA-HA  (\\"Destroyer of Good Fortune\\").  Easwaran's reflections are helpful in  appreciating the presence of the Sacred throughout the full spectrum of  experiences in everyday life.  This book is a magical tour of the  archetypal manifestations of the Sacred.	2000-08-11

He  also presents the guiding metaphor of the book, the \\"wilderness\\" of dreams,  indicating that while several \\"explorers\\" have come back from there with  \\"maps\\", the territory is still not known  -- and thus is open to  interpretation.  In Part Two, he summarizes some of those \\"explorers\\",  twentieth century writers who have put forth theories of dreams  interpretation; these include Freud and Jung, the surrealist Andre Breton,  the neurobiologist J. Allen Hobson, the lucid dream advocate Stephen  LaBerge, the anthropologist Barbara Tedlock, and the cognitive psychologist  Harry Hunt.  The variety of possible interpretations leads nicely into Part  Three, where Bulkeley introduces hermeneutical theory to defend, as it  were, the wilderness from the writers who would claim that it is \\"known\\".  Indeed, he shows that none of the previously cited interpretations of  dreams is complete and satisfying in and of itself.  In Part Four, building  on the work of Lakoff and Johnson, Bulkeley introduces the concept of a  \\"root metaphor.\\"  As he explains: \\"Root metaphors are metaphors that  express our ultimate existential concerns; root metaphors provide religious  meanings that orient our lives\\" (p. 145).  From there, he reveals his  masterstroke: \\"dreams are our primary source of root metaphors\\" (p. 151).  He goes back to each of the previously discussed theories of dream  interpretation and re-analyzes them in terms of root metaphors, and then  shows how to work with dreams using the idea of root metaphors.  In Part  Five, in light of the increasing secularization of the modern world, he  argues that one antidote would be a more prominent place for dreams and  dreamwork in our lives.

Based on the ancient  Chinese philosophy of Yin and Yang, it provides timeless wisdom about how  to negotiate the changing nature of events.  In seventeenth century China,  the Buddhist commentator Chih-hsu Ou-i (1599-1655) wrote a Buddhist version  of the *I Ching*; this book is a translation of Chih-hsu's version of the  *I Ching*.  This version resonates with several streams of thought in  China: on the whole, it is deeply ethical in its outlook; at times, it  sounds a bit Taoist, and in other places, there are echoes of Zen.  Overall, there is a tremendous amount of wisdom in this book, for Chih-shu  was well-versed in the esoteric traditions of China.  The entire text is a  compassionate attempt to guide souls, through the ups and downs of a  changing world, to the ultimate goal of enlightenment.  The book may be  consulted for divination as an ordinary translation of the *I Ching* would  be, or it can be read from cover to cover.	2000-08-11

The most well known are the *Pert em hru* (\\"The Egyptian Book of the  Dead\\") and the *Bardo Th&ouml;dol* (\\"The Tibetan Book of the Dead\\").  In this  book, Stanislav Grof treats these, and also discusses Books of the Dead  from Mayan, Aztec, and Christian traditions.  Grof demonstrates the  parallels in these texts from different cultures, and then discusses  further parallels in his own scientific research on human consciousness.  Grof describes these texts as \\"accurate descriptions of the experiential  territories traversed in non-ordinary states of consciousness\\" (p. 31).  The images in part two, \\"Plates\\", and part three, \\"Themes\\", underscore the  similarities between culturally remote traditions.  Grof succeeds in  creating a powerful challenge and raising significant questions: if these  images represent interior \\"places\\" we can go, then what does that say about  how we should be living our lives?  In other words, Grof takes the attitude  of many of the ancient books of the dead - that the nature of death &amp;  the afterlife has implications about how human life should be lived - and  with the spin of his own consciousness studies, shows how that premise is  still valid in the modern world.  This is a visually engaging and deeply  thought-provoking book.	2000-08-11

This is readily apparent in ancient Egyptian  iconography, but for most people, those arcane symbols remain a closed  book.  Lucy Lamy's book is a masterpiece that opens these ancient vaults of  wisdom to the modern reader.  I found extraordinary spiritual insights in  what I have previously seen as a dry and opaque tradition.  After the essay  in part one, part two (\\"Plates\\") and part three (\\"Themes\\") present images  with text explaining where they fit into Ms. Lamy's analysis.

This  Jungian analysis of creation myths is one of her masterpieces.  In the  Jungian view, creation deals with the threshold between the conscious and  the Unconscious.  When we create a new \\"world\\" for ourselves (by a change  in job, relationship, residence, life-status, etc.), we are at this inner  threshold. This book uses images from ancient mythological systems to  illustrate how a psychologically healthy person approaches the creative  process.  Although the theme may initially seem esoteric, the author is  discussing issues that strike us all at our core.	2000-08-11

It traces his life and professional development, drawing on letters and  extensive quotes from the Collected Works.  It is profusely illustrated,  not only with photographs of Jung and the relevant people and places in his  life, but also with his drawings.  After Jung's break with Freud in the  early 1910's, Jung went through a about a decade of professional isolation  and rich personal growth.  During that time, he kept a journal called the  \\"Red Book\\", which he decorated with drawing and paintings based on his  dreams and active imagination.  Many striking images from the Red Book are  reproduced in this volume: a drawing of Philemon, Jung's inner spiritual  guide; the viscerally disquieting \\"Meeting with the Shadow\\"; and a  singularly captivating image, \\"The Light at the Heart of Darkness\\".  Photos  of Jung in his travels and at his house in Bollingen round out this  engaging visual tour of Jung's contribution.

In Jung's  psychology, the \\"feminine\\" can mean several things, including: (1) the  consciousness of real females; (2) an aspect of the Unconscious in males  called the \\"anima\\"; and (3) an archetype of the creative matrix of  existence in all human beings.  The writings in this volume discuss  principally the second and third of those.  These selections are in  chronological order, so one can trace the development of Jung's ideas.   Several mention the interactions of \\"anima\\" and \\"animus\\" (the unconscious  contrasexual elements, in men and women respectively, which play a vital  role in both romance and spiritual unfolding) - indeed, that is the main  subject of the earlier selection from \\"Relations of the Ego and  Unconscious\\" (1928) as well as the closing selection from \\"Aion\\" (1959).   The long central selection, \\"Psychological Aspects of the Mother  Archetype\\", and \\"The Psychological Aspects of the Kore\\" both use mythology  to illustrate what Jung saw as fundamental psychological issues for all  human beings. This book would be disappointing for someone looking  specifically for writings on women's issues; however, anima &amp; animus  are central ideas in Jung's conception of gender relations, and his  clearest expositions of those subjects are collected here.

For Jung, transference was  about a person's relation with his or her Unconscious, and the spectrum of  possible relationships extends from delusion to liberating insight.  Thus,  transference is not just about the patient's relationship to the therapist;  rather, transference is ultimately about the individual's relationship with  the whole of life.  After an introductory section, Jung frames his essay as  a commentary on the *Rosarium Philosophorum*, an alchemical text published  in 1550.  The text focuses on a series of ten drawings that will assuredly  appear bizarre to folks unfamiliar with alchemical symbols; however, Jung's  brilliant analysis demonstrates that these apparently monstrous images  actually map out, symbolically, that path to inner liberation.  Indeed,  this essay, late in Jung's career, represents him at the height of his  powers, synthesizing symbols from a variety of sources to create a text  dense with insights into the fundamental problems of human life.	2000-08-10

Unlike some of the other volumes in the  Collected Works, this is a not a single document, but rather a collection  of essays spanning four decades.  All of them are concerned with some  aspect of societal issues at large.  Jung writes about anthropology ancient  (\\"Archaic Man\\", 1931) and modern (\\"Woman in Europe\\", 1927).  His topic  range from the profoundly sober (\\"After the Catastrophe\\", 1945) to the  seemingly absurd (\\"Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth\\", 1958).  He explores  professional issues in \\"The State of Psychotherapy Today\\" (1934) and \\"The  Complications of America Psychology\\" (1959).  He explores the interfaces of  psychology with the moral (\\"Good and Evil in Analytic Psychology\\", 1959)  and the spiritual (\\"What India Can Teach Us\\", 1939).  In my mind, the gem  of the collection is \\"The Undiscovered Self (Present and Future)\\" (1957),  in which Jung explores the implications of psychological development, and  the lack thereof, on the broadest scale of history.  In Jung's view, the  configuration of the conscious and the unconscious is the most important  parameter in the life of an individual, and insofar as aspects of this  configuration are identical across individuals in a culture, these aspect  shape and constrain the development of the culture; that, in a nutshell, is  the topic of this book.	2000-08-10

In Jung's view, the person who does not know him or herself, who does not  understand his or her strengths as an individual, will necessarily fall  victim to mass-mentality.  Mass-mentality is the Unconscious played out on  the global scale, and if left to its own devices, it will continue to  produce tragedies similar in scale to what the human race experienced in  the two world wars.  The antidote, Jung argues, is self-knowledge.  This is  not philosophical self-knowledge, but rather psychological self-knowledge -  a reckoning with one's animal instincts, one's shadow, one's dreams and  fantasies.  Ultimately, Jung says self-knowledge must involve a spiritual  experience - an experience of tradition religious truths as relevant in  one's own life.  Only this kind of experience will protect a person from  the trap of mass-mentality; moreover, the development of culture and  perhaps even the survival of the race depend on such individuals who can  resist mass-mentality when it is strongest.  For Jung, the hope of the  human race and the world at large depended ultimately on the inner work  individuals do in their most intimate inner world.  For Jung, the personal  is the political, but in a much more profound way than that in which anyone  else has ever used that phrase.	2000-08-10

Furthermore,  this book would be of great interest to anyone looking at larger issues of  how the \\"feminine\\" is conceived across cultures and across time.	2000-08-10

The first half of the volume is a collection  of essays in which Jung explains his views about the interaction of a  therapist and a patient.  Two themes are striking.  First, Jung insists  that therapy is a mutual interaction, not something the therapist \\"does\\" to  the patient: \\"the therapist is no longer the agent of treatment but a  fellow participant in a process of individual development\\" (p. 8).  Secondly, Jung is iconoclastic and utterly unsystematic: for him, the  process of growth and healing is a process of individuation, so what is  needed for healing at each step of the psychotherapeutic process will be  unique to the individuals involved.  Jung borrows ideas from Freud, such as  dream-analysis and transference, but Freud would not even recognize the way  Jung uses these terms in this volume.  Indeed, the final work, \\"The  Psychology of the Transference\\" (1946), is one of his late alchemical  works; it uses the *Rosarium philosophorum*, a 16th century alchemical  text, as the basis for elucidating the spectrum of issues around an  individual's relationship with the Unconscious.  I suspect this volume  would be of particular interest to practicing therapists, because Jung  discusses the profound existential issues that are often overlooked in  current professional programs in psychology.	2000-08-10

In her opening essay, Getty discusses the ancient Goddess religions  and their spirituality of rebirth and regeneration.  She goes on to discuss  the \\"Patriarchal Inversion\\", but then demonstrates the ongoing presence of  the Goddess in ostensibly patriarchal religions - for example, in what she  calls \\"Unbidden Mariology\\" in the Christian tradition.  The essay closes  with considerations of what Goddess Religions might contribute to concerns  in the modern world.  The second part of the book, \\"Plates\\", and the third  part of the book, \\"Themes\\", present a bewildering array of Goddess images  from all over the world.  One can learn a great deal about the Goddess  simply from flipping through these pictures.  Overall, this is a very well  done synopsis of the Goddess across cultures and across time.	2000-08-10

For  those familiar with the *Tao Te Ching*, this translation will be  surprising.  The chapters are not in the original order, and a few  chapters, familiar from later versions, did not exist in this early  version.  Unlike most translations of this text, the first half of this  translation focuses on TE (which Mair translates as \\"integrity\\"), and the  second half focuses on TAO.  Thus, the famous opening line (here translated  as \\"The ways that can be walked are not the eternal Way\\") is found here as  the first line of chapter 45.  Mair provided extensive introduction,  annotations, and \\"Afterword\\".  Clearly, his primary concerns are  philological in nature.  While I would not recommend this to someone  reading the *Tao Te Ching* for the first time, this translation could be  quite helpful for someone comparing translations and trying to come to a  deeper understanding of the text.	2000-08-10

The contents of  this book would be somewhat surprising for someone expecting a book about  &quot;men's issues&quot;.  When Jung says the \\"masculine\\", he is thinking  about multiple interacting levels, including (1) the consciousness of real  men; (2) the \\"animus\\", or unconscious masculine, in real women; (3) the  hero myth; (4) the representations of \\"spirit\\" in myth; and (5) the  alchemical problem of the unification of opposites.  Some of these  selections focus on the role the father and the mother play in an  individual's psyche.  There is a whole section devoted to the animus (\\"The  Masculine in Women\\"), some of Jung's few statements specifically on the  psychology of women.  About a quarter of the selections are from Jung's  late writings, his extended psychological analysis of alchemy.  Only a rare  mind will understand these works on first reading; most folks will have to  delve deeper in Jung's psychology and then come back to these to fully  appreciate them.  Nevertheless, the selections of this volume may be an  excellent introduction to Jung's writings for someone already intrigued by  an \\"expanded\\" understanding of the masculine.	2000-08-10

This wonderful translation is  faithful to the brevity and concision of the original.  In each chapter,  the translators have selected one crucial line to represent in the original  Chinese characters down the side of the page.  That in and of itself would  be no more than quaint decoration for those of us who don't read classical  Mandarin; however, they also transliterate that line and place it side by  side with the English translation in the text.  Furthermore, the end of the  book contains a glossary of all these Chinese characters, showing the  various meanings of each one.  For example, at the beginning of chapter 15,  we find: \\"The ancients who followed TAO:/ Dark, wondrous, profound,  penetrating, / *Wei*, *miao*, *hs&uuml;an*, *t'ung*.\\"  Those four Chinese  characters are drawn on the side of the page.  Alternate meaning are given  in the glossary: for example, *wei* can mean \\"small, obscure, subtle,  dark\\".  Rather than translate those four characters into a flowery sentence  in an attempt to capture all the subtleties in English, these translators  empower the reader to do that work.  This book is a wonderful translation  for anyone who wants to do the work of really understanding what this  profound and insightful text has to say.	2000-08-10

Jung was extraordinarily well read in philosophy, comparative  religion &amp; mythology, and alchemy, and his works are dense with those  quotes.

In light  of recent neurobiological work on the origin and treatment of  schizophrenia, this primarily psychoanalytic approach to the condition will  seem passe, to say the least.  The practical value of these writing in the  treatment of persons suffering from schizophrenia is minimal.  The volume  would be most valuable for someone who wanted to understand the edifice of  Jungian thought as a whole; in that context, some of these writings, in  presenting Jung's understanding of the psyche as a dynamic system, would  elucidate further his remarks about archetypal psychology in other  writings.	2000-08-10

In  this selection of writings, mostly from Volume 11 of the Collected Works,  Jung focuses on the strengths and limitations of western religion.  For  Jung, western religion is the organic unity of Church Christianity and its  \\"shadows\\": Gnosticism and alchemy.  Two thirds of the book consist of two  long essays, \\"A Psychological Approach to the Dogma of the Trinity\\" (1942)  and \\"Transformation Symbolism in the Mass\\" (1942).  In these essays, as  well as the shorter ones, Jung walks a fine line.  His analysis could  scandalize a traditional (and otherwise unimaginative) Christian believer;  at the same time, Jung's profound respect for the depth and wisdom of  Christianity stands in stark contrast to the flippant disregard some  elements of the New Age movement pay it.  For Jung, Christianity (with its  shadows) is an organic system that contains, though sometimes in obscure  ways, everything needed for psychology growth and individuation.  For  anyone who was raised Christian but who now finds Christianity  unaccountably unsatisfactory, this book could catalyze renewed spiritual  explorations in any one of number of directions.	2000-08-10

They do a wonderful job of illuminating several traits unique to  Zen, not by explaining them discursively, but rather by providing one  illuminating story after another.  For example, type of guidance a novice  receives in Zen is virtually unparalleled in the world's spiritual systems.  An explanation of everything unique to it would most likely be arcane and  dry, hardly helpful to the outsider.  Instead, this book tells stories,  profound touchstones from the tradition.  My favorite entry from the  chapter \\"Skillful Guidance is a story about the interaction of the Zen  Master Nanquan (Japanese: Nansen, 748-835) and a hopeful pupil looking for  him.---  Nanquan was working on the mountain.  A monk came by and asked  him, \\"What is the way that leads to Nanquan?\\"  The master raised his sickle  and said, \\"I bought this sickle for thirty cents.\\"  The monk said, \\"I'm not  asking about the sickle you bought for thirty cents.  What is the way that  leads to Nanquan?\\"  The master said, \\"It feels good when I use it.\\" (p. 10)  --- One of the many virtues of that story is that, until our intuition  opens to it, we are very much like the monk in the story, and Nanquan is  teaching us as well.  As I read the book, I felt that I was being taught by  both ancient and modern Masters, and the miracle is, across thirteen  centuries, they speak with one voice.  Admittedly, not every selection will  make sense to the beginner on a first reading, but that is one of the  book's strengths - many passages become deeper with repeated readings.  This is not a once-through quick read; this is a text from which new  insights might emerge for years and years.  It is a book that challenges  you to grow, and it will remain relevant as you grow.  For this reason, I  recommend it not only to beginners, but to seasoned Zen practitioners as  well.ot only to beginners, but to seasoned Zen practitioners as  well.	2000-08-08

This is a book eminently designed  for those people. Stephen Mitchell's translation of the *Tao Te Ching* is  wonderful: straightforward, touching, and undeniably relevant to life in  the modern world.  His gender-inclusive language makes the text both more  approachable to modern American readers AND more resonant with Taoist  ideals.  While Mitchell's free style may offend linguistic purists - this  is a translation of the spirit more than the letter - he has made the  unifying ideas of the text clear.  This is a *Tao Te Ching* focused  consistently on the spiritual, on the higher possibilities of the human  being.  Yes, it's a fantastic translation, but why pay for the hard cover  edition when the paperback is cheaper?  Simply because this is a beautiful  book.  Its pages are made of rough-cut, high quality paper of exquisite  texture.  From a biblophilic standpoint, this is one of the most satisfying  books I have ever held in my hands.

By early eighteenth century, what was left of Zen in Japan wasn't  much.  But the strength of Zen is in the individuals, the truly liberated  spirits, it produces, and early eighteen century Japan saw one of the  greatest ever: Hakuin Zenji (1685-1768).  This book is a translation of  what is considered the most important text by this legendary exponent of  the Rinzai Zen tradition.  Hakuin was a man of high standards, and he had  little patience for the soft soothing \\"Zen\\" of his day.  He pulls no  punches in his criticism: \\"At present, this country is infested with a race  of smooth-tongued, worldly-wise Zen teachers who feed their students a  ration of utter nonsense\\" (pp. 24f); \\"Now that's not even good rubbish\\" (p.  52); \\"Phffmp! What graveyard did you pillage for those old left-over  offerings?\\" (p. 92).  (Waddell's lively translation contributes to one's  appreciation of this dynamic personality.)  For Hakuin, what was most  important was the breakthrough *kensho* experience, reached after years of  rigorous meditation practice; apart from *kensho*, the words and ideas of  Zen are worthless and meaningless. Hakuin's Zen represents a level of  authenticity consonant with the height of Zen in the T'ang Dynasty.  It is  a Zen that focuses on the central matter relentlessly, and has absolutely  no use for anything that serves to distract from this.  In this respect,  Hakuin's words may be a useful corrective to some of the more diffuse,  feel-good, self-satisfying elements of the New Age.  I would not  necessarily recommend this book to someone who knew nothing about Zen; at  least a cursory knowledge of classical Zen is useful in making sense of  Hakuin's many references to great Zen Masters of the past.  Not the best  starting book, but any serious study of Zen will eventually involve  confronting this fiercely determined defender of authentic Zen, and this  book is undoubtedly the best English introduction to Hakuin.best English introduction to Hakuin.	2000-08-08

Yes, the Five Houses, in the  second half of the T'ang Dynasty (619-906), came almost half a millennium  after Bodhidharma (470 - 543(?)), legendary founder of Zen.  But the Five  Houses represent a high point of Zen, having reached a critical mass of  realized masters, and the writings of his period form the basis and  touchstone of anything that later called itself Zen.  Indeed, this period  is universally recognized as a kind of \\"golden age\\" of Zen.  Thomas  Cleary's selections from the masters of the Five Houses give the general  English reader direct access to the essential words of this foundational  period of Zen.  (This is yet another installment in Cleary's project of  making all the essential ancient Zen writings available in brilliant  English translations; I consider his ongoing work a priceless spiritual  offering to the modern age.)  This book is full of selections from the  masters who (better known by their Japanese names) populate the great  classical koan collections, the *Gateless Gate* and the *Blue Cliff  Record*: Pai-Chang (J: Hyakujo), Lin-chi (J: Rinzai), Tung-shan (J: Tozan),  Hsueh-feng (J: Seppo), and Yun-men (J: Ummon).  Two of the houses, the  House of Lin-chi and the House of Tung-shan, were the progenitors of what  came to be called, respectively, the Rinzai Zen and Soto Zen traditions.  This book is indispensable for making sense of how the important figures of  this fecund period fit together.  I highly recommend this book to beginners  in Zen as well as to anyone who wants a deeper understanding of the  tradition and history of Zen.	2000-08-08

What stands out in  my mind about Lau's translation is the pure poetry, the haunting lyrical  quality of some of the images.  Furthermore, ironically, this is a starkly  pragmatic and realistic translation.  It stands in striking contrast to the  spiritualized New Age translations that try to sublimate the entire text  into the realm of the mystical.  This is a *Tao Te Ching* that considers  the harsh realities of government and warfare, and stakes out bold  counterpositions to the Confucianism which prevailed in the late Chou  Dynasty (c. fifth century BCE).  This *Tao Te Ching* is not un-spiritual,  but its spirituality is well-grounded in a human world of seemingly  intractable problems.  Other translations may appeal to the more  idealistic, but this is perhaps the best translation for those whose  spirituality is essentially bound to the social and political problems of  the world as it is.	2000-08-08

Mr. Waxemberg's advice is straightforward and down-to-earth, and yet is rich in insight.  One of the  themes running through these 18 short essays is the immediacy of spiritual  work: the spiritual road begins right here, right now, in the ordinary  situations and chores and problems of everyday life.  Part One,  \\"Understanding Relationships\\", explores both interpersonal and  intrapersonal relationships.  These make clear that the arena of spiritual  unfolding is the present moment - the person I am right now as well as my  family members and coworkers, the people with whom I interact everyday.  Part Two, \\"Developing Physical and Spiritual Health\\", looks at well-being  in a broad and holistic sense.  These essays have the superficial  appearance of common sense advice, but their subtle implications are  powerful.  The topics seem almost obvious: our failure to appreciate  alternatives creates problems in many situations, and anger makes problems  worse.  Yes, that's true, but what if we think about that and respond to  those truisms in a serious way in our lives?  The cumulative effect of the  essays of Part Two is to show how much our well-being is the result of our  own choices.  Part Three, \\"Discovering our Vocation\\", directly treats  spirituality as a life-choice.  Here, in the title essay, we find the  statement, \\"The most fundamental choice a person makes is what to do with  his or her life\\" (p. 92) - where \\"what to do\\" is ultimately not one's  profession, but one's spiritual orientation.  The vision of spirituality  presented is individual and interior, with a profound respect for the full  freedom and genuine intuition of each soul; at the same time, spiritual  work can never be separated from the web of human interrelatedness.  Mr.  Waxemberg asserts that the spiritual road consists in cultivating an \\"inner  sanctum\\", an inviolable inner place of personal relationship to the Divine,  and yet the work is to break down all that makes up special and different,  all that separates us from others.  The essays are short, many of them only  4 or 6 pages long, so they are ideal reflections before meditating or  before going to sleep.

The book offers profound insights about relationships with one's self, with others, and with the Divine.  The style is so simple and direct  that it is easy to underestimate the depth; only upon reflection do the  scope and power of the writing become evident.  The chapters are relatively  self-contained units, each only a few pages long, so a chapter is ideal  reading before meditation or other spiritual reflection.	2000-03-22

As Mumon has observed in the _Gateless Gate_, &quot;Joshu's tongue has no bone, so he can speak freely.&quot;  That freedom is exactly what is communicated by these aphorism.  Admittedly,  some are hard too understand, but other strike the soul like lightning.  These are the words of a man who underwent the shattering experience of  enlightenment, and the book conveys that sense of power and transcendence.	1999-12-04
