The other side highlights the cities, with largest space for NYC, then Boston, DC, Philly, and smallest for Baltimore. It is a heavy duty, laminated, 6-fold map, measuring 10\\" x 25.\\" Small enough to whip out fast, durable enough to mark up with a crayon or water soluble white board marker. <br /> <br />The only thing I fault the publishers of this First edition is not having a good showing of the factory outlet centers, such as Secaucus NJ and no major Universities such as Princeton. Also there is no grid and index system.	2005-05-29

There is a tourism list and shopping center list but it is all in Chinese characters. <br /> <br />Arguably, Guangdong probably has the most civilized roads for Western tourists; just don't expect anything close to Western driver courtesy and signage of roadways once off of the expressways. Be aware that maps are mainly for the motivated, self-directed tourist to direct his Chinese driving professional. <br /> <br />---------- <br /> <br />Shenzhen <br /> <br />For Shenzhen, China's most popular SEZ across from Hong Kong, I have the Tour and Transportation map of Shenzhen, ISBN 7-80521-706-8, 10/3/2004, Catalog # K*135, Yuan 6.00.

US	52766877	RAR774BFK34E4	1565842502	763686874	China Pop: How Soap Operas, Tabloids and Bestsellers Are Transforming a Culture	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Insights into New China's media biz	Written more than 12 years ago, Ms Zha, at 34, wrote one of the first books on the effects of popular media in the New New China. Written by a native who later emigrated to the US in her mid-20s for graduate school in Lit, the reader should look at is what is said and just as important what is not said. She emigrated right after Tiananmen incident, which had a great impact on her while attending Beijing U. Her arguments with her father, a researcher at one of the China Academies in BJ, caused a great dichotomy in the family. She believes that \\"...culture will save China, I (father) believe the economy will (p14).\\" <br /> <br />As most American readers, we have to filter the official mouthpieces of China Daily, Xinhua, and People's Daily, which are approved newsources of the China Gov't. And there are different editions, for Chinese and English consumption. We have to evaluate their points of view for any hidden agenda. And so it goes in the US too, such as the Epoch Times newspaper published in Chinese in NYC publishes a slant critical of the China Gov't, pro Falun Gong. <br /> <br />Now 46, with a 2003 Guggenheim fellowship under her belt, she has returned to BJ to write more fiction, perhaps break into the movie / TV biz and write a sequel to this book. Her husband, Benjamin Lee, a PhD who has been recently been appointed Graduate Dean of Social Research at The New University, NYC, a 1st gen Chinese anthropologist is also joining her as a mentor and confidant in BJ. His topic of social research is in the field of speculative finance. <br /> <br />Her book, which reads like a novel and easy-to-read multi-layered one like a Tom Clancy novel. Enticingly it gives pomp and circumstance, before delivering a B-school reader in disguise. This book is less about modern Chinese culture as it is about the business of culture. It belies the fact that this serious book is used as required readings at her alma maters, USC, Rice, Chicago, Columbia Chinese culture courses. Unfortunately, it doesn't have an index to locate people, books, films, and SOEs and there is no bibliography or pixs. <br /> <br />The great thing is that her perspective is part BJ native and part BJ expat that is proper for writing books and giving a more dispassionate view on the evolution of the national media. Shunning the myopic view that changes at first glance at warp speed, she gives an insiders view as case studies, to the three major mass-media venues, TV soaps (Chap 2), movies (Chap 4), pulp fiction (Chap 6), and lastly the media impact from Hong Kong (Chap 7) before its 97 repatriation. Lots of research into the insider interviews by the movers and shakers themselves. <br /> <br />In Chap 2, she profiles the creation of a new TV media, soap operas, and how the National TV propaganda machine changed its tune after seeing the popularity of foreign movies on TV. They needed to popularize the social realities of the New China and give a feminist's twist to make sure it appeals to the older generation of retired women too. As in all new and risky endeavors, Zha writes about the key five people involve in bringing out a weekly evening soap, Yearning. The sweatshop mentality, impossible deadlines, dedication at low pay, and eventual burnout. And the series viewership exceeded their wildest dreams. Definitely a close-up of a saga that portends the future of Central Chinese TV. <br /> <br />In Chap 3, she profiles the changes in Beijing's skyline from an architectural viewpoint. She writes about four architects and their futile efforts in instilling cultural preservation and retaining a dignified city. In over 24 pages, she discusses how walls and courtyards previously defined the Chinese family culture and neighborhoods, came down during the Soviet-inspired model city era and the wanton reconstruction of the 80s. And that modern Chinese architecture is now defined in the new Olympic village in northern outskirts of BJ, with the few remaining relics of history left abandoned by modern BJers.  <br /> <br />In Chap 4, she profiles two movie-making directors by contrasting their styles and techniques, Chen Kaige (Yellow Earth, Farewell My Concubine) and Zhang Yimou (Red Sorghum, Raise the Red Lantern). Over 25 pages, she mainly talks about the insider's stories on ego involvement where together they are greater than in competition with each other. She also shows that these expensive cultural epics also drained the State Film industry coffers, such that the succeeding 6th generation of filmmakers had little if any State support for their craft. Fairly shallow discussion on the emerging domestic film industry.  <br /> <br />In Chap 6, Ms Zha writes about the insatiable demand for Jia Pingwa's \\"The Abandoned Capital,\\" pulp-fiction for the masses. In 35 pgs, she shows that after Mao there was such a dirth of sex education, that this type of literature was needed in the city by the politburo, scholars, as well as factory workers. She interviews the author, sex pathology MDs, and Chinese feminists. <br /> <br />In Chap 7, she profiles the CIM (Zhicai) Corp Div of Ming Bao, a HK media mogul, which plans and executes a strategy in expansion into mainland China. In over 30 pages, this is a classical B-school analysis of the triumphs, pitfalls, and personnel intrigue of an OEChinese penetrating into the entrenched Chinese apparatchik. Any new American media mogul contemplating the Chinese market should read this chapter carefully. <br /> <br />Throughout this book, Ms Zha emphasizes that the people who can get things done have to do it with Chinese characteristics, one has to know lots of influential people, be crafty and wily as a fox, and know where the trapdoors and loopholes within the system. Outsiders and individualists are clueless.	2005-02-28
US	52766877	R10PKMB3AKWCDO	0312330774	714091713	Yeh Yeh's House: A Memoir	Books	4	4	4	N	N	An extraordinary family portrait in modern Communist China	Ms Chao, a St Paul, Minn artist and first generation Chinese American, writes a personal travelog about seeking her roots. She portrays a saga with extraordinary sensitivity and cultural transparency. Common with the demands of establishing her professional and family life, she indeterminably delays the plaintive urging of her paternal grandfather (Yeh Yeh) to come and visit him in Beijing before it is too late (p6, 22). Her wryly, humorous writing style makes this an enjoyable read and for Sinophiles there are many topics in each chapter to chuckle and reflect on cultural differences. <br /> <br />She writes about a sojourn of 15 years ago, a 5-week visit with her mother. As with most Americans, she must rely on her to explain and interpret what they see, do and meet. As an added layer of complexity and intrigue, as youngest daughter of three children (p3, 72) she discusses the increasing dichotomy between her and her immigrant thinking parents. During the trip, plans and actions by her mother slowly reveal a newfound awe in her brilliance, cleverness and resourcefulness.  <br /> <br />As a then 38 year old, her trip to China (p110) was set in the late 80s, when Deng Xiaoping's Reform and Opening program is in full swing, but before the Tiananmen Square incident in 89 or completion of the Three Gorges Dam. Her book has 26 chapters divided into 2 sections. Her China journey starts on Part II, Chap 10, p103 with a flight to Shanghai. Her book is illustrated with one portrait of her grandfather and a map of the China journey, but no diagram of the family tree, references or index. There is little discussion on the writing of this book, so the artful craft is ultimately up to the reader to judge the intimate thoughts, innate Chinese mannerisms, and veracity of the passages. <br /> <br />Because of her trip's timing to China, the author portrays the hardship and indelible imprint of Mao's China had on her aunts and uncles, cousins and extended family. While personal andintimate, Chao does not mince words in describing the birth of Communist China and how the various epics of the Cultural Revolution, Great Leap Forward and Reform left their lasting imprint and what it meant to survive. She also clearly and succinctly describes the life and environment of the common people, both their pleasures and their warts.    <br /> <br />Part I is a prelude to the actual trip. Sung Lien, her Chinese name given by her grandfather, has been calling for her several times since the 70s. Her grandfather was a famous theologian at Yenching U, Beijing, one of the first Christian missionary schools in China and who was educated at Vanderbilt U in the States. Her grandfather was Dean of Yenching's School of Religion and a top China leader for the World Council of Churches. During the Cultural Revolution, the Red Guard singled out Chao Tzu-ch'en for reform of intellectuals and religion. Reform meant forced public recantation of beliefs, burning of his works, being publically denounced, interrogated, imprisonment and menial labor in service to the new regime. Later the Communist regime takes over Yenching to form the elite Peking University. <br /> <br />Interestingly Chao describes the several visits from the extended family to the US. For example in Chap 3, her paternal aunt visited, just after Yeh Yeh committed suicide during to the Red Guard purge of pro-Western ideology (p77). The visit is a distant, highbrow one as her mother describes her paternal aunt, who is cut in the same cloth of her grandfather. Then her other Beijing paternal uncle and his wife visited her family in the US (Chap 5-7), whom she bonded with and immensely enjoyed. They reinforced that it is in her destiny to visit her grandfather house in China, portending that this trip alone, she will experience profound events that will affect her life immeasurably. Chao always demurs that she has no time and must learn Mandarin first.  <br /> <br />The previous nine chapters in Part I setthe stage for the trip, in a autobiographical portrait of the author during childhood, school, young adult, and professional life as a musician for a major city orchestra. The author clearly and sensitively portrays the common issues between immigrant and later generations. There is much misunderstanding and resentment that mother and daughter distance themselves as a matter of self-preservation (p100). <br /> <br />Chao finally decides to go to China with her mother in 1984 (p84) just after her Beijing Uncle's visit. Three years later and with three months of Mandarin lessons, they depart in June 1987. <br /> <br />Part II, over the next 180 pgs or 2/3rds of the book, is a personal travelog to visit relatives and mother's friends in Shanghai, Xi'an, Chongqing, Yangtze River trip through the 3 Gorges to Wuhan, Changsha, and finally Beijing. This travelog is unique that it shows how to travel as the natives do and how to circumvent travel issues that come up due to the overburdened transportation systems that existed in this slice in time. It also shows the family life and thought patterns of modern Chinese as they weathered the birth and maturation of the new China State. <br /> <br />It also shows the bewilderment and culture shock that any new visitor to China would experience. Chao's innate sensitivity to her environment, facilitiates her writing to include the thrills and pleasures as well as doubts and misgivings in well crafted elocution. In Shanghai and environs, she visits her maternal aunt and family (Chap11-14); flying to Xi'an, she visits her mother's former classmate, friends and Terra-Cotta warriors (Chap 15-18); flying to Chongqing, she visits with a Director of an actor's troupe and family (Chap 17); set sail thru the famed 3 Gorges (Chap 18); in Wuhan, she visits with former classmate, who gets them train tickets to Changsha; where she visits with her mother's sister and brother and families (Chap 19-20); finally she gets the elusive plane tickets to Beijing to visit her paternal and maternal aunts, uncles and friends, the Great Wall and Forbidden City (Chap 21-25); and finally train tickets back to their Shanghai POE.	2005-02-10

There are 11 chapters covering 3 main sections covering geography, cultural history, and western explorers and 3 Gorges Dam plans. The middle chapters cover a Westerner's approach in analyzing why people and metropolises located in the space that they do. His book's structure was by emulating Braudel's work on the Mediterranean some 40 years earlier (which I haven't read). <br /> <br />vanSlyke's book covers geography, geology, plate tectonics, earthquakes, climate, weather, history and culture. He also has vignettes on unusual livelihoods, such as how it was to be a tracker towing boats upstream. Included is what's it like being a rice, silk, or tea merchant. In Chap 8, he discusses the whys on junk boat design which is specifically made to negotiate the treacherous gorges enroute to Chongqing and Chengdu. In Chap 10, he shows the strategic importance of the Yangtze River from medieval through modern times. The last chapter 11 talks about the future, the 3 Gorges Dam and Southern Waters North projects. <br /> <br />As an armchair traveler, the author and you can analyze the whys and wherefores before visiting China. For example, I've always wondered why the capital, Beijing, is located in north China? It is in there on p67, 71. Another question, why is the Yellow River rarely spoken about in the media compared to the Yangtze? It is in there on p12. Why is flooding (China's sorrow) so devastating where millions died, yet flooding of rice paddies is the source of life? It is in there on p12, 68, 89. <br /> <br />Although this slim book is 16 years old, I learned much more with vanSlyke's book than Simon Winchester's Yangtze river (1998) book. vanSlyke's book incites the reader to ask many rhetorical and pedagogical questions about China that the natives don't even know or ponder about.  <br /> <br />While this book could be considered as a China traveler's supplement, it doesn't show or discuss any modern alternative routes, such as via highways and rail. Maps and city names often have to be translated from W-G to modern Pinyin Chinese, which adds confusion. Bought this book for cheap during a pre-holiday sale in the used book section of a major local bookseller. Liberally illustrated with 46 maps, diagrams, pixs, etchings, artwork, and a table, this book makes it easier to understand the layout and lore of the Yangtze River valley, its inhabitants, and results of Western explorers. It has an ineffective 5 1/2-page index but a good annotated 6-page bibliography. There are several excerpted poems about the river, including Mao's. <br /> <br />While reading this book, I couldn't help drawing an analogy to our Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam (which the author doesn't), the California aquaducts from Northern CA for irrigation, and Colorado river aquaducts to the LA and San Diego metro area and Imperial River valley. He goes over the cost benefits ratio and the bickering over special interests, just as in Davis's book on the California water projects (Rivers in the Desert, 0-06-016698-3, 1993). <br />	2004-12-07
US	52766877	R3LWBSPHX9SRT9	0060596325	835043093	Rice: A Novel	Books	3	8	25	N	N	A tragic family epic, but some incredible translation issues	This moving tale is about a country orphan who goes to the city to seek his fortune. With a cunning bravado, he fakes his way into a rice dealer's son-less family and slowly takes over business and both daughters. An important read as the American novel marketplace has only a few written by a native male Chinese. <br /> <br />At the gateway to the city, the protagonist is attacked by the city's stevedore gang, which portends his future. The rice dealer uses the gang to also buy up his competition and protects his shipments. He also ruthlessly gets involved with a gang, initially to avenge his greeting, and eventually ends up as a Godfather. He rules the neighborhood, continues ruthlessly extracting protection money, and assuring his rice supply.  <br /> <br />The story has all that can be imagined happening in the decadent Shanghai. Covers three generations and how each member of the family ends up in violent tragedy. Primarily a book on a patriarch's (read: man's) perspective to violence, depravity and frailties of a harsh side of Chinese family life set during the 1930s. <br /> <br />Since the story is written by a Shanghai area (Suzhou) native, who majored in Chinese lit at a Beijing university, and remains in the Shanghai (Nanjing) area, I assume that it is the skill of the translator in portraying appropriate vignettes and modifies storylines as he sees fit if he feels that the author's intent is not understandable by an American reader.  <br /> <br />The Jewish American translator writes a fast moving story using modern American idiom. He keeps the reader moving through the story with many stereotypically Chinese descriptions, character thoughts, and appropriate quips of philosophy of life's fate. Probably something that every Chinese American has heard at one time or another. <br /> <br />While the story unifies the role of rice as the staff of life, consider this book primarily as entertainment. If you think that you will learn something about pre-CommunistChinese culture and modern post-Communist Chinese thought, the Jewish translator really does NOT credibly describe the intimate details of Chinese behavior, habits, and mannerisms. For example, I just can't imagine popping raw rice in one's mouth, like sunflower seeds. How about sleeping directly on a loose pile of rice? Why not on several loosely packed bags of rice like a beanbag chair. I think not. Also forcing rice up a woman's vagina is a bit of a stretch as a credible method of a Chinese man's marking of trophy women. <br /> <br />Nor will you learn much about rice quality although quality is mentioned often. He talks casually about the smell of raw rice, but doesn't talk much about the smell of cooked boiled rice, fried rice, round sticky rice in tea leaves and rice desserts, other than burned rice. And he doesn't cover different rice varieties having different scents and flowery bouquets (eg, Thai jasmine), what is it like with spring vs autumn rice, milled vs brown, new rice vs old, nor black or broken rice. Never read anything about the rice paddy planting and harvesting or visiting a rice mill. <br /> <br />However, the translator does much better in interpreting types of Chinese behavior that appears common to Jewish behavior, such as, using other people's money, gold teeth, hiding money boxes, buy low and sell high, talking to the neighborhood via a monolog from the rooftop, etc. <br /> <br />In comparison, I would recommend more highly Amy Tan's books for more accurate and sensitive portrait of Chinese culture, but with a matriarch's view of family.	2004-11-29

He does well to set the story with this foreboding, eventually to the breaking point in the last fifth of the book. This author uses the patience ideal, building up scenerio after scenerio. As the reader you know that the protagonists are being frustrated by the waiting but don't show it. You know something is going to happen, you just don't know what. It is the last dozen pages that give away life's issues. <br /> <br />Don't read unless you have patience. The author emigrated from his native China to study at Brandeis U, teaches English at Emory U. One of the few Chinese American men who write good fiction based on life in the new China.	2004-11-29

They gathered info from these interviews and wrote them up in Chinese. The interviewers did not use tape recorders, which I think would intimidate interviewees, but then the authenticity of the talks would depend entirely on the skill of the journalists. It appears that the authors cherry picked about a fourth of the interviews from people who already had been in the news before as model Chinese. This material was originally published as a column in NYC-based \\"China Daily News\\" for expats and OEChinese. Then it was republished as a compendium in Shanghai-based literary magazines in 1985 and a book in 1986 all in Chinese.<br />An editorial staff translated 64 of the 100+ articles from Chinese into Shanghai (UK) English. They edited them into appropriate idiomatic English that would be typical of the speaker. So the vignettes typically had lots of street slang from teenagers, the indigent and peasants, a more formal and cautious tone from middle aged adults, and more reverent speech from the retired. So this work simulated talking about a slice of life from the Chinese public and are categorized into 17 general topics about life. There is no index.<br />Since many interviews were from the available populace who are willing to talk, and many weren't, this book is one of the very few where Americans can read about a slice of life of peasants (small time farmers), the unemployed, the indigent, and the handicapped, something that you will not get at all in tourist books. It also includes a few vignettes on the new \\"petty capitalism with Chinese characteristics,\\" introduced by Deng's Reform and Opening policy started almost a decade earlier in 1978. Quite a few vignettes captured the essence in surviving the social and economic turmoil of the 50s and 60s of Mao's early socialist experiments. I read this book at a local public library while researching the attitudes of modern China after Deng Xiaoping's death of 1997.<br />Remember, these thoughts are but a slice in time; because most interviews are extemporaneous, ie not planned out or written down. So there are interviews that are obviously braggarts, social climbers, talk about family conflicts and airing dirty laundry, and about a third who have something profound to say as they have tightly sealed their lips heretofore to avoid persecution. Interviews averaged about 4 Â½ pages; the shortest about a page and the longest about 11 pages (Prison p229). Many were done in the Beijing / Nanjing metro area; the next common area was in Hebei and Shandong provinces just south of Beijing and Tianjin. Some interviews were done in Szechwan, Shanghai, Harbin, Guangzhou, and the minority regions of SW China. There is a two-page map of China with many specific interview locations marked, along with provinces, rivers, large cities, and certain mountainous areas. There are no city or county maps although many interviews reference these areas. <br />One thing that rang out loud and clear is that the Communist regime did an exhaustive job of methodically and systematically identifying and ridding of the Black 5s (p180); landowners, capitalists, rightists, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, those who would try to foment more political unrest. In tandem, they installed a socialist system with people that pledged undying allegiance, mainly the young and the malleable. They used the military at first, then city police, then the Red Guard, and street committees to effectively subjugate the populace down to the village level. Every person had a government dossier file that identified potential defectability, similar to what is in the Diary of Anne Frank and other books on persecution of the Jews by Nazi Germany. This left an indelible mark on families as they saw many people executed or shipped off to forced labor or re-education camps. Those that were borderline were put in socialist internment labor camps in poor, desolate areas and have them \\"educate\\" the indigenous peasant, much like our Vista program.<br />The old system of social class is very evident in the interviews as each vignette is prefaced with age, occupation, position in the family, and occupation of their parents and grandparents. Family names and township / village were left out upon request for anonymity. The topics included are: making a living, recent social history, climbing the social ladder, marriage and family, petty capitalism, peasant life, non-traditional workers, working in SOEs, working in the Party and RedGuard, individualists, crime, work as soldiers and in Defense, social history, life with handicaps, traveling salespeople, show business, and youth coping with success, failure, and apathy. Each topic will have 3-5 vignettes on the topic. Even today, it appears that the local commune and street committees that were setup so long ago need to give permission for any moving, business, and work requests. This persistent bureaucracy is so endemic that guanxi, bribery, and groveling to local politicos is necessary to improve one's status. Probably similar to our local neighborhood associations and city councils.<br />The more memorable vignettes were about a building construction entrepreneur (p87-94), pro-am bridge builder (p99-110), prison life for incest and murder by a juvenile (pg 229-40), and a privileged elder of avionics technology & foreign JV pre-WWII (p253-60).<br />This book could be compared to the popular radio and TV talk shows in the US, from national syndications to fluffy local ones. A talk with those people willing to be put on hold for a long time and then to be famous by speaking their mind in their brief slice in time. So take this book within the validity and context of Talk shows. I'd also compare the authors' work as relevantand comprehensive as Peter Hessler's River Town. One thing they didn't cover is suicide.	2004-06-01
US	52766877	R1OJFAZJMF3TWP	068480316X	642260911	Big Dragon: China's Future, What It Means For Business, the Economy, and the Global Order	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Actually about politics, sociology, and Chinese history	Written about 5 years ago by a NYC investment banker and a China Mgmt consultancy based in CT, this book is naturally positive towards PRChina. This book covers the end of the second decade of Premier Deng's Reform and Opening to foreign investment. And before the Asian crash of 2000.<br />The authors' point-of-view is towards the political, sociological, and militarily first, economics second, and corporate investment third. They obliquely discuss US corporate investments, but this is neither a How To book, nor a B-school reader. Many remarks and keylines are more towards an extended discussion of temporal news and the sensational, as opposed to business facts and analysis. Like a fleshed out Neisbitt text of glittering generalities.<br />The strengths of this book are in interpreting and extended discussion on the how's and why's socialism with Chinese characteristics work as it does. When the Western press lays down emotionally charged words of democracy, free market, entrepreneur, etc, these concepts need careful explanations on what, exactly, this means in the Chinese context and the surrounding business milieu. These explanations, implications, and why they are so, as the reader will discover is quite different from straight Western interpretations.<br />The first half of the book deals with China history since Mao after WWII. Then Deng's Opening in Chap 2, p47 there is a 2-page discussion on Overseas Ethnic Chinese and their investment into the homeland in the Shenzhen SEZ. On p127, the authors agree that a \\"Greater China\\" exists including Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the OEChinese business dominated ASEAN countries all cooperating. In Chap 8, they discuss the enormity of the State-Owned-Enterprises which are largely non-performing by western standards, but who employ over 70% of the domestic urban workforce of 170 million people. Many SOEs are producing obsolete products, with a featherbedded workforce, that have been superceded by a market economy in other sectors. The new Premiers Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji appear serious in slowly reforming the SOEs, the bedrock of the socialist empire.<br />The second half of the book deals with China's problems and issues, starting with Chap 8. Most Western press criticize the apparent lack of responsibility from leaders on these issues, SOEs, banks, SOL, SSI, etc. The authors, in contrast, evaluate this criticism in context of the larger whole and cite how deliberate progress is being made. As illustrated by three entrepreneurial case studies in Part III covering 30 pages, Chinese entrepreneurship is fostered by the Politburo as an experiment to help shore up the SOE profitability. So-called capitalism with Chinese characteristics is fostered in order to quickly develop real estate, along with large OEChinese capital infusions, so that there are suitable industrial parks (SEZ) to attract foreign investment to setup hi-tech manufacturing. The Politburo then covets corporate America with deep pockets in order to gather hard currency, implement new technology, create new jobs, and expand exports to further fund national and educational infrastructure and technology upgrades in SOEs. This conclusion is consistent with Jim Mann's book a decade earlier in \\"Beijing Jeep,\\" and the authors agree on p90 that for corporate America to be successful in PRChina, it will require both manufacturing and technology transfer to the Chinese JVs. All under the watchful eye and blessing of the Politburo. Pretty crafty!<br />In Chap14 and 15 The Next Five Years, on p278 significant political and social change will not occur until the Chinese GenX, 5th gens who grew up in a post-Mao era, come to power in about 20 years, about year 2020. <br />Lets see if any of the author's prophecies came true. While discussed along with MFN status p364, they did not predict that China would win WTO admission in 2001. Also they didn't predict the Millennium crash in Asia, their forecast was for 2004 p341. On p340, they saidthat the Three Gorges Dam's first generators would turn on in 2003, actual is 2004. On p309, the authors did write about 2 inches on the oil, Persian Gulf, and Islamic issues, but did not predict the US-Iraq War. Pretty myopic vision for globalists? Score is 1 for 4. Not good. There are many more prophesies to 2024, Year of the Dragon, which includes Taiwan's return to the China fold.<br />In the last Chapter 18, the authors continue harping on US-China Cold-War. They plead that after 30 years, an updated Shanghai Compact 2002 needs to be enacted. I fail to see the significance in ending their book with 20+ pages on the subject, including many shorter US Hawk rampages on the subject spread throughout their text. <br />The book's rear dust jacket poses 6 fundamental questions on the coming changes in the new world order. These questions must have been written by the editors, because I'd say that the authors did not really specifically address these questions in any detail, read: don't judge a book by its cover, which I read at a local public library.<br />The authors have 18 Chapters and a 14-page index. Each page has a sidebar quote from important dignitaries, both western and Chinese, hence the inflated 400 page book. There are no tables of World Bank numbers, no pictures or figures or maps. There are 10 pages of Notes, mainly from US / UK periodicals. The Acknowledgement pages give recognition to about 150 people that they interviewed, more than three quarters have Chinese surnames. However, for security reasons, they are not footnoted in the book.	2004-05-25
US	52766877	R2Y1HVS82MR03P	0893462853	45010857	Your Chinese Roots: The Overseas Chinese Story	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Best book that Iï¿½ve found on the Chinese diaspora	This excellent book chronicles the Chinese diaspora from Guangdong and Fujian provinces in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Finally I see in print the reasons for the diaspora, ie starvation due to crop failures and overcrowding. The whys and wherefores are clearly described in this book, which I had a nagging suspicion occurred and read fragments that have been obliquely alluded to in various China and US travel books. People just don't leave enmass from a country without some real impetus, gold mountain or not.<br />The author is a Singaporean born sociologist and parts of this book were the basis for his doctorate thesis. While large sections of the book are dedicated to the Overseas Ethnic Chinese (OEC) that settled in Singapore, the next largest sections cover the US, as he earns his doctorate at the Univ of Virginia. The least covered area of the diaspora is towards Southeast Asia. Almost nothing is discussed about the Philippines and South America.<br />In Chap 3, p 43-48 the author documents what districts in Canton and Fujian most emigrants actually left, the number, what dialects they spoke, and what areas (Nanyang) they were bound for. He also goes on to say how many returned and the net outflow that stayed in their adopted country. On p47, I was amazed to read that almost 5 million people left in the last 25 years of the 19th century.<br />Much is said better elsewhere about the successful OEChinese that dominate the economies in many ASEAN nations, especially in G T Haley etal, \\"New Asian Emperor\\" (98, 0-7506-4130-4). No wonder the PRChina is courting the OEC to come back and invest in the SEZs.<br />In Chap 4, he discusses the diaspora, in order of significance, to Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia in four pages. In Chap 5 in 17 pgs, he covers the diaspora to the US goldmines, building of the railroad, discrimation and exclusion laws, emigration, and finally the Amer Born Chinese. On p80 there is a table of Chinese entering the US broken down to decadewhich was referenced from Rose Hum Lee's early work in 1960. The peak immigration occurred in the 1870s and totals just under a half million covering a century. In Chap 6 in 14 pgs, he covers the similar diaspora to Australia, New Zealand and the UK.<br />In Part III in 3 chapters the author covers Chinese organizations and financial and protective covenants formed in their respective countries. This section is heavily biased towards historical events in Singapore, the States (20 pgs), and the UK Commonwealth. About one page (p137) describes the self-financing of businesses in the US, using family associations, or \\"hui-kuans.\\" The author does not predict accurately the effects of the 1997 repatriation of Hong Kong p164, resulting modern diaspora and exodus to Canada, especially in Vancouver, Toronto and Ottawa, where money buys you citizenship and upscale housing. There is almost no discussion of Chinese organizations in other ASEAN nations; the 2-pg listing in the Appendix is just for Singapore. The role of the Tongs, Triads, and Secret Societies is discussed in context of Singapore (p114-6) and the US (p139-40). There is no discussion of the great 1909 San Francisco fire, its destruction of official POE immigration records, and the resulting shams used by Chinese to further the immigration of relatives and family.<br />Tan's book is nicely laid out and organized into four parts with 12 chapters, including quotes and poetry. He has a 3 Â½-page bibliography and a 4-page index. The book is illustrated with 3 crude maps, several tables, 10 reproductions of drawings and etchings, and about 20 photographs which include US Chinatowns. There are many Chinese characters sprinkled in the text to help clarify any translations needed and for making your own family \\"chop\\" if desired. There is a 2-pg appendix that transliterates pinyin and Wade-Giles romanization of character pronunciation, but is mainly limited to provinces and famous people. Published almost 20 years ago, I read this book at a local library. He could have had a glossary, however, as he doesn't always define a Chinese word, eg Nanyang, although he uses it everywhere.<br />As far as his last Part 4 on tracing your Chinese roots, a large (65 pgs, about 1/5th of the book) chapter 12 is devoted to listing almost 50 most popular surnames (with alternative spellings) and a short page describing where the name originated in early Chinese history together with many Chinese characters. I'm somewhat dubious about the value of this listing as only a fraction of these names relate to the diaspora from the Canton and Fujian area. But it is interesting reading and can assist in tracing your roots within China, especially on both sides of the family beyond the typical 4-5 generations.<br />In Chap 11, he has a 2-pg description of the Chinese dialects and where they are located geographically in the two provinces and a useful table on p177 which lists destination countries, which province / district of origin, and dialect. He doesn't describe the differences in the dialects, however, and why they result in intense clan or family loyalty.<br />He compares the Chinese diaspora to the States very briefly on p47 with the earlier Irish emigration in the mid 1800s during the Potato famine which drove them to re-settle in Boston and NYC.	2004-05-25
US	52766877	R86ABK91EBZ8L	0671620274	416275805	Beijing Jeep: The Short, Unhappy Romance of American Business in China	Books	4	7	8	N	N	A good How-*Not*-To China investment reader	Fifteen years ago, this book chronicled the successes, foibles, and missteps on the first US auto manufacturers to startup in modern China. This during the time when Premier Deng was just starting to modernize China's industry in the early 80s after Mao's death. Written by Jim Mann, this was his first book as a LA Times bureau chief stationed in Beijing for 3 years. He finishes the book just after Tiananmen incident in 1989, when the new acquirer Chrysler buys AMC from Renault and shuts the Chinese JV down.<br />The book does an excellent job at depicting the cat and mouse game where the Americans were trying for easy money just being assembler of parts kits from Detroit. The Chinese wanted newer technology models, to upgrade the Soviet installed manufacturing of legacy Jeeps that was sold during the 50s. They also wanted design capability and technology transfer assistance to build their own manufacturing infrastructure. The unspoken terms that China's leaders wanted: to be able to design and manufacture the Jeep themselves. Not content to merely be an assembler, they had self-reliance goals to provide the PLArmy's with a new four door, soft-top Jeep, now and for years to come. This takes a huge amount of resources and money, which both China and AMC did not have. China didn't have lots of hard currency and AMC was simply undercapitalized and did not have a parent with deep pockets.<br />Mann's story has 25 chapters and 6 pages of notes, most references are from American and Chinese newspapers. His tale of woe is interesting, fast paced, and reads like a novel. Of course most of the dialog is from AMC's point of view, but he attempts to decipher the Chinese point of view too. But like most things PRChinese, it was day late and a dollar short. His book also includes a useable 13-page index. I did not read the B-school version of this book published 9 years later, but read this book from a local public library. Mann's conclusion is that American business will have anexpensive, long, arduous, and bittersweet experience in establishing a manufacturing beachhead in China. His last remark is: \\"If there ever is truly a huge, unified China market, it will likely be captured not by the foreigners who have been pursuing this commercial dream for more than a century, but first of all by the Chinese themselves.\\"<br />One thing that Mann does not do is set the larger stage on what other company's investments are going on during the Deng's Reform and Opening (79-89), for both American and Chinese. He does do a very brief intro on p114 on Overseas Ethnic Chinese (OEChinese), but did not describe any OEChinese investments into mainland China. I think this is a serious omission as it would have been very interesting to see a comparison and contrast between management styles and preferential treatment given to Chinese re-patriots. Most early repats established JVs in the Shenzhen and Xiamen SEZs in the 80s. As a group, OEChinese are a tremendous US$3Trillion economic force as described in Chapter 11 of Rohwer's book \\"Asia Rising,\\" (1995, 0-684-82548-1). <br />OEChinese is also covered in a Singapore Mgmt U's, G.T. Haley's etal \\"New Asian Emperors,\\" (1998, 0-7506-4130-4) another B-school reader. On p58-9, there is a listing of 37 important OEChinese families. There are over 25 OEChinese Billionaires in ASEAN nations. OEChinese actually did the most investment into China during the first decade of Deng's Opening, especially from Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines. They funneled funds in through Hong Kong. This was described in Haley's book 5 years ago and Rohwer's book 10 years ago but covers the same time frame as Mann's.<br />Hong Kong-based Rohwer's thesis was that US will benefit from China and Beijing-based Mann's thesis is opposite.	2004-05-25
US	52766877	R2DULO24IY5DLR	080143646X	845169144	Looking for Chengdu: A Woman's Adventures in China (Anthropology of Contemporary Issues)	Books	4	1	2	N	N	A view of Chinese womenï¿½s entrepreneurial spirit	This book is a memoir of a decade past written following a Rockerfeller grant to study the women's emancipation movement in SW PRChina, to later compare and contrast with a similar study in Taipei, Taiwan. This fieldwork is undertaken with the cooperation of the Propaganda Dept, Women's Federation, Chengdu, Szechwan province, PRChina.<br />Structurally this book is a daily diary which covers, in part, her travels in China as well as some highlights of 100 interviews on women-owned, small business entrepreneurs, that were formed during the Deng's Reform and Opening campaign of the late 80s. <br />Her POE is Guangzhou, where she decides to initially travel alone much as the natives do. Her travel scenarios, including her visit to Kunming, City of Eternal Spring, in the first 50 pages of the book, where she had local academic acquaintances to show her the sights. She speaks Putonghua, a form of Mandarin, so she can slowly communicate with the locals in a basic form. It appears that she does not like reading Chinese. In part, she writes with the older Wade-Giles form of romanization, so Szechwan is Sichuan and Taipei is Taibei. Armed with an Academy letter, she uses it to travel, as best she can to cajole the ticket sellers and hostel and guesthouse desks, the way the natives do, and cites prices in RMB, and FEC only when there is no other alternative or she wishes to splurge with a hot bath. <br />The more memorable scenarios is her visit to Kunming, capital of the mountainous Yunnan province p36-44 in December 1988. They travel up the Burma Road a bit and discuss the minority people and their distinctive dress p54-8. She eats the native food and promptly gets a bad case of diarrhea, spends two days in bed. She buys a beautiful Naxi cape from a leather maker that was destined to be another bride's dowry. <br />Halfway through her anthropological project, her tired workgroup of four demands that she take vacation and unknownst to her, her host department arranged a 7-day holiday with a drive and excursion into far Western Szechwan province to enjoy the Fall colors and stay with a Tibetan family p109-138. Anticipating a boring trip and getting behind in her project, she crankily accompanies the group during another PMS episode. Contrary to her expectation, she enjoys the trip immensely, romps in the forest, and sees blue sky. At each stop, there are local Women's Federation reps to show the group around and introduce them to native families, translate discussions, and describe what they are seeing. They discuss the Tibetan-Han dichotomy and how each culture tries to co-exist.<br />There are about 20 scenarios on interviews on women-owned businesses in the book. Most businesses are small, from mom &amp; pop format to ones with handfuls of employees. They are the stereotypical grocery, restaurant, garment, and etc format. What I got out of the book was that women's survival during the \\"Great Leap Forward\\" and Cultural Revolution was very harsh, especially in the countryside. Initially the Politburo encouraged formation of these businesses, the owners used the profits to improve their houses, and then the tax collectors came to even things out in the socialist's tradition. So the Politburo is inventing their policies at time goes. It seeds flourishing entrepreneur until they become successful, then taxes them for an increased revenue stream.<br />Her writing is fairly well crafted and she discusses scenarios of general interest, so that one can finish the book without getting truly bored of repetitious fieldwork details. The book, divided into 19 chapters, includes about 20 photos of subjects, maps and travel itineries to follow along. There is no index and any notes are referenced on the bottom of the page. Comparatively, I would consider her prose better and more comprehensive than Paul Theroux, a China travel writer covering the same time period. But Peter Hessler is a better describer of Chinese thought and behavior; of course hespent 2 years at a teachers college and learned the local dialect. But as indicated in the preface, she notes her literary limits and includes her published bibliography of academic work.<br />The author is a Canadian born, UK raised and educated, who writes in UK prose, so you have to decipher the usual suspects that differ in UK vs US English. She earns her doctorate at Central Michigan U, but is at heart a Brit feminist, and constantly refers to it during her sojourn. From time to time this divorced, pre-menopausal woman titillates the reader with her fantasies as a ravishing redhead in China. To me this was pulp-fiction that the editors must have required her to put in the scripts to help sales. I could have also done without the monthly PMS issues.<br />She keeps contemporaneous notes on her notebook computer, so hopefully 10 years later, she doesn't over embellish or forget the details of her 6 month sojourn in Chengdu. I read this book at a local library.<br />She attempts to unify her prose by introducing a historical mentor that went before her, a fellow Brit, Ms Isabella Bird Bishop, who does China research in Szechwan a century earlier. Since she merely references her work in a couple pages p48-9, I find it rather distracting, yet amused that she compared her journey to hers.	2004-05-25
US	52766877	R1AGZRXEV0G8G0	0684807521	571658447	Asia Rising:Why America Will Prosper as Asia's Economies Boom	Books	5	2	2	N	N	One of the best Intros to Greater China	Mr Rohwer is a HK based journalist for London's newsweekly, The Economist, spending more than 5 years in HK and 12 years at the magazine before writing his first book which was a decade in the making. It is an ambitious book, as he presents and interprets the rise of Asian countries since WWII, with center stage on PRChina's development, yet including the 5 Tigers (Japan, S Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Singapore), Indochina, and the India and Pakistani subcontinent. Asia is illustrated on a two page map and PRChina with a separate map, along with almost 20 tables, graphs, and charts. He has a comprehensive 10-page bibliography and a 16-page index. Rohwer is an uncommonly forthright author, writes without the British colloquialism and arrogance of journalists based in the UK as he was educated in the States at UC Berkeley and a Harvard Law JD.<br />In a broad-brush introduction in the first three chapters he compares and contrasts the Asian to Western economies. Each Asian country (1995) is presented as metrics in tables (p38-39) so that the reader can quickly compare and contrast key measurements such as GNP, GD Savings, GD Investment, Gov't spending, demographics, imports and exports. Most metrics were based on World Bank reports. He also presents the population growth to year 2015 (p43) of Asian cities and how they compare around the world. Most importantly he showed, from a historical perspective, the political and economic structures in Taiwan and S Korea to foster growth after the devastation of WW2 and Korean conflict.<br />Then he concentrated on the Greater China community in the next four chapters (80 pgs) which I consider the meat of his book. This includes PRChina (Communist), Taiwan (Western), and OEChinese (ASEAN). In the late 80s and early 90s, the OEChinese invested in PRChina, more than from Japan and US (p108). I was surprised to find out how PRChina become the investor into HK and Taiwan so that it can rev-up its own economy (p133).<br />Rohwer contends that the Achilles'heel of PRChina is timely development of the infrastructure in rural and cities; such as roads, electrical grid, communications, sewage, fewer barriers to trading (freight forwarding), and rule of law (p140). Rapid development of this societal infrastructure is the key impediments for the Greater China to become the #2 dominant economy in the world by 2015.<br />The core information regarding the OEChinese and how they fit into the Greater China community is in Chap 11 The Business Roster: The Hua Ch'iao. In over 14 pages, Rowher explains the intricacies network of self-capitalization and family enterprise formation. On this basis, he shows how OEChinese dominated the businesses in Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Furthermore, he goes on to show that the Greater China generates business value that is currently larger than the US and is comparable with Japan plus Western Europe. This occurred because Chinese were not consumption-oriented (large savers), taxes for social infrastructure (welfare) were non-existent, and a finely tuned underground financial network for them to quickly make business decisions. Sort of a self-imposed exile in lieu of starvation or political persecution, OEChinese became the gypsy Jews of the East (p231), but later made good. As a class, Rohwer estimates that there are more than 50 million OEChinese (a sixth of US population) throughout the world. Rohwer further remarks that these OEChinese often keep their enterprises secret and private to the world's scrutiny and out of the media spotlight.<br />In looking into his crystal ball, Rohwer accurately predicted the 1) Asian crash of 2000 (p18), 2) PRChina economic growth in the next decade 6-7% year (p166) compared to 7-8% actual and 3) American companies have the best position to benefit with investment and trade with PRChina (p214).<br />Less well, he didn't predict 1) PRChina's entry in WTO on Sept 2001 (p98), 2) the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtzeriver startup 5 years ahead of his estimate of 2010 (p263), and 3) the millennium deluge of American private financing of projects in PRChina (p277).<br />Most people acknowledge that the PRChinese SEZs have been a huge success for economic growth with private enterprise with Chinese characteristics primarily funded by OEChinese. From the tremendous growth of Xaimen with labor intensive electronics industry and Shenzhen with a broad based labor intensive industry, Deng Xiaoping's experiment in Chinese capitalism was a runaway success. This success begat the TVE (community owned collectives which had free reign from Beijing) and it had spectacular success with local market-oriented PRChinese agriculture and light industry. With over 20 million TVEs formed since the 1990s (p130), PRChina became largely self-sufficient in food production and producing quality items to support the industrial and rural infrastructure. These successes spurred on PRChina self-opening to the world for foreign trade, investment, and market-driven enterprises that is on-going today. There are many SEZs, in every province, provincial capitals, major cities and towns, interior, Yangtze river, coastal, and islands (p136).<br />Note that these efforts for opening the PRC for trade and investment was due to PRChina doing it on its own terms. It started after Nixon visited China in 1972 and culminated with Deng's visit to see Carter in 1979. The resulting TV media play in PRChina galvanized and electrified the PRChinese populace (p132) for a market-driven economy. No more colonization.<br />The most significant SEZs are:<br />Xiamen across Taiwan Straits - Central East coast, electronics manufacturing <BR>Shenzhen near Hong Kong - South Coast, light manufacturing<BR>Pudong in Shanghai-Central East coast of China, future financial center of PRChina<BR>Zhongguancun in Beijing - Capital, High-Tech Silicon Valley of China<br />Some authors can ferret the facts, evaluate economic activity at the grassroots, micro, and macro level, and use this knowledge to predict the future, such as Rohwer. Other authors grab the headlines with glittering generalities and post facts from a narrow slice of time, and try to make sweepingly broad generalizations that can't help from being non-sophomoric, as John Neisbitt's Megatrends Asia and Joe Studwell's China Dream.	2004-04-03

You can install this on Server 2K, Server 2K3, Server NT4SP6, and Win98SE; but the installation chapter is a download from the publisher's website to save book space!<br />The heart of the book, Part II DataBase (DB) Design, has 4 chapters over 112 pages for describing relational DB, creating a Customer DB, indexing, triggers, programming, and procedures. He devotes 2+ pages to Locking. Then in Part III Interface Design, he has 3 chapters covering 80 pages for describing SQL, Query, and Import/Export. Slim pickings for a budding DBA, many tables; maybe one can use this book as an abridged reference.<br />Then there's more, Part IV Enterprise Issues, Chap 11 goes over making a DB backup / restore that I agree needs to be covered. And Chap 12 covering web serving your DB is OK, but I'd hold the line on Chap 13 where he covers Distributed Queries over multiple servers, to exploit the Enterprise version capability. Like most budding DBAs are going to have multiple, remote, networked DB servers at his disposal? Nonetheless, this chapter seems to be the author's pride and joy. I'd highly recommend the author use these 12 precious pages to beef up what he has already covered.<br />But most superfilous is his Appendix A, where he expends over 18 precious pages for Wizard flowcharts. What a waste! The Security chapter is a download from the publisher's website. The author is at tmann at vbasic dot com .<br />His book's most significant failing is not showing how to display or print out a result or report of a DB query. Perhaps the author hasn't found out that reports are the life-blood of business. He gives a half page mention of the Crystal Report Writer in the last chapter (p338), but neither integrates reports in his book, nor indicates that an older v4.5 (96) version is bundled with the SQL Server 2K. SQL Server Help for reports is useless as Crystal has its own separate Help. As demoed in our local UG, MS has just released its own Reporting Services module (free download) to supplant the highly regarded Crystal Reports.	2004-03-07

The actionscript section has four chapters and 240 ppgs, about one quarter of the book. There are two comprehensive projects at the end of the book where you can integrate all that you have learned, at a beginner and intermediate level (actionscript). The final chapter covers 70 pages.<br />The CD has QuickTime5 videos for visually describing subjects using Flash MX. These videos are large near full-screen sized and are competently produced. The videos cover the subject, but don't repeat what is in the text. The CD also contains a 30day eval version, along with QT5 Player, eval Sorenson Squeeze for videos, and Flash Shockwave 6 MX Player plug-in.<br />The subjects are illustrated well with diagrams and illustrations. There are 16 pgs of color plates at the back. This book provides a very good value; I read it at the local library. Minor errata is at the author's website and you can email him at derek at derekfranklin dot com. Three appendices are wisely on the CD; keyboard shortcuts, resources, and third-party SW.	2003-10-23

I was surprised to see so few books on the subject in Amazon and in the public library. More than half the book goes into the risk assessment and no cost loss prevention. Fine...but the cover claims that the reader can design a security system and install camera surveillance.<br />The first author may be a wise policeman and attorney, but a systems designer for a home / small business security system he is not. The co-author is just a writer, has very little experience in the security field and has obviously not designed, installed, and armed a security system herself. There is a lot of common-sense discussion and fluff on alarm components in the book.<br />But when the rubber hits the road, this book runs out of gas. The DIY section of the book is Chap 17 and covers 21 measly pages. There is no typical bill-of-materials, budgetary costs, or national or regional sources and part numbers for popular items. Where is the beef?<br />Honeywell is a national provider of security components and systems; the authors don't discuss the security industry suppliers, not even Radio Shack. I'd recommend going to an on-line catalog that the Pros use at ADILink dot com. It doesn't even go into the popular X-10 components for home automation; except in the last paragraph in Appendix B.<br />The overall organization of the book with tips and sidebars are very distracting. Overall this is a disappointing book that I read at the public library.	2003-10-23

Very little is given on suppliers, components, and systems based in the States. I'd highly recommend going to a Honeywell affiliated website ADILink dot com for the security products in the US. You have to register to get pricing.<br />Though what she goes into is in detail and gives both pluses and minus and discusses component alternatives with diagrams, tables, and drawings. Where she falls downs in is the control box or panel. There is only a light discussion on the alarm controller in Chap 9 in one page. She relies on Chap 13 which covers the British Stds, BS 4737, on alarm systems, some 9 pages worth of specs-not really useful info for the systems designer or installer.<br />Furthermore, her Chap 14 covers a SureGuard alarm system complete with circuits with transistors, diodes, capacitors, switches, and power transformers. Certainly she doesn't expect a home owner to build this! Evidently this is not available in commercially or in a kit form. Her final chapter is on smoke detectors and fire extinguishers. I read this book at the local library.	2003-10-23

I was lucky to find one working in one of the lessons on the CD. However, I had to go to another of his books (0-7645-1637-X) in order to see what is in the custom component!<br />The QuickTime lessons are about 5 min long and are well produced and suitable for the topics for quick learning; watching the video clips is often faster and more lucid than reading the text. If you have them playing in the background, you probably can pickup some tips by osmosis ;-). I read this book at the local library.

His book is eminently readable using a classroom metaphor. He includes dialog with typical student questions and exercises sprinkled throughout the book. His approach is quite unique as far as typical computer training books go, much better than the Dummies, Idiot's, TY24hrs, and similar genre. He includes a classroom project (p12) with dialog with a Client (p5), a real project (p35), interactions of VB with the hardware (p71), OS (p76), as well as VB itself.<br />The book has 15 equally weighty chapters, with first 4 chapters on project definition and classroom dialog, 2 chapters on the VB GUI, OOP programming covering 6 chapters, an error handling chapter, and the last chapter on the Win Registry. There is an 8-page index. There is no CD that contains the project code by chapter or a listing of the completed project, however his website johnsmiley dot com has the downloadable code and pics in the freestuff area.<br />Using the \\"there is no such thing as a dumb question\\" metaphor, his mythical students ask the most innocent, yet meaningful questions at appropriate times. This can reinforce the learning process. He also explains concepts using real life processes too, such as VB events (p152). This becomes real important when introducing OOP concepts and contrasts it with procedural programming used with older Basics. He also adds sage advice such as \\"Ten-Step Guide to Successful Interface Development\\" (p 158-9).  He also doesn't forget the ColorDialog and Timer control (p178-9) and explains his \\"Hungarian notation\\" for a naming objects convention (p146).<br />Variables are introduced in the middle of the book in Chapter 7. The VB variable properties are further explained in Chap 8 and the project's VB prototype code is finished herein. The author also has surprise visits from the Client show up to the classroom, typical of a real-world client. The last programming construct explained is Arrays and a simple 3-dimensional array is added to the project code.<br />In his next-to-last chapter 14, error handling is covered with a list of 11 common beginner errors. Then he shows how to construct free form and structured error dialog boxes. Then he applies these concepts to the project. Last but not least, he shows how to incorporate into the project by saving preferences into the Registry and program optimization by creating functions and Call procedures.<br />Throughout his book, Smiley includes the client, project, and classroom metaphor. He gives the students and client a personality and presents intrigue with surprises, disappointments, frustrations, rumors, joy and successes. Similar to what happens on real projects. I read this book at a local library and highly recommend it for the beginning VB.net programmer.	2003-09-17

We have been always looking for a capable web enabled report writer without integrating a third-party product, such as Crystal Reports for the Web. DotNet Forms promises in creating at least simple, yet dynamic, multi-paged reports without a whole lot of work.<br />DotNet provides for creating dynamic Excel-like forms for ASP.NET html. Additional form paging provides for DB presentation similar to Yahoo and eBay searches, which is a familiar and intuitive format. DotNet provides these DataGrid forms with the DotNet Forms API. The API architecture is listed in the last two-thirds of this book, which is an inch and a half thick.<br />While the authors claim to include a \\"very fast-paced\\" tutorial (p1) in the first third (313 pgs) of the book, the DataGrid portion is a mere 6 pages (p307-312), very steep indeed! I'd highly recommend its combined use with another MS Press book by Dino Esposito (0-7356-1578-0) which devotes about half of his book to DataGrid reports and code examples. Another is Jesse Liberty's O'Reilly book on VB.Net (0-596-00438-9) which has one chapter devoted to ADO.net (34pgs).<br />The publisher include a MS Visual Studio.Net Add-in on the accompanying CD which has the text of the book as integrated help files, 1.7MB MSI files for VS.Net 2K2 and 2K3. Appears a tad bit small? I have not tested the usefulness of the claimed dynamic integration of the O'Reilly Help files along with MS Help during coding process within VS. It appears that this is the initial product enhancement from this publisher. I wonder if an annotatable PDF file of the book would be more useful; at least this would be in a separate window. This tome was read at a local library.<br />At a local SQL Server Users Group meeting, a new technology that will embellish on the DataGrid and Forms was discussed and demoed. It is the forthcoming SQL Server 2K Reporting Services that will be a low/no cost add-on for SQL 2000 Server and authoring with a Visual Studio.Net 2003 download. It currently is in beta and will be released in 4Q03. It appears to be XML based and production reports can be rendered for browser, printer, PDF, and TIFF output. What a seemingly great idea.<br />Overall, this detailed 469-page reference on the DotNet Forms API appears needed for the programmer, although this is probably duplicates what's available on a MSDN subscription CD somewhere. The appendix includes another 69-page API term cross-reference and a 23-page index.	2003-09-17

With 2 chapters and 43 pages on installation, its general procedures are next to useless. There is no specific distribution and hardware so at least your installation can be modelled from it.<br />At least there is a few hints like using Fdisk with /MBR (p88) for dual boot Win/Linux machines.<br />Almost all of the book is oriented to the command line within a terminal window. The book shows a Windows GUI, Xfree86, Chap 10-11, and Gnome in Appendix B.<br />I have yet to find a book that makes it straightforward to fully configure a Linux machine with SCSI, sound, network, modem or router, tape backup, CD-RW, USB, FireWire, scanner, photo, HP printer etc so that some real work can be done with StarOffice, Netscape web &amp; email. (Doing things that can be done on Win98SE without breaking a sweat.)<br />However, I still recommend finding a local Linux User Group and going to an InstallFest (Twin Cities, Minn has a group supported by the Univ of Minn, EE/CS Dept). I have attended one but still didn't have a fully configured RedHat Linux 9 Server up and running yet.  After the 2nd InstallFest, I got my TR-4 tape backup functional and Palm sync'd.

US	52766877	R229ULQ4GZMCQS	0764516604	246362988	Linux For Dummies (For Dummies (Computers))	Books	3	31	31	N	N	Still not good enough for Linux Newbies	I read LeBlanc's 4th Edition book to see if it has been improved enough for Newbies. It is not. While including two CDs that have RedHat Linux v8, its installation section is still woefully inadequate with two chapters of 40 pages. For example on p22 the authors say that if you have Dell, Compaq, or HP, you should have no problem. In my experience with Compaq Presarios and HP Vectras, they use custom mobos, BIOSs, chipsets, sound, and win modems that will conflict with Linux. Another example on p31, the authors write 2 inches on video boards and monitors, the Achilles heel for getting the Linux GUI up and running.<br />The authors' best suggestion (p65) is to get help from a local Linux Users Group; available in large metros; such as Minneapolis which meets monthly at the Univ of Minnesota's renown Computer Science and Electrical Engineering Dept! How can you get better help than that? They also have a daylong Install-Fest twice a year. I agree that this is the best way, but what about the rest of us (p2) which is this book's target audience?<br />After researching, reading, and buying a half dozen books on Linux installation, I have yet to see a book that shows a cookbook approach for the Newbie. It would be based upon a reference computer hardware set that has been chosen for it's popularity and compatible processor, motherboard, cards, and devices. Since one can easily find and cheaply buy used, legacy components on eBay, used computer stores, electronic swap meets, flea markets, and garage sales, installation procedures could be simplified and would be direct and to the point. And be guaranteed to work! It would avoid the tons of frustration and wasted time by reading and attempting to follow all those books and Linux HowTos which are so generalized that Newbies finds them totally confusing and absolutely useless.<br />Case in point, almost all Linux authors (p14) pride themselves that Linux will run on older, legacy hardware, probably what is in their DOS and Windows hand-me-down pile. However for a Newbie, they want to use a modern GUI, not type into a CLI. So in attempting to use this legacy equipment, the Newbie will run into the most common problem, which is carefully not mentioned by Linux writers, that the X-Windows probe for video board and monitor is not very robust compared to Microsoft Windows. Visually identifying chipset models on video boards and finding monitor sync information is one of the most critical items, yet it is rarely emphasized with step-by-step explanations and photos of reference hardware. The Newbie is not shown how to decipher the actual spec listings of popular hardware, locating the important parameters, and ignoring all the rest.<br />Another example is dual boot (p26) Linux along with Windows, a common Newbie configuration. Again almost all Linux authors, including these authors, gloss over the interactivity required on the boot blocks by reconfiguring the MBR with the MSDOS Format command. Wannabe Linux users will find that just because you have a computer working in DOS, WfWG, or Win9X, etc, that it does not translate to a slam-dunk in installing and configuring Linux.<br />The Newbie just isn't aware of the behind-the-scenes sophistication that Microsoft developed for Windows installs. Overzealous Linux authors don't warn the Newbie that incredibly more work is necessary to technically understand the details of each component. And if that component manufacturer has gone out of business, then avoid it with a ten-foot pole for his first Linux box.<br />It now comes full circle that a reference hardware installation cookbook is sorely needed. Chapter 4, Installing Other Distributions, includes installation notes for Caldera, Mandrake, SuSE, and Debian, which is superfluous for the Newbie. These 10 pages could have been put to better use with a hardware cookbook because if the Newbie couldn't get RedHat v8 to install, then (s)he certainly wouldn't get the others installed either. The install troubleshooting Chapter 18, of ten (10) pages, is woefully inadequate and full of one-liners (jokes). The CLI log-in screen is here in the back (p296); why not in the install section on p62? <br />Back to my purpose in reading these authors' book, I was expressly trying to find how to switch to the KDE GUI since RedHat's default GUI install is GNOME. The authors say (p84) that it is easy to switch and they have a Chapter 6 (p86-97) which explains the differences and similarities between the two GUIs. Yet the authors never tells HOW to switch; the Table of Contents, sidebars, icons, 20-page index, were all useless. The RedHat and GNOME Help were useless too.<br />The critical thing that the authors left out was the GUI log-in screen, which had no pix. Although I discovered the secret with RedHat Linux 9 (March 03, Shrike release), the GUI log-in screen has a \\"Session\\" button along the bottom row. I had previously ignored them; but lo-and-behold! It is for the GUI startup selection. A serious omission on part of the three authors.<br />An important area that the authors discuss adequately is the systems administrator account and user accounts, explaining that Newbies can crash the system (p98) by an inadvertent keystroke (mouse-click). The Linux OS can be pretty fragile as a root user. But further explanation of the superuser, especially application superusers, and users & groups is not well explained. As listed on p286, important applications that attract Newbies to Linux in the first place, such as a Samba fileserver, an Apache webserver, and MySQL and PostgreSQL databases are not covered at all.<br />And last, but not least, the authors put in another one-liner to install and use a tape backup (p308) because Linux will fail, you just don't know when. The authors omitted installing a tape drive, neither using the Tar nor Amanda tape backup utility, nor explaining the disaster recovery process. From authors who have umpteen credentials, this last omission is almost unforgivable.	2003-07-29

It's key info is needed to quickly defeat Diablo. I wrote this review after winning Diablo as all three characters; swordsman, archer, and sage, over 6 months as a single player. Diablo won the 1996 game-of-the-year by the computer mags and is phenomenal game that one grows to appreciate its complexity as you get better.<br />In a nutshell, Diablo is a first person shoot-em-up game against 19 classes of enemies. Diablo stays interesting as the 16-playfield layouts change for each game and the 1000s of creatures have a complex variation of personalities, strengths, and weaknesses. The first 4 levels have sprawling layouts of Dungeon rooms; levels 5-8 have Catacombs which are smaller layouts of rough rock walls; levels 9-12 are Caves with large excavations and meandering streams; and the final 13-16 Hell levels are laid out as interstitial quadrangles. The game play is a nice blend between isometric 3D visualizations, character animations and sounds, and multimedia video clips.<br />With this book, playing success is an exercise in developing strong Diablo problem-solving skills. Initially looking on the Internet for Diablo cheatz which were few as its a legacy 6-year old game. What this book provides is info and strategy that can help you defeat the myriad of creatures and quests. My book has become a much thumbed, reread, indexed, and enhanced with scrawled notes on how to defeat them.<br />For example, I found that the easiest character to win was the Rogue archer-woman and won Diablo in 3 games, as archery is a distance scenario. The next easiest character to win was the Warrior swordsman, completed in 5 games, mainly because of hand-to-hand combat experience as a kid. The most difficult character, of course, was the sage Sorcerer, which took me 9 games to win because of the myriad (26) magic potions that need to be mastered. This book gives you an informal discussion and tables of characteristics without all the trial and error. Although it discusses general tactics, it is weak in overall game strategy and specific tactics on specific minions.<br />This book provides details on the power of weapons and armor and strength and weaknesses of enemies. It also covers the 17 special Quests quite well. The author writes in an entertaining prose and presents key info is in complex tables. I found that Blizzard's production release of Diablo v1.04 and internet update download to v1.08 was very stable and reliable on a P5/233MMX, Socket7 PCI mobo TX chipset, ATI Rage PCI video, 64MB RAM, 52X CD, 10GB HD, and SB16 running Win98SE.<br />The book is divided into 10 chapters including the making of, but has no index or glossary, which is a serious beginner's omission as the game's jargon is voluminous. There could have been a List of Tables too. And these tables could have had summaries or group breakouts so that the many character(s)(istics) are better organized. The screen shots could be larger and less dark. I bought it at a local used bookstore and the game at a garage sale. Of course, certain key subjects and data tables had erroneous or omitted information.<br />Each game is saved in the game folder as single_X.SV, where X is 0 to 9; ten games max. Thus create a historical archive subfolder and keep old and partially played games there. Second, game files vary from 200KB to 3MB. So burn game files onto a CD, email, or save on a Zip to impress friends and foes. Finally, do judicious saving for replaying level(s) that eventually went sour. Use the keyboard Ctrl+Alt+Esc to toggle to Windows for making notes and performing file maintenance.<br />To win maximize building experience points and accumulating gold and key special weapons. Finding, identifying, and redeeming EVERY single weapon, armor, chest, scroll, staff, book, ring, tomb, library, and shrine on every level to maximize your power. Often the first 5 levels and what you accumulate therein can give you a premonition on the final outcome of the game.<br />For example, the Sorcerer is quite vulnerable in the beginning and the player must strive to play almost perfect levels. Waste the least amount of resources on the minions and don't let them touch you. Learn to run away and lead them into a trap. Accumulate and convert your operating weapons and armor from standard to special ones. Sell as many of the std weapons for health, mana, and ID scrolls from Adria, the Witch. Buy ID scrolls from her as much as possible compared to paying Cain to ID. Categorize the specials and unique weapons and armor into red and blue (fire and lightning resistant), in rows on the ground so that best combinations can be easily selected. Run a pre-level scouting expedition to find what's new on each level. Return to town near the beginning of each level and always re-visit Adria. Apparently attacking minions on a new level triggers her to provide a new list of scrolls, books, and staffs. Accumulate and deploy key fire, lightning, and mana shield spell books rapidly, compared to duplicative staffs and scrolls which are redeemed for more gold. Spell books, and their cumulative power from multiple units, will affect later quest outcomes. If it is taking too much to finish off a minion; its probably because you are doing it wrong. Finally, Quests do not have to be completed serially; do the first five levels without doing the Butcher and King Leoric. Then when stronger and with Arkaine's Valor armor, return back and efficiently finish off the buzzards. Use fKey to Holy Bolt for dealing with skeletons, zombies, King Leoric, and finally Diablo.	2003-06-17

While not done in the same mole variation as Trilling shows on p261, they were called the same on the menu board. They had a homemade creamy red salsa available on request too.

While this unusually organized cookbook is separated into microclimates of Oaxaca, a small state south of Mexico City, I found the chap 7 on Tuxtepec as having the most savory sounding recipes.<br />Be aware that this cookbook is quite vegetarian and fish oriented, for example, in chap 6 for the mountainous region of the state, there were 16 recipes with only one with meat. There were no menudo recipes or any recipes with variety meats, such as calves' foot, tongue, and tripe in the entire book.<br />I found her book at a local library along with Diane Kennedy and Rick Bayless.

The book's descriptions are diverse in central city, suburbs, provincial environs, as well as covering common aspects of China travel. Lots of practical advice and categorizing tourist expenses into budget, medium priced, & first class. This book has 22 pgs of photos and 9 maps with marked key lists. The photos go well beyond the media touristy stock photos to include children, people at work, everyday scenes, empty freeways, but no massive bicycle or bus traffic jams which I'm sure exists.<br />About the first half of the book included general history and descriptions, getting there, and getting aclimated. Then the back half of the book has specific discussions on diverse topics from the usual hotel, eats, and entertainment, to shopping, expat & gay bars, and children's activities. There are many warnings that all things in Shanghai are expensive, more than the US. There are day excursions to famous Suzhou (Venice of the East) and Hangzhou (West Lake) which are very touristy with the natives. There is only one visit \\"off the beaten path\\" to Putuoshan, an island and overnight ferry about 150mi SE. <br />The book is well made to stand the rigors of travel, bound in signatures, so pages and maps won't drop out after the spine has flexed with rough use, or maps can be carefully razored out for separate pocket use. The 8-page language section has the essentials, including the word for toilet and toilet paper and the men and women characters on p57. I wonder if pronunciations can also be given in Shanghainese dialect as it appears to be Mandarin.<br />The most objectionable format issue was the 6 pages of publisher's advertisements (p212-218) which were stuck between the glossary and index, and maps with site lists at the end. These adverts should be placed in the foreword or left out. And the inside of the front and back covers are non-functional, adverts in front and metric conversions in back. They could have been maps and not-to-be-missed sites. And the metric conversions did not include conversion of area, esp sq meters to sq ft and sq km to sq miles.<br />Having read Yatsko's New Shanghai (0-471-84352-0, 2001), which has no maps and only 4 pgs of stock pixs, I was anxious to see more. I was pleasantly surprised. When trying to locate the famous Fudan University, however, I was disappointed that there was nothing in the index, which is a scanty 4 pages, with only a few Chinese locations. After scanning the map's key lists which are not indexed, the only Fudan U entry was the last entry on the last page. This turned out to be wrong. In the Harvard U based Let's Go China (0312270348, 2001, p281), I found an obscure reference to take Bus 910 to Wujiaochang, a NE suburb as discussed on p63. Only after looking at the MapQuest-like city map at ShanghaiGuidedotcom did I find Fudan U's location, whose own website had a campus map in Chinese and no street address or directions, a common mistake with website designers. Wujiaochang is a traffic circle, like in DC and Boston. Fudan U is just west of it on Handan Lu. Fudan U could have been marked on Map 3, which includes Tongji U and Shanghai Normal U. This area needs to be emphasized of its location and proximity to the Pudong SEZ.<br />As a reader of the author's prior co-authored book, Odyssey's Uzbekistan (962-217-582-1, 99), I considered it excellent in photography and description guides and sidebar stories.<br />As a feature LP has a website to support its books, however the support area is not linked from the home page. Only after searching LonelyPlanetDotcom was I able to locate the upgrades area, but they did not have any updates for China (Taiwan, Japan, and Central Asia had Acrobat PDF files).<br />This book was written within the round-eye tourist and expatriate's perspective. For the squinty-eye overseasChinese, those able to blend-in and reading and speaking Mandarin, Taiwanese, or Cantonese, I'd like to see your coverage broadened to include dirt-cheap accommodations and native business interests, especially in the Pudong SEZ and other high-tech areas similar to the Zhongguancun SEZ in Beijing. Or at least include a detailed list of resources, websites, or tourist guides written in Chinese.	2002-11-04

It has a couple ways of repairing worn photos and a small fun area that includes turning a photo into a pencil sketch. There is a very short 2 1/2 pg index.<br />It did not, however, include any information and techniques for using PSP with scanners and digital cameras and inkjet printers, which I think is a significant omission. For example it did not include any information in scanning or transferring a photo as a 1024 x 768 pixel image and tell you the better ways to get the best 5x7 photo printed off on a 1200 dpi inkjet printer. In fact scan and print is not in the index, although scanning is touched on in the photo repair section (p157).<br />There is a section on using 3rd party PhotoShop compatible filters (p137, 165), such as Alien Skin and shareware. In the end there is some troubleshooting on deleting the registries (p169). There is no capability comparison with Adobe PhotoShop or other image editors. I read this book at a local library.	2002-11-04

LP is not a book with pretty tourist stock photos. If you want pretty pictures, I recommend the Insight Guides which have at least 1 per page. After looking at a half dozen Beijing (BJ) city guides, this book excels again in describing Zhongguancun, where others fail.<br />Zhongguancun, (Zgc) is like a Chinese Silicon Valley, or computer business development area near Beijing and Qinghua Universities (p149-50) in the older 3rd edition. Zgc is an important hi-tech area for tycoons, business, and consumers alike to find computers and software localized for China. It is located in the Haidian District, NW Beijing, near Haidian Rd and Zgc Rd following the 4th Ring Rd, far outside the Metro ring. Zgc is just south of the Old Summer Palace area. This area is probably best accessible by bicycle, taxi, light rail, and bus. It is about 4 miles (6km) NW of the northwestern-most metro ring station at Xizhimen. Zgc is listed in the index.<br />In the Insight Guide (p198), I saw a Zizhimen light rail stop about 1 mile away from Zgc.<br />LP/BJ 3rd ed (0-86442-547-3), also has a two maps to get a good view of Zgc and the downtown districts, Map 3 for overall Beijing and 10 for the Haidian district. Map 10 also shows the Zgc bus stop with nearby hotels, restaurants, internet cafe, brewery, and universities. This edition has 11 maps. <br />However in LP/BJ 4th ed (1-86450-144-8), Zgc is still listed (p53). Zgc is lost in the maps with only 7 maps, ersatz replaced with 20 pages of pretty stock tourist pictures. I believe LP's editors have stepped in the wrong direction here. Lets hope that they get it right before the 08 Olympics. I read this in the local library.<br />I noticed that LP/BJ 5th ed (1740592816), with a new author is scheduled to be released this month, 10/02.	2002-10-30
US	52766877	R2G2TX32XHRPVJ	0060005998	375642585	China Dawn: The Story of a Technology and Business Revolution	Books	5	5	7	N	N	A fast paced Venture Capitalist tale, CCP ready or not	The author is a Wired / Fortune magazine reporter with 25 yrs experience and he spins an engaging story about developing the internet infrastructure in China with native Chinese financial and technical talent. The author has written his book in a multi-layer fashion, not unlike a Tom Clancy novel. This book includes an 11-page index, but lacks any further footnotes or bibliography on this nascent market. There is no map or timeline summarizing key events, as the author weaves several interrelated stories spread throughout his book. Also there is no government / company hierarchy chart, like the popular charts of Silicon Valley company spin-offs, so it is confusing to keep the players straight.<br />Starting in 1992, his story centers on the development of 3 main characters about 3 years after Tiananmen. Tiananmen galvanizes these young men's patriotism while studying in the US, leading them to discover their purpose in life. What surprised me was the government's vision towards rapidly installing broadband internet and voice over IP capability. Proactively before admission to the WTO, a government contract was let to a start-up managed by young entrepreneurial Chinese who had their own vision that the internet would catalyze \\"Democracy with Chinese characteristics.\\" Of course, the CCP wanted the internet because they needed a catalyst for enhanced communication for Chinese companies to compete globally.<br />Bo Feng (b 1969), a native of Shanghai with teachers for parents, was sent to California at 18 as his stop of last resort in 1987, as his family despaired from his lack of ambition. At 21 years old, he drops out of the College of Marin, a local community college, bitten by the creative freedom with making films and storytelling like a budding Spielberg. He works in Chinese restaurants to fund his films (p36). He gets married to a round eye, and his father-in-law introduces him to the investment community, and soon gets hired in 1994@25 by Sandy Robertson, one ofthe Silicon Valley tycoons (p52). He works with Robertson to provide mezzanine financing for AsiaInfo $18M and SRS $7M in 1995. As Robertson retires, Feng sees a need for seed capital, so with Eric Li founds the Chengwei Venture fund...with $60M in 1999, lead by Yale, Sutter Hill, Stanford (p179). Eric Li, a UCB BSEE and Stanford MBA, had prior VC experience at Orchid Asia Holdings. This is just before the internet dot com bubble bursts in Y2K.<br />Suning (Edward) Tian, a native of Beijing, now the CEO of China Netcom Corp..., a privatized Chinese government start-up in 1999 with the mission of laying the national fiber network backbone. In Jan 2001 about a year after breaking ground, he is visited by China Premier Zhu Rongji for an hour presentation and he pleads for a broadened licence (p268). Born in 1963, from bourgeois scientific parents, he was raised by his maternal grandparents during the Cultural Revolution (CR) (p25) and his estranged father after. He places very high in the college placement exams and enters LiaoningU, Dalian, to study biology after his parents, with grad work at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing (p29). At 25, he leaves China to study at Texas Tech, graduates with a doctorate in ecology, but he finds his true calling in a college basement computer lab with a Macintosh (p31). Appalled by Tainanmen, he and fellow ISTI/Beijing, UCLA EE/CS techie sidekick Jian (James) Ding (p46) found BDI and create a Chinese pro-Democracy news website. He translates the Western news sources and becomes the first popular alternative web news source outside of the People's Daily. They rename BDI to AsiaInfo to become a Dallas portal/ Beijing provincial SW and network provider that later went public on the NASDAQ (ASIA) in 1999. AsiaInfo evolves into a general web portal, like a Chinese grown Yahoo, but operates in the States near UT Dallas.<br />On the mainland, a BDI subsidiary does network systems work. One of their first projects was automating the Shenzhen stock exchange for $2.2M in 1995 (p69) using Sun computers. For SW, they modified free Unix Open Systems shareware. They also established the first internet backbone over voice lines between Shanghai, Beijing, Guangdong and the West in 1994 for $4M (p70). Then they expanded it into ChinaNet, the national backbone over voice lines in 1995. Then Shanghai On-line wanted a website, portal, and local infrastructure developed for $3M in 1995. Running out of expansion funds, they meet Feng, who underwrites an $18M expansion as his second deal for Robertson, Stephens (p81) in 97. AsiaInfo is on its way towards becoming the dominant player in China's internet.<br />Wang Zhidong, the co-founder of Stone Rich Sight (SRS) in Beijing, created RichWin in 1996, a Chinese translator shell around MSWindows. He is a son (b1967) of Guangdong peasants, started working on radios in HS, and won a full scholarship to Beijing Univ, EE lab. He discovers the Computer Lab and switches to CS. Soon he is freelancing in Beijing's Zhongguancun. He makes an Adobe-like DTP and OS SW for a BeijingU spin-off. He teams up with Yan Yanchou, who started making Chinese IBM PC clones in 1983 at the National Research Inst (p60). Yan makes the 1st word processor using Chinese characters; using his video controller with a custom ROM (1985). They found SRS funded by the Stone Group (HK) in 1987, created RichWin with Feng's 1st deal of $7 million of VC in 95 (p64), becoming the defacto Chinese GUI OS by 97. They create SRSnet.com, for RichWin support, and later acquire Hong & Lin's Sina.net and morphs into a Yahoo-like portal (p88) in 1999 and has an IPO (SINA) in 2K (p208) in the midst of the dot com crash. After MS releases a Chinese Windows OS, it regains its world domination in 2001 (p264). With no source of revenue, Daniel Mao, a VC, fires Wang. Smarting from the loss, Wang starts up Dianji Technology with a new mission.	2002-10-22
US	52766877	RE0K9E1CM31SC	1930110197	725923053	Microsoft .Net for Programmers	Books	5	5	6	N	N	An excellent introductory real-world book	All that is necessary to start programming using dotNet is the free download dotNet SDK (137M, 7M SP2) from MSDN and the source code (200K) for the book at Manning.com. In fact the author recommends holding off getting MS Visual Studio DotNet because he feels that it gets in the way of learning (p xiv). The SDK contains the MS C# compiler; the book has a 30-page Appendix A as an intro to C# language. He indicates in the text (p xiv) that VisualBasic.net and C# are getting very similar syntaxically, so the reasons to choose one over another is blurring. Most of his examples includes both. So you can hold off on that $1K expense for VStudio dotnet, or use the cheaper MacroMedia Dreamweaver MX... P>The client browser needs to be at IE 5.01 or later and Net Framework RT1.0, MDAC 2.6 RT, need to be installed which contains the framework libraries necessary to display the enhanced attributes of dotNet. The client OS can run on Win98 and higher. Your Win2K Server needs IIS 5.0 + security upd, and MDAC 2.6; a legacy WinNT4 server needs SP6a updaters and MDAC.<br />The author has a tutorial that quickly goes from the ubiquous hello program to a video poker game metaphor to illustrate how to use object oriented C# techniques with COM, IE, ADO.net, XML, Client/Server, Remote Services, SOAP, Forms, ASP.net, and finally a WAP based program. What a tour de force!!<br />Although this book is as comprehensive as possible in a short 300 pages, after listening to a local MS SQL Server UG on ADO.net, one needs a thicker reference for heavy lifting. I would highly recommend Dino Esposito's \\"...ASP.net and ADO.net\\" (0-7356-1578-0), for more content oriented websites. It has the most comprehensive description of the wild and woolly Data Grid.	2002-10-22
US	52766877	R3I7H8V5TITPXX	0679454845	402745839	China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Inc.: The Dynamics of a New Empire	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Written on the eve of HK repatriation	The author is a Dutch journalist for a Dutch newspaper based in Asia for twentysomething years and his book was translated into English a year later. Over 5 years ago, he wrote with a provocative title; similar to vanWolferen, an author (0-394-57796-5) who popularized the mgmt-speak: \\"Japan Inc,\\" along with Business Week magazine, in the mid 1980s, when megaconglomerates (keiretsu), such as Mitsubishi and Sumitomo, were conspiring to conquer the world again, this time economically instead of militarily after WW II plus 40 years. Then later Mark Clifford wrote (1-56324-386-5) of a similar business conspiracy being duplicated with the chaebols of \\"Korea Inc,\\" such as Samsung and Hyundai, after the Korean conflict (1950) plus 40 years. I found that this author has written a profound analysis on a potentially unified China (PRC+HK+TW), and interprets recent history to show the reader how China could set a similar course since the Cultural Revolution (1975) plus 40 years. Although he is a westerner who knows the native language, he appears to give a more neutral, less biased portrait of the emerging giant.<br />While not explicitly claimed by the author, his experience in reporting about China has started in the late 70s, first from Indonesia and then in the Chinas. This means that he observed the China ferment since the Cultural Revolution. So his writings must have included the Gang of 4 (79), the Four Modernizations (80s), Third Line Project (relo key defense industry away from the vulnerable E coast), and Deng's Reform and Opening (92). His book includes a 3-page bibliography, 18 pages of notes, and a 14-page index for further study. From his vantage point, he could eavesdrop on the whispered goings-on in the CCP and Taiwanese governments in order to validate what is eventually released to the propaganda machines.<br />Of the key areas in his book, Chap 3, over 30 pages are devoted in describing the westernization of Taiwan, yet he weaves in the overall strategy usedby the PRC so that Taiwan will eventually return to the fold (p112). And in Chap 8, a 12-page analysis on why Taiwanese were allowed to create wholly owned factories in the Xiamen SEZ, directly across the Taiwan Straits in Fujian province, PRC. This book is great because it identifies the younger CCP lieutenants that one needs to watch as they gain experience and power. Furthermore in the 13-page Chap 13, he discusses why the greater HK / Canton / Shenzhen SEZ / Guangdong province area will be the first megalopolis that truly will embrace capitalism with Chinese characteristics. The industrial infrastructure is alive and well all united with the Cantonese dialect; the 5th ASEAN Tiger is ready to move. And finally in 15-page next to the last Chap 18, he explains the changes in politics, society, and culture that will take place during China's coming out period that will last through this decade. The author and translator have created an understandable read, one that has deciphered the seemingly conflicting news bytes that are in American press. One that makes it easier to see the forest and the trees, yet helping the reader understand the telltales so you can watch them bend as the wind blows.<br />Just this year, I see that Wal-Mart is selling refrigerators made by Haier, which is direct from the emerging Chinese capitalists in the PRC. This is the first consumer harbinger with a PRC brand name. This breaks the tradition of OEM contract manufacturing, first of clothing, shoes, and toys, then upscale to TVs, VCRs, and stereo gear. Now China is superceding the OEM manufacture of high tech computer components which are in-magnanimously buried underneath the \\"Intel inside\\" sticker on PC cases, which have been made in the PRC all through the 90s. The \\"Made in China\\" sticker is being flagerantly and ubiquitously waved in front of the world.<br />Undeniably since 2K, the march with \\"China Inc\\" has begun. After taking some lessons from history and reading van Kemanade's book, it becomes obvious in predicting the events to come. As aptly alluded to in David Sheff's new book (0-06-000599-8), the WTO gates have rang open a year ago (9/01); the modern Marco Polo shall be wise to heed the new adage, \\"Go east, young man, go east to China!\\"	2002-10-11
US	52766877	R2ZIHL0PVTTIVB	039448231X	599267617	The silk road: A journey from the High Pamirs and Ili through Sinkiang and Kansu	Books	5	13	13	N	N	A look at the Silk Road 25 yrs ago	For a classical book on the Silk Road devoted to western China, this is a very well crafted book on their car travelog in 1976, over 25 years ago, just after the Cultural Revolution. As Swedish reporters, the author and Gun Kessle, wife / photographer, work well as a team and their book quality shows. The pictures are excellent; the translation is excellent. They completed their journey into China, which initially started in 1959 but had to turn back due to altitude sickness.<br />Their travels start in central Asia, in Tajikistan, which is just north of Afghanistan, and enter China in the provinces now known as Xinjiang and Gansu. Their style of writing emphasizes the people, their industry, and their cultural history. It includes lots of local information on their economy, including agriculture, industry, natural resources, population, roads and rail infrastructure at the time. This book concentrates mainly on Xinjiang. Only about 1/6th of the book is on Gansu province, and its capital Lanzhou, the Yellow River and Liuchia hydroelectric dam, and the western stretches of the Great Wall. There is a discussion of a new iron mill, new key bridges, and optical industry which are sensitive strategic assets at the time. <br />If you can read another contemporary assessment of the region, then you can get a balanced perspective in what changes and advancement have taken place. Since the Silk Road has been a trade route for millennia, the author weaves in ancient history and bring the reader up to speed with British holdings in India and Pakistan, and Sino-Soviet boarder issues at the time.<br />There is a 10-page introduction into silk culture. They also talk about the subjugation by the PLA Han Chinese on the native Uighur population at the different oasis / cities.<br />The book does appear to be a mouthpiece of the Chinese propaganda machine as there are many facts and numbers that one needs to qualify the source of such info. Still it gives a frame of reference that you can compare to the author's own experiences and those of other writers.<BR>-------------<br />Paul Theroux wrote a 28 page chapter in his popular book \\"Riding the Iron Rooster\\", Ivy, 88, 0-8041-0454-9, when he visited the area from Lanzhou, Ganzu to Urumchi, Xinjiang by train in 1986, a decade later. He has his best dish of all China in Urumchi, a deep-fried, steamed chili, smoked duck, p189 pbk. <br />For information on the Silk Road extended into Central Asia, I refer you to Calum MacLeod, etal, Uzbekistan: the golden road to Samarkand, by Odyssey, 1999, 962-217-582-1	2002-10-01
US	52766877	R32XM7E9RW8XYQ	0375420592	120379170	Red Dust: A Path Through China	Books	4	18	23	N	N	An existential self-portrait	The author is a native Chinese artist, which makes it hard to understand his prose as he shifts from the present, past, and dreams with many people talking. But after you get through his own primal needs, back-pack and shoes, food & cigarettes, and sex, alcohol & drugs, then your mental filter is set to read the story. Just read every other paragraph and you won't dwell on the insignificant. This book is unusual in that it is written by a native 30 yr Chinese who is on an extended tour starting in 1982 (p17); quite the opposite of a tourist book written by a round-eye. <br />His writing is really a rambling diary of his bumbling, dirt-cheap, 3-year vagabond tour around China, crashing on and bumming off of friends of other literary or journalist's friends. He is part writer / journalist, part photographer, part poet, part painter, but can't do anything very well (p42), other than shagging women in the same boat. Other women are quite wary of him. One laughs wryly, \\"The quickest way to commit suicide is to marry an artist (p215).\\"<br />His travels start from Beijing, west via train to the deserts of Qinghai, south to Chendu and east via the Yangtze river, then north to Xi'an and further to the Genghis ruins on the desolate Shaanxi steppes along the Yellow river. South through Sichuan and east to Qingdao his birthplace, south along the coast to Shanghai, Canton, Hainan, inland to the Yunnan minority regions, Golden Triangle, and finally Tibet. Certainly a long trek, some with humanity and much in solitary. The situations that he gets himself into can be interesting otherwise it's daily page filler. Sort of a DIY manual on how to hitch for a ride, how to sleep with a roof overhead, and how to sponge a cup of tea or meal off of dolting peasants.<br />Sometimes he tries amusing scams to earn some spending money, such as, becoming a street barber in Qinghai (p107), selling pot cleanser for tooth polish in Shaanxi (p199), and help setup a Yunnan minority peoples exhibitionin Canton (p208) which of course is a desperate flop, as the Cantonese are much too busy making money to come.<br />There is a map of his travels on the inside F&B covers (HC), and there are 8 detailed map / drawings heading the chapters. There are no pictures in his book, even though he carries a camera through his trip. He carries the camera mainly to impress his credentials as a journalist (p272) to the local authorities, at least enough to get a meal and an overnight bed.<br />He spends some time in Chendu, to recharge, party with the local literati, and witness the new economy in western China. He talks to new graduate staffers that are slowly mutating into the cynics like himself (p141). Fleeing his shadow he continues his journey to sacred Buddhist sites (p156) and visits an infamous prison at Chongqing. He sees the posted executions list, which ironically reminds him of witnessing an execution who turns out to be of a former lover of his ex-wife (p160).<br />Once more, yearning for cleansing deprivation, he hikes north to Xi'an and the Yellow river of Inner Mongolia to visit the ageless ruins of past civilizations. Once more penniless, he drops in with the local literati, including a film studio and dance troupe, all local closet dissidents, and earns money as a magazine illustrator for a spell. He sees a museum of 2,300 stone tablets that chronicles classical Chinese history and philosophy (p170) and interviews recovering opium addicts in a state sanitarium (p177).<br />He visiting his parents, siblings, and birthplace in Qingdao (p205) by the Yellow Sea and he remembers his childhood and how he was a selfless disciple of Chmn Mao. Somehow he has mutated into a rebellious ne'er-do-well with a 7 year itch, who divorced his wife, child, and leaves a mistress who jilted him, to travel throughout China before escaping to the West probably under the guise of political persecution. He keeps in contact with everybody by letters and asks respondents to send them to his next friend-in-the-trade.<br />Of the redeeming factors for this effort is that you visit areas that no round-eye tourist would ever see or visit, let alone talk about. At the start in order to purge his bad thoughts of Chinese socialism, he walks across the Gobi Desert to see the buried ruins the Grotto of 10K Buddhas (p76). He endures a 1 week long dust storm, then suicidally sets out again, and nearly dies from thirst, crawls into a swollen salt lake; he almost becomes a relic as a tenderfoot walking the desert. Much later, he takes a bus into the Yunnan minority region jungles and learns about reusable burial grounds. He crawls through the jungle, sleeps in trees, and passes by aboriginal huts whose inhabitants are just afraid of him as he of they (p266). When he needs to cross a river in the rain, he finds a raft and single-handedly makes it across within an inch of his life (p276), then he has to climb out of the river gorge before nightfall...makes it to a village and is interrogated and house-arrested. He escapes and continues his journey to Tibet.<br />In Tibet, he tries to get close to Buddhism, visits with a Han who has exiled himself there and who has learned Tibetan. Now his sidekick, he tries to learn the ways of the monk, attends a sky burial (warning: very gross p311), makes a preposterous attempt at Mt Everest, and finally he drops as a hospital case of diarrhea & dehydration. Denouncing his vagrant life and exhausted from his trek and misery, finally cleansed and survived the privations of his spiritual pilgrimage (p 105), he returns to civilization.<br />Definitely a modern Chinese Don Quixote, Don Juan, and Dissident Don, he finally finds himself and tells us after recovering for 15 yrs in Hong Kong and London. He says that having money is the key to freedom (p105), yet having money is a quick route to Spiritual Pollution (p223). If you are looking for an existential view of China, then this book is for you, which I read at a local library.	2002-10-01

Hunan is an agricultural area and an important higher education center just north of Hong Kong, his POE. His book is one of the first on contemporary Communist Chinese as a personal venue.<br />Although he studied Mandarin and Cantonese in school and was familiar with reading the language, he could not understand the local Changsha dialect. As he teaches English, he gets tutored in the local dialect, kung fu, and calligraphy.<br />Through his teaching classes, his approach is stylistically American with an informal style with a verbal situational emphasis. Most of the students are used to the classical Chinese style with rote learning which makes it tough for the students initially to adapt to. I wonder on how this style of teaching is going to be sustained in China?<br />He quickly grinds through the typical dialog of 3rd world culture shock, eg staring crowds, filth, latrine stench, insolent bureaucracy, packed buses and trains, etc. Because of his fluency and Sino interests, he gets invited to many impromptu teas, lunches and home dinners with people he meets in the college, in the city, and along the river. He gets to sample a lot of home cooked Hunan spicy cuisine and rice wine.<br />He has a common bond with Chinese men because he also is skilled in the martial arts, wushu, a style of kung fu. At least he thought so, yet he relearns it in China under a famous master and 3 other teachers with differing styles.<br />Homesick, he comes home during summer vacation, but travels to Shanghai and Suzhou looking for western food during the 1st lunar New Year, missing milk shakes, coffee, and chocolate the most. He stays in China the 2nd lunar New Year and travels down the Yangtze to Hangzhou.<br />His prose is easy reading and the cultural vignettes he writes are wry and amusing at times. He writes about 25 short stories which are about 6-8 pages long on a variety of topics. However, they do not cover a long enough time period and he doesn't develop the characters deep enough to really savor the differences in culture and attitudes. There is no maps or pictures even though the author has a camera.	2002-10-01

I wonder if his name is a pseudonym.<br />When you read his book, appearing to be well documented from a financial journalist's point of view, you get that sense of futility for multinationals ever being successful in China. Perhaps this is because this is the beginning of a new era, Reform and Opening. However, I find that he really doesn't delve beneath the gloss, bright lights, and high expectations of multinational mgmt. He inundates the reader with all the financial minuate, but in my mind he doesn't impact the reader with the most important conclusions. This book misses the mark.<br />He fails to conclude, write or understand that multinationals will not make it in China (other than the cellular telecom co). That this feeding frenzy of the 1990s is just a sham, like taking candy from a baby. He doesn't say it, but the rise and foundation of the new mainland China will be from the \\"renegade\\" Taiwanese companies. He also forgets history of the Opium Wars, where the imperialistic UK and other Europeans forcibly opened China. He doesn't say that this has indelibly embarrassed the Chinese and will not happen again. He doesn't present the conclusion that the new China economics is Socialism with Chinese characteristics done by the Chinese themselves. <br />...<br />Notes, bibliography, and index total about 1/5 the book.

Actually describes how Chinese think	If you have been looking for a contemporary assessment about how the new Communist Chinese proletariat thinks, then this book should be on your short list. Books about the rising Chinese middle-class are far and few between. This book centers in a small river town along one of the largest rivers in central China, far from the hyper-cultures of the coasts or Beijing, with scenarios revealing a more forthright appraisal of contemporary China.<br />The author, now working in Beijing, is a 3rd generation Italian / Irish, 27yr old round-eye (p229) from a small town about 100mi from the Mississippi River, St Louis, Missouri, who volunteers for a 2yr Peace Corp stint teaching American & English literature at a small local teachers college in a city famous for Fuling hot pickled mustard tuber (p210). From the start in 1996, he crafts a dialog of his journeys and experiences on his laptop (p62) and diary; this is not an after-the-fact memoir. Shunned by his Chinese teaching peers (Dept of English p61, 295, 337), he concentrates describing in intimate detail the thoughts, missteps, triumphs (p49), and fears of his students who come from peasant stock (p24). Furthermore, Ho Wei, his Chinese name (p237), insists on being tutored in Chinese (p60-67) over the two years to enhance his understanding and discourse in the local dialect when he ventures off-campus.<br />He ventures far beyond the typical touristy culture shock dialog of staring crowds (p65, 381), open latrines, propaganda (p38, 59, 78, 220), two-tier pricing (p190), lavish banquets, bureaucracy (p73, 334), begging (p31, 304), macho drinking (p80), endless train and boat rides (p216), gambling (p367), pollution (p62), noise (p328), saving face (p201 318), yada, yada, yada that one gets in most 3rd world travel books. He carefully crafts many interludes, from solitude and peace and quiet (p192), to Rip vanWinkle comedic skits (p170), to the pandemonium of students giving a Spanish play based upon Don Quixote. The play,part of a college-wide competition, was produced by the students and became an irreverent satire on Chinese culture and college life was being reviewed at the dressed rehearsal stage. Of course, the political overtones were such that the entry was immediately banned by the Dept Dean via the college's Communist Party Secretary (p372).<br />He concentrates on his students thoughts that are written in diaries and class papers, from fear, loosing face (p49), love (p271), public sentencing (p75), identity (p282), crying (363, 398), suicide (p273), new free enterprise (p275), abortion (392), prostitution (p241), to the emotions of daily life, abet all the good and bad of our society too, but from a unique Chinese perspective. Many vignettes, often quoted, compare the differences and similarities between Western society and Communist Chinese in the student's own words. Definitely an illuminating read.<br />The book has 3 maps to help give perspective of the town, Sichuan province, Chengdu its capital, Chongqing, the birthplace of the Revolution, the mighty Yangtze River, and the Three Gorges Dam (p99) which will soon inundate the town. There are no pictures in the book even though the author has a camera (p385) and they videotape scenes (p380) at the close of their stint. He travels during the summer off to Xi'an, north near Inner Mongolia, and west along the old Silk Road. He was visited by his Dad and younger sister who had an internship prospecting for oil in the western Xinjiang province.<br />The book also delves in the personal tragedies that some of the student's parents had to endure during the Cultural Revolution (p20, 198, 290, 315, 363). The author also struggles with his own conflicts for this PC stint, to escape a career in academia (p45), avoiding pretentious elitism (p276). He discovers censorship of his letters to the USA and endures political informants to his Dean's file and police dossier (p174). He faces the Good / Bad Cadre excuses when trying get permission from the Admin to present a topic that is inadvertently political (p334). Long distance running helped him escape frustrating stress (p71), yet winning brings him lasting notoriety in a 4K (p89) with 2,500 field from the college and town. He suffers severe sinus infections from the air pollution, looses hearing in one ear due to complications, and partial eyesight in one eye. And finally he fulfils his destiny, a journey to China spawned by his maternal grandfather (p229) long, long ago.<br />The author also weaves modern Chinese history, Long March (p57), Taiping Rebellion (p53), Opium Wars (p169), Cultural Revolution (p224), Third Line Project (p330) into his narratives and shows how recent history affects the student attitudes. He also relates both political and social issues on a personal level, such as Democracy (p143), Socialism, Capitalism (p249), Reform and Opening (p187, 252), Shakespeare (p33), always with that added euphanism, \\"with Chinese characteristics.\\"<br />Many Communist activities ... are presented from a personal point of view, including Deng Xiaoping's death (p135), Hong Kong's repatriation (p180), Long March (p7), even Hitler & the Jews (p233), and personal rituals of annual events, like family Memorial Day (p154) and Chinese New Year (p294).<br />After reading this book, you will see with fresh new eyes the contrasts between America's enjoyment of freedom of expression, pro and con debate, and ... theories, compared to the Chinese one-think. You will see the effects of Communist China's mass ..., effects of mentioning political and social taboos, where everybody thinks alikefor their personal survival is at stake. Odd-eggs and dissidents are ostracized and, when necessary, eliminated.	2002-09-27
US	52766877	R2BMFHZQ2QKEJ	0972078630	807069965	Discovering Fusebox 3 with ColdFusion	Books	3	3	8	N	N	Easy read on CF Fusebox 3	This is an introductory book, auspiciously indicated on p21, directing you to give this book to your management to justify a Fusebox job. The tutorials go through an 8 page Hello World trivial example and then a more complicated Contact Mgr example that consumes about 30 pages. The author on p47 indicates that a real developer will look for Jeff Peters, etal, Fusebox: Developing CF Applications 0735712697, supposedly for a beefier book. About 51 pgs was taken up with Fusedocs. Overall, this book looks at Fusebox from a top-down, forest-before-the-trees approach, which it does well.<br />The book is organized by a paragraph number which is an unusual style for this fledgling publisher. And there is a tremendous amount of white space. Fusebox is introduced and discussed in an easy-to-read, comfortable style. Unfortunately to go through the tutorials, you have to download the code from the techspedition.com website. While not difficult to do, this book should have it on CD, perhaps an e-book too. I did not work through these tutorials or work though the code snippets to find any errors; perhaps later. <br />However, no where does it say that Fusebox is a coding methodology AND that there is no added software box that needs to be purchased [currently]. So Fusebox is free of any out-of-pocket expense. I raised a question to one of our CFUG Fusebox presenters, on the number and size of files that is inherent in using the Fusebox architecture compared to a project's customary CF code. He couldn't or wouldn't, and this book does not answer this question or address a project's architectural concerns either. This may become significant as one does real-world projects.<br />This book was received free in a drawing at ColderFusion.com UG 9/02 meeting. I have attended 2 prior meetings where Fusebox was a topic. One was a promotional seminar given by the author.	2002-09-19

Cheap and Easy!,)	Books	5	13	14	N	N	Excellent, even for the uninitiated homeowner	It is pity to see all the legacy refrigerators going to waste. You can see the appliance store back lots filled with them and garage mechanics selling fixed ones for $150 in the WantAds.<br />This excellent book with lots of illustrations beats out books from Time-Life, Masters, OEM mfgrs, and others. The author has already been there and done that...he doesn't need a big publisher masthead and lots of high priced editors and photographers.<br />Refrigerators are really quite simple but there are some trouble-prone areas which includes icemakers. It has good detail diagnostic flow diagrams so you can determine which subsystem or component is bad.<br />In my case for a 20+ year old Frigidaire with top mount freezer intended to be used in an office, where a new one costs about $600. This fridge cooled great at first, but after about 1-2 weeks would not cool or freeze any more.<br />With this book, I easily diagnosed that a defrost heater was burned out, p37. With its good illustrations, was able to take apart the freezer section, lift the evap coils, and find the heater. Described it (1\\" dia x 17\\" long) over the phone to a appliance parts store. Picked it up for $27, and voila! it is still running after 3 months.<br />I read this book from the local library and also saw another book by the same author, \\"Refrigerator Repair Under $40,\\" ISBN 1-884348-00-9 which has about the same content. Highly recommended, would not been able to save this fridge without it.	2002-09-17

I found this boring and a rehash of other travel books and the usual lurid history. After reading less than half of this chapter, I flipped to the last chapter about the Yangtze headwaters in the primitive Himalaya-like mountain ranges. The story is more exciting and less covered compared to most travelogs, although both Theroux and Jenkins have written similar stories. With Winchester, however, I learned much more about the geography and history as I continued reading backwards. There is enough repetition throughout the chapters that each can stand on its own.<br />Each chapter has a detailed submap so that the reader can follow along and not get lost. The front and back covers have a highlighted map of China so that one does loose sight of the big picture. The text and map includes a discussion of the Yellow River too, and for perspective comparisons to features in the US and UK. However, there are no tour pictures, other than his full-page mugshot on the back dustjacket, even though he brought a Leica [p32].<br />Winchester's book includes more than a typical travelog, he intersperses vignettes that include geography [his undergrad work is geology] and temporal history. These vignettes delve into their subject at more than cursory level in tour guides, so that the reader has a deeper understanding into the whys and wherefores. Such vignettes include Chairman Mao's swimming the river, the Three Gorges dam project, minority peoples, tea, Wuhan bridges, Precambrian Yangtze man, Chinese holocaust museum, Lu Shan, etc. Unfortunately, the vignettes are not listed as subtopics in the TOC so that it is hard to relocate them. I'd highly recommend that the author take a look at computer books for useful TOCs. There is a 9-page index and 5-page annotated suggested readings list. Quite a few pages have footnotes that help the reader recall/learn lesser-known facts, but I would have really wanted anumerical list of endnotes so that the reader could further research topics of interest. Many indented quotes and poem translations are unfootnoted. There is a pasted-in correction of the text [p260].<br />The author, an emancipated Brit, tries to write in an American frame of reference, but many Brit colloquialisms show through; such as lift [elevator p163], ship-breaking [-wrecking p43], railway wagons [cars p198], Perspex [Plexiglas p59], notice board [sign p140], etc.<br />His writing style is typical of a reporter, who exaggerates describing scenes with overly powerful and emotion-charged phrases. The reader needs to filter these excesses, as in:<br />\\"In places like these the water is not so much water as a horrifying white foam--a cauldron of tortured spray and air and broken rock that is filled with the wreckage of battered whirlpools and distorted rapids and with huge voids of green and black, the whole maelstrom roaring, shrieking, bellowing with a cannonade of unstoppable anger and terror [p 333].\\"<br />Water is a person and has anger and is afraid? Need I say more about his allegorical attempts?<br />Other writing issues include his freelance writer upbringings, measured by # of words, such as:<br />\\"They take this runoff from the high Himalayas and the other ranges and then, capturing river after river after river along the way--all of which do just the same, scouring their source mountains for every drop of water they can find--they cascade the entire collected rainfall from tens of thousands of square and high-altitude miles down the earth-stained waters of the East China Sea [p144-5].\\"<br />I kid you not but here is a 70-word sentence, part of a two-sentence paragraph. He'd flunk English 1B in any university class. Clearly this book had no editors as this is his typical writing style.<br />And this book is full of excessively erudite phrases, such as:<br />\\"Trading companies are crammed into dusty art deco palaces and crumbling godowns; there are real estate brokers and paging firms and couriers where once there were more classically Chinese functionaries, 'likin' officials, octroi collectors and compradors [p208].\\"<br />Hint, there is no glossary.<br />Curiously, from the world's outcry on the demographic moves, and cultural and environmental damage alleged due to the 3 Gorges dam, the geocentric author does not show a dotted outline that the resulting 360 mile long reservoir would cover although the author claims to have detailed DoD secret topographic maps [p xii].<br />Overall, however, this book is a compelling read. One just hope it is all true [p xiv]?? Since the 2008 Peking Olympics is in the works perhaps a 2nd edition is forthcoming? [page# refer to hard cover edition]	2002-09-07

The book is his memoirs on a 1-year stint teaching American lit in China in the late 80s. As an illiterate, incommunicado, ill-prepared, ethnocentric Minnesota round-eye with dubious Scandahovian heritage, he tries to explain a 50 something idiosyncratic Communist China. The author's point of view is from an overweight, middle aged, unmarried, intellectual with no children [himself one of China's unmentionable damn ninths]. The era is after Mao's Cultural Revolution where China was coming out of its isolationist phase under Deng Xiaoping, just before its pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen, and prosperous capitalism with Chinese characteristics of the 90s. The author ostensibly and defensively disclaims anything other than to be a personal travelog on the back cover and introduction.<br />This book is a collection of essays, trying to subvert his tired, same-old-drivel, Anglo cliches into an authoritative dictionary format. Each definition compares and contrasts China with a smooth and creamy Minnesotan hot dish, with bulked-up dialog that is analyzed-to-death, backwards, upside down, and inside out, ad nauseam. Certainly a hunk of butter could have provided an easier enema. Attempts at humor were by jumping on a tube of Aquafresh. The book has 250 pages, no pictures or maps, and the introduction is huge 30 pages. And because of the format, many scenes and factoids are repeated throughout the book.<br />In his typical 3 page vignetted definitions of Chineseness, the self-centered, exhalted one claims that his green AmEx card cures all ills. A single paragraph on staring mobs, latrines, yellow dust, corruption, two tier pricing, bureaucratic insolence, yada, yada, yada. Indeed, a detailed table would do...but then no book. Half of the subjects were based in the ancient city of terra cotta warriors where he taught and the other half is his travels into, out of China, down the Yangtze river, in Singapore, and back in the ol' US of A. The book does not discuss his actual job of teaching very much. The more memorable, pleasant experiences center on food, dim sum, tasty veggies, and very ducky banquets.<br />I am amazed to see how so many MN Foundations were conned to support this out-state ersatz college American lit professor's charade to get this work published, read: vanity subsidy press. I read his book from a local library in his home state which has many copies.<br />As an alternative, I'd highly recommend Peter Hessler's Rivertown, 0060953748, 2001, who does the same thing teaching English/American lit for 2 yrs as a Peace Corp volunteer. Covers the same ground but crafts his rewarding teaching experience into a cohesive story. As for travels, Paul Theroux's Riding the Iron Rooster, 0-8041-0454-9, 1988, does a more credible [450 pages with map] job during the same era [16 wks on NYTimes bestseller list].	2002-09-07

Has Yin and Yang of foods, contrast between Western and Eastern concepts of nutrition and food harmony, 30 common ailments that can be helped by food (again by Western and Eastern concepts), and over 60 intermediate level recipes.<br />The two authors do a good job in integrating such a complex topic and simplifying it for cooks to embrace the overall Chinese wisdom for TCM in everday life. It helps to have some prior experience in cooking Chinese, as there is not too much on the art and technique. No pictures or illustrations.<br />I saw a similar book which is more complete, Nina Simond's &quot;A Spoonful of Ginger,&quot; at double the price. It has pix and explains concepts more thoroughly.

Previously I read and tried melatonin, with no success. Finally a protracted illness lead me to search again. The author gives enough details on the plant, pharmocology, and ethnobotany. There is eight pages of full references for additional research, if desired.<br />Went to a local health food store / COOP with the book in hand and had the staff present the different brands of Kava in stock. Finally selected a Kava tincture because a salesperson / user said that this is the best form, compared to powdered root, capsules, and other standardized extracts. He said you will get the fastest and most powerful effects with this tincture, especially since the label said it was extracted from Vanuatu Isl 4-8 yr old roots. He was right on target; the tincture gave a white cloudy mixture when a couple of dropperfuls in 1/3 glass of water. It tasted pretty musty, as expected from reading about the Nakamals, native kava bars!! Got a slight numbing of the tongue too! Fell asleep within 30 minutes and did not wake up for 6 hours, refreshed and alert. The next best thing to being there with the author, who wrote a great story.<br />My first time using tinctures. Normally I use capsules or try to make a tea out of the bark or root. The book told me of the uselessness of making a tea, as heat destoys the kavalactones.	2001-01-21

I used it to uncover new restaurants and cuisines, especially authentic, unpretentious, inexpensive ones, whenever visiting the Big Apple.<br />It is great when you go into neighborhoods where they just don't speak English and often new immigrants (natives) on the street or over the phone are too myopic in giving directions.<br />It is great for the NYC visitor as exploring Queens and Brooklyn by subway doesn't come without some intrepidation, especially in the evening. But after qualifying the areas that I do know quite well, Little Italy and Chinatown, I read areas that I recently visited Koreantown, Manhattan and Little Columbia in Jackson Heights, Queens. I now value the insight and comprehensive amount of research the author presents.<br />Each ethnic group has a clear vignette on when they came and settled, the reasons for immigrating, noteworthy aspects of their culture, political and religious organizations, and restaurants, markets, shops, museums, and cultural activities. Some 500 pgs worth!<br />He gives a lot of practical info, phone numbers, hours open, specialties, so that when you are on a quest, you can find it. Lots of factoids and city trivia are sprinkled everywhere. Many opinions were on the mark. Good index.<br />The first reviewer needs to read more thoroughly: a) Russian Jews in Brighton Beach, p 223-8; b) Germans in Ridgewood, Queens (next to Glendale), p 55-7; c) even a random tourist like me knows that The Bronx starts at 140-150th St, a typo.<br />My main critique is that the author could have included simple &quot;bigger-picture&quot; maps showing the neighborhoods and Metro stops to make it more tourist friendly. While he gives general directions on where they are located, often I couldn't determine which borough it was in.	2000-12-27

Unfortunately a printer is very complicated mechanically and taking them apart is very tricky. This book is not practical.

There is no discussion on important  printer options, such as ethernet print servers, PostScript, duplexers,  power envelope feeders.

It doesn't also cover in any  depth what an eMail administrator needs to know and does not cover Claris  OfficeMail v1. This book has been available on eBay and other closeout  computer book sellers.	2000-01-10

I can't speak for this particular volume, but I have a volume &quot;Diagraphics II,&quot; 12/94, ISBN 4-931154-21-2, 328 pgs, Y19,500. It  is one of the best volumes on modern graphics communications.<br />It is  primarily a compilation of graphical designs published around the world.  Just great to get design ideas. It has sections on Graphs, Statistics,  System Diagrams, Explanatory Diagrams, Tables, Maps, Encyclopedia  Illustrations, Dissections and Medical Illustrations, Creative and  Statistical Illustrations.<br />There is a previous work &quot;Diagraphics  I,&quot; published in 86, at Y20,000<br />I got mine at a used local bookstore  in the Graphic Arts section, for US$37.50  Since it is a large format  portfolio book, I am sure it cost much more, at today's exchange rate, it  is more than US$150.	1999-03-22

Hardware is covered particularly well, motherboard details, monitors and video resolution, memory SIMMs, Video memory and 3rd party video boards, Ethernet, Nubus/PDS slots, SCSI, and printer issues. Lots of pixs, tables, and diagrams. Gives a comprehensive list of startup issues and resolutions, 32ppgs!<br />The book answers many repeated questions that I see on the Macintosh newsgroups, when hand-me-down computers are given a new lease on life! I am amazed that so many people want to do revivals and upgrades!<br />I find it invaluable as a Mac DTP Systems Engineer. Much easier than scanning back issues of MacWorld and MacUser magazines. The book's index is 55 pages! I have used it for 4 years and it is quite marked up, with many added Post-it notes and scribbles.<br />Que, 94, ISBN 0-88022-960-8, 1012 ppgs, $35. An absolute must have if you can find it in a closeout bin, or used bookstore.<br />Now if a sequel of comparable comprehensiveness would become available, covering PCI Macs, Mac clones, and G3, a gargantuan task...	1998-06-25

However, one's body does require some essential fats. Also fats are added to many processed foods. And restaurant food has lots of fat so that it tastes good. <br /> It would be great to find out which fat sources are better than others, from a health point of view. This book goes further than most to give you a readable analysis on choosing the better fats and incorporating them into a lifelong diet. <br /> My review is especially for the previous edition pub in 89, now out of print.	1998-03-10

As a reference in How magazine's  3/98 article on wayfinding systems. I found it better than Edward Tuftes' trilogy of Visual Display..., Visual Explanations..., and Envisioning Info.... &lt;para&gt; I think that this essential reading for a technical oriented designer.	1998-03-09
