Drawing on a combination of scripture, scholarship and the words of great thinkers past and present, Harold Coward evaluates six major world faiths and their attitudes towards pluralism and religious tolerance. balancing the historical context of each religion with its responses to the modern pressures of globalisation and multi-cultural living, he tackles complex and problematic areas in an accessible manner, to produce a succinct survey of the issues and arguments surrounding inter-religious relationships. Among the key topics covered are: Muslim relations with the West and white Christianity; the Jewish Diaspora within the multi-cultural world; assimilation and mutual criticism within Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism; the future of religion: possibilities for reaching new levels of tolerance and understanding. A timely book, this introductory text should be of interest to students, academics and the general reader alike.<br /><br />Contents reflect the diversity in Seven Chapters: Religious Pluralism and Judaism; Religious Pluralism and Christianity; Religious Pluralism and Islam; Religious Pluralism and the Baha'i Faith; Religious Pluralism and Hinduism; Religious Pluralism and Buddhism; Religious Pluralism and the Future of Religions.<br /><br />I recommend this multifaith resource to all public and academic libraries.	2005-08-22

His evolutionary religious taxonomy specifies five stages: primitive (e.g., Australian Aborigines), archaic (e.g., Native American), historic (e.g., ancient Judaism, Confucianism, Buddhism, Islam, early Palestinian Christianity), early modern (e.g., Protestant Christianity), and modern (religious individualism). In the modern stage of religious evolution, the hierarchic dualistic religious symbol system that emerged in the historic epoch is collapsed and the symbol system that results is \\"infinitely multiplex.\\" In this posttraditional situation, the individual confronts life as an \\"infinite possibility thing,\\" and is \\"capable, within limits, of continual self-transformation and capable, again within limits, of remaking the world, including the very symbolic forms with which he deals with it, even the forms that state the unalterable conditions of his own existence.\\" <br />read more: [...] <br /> <br />An interesting perspective on Protestant Work Ethic applied / tested in other cultural setting.	2005-07-20

Localizing Knowledge in a Globalizing World is a collection of essays addressing the on-going crisis in area studies: \\"The object of the Five Colleges faculty symposium Global-Local: Revisioning the Area Studies Debate, 16-18 October 1998 at Hampshire College, Amherst, Massachusetts, was to reflect on the current state of area studies in some of the regions where such studies flourished traditionally\\" (p. 14).     Twelve essays bring forth contributions by sociologists, anthropologists, historians, political scientist, etc. Incidentally, these proceedings are published after five years. As a result, a generation gap (rather a changed era, given the widening difference between the pre- and post 9/11 worldview) might raise eye brows. An answer to these, however, is not found in the book.     The book alerts us about a misplaced status of local knowledge within a volatile globalizing atmosphere (that tends to drift towards transnational / borderless states). In order to get out of the crisis by accepting the realities, the symposium suggests a strategy, including first, identifying opportunities that may help reduce ethnocentricity in the existing academic framework, and second, revitalizing the current curricula and research programs:    \\"The fluid concepts of globalization can be made more precise and meaningful only be being grounded in area studies. It is precisely the relationship between global processes and area-based knowledge that opens up new perspectives on globalizing societies, nations, and cultures. Viewing globalization from the vantage point of particular localities necessitates the displacement of totalizing theories of globalization with the recognition that globalization has assumed diverse forms connected by unequal power relations\\" (p. 13).    Localizing Knowledge in a Globalizing World will be a useful addition in any area studies library. In addition, those who wish to browse more on globalizing and localizing perspective, will benefit from a similar title, viz.,.

First, it demonstrates that activism and decision-making are two dominant zones in Cyber Islamic Environments (p. 205). Second, it deals with changes in the post 9/11, reflected in sacred cyberspace (p. 2). Third, as I see, it goes in the deep Web to trace the e-content's human face. In fact, Bunt made history by writing Virtually Islamic --the book in hand is a sequel. <br /> <br />Bunt's analysis of the tacit knowledge, converts intangible information into tangible, which thereby becomes a model for return on investments in today's volatile e-world. Cybrarians, Sociologists, Middle East specialists, religionists, Orientalists, historians as well as public policy makers, will greatly benefit from this model developed by an active scholar-cum-Netizen. Any library that specializes in religion or area studies should possess it for their circulating collection, as it is more useful for a complete reading to get a clear picture of the emerging dynamics, whether it is `religion in Internet' and `religion on Internet'.	2005-05-29

Dr. Melody Ivory offers an analytical view of what works in automated evaluation of the Web site. This analysis brings a value added perspective in terms of understanding the invisible Web logs. It comes at a right time when the spider's web has progressively become semantic Web (i.e., a web of intentions, seamlessly connected, and synchronously networked in the global village).    Based on so many detailed studies, Ivory's work is also focused on two pillars of Web infrastructure: viz., accessibility and usability. Within this framework it serves as a source to understand best practices. Hopefully, businesses will apply Ivory's findings and avoid another burst of the bubble. Also, Automated Web Site Evaluation systematically highlights input, thruput and output for creating, developing, maintaining and sustaining the web site. With these advantages, the book can be a handy tool for researchers, practitioners, and developers in the web domain. Inhibitive price for individuals apart, software or Web evaluators in particular, readers in general, or a novice designer in this field will find this book, Automated Web Site Evaluation, far more beneficial.	2005-04-08

Thanks to the catchy terminology, `independent business owner,' that charisma tempts everyone. To give such an audience a peace of mind let's clarify: the book in hand is neither about a home-based business's quick money making tips, nor it will show short cuts to an earlier retirement in life.  <br /> <br />Bates & Basch's Building & running a successful research business (henceforth, A Guide) is a detailed tool for information-research industry demonstrating `what works' as a case in best businesses practices. As against the charismatic movement, a goal of the information industry is avoiding magic, hype, and illegalities (see: Ethics & Legalities, chapter 15). With this conceptual framework, Bates skilfully presents a compendium so much essential in today's volatile economy. A Guide has added value, because it comes neither from a theoretician, nor from an idealistic visionary-the book is a true story of what happens while \\"launching, managing and growing an independent research firm\\" (A Day in the Life of an Independent Info Pro, Chapter 2). This book, on the whole, reflects the ever-growing convergence of infostructure--print, digital content, media, medium and message. A description, `about the book,' may summarize A Guide's depth, extent and intent: <br /> <br />\\"This is the handbook every aspiring independent information professional needs to launch, manage, and build a research business. Organized into four sections, \\"Getting Started,\\" \\"Running the Business,\\" \\"Marketing,\\" and \\"Researching,\\" the book walks you through every step of the process. Author Mary Ellen Bates covers everything from \\"is this right for you?\\" to closing the sale, managing clients, promoting your business on the Web, and tapping into powerful information sources beyond the Web. Bates, a popular author and speaker and a long-time successful independent info pro, reveals all the tips, tricks, and techniques for setting up, running, and growing your own information business\\". <br /> <br />I would strongly recommend A Guide because it explicitly serves as a standalone resource, especially for the potential prospects. Readers who were unable to get a total solution in Florence Mason's Information Brokering (New York, Neal-Schuman, 1998), will definitely benefit from Bates's work--comprising far more creative content and innovative techniques of information visualization. In addition, A Guide has also lessons of history for info pro practitioners, knowledge workers, publishers and vendors. <br />	2005-03-14

May be this book is too early for a historian of modern / western spirit. Herein the use of the term Modern and / or Western, includes whatever its correlation, overlaps, convergance and divergences, as discussed in the book (see chapter twenty: Modern vs. Western, 291-309).     Is it possible to conclusively see any growth pattern just after a single decade of economic liberalization? May not be. This probablity is just not hypothetical, rather the book is written at the end of five decades of Indias paradoxes. It took forty years to highlight conclusively the result of Nehru's 'third way' (p. 295) -- a third way which tried to combine Russian, American and others -- \\"In the End, the third way failed. Even before Nehru died in 1964\\" (p. 295).    A land of leading contradictions, with highly rich and extremely pour, loaded with corruption and moral degradation aspects, may not show indicatioins of real progress in long run, rather these are serious obstacle towards progress.     In short, India has inherent economic and social contradictions and hence, it is too early-- may be another few decades later -- one can say if India in reality is bound or unbound, based on a longer time period.	2005-03-01

I find the book more useful for students of library & information science, with plenty of tabulated / illustrated useful themes, such as, Knowledge worker (p.9), comptence building (pp. 131-132), intangible capital measuring (p. 216), job fulfillment & ROI (p. 33-34), etc.    contents:   1 Worker as Investor: A New Metaphor   2 Human Capital Investments and Returns   3 Human Capital and Competitive Strategy   4 Hiring Human Capital Investors   5 Setting the Stage Through Workplace Environment   6 Paving the Way for High Investment   7 Building Human Capital   8 Holding On to Human Capital Investors   9 Optimizing and Measuring Human Capital Investment     Davenport reminds succintly, \\"people are not costs, factors of production, or assets. They are investors in a business, paying in human capital and expecting a return on their investment.\\" In order to make human capital work, as effectively as possible, this CEO stresses on the fact that the management must make sure that people understand how the organization becomes successful--i.e., only with humans, humans and humans--NOT with the old currencies of capital, assetts, credits, and debits in the ROI and ROA.    The weakness in Davenport's book is is that it focuses on professional investment ONLY. Professional and personal mind as a whole gives a fuller picture. Whereas, ignoring the personal side,  leads to lopsidedness. An individual investor has his / her energy, synergy and soul contributing in workplace-- they are not Just Robots. Those who are looking for such a holistic picture have to look elsewhere and in other books. My listmania, at Amazon has many titles which facilitate looking at the investor in a holistic sense.     This listmania is facilitating accommodation, tolerance and striking adjustment among the co-investor, among the teammates, etc. 'Religion in workplace (religious practice in work hours)' (...)      Nevertheless, Davenport gets the credit of making this idea so explicit and obvious: \\"worker is an investor,\\" wherein the worker (oops, investor) is a free bird, with an added power to negotiate with the board, or get out whenever negotiations fail.	2005-01-16

Contents: Indians in North America; Independence and Conflict;    Immigration to North America; Making a New Life; Keeping the Culture Alive; Human Smuggling and Worker Exploitation; Future Immigration; Famous Indian Americans/Canadians; Glossary;  Further Reading; Internet Resources; Index.    About the book: An overview of immigration from India to the United States and Canada since the 1960s, and particularly since the technology boom of the 1990s when highly skilled professionals came seeking better incomes and opportunities than they could find in their homeland.An overview of immigration from India to the United States and Canada since the 1960s, and particularly since the technology boom of the 1990s when highly skilled professionals came seeking better incomes and opportunities than they could find in their homeland (source publisher).     The strength of the book is in its coverage, which is (by and large) credible, authentic, and from a neutral perspective, by way of illustrating how a community is striking a balance in a foreign, but adapted, home. The contents, in short portray two rays: a) major faiths that have Asian-Indian colors; and b) experiences of people, in their struggle, pains, labor, success (example, IT boomers, technology exporters, or Indian teachers, p. 52) and failure (human smuggling, the picture of an illegal immigrant in American jail on p. 86).     The weakness of the book is it tries to cover too much in a small space, about an immigrant population that is the second largest in the continent. In this sense it is a research work, but useful to a school student. It cannot be taken as a reference work for advanced study.     History and historiography needs facts and figures, which can be corroborated, NOT by way of gossip. An issue relatesto few textual / contextual matters. For instance, a picture carries a note of the burnt train that led to the Gujarat riots of 2002, and the note states the train was bombed by a mob (p. 29). A word about the bombing is pertinent. No worthy source has used the word `bombed,' in reporting this riot. There are theories of burning the train from inside, or from outside, NONE says about bombing. This subject is sub-judicial as of this date, and interests all human watchers.     In trying to be neutral, the book however does not highlight the neutral contributors in the North American Mosaic. Many secular and democratic efforts, by educated and enlightened Indians, continue to contribute their might in making the ends meet. The utility of the book would have been enhanced, if it had separate chapters on US and Canadian narratives-because the twain are not identical in many respects, such as, laws, opportunities, treatment towards Multifaith multicultural and multilingual communities, etc. A socio-pysco-lignuist, searching in this book for accent, acculturation, adaptability, and so on, will have to look elsewhere. Vegetarians will be happy to find some food for thought, but Halal foods for Muslims, and Jhatka food for Sikhs is absent. Further, in this book, Canada gets less than 20% coverage. And in cataloging Canadian contributions, missing content includes first, Haroon Siddiqi (the award winning journalist, editor Emiratus Toronto Star); second, Rohinton Mistry is a writer who makes up a part of the Indian diaspora    A misnomer is the title, per se. In America, Indians are natives who are the real Americans (or call them local inhabitants of the continent), and NOT immigrants. The title of the book could be Asian Indians, Immigrants from India-to be precise and communicative-a title not just for publicity stunt.    As a Fulbrighter, and who has worked in identifying bridges across Indo-American cultures for over a decade, my book, Indian Contribution to American Studies (co-author: Dr. Mohammed Burhanuddin. Delhi: Anmol, 1997), has much more to offer in understanding how Indians--even if these Indians do not land in America-are, nevertheless, contributors to the glory that is and the grandeur that is emerging in the West.

There is no question on restricting to theoretical foundations. This is not the issue. A text book can focus either on theory or practicum. Whatever one does, thebook has to be readable and digestable.  <br /> <br />The bottomline is over dozes are better avoided.	2004-12-19

Visual people look up to see things. Audio people's eyes bounce between their ears. And kinesthetic people look like they have inferiority complexes. They look down a lot and pull up their feelings from a well inside. So if we are not sensitive to these three channels when we prepare and deliver homilies, we are loosing bunches of people. I really believe that Jesus was visual, audio, and kinestheic--he told stories that provoked powerful feelings and emotions and that also contained powerful, challenging ideas. It's selfish for us as preachers to just stay on our own channels. We must strive to minister to all of the channels that are before us.\\" in chapter 'Reality-Based Sermons: A Catholic Perspective' (p. 17)	2004-12-17

It deals with the history of libraries that emerged between the tenth and twentieth centuries during the period of Muslim rule, which in due course were either lost or were taken over by other libraries. The book traces the reasons for this growth of libraries and describes how Muslim rulers brought to India the art of making paper and improved binding techniques, as well as emphasis on literacy and cultural influences- all of which contributed to an improved concept of libraries and librarianship. As a result, many libraries emerged. Interestingly, mosque libraries in this era became the kind of libraries which are known today as public reading rooms. The book has the following chapters: Delhi Sultanate; Mughal Dynasty; Deccani Kingdoms; Special Libraries; Regional Libraries; and Calligraphy, Binding, Illustrations and Book Production. The book has done some justice to the topic particular library but also includes a note on how and why the collection grew and what precursors and factors motivated and supported the development process. <br />A few titles that were available in the respective libraries are listed-giving a picture of the interests which each library tried to develop and promote. <br />A few errors need correction, like Ushmania University for Osmaina University (206) and Hindu's library for libraries of non-Muslims, i.e., Hindus (144). In one case the book extends its survey to 1990 (204), whereas the Muslim rule ended <br />in 1858, and in 1947 all power of the Muslim monarchs ended; this focus by period is essential for a historical study, which may be added in a revised edition. <br />The index lacks cross references, say from ``Library of Khuda Bakhsh'' (the way it is listed), to ``Khuda Bakhsh Library'' (as a user might look it up). <br />Despite these errors, this book is yet another resource to evaluate the intellectual trends that have prevailed in this country. With its documentation and analysis of some significant collections-with descriptive notes-the book is a valuable source for those interested in textual studies and in the growth of the <br />book in India during that age, as well as for historians.	2004-12-12

While the author has made an attempt to show the existence of Trinity in four faiths (viz., Christianity's Trinity, Buddhism's Trisharana, Hinduism's Trimurti and Agless Wisdom's Triad), the respective faiths may not necessarily accept such a categorization. In Hindu theology the fact is different: 'Brahma' is the Supreme, and not otherwise. In this book we read Hinduism's Trimurti includes Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma, respectively. Whereas, Brahma is to be treated as Will or Power. So also, is the case with the Christian theological terms: The Father, The Son, and The Holy Ghost, respectively. If Holy Ghost has its original  Parakleet, in Biblical sense, it must be closer to sublime, love, etc., rather than an intelligent interpreter of the Divine action, activity and activism--Guy may have to reconsider this category, as well. Comparative religion is interesting subject in this context. Although, comparison of the God among monotheistic faiths is possible, but not across theistic groups-polytheists, monotheists, etc. Further, monotheistically speaking, 'God aspect' could then be an incorrect wording. Back to the intelligence category, if one were to take a look at what others say about the term Parakleet (in Greek or Holy Ghost in English), the author may have more food for thought. For instance, a Hindu Scholar's  citation on Islamic theology relates-on the basis of an authority, Sir William an Orientalist-the term Parakleet as refering to a real intelligent being, i.e., Prophet Mohammed. Going back to page 101, with this background, Guy's classification of Holy Spirit 'as an intelligent being' probably sounds befitting. (...).	2004-11-01

One outstanding example in this frame of reference is the Chapter three `Knowledge Management in Action: Nine Lessons Learned,' by Tom Short, IBM, and Richard C. Azzarello, Reality Consulting, Inc. (pp. 31 - 53). It is worth cataloging the nine lessons here, as an exercise in information visualization of What Works And What Doesn't:    (1) A focal point for KM improvement ensures development of an appropriate KM solution;   (2) A KM solution blueprint provides a long-lasting reference point for action;   (3) Successfully addressing a KM issue in one area of a firm often addresses it in many other areas;   (4) The best KM solutions address a business issue already perceived to be important;   (5) A passionate, committed line business leader is key to successful KM initiatives;   (6) Dedicated competent, and respected business unit members make excellent KM team members;   (7) Involve information technology and human resources from the start to expedite KM implementation;   (8) Walk a mile in their shoes;   (9) Improve knowledge worker productivity by reducing time spent on administrative or non-value-adding tasks.     Obviously, a real hard learned lesson is missing. This is true because research in KM competencies reveals: \\"Few knowledge practitioners hold credentials to assure excellence.\\"(1) In this context, one would add a tenth lesson, viz., constantly improve social capital involved in KM. This improvement is unavoidable, because of two interdependent reasons: viz., first, information has a dynamic characteristic and hence constantly grows, second (to match with this dynamism), develop the knowledge worker's ability to look beyond the horizon--with shareholders' dollar value in mind. This improvement would reduce stagnation of intellectual capital, and act as a benchmark for the return-on-investment. Budgetwise it implies a continuous investment to sustain as well maximizethe potential of human asset management. To understand these two scenarios of continuing education, as well as, the living nature of information we have an established principle. Re-phrasing Dr. Ranganathan's principle, \\"information is a growing organism\\"(2) would bring wisdom and experience to share another lesson in KM: Continuously update skills and competencies of knowledge workers to avoid redundancy.     Nevertheless, Knowledge Management Lessons Learned does teach, if one desires to learn a different way to handle content management and knowledge sharing with communities of practice.     (...)    2.

Fully illustrated, the book contains hundreds of alphabetically arranged entries, which give succinct yet authoritative information on everything from the Qur'an and its origins to the role of Islam in the USA. With even-handed coverage of the different schools of belief, and a timeline and guide to further reading, this is an indispensable and inexpensive guide to the Islamic faith (Publisher). <br /> <br />Brevity in description and presentation may be a laudable feature in a  <br />concise encyclopedia.  Elaboration is sometimes required to block  <br />distractions and ambiguities.    For instance, the book mentions Shii  <br />as a group as opposed to Sunnis. But it falls short of explaining (under the entry on Sunnis and Shi'i) what doctrines of each group are. Sunni  <br />Muslims believe that Islam is based on five pillars, namely, the profession of Faith or Iman, Salat or prayer, Saum or fasting, Zakat or alms-giving, & Hajj or pilgrimage to Mecca. In addition to these five pillars, Shii also consider Imamate (leadership of the descendants of the Holy Prophet, and their infallibility), Jihad (the holy war) and Taharah (cleanliness) as the pillars of Islam. <br /> <br />A Concise Encyclopedia of Islam draws a balance in its  <br />presentation, as it aims to offer objective coverage of all the  <br />different branches and movements within Islam, including the Sunni, Shi'i and Sufi traditions. The entries in this book explain key historical moments, pinpoint important geographical locations, define concepts from jihad to the Hajj, and outline the achievements of figures from Rumi to Malcolm X.  <br /> <br />The best part of the book which I enjoyed reading is that which avoids controversial issues.  The book does not take sides in its coverage of the existing shades of opinions. This is the greatest strength of the book, at a time when the Muslims, the followers of Islam, are more sinned against than sinning. The book strikes the balance and presents events in their true light. The balancing approach of the book makes it a useful resource. <br /> <br />Besides, the book is low priced and handy in size.  Given its utility as a handy annotated dictionary on Islam, it can be acquired by public libraries and area study institutions specializing in religious studies. <br />	2004-10-24

Just for Reading!	\\"Marijuana for dopes is a fascinating voyage through the history of humankind's use of pot, from warrior women and trembling kings in ancient Indochina to auto mechanics and outlaw accountants at backyard barbecues in outer Des Moines. In the United States alone, over 60 million people have smoked marijuana at least once in the last five years\\" (back cover) <br /> <br />The 138 pages book intensively and extensively orients a knowledge seeker on the grass that is actively grown ubiquitously, and the smoke that is passively inhaled by humankind, and made a global impression in history irrespective of time and tide. Exceptionally, a leading history maker of 20th century America, Bill Clinton, is reportedly `the only person who didn't inhale'. Bill admits having used marijuana, \\"He tried it, didn't like it, and didn't inhale, or so he said\\" (p. 65).  <br /> <br />The table of contents present a clear picture of the book: What is this stuff, anyway; Getting high is ancient history; Pot in Europe and the West; Cannabis in the New World: Marijuana; The studies; The hemp business (It's not what you think); A pharmacological cornucopia; Cannabis in religion; Cannabis culture in the 21st century; Notes; A glossary for dopes; Sources; Index. <br /> <br />This book is an easy to read, simple to trace, fun to understand, historic in approach, religious in its transcendental wings, factual in its narrative, and pun oriented. The anecdotes and exhaustive quotes that abound are worth the salt of the smoke, even if you are not a dope and even you were never an addict of this Grass, that is green, and which made history in being smuggled in some quarters, religiously consumed in some, and politicized in others.  <br /> <br />Popular culture is its focus. Popular dupe are its characters. The whole book is a very precise cultural survey of its existence in east and west. A work of a librarian - not the librarian who simply catalogs book titles, but who is intensely analytical too, Joseph Romain's twentieth published book, is characterized by authoritative citations. \\"This is a book for all the glaziers and dopers and singers and tax lawyers and mechanics and nurses and librarians and vice presidents and shipping clerks and teachers and accordion players, professors of Early American Literature, and grave diggers with whom I have shared a smoke. This is a book for the butcher, the baker, and the candlestick maker - even if they don't inhale\\" (preface). <br /> <br />It is a good reading not only for popular culture students and specialists, but also by any one who is interested in understanding the age old history of global grass eating cultural cousins across the seven seas, and commonly consume cannabis - though with different names - bhang, ganja, charas, opium, hashish, majoon, marijuana, kif, grass, hemp, pot, sinsemilla, etc. After all, what's in a name! <br /> <br />Since the book leaves the grass growing, a sequel to this book can provide further diversified food for thought to the Cannabis and other cousins of dope in, for instance, the mystical dimensions. Those interested in dumping Cannabis literature to the recycle bin will think twice as the extent of this subject and the scatter of the resources. The book, under review, is just a tip of the iceberg. On mystical dimensions of the drug and its associates, there may be thousands of resources. There is a direct reference to cannabis in classical medieval Persian literature.	2004-10-24

And secondly, it lays down the path for those who wish to informally improve their skills and manage even a dynamic Website. I would strongly recommend this book to all those who are interested in expanding their Web-based technological initiatives. Some insights in this book are of value even to those who have crossed the accidental stage. Hence, I would recommend this book even for managers and administrators of Web sites.	2004-10-24

It, also, facilitates furthering knowledge management studies in relation to return on investment in a corporate culture. To achieve this end a direct route is prescribed in this book. It has to be based on the integration of organizational knowledge, i.e. using Choo's favorite trio: tacit knowledge, explicit knowledge and cultural knowledge.	2004-10-24

In late 1990s emerged client-server technology and dynamic web sites, which enabled creating a new trend, that is, Web-accessible databases. With this level of extensive advancement, today's Web architecture can easily facilitate both online and onsite access.  <br /> <br />Database-Driven Web Sites is a useful resource and empowers \\"librarians to create new services that would be impossible with strictly HTML-based web sites, so along with advice from professionals, Database-Driven Web Sites offers you practical tips for managing complex projects and includes numerous links to online resources and software\\". This documentation strategy in developing an innovative interface is the strongest link of the book. Librarians and information professionals looking for hands-on experience directly from on-site project managers will get in this book a lot of useful information. <br /> <br />Hence, I strongly recommend this as a handy reference book on library's infostructure. It is also useful for developmental perspectives in Web-based architecture, database design and information infrastructure <br />	2004-10-24

Such a futuristic dimension is best reflected in the last chapter, i.e., Giving up Prophecy. Billings has summarized, in this collection, his extensive experiences, and presented a summum bonum of his 25 years career - from grassroots to the bureaucratic heights, building infostructures that sustain any hurricane. Herein, intangibles are so nicely presented that even a novice in the field does not have to re-read the text or find much left for imagination. His thought provoking essays challenge information professionals to accept needed change. He is of the view that those who forget history will be forced to repeat it.  <br /> <br />Given the strength of the book as a good assessment of successful ventures in information-sharing I recommend it to practitioners in academic / research libraries, as well as, library schools. <br />	2004-10-24

Yahiya Emerick's book entitled `The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Islam' successfully meets this need.  It is a very useful reference book on Islam as religion and Muslims as its followers. <br /> <br />This book is a good guide for those who know little about Islam but who want to understand it sincerely.  It describes in a matter-of-fact way what this religion is all about and what it is not about. As a useful reference source, I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning the truth about Islam. In conclusion, I find it appropriate to quote Tennyson: `Let knowledge grow from more to more; and more of reverence in us dwell.'	2004-10-24

This question has bothered many since a century.    Noble Laureate Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) moved the classes outside, under the tree. The school called Shantiniketan, the abode of peace, was initially an Ashram or hermitage founded in 1863 by his father, Maharishi Devendranath Tagore. The criticism as well as the opposition, that emerged on this extended form of learning was unimaginable. Being an open-air school started in 1901 today it is successfully functioning as an international open university and named as Vishva-Bharati. Based on a similar concept, emerged the distance learning programs which are spread all over. This distance learning created a model for informal education. With Internet came the next generation of training, using Web technology for facilitating in the beginning by email based asynchronous, and now by synchronous interactive programs. Today Web-based training (WBT) is just doing what Tagore did by further moving the education from the school building.    This book is divided into three sections, viz., Section I Web-based training: Introduction (pp. 1-74) with 7 chapters; Section II Web-based training: Design and Development Perspectives (pp. 75-366) with 32 chapters, and Section III Web-based Training: Implementation and Evaluation Perspectives (pp. 367-5558) with 24 chapters. It also has an Author index (pp. 559-568), and Subject index (pp. 569-599).     For those who are looking for additional resources that incorporate Web-based perspectives, the book has a chapter on digital libraries (pp. 391-394), by John Schmitz, and an exhaustive directory, `Web-based Training Resources' (pp. 59-74), by Manal el- Tigi and Badrul Khan. The directory provides links to print, institutional and Websites. This vast information is systematically categorized under 16 types of resources, such as databases; magazines; books; online bookstores; conferences; FAQS (online courses); Jobs; WBT/WBI courses; Companies; Software; etc..    This compendium provides real insights to all those wish to develop new platforms or evaluate the existing modules.  It helps in understanding the attitudes, strategies, and techniques for the virtual classroom. It also has a focus both on academic research and acts as a solid practitioner's guide to the literature. It is a must for all those who are interested in understanding the lessons of history and would like to avoid the mistakes of the pretesters. Everyone interested in end-user computing will benefit with the innovative guidelines to adapt technology on the information highway.  (...)	2004-10-23

Sibai's book is not just a history of libraries attached to Mosques, it presents the  historical overview of how the first library (housed in mosque) evolved  into reading room, study centre, open and free public library, all under a  single roof. Such libraries attached to Mosques have existed all thro' the  1400 years of Islamic civilization. Sibai's work also dwells into some  minor details, such as, naming of the Mosque library, intellectual  contents, shelf arrangement and organizational details. This book is also  translated into Persian (Tarikh-i kitabkhanahha-yi masajid/Muhammad  Makki Siba`i ; tarjamah-'i Muhammad `Abbaspur, Muhammad Javad  Mahdavi.Published:     Mashhad : Mu'assasah-i Chap va  Intisharat-iAstan-i Quds-i Razavi, 1373 [1994]  LC Call No.: IN  PROCESS).	2000-03-28
