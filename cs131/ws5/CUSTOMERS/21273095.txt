This one though has fallen a little short. For one this book is very, very similer to Midnight. Just not as good. The similarities really are stunning.  That alone made me give this book only 3 stars. I mean I already read this in another book.  Very disappointing . What seemed like a new fresh idea in book one, has become an extended remake of the classic Midnight.  If your a fan of horror and have not read midnight then you will still very much enjoy this book though.	2005-08-26

Well I have to disagree. His last three books have been very good. When I read the preview for this book I was very excited about it. It sounded like it had the potential to be a very good book. So I pre-ordered it and waited. When I recieved it I read it in two days and what A book. This is his best of the last several and they were good.  <br /> <br />It's very fast paced, the characters are good, has many twists and the suspence is excellent.  If you like Koontz or you simply like suspence novels go out get this book and enjoy a great story.	2005-07-31

The characters are interesting, the interaction between them is great. The detail, all there without slowing the story down. I was very pleased with the story all the way up till the end. It was like she was rushed all at once. I mean you get this well written, well told story, one that keeps you on the edge of your seat through a couple hundred pages. Then all at once it's over.<br /><br />Well if your a mystery nut you really should read this book. Just go in with an open mind and realize that the ending is going to a little quicker than you expected	2005-07-10

It never got boring and grabbed you from page one. One of the best things about this story was the characters. You really learned to like and care for them. You also really got a sense of family and caring for one another. There was also a fair amount of humor as well.  <br /> <br />I guess if I had to Catagorize this book I would label it a mystery/thriller. But one thing is for sure, if you pick it up, you are in for a fun entertaining ride. Be prepare for some twists. <br />	2005-05-17

With the other two books I know what I wanted to get out of them but they just came up short.  ROTS on the other hand completely satisfies in everyway.  <br /> <br />This book really seems to dive into the close relationship between Anakin and Obi-Wan. Which is great because you get to see how truly close they are and just how deep the betrayel is. I would say they are the main characters of the book.  Padme Amidala is also in it of course but her role is bit smaller than in the other stories. An Chancellor Palpatine is in the spot light quite often. Then finally Mace and yoda, they both have thier fare share of spot light.  Mace actually has what I consider the best lightsaber fight of the book, thought Anakins and Obi-Wans is quite amazing. <br /> <br />This story is also high speed action from begining to end. It rarely slows down and when it does, it's not for very long! The first 130 pages is one big airial and lightsaber fight! <br /> <br />Well if you love Star Wars, and you don't mind them being dark, this is the best there is. and believe me all of your questions will be answered in this one!	2005-05-10

It's one that you never truly know whats going on. You may think you do but you really don't.  At one point I thought I knew and I was close or partially right.  Then when it was done I realized that is was so much larger than I had thought. If you like books that throws you curves all the time; ones that you never really on what's going on; ones that at the ending you have to laugh and go wow, I didn't quite see that comming than go get this book and enjoy.	2005-05-05

Time travel has never been my cup of tea. I'm just not a SiFi nut. But how I was so very wrong. This is one of the most unique and fasinating stories I have ever read. An there was not one page where I got bored. Even when the action wasn't their I found myself immersed in the characters. <br /> <br />So lets start with the characters. Laura Shane, one of the more interesting characters I have been introduced to. You really feel for her and live through her eyes. Next we'll go to Stefan. You tend not to get as involved emotionally with him, but that is to be expected. I mean he is the mysterious stranger, Laura's guardian angle, so you don't get as much interaction with him. Then you also have Laura's best friends Thelma and her twin sister. They are also good rich characters. <br /> <br />Finally we come to the story and what a story! Charater development and interaction are some of the very best I have seen. The story also throws you for a lop once or twice. And it also gives you a very, unique take on time travel. Like I said time travel stories are not really my cup of tea, but this is so much more. So much deeper than that. I would not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone.	2005-04-22

It has moments of greatness and moments that are not all that great. In most of Dean's books I fall right into the story and the lives of the characters. This just did not happen here. Though the story was good and the characters as well, there just seemed to be something missing. For one I think part of the problem was that there was not enough back story. That might explain why it was so hard to get into the characters. I will say this, even though the bulk of the book was  just average, the ending was great. If the rest of the book had been that good I would have given 4 stars.	2005-04-09

What I'm saying is the things that the scientist did is not at all unbelievable. Someone who wants to devote his life to a mind control project is obviously power hungry. Then you add to that his terrible past and I would be quite suprised to see him act in any other way then the way he did.     For this reason I give as much as three stars. Because Koontz was truthful and did not shy away from reality even though it would be grotesque.  Know the reason I only gave three and not more is the simple fact that mind control just doen't interest me that much. But if your into that sort of thing or simply want a thriller to read then this book could be just the right book for you.	2005-02-13

At first I did not think I was going to be able to get into it. Not that it was low to start, on the contrary it started with a bang. Just for one reason or another I didn't feel it. Well as the story went on the story continued to get better and I ended up really liking it. There was just something there that I can't explain that kept me from rating the book as great. <br /> <br />The charcters are  very good. The only one I didn't greatly care for was Mrs. Dakoda. Dean seemed to be trying to make her a little to tough. This is a very, very small flaw though and another reader my not feel that way at all. The villians were very Unique and well thought out. I have never encountered anything quite like them anywhere else.  <br /> <br />If you like Koontz and are a fan of this type of story, then I would recommend this book, but there are better Koontz books out there. <br />	2005-02-07

The story is also keep short and this also was the right thing to do. I mean you can only go so long with a story about the only human left on the planet. Be forewarned this is without a doubt the darkest story I have ever read. This is not bad, on the contrary it really gives the story an atheneic feel. You really feel like you are there, like your looking through his eyes. Wow, how depressing and frightning.<br /><br />If you like horror and want to read something completely original in every aspect then by all means find a copy and enjoy the ride.	2005-02-06

The story, as usual with a Koontz book, unfolds at  break neck speed. I mean it never lows down, right up to the very last page! Be forwarned, there is nothing that even comes close to closure in this book. Its as if they wrote the entire story and picked the most suspenceful parts and end the book there. Then smiling , they watch as we anxiously wait for next volume to come. <br /> <br />If you like Koontz, horror or SiFi please go out and get this book. But take one word of advice, you may want to wait till we are a little closer to the release date for the second book. I'm in anguish knowing I have to wait four months!	2005-02-03

Even though the book is not about him and he is only a supporting character, he still manages to play a major role.  <br /> <br />Now with that cleared up lets move on to the characters. Gram first. He is my favorite agent out of all three Hannibal related books.  Next well deal with killer. He was great. I just found him so interesting. I mean there is nothing ground breaking here but the author just makes you hungery to know whats going on in his head. All of the supporting staff are very competent and do not bog the story down. <br /> <br />The story is very, very solid and told exceptionally well. It is also an easy read and should not take all that long to finish. Now out of the three books I would probably have to say that this is my favorite.  Not by much. Only by a very very small margin.  There is just something special about it. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-02-01

First lets start with Whispers. In my opinion one of the best books very written. Great characters, great story, told very, very well. Great suspence/drama/Mystery. <br /> <br />Next lets go to Watchers. Another great book. Not as good as Whispers but very good. Good characters, good story and well told. Only down side is it a little preachy at times. Great suspence/Horror/SiFi. <br /> <br />Then lastly, Shattered. This story is a bit different. It is really just a short story, around 100 pages or so. The story is not really all that original either. A maniac following two people across country. On the upside is is still a good story, is well told, fun to read and does not take long to finish.	2005-01-13

This is a true horror story, plain and simple! The characters were great. Even the ones you did not like played great roles in the story. The ancient Evil was great to.  Some feel the book draged on a bit to long, peronally I feel it could have been a bit longer. Dean does a great job giving the book a truly eerie feeling. This is my second favorite book by Koontz, second only to Whispers.	2005-01-13

For starters it has one of the best villians I've ever read about.  Not only is he truly insane and sadistic but by the end you realize he is also a victim.  You actually feel sorry for him. <br /> <br />The other characters are very good also. All of them.  Now that is rare, not to find one character in a book you do not like. <br /> <br />Next is the story.  It is simply just flat out a great story.  Well told and well written.  Add the top notch group of characters and you get one hell of a book. <br /> <br />This is my third Koontz book and it is by far the best so far.  Not that the others were bad, Shattered and Watchers, on the contrary they were very good also but not on par with this great novel.  Quite simply this is a must read, PERIOD!	2004-09-04

The retriever, alex and his girlfriend are good but take second place to the above Mentioned. <br /> <br />The only thing I didn't like about this book was it was a bit to preachy.

With that said it is still a pretty good trilogy. One of the first things you will notice are the dramatic changes in the wold we have all come to love. The first being no Magic! I really thought this would ruin the book but it didn't. It just add a few new interesting twists. Next is the absence of the gods. Once again not a big deal just different. Where The War of Souls seems to really fall behind The War of The Lance is with its Characters.  They just don't really jump off the page at you like WOTL characters did. And when it was all said and done you just don't feel like you have a whole lot invested in them emotionally.      Now don't get me wrong, War of Souls is definitly a trilogy that will entertain and will make you glad you read it. Just don't go in thinking your going to read another War of The Lance.	2004-07-11

I must admit that I liked the Dark Elf Trilogy better than Icewind Dale, which I thought was great. It's not only an in depth look into one of the greatest fantasy characters of all time but also of one of the most unexplored and interesting races. The dark atmosphere really helped add additional character to the story. The supporting characters were very strong as well. This actually surprised me.  I figured it would be hard to develop interesting characters in a land were every ones only reason for living was advancement. Even at the cost of a brother's, sister's or even mother's life. I was so very wrong. There are many interesting characters. Ones that will show there faces in many other books.

I cared more for this group of Characters then any others I have ever read about. I truly consider them friends.      Next are the Villains. They are really well fleshed out. They all have a purpose other then to help fill pages and they intertwine with the characters Intimately. Then you add a very , very well written story that has been well thought out and you get one hell of a good trilogy.     Don't get me wrong, there are many other great trilogies out there; Dark elf, Icewindale,Lord of the Rings, Sword of Shannara but Chronicles is #1 period! There simply is no other set of books that when I pick them up and begin chapter one, make think out loud, \\"it's good to be home.\\"	2004-07-11

It has great characters, great Villains and is truly Suspenseful. The beginning, the fist 80 pages or so, it is a bit dry. But once you get past that the remaining 300 or so pages are truly nail bitters.  If you like horror this book is an absolute must read.	2004-07-01
