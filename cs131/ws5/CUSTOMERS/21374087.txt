The book has good information but not everything you want to know about Oracle. Frankly, the books helps but it is not complete reference. It would not be a bad idea at all to own a copy of it.<br /><br />I give 4 stars.	2005-08-02

For someone who is already familiar to PL/SQL, you can save money by going through the Oracle Online Manual to read about the new features of PL/SQL in Oracle 9i. Since I already had a previous version (Oracle 8) of this book, I consider buying this book as waste of money. But if you are just getting into the world of oracle and you want to learn PL/SQL, this book is for you. One nice thing about the book is it comes with a CD that has some trial version of some development environments. Nice to explore those.<br />I give 4 stars.	2005-08-02

The ER diagram and Normalization are covered and other topics such data warehouse were also touched. Overall it is worth to read and I would recommend it.	2005-06-20

I believe the book can help junior DBAs get prepared for a job interview.<br />For the reviewers who think the book can help hire the wrong person, I would say that is true. But if you are not a qualified DBA and you study this book to get a job, sooner or later your lies will catch up with you and you will be on the road again looking for another job.	2005-05-29

I ordered this book and it helps me refresh a lot about Unix and shell scripting leanrt in school many years ago as undergraduate student. The book is well-written and will keep you excited.

The author did a pretty good job in writing this book. I believe since the book was published Oracle Corporation updated the exam objectives which makes the book not very useful for the exam. The reason I gave 4 stars to the book is it is not the author's fault if the exam objectives were updated. But the author did cover a lot of grounds even though it is not complete. He managed to explain in a few pages the huge exam objectives. He wrote his book according the to published exam objectives avalaible at that time. That is my sense. Just so you know topics like report was not covered in the book. The First part of the book is almost complete but the second is not even closed. Some areas are not covered at all in the book. So just be aware of that.<br />Having read the book and completed the exercises in the book I thought I was ready. I tried to play with some STS and Transcender demos software on the subject and that is when I become aware that I needed other materials to study for the exams. I supplemented my study with other books and training courses in pdf. I completed my exams with a score (1z0-131 55/60) and (1z0-132 57/60).<br />Overall the book is well-written. It can be used as a starting point but you would need other materials to supplement your study before taking the exams. I don't regret buying this book. I like it and I am planning to keep it around.<br /><br />Good Luck...	2005-04-12

I would not rate myself as beginner because I have dealt with MS SQL Server on many occasions but not heavily. I am pacing myself with one chapter a day. So far I read about 5 chapters and I would admit that the content is good. Like any other technical book, this one also has some mistakes. In my case I started seeing the mistake on pages 145 and 146. On those pages the authors stated that to see the file id you need to run in the SQL Analyzer the stored procedure sp_helpdb. That is not true at all it should be sp_helpfile. I caught that mistake quickly because I really understood the previous information given and related to file, and I also tested the stored procedures listed in the book. I did check the errata on sybex website nothing is listed concerning that mistake but there are some other corrected mistakes though on the website.<br /><br />As I always do I don't rely on one source for my certification exams. I have got another book and I am planning to get a third one too. I will go through all of them before I go take the exam end of May. I will try to post another review after I took exam.<br /><br />My overall impression on this book is the book is well-written and easy to follow. So far I am getting useful information out of the book. And that helps me understand the objectives on the exam. I am doing pretty good with the review questions at the end of the chapters. After going through half of the book I think I like what I see and I would recommend this book but not as the only source to study for the exam.	2005-04-02

I used this book in Spring 2004 as class textbook while taking my graduate courses and I also had the privilege to have the author as the person who taught the class.

It is a good study guide. I have not had difficulty going through the book since I was exposed to the pl/sql language when I was studying for the exam (1z0-001, Introduction to oracle 8i sql and pl/sql). This was a huge benefit for me and I only spent about three weeks reading the book. I will say that this exam (1z0-101) is built on the first one (1z0-001). I am not sure if it is also built on the exam (1z0-007). You will need to know the basics of pl/sql to fully understand this book.<br /><br />The author did a pretty job breaking down all the information you need for the exam. There was no questions on Chapter 8 and Chapter 9 was barely touched with one question on debugging.<br /><br />I will advice you to read carefully the book and make sure you master the concept before you go take the exam. If you do it the exam comes easy for you. You will be shown a lot of codes during the exam. My strategy was this: in order to avoid wasting time reading the entire code, I read the question first. That allows to me spot quickly the objective and see quickly what is being asked without reading the long code. Stuff you need to be carefull of:<br />-Parameter declaration in Function and Procedure header<br />-Function without a Return<br />-Public and Private Constructs behavior<br />-Triggers behavior<br />-Function and Procedure call<br />This strategy allowed to complete my exam in less than one hour. Good Luck.	2005-02-20

At that time I needed more information about Backup and Recovery and especially Recovery Manager (RMAN)and I ended up borrowing this book from the library. I then put my exam study guide aside and finish this book. The book is really good. The part that I like the most is the book gives you scenarios that are easy to understand and it shows RMAN in different environment interacting with other storage media. I will definitely recommend this book. A book like this one does not come along very often. I am planning to buy my own copy soon. Great Job RG I give 4 stars.<br /><br />Update: November 5, 2006<br />This the best book on oracle B & R. Since I had my own copy I really enjoy the book especially the RMAN workshop.

Nothing really exciting about it. The book is just an overview of the New Features of Oracle 10g. It has certainly some useful information that you can also find in the Oracle Online Documentation. It is well-written and easy to follow. I have nothing against the book but I prefer using the Oracle Online Documentation that is more complete and accurate most of the time. I am glad I don't own a copy of this book otherwise it would have been a waste of money. The copy that I read was from the library.

This study guide is very detailed, and informative. I used this book along with the Oracle Press Book and the OOD (Oracle Online Documentation). This book covers all the objectives on the exam in a clear way. I was well-prepared for the exam. I went through this book at least 3 times. I took my time to prepare for the exam. The screenshots in the book were good. I had a few question on them. The OOD was also helpful. I used it constantly if I wanted to double check something said in the book. I strongly believe if you use this book alone you can pass the exam. There was not a question on the exam that this book has not discussed. I give a lot credit to the authors for the book. They did a good job writing this study guide.<br /><br />My advice for you on the exam: make sure you understand the concept of ASM, Indexes with Partitions, Advisory Framework chapter, Materialized Views, Security Policies, and Datapump architecture. I was heavily tested on those areas.<br /><br />The practice exam questions in the Sybex study guide and the Oracle Press Book were very helpful.

I previoulsy reviewed this book back in December 2004 (see below my previous opinion on the book). The book is good for the certification exam and has some relevant information you need to know for the exam. I was just disappointed about the amount of errors in the book. If you notice those errors you are fine.<br /><br />I took my exam today (Tuesday January 25, 2005) and score 51/61. The reason I came back to update my review is to give some credit to this book. I would admit that I learnt from this book. But I did not rely on this book alone. I also used the Sybex study guide and the OOD (Oracle Online Documentation). All of three provided me a valuable assistance in studying for the exams. The practice exam questions in the Oracle Press Book and the Sybex Study guide were helpful and I did not have to buy a practice exam software.<br /><br />My advice for the exam: make sure you understand clearly the following concepts: ASM, Datapump architecture, Materialized Views, Security Policy,Index with partitions, and Advisory Framework. I was heavily tested in those areas.<br /><br />December 24, 2004 (review)<br />I agree with most of reviewers about the amount of errors in the books. Only people who read without paying attention to the contents and not following the logic will have a hard time finding those errors. I bought this book because of the author reputation since I read one of his books before. I would say that Sam Alapati is an expert in Database area, not doubt about it. But the book was written in a hasty approach with the goal to grab the market share before the competitors. I strongly believe the book is still useful. Beside the typos and some misleading errors, the book has very important information you need to know for the exam. It just gives you a lot of work to double check every thing.<br /><br />I will admit that I was surprised by the first two reviews written back in November 2004. At that time I already went through about 3 chapters of the oracle press book and started seeing those mistakes in the book. I was struck by the fact that they were praising the book without mentionning those mistakes in the book.<br /><br />As I always do, I don't use one source to prepare for the exam. I bought both oracle press books and sybex study guide at the same time. I have to switch to the sybex book due to those frustating mistakes you have to check all the time. So far I feel pretty comfortable with the sybex study guide. I already went through the entire sybex book and going through it for the second time.<br />I am planning to go back to the oracle press book too before I go take the exam. The exam questions in the oracle press are OK but not the best.<br /><br />I don't know if I will recommend this book to anyone but it is just matter of choice. I don't regret buying it and I am planning to keep it around.<br /><br />I give 3 stars.<br />Good luck!!!those mistakes in the book.

The practice exams on the CD were very helpfull especially those questions related to recovery scenarios. I would recommend this book to candidates taking the OCP. But my advice would be to use the oracle online documentation to clear some doubts you might have or get more  information. Very often, the oracle online documentation provides you the best expalanation. This exam is really challenging with a lot things to know. You will probably have different recovery scenarios questions.I will also advise you to spend time on the Oracle Networking part to master the concepts correctly before taking the exam.<br /><br />I will finish by thanking Rama Velpuri for the great job he did putting this Exam Guide together.

The book walks you through some pratices that build over time a complete understanding of the topic on the exam. But I did not rely mainly on this book for the exam 1z0-031. Since the book does not have a lot of practice exam questions I had to use other references such as the Sybex book by (Chip Dawes and Biju Thomas) and the oracle press book by (J. Couchman and Sudheer Marisetti). Those are good books too. But they tend to focus more on the idea of &quot;what you need to know to get certified&quot;. The Sybex book is pretty good with Chapters well-structured and explained. The Oracle press book provides more practice exam questions that I used to test my knowledge of the topic.<br />I will definitely recommend this book to ocp candidates. I give 5 stars.

I believe using this book alone you will not pass the test. Unless you have been working on oracle for a while. I used this book as supplement of the Sybex study guide. The practice exam questions were helpful. I passed my exam (1z0-001) on March 29, 2004 relying on the Sybex Study Guide. I would not recommend this book to someone new to oracle but I can recommend that as second reference.<br />I give 3 stars.	2004-06-11
