Michael Moore is a big fat stupid white man. Michael Moore is a big fat stupid white man.  Go out on the street and do it. Then buy this book.  <br /> <br />If you think Michael Moore is a Big Fat Stupid White Man you should buy this book. If you hate moderates and liberals and you know in your heart that Bush is God, or damned close to it, then buy this book. You need it. Or if you just think Moore is a nasty looking guy, buy this book. If you know that Fahrenheit 9/11 is a piece of crap even though you haven't seen it, you really need this book. And, if you have seen it and you're a wing nut, you really need this book to bail you out. It will help you with the talking points you need to berate millions and millions of miserable Bush-haters who pretend to love their country. <br /> <br />Moore is your enemy. You've tried to keep his films from being shown anywhere. You wanted Moore arrested for treason. You filed complaints with the FEC to stop advertising for F911. You threatened film distributors. You convinced Michael Eisner that Disney should not distribute this film after he spent $6 million  of stockholder funds to make it.  <br /> <br />And despite all of that, it's the biggest film put out by a Disney company in more than a year. (Except that Disney stockholders don't get any of the loot). More than 20 million Americans have seen it. It's a box office smash and Moore, who was already well off, is set for life. Millions of people around the world who have come to despise us because of George Bush's arrogance have seen it ... and the unedited portions, sans Moore, including \\"My Pet Goat.\\"  It's just terrible that the White House wasn't asked to edit the film. <br /> <br />No one should be allowed to show film that does not make the fascist-in-chief look heroic. Bush is an American Caesar, a Louis XV, a Hit .. no, no, no. Let's don't go thee. <br /> <br />Moore has failed to show the brilliance of the Neo-Con intellectuals (AKA the strutting chickenhawk boys and girl) in Washington who promised and gave us the cakewalk in Iraq, who freed an ungrateful people. This is a president supported by wonderful people who struggle every day to tell us what's good about our great new war -- pushing aside those horribly negative people who dwell on how it's draining the national treasury, killing hundreds of trooops and thousands of Iraqis and leaving thousands of Americans without limbs. Everything has a price and if we're not safer, at least we can go out with a bang. So buy this book and get mad at Moore. It's his fault that too many people are dwelling on what's gone wrong in Iraq, a war that had to be fought for some reason or the other.  <br /> <br />Moore should be ashamed of showing Paul Wolfowitz licking his comb. It was terrible propaganda. Oh, wait a minute. Propaganda is something that Fascist do when they're running the country and Moore doesn't work for anyone. And he voted for Nader. Bad Moore. You should demand that Bush take your advice and order Moore deported. Next thing you know, he'll be eating creme brulee in Montparnasse with Neil Bush and his newest strumpet. And by golly, we won't be thinking about those miserable whiny troops who think that three tours in Iraq is a bit much for a weekend warrior and that this stop loss thing is just another form of the draft. Right, buy this book. Getting mad at Moore will fix you right up.  <br /> <br />Buy this book. It tells you just how bad Moore is without ever having to watch one of his films. You don't have to think.  Actually, you don't even have to read it. Buying this book is a vote for putting Michael Moore in his place. Buy this book and you won't even think about why our draftdodging, AWOLer-in-Chief is orchestrating yet another smear campaign against another Vietnam veteran. Buy this book and you won't have to think about anything. You can just repeat it by rote. And it accomplishes two noble goals. <br /> <br />Thefirst is providing free publicity for Michael Moore who delighted that they managed to spell his name right. He would appreciate you doing the same. The second goal is to put some much needed money in the hands of these authors. Besides it provides work for the people who print it and sell it, at least those who haven't been outsourced yet. The Authors' next book has already been outsourced to a computer which will assemble requisite phrases to get you mad and give you ammunition when you don't have any of your own. <br /> <br />Frankly, I read it standing up at the bookstore because by not buying books, I have more money to invest for my retirement. But that's me. If you call yourself a conservative and you're mad about those darned liberals and Michael Moore, buy this book. <br /> <br />The only thing I object to about this book is one word in the title. Michael Moore is certainly big, fat, white and male, but he's not stupid. At least not stupid stupid. He got Disney to pony up $6 million to make Fahrenheit 9/11 and Eisener wouldn't distribute it. Considering that it's already grossed nearly $120 million just in the US and another $50 million overseas (and the run isn't finished) without even considering DVD sales this fall. I would have to say that Eisner was the stupid white man and Moore took unfair advantage.  <br /> <br />But buy this book. PUt your money where your mouth is. And the next time someone asks you if you've seen Fahrenheit 9/11, you can tell them you've read this book and your mind is made up.  <br /> <br />You owe us that much. You don't have any business buying books that disagree with our government. Buy this book. Or else we'll know which side you're on. It's one of the reasons we're in Iraq. To make sure they see things that way ... and we'll shut down any newspaper or broadcaster that quibbles. So buy this book.	2004-08-22

With filth, lies, dishonor and the money and lies of rich allies. This time, George W. Bush hopes to benefit from the kind of sliming he gave earlier to John McCain, another bona fide hero who sometimes lets his good graces overwhelm him to point of being polite to the Texas Dirtball. <br /> <br />Back in the 60s, before the current Chickenhawk BUSH War,  the son of a rich, powerful and politically connected man could vault ahead of others into the TANG. Didn't even have to show up too often.  Plenty of time for lots of Coca Cola and  party til you drop. If you didn't show up -- well, no big. That just meant you didn't have to worry about anyone remembering anything about whatever you didn't do while you were draft dodging with the other rich kids of the time. <br /> <br />You could have your cake and eat it too. You could support the war in Vietnam and make damned sure someone else's kid died -- because you could hide in the Guard in those days. Some of the people involved in this book may have served honorably in Vietnam, but now they've dishonored themselves and every other Vietnam veteran. A fair number of REMFs in this bunch, and they're here.   <br /> <br />It's too bad today's Guardsmen can't get away with what Bush did, but it's no longer a place for draft-dogers like Bush. And doubtless if some veteran  of the current Chickenhawk war decides to run for office and doesn't neatly fit the Bush dynasty's plans,  the Bush smear campaign will go after that person just as it has John McCain, John Kerry, and others.  <br /> <br />If, of course, it was your turn to be selected preznit Bush, you could always get some of your Texas buddies to lie for you. They'd burn any embarrassing records if necessary and theyso they have. Promises to the contrary. We've never seen Mr. Bush's OFFICIAL full service record. What we see are selective and carefully edited PR releases. Where is the dayto day drumbeat of Bush cowardice. Where is the endless wailing on right wing radio and television about Bush's avoiding service and his faked, phoney and destroyed records. <br /> <br />Now the Bushes operatives churn out this bucket of lies. There's enough dishonorable nonsense here to last a lifeime. Mr O'Neill never amounted to much except he developed a lifelong habit of lying. Admiral Hoffman had a taste for body counts -- and got his Silver Star for flying over a batle -- after it was over.  <br /> <br />But it is Lt. Commander George Eliott who comes in for the National Medal of Dishonor. His pit is foul. His story changes with the season and the needs of a Bush smear campaign. A once honorable officer forgets the oath he took as a Navy officer, an oath that required him to exercise constant diligence. Now Commander Elliott says almost everything he signed off on was a lie. And that what he has heard subsequently from people who didn't serve with Kerry is what counts. <br /> <br />SO ELLIOTT SWEARS --GIVING TWO AFFIDAVITS - THAT HE WAS DERELICT IN HIS DUTY, DISHONEST IN EVERY ASPECT, LIED ABOUT CLOSELY OBSERVING OFFICERS. HIS NAME ON NUMEROUS DOCUMENTS ATTEST TO KERRY'S HEROISM. HIS SIGNATURE IS ON AWARDS FOR OTHER OFFICERS. NOW HE SAYS HE LIED AND SUBMITTED DOCUMENTS THAT HE NOW CLAIMS WERE FALSE. <br /> <br />Mr. Elliott attested he had closely observed Mr. Kerry's performance and rated him highly \\"based on personal observation\\" as is required. Now he says he didn't do what he was supposed to do and some people have convinced him he didn't know his duty 25 years ago. Bow wow. <br /> <br />This crew of McHale's Navy Republicans with two not funny lies for every pot are simply an arm of the Bush Smear Campaign for re-election. They sought out veterans in some cases, then asked them to sign carefully edited rewrites of their statemetns so they would support their premise. Anyone who wasn't interested in joing up with a political smear were disinvited. There are a lot of Vietnam vets, most of them honorable decent men. They're not represented in this disgusting book.  <br /> <br />Today, for example, former Lt jg William Rood, after trying to stay out of this, affirmed Mr. Kerry's actions on the day he won the Silver Star.  Mr. Kerry commanded one swift boat, Mr. Rood another and Lt. jg Don Droz  who was KIA a few weeks later the third.  <br /> <br />Mr. Rood says these critics, i.e. the authors of the slimy volume,  are using stories that he knows to be untrue.  He was there. They weren't. It doesn't get any simpler. He doesn't want to be involved in the Kerry campaign.  He's not giving interviews. But forget John O'Neill's lie about the teenager in a loin cloth. O'Neill wasn't there. He lied about that, just as he's lied about everything else. Mr. Rood knows what happened and it doesn't agree with what this book claims. O'Neill gives every veteran a bad name.  <br /> <br />It is impossible for launch a smear campaign such as this book does without sliming the innocent. Mr. Rood and Mr. Droz' family are also being smeared by these people. Mr. Rood says it's harder and harder for those who were actually there to watch this accumulating pile of lies from these warriors of sleeze.  <br /> <br />Should we dwell on Preznit Bush's AWOL and disgraceful behavior in the ANG.  <br /> <br />Actually no. Kerry served and went to Vietnam. Bush didn't. But what we ought to focus on is how to get rid of the kind of politics exemplified by this book. And we ought to start by replacing the Draft-Dodger in Chief so someone can start cleaning up the mess he has created along with all of his other Chickhawk warriors of Ideology. It's the future that counts. Not these liars. People like them are one reason Iraq is such an awful mess. <br /> <br />Why do I say Kerry should have joined the Texas Air Guard. Because he would have shown up for duty instead of snorting and drinking. And he wouldn't have to be dealing with this particular  set ofBush smear artists. The Texas old boy Republican party boys take care of each other. Too bad about today's Guard. <br /> <br />Coauthor Corsi, it should be noted, has established himself as a homophobic. anti-Catholic, anti-semite racist, having been forced to apologize   for \\"describing Muslims and Catholics as pedophiles and Pope John Paul II as senile.\\" He also suggested Islam was fine \\"just as long as the women are beaten, the boys buggered and the infidels are killed.\\" Ad Naseum from this seriously sick whacko.  <br /> <br />That's the kind of scum involved with this book. Regnery issued it primarily as a tool of the Bush campaign with the notion that it could get air time on right wing radio/cable shows such as Limbaugh or Scarborough or Fox which specialize in furthering Bush smear campaigns. Oddly enough, even some of the right wingers are gagging on this nasty slime job. <br /> <br />Vietnam vets --whether they ended up supporting the war or not -- should not be fighting each other. NO Vietnam veteran should be engaged on behalf of a draft-dodger in a smear campaign aimed squarely at the honorable service of Kerry -- and many others who served with him. You don't have to like Kerry's anti-war views, before, during and after his voluntary service for his country. But if you trash him, you trash yourself.	2004-08-21

But it is a cogent and eloquent plea for the American system. <br /> <br />Byrd does not go into his own dark past as a member of an American fascist group, the Ku Klux Klan, considered by many to be the first of the fascist movements. But he knows from his youth how the pressure to conform makes us weak in our liberties. <br /> <br />George Bush no doubt has no intention of destroying the American constitution. But there is little sign that he understands it or even read it. He surrounds himself with authoritarians with far right leanings.  <br /> <br />Byrd in his twilight asks that we look again at how we have gotten where we are. We need to confront not just this presidency, but any that would be so reckless and arrogant.  <br /> <br />And dammit, we'll stop gettting divided over wars when Congress stands up on its back legs and takes over the power to make war as it is constitutionally charged to do. Put the declarations of war up to a vote, not some wussy resolution.  <br /> <br />A president would not hesitate to defend the country, but neither would he be so inclined to go to war at the drop of a hat. Enough of these stupid adventures.  <br /> <br />Sadly, it's not limited to the war. We've had a reckless radical regime that is remaking regulations and simply acting -- without regard for not having won the popular vote.	2004-08-21

That regulation is clearly stated on his discharge that indicates he had not met his legal obligation to the Air National Guard. So he was forced intu the Reserves and given extra months.    Moore doesn't go into some of this. The Guard also had to look at his being AWOL, not meeting the minimum attendance standards. And there was the problem of the flight physical. Bush has one story. But the documents prove there's nothing to back up his version, just the order for him to get it done.    Bush could have resolved these questions any time with the simple stroke of a pen. Instead, as Moore documents, the Bush political staff had a general gather all the material, then they censored it before providing anything to the media. Much of it was duplicated and it was clear that many things were missing. Documents were never provided relating to his discharge, the Flight Inquiry Board about his refusal to obey orders to take the flight physical, etc.    What we don't know, because the Bushes conceal it, is whether the Guard decided to use the other issues to oust the wandering concaine snorting, alcoholic Lt. Bush. Or did they look his arrest on Cocaine charges and sentencing to community service and just say, that's enough. all the while aware they would have to consider his political connections.    Sometimes it's hard to tell. But what Moore makes clear withough any hysterics or too much interpretation is that Bush needs the coverup. The documents there tell the story.     If you've got an open mind, you'll find it hard to support Bush for anything, especially given his sending troops to Iraq just to get himself re-elected. But even if you still feel compelled to vote for Bush, you'll find it hard to trust this spoiled brat born with a silver spoon in his mouth who used influence and connections to avoid the consequences of his actions ....  and gotten richer at the same time without doing any honest work.	2004-05-15

Tyler moved to Alabama from Tennessee as a very young child and was involved in that state's politics for more than 50 years, 30 of them as a Senator. Louisiana never sent anyone named Morgan to the Senate (and only one to the House).<br />The book reads well, but a sloppy error like that makes you want to backtrack a lot of other information.	2004-04-22

So get in there quick and give it a one star and claim you've read it.<br />No wonder Condi Rice is squirming and finally talking about leaving government. She, among others, screwed it up. Richard Clarke had the decency to say he had made mistakes. <br />In fact, the book is a balanced and reasonably objective (more than that from a Washington insider you cannot ask) view from a real insider's perspective of what went wrong. And what is still going wrong, the reason we have thousands of young dedicated American soldiers coming home legless or worse and hundreds of others coming home in boxes. <br />It is more than just Bush's obsession with Iraq -- or his shameless use of this war as the essential core of his re-election campaign along with his trying to capitalize on the World Trade Center. In fact, Clarke is critical of many people, including Clinton, himself and others.<br />The problem is - that Bush is the one who's blown it in Mr. Clarke's opinion. And that's something the new American [hardliners] don't want to hear in their obsession. Pound down anyone who dares to speak out against this travesty.<br />We should have nailed Bin Laden in Afghanistan before we even considered doing anything else. And then, then we should have been damn sure. Instead, we're pouring out our treasure and our tax money to do in Iraq what the Bushes refuse to do in this country.	2004-03-27

But the facts are difficult to deny -- and strangely enough we now know more than ever about the utter dishonesty and corruption of this president and his entire family. <br />Phillips has written a first draft of the Bush history. There is little doubt that at some point in the future, a more detailed analysis of this dismal grouping of the gene pool will be exposed for what it is. What the Bushes do not resemble is the Adams family that also produced two presidents. While not perfect, the Adams actually had the interest of the United States at heart. The Bushes have the Bushes in mind and, such friends as they need to gain power. <br />We know that who your family is and who you know is critical to getting elected...not always bad.

The book is thorough and prescient.<br />Now we know why the fat idiot liked the dark studio bloviating into the ether. He was addled by enough drugs to destroy his hearing and have a criminal investigation launched. It's easy for him to blame the Democrats ... as Franken notes. But in this case, an assortment of judges are saying there's probable cause to belive Mr. Limbaugh committed a crime. In Florida, if it's prosecuted fairly and in line with previous cases with non-celebrities - who couldn't afford big buck lawyers, Rush is looking at a mandatory 3 years in the slammer, perhaps more depending on how many pills actually turned up in the records. One sheet of one pharmacy would have most people already in jail without bail. Nearly a half-million dollars in walking around cash money in convenient $9900 bundles -- in five months. <br />Maybe Jeb Bush can pull off another miracle and suddenly find Limbaugh innocent and give him a pardon or put political pressure on people to drop the case.

So, as anyone who reads this book with an open mind can tell, he just made it up as he went along.<br />You might not agree with that. But that just demonstrates that you are, like Limbaugh, a drug-addled nutcase. You probably feel that he doesn't belong in the slammer with the other criminals. But then, you feel drug laws only apply to people that you and Limbaugh don't like.

This book points the finger, carelessly and inaccurately, again and again. <br />So let's point the finger at how things ought to be. Stop mollycoddling right wing drug addicts. Send Limbaugh where he belongs.  The Slammer. The place with a big roommate to keep the big fat idiot company. This is not just for detox.

Coulter knows that only irrational right wing anger and excess, preferably with invented facts,  sells books. There's no political discourse here. <br />Liberals and Centrists, roughly 60 percent of the population, won't buy Coulter's books because, like this one, they are riddled with nonsense and hysteria pitched right at the fringe elements.<br />Coulter is angry in part because Clinton kicked George Bush out of office in 1992 and then steamrollered Bob Dole. If he had problems explaining what IS is, Clinton made fools of the right wing. For which they will never forgive anyone.  <br />The Clinton era was also an unprecedented period of economic growth, brought to a grinding halt by the Chickenhawk-in-Chief and his buddies who are making a killing in profits --- off the killing of American soldiers. Someone has to pay for the restoration of the Bush royal family.<br />But what is Coulter really ANGRY about? It must be pure lust. Clinton, who would hit on anything, apparently didn't even give this weirdo a look. <br />What Coulter dished in this book are not facts, but snarls of anger.<br />In the end, this book is a vindictive view of a president with serious personal weaknesses. Was that justification for removal from office. The vote was no. You are entitled to your opinion on that. <br />But why is Ms. Coulter not calling for impeachment of a president who lied to get us into war, using fabricated intelligence. And who, after the spectacular success of undermanned U.S. troops, commits them to an occupation for which he and his cronies have made no plans ... other than how Halliburton and Bechtel can profit from no bid secret contracts.<br />Mission Accomplished. NO WAY. This book doesn't accomplish anything -- except to take some money from gullible fools. I read it standing at Costco. Very low level.	2003-11-02

In the not so distant past, the author would have been found wearing a sheet over her pointed head while  she burned crosses and cursed Jews and Blacks or whoever else she hates. Or in Father Coughlin's audience. Or some other nutjob faction. <br />America's right has a disgraceful history of repressing blacks, fighting democracy in the United States, support apartheid at home and abroad and, not least, of helping to sneak thousands and thousands of their Nazi fellow travelers into the U.S. while expunging the files of their traitorous dealings with Hitler and his henchmen. It's a reality. Bush's family had dealings with the Nazis. American companies sold Tetraethyl Lead to the Nazis during the peak of the war so their fighter pilots could kill Americans. And this nut points the finger at people who did not profiteer from WWII as did the American Right. The right needs to be ashamed of its decade upon decade of bigotry that has embarassed this great nation.<br />But if this author could see her fingers in front of her face, she'd find that this great liberal democracy fought the Nazis and then the communists. And men like George Kennen, a international hard liner who happened to be a liberal devised the policy of strategic confinement. Kennen's policy ultimately led to the collapse of the Soviet Union.<br />The sad thing is that people earn money slinging mud like this at decent people, good Americans who have fought for their country and done more than any of the current lot of chickenhawks. You didn't know? They told you about Clinton. But they didn't tell you that everyone in this administration from Bush down is a draft dodger. Some, like Cheney, many times over. And warlord Wolfowitz said he was too busy.<br />Who's to blame. People like this author who have nothing but blame to offer and who have nothing rational to offer to our political system. Americans at fault. NO. PEOPLE LIKE THIS. <br />It's trashy polemic.<br />Ask yourself who's benefiting right now in Iraq. It sure is not our superb military or the reservists who have a leader who cannot articulate a legitimate reason for this war. But we're stuck. We're there and we have to support the troops.<br />Do we also have to let the friends of Dick Cheney and George Bush make even more billions? On no bid contracts to Halliburton that were negotiated while Cheney was at Halliburton? Utter corruption. American taxpayers sweat while the American right makes profiteers from this war and American troops die.	2003-10-29

Hightower may not be right about everything. But Kleptocrats is almost too kind a word for the crooks that George Bush brought into office.     I can't imagine what the right wing loonies would have done had Clinton started a war and then gave out tens of billions in profits to a company he controlled and another than is intimately connected to his party. That's Halliburton and Bechtel, both crony companies of this White House and, yes, Bush did wag the dog.    People from outside Texas have heard so much from Texas idiots, it sometimes seems as if there's no intelligent life there. Just this grasping, greedy need for power and to do as much damage to other parts of the country as possible. Hightower is proof, along with people like Molly Ivins, that there are still people in Texas in who can think independently.     No, they don't goose step down the strasser with the other crytofascists who use the catchall term, \\"conservative\\" to disguise their true nuttiness ... and just how much they actually despise American freedoms and beliefs. The people Hightower is talking about would lock up George Washington and most of the other founding fathers.     My god, they were revolutionaries who wanted sweeping changes. What a crazy liberal notion. But then to the extent there was support for the United States from Britain during the Revolution, it was the liberals. Conservatives wanted to keep their boot right on our necks.     So do the Kleptocrats.	2003-10-29

Phony flight suit militarism from a man who ducked even his National Guard service after getting a bye from the draft through string-pulling. Other Americans died in the service of their country while this brat was doing his military duty without ever showing up. He was too busy working on political campaigns.  <br /> After months of linking Iraq to Al Queda and the WTC attack, they said they'd never said anything like that. Just as Bush said those sailors put up the &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot; sign -- even though both the Navy and the White House say the White House provided the sign.<br />Don't get me wrong. The American military has done a good job, especially given the inept political leadership of this administration. <br />We had a well-definied mission in Afghanistan. Track down the people responsible for bombing the WTC. Getting Osama. But then the Chickenhawk-in-Chief gets sidetracked talking about folks who threatened to kill his daddy. <br />So far, as a result, we've had hundreds of Americans die and the Middle East is in more turmoil than ever. The walk-in-the-park liberation has turned into a mess. We can't get out, but we certainly need someone who can keep his or her eye on the target. <br />Osama first including the people who DIRECTLY supported him. Then we need to sit down and think about American security in the new age. It shouldn't be so different. Our freedoms are more important that the need for dysfunctional presidents to display their delayed onset manhood.<br />Bush's father was a decent man who made some mistakes and took some positive steps.

It's way too early to prognisticate whether Clark has a political life that will follow his military career.<br />But this book's insights into what happened in Iraq at the war's outset and what is happening now is excellent.<br />Cut through the bullpuckey. It was worth as always supporting the troops. They did their jobs damned well and give this country reason to be proud. The American military has grown and learned from its past. <br />Too bad nothing so positive can be said about the inept bunch of bumbling politicans and liars now in Washington. Bush incorporated, the restoration of America's ruling family even if they're all stupid. <br />America's military is in deep trouble.<br />Why? The reason is simple. American political leadership. Republicans got a pass as the right guys for the military -- and now they've shafted it.<br />The chickenhawk administration of draftdodger George Bush and his collection of right wing draft dodgers. Right, the same people who have mounted one vicious attack after another on others who did not serve. <br />Bush, the reluctant National Guard pilot who was AWOL for six years, and his administration have stretched the military too thin, deprived them of needed rest and resources and currently is giving volunteers reasons not to re-up. Bush and his cronies at Halliburton and all the rest who are profiting from the blood of American troops need to go. Bush gets his wings on a phony flight to a carrier loaded with folks who want to go home, but instead steam away from California so Karl Rove can have a photo op and shoot a campaign commercial. <br />Had the Republicans any honor, they would name a new candidate to replace the man who is bankrupting the country, enriching the obscenely wealthy and, who has lost the peace and the respect of the world that was won at such high price. Where is Osama and Saddam? And are we more secure? <br />General Clark provides a lot of answers and suggests a lot of solutions.  But in short, Bush has opened the barn door. And it isn't going to be fixed by three day wonders like Wolfowitz (his less than 72 hours in Iraq is closer than he's ever been in his life to the military. He's another draft dodger who's got a big Pentagon job thinking about places American soldiers can fight).<br />Bushy and Rummy fired the Army Secretary and the Army Chief of Staff who dared to suggest we needed a better plan for after the &quot;major conflict&quot; ended. Instead we got a mess where soldiers, missing their needed body armor, are picked off daily.<br />The real problem? The rest of the world knows more about the truth than we do. The British now know that Tony Blair and George Bush exaggerated and lied. One difference is that Tony Blair went to the Commons and asked for a vote up or down immediately before the invasion. Bush could not be bothered. But he's Teflon.<br />We know our soldiers fought well -- outstanding.Intimidation of the few good reporters and publications in the United States has accomplished what amounts to a coverup of all the Bush lies. WMDs. Not there. Iraqi Freedom? Bush Administration polls show 80 percent of the Iraqis consider us occupiers and want us out of their country. Because Bush, Rumsfeld (the Saddam hugger), Wolfy and the rest of the neocon draftdodging chickenhawks made no places for after the battle, Iraq is disintegrating. We can't leave and if we did, Saddam might be back in power in a matter of days.<br />And Osama, remember him. Bush got so focused on Iraq, which had nothing to do with Al Queda, that Osama's existence has continued quietly and prosperously for more than two year after he and his terrorists murdered thousands at the World Trace Center. <br />But you know. Bush doesn't think New Yorkers are really Americans. They voted Democratic and as Bush's house psychotic, Ann Coulter says, that means they'll all traitors and stupid. So why did Osama attack the people that Ann Coulter and the other looney loopers hate and despise so much.  <br />We do need to elect someone who can represent all of America, not just appeal to the anger of the various nut groups and neoNazis.<br />Have another Vicodin, Rush.

But it's worth the read in trying to understand the poisonous atmosphere that  rightwingers and others have created. For them, it's essential to find someone to blame. <br />Clinton could without question be a jerk. But Republicans were shaking in their boots at even the possibility of a constitutional amendment that would have allowed him to run again. Why? Because he would have taken the flight suit phoney to the cleaners. Why?<br />During Clinton's era, the United States balanced its budget and had the longest economic expansion in American history. There was no reason for it to end, but Bush's inauguration marked the downhill slide. The recession began in March, 2001. <br />How remarkable was that growth during Clinton's years? For starters, Reagan's policies drove the nation into recession and almost bankrupted the nation. Talking about the success Reaganomics is revisionism. The government he turned over to Bush the elder had a deficit ballooning out of control. Reagan generated the largest deficits in history and made it harder for anyone after him to balance the budget. Bush elder made a lot of mistakes, but he somewhat bit the bullet on taxes.<br /> Clinton had to take another bite on the bullet, and aside from taxes, cut spending,  amid dire projections by Hard Core Republican right wingers that the nation's economy would collapse. <br />The opposite happened. There was no recession during Clinton's years. The economy expanded each quarter and millions upon millions of new jobs were created. No, it wasn't Clinton's singular genius that did it, but what happened, worked.<br />How hard is that? Clinton served two full terms. No recession. That's not something you can say about Reagan or Eisenhower. In fact, you can't say it about any American President since WWII.  Ike had three -- and he wasn't a bad president.<br />The politics that Blumenthal dissects is the major reason leaders of substance have such difficultydealing with issues of substance. Theories about government spending are nice for whacko right wingers.<br />Social Security, which is self-financed although endangered by Bush, is one big expenditure. The Post Office is the biggest civilian employer, about 850,000, filling an essential role. But the big swallower of federal spending is the Pentagonm nearly 2.5 million people including troops and civilian employees. A great Army. But we can't get them body armor in Iraq.<br />Perhaps Blumenthal overrates his importance, but he is a realist and he, along with many others of right and left leaning pols, know the truth. You can't cut taxes at a time like this without taking great risks with both our security and our military. As it happens, that's exactly what is happening and if it were Clinton pulling this, the Clinton Wars of the past would be nothing to compare to this. As it is, Bush ambles along and the Right wing whines that he's being treated unfairly. SEriously conservative Republicans are horrified, but so afraid of White HOuse or Texas disfavor, that they pee on their office carpets as the country goes to hell. <br />Left wing Press. A myth. What we have a is a cowed, puppy-dog media that chews on rugs while looters destroy our country. Fox in charge of the foxes. There's nothing in this book that will make Washington reporters happy, even as they let Bush slide off the hook day after day.	2003-10-27

The military he left behind was potent and right now, a fair number of the people in Iraq aren't happy with their commander in chief who somehow never managed to show up for his National Guard duty -- a chicken hawk like most of his administration. <br />Bush and Rumsfeld in their campaign to avoid a 2004 election loss have endangered the present and long term security of the United States. They ignored clear warnings about terrorists. Ample evidence. <br />The war in Afghanistan made sense. But Alfred E. Neuman can't keep his eye on the target. Now, Bush and his regime are undermining the military by abusing it, overworking it, politicizing it and hiding their real agenda by an appeal to American patriotism. The last refuge of scoundrels.<br />In the meantime, American soldiers without adequate body armor are the targets in an increasingly hostile environment. How did that happen? Ask Bush. He wanted it. He did it.	2003-10-27

Those who practice their faith as best they can and who seek to raise their children with worthwhile belief. <br />Then there are the political \\"Christians\\" who aren't very Christian and who are intent on cramming their twisted views down everyone's thoats -- and grabbing political power. They have no respect for fellow Christians who do not want their children indoctrinated with someone's elses theology in school or in the courts or anywhere else paid for from tax money. And they have even less regard for those of other faiths. Tolerance, compasion and acceptance are Christian ideals. <br />Limbaugh should take a strong lesson about public morality and private cesspools from his drug-addled more famous brother. The Big fat idiot. <br />He should also learn the difference between Mississippi and Pennsylvania. He has the same careless regard for truth as his brother. Christians love the truth. It's not in this book.	2003-10-26

They dump on his academic credentials and compare him unfavorable to &quot;economists&quot; who are more agreeable to the Barney Fife in the Oval Office.<br />Krugman is a professional trained economist, who's work has undergone peer review by academics of both right and left persuasion. The proof being in the pudding, he has lauded the work of some economists generally considered to be to the right. The real problem is that the &quot;economists&quot; who challenge Krugman on economic theory and application don't have any credentials other than being political hacks for whatever regime happens to be in power. And the Bush regime, being the most inept ever in American history, and the most irresponsible has more to complain about than most when truth is being told.<br />Krugman in fact is not a liberal nor does he fit into the rubric of conservative. He doesn't see the government as being the answer to everything -- in fact he tends to think that government can mostly do wrong things. The Bush administration is doing those wrong things.<br />Its basis economic program seems to consist of lining the pockets of its very rich friends with millions of dollars in tax savings, exporting American jobs, a tax policy that encourages more American companies to move jobs overseas, a love for unchecked spending and a total disdain for the soaring deficit. <br />Krugman's work is a polemic, but don't make the mistake of thinking that this book does not have very solid and professional underpinnings. There isn't a lot of high-flying economic theory to explain some new circumstance. There's nothing new about the looters in the Bush Adminstration.<br />The truth here is that Krugman was one of the earliest to point out the economic disaster the Bush administration has given the nation. But now, almost every professional economist can see it and even the political hacks are realizing how bad things are. The Bush spinmasters are busily trying to put a positive face on everything -- and there's nothing like having him photographed in a flight suit, even though when he had a chance to wear a uniform in the Air Guard, he didn't bother showing up, just like the rest of the administration chicken hawks, lusting for a fight that they would never have fought. The trouble with this group is that not a single one of them have any knowledge of what our troops are actually doing. When they thought their numbers were being called, every one of them took a deferment dive. Nothing wrong with no serving, but do you really want ivory tower types making policy that puts American soldiers in the field, over-extended, too vulnerable and no plan.<br />The bill will come due at some point. And when it comes, we will have to find a way to pick up the check dropped on the table by the freeloaders and looters of the American nation. NOthing can so terrorize a nation as an administration who blames terror for every misdeed.	2003-10-15
US	52911316	R2EAJGZXCAPPT8	0525947647	857217799	Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them	Books	5	6	10	N	N	Putting a bayonet into a truly rotten heart	Al Franken's  satire does not appeal to me a great deal, but that's okay because there is less satire in this book than fact wrapped around some personal experience. The research is solid -- and the professional researchers properly credited.    No wonder that gasbag O'Reilly and Fox wanted to shut Franken up. Despite it's funny title, Lies and Lying liars is a solid book with a load of fact that demonstrates just what a fraud O'Reilly is, along with the rest of the Fox crowd. (So far as fair and balanced goes, all I see on Fox are Opinion gasbags. If there's any news, you have to hunt for it and then it's slanted and frequently unrelated to facts. Consider it just warmup for gasbag to follow).    So far as who's telling the truth, well it was Franken who said Rush Limbaugh was a big, fat idiot. Obviously he was right. But I wondered why he didn't call him a liar in that title. Because nothing Limbaugh said while frothing from the mouth was true. But Franken called him an idiot. That was a nice way of saying Limbaugh  may not have known he was a big fat liar because like so many of the hypocritical right wing extremists, he was popping so many pills it's hard to believe he found time to talk.    There we were, feeling sorry for Limbaugh because he'd gone deaf. If he'd leveled with us, we'd have known his pill popping did it. Feel sorry for poor Rushie! After all, everyone else who's ever had any pain became addicted to 400 pain pills illegally acquired. But when he's recovered, count on Rush to fess up and volunteer for one of those mandatory 10 year stretches people like him advocate for others. Wrong! Bet he'll tell you he shouldn't go to jail. Hey, he's got a lawyer who't get him off the hook. Keep him from paying the price. If black ghetto druggies were smart,  before the man comes about the drugs, they'd check into one of those high end rehab places that will keep people from asking questions?     By the way, whatever we do when it comes time to punish people like O'Lielly, don't put them in solitary with a mirror. Nothing Gasbag Bill likes to do more than listen to himself talk -- unless it's watching himself talk. HIs comments about the Fox lawsuit afterwards were fantastic. The judge effectively said the suit was idiotic and O'Lielly said he had to do it. Proof he's not only a liar, but an idiot. Too bad Hamfist and Milquetoast didn't join.    Get it straight folks. There's satire. Franken does that. With bite and a lot of fact.     Then there are the pompous right wing gasbags like O'Lielly. You can always recognize them because anyone who doesn't agree with them is a traitor, a slanderer  or a baby molester. Or was it that ditzy Ann Coulter who did that? Hard to tell them apart with all the shrill hysteria.    You need to understand something.     Rush and his friends get paid to entertain. They get paid to pander to the worst collection of idiots in the world. That's you if you're a listener. But that doesn't make you a bad person or a traitor. Just an idiot who's too stupid to turn off the talk radio and think for yourself. You're making this collection of life's losers feel important -- and rich enough to score lots of illegal drugs.     Maybe you could read something that challenges the way you've been told to think. You might read something by someone who is actually a thinking conservative, you know, the go slow socially and balance the budget folks,  instead of people whose idea of fun is to fill the streets with people in brown shirts. And maybe a torchlight book banning as a topper.    Resist all those blandishments to look for someone to blame for something that may not even be broken. Because almost certainly what you're hearing is either made up or so badly distorted, it should have been made up.     There was nothing Hitler feared more than the possibility that people might think for themselves. Stalin hated it too, so he sent people to the gulags for not thinking his way.    But hey, you can have it theBush-O'Lielly-Limbaugh way and have plenty of drugs and no punishment, big government spending and no taxes and a war everytime you think you're falling behind in the polls. Do what you're told or we'll bug your office, tap your phone and then think of something else.     Would a presidential candidate do that? And do something cheesy like a late convention in New YOrk so he can bask in the glory of September 11 -- and make people think he's a hero (instead of a draft dodger) just a few weeks before the election?     Sure. The only thing that matters is power. Why worry about the country when you can give your friends big tax breaks and fat no bid contracts in Iraq?     Hey, Halliburton is okay and so's their former CEO, Dick Cheney.	2003-10-15

The only people who haven't noticed are his mezmerized listeners who'd rather be crazy than have a brain. Ann Coulter is not worth reading or listening to given her divorce from fact, research and common sense, but some people think she looks good on TV. You might wonder if she's on something other than cigarettes to boost her oral tirades in which she confuses Arthur MacArthur with his son Douglas.<br />There's money to be made in appealing to the angry, disaffected, ineffectual people who suffer from sexual inadequacy, who want a government as dysfunctional as they are. A common failing on the far right, as exemplified by Adolph Hitler, who didn't care whether the government he destroyed was good or bad as long as he could take power. His hate speeches had as much truth in them as does Limbaugh's. (by the way, you should read some of Rush's stuff about America as world cop ... before it became fashionable for Republicans to do just that, however ineptly at whatever the cost to the world's best Army}.<br />  Professional historians were dumbstruck by the hyperbole of the \\"Werewolves\\" in reference to a non-existent German resistance after the War (Rice and Rummy). Few of them were as mystified as Professor Biddecombe, the English professor who wrote the source book and knew America's right wing was lying, including one think tank writer who claimed to have read \\"The Last Nazis.\\" Biddecombe said so in an interview. Just as the chicken-hawk neo-cons lied about the reasons for the Iraqi invasion, the end of \\"major combat,\\" the cost and all the rest. Now they're lying and making excuses about why American soldiers are dying in Iraq, too many of them because the Master Planners didn't plan for enough \\"Interceptor\\" bullet-stoppers to cover the grunts in the field. But they've got plenty of time and ability to pass out form letters to soldiers in Iraq and order them to send them back home to people as if they were bona fide -- all for bolstering the neo-con job. And they're pulling the wool over traditional american conservatives.<br />Now we have no choice but to clean up the mess in Iraq that these ideological chickenhawks have made. Generals who told the truth were pushed out of the way. At some point, someone will have to find the tax money to pay for the Bush largesein every direction, lining the pockets of administration friends with huge tax cuts and plenty of profits on the war to take to the bank. Huge deficit. Nothing conservative. Just looney. Real conservatives on matters fiscal are rolling over in their graves about the spend and spend and then borrow and borrow Bush policy.<br />All just a series of Big Lies and get Bigger every day. Conason has done an outstanding job of deconstructing the Big Lies that have mobilized assorted right wing fringe groups that have more in common with the Ku Klux Klan than American yeomanary -- the centrist Americans who are tired to death of this polarized insanity that assorted nut jobs have foisted off on us. Bush will likely be re-elected behind a huge smokescreen of lies and by 2008, we'll have an economy in more trouble than Argentina. Some think we're close now. Debt matters. Spending at some point must be brought into balanace with revenue. And revenues would never grow to cover the Bush deficits if the economy shot to the moon. Unlike his father, the first Bush, this one has not got the courage to call off his reckless progam and see that the country can at least come closer to paying its bills.<br />Clinton despite his foibles did it (thanks to Rubin) and the US had the longest period of properity in history. Bush destroyed the world's greatest economy in weeks. But it's all someone else's fault. The media.<br/>The media is a collective of cheerleaders and bent-kneed weaklings who don't dare to go further in expose the dishonesty of this regime that acts like a monarchy.<br />Our toopers in Afghanistan needed help and support (not cheerleading) to do their tough job of finding bin Laden and his cohorts -- not more terrorists. Now our troopers in Iraq need real support, not political propaganda aimed at the next election and spending aimed at fat cat companies who take their jobs overseas.<br />Unlike our commander in chief, they don't have the option of being so busy doing other things, they can't show up enough to maintain their flight status. Can't see guys getting out humvees and saying, \\"Daddy told me it was all right.

Which way to turn. Crossroads? More like filler. Lazy and pedestrian.  I don't mind long or rich - or both. Crossroads is like a cowboy movie with everything cut out but looped segments of riders and horses going forth and back and getting nowhere. Setup? The previous nine were also setups. Stay tuned? For what? He closed out book nine with Rand cleansing the Source -- but it takes him 300 pages of repetitious nonsense to get back to Rand and then wobbles badly. .... Like anyone else who's read the first 10 books, I'll probably read the next. I have an investment in the rich fantasy world Jordan has created. ...  Every woman is in danger of becoming a cardboard Barbi simulation that swallows up the occasional great beauty Jordan once knew how to describe.  Jordan delights in muddling up his work repeatedly with names of minor characters that are too similar to more important characters. At this rate he doesn't need a glossary, but an index to keep the names straight.  Etc. ... Setup? This is a muddled mess. When Jordan is trying, he's as taut as anyone, no matter the length. Write as long as you want to, Mr. Jordan, but get back to the quality of the first three. If you're dedicated to this series as many of us are, don't buy the hardback. Wait until the next in the series comes out, buy Crossroads in paper and hope that Jordan rouses himself. At least the two books together will make more sense than a year apart....	2003-02-03

It does not quite qualify even as \\"faction.\\" Only the fact that Amazon][.com]requires at least one star gets it that -- undeserved.<br />The book is a waste of time and money relentlessly flogged into the marketplace by an purely commercial author who is more successful at fiction than non-fiction, fiction that only raises a semblance of reality.<br />Ms. Cornwell has invested a tiny portion of her considerable wealth in this book, but she'll get it  back and much more as a result of the hype and the phony claim that she has \\"solved\\" the Ripper case. Less risky than contemporay cases. No lawsuits. <br />This book has been savaged by every knowledgeable reviewer, in particular those with knowledge of the REAL world of forensics and the history of the case. There is little that could be added to the NYTimes review of December 15, 2002 which dismisses Ms. Cornwell's \\"work\\" as \\"A sloppy book, insulting to both its target and its audience.\\"  <br />ABC showed no respect for the truth when 20/20 aired a burbling fawning tribute to Ms. Cornwell earlier this year and her breathless claim that she had at last found the true Ripper. <br />Ms. Cornwell, who seems in search of relief for the tedium for all the money she made from earlier (not bad) work, acts as though she is the first to discover Walter Sickert. Wrong, although there's no evidence that he is the Ripper. She boasts of ignoring evidence and creates her own speculative material.<br />Cornwell boasts of the work by the Virginia Institute of Forensic Science and Medicine. Which tends to support her writing and that has blurbs on its website about the woman who solved the Ripper crimes. Except ... while the Virginia Institute of Forensic Science and Medicine exists, it's Patricia Cornwell's money, deductible from her taxes of course that paid for it. Her money buys criminal science to the extent there is any in this book.<br />Ms. Cornwell likes to talk about her days in the Medical Examiner's office in Richmond and \\"hundreds of autopsies\\" but does not talk about what she did. She was apparently clerical staff. NO one wants to talk about that now. She's given forensics some cache and helped build false expectations.<br />Solved the Ripper case? No, conducted a successful campaign to sell a book without content of any merit. It's a RIPPER-OFF.	2002-12-22

My wife and I first used this book in 1980 with our first German Shepherd, a beautiful, gentle and easy to train dog despite strong alpha characteristics. We've given away many copies because it is about so much  more than training. The monks have worked with each of our German Shepherds  but their approach works with other breeds. Yes, there is a section on  physical discipline but there is also a stern caution. This book deserves  to read as a whole. We've read it and re-read it over the years, most  recently on the death last week at 14 of a great, sensitive and intelligent  old girl who was a loyal companion every day of her life. We used the monks  excellent puppy book with our other dog, an aging male GSD, and soon it  will be time for it again as another companion enters our home. Monks?  Dogs? Religion? Don't worry about it. There's nothing to offend anyone. New  Skete takes its religious life very seriously, but they are not intrusive.
