Since then he got and then married a former editor at the Harvard Business Review who's the co-author of this book. He's also spent a lot of time giving speeches and answering questions from audiences.<br /><br />The book is based his answers to those questions.  But we don't get the answers raw, or even straight from the gut.<br /><br />Jack got to deliver many of the same answers over and over, giving him time to reflect and clarify his own expression. Then, Jack's wife Suzy crafted, shaped, and sharpened the answers still further.<br /><br />The knowledge you get from this book is like the ingredients in a great soup.  Quality ingredients are critical if you want a great soup.  But the cooking, the interaction with other ingredients and the ministrations of a good cook make the final product better than the sum of the parts.<br /><br />There are four key ingredients in Welch's soup.  People are the most important thing.  Candor is essential.  The business race is more like a marathon than a sprint.  To win the race you need the minimum amount of planning and the maximum amount of running.<br /><br />Just like in a soup, the ingredients interact and intertwine.  They show up in every section and almost every chapter.  They make this a very rich soup indeed.  But it is not a perfect soup.<br /><br />Welch was the CEO of a very big company for more than two decades and spent his entire working life there.  Those facts make a difference in how much of this book will be valuable for you.<br /><br />This book is written with a big company perspective. If you're in a smaller company, especially a micro-business, you will probably find whole sections of this book, such as the one on Mergers and Acquisitions, entirely irrelevant.<br /><br />This book is written with a CEO's perspective.  If your position is closer to the middle or the bottom of the organizational chart, you will probably find whole sections of this book frustrating because they offer ways to change processes that you experience, but don't command.  You'll probably find the discussions of changing the performance appraisal and budgeting processes interesting and stimulating, but unable to offer you anything concrete you can achieve.<br /><br />Pick up a copy of the book and look through it.  Or, use the \\"Look Inside the Book\\" feature on Amazon.  Check out sections that interest you to see if they offer value you can use. Even if you find whole sections that won't help you, though, I think you'll find several things in this book that are worth the cover price all by themselves.<br /><br />In general, the section on leadership is excellent, with rich advice on hiring and firing.  No matter what business or organizational position you're in, you'll find value here.<br /><br />The section on handling a crisis is written from that big company perspective.  But it's also chock-full of wisdom for anyone who's going to face a crisis, which is everyone.<br /><br />If you're looking for \\"how-to\\" advice, you may find it here, but check out the book before buying to be sure.

Some don't like it, because they perceive Lewis V. Gerstner as arrogant.  Some don't like it, because his tenure at IBM saw thousands of people lose their jobs.  Some don't like it, because they don't think there is anything new here.  I like this book.<br /><br />I like the book, because it is one of the most cogently and personally presented stories I've seen of a major corporate turnaround by the person who was in the CEO's job at the time.  Here's a quick outline of the story.<br /><br />Gerstner became Chairman and CEO of IBM in April, 1993.  At that time, IBM, once the icon of American management, was in big trouble.  The deathwatch was on.  The conventional wisdom among the pundits was that IBM needed to be broken up and sold off piece by piece to create lots of small businesses that would create income for shareholders.<br /><br />This was the heyday of the dot com boom.  Smaller, networked computers were expected to rule the future. Big mainframe computers, the stuff that IBM sold, were supposed to be the troglodytes of American business, and heading for extinction.<br /><br />Gerstner came to IBM after being a McKinsey consultant and after a successful eleven-year career at American Express, and four years as Chairman and CEO of RJR Nabisco.  He describes what he calls \\"the courtship\\" that brought him to IBM in the beginning of this book.<br /><br />The company he took over was once seen as the very model of the best in management.  When I was starting out in business some thirty-five years ago, we looked to IBM as an exemplar of all that was good, effective and profitable.  In 1982, Peters and Waterman featured IBM in \\"In Search of Excellence,\\" with a long list of references in the index.<br /><br />But by the time Gerstner took over many of the things that had made IBM great had fossilized. Many of the practices that had been touchstones had turned into radioactive rocks.<br /><br />Gerstner started off with three critical challenges.  He needed to stop the hemorrhaging of cash and stabilized the company.  He needed to learn enough about the business and the people he had walked into to make good strategic choices.  And he needed to put together a strategy to turn IBM around.<br /><br />This book tells us about how he did all of those things.  It does so candidly and that's one of the reasons I like the book.<br /><br />While lots of people see Gerstner as arrogant, I found him, at least in this book, to be humble.  That doesn't mean that he didn't think he had a lot to offer and had made lots of good decisions.  It does mean that he understood that many of his decisions didn't work out the way he thought, and some of his ideas weren't the best.  Those get play, too, and that's rare in a book like this.<br /><br />I also appreciated the refreshing style of the book.  It was not written with a ghostwriter or co-author.  Gerstner did it himself.  The language may not be the language that a professional writer would have chosen.  But it is the language that's common to businesspeople everywhere, and that makes this a good read.<br /><br />The big advantage of this is that we get a real view inside the head of someone who led a successful corporate turnaround. We don't get a view that's filtered through a collaborator.<br /><br />Because Gerstner wrote the book, it's short on some of the details that might be here if a business historian or journalist did the writing.  For my money, that's OK, because this is a real inside view.<br /><br />This book is for you if you want a lucid discussion of a difficult turnaround process by the CEO who did the CEO's job.  It is all of that and a good read besides.ad fossilized.

It's an intellectual romp.  But there are problems.  Let's leave those for a moment and concentrate on the good parts.<br /><br />We're told early on that economist Steven Levitt is very good at asking questions.  Indeed, he is.  He's also good at using the tools that he's mastered as an economist to answer some of those questions in novel and interesting ways.  That's why this book is a charmer.  Consider some of the questions as used in the chapter titles:<br /><br />What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? (This chapter is about incentives, how they work in the world and how you can analyze them.)<br /><br />How is the Ku Klux Klan like a group of real estate agents?  (This one looks at the power of information in markets.)<br /><br />Why do drug dealers still live with their moms?  (Which talks about \\"the conventional wisdom,\\" a term coined by John Kenneth Galbraith.)<br /><br />Where have all the criminals gone?  (Facts and fiction of crime, we're told.)<br /><br />What makes a perfect parent?  (Which works on answering a different question like \\"do parents matter?\\")<br /><br />Perfect parenting part 2:  Would a Roshanda by any other name smell as sweet?<br /><br />Levitt's answers to these questions and others are tightly reasoned, interesting, and often provocative.  They're what make the book worth reading.  Whether you think they're enough to make the book worth buying depends on how you react to some of the problems.<br /><br />There's a problem with hype. Start with the title.<br /><br />This is not \\"Freakonomics.\\"  Levitt uses the same tools that other economists use.  His conclusions are not unique.  They are fascinatingly phrased and intended for a general, rather than an academic audience, but they're still pretty mainstream.<br /><br />Levitt is not a \\"rogue economist\\" either, as the jacket claims.  Instead, he's a very well respected economist.  He just received the John Bates Clark medal that's awarded every two years to the person judged the best American economist under forty.<br /><br />There are also problems with the book itself.  It's really fun and fast-moving up to page 179.  At that point the authors seem more intent on filling out the page count than on being interesting.  Analysis and prose which have tripped along lightly till now begin to slog through a look at American first names.<br /><br />There is another problem with the content.  Throughout the book, we're offered a series of interesting, thoughtful, well-reasoned and interestingly presented but hardly comprehensive arguments.  Other points of view are ignored or quickly blown off.<br /><br />For example, according to the authors, there is one cause for the decline in the crime rate, and that cause is the Roe v Wade decision.  Levitt makes a good case for this, but he only analyzes national factors.  A more thorough analysis might also compare different crime rates in different cities and seek out causes for the disparities.<br /><br />Crimes rates in New York and Chicago should both would benefit from the abortion ruling.  But those cities have followed different policing strategies and they have very different murder rates.<br /><br />In fact, Chicago, with about a third of New York's population actually had more murders in 2001.  Levitt doesn't explain this, or even address the issue of local differences.<br /><br />Throughout the book a tendency to offer Levitt's one right answer, rather than an interesting insight into a complex question.  My problem is not with the analysis that Levitt offers us; it is with the limited nature of what is analyzed.<br /><br />The bottom line for me is that this is a fascinating and interesting book.  It is a great read most of the way.  But there are problems.  I won't be taking my copy back, but you may want to think twice before you spend your money for this book.economist.

His influence was so powerful and so pervasive, that many things we now take for granted were concepts that he pioneered and if you hear about Taylor at all, it's usually with a strong negative judgpment.<br /><br />Taylor, who did some of the very first efficiency studies, is vilified as the person who tried to turn people into machines.  He's seen as the progenitor of the efficiency studies.  The first of those assumptions is partially true, and the second is certainly true that needs to be set in context..<br /><br />What author Robert Kanigal has done is clean up the facts and set Taylor in context.<br /><br />He does this with an excellent history/biography.  We learn that Taylor, who came from a wealthy background, also spent time working in machine shops.  We find him learning as much from that process as from formal education; and claiming at times that the practical experience of working in a shop is necessary to understand industry - or at least industry as it was developing when he did his studies.<br /><br />That time was the late 19th and early 20th Century.  Even though the Industrial Revolution had been going on for awhile, factories were still developing into what we know them as today. Taylor showed how individual workers could be more efficient and effective.  This was great for production, but not always popular with the workers he studied.<br /><br />Taylor's studies gave rise to what was called \\"scientific management\\" and laid the groundwork for later \\"efficiency experts\\" like the Gilbreaths of  \\"Cheaper by the Dozen\\" fame. His legacy is both positive and negative.<br /><br />Part of his positive legacy is that Taylor demonstrated that you could actually study the way work was done and make improvements in the process.  That's a powerful insight and like most powerful insights, it can be used for good or ill.<br /><br />One of Taylor's famous studies, for example, tried to determine the most efficient way to shovel coal into steel mill furnaces. Taylor found that the mill could make great improvements in efficiency by changing things like the location of the pile of coal, the design of the shovel, and by allowing the shovellers to take periodic rest breaks.<br /><br />Lots of folks who owned factories loved things like this.  They got the shovels.  The located the pile of coal where Taylor suggested.  But they often left out things the didn't like, such as those periodic rest breaks.<br /><br />What Taylor gave the world were powerful methods of analysis that can make factories and shops  and offices more effective.  In that sense, he would be the grandparent of techniques like operations research, statistical quality control and kaizen.<br /><br />But, like the rest of us, Taylor was a product of his times, of his breeding, and of his experience.  Like the rest of us, he had human flaws. The strength of this book is that it gives you a look at the whole picture.<br /><br />You get to see just how remarkable Taylor's insights were, and how his life and experience shaped those insights.  You get to see how others took what he had to say and used it both for good and for ill.  And you get that all in a well-written biography that will hold your attention.ies, for example, tried to determine the most efficient way to shovel coal into steel mill furnaces.

There are books that will tell you the latest fad in business strategy and strategic planning. There are textbooks on strategy written for students in graduate management programs.<br /><br />There are innumerable memoirs, and books purporting to connect military strategy to business strategy. There are books about strategy that are actually historical studies of one kind or another. There are great philosophical tomes like Von Clausewitz's masterpiece On War. But there are very few books that are short, well written, and filled with enough wisdom that you keep going back to them. Two of those books are Sun Tzu's classic The Art of War and Warfighting: The U. S. Marine Corps Book of Strategy.<br /><br />Both are very short. Both are packed with wisdom that you can apply in a variety of situations. Of the two, though, I'd pick Warfighting as the book you \\"must have\\" if you're going to make sense of strategy.<br /><br />Warfighting is the contents of FMF-1, the manual of U. S. Marine Corps doctrine which is distributed to all Marine officers. Rumor has it that it was personally penned by General Al Gray, the 29th Commandant of the Marine Corps and a significant figure in Marine Corps history.<br /><br />Unlike most commandants since the early 20th Century, Gray enlisted in the Marines and rose to the rank of Sergeant before being commissioned in 1952. He was commandant from 1987 to 1991. The first thing he changed was how the commandant dressed.<br /><br />Most commandants, before and since, wore the Marine dress uniform as their working attire.  Gray wore utilities, the working attire of the vast majority of Marines.  He drank from a canteen cup emblazoned with four stars.<br /><br />He not only changed the way the commandant looked, he changed what was expected of Marines.  He started by creating a required reading list for both commissioned and non-commissioned officers, the only such list in any of the services.<br /><br />He made changes in Marine leadership training, increasing the emphasis on training in how to think, not what to do.  And he created the doctrine of the Marines that you will read in this book.  Whether he actually put down the words or not, this is his book and it's excellent.<br /><br />Warfighting is extremely well written and develops in a logical progression, yet it's still a book that you can dip into for a nugget of wisdom here and there. You can also read it through in a single sitting.<br /><br />Warfighting is a book that's easy to adapt, whether you're studying ancient military campaigns in a class in history or thinking about business strategy. It's also a book written by a modern Westerner and, therefore it has a more straightforward and less elliptical style than the Sun Tzu classic.<br /><br />Both books are good. I have both. I use them with clients. I find that my clients spend time puzzling over Sun Tzu, trying to tease meaning from the translation of a text written in a different language, hundreds of years ago.  When they read Warfighting, they spend their time adapting what they've read to their business situations.<br /><br />The best recommendation I can give you on this book is to tell you that I usually have several copies around. I keep them to give to clients and friends because what they read in Warfighting helps them do a better job of creating strategies for their businesses.the only such list in any of the services. <br /> <br />He made changes in Marine leadership training, increasing the emphasis on training in how to think, not what to do.

US	52750742	R3JQTYF068CL4F	0029182301	439947838	The General Managers	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Effective Leadership Techniques	This is the book that started it all for Dr. John Kotter.  It's still a classic.<br /><br />When Dr. Kotter set out to study general managers there was at least one thing he was pretty sure he'd find.  He was sure they'd be great time managers.  After all, that was the great management effectiveness builder of the age.<br /><br />Back then, time management was supposed to involve the careful auditing and controlling of time use.  Good time managers were expected to carefully plan their days and then rigorously work their plan.  But what Kotter discovered was something very different.<br /><br />He discovered that effective general managers seemed more flexible than their peers.  They were constantly engaging in ad-hoc, hallway meetings and using those occasions to covey their important messages.<br /><br />What Kotter had stumbled upon was less a variation in good time management practice than it was an effective communications strategy.  Senior managers, indeed, any managers, can only effectively communicate a few important things in the time available.<br /><br />Kotters general managers knew this.  So they made sure they knew what the most important messages were that they needed to get across.<br /><br />They also understood that their important messages needed to be simple and repeated over and over again.  They learned to seize whatever opportunities presented themselves and use them to share their key message.<br /><br />Time management has come a long way since this book was written.  Just compare any time management book from the 70s with David Allen's \\"The Art of Getting Things Done.\\"<br /><br />Communications channels have changed as well.  Now there is voicemail and email.  There are wireless phones, Wi-Fi hotspots, and email-enabled pagers.<br /><br />If the general managers that Kotter studied were dropped into today's world, I'm sure they would face Rip-van-Winkle-like adjustments.  They'd have to learn a lot about technology.<br /><br />But they'd still understand that basics of good supervision, management and leadership.  That's what this book is about and why it's worth reading.> <br />But they'd still understand that basics of good supervision, management and leadership.

Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. It must have been one heck of a course.<br /><br />The subtitle of this book is \\"The Uses of History for Decision-Makers.\\" That could actually be broadened a bit to something like \\"The Uses of Precedents and Analogies for Decision-Makers.\\"<br /><br />Remember when we were debating going to war in Iraq?  How many times did you hear the precedent of Viet Nam invoked?<br /><br />And, if you're old enough, remember Viet Nam?  How many times did you hear about Munich?<br /><br />How many times in business have you heard a colleague invoke a historical precedent to justify a particular course of action?<br /><br />We use historical precedents and analogies all the time. Most of the time we use them as if history repeats itself.  It doesn't.<br /><br />Mark Twain's aphorism captures best what really happens.  \\"History does not repeat, but it does rhyme.\\"  This book will give you tools that you can use to sort out what's the same (the rhymes) and what's different and then use your analysis to make better decisions.<br /><br />The authors introduce you to methods that will help you sort things out in all kinds of different situations. They teach you about separating \\"facts\\" into known, unknown, and presumed. They discuss analyzing precedents that you're about to base a decision on in terms of likes and differences from the current situation.<br /><br />By itself, no individual idea or tool is unique. None of this is rocket science. But the authors give you a systematic application of common sense and proven techniques. That system gives you power.<br /><br />There are lots of little \\"sidebar\\" points as well. For example, there's the Goldberg Rule.<br /><br />That rule tells you not to ask, \\"What's the problem?\\" Instead ask, \\"What's the story?\\" I picked up that technique from this book when I first read it years ago and I've used it ever since in my consulting work and research. Try it. You'll like it.<br /><br />There's also Dr. Alexander's question, which: \\"What fresh facts, if at hand, by when, would cause you to change your presumption?\\" Instead of presumption, you can insert direction, or recommendation. This simple question forces decision-makers in a group to look at underlying assumptions and to look at when those assumptions need to be changed. It, too, is simple and powerful.<br /><br />The techniques in this book will definitely help you sharpen your decision-making skills.  But there's an added benefit for you if you're a history buff. You'll enjoy the anecdotes and analysis of historical events, such as The Bay of Pigs, where one of the authors was an advisor.<br /><br />There are a lot of books on decision-making.  This is the only one I'm aware of that deals clearly and systematically with the use of precedent and historical analogy.I've used it ever since in my consulting work and research. Try it.

You'll enjoy the anecdotes and analysis of historical events, such as The Bay of Pigs, where one of the authors was an advisor. <br /> <br />There are a lot of books on decision-making.  This is the only one I'm aware of that deals clearly and systematically with the use of precedent and historical analogy.   <br />	2005-05-01

The author describes just about every topic he covers in terms of three key components, which he then presents as sides of a triangle.<br /><br />One key topic in the book involves possibilities.  The three sides of that triangle are seeing, describing and pursuing.<br /><br />There is a chapter called The Three C's of Leadership.  That triangle has sides named challenge, confidence, and coaching.<br /><br />After a while you go a little triangle crazy.  But that's not the only problem with this book.  Consider the chapter about self-fulfilling prophecy.  The triangle for that chapter is assumptions, expectations, and reactions.<br /><br />The triangle here is less than helpful.  The muddled writing makes things even worse. Thornton is talking about what everyone else calls the Pygmalion Effect but he uses very different language so you have to work harder than you might otherwise.<br /><br />There are similar problems throughout the book.  The organization is not tight.  The metaphors are not consistent.  The writing is not clear, and some things seem like they are thrown in just to fill up enough pages to get above a hundred.<br /><br />\\"But, is it worth reading?\\" I hear you cry.  The answer to that one is an emphatic \\"it depends.\\"<br /><br />This book is a collection of thoughts about leadership by an experienced manager.  Many of those thoughts are insightful and they can be helpful. How much value you get from this book will depend a lot on your own experience level.<br /><br />If you are a relatively experienced manager yourself, you will probably find a thing or two in here that you can carry away. What you get will be worth the price of the book.<br /><br />If you have access to the author, in one of his classes, on a tele-seminar or at a speech where you can ask questions, this book will probably be helpful.  In those situations you can ask questions to clarify things or hear the nuance of oral presentation.<br /><br />But if you are a new manager, out there by yourself, beware of this book.  There are good things here, but the organization and the writing style can make them very hard to tease out. It's very easy to see only part and not the whole of what Thornton is trying to convey.<br /><br />This is also one of those \\"leader as hero\\" books. You are treated to statements like this.  \\"Leaders help individuals, teams, and organizations become more and achieve more than they ever thought possible.  Why do they do it?  They have a burning desire to make a difference.\\"<br /><br />Or this.  \\"Leaders have desire, passion, and energy for their vision.  They are excited about the possibilities they see for people, teams, and organizations they are leading.  Leaders know their actions will make a difference.\\"<br /><br />Evidently lust for power and position and naked ambition don't show up among the leaders in Mr. Thornton's world.  That makes his world different from the one that I inhabit, where those things are a regular part of the landscape and altruistic motives often remain well hidden.<br /><br />There's one more problem area if you're a new manager. There is lots of advice about what to do, but not much guidance about how to do it. If you want to learn the basics, go to other books like Kouzes and Posner's The Leadership Challenge.<br /><br />If you have been around the leadership game for a while, this book will give you the insights and opinions of another experienced manager.  You'll see things differently; understand the way another manager understands them.  That may be worth the price of the book.

The authors are principles of Spencer Stuart, an executive search firm.<br /><br />They should be in a pretty good position to identify top business leaders and to study some of the factors that make them successful. They do, in fact, identify what they say are fifty of the best business leaders in America at the time the book was written.<br /><br />It would make more sense if the subtitle were something like \\"Interviews with Fifty of America's Top Business Leaders.\\" That would be much more like truth in advertising.<br /><br />It would deal with the problem of identifying these folks as THE best business leaders. These are fifty folks who were viewed as top business leaders at the time the book was written.<br /><br />As the authors say, that list is fluid and no single search could probably uncover all of the top business leaders. The folks listed here are leaders who've been covered by the business press. You won't find top leaders from smaller companies, or even leaders from big companies that haven't gotten much press coverage.<br /><br />The list is also fixed in time. Bernie Ebbers, Hank Greenberg, Dennis Kozlowski and Ken Lay, all are on the list. They probably wouldn't be today, unless you were compiling a list of famous felons.<br /><br />This book gives you an interview with each of fifty folks who were viewed as very successful business leaders. Each one talks about where they work and what they do and what matters to them. That's what this book is really about and why it's valuable.<br /><br />What you've got here is fifty selections of wisdom and insight from people who are successful in business. They are articulate and insightful people. The represent a broad range of personal styles and backgrounds. And they're valuable because we know how some of their stories came out.<br /><br />In addition to the felons, there are other folks on this list who aren't doing what they did back then.  Jack Welch and Larry Bossidy have both moved from CEO to guru.  Michael Eisner and Lou Gerstner have retired.<br /><br />Read this book for the individual insights. All of the survey stuff that surrounds the interviews is just there to flesh out the book and make it look scientific.<br /><br />Don't read this book all the way through. Dip into it and read a couple of interviews at a time and compare them. Mark passages that are insightful or inspiring for you and go back to them.<br /><br />It's a book worth reading, but not for the reasons stated on the book's cover and not because all the folks in it turned out to be either top performers or stellar human beings.

There are probably an equal number about creativity.  This book is about creativity in business.<br /><br />This book is the distillation of the course that Michael Ray and Rochelle Myers taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.  It is theoretical.  It is practical.  It is wonderful.<br /><br />The special delight of this book is the mixing of the theoretical and the research findings with the practical applications.  The authors present us with points, then give us stories and examples from the world of business and underpinnings from the world of scientific and psychological research that help explain why the examples work.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book to give you a quick, simple way to come up with creative ideas in business, though, this ain't it.  This is a book that presents you with tools and some understanding of why they work, so that you can apply them in your life and in your business.  The key to the book is the title of one of the very first chapters: \\"Business As Art.\\"<br /><br />To practice an art, you must be creative.  You must go beyond the established norms and rules.  But you must also master some craft.  This book will give you an introduction to the craft of creativity, an introduction to the ways that you can make your creativity not only more effective, but more powerful as a transformer of your business.	2005-04-06

I'm glad that didn't stop me from reading Nancy Koehn's book, \\"Brand New: How Entrepreneurs Earned Consumers Trust From Wedgwood to Dell.\\"<br /><br />Koehn is a professor at no less than the Harvard Business School.  She is also an excellent writer, and she understands that the essence of getting good information across is stories.  Brand New is a book of stories about branding. It is anything but boring.<br /><br />Koehn divides the book into two giant sections, The Past and The Present.<br /><br />In The Past, she includes the stories of Josiah Wedgwood, H. J. Heinz and Marshall Field.  All the stories are told in detail enriched by facts, insights, and quotes.  All of them contain lessons for today's businessperson. Most of the lessons are about branding, but there's a lot more.<br /><br />Read this book and you will find out all about how Josiah Wedgwood changed the common practice by impressing his own name in the unfired clay of his works.  That's impressive.  But you will also learn how his partnership with Thomas Bentley took Wedgwood's strengths and his insight about branding and turned them into a highly profitable business.<br /><br />You'll learn about why H. J. Heinz packed his product in glass jars and how he kept control of his distribution.  You'll hear about the 1902 giant opening at Marshall Field's and you'll learn about Field's varying relationships with his partners.<br /><br />In the section on The Present, you will get the story of Estee Lauder and how she changed not only her name and image but also the face of cosmetic marketing through magnetism and incredible persistence.  You'll hear how Howard Schultz wound up at Starbucks Coffee and why it bears his imprint, and you'll hear about Michael Dell without overmuch mention of the legendary dorm room.<br /><br />The stories themselves make delightful reading, but the learning is probably even more important than the enjoyment.  These stories illustrate how specific, successful entrepreneurs took a look around at things that were happening in society and developed products and brands and marketing and distribution systems to take advantage of them.  These insightful and inspiring stories will help you understand your own business and find ways to make it more profitable.s make delightful reading, but the learning is probably even more important than the enjoyment.

The study itself began in 1972 and collected data on over 3,000 business units in 450 corporations for periods ranging from two years to over a decade.<br /><br />Even twenty years after its original publication, there isn't anything quite like it. Because of the way the material is presented, you can analyze different factors operating to see how they might affect your business. You can look at Picking Profitable Markets or the Impact of Market Position on Profitability or Why Quality is the Premier Driver of Profitability and then relate the principles to your own operation.<br /><br />You can do this by reading the book all the way through from front to back, or by dipping into the chapters that seem to offer you help for a current problem. If you're I doubt about where to start, let me suggest Why Quality is the Premier Driver of Profitability.  It's a chapter I ask my clients to read when we're working on strategy.<br /><br />A lot of the material in this book is timeless. You'll find data and recommendations that are just as valuable today as when the book was published and that will be valuable ten years from now.<br /><br />There are problems, though. While some of the research findings may be timeless, the book is still a product of its time. You'll find discussions of \\"Portfolio Planning\\" methods, which were in vogue at the time the book was written. You'll find the authors using language and reacting to issues that will sound somewhat dated. Nevertheless, the solid truth and research support that exists in this book makes it worth buying.	2005-03-20

Since the time human beings crawled out of caves, stories have been the way that we pack lots of information into a digestible package.  John Steele Gordon is a great storyteller, and this book is full of great business stories.<br /><br />If your idea of the business book is the macroeconomics text that you slogged through when you were in college, the Business of America will come as a pleasant surprise.  You'll find yourself engaged with the material and learning a lot about the history of American business and how business is done that you simply wouldn't get any other way.<br /><br />Gordon writes the \\"The Business of America\\" column for American Heritage Magazine, and the stories that he tells there are the stories he tells here.  He has divided the books into several sections.  There are stories of the early days of the American dream that focus on the first years of Europeans on this continent up through about the Civil War.  Other sections are divided into topical areas, such as Farming and Food, Manufacturing and Mining, Transportation, Banking, the Business of War, Business and Government, Retailing and Real Estate, and the Telegraph, Telephone, and Television.  The final section is called After Hours.<br /><br />Each of these sections includes several stories.  There wasn't a single one of them where I didn't underline something or put an exclamation point in the margin, or write a note to myself.  These stories are insightful, because Gordon understands the basics of how business works and the oddities of the human condition.<br /><br />There are several stories that deal with how technology, in this case the cotton gin and the sewing machine and the steam engine, transformed whole industries.  Gordon backs up his stories with facts.<br /><br />For example, in the section called, \\"King Cotton,\\" Gordon tells us:  \\"Only five hundred thousand pounds of cotton were spun into thread - all by hand - in 1765.  Twenty years later, sixteen million pounds were spun, by machine, and the price of cotton cloth had dropped from the caviar range to the mere smoked salmon bracket.<br /><br />That illustrated the effect of the power loom on the spinning of cotton, but later in the same chapter, Gordon comes up with another statistic and description to describe how Eli Whitney's cotton gin transformed the cotton industry still further.  \\"Whitney's machine could be built in an hour or so by any competent carpenter and worked by a single laborer, increasing his productivity fully fifty times.  In a stroke, Whitney had reduced the labor cost of ginning from the dominant component in the cost of cotton cloth to a mere triviality.  And the cost of cotton cloth dropped, as a result, from the smoked salmon range to the fish and chips bracket.\\"<br /><br />That's how of Gordon works and writes.  He includes the stories and the statistics and the conclusions in a wonderful mix that delights, entertains, and informs.<br /><br />If you are a businessperson, this book is for you because you will learn about how others before you have faced some of the same challenges that you face.  You'll learn about how the economic wheel tends to revolve and good times follow bad, and times of great change follow times of stagnation.  You'll be a better and more effective businessperson after reading this book.<br /><br />This book is also for you if you think business is boring.  Those of us who are in business know that it's endlessly fascinating and filled with things to learn, as well as with opportunities for profit.  But the media as a whole tend to reduce business to the stock market and ignore the true human drama of what goes on.  They miss some of the best stories, because they start from the assumption that the most interesting things in the world have to do with almost anything but business.<br /><br />That's a point that Gordon makes at some length in the chapter called, \\"No Respect.\\"  It opens with this line,  \\"If Rodney Dangerfield weren't a comedian, he would probably be an executive.  Executives don't get any respect, either.\\"<br /><br />From there, Gordon goes on to point out that many famous inventors were not the people responsible for the changes in society brought about by their inventions. Alexander Graham Bell, invented the telephone, and has a giant entry in the Encyclopedia Britannica. But it washis father-in-law, Gardiner Greene Hubbart, who put together the system that became A T & T; and, not only made a lot of money for himself and Bell, but also changed the shape of the country.<br /><br />In that example and dozens of others throughout this book, Gordon shows us the romance that goes with the business of America.s line,  \\"If Rodney Dangerfield weren't a comedian, he would probably be an executive.

The Platinum Rule:  \\"Do unto others as they prefer to be done unto,\\" is an excellent rule for communicating with people in all kinds of environments.<br /><br />Tony Alessandra and Michael O'Connor have written an excellent book similar to lots of other books that are out there.  All the books and systems are based on the same Jungian Psychology of Personality Types.<br /><br />You'll hear these different systems under a variety of names.  You'll hear them as personality types or social styles or other things.<br /><br />The most complex and best document of all of these is the Myers Briggs Type Inventory.  It uses four dimensions to create sixteen basic personality types.  Most of the social style systems are a bit simpler.  They use two dimensions to create four personality types.<br /><br />In my supervisory training and in using this material myself, I found that the MBTI is much more effective and nuanced in terms of analysis.  But, I found that the social style systems are more likely to be used, and used effectively, when communicating in a social or business setting.<br /><br />Essentially, you learn two things from any of these systems.  You learn, first of all, how you tend to communicate, and what you value.  Do you communicate directly or indirectly?  Are you focused on the mission to be accomplished or on the relationship with the person you're communicating with?<br /><br />The basic social style structure then shows you how to figure out what styles other people may use and a few other important things.  You can learn how what you do can be very ineffective with some other people.  And, you can use some things you can do differently to make your communication more effective.<br /><br />There is a third advantage to this material if you are applying it in a work group where everybody uses the same material.  That advantage is that this material will give you a common language for describing many types of communications in supervisory situations.<br /><br />All of that is true for all the material that's out there on social styles.  I think this is the best book, though.<br /><br />What Alessandra and O'Connor have done that is different from others is they have given you the ability to use a very simple and rough-cut method and then also the ability to go deeper into more variance of style.  It's almost like getting the best of the more complex instruments in with the simpler ones.<br /><br />I've been using varieties of this material for almost thirty years in supervisory skills training.  I've found that just about all of the reputable systems are first rate.  But, you should buy this book if you want one solid insight and reference source to help you do more effective communicating.hat advantage is that this material will give you a common language for describing many types of communications in supervisory situations.  <br /> <br />All of that is true for all the material that's out there on social styles.

The subject is leadership.  It's not intended to be a biography or a review of the events of Giuliani's mayoral tenure or the events of September 11.  The book, which was obviously started before Giuliani left office, is supposed to be about leadership, and it<br /><br />is.<br /><br />After a brief opening where Mr. Giuliani tells us why he's writing the book, we move to a discussion of the impact of September 11.  No matter how the book was originally designed, this is an appropriate place to begin.<br /><br />From there we go to the bulk of the book, which is composed of a series of fourteen chapters, each of which lays out a particular leadership point or belief.  There's a lot here that's valuable and<br /><br />worthwhile.<br /><br />The book is exceptionally well written.  Sections move easily from a discourse of principles to examples from Giuliani's life and career and back again.<br /><br />If you come to this book looking for insights into leadership, you will definitely find them.  They're scattered throughout the book and more a part of individual insights than they are of some kind of overall plan, pattern, or philosophy.  That seems odd to me, because one of the things that Giuliani was best at as mayor and which he described superbly in this book, is the use of control systems and accountability to assure good performance.<br /><br />And you will certainly hear about good performance.  You will also get insight into the person.  You will get excellent stories about his experience of September 11, of his youth, and of his success.  You won't get much about anything that wasn't a success.<br /><br />No one can have as long a career as Rudolph Giuliani or occupy as often-embattled a position as the Mayor of New York without making a few bad choices and having things come out wrong.  Giuliani certainly did.  They're not in this book, though.<br /><br />For example, you'll hear a great deal about the woman he is now spending his life with. But there's very little about the kinds of decisions he made that led to an almost soap opera atmosphere surrounding his messy divorce.<br /><br />You'll hear plenty about his success in reducing the crime statistics in New York.  You won't hear about what went on - if anything - with education, even though that was supposed to be an area of concentration in his second term.<br /><br />You'll be reminded several times that he and his administration thought about and researched and planned for disasters and were, therefore, better prepared to handle September 11 than they might have been otherwise.  You won't hear how there were no joint city-wide operations to test many of these plans, nor will you hear some of the criticisms that have been voiced in other places about issues of coordination and technology.<br /><br />What that means is that as good as the book is, after awhile you start to ask yourself a question.  \\"What's the rest of this story?  What's the other side?\\"<br /><br />In the end, that's what left me vaguely dissatisfied with the book and unwilling to give it a complete, unqualified, strong buy recommendation.  You'll get part of the story here, and what you'll get is good, valuable, and may be helpful.  But you won't get the whole story.ly did.

I read and re-read my hardbound copy, dipping into it again and again for more than three decades until that copy finally fell apart two years ago, and I had to buy another copy.  Even though I've read it - cover to cover - several times and dipped into it, literally, hundreds of times, I always find something valuable.<br /><br />Drucker is one of the most lucid and insightful writers there is.  In the Effective Executive, he applies those skills to analyzing the job of anyone who has to do knowledge work.  In other words, this isn't for the \\"executive\\" in the classic sense.  If thinking is a large part of what you do, this is a good book for you.  The main points are staggeringly simple.  Know thy time.  What can I contribute?  Making strength productive.  First things first.  Making effective decisions.<br /><br />For each key point, Drucker gives you, in his usual straightforward way, both examples and ideas.  This<br /><br />is the book that first taught me to schedule my work in ninety-minute blocks.  It's the one that taught me not only about the importance of setting priorities, but how to do it.  It's a book that taught me the basics<br /><br />of decision making, but also that the most important thing about decision making is to have a method for it.<br /><br />I recommend this to all my students in supervision, management, and leadership classes.  I recommend it to you, even if you are not bound for a desert island.	2005-02-27

Thirty years ago, paying attention to time management would do the same.  Today, looking at workflow gives us the next step in the evolution of effectiveness.<br /><br />The book, Getting Things Done, is divided into three parts.  The first is called \\"The Art of Getting Things Done.\\"  This is where the author, David Allen, lays out the basics of mastering workflow and getting projects creatively underway.<br /><br />The key to getting control of your life is mastering that workflow.  Once stuff shows up in your \\"inbox,\\" what do you do with it?  Allen gives you a straightforward way to process what's in your \\"inbox\\" without getting bogged down.<br /><br />His key insight is to concentrate on the next necessary action for any project you might be working on.  That's especially powerful.  Procrastination often comes from not knowing what the next action to take should be.  Using the action list that Allen recommends, you should cut down your procrastination significantly.<br /><br />I should note here that action in Allen's sense doesn't mean \\"deciding\\" or any other such activity, unless it results in something visible.  That keeps us out of the action list that are filled with things where you start to prepare to begin to get ready to do things, and moves you right on to the doing itself.<br /><br />Allen covers this material in twenty-five pages, and it is the core and key value of this book.  If you buy the book for the workflow system and the insights that Allen has into it, you'll get more than your money's worth.<br /><br />Alas, on page fifty-four in my edition, Allen starts talking about getting projects creatively underway.  I found this material to be pretty garden-variety stuff.  No big insights.  In fact, it suffers from what lots of other material on planning suffers from, the idea that planning is a straight-through process without an iterative looping around as you would adjust goals and plans.<br /><br />Once the early material on project management wraps up Part One, you could move on to Part Two.  Part Two is about Practicing Stress-free Productivity.  Actually, it's not about that at all.  What it is about, in one hundred plus pages, is how to get this entire system started.  We get recommendations down to the file folder level.  This may be helpful to you.  I found it useless padding in the book.<br /><br />At the end of this section, he loops back to the workflow diagram that he'd covered a hundred pages earlier.<br /><br />Part Three takes us back to the Power of Key Principles, and it's worth reading as a review, as well for several specific tips that are embedded in it.<br /><br />Now, it may seem from my comments just above, that I don't think this book is worth the money.  That would be inaccurate.  This is simply one of the best, and most helpful books, I've ever read on organizing.  For me, the value was in the workflow process and the things around it.  I didn't need the stuff on Getting Started, and I didn't like the stuff on Project Planning.<br /><br />We each come to books like this with different backgrounds and needs, and so if your needs are different than mine, you may find other pieces of this book valuable.  One thing I'm sure of - if you buy the book, you'll find value in it.as you would adjust goals and plans.<br /><br />Once the early material on project management wraps up Part One, you could move on to Part Two.

He and consultant, Ram Charan, have written two books based on his experience and his effectiveness.  The first book was Execution:  The Art of Getting Things Done.  I believe that for most folks, especially in small to mid-size businesses, Confronting Reality is a more effective book.  As a consultant and a leadership trainer, I found that confronting reality is one of the things that is very hard to get people to do.  As human beings, we seem to be programmed to see the world the way we want it, rather than the way it is.  The result is that we need to have some kind of a method for determining what reality is.<br /><br />That's worth doing, because the most effective executives that I have known are those who start with a clear idea of the situation they're facing.  They are relentless in pursuing a clear picture of the reality they face, so that they can develop plans for dealing with it and changing it.<br /><br />In fact, that's the basis for almost all effective strategic planning programs.  You start by determining your current situation, the current state of affairs.  From there you look at the end state, the place you want to go, and you develop plans for getting from here to there.  That, essentially, is what confronting reality is about.<br /><br />The book begins with three excellent chapters.  \\"When Reality Bites\\" lays out the case for a systematic way of confronting reality and taking action.  It uses two examples.  One of those, the positive one, is the example of Lou Gerstner when he was the CEO of IBM.  In fact, Gerstner's own book, Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?, is an excellent companion to this book.<br /><br />Chapter Two gives a description of why the world is changing.  It's a clear and cogent look at many of the forces at work in the world.  This will be especially valuable for you if you are in a large company.  Many smaller company folks will find this fun to read, but not all that helpful.<br /><br />Chapter Three is about re-defining the basics of management.  In this chapter, the authors walk through a quick tour of changing management and leadership thinking and fads.<br /><br />From Chapter Four on, the book is built around the description that Bossidy and Charan give of the business model.  Now, if you've been reading anything since the start of the Doc Com boom, you've come across that term before.  This is the only place I've ever seen where it is defined in a way that is usable<br /><br />In my experience, when most folks talk about a business model, what they really mean is a business plan.  Bossidy and Charan talk about a business model in the classic sense of a model, a small-scale or thought version of reality that you can actually see work.<br /><br />Their business model structure has three parts.  Part one is internal factors.  Another part is external factors, the marketplace, if you will.  And the third part is financial factors.<br /><br />That alone might be worth the price of admission, because it is an excellent quick way to get a handle on how a business works and what kinds of things might need to be changed.  But there's another point buried here that my work as a consultant tells me is critically important.<br /><br />When I was a young man, just starting out in management, I had taken a lot of courses in Business Planning and Strategic Planning.  What I learned was that you gathered the information, drew up the plan, and then executed it -- three big, discreet steps.  Reality was very different.<br /><br />I found, first of all, that most of the time planning was not quite that cut and dried.  We started with<br /><br />some ideas, we picked up more information, and those caused us to change some ideas and so on and so on.<br /><br />What Bossidy and Charan talk about that is critical is the iterative process of looking at the three parts of the business model and how they interact.  They outline, rightly, a process that is iterative and messy, rather than step by step and neat.  In other words, they lay out a process the way it is likely to work in your business.<br /><br />In my judgment, the business model and the description of how to use it, are worth the price of the book.  That's a good thing, because examples of the model, and so forth, make up the bulk of the text.<br /><br />There is also material about looking around corners and making predictions and conditioning the culture for reality.  Personally, I didn't find those that helpful.<br /><br />In part, that's because I think the Predictions Chapter is fairly weak, and the Culture Chapter is far more attuned to big companies than to the smaller ones that I work with.<br /><br />I think this book is worth buying and reading if you want an overview of how the business environment has changed in the last several years, and a simple and adaptable method for thinking about your business.  If you want a working idea of what a business model is, this book is good for that, as well.how they interact.

One reason for that is that it is an excellent overview of leadership in organizations and how you can do it yourself.<br /><br />The book's structure follows its basic recommendations.  The authors recommend five fundamental practices, each of which has two commandments, for a total of ten.  In general, these are both straightforward and insightful.  \\"Challenge the Process\\" talks about searching for opportunities, experimenting, and taking risks.  \\"Modeling the Way\\" talks about setting the example and planning small wins.  There is also material on \\"Enabling Others to Act.\\"<br /><br />Then there are a couple of weaker sections.  Sections on inspiring and encouraging simply are too fluffy and lack the support that is given to other points.<br /><br />Even having said that, this is a book that's worth reading if you are responsible for leadership in an organization of any size.  The reason is the way the book came together.<br /><br />The authors used two different kinds of research to develop their recommendations.  They looked at over five hundred leaders, but they looked at them in a particular way.<br /><br />In each case, they had asked the leader to talk about his or her actions as a leader when they were doing excellent work.  In other words, they looked for excellent examples of leadership and tried to draw lessons from them.<br /><br />They also went to the other side and talked to followers about what they wanted in leaders.  When they put those two kinds of research together, you get recommendations that are both practical and, for the most part, behavioral.<br /><br />Warren Bennis' recent book, Geeks and Geezers, is an excellent companion for this book.  In that book, Bennis talks about crucibles of leadership or experiences, which provide intense stress and learning of leadership that form leadership values.<br /><br />On the plus side this is good, practical, behavioral and helpful if you're responsible for a group of any kind or size.  On the downside, some of the language can be fuzzy and simplistic, and some of the concepts, like \\"Encourage the Heart\\" sounds just a tad too New Age for my taste.ical, behavioral and helpful if you're responsible for a group of any kind or size.

If you're involved with putting together marketing campaigns, or making sales calls, or writing advertisements, or just getting your kids to clean their rooms, this is a book you must read.<br /><br />Cialdini is Regents Professor of Psychology at Arizona State University.  Normally, that would mean that he would write like an academic and be interested in the arcane debates of his specialty.  Fortunately for us, neither of those is true.<br /><br />Dr. Cialdini writes persuasively (of course) and clearly about the practical aspects of persuasion.  His books on this subject have sold more than a quarter of a million copies under slightly different titles and over several editions.  They will all help you persuade people more effectively.<br /><br />Cialdini lays out basic tools of influence.  Actually, he calls them \\"weapons\\" of influence, but I like the term \\"tools\\" better.  The tools are:  Reciprocation; Commitment and Consistency; Social Proof; Liking; Authority; and Scarcity.<br /><br />The book deals with each of these in turn.  Cialdini offers engaging examples and practical applications for what you're reading.<br /><br />This is simply the very best book there is on the subject by the very best expert on the subject.  You'll enjoy the book and you'll improve your ability to persuade people if you follow Cialdini's suggestions.  You'll also be able to spot ways that you are being influenced.  Either of those outcomes is reason enough to make this book a must-read.	2005-02-16

They don't execute.  The fact is that the greatest strategy in the world is useless if the company or other organization can't make it work.  Strategy without execution is impotent.<br /><br />So, this is a book about execution.  Well, not exactly.  Actually, it's a book about the structural processes that lead to executing strategy effectively.  The three processes, as identified by the authors, are the people process, the strategy process, and the operations process.<br /><br />They're all important and you have to get them all to work and to work together.  The authors should know how to do this.  Larry Bossidy is one of the world's most successful and effective executives.  He was effective at General Electric, at Allied Signal, and at Honeywell.  Ram Charan is a consultant who has worked with lots of companies for a number of years and been successful there.<br /><br />Not only do they know what they're talking about,  they convey their knowledge well.  The organization of the book helps them get the message across.  The contents are divided into three parts:  Why Execution is Needed; The Building Blocks of Execution; and the Three Core Processes of Execution.  Each of those sections includes chapters which are well laid out and thoughtfully developed.<br /><br />Also, throughout the book, the two authors, Bossidy and Charan, put in short pieces in the first person.  I found these particularly helpful, because they gave me insight into the basic text, and they also gave me the flavor and style of the way these men think.<br /><br />A big plus for the book - and something that makes it easy reading - is the selection of Charles Burke as writer and editor.  Burke was an excellent editor and writer when he was at Fortune, and he brings those skills to the book.<br /><br />If this book has a weakness, it's the way examples are presented.  Since both Bossidy and Charan don't necessarily want to name names, we get a lot of descriptions of people without knowing exactly who they are.  That means that you have to put up with a lot of  \\"X's\\" and \\"Y's\\" and descriptions of people as, \\"A marketing executive for a mid-size chemical company.\\"<br /><br />Personally, I found that very irritating, but not irritating enough to get me to stop reading.  This is a book that will help you get your culture, your strategy, your people processes, and your operations in order. You can read it in a couple of different ways.<br /><br />You can read this book straight through from front to back.  This will give you the material as a logically developed argument.<br /><br />If you're a working manager you may not want to take the time to read that way, but you can get lots of value from this book by finding a section of interest and then scanning the subtopics to help you decide where to start reading.<br /><br />For example, in the chapter on getting the right folks in the right jobs you'll find a major subhead called \\"What kind of people are you looking for?\\"  Scan the subheads under that and you'll find \\"They energize people,\\" \\"They're decisive on tough issues,\\" \\"They get things done through others,\\" and \\"They follow through.\\"  None of these subheads show up in the table of contents, so you've got to start your browsing in the text itself.<br /><br />Don't worry if you aren't running a business as big as Honeywell.  This is a good book for managers in far smaller organizations.  The advice is solid, practical and easy to understand and adapt.<br /><br />This book gets a solid buy recommendation.

It's about one of the most fascinating and effective and least written-about business executives in the world, Dee Hock.<br /><br />Hock is the founder and CEO Emeritus of Visa.  Visa is an organizational form unlike anything anyone had ever seen or, for that matter since.  It combined the efforts of organizations that were normally at each other's competitive throats.  But that's not all.<br /><br />In the process of getting Visa to work, Hock and the other folks that he worked with, also managed to create the payment system that is Visa.  To realize how big an achievement this is, consider the fact that the check-clearing system in the Federal Reserve still does not work with a fraction of the efficiency of the Visa-approval and payment-clearing process.<br /><br />I'd known about Dee Hock for years, and I was fascinated by him and by the process that must have gone into establishing, actually inventing, Visa.  I snatched up this book when it came out hoping that it would contain the story of Hock and the Visa adventure.  It did.  That story is compelling and well written.<br /><br />But there's more to this book than that story, and the \\"more\\" includes lots of bits of value and many bits of frustration.<br /><br />Take the title.  Birth of the what Age?  \\"Chaordic.\\"  Try looking that up in the dictionary.  It's not there.  Do we need a brand-new word to describe what Hock is describing?  Maybe, but I'm not sure.<br /><br />I'm quite sure I don't need some of the other strange things that he does with language in the book.  There is, for example, \\"Thee Ancient One.\\"  That turns out to be a tractor.  Then there's \\"old monkey mind.\\"<br /><br />Old monkey mind is the term that Hock uses in several different ways throughout the book.  Sometimes it's used to refer to logical, linear, left side of the brain.  Sometimes it's used to refer to old thinking patterns.  Sometimes it seems to be a kind of alter ego for Hock with whom he has conversations.<br /><br />That kind of language is cute but it's more appropriate to a book of whimsy.  Here it gets in the way of understanding.  And there's a lot here to understand.<br /><br />Whatever else Dee Hock is, he is certainly one of the most fascinating intellects that I've come across.  He's clearly a man of principle.  He's had an amazing life, starting from poverty, rising to heights of business where he created one of the great financial institutions in the history of the planet.  Then he walked away from that achievement with less ongoing compensation than Jack Welch's apartment rentals. Hock's mind is supple and rich and dips into sources that span time and geography and cultures.<br /><br />Hock's life and the story of Visa are fascinating, and it pulls us along, but there's real meat in his observations about organizations and how they work and how they ought to work.  There are penetrating insights into the ways that organizations have an impact on the Planet, on the economy, and on individual lives.  There are insights and observations about what it means to be human.<br /><br />In the end, I think this is really two books.  One book is a story that goes from start to finish.  It's the story of Dee Hock.  It's the story of Visa.  It's a fascinating story, filled with lessons and examples. It's worth buying the book that's between the cover for.<br /><br />Then there's the other book that is a collection of bits of observation and thought.  They're not presented in a coherent way, just plopped down into the story in separate chapters throughout the book.  This is a book with less organization and more random insights.  It, too, is interesting and worth the price of the book.<br /><br />In the end, you can get two books - both wonderful, for the price of one.kind of alter ego for Hock with whom he has conversations.   <br /> <br />That kind of language is cute but it's more appropriate to a book of whimsy.

US	52750742	R22FX14ZUXG9C7	0465014542	309104341	Creating Minds: An Anatomy of Creativity as Seen Through the Lives of Freud, Einstein, Picasso, Stravinsky, Eliot, Graham, and Gandhi	Books	4	17	18	N	N	Great Stories, Picked to Fit Gardner's Schema	Howard Gardner has changed the way we think about intelligence.  His seminal book, Frames of Mind, introduced the idea that the correct question we should be asking is not, \\"How smart am I?\\" but rather \\"How am I smart?\\"<br /><br />It was Gardner who first came up with the idea that there are different kinds of intelligence, and that we have differing gifts in all of them.  In Creating Minds, he goes beyond the basic concept that he laid out in<br /><br />Frames of Mind, by looking at creativity through the lens of these multiple intelligences.<br /><br />What he tries to do is to illuminate how specific creative geniuses in different fields used different intelligences.  On the whole, the book works.<br /><br />Gardner gives us, in brief, the lives of Sigmund Freud, Albert Einstein, Pablo Picasso, Igor Stravinsky,<br /><br />T. S. Eliot, Martha Graham, and Mahatma Ghandi.  In each biography, he talks about their particular gifts, especially their \\"intelligence,\\" using his own framework.  This works very well with some of his subject and not so well with others.<br /><br />It's easy to get a handle on spatial intelligence with Picasso, and musical intelligence with Stravinsky, and linguistic intelligence with Eliot.  It's easy to understand how a dancer like Martha Graham has bodily or physical intelligence.  But when we move into some other domains, especially the social, things get a bit murky.<br /><br />The chapter on Ghandi seems to me to be in the book because it was necessary to complete the range of intelligences that Gardner had described.  Part of the problem may be that political creators have to mobilize other human beings and creativity in that domain is sometimes is harder to judge and define than, for example, the ability to conceptualize a sculpture or a set of mathematical equations.<br /><br />I also wish that Gardner had included some comparisons of other contemporaries in the same field in some of his stories.  I would like, for example, to have seen Gandhi set against Hitler.  Both were effective at mobilizing people, but they pursued very different ends.  Or, perhaps we could have set Gandhi against Franklin Roosevelt or Martin Luther King, Jr.<br /><br />The biggest problem I had with the book, though, was Gardner's definition of creation as lifetime achievement.  I'm not sure I'm comfortable, with the idea that the most creative people are the people who work in the same field throughout a lifetime, and make major contributions there throughout that lifetime. That certainly is one kind of creativity and it's well represented and analyzed in this book.<br /><br />We learn, for example, that most of the creative people studied by Gardner seem to move through their creative life in stages.  They spend a decade or so mastering their domain and then producing great work.  Then there's another decade or so spent mastering a new aspect of the domain, followed by more creative output.<br /><br />We also learn about the need for a circle of people around the creative person who provide both support and stimulation.  Many times these are the unsung heroes of the genius' career.<br /><br />There are some things missing, though.  There's no discussion of folks who produce creative work in different fields.<br /><br />There's a good deal to be said for the idea that someone - such as Linus Pauling, recipient of two Nobel Prizes - who changes fields and makes major contributions in more than one field, is more creative than a person who stays in a single field.  There's something to be said for the argument that a person who is effective in many areas, but not of genius caliber in one, is as creative as the one-field genius.<br /><br />Those kinds of reservations lead me to suggest that this is a much more compelling book as biography than it is as psychology.  You can, if you choose, forget all of the material about what constitutes creativity and the reference to the multiple intelligences and read each of the maincharacters' sketches as a short biography and come away with an insight into that person and his or her creative life that you would not have otherwise.<br /><br />This is a good and illuminating read.  It will stretch your mind and your understanding.gences and read each of the main characters' sketches as a short biography and come away with an insight into that person and his or her creative life that you would not have otherwise. <br /> <br />This is a good and illuminating read.

They chose the companies they would study based on specific, detailed criteria.<br /><br />They wanted to study companies that had been premier institutions in their industries and widely admired while they made an imprint on the world around them.  They wanted their companies to have multiple generations of chief executives and to have gone through multiple product or service lifecycles. And they wanted the companies to have been around for a long time - founded before 1950.<br /><br />They compared each of their visionary companies with another company that was not a premier visionary company.  Many of the comparison companies were solid performers.  They were good companies, but not great companies.  That's one of the great things about the book.  You can see the distinction between good performance and great performance.<br /><br />Another thing that makes the book great is the extensive research.  The project took six years, and the authors and their research team dug into critical issues and came up with fascinating insights and comparisons.<br /><br />Read this book and you will learn about the characteristics of great companies that have an impact on the world around them.  The discussions will enrich your understanding of what makes a great company.  This will be especially valuable to you if you're in the process of building a company that you want to be great.<br /><br />That's the great part, the hero part.  What about the flaws?<br /><br />The first flaw is that essentially performance for each of these companies is equated with market performance.  There are lots of things the authors could have used, such as return on assets, for example.  But share price is easy to track over time and is used as a surrogate for greatness.  I'm not sure that that's the best criterion.<br /><br />What you are actually reading about is a selection of excellent, visionary companies that were perceived as good investments by the market.  This \\"perception\\" issue is not addressed in the book.<br /><br />The second flaw is more important.  While this book tells you marvelous things about companies that are admittedly great and about some of the things that make for greatness in companies, and while it mixes statistical data with telling anecdotes, it falls short in one critical area.  The book doesn't tell you anything about how to achieve greatness.<br /><br />In other words, it describes what greatness might be and it gives you some examples of companies who have achieved it, but the book ultimately left me with the nagging desire that the authors would have given me some \\"how to.\\"  As far as you can tell from reading the book, these companies were always great.<br /><br />That may not be a problem for you if you're just starting a company.  You've got a clean slate to start from.  But if you're guiding an already-established company, or a part of it, I think you'll wish for a few examples of companies that became great after performing at some lesser level.<br /><br />That's the bottom line in my recommendation.  If you're looking for a book that describes greatness and where you'll pick up a wealth of ideas and good historical knowledge about great companies, buy this book.  If, on the other hand, what you want is a book that describes in some detail how to achieve that greatness, this may not be the book for you.asy to track over time and is used as a surrogate for greatness.

That's why you should consider buying the book.  Without an understanding of the terminology that Michael Porter developed originally in Competitive Strategy, you won't be able to follow many of the arguments that other people use when they're talking about the subject.<br /><br />When you get past that, you need to ask yourself your primary reason for reading any book on strategy.  If you're looking for a \\"how-to\\" book, one with ideas that you can implement reasonably quickly, this is not the book for you.  This is written by a professor and the presentation is academic.  That doesn't make the insights any less valuable, but often it makes them harder to unearth.<br /><br />Here's my recommendation.  You should be familiar enough with Porter's basic methods and terminology to recognize and understand them in other books, articles, and discussions.  If you don't have that knowledge now, buy this book and develop that understanding.<br /><br />If you already have a basic knowledge of some of Porter's terminology and concepts, then this book will give you an excellent structural underpinning to take to the other books about strategy.  But, if you're looking for something that you can dip into quickly to work on your company's strategic plan, find something a little less dense and academic.	2005-01-31

Jim Collins can make that claim.<br /><br />The first one, co-authored with Jerry Porras was Built to Last:  Successful Habits of Visionary Companies.  In that book, the authors took a look at companies who'd had long-term success , drew some conclusions about what they had in common and compared them with other companies who were good, but not great.<br /><br />That was good.  It just wasn't enough.  Built to Last didn't tell us how companies moved from mediocrity to greatness.  That's what Collins chose to study and to write about in his second book, Good to Great.<br /><br />In both books, Collins' research follows a strict regimen, using the public record, to identify companies that meet specific criteria.  For this book, those criteria help Collins identify eleven companies made that switch from mediocrity to greatness.<br /><br />The ultimate measure of mediocrity and stunning success is stock price.  Each company that Collins studied went along for years with ho-hum stock performance.  Then, all of a sudden, the curve shot upward.  The question Collins asks for us is: \\"What did they do that made such a dramatic and long term difference in the stock price?\\"<br /><br />With the list of companies established, Collins and his research team start looking at the histories of the companies, searching for clues about what the companies did to generate the change in their performance.  The major tool here is coverage in the business press.<br /><br />This gives us two very different kinds of research.  The first phase, where companies are identified based on specific criteria that are solid and easy to verify.  Stock price is the measure.  The price was this and then it shot up to that.  You might join me in wishing another measure of success had been used, but there it is.<br /><br />The second phase is informed interpretation.  The research involved reading everything the team could find about the key companies and then talking about what they found.  Patterns began to emerge.  Those patterns turned into \\"findings.\\"  Most of them make sense to me.<br /><br />For example,  \\"A Culture of Discipline\\" and  \\"The Hedgehog Concept\\" make sense based on  his team's analysis but they also makes sense to me based on my experience, working with companies for over thirty years.<br /><br />A couple of the findings seem to owe as much to the fads of the day as they do to research.  The material on technology accelerators, for example, probably wouldn't have been in the book if the book had been written in 1981.  Today, though, if you write a book about business, technology is one of the lenses you look through.<br /><br />Then there is Collins' material on Level Five Leadership.  This seems like the part of the book where the consultant comes up with some \\"system\\" upon which to base workshops, licensed training and other such profit builders. This material is mostly solid, but nothing radically different from most of writing about good leadership.  The one exception is also the part I have a problem with.<br /><br />Collins identifies \\"humility\\" as a characteristic of a Level Five Leader.  I don't think his data support that.  The people he describes seem no more or less humble than any other group of high achievers.  Where they differ from many of today's most celebrated CEOs is that they clearly are more concerned with how their company does, than they are with how they look on the cover of Business Week.  I would have been more comfortable if he'd described the CEOs of his eleven companies as \\"results-focused\\" or \\"company-focused\\" and then compared them to star-type CEOs.<br /><br />These are small nits to pick on an excellent work.

Many of them are simply the limits of our experience.  Great books help us transcend those boundaries.  By that test, Seabiscuit is a great book and Laura Hillenbrand is a great writer.<br />The story that she tells, by now, is well known.  We have the short, funny looking horse whose potential is recognized and realized by an unlikely trio of men, each of whom is distinct and each of whom is damaged in some way.<br />Tom Smith is the silent cowboy watching the world he loved slip away into history, holding on by doing the one thing he can do well-work with horses.  Red Pollard is the jockey who's not having a lot of success.  He's a little too big and a little too battered.  Charles Howard is the successful businessman who had lost a son.<br />The trio, with occasional help from jockey George Woolf, rides with Seabiscuit to heights of popularity and interest that exceed even the President.  Along the way there is triumph and despair, winning and losing, good luck and bad, all the stuff of a gripping yarn.  Along the way you learn a lot, too.<br />You learn about horse racing.  Laura Hillenbrand knows a lot about horses and horse racing, but she wears that knowledge lightly.  If you, like me, knew next to nothing about horses and racing before picking up this book, by the end you will know a lot more.  And you will have learned it painlessly.<br />Hillenbrand is exceptional at wrapping her teaching in stories.  She explains and defines only as much as necessary and lets the stories do the rest.  She can convey technical details without damaging the pace or passion of the story.<br />Like most good true stories this one has lots of lessons, but they're yours to fashion.  There are no &quot;author's message&quot; passages that tell you what the lesson should be.  But there are stories that grip you and pull you forward.<br />This is more than just a book that will keep you up reading late into the night.  It is a book that is so engaging and powerful that when it is over, you will not want it to end.  When the Most Beautiful Woman in the World finished the book, at about 2 AM, she kept reading all the way through the acknowledgements in their tiny type until there was absolutely no more she could read.so engaging and powerful that when it is over, you will not want it to end.

You'll like this book if you're responsible for the merchandising in a retail store anywhere. You'll also like this book if you're fascinated by human beings and how they act in their natural habitat.<br />Why We Buy is as much an anthropological study as it is a business book.  Paco Underhill describes what the title implies:  Why We Buy.  He looks at all of the elements that go into merchandising, such as the signage in a store, the width of the aisles, waiting times, and more.<br />That might be enough, but he also will give you insights into different kinds of shoppers and the differences in the ways that men and women - as well as adults and children - shop.  Along the way, you'll pick up interesting tidbits, such as the distinction between marketing and merchandising.<br />To Underhill, marketing is increasing the number of people who come to the door with interest, while merchandising is everything you do after that and leads to selling on the floor.  He has insights to share, based on his research, about both.<br />This is an excellent book except for one part.  The section on the Internet and Web are simply weak.  They show a lack of understanding of the Web as a retail medium and  of how the Web, catalog operations and physical stores will each function in the Digital Age.<br />It seems to me like this section was inserted because &quot;there has to be something about the Web.&quot;  I would have preferred that Underhill either lavish the kind of attention and effort on Web selling that he so obviously has spent on physical stores, or had left the Net material out of this book all together.<br />Even with that problem, this is an excellent book.  If you're responsible for a retail store, this book is a \\"must read.\\"  If you're a customer, you may want to recommend it to the owners of stores where you shop especially the ones where you love the merchandise, but hate the shopping experience.	2003-08-01

I've studied the craft and I have a shelf full of books on writing.  This book is one of the best.<br />The subtitle of the book is telling.  King called this \\"a Memoir of the Craft.\\"  He is an excellent memoirist.<br />The memoir part is fascinating.  King tells us about his life and it's quite an interesting one.  He talks about his youth, about meeting his wife, about his early years and his writing, about his alcoholism, about his near-fatal accident, all enriched with a myriad of details.  This is the stuff of which of which good memoirs are made.<br />Throughout the book, King throws off little droplets of observation about writing and the writer's life.  For example, \\"Writing is a lonely job.  Having someone who believes in you makes a lot of difference.  They don't have to make speeches.  Just believing is usually enough.\\"<br />That line comes amidst the discussion of meeting his wife and what she's meant to him.  As someone who's been in relationships that were both helpful and not, it resonated with me.  There are insights like that sprinkled throughout the book.  Some of them are about writing.  Others are not.<br />All of this is fascinating, more so because King is an excellent writer, and he conveys a lot with very little verbiage.  But the core of the book is about the craft of writing.  King leads into it in this way.  \\"What follows is everything I know about how to write good fiction.\\"<br />As the subtitle says this is about the craft of writing.  It is about craft, not art, not inspiration, not \\"being a writer.\\"  It is about craft - the work of writing and how to do it well.<br />King lets us in on this hard-core craft focus early on.  \\"There is a muse, but he's not going to come fluttering down to your writing room and scatter creative fairy dust all over your typewriter or the computer station.\\"<br />In other words, folks, King is saying that it is up to you.  Then he gets down to some practical nuts and bolts.  \\"If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others:  read a lot and write a lot.\\"<br />We find out how much King likes to write.  We find out what his rhythm is, and how he alternates periods of intense work with lying fallow.  We find out how important he thinks health and the support of his wife are.  We find out where he thinks you should work.<br />Some of this is very directive.  \\"You need the room, you need the door, and you need the determination to shut the door.  You need a concrete goal, as well.  The longer you keep to these basics, the easier the act of writing will become.  Don't wait for the Muse.\\"<br />While King is specifically directive on some things, his overall tone is quite different.  He tells you what works for him and suggests that you might want to consider it for you.<br />Here's a brief part where King talks about symbolism and theme and how he gets them into his work.  \\"Mostly I don't see stuff like that until the story's done.  Once it is, I'm able to kick back, read over what I've written, and look for underlying patterns.  If I see some (and I almost always do), I can work at bringing them out in a second, more fully realized draft of the story.\\"<br />If you are a working writer, or if you would like to be, this is a great book to read and to return to.

He'd landed a job on the staff of the Vice President of the United States, in fact.  Then he had one of those \\"Moments of Truth we've heard about.<br />The Moment of Truth came when the pressure of politics and long days caught up with him.  He had a fainting spell.  He very nearly puked on the Vice President.  And he decided that maybe there was a better way to live his life.<br />Daniel quit the organizational life to work as a freelance writer.  He got work right away.  Having the White House on your resume usually helps with things like that.<br />He worked out of his home and pretty soon he noticed that lots of friends and neighbors were starting to do the same thing.  \\"Aha!\\" he thought, \\"this could be a trend and I could write a book about it.\\"<br />And so Daniel set off on a year-long jaunt around the country.  He interviewed lots of folks.  He researched the statistics on independent workers in the US.  And he wrote his book.  The  book is a mixed bag.<br />On the upside, Pink has done a good job of pulling together a lot of different sources.  He's interviewed a lot of people and he's the kind of writer who can make the results of those interviews sing.  Those individual portraits are the strength of this book.<br />Would that he handled the statistics as well.  In the early part of the book, Pink sets his work up as a sequel to William H. Whyte's Organization Man, one written for our times. The rigor of Pink's research and his use of statistics suffer from the comparison.<br />There's a certain amount of Statistical Voodoo here.  In the quest to figure out just how many free agents there are we're presented with lots of different estimates from several different sources.  Numbers are adjusted up, down and sideways.  In the end, Pink tells us that there are about 33 million free agents in the US.<br />He divides those free agents into three groups.  There are soloists.  He's one of those.  There are microbusinesses.  Those have three or four employees.  And there are temps.  About 3 million of the 33 million are temporary workers.<br />That's one weakness of this book.  Including temps, who have different problems, prospects and possibilities takes attention away from the other free agents that Pink gushes about.<br />Did I say \\"Gushes?\\"  Yep. Sure did.  Pink thinks that being a free agent is just the neatest thing in all the world and he obviously wants you to think so, too.  For Pink free agency is the wave of the future, a New Agey kind of approach to work where everyone (except temps) wins almost all the time.<br />Nonsense.  I've been one of those free agents for a long time now.  Many of my friends qualify, too.  We make a wonderful living at it, but we've all seen enough folks start out on the free agent journey to know that lots of them end up as road kill.<br />To succeed as a free agent takes talent and discipline.  It takes a willingness to be totally responsible for your results that not everyone is willing to shoulder.  It's, very simply, not for everyone.<br />You won't hear much of this from Pink, though.  He doesn't seem to talk to many folks who've tried and failed.  And he hasn't been at it long enough himself to remember the legions of folks who call and write and email because they \\"want to do what you do\\" and then dwindle down to a precious few who are still at in years later.<br />Granted, Pink was writing while the dot-com, new economy bubble was still round and full, but that doesn't explain why he simply leaves out mention of data (decline in business startups, for example) that don't support his conclusions or people (Stanford Professor Jeffrey Pfeffer, for example) who don't agree with his assessments.<br />I found that I loved the stories and interviews, but that I was increasingly put off by the analysis.  Every time Pink moves to analyze what he found the language changes to something like a revival tent or a commercial break.  That may be designed to make his concepts easy to remember, but it just made me tired and crabby.<br />Read this book for well-written stories about people who are charting their own course as free agents.

This is the WEB design wow! book,  yet many examples are from  CD-ROM and disk applications which don't work with the same strengths and  limitations as the web.<br />Now, on to the content.  If you design a web site  based on what you get from this book you will produce a cumbersome,  lumbering, self-congratulating and user-losing-site.  The book exalts  stunning graphic design at the expense of usability and routinely calls for  the use of exotic plug-ins that simply aren't in the toolkit of most  business web users.<br />There is no attention paid to underlying information  design or nonlinear information design.  No mention is made of simple  navigational options (navigation choices at the top and bottom of pages,  site indexes).  Devices, such as splash screens which are generally  ineffective get prominent play, and techie solutions predominate.  For  example,  the book discusses simplification by using a GIF animation  instead of a Shockwave plug-in, but never discusses the appropriate places  and methods for using animations.<br />In short, this is not a book about web  design, which is about information design, functionality and graphics that  support business objectives.  Instead it's a book about graphic design and  how it might apply to the web.  The graphics are stunning, but if you're  looking for how to design an effective business web site, read the research  that's out there on what business users want, and save the bucks you'd  spend on this book.	1998-09-01
