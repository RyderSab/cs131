She could not forget the name, in fact in the way a bad jingle overstays its welcome, tinny and insistent, lodged in the neutral pathways of the brain...it was Oppenheimer, J.R.;  also the words The Father of the Atomic Bomb.\\"<br />And so begins Ann's involvement with the head of the Manhattan Project some 60 years after the detonation of the first Atomic bomb in White Sands, New Mexico in July of 1945. How, Who, Why did the three, the \\"Trinity\\" of the Atom bomb come to be among the living in Santa Fe, New Mexico in 2003 and why does Ann, a research librarian take it upon herself to care for Oppenheimer, Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard:<br />\\"The scientists were hers (Ann's), the only cause she had ever held dear. Causes had always kept her at a distance: they cried out for attention but left her numb. There were just too many of them, mostly hopeless. But now there was only one.\\"<br />Bewildered at first, and aghast at the world they helped create, Oppenheimer, Szilard, and Fermi along with Ann and her reluctant and skeptical husband, Ben convene in Los Alamos for what turns out to be a whirlwind tour of the blast sites in Los Alamos and Nagasaki, the Marshall Islands and ultimately to Washington D.C. leading a caravan of fundamentalist Christians who look upon Oppenheimer as the Messiah: \\"...more than any of it, Oppenheimer murmured, what astounds me is the blindness of you people now. A civilization that is blind to itself. I mean blind. In my day there was ignorance too: ignorance is timeless. But at least we were ashamed of it.\\"<br />The Atomic bomb has several fathers, most of them dead for decades: Nobel-winning Enrico Fermi died in '54, Leo Szilard, who persuaded Einstein to sign a letter to FDR stressing the weapon's necessity, joined him a decade later--three years before cancer claimed pork-pie hat wearing, chain-smoking Manhattan Project director Robert Oppenheimer. Only Edward Teller made it into the new Millennium.<br />Millet is after something here and what that is I am not fully sure. But when someone can write a paragraph like this, clarity and purpose almost become irrelevant: \\"At certain moments of shock or stupefaction it is clear, she thought, that doing anything is a waste of time, that effort itself is a waste. Doing something appears more wasteful than doing nothing, while only doing nothing seems safe. This may be because something is always, at base, a distraction from nothing. Paradoxically nothing is full whereas something is often surprisingly empty; yet in nothing all things are possible, whereas in something there are limits on all sides.\\"<br />Ultimately, \\"Oh Pure and Radiant Heart\\" is not great Millet (she's already got that covered with the sublime, \\"My Happy Life\\") but it is good Millet and sometimes better than that particularly when it is being wickedly funny...which it is a lot of the time. But a Millet book always contains passages of writing that make you gasp in recognition, wonder or both and \\"Radiant Heart\\" is no exception:<br />\\"Now and then she thought she dreamed his dreams, that his dreams had been entrusted to her. Why else had she seen him before she even knew him, kneeling in the sand? Before she had even met him, when she barely heard of him, she believed she had been infused with his sentiment, as though it had bled from him.

Anyone familiar with her \\"Nobody's Girl\\" or in particular \\"Living to Tell\\" can attest to that.<br /><br />In \\"Female Trouble\\" she sets her sights on a close to her heart, I would assume subject, women: Professional women, divorced women, suicidal women, mother-earth women, young women and old women, pregnant women and the men who are fortunate enough to cross their paths.<br /><br />\\"Female Trouble\\" is a short story collection. The Short Story is probably the most difficult prose form for an author to master:a short story should be all of a piece. You should not crave for more. The author has to quickly create a world, inhabit it with interesting characters and resolve the story so that the reader is satisfied at it's resolution.<br /><br />The first story of this collection, \\"Incognito\\" is very well written and the premise is unique: a close group of three high school friends create an imaginary person, one Dawn Wrigley and use this persona as a means to act out all of their adolescent fantasies. The problem is at this story's end I craved for more, wanted loose ends tied, needed more information, felt cheated.<br /><br />On the other hand in \\"One Dog is People,\\" Nelson creates a world in which the basic premise of the story is tied up in a logical fashion with no lose ends hanging. This story also includes some of her most incisive writing: \\"A few days later I was sitting in traffic after dropping the children off at school. I relied on their disappearance every day; I could not stand such thorough neediness. And yet, as soon as they'd been swept into their buildings...I missed them. I fell under the heavy weight of guilt: how could I not be grateful? How could I not cling to what was left to me, cling and cherish?\\"<br /><br />\\"Stitches\\" is in part about the relationship between a college-age girl (Tracy) and her mother (Ellen): \\"It was unnerving to be this girl's mother. She was so forthcoming. So frankly healthy...how had she gotten this way? Ellen felt somehow excluded from the process. She (Ellen) kept secrets---not in drawers or closets or diaries, but in her heart, behind her eyes, on her lips. Tracy's admirable openness seemed not to have been inherited from Ellen, so it must have come from her father.\\"<br /><br />As with most story collections, the quality here is variable. But what does not vary is Nelson's obvious love for her characters and her unflinching desire to get at the heart of things through the use of her gorgeous, even voluptuous writing style.to be this girl's mother.

Boyle's \\"The Inner Circle\\" really helped me to fill in the visual component of Boyle's always fat and juicy prose.<br />Using the docu-fiction form, Boyle riffs on certain known facts of Kinsey's time at IU, his groundbreaking research and uses John Milk as his vehicle into that particular world that Kinsey created during his tenure at Indiana University as a professor of Biology and more importantly as a sex researcher and author.<br />Boyle writes of Milk's entrance into Kinsey-land: \\"That was the moment it all began, though I didn't realize it at the time...how could I? How could I have foreseen that a shallow, manipulative girl I hardly knew would be the motive force that was to lead me to Prok (Kinsey) and Mac (Kinsey's wife), Corcoran, Rutledge, to the desk at which I am now sitting...\\"<br />Boyle paints Kinsey as a kind of Machiavellian, all-knowing leader of his group of researchers and their families: \\"What he (Kinsey) wanted above all else was to gain the sort of intimacy that yields up confidences, and he had a true genius for it---for putting people at ease and bringing them out. Absent it, the project would have never gotten off the ground.\\"<br /> Kinsey is a warm, loving person who, as long as you do as he advises, would do anything for you. When Milk's wife, Iris has an affair with another researcher (\\"I knew why she'd done what she had...she'd had one man in her life, just one and I'd had Mac and Prok...\\") Kinsey at first is happy that she has acted out her fantasy. But when Iris decides to leave Milk and live with her lover, John... Kinsey intercedes and the whole situation is diffused. In fact in a scene very much like one between a father and son or a King and his Page, Milk goes to Kinsey not only for consolation and advice but for action and interference: \\"...I love him (Kinsey)...not in the way I love Iris...but in a deeper way, in the way a patriot loves his country or a zealot his God...\\"<br />\\"The Inner Circle\\" is an intriguing read: it is beautifully written as befits a T.C. Boyle book but it is also a strongly, no-holds-barred sexual book as befits it's subject. Don't come to Kinsey-land expecting a bland re-telling of the Alfred Kinsey life story, because you won't find it. What you will find is a passionately thoughtful novel written by one of our major contemporary novelists at the top of his form.r Circle\\" is an intriguing read: it is beautifully written as befits a T.C.

I really believed it did. My father was a different man when there was cake in the house....if he had a plate of cake in his hand I knew that I could climb up onto his lap.\\"<br /><br />We forget sometimes just how important home cooked meals mean/have meant/continue to mean to us. The food doesn't have to be great but it has to be prepared with care and of course served with love to mean something to us. What Slater has done is to take the ordinary, the everyday and elevate it to the sublime. And even though he writes about his childhood in England and the foods he fondly and not-so fondly remembers, his memories are so personal and the words to describe them are so lovingly related that they cease to only be of a particular time or place...they become universal: \\"You can't smell a hug. You can't hear a cuddle. But if you could, I reckon it would smell and sound of warm bread-and-butter pudding.\\"	2005-03-25

My pop would say, \\"'How's that weight, son?\\"' And I would say, \\"' It's holding steady, Pop...but I was sort of vain and I never bought a pair of pants over forty-two inches...so, I had a terrific hang, with a real water-balloon push.\\"<br /><br />Author Ron Mc Larty spends a lot of time describing Smithy's weight and his relationship to his expanding waistline: \\"but next to (Uncle) Count I was slim...Count was a higher order of porker. He'd crossed the line that says forget holding in your belly, forget buying smaller clothes, forget everything baby and be proud.\\"<br /><br />Smithy, thin most of his life, skinny in fact can't quite come to terms with his obesity: he feels as if he is living inside someone else's body, in fact. Yet he does nothing to stop the spread. He does everything to excess: eat, drink, and smoke. He becomes everything his sister Bethany doesn't want him to become: a sad, friendless, non-exercising, barely employed, embarrassment to the Ide family: \\"I am so disgusting. My stomach oozes over my shorts...my fat chins...(I'm an) old mutt wishing he were dead.\\"<br /><br />Then a series of devastating personal tragedies strike and Smithy jumps on his high school Raleigh bicycle and heads for parts unknown: on a journey to, unbeknownst to him, reclaim his once slim body, to reclaim his reason for living, and to reclaim his soul. He actually knows none of these things will/could happen. He's just trying once again to escape, to take the cowardly way out, to disappear.<br /><br />Mc Larty writes in spare but gorgeously fat prose, as in this episode when Smithy hits New York:\\"I gave him my dime and drank the wonderful coffee. By the time I had finished, the street was alive. And the people gave off the same feelings I got when Mrs. Fox took our fourth grade class to the Narragansett electric Company...This is what I remember.

It's about coming to the end of your rope physically and emotionally and realizing something must be done but having none of the tools emotionally to deal with it.

For Amy is basically an orphan, abandoned by her Mother and her father, Chicky who spends most of his life in prison.<br /><br />But Amy perseveres and makes a good life for herself but is haunted by the specter of her Mother: why did she leave me, where is she now?<br /><br />Besides an innate talent at writing, the aforementioned determinism and a coterie of good friends and relations, Amy has one hell of a sense of humor. Her best friend Tatty has decided to move back home after another failed marriage and has invited Amy over for dinner: \\"Tatty avoided looking at me, as she usually did at times like these, after (Tatty's parents) M and D had set sail on their nightly voyage from conviviality to stupor.\\"<br /><br />Or when Amy accompanies Tatty to what is in reality a \\"Meat Market\\": \\"Blue J's was something out of a horror movie in which aliens sucked out your essence and turned you into them. Tatty, meanwhile, patted the under curled ends of her sprayed-stiff, dark blond hairdo. Being old money allowed her to use visible hair spray. Nouveau riche blond hair had to flutter-if not fly-in a breeze.\\"<br /><br />Isaacs has cast Amy as Modern Every Woman: never able to commit to a man, wary of Men who do want to commit, scared of Men who are better looking than she: \\"But I'd never been able to stand guys, handsome or froggy, who pose questions...Where did you go to school?...in a smarmy tone, as if the real question was...Do you like to f**k standing up while eating egg salad?\\"<br /><br />But family or the lack thereof is what most ails Amy and as usual her take on it is hilarious, though bittersweet: \\"Even when it was a dysfunctional family-like Tatty's, with her father so drunk he took a nap at the table with his cheek on the roast goose-I was jealous and resentful that I wasn't part of it.\\"<br /><br />Susan Isaacs has written a hilarious book about families, relationships and the search for a Bond. And, despite all the self-help books, despite the self- help television programs, despite the abundance and variety of food, jobs available, leisure time, this Bond continually eludes most of us. What it all boils down to then, is giving and getting Love and more to the point finding someone with which to share it:  nothing earth-shaking, nothing otherworldly.<br /><br />But Isaacs has filled the pages of \\"Any place...\\" with wit, candor and gorgeous plump prose.

She is also the catalyst for all the good that takes place.<br /><br />Spragg's prose is straightforward and to the point and his story is good, particularly when he is dealing with the Mother, Jean, I think. It is obvious that Spragg loves these characters but he has a particular affinity for Jean: \\"Her (Jean's) face is bigger and brighter than she's ever shown Roy, or the sheriff or any man. It's like her mother's on fire and everybody else in the world's cold and in the dark, and her mother's there to make sure they get warm.\\"<br /><br />\\"An Unfinished Life\\" is warm and cozy and in parts like that above it burns with the fire of recognition and understanding of what makes us human. And for this it is worth your time and energy.	2004-10-28

And it is at this time that the old man (unnamed) begins a reverie of his life and in particular of the many women he has bedded and for whose affections he has paid.<br />In barely over 100 pages, Gabo manages to squeeze in a chronicle of some 500 women: not finding Love with any of them. He says:\\"Sex is the consolation for not finding enough love.\\"<br />Many will look at this novella as Gabo's attempt to write a piece that would be placed out of reach to anyone under 18 in the Public Library, alongside \\"The Tropic Of Cancer\\" or \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover.\\" And Gabo would probably think that this would be the ultimate in Coolness. But, \\"Memoria\\" is much more than this. What it is is a tribute to all women and the mysteries of all things feminine. The Old Man pays for companionship yes, but he adores these women: they are his respite from Life, all that he craves and they fulfill something much more inside of him, than can the mere act of sex.<br />The Old man calls the 14-year-old virgin Delgadilla (or the little skinny one) and he lavishes her with gifts. Delgadilla becomes the Old Man's savior and avenging angel, for it is through her innocence and love that he is reborn as a writer and as a human being.<br />\\"Memoria de mis putas tristes\\" is Gabo at his most sensual. That these encounters he details are sometimes graphic and often times brutal does not deflect the sheer beauty and majesty of the writing or of this novella in general.	2004-10-26

And in Joyce Carol Oates new novel, \\"The Falls\\" it is Gilbert, husband of Ariah who does just that. The gatekeeper of Horseshoe Falls says of the Falls' mesmerizing attraction: \\"Like we're sick of ourselves. Mankind...this is the way out.\\"<br />After the suicide of her husband, Gilbert, Ariah feels that her life is doomed. This is the 1950's in a small American town and she is looked at as the cause rather than the victim. Then she meets Dirk Burnaby, a lawyer (called \\"the Savior) involved with the victims of the Love Canal: a place filled with air that pollutes and kills and obviously represents all that is wrong with humanity...it's a wellspring of moral and physical decay. Burnaby is head-over-heels in love with Ariah and at first he only watches while she mourns: \\"He wanted to stand close behind her...and put his arms around her. He wanted for himself this ferocity of attention, this loyalty. He couldn't believe that Erskine deserved it. He hated the man, detested him, that, though dead, he should captivate the woman...So deeply in love with Ariah, he could barely see any longer; as one is unable to see one's own mirror reflection, pushed too close...\\"<br />Oates is after something different here and she uses the Love Canal disaster as a backdrop to track the Burnaby Family and her keen sense of the psychological makeup of character and her brilliant sense of social and familial mores makes \\"The Falls\\" a major work in the Oates canon. She uses all of her powers here: the facility with the family and its politics (Mulvaneys), her use of violence and degradation (\\"I'll Take You There\\") and her sense of the Gothic (The Barrens).<br />Anyone who has stood in a crevice of one of the cataracts of the Niagara Falls can identify with what Oates writes about that ethereal feeling: \\"Here, your veins, arteries, the minute precision and perfection of your nerves will be unstrung in an instant.\\"<br />With this novel, Oates is at the zenith of her writing powers and not only is her prose fat, juicy and unbelievably gorgeous, it is also both lyrical and forceful.

Even though Gallagher seems like she doesn't mean to be funny, she is...and some of these anecdotes are laugh out loud hilarious.<br /><br />In many ways, we can all relate to this type of family expose in that most of us have had these same types of experiences with our own families. What most of us don't have though, is Gallagher's talent and her facility with the English language, which makes all of this come alive.<br /><br />Though some of \\"HICIMI\\" is sad as befits the subject matter, most of this book is dangerously witty and underhandedly sly.

But just when you think that you have got her pegged, she writes a lovely story like \\"Three Girls\\" about a chance meeting, viewing really of Marilyn Monroe by two uppity yet driven-to-distraction-because they see a star college girls at a bookstore in downtown NYC. (\\"...Marilyn Monroe. She gave us a book. Was any of it real?\\") Then of course she includes \\"The Girl with the Blackened Eye\\" in this collection that recalls her recent \\"Rape...A Love Story\\" and once again writes of a brutal rape.<br /><br />The stories in \\"I Am No One You Know\\" are uneven which pretty much goes hand-in-hand with this type of story collection...i.e. taken from many sources, written over the course of several years. But nonetheless there are several real doozies, for example : \\"Aiding and Abetting, \\" about how families look away when there is real horror amongst their own and how a huge price can be paid for this and \\"Fire\\" about the pleasures of alcohol (\\"Drinking clarified. Confusion dissolved.\\")<br /><br />Oates is equally at home in the short story and the long format form. And, of course she has written brilliantly in both. But there is something about Oates's short stories that draw you in even closer, telescope and make what she is saying even sharper and \\"I Am No One You Know\\" contains some shining examples of this.	2004-08-15

Unfortunately she succeeds only in part.<br /> Despite some trenchant writing, particularly when she is writing about wives, as in \\"The Apology,\\" most of the stories contained herein lack that Stansbury laser intelligence and insight: \\"And if you didn't treat a life that way-if she didn't rise each and every morning with determination and a checklist and consequences for sloth-you were bound, she was bound. To lapse into depression, and to feel trivial and female.\\"<br /> The title story of this collection should have been the centerpiece of this work, the piece around which all the other stories revolve. But instead, Stansbury has the \\"husband\\" go on and on about his wife Kathy: \\"...Why does she have to shop?...What's so important to buy?...Is she a sicko?...is she insane?...like her trying to prove she was good in bed.\\" And on and on ultimately culminating in what amounts to a date rape. If this is an attempt at humor, it falls very very flat.<br /> But when Stansbury's writing is right on...it is right on: \\"I thought my joy, my ecstasy really was from the baby, and a whole lot of it was.

She must think a mere apology-or not even that, just a change in her mood-could erase from a person's mind the fact that she's called him stuffy and pompous and boring and self-righteous.\\"<br />Veritable opposites, Michael and Pauline seem so carried away by the romance of their first meeting and Michael's subsequent entry into the Army that they don't realize how unsuited for each other they are. Pauline: \\"...(Pauline always) gave the rouge and lipsticked version of things...(she's only) concerned with the looks of things, even within the family.\\" Michael: \\"...like blotting paper-just dense and matt-surfaced, absorbing all that came his way and giving nothing back.\\"<br />When the children come, they become the mirror, the reflection back of all that is wrong with the Anton's marriage. As son George reflects: \\"His mother had not been a fluffy-headed dingbat; she'd been...scared, scary, angry, bitter, remorseful unhappy, jealous, bewildered, at a loss.\\"<br />\\"Amateur Marriage\\" is flawed, not Tyler's best work but always readable: filled with Tyler's insightful and gorgeous prose. And as such, it is a must read for all those interested in contemporary American writing.	2004-05-26

The handle with care crowd.\\" Pete is one of a small circle of misfits along with Helen, a minister and Alice, a bartender-biologist who through no fault of their own, find themselves drawn together: more out of desperation than by any kind of attraction personal or otherwise.<br />They all live in Los Angeles, in the Los Feliz-Silverlake-Glendale area, and all are recovering from a Love gone wrong, but they're hopeful: \\"This was the first man since Nick she'd (Alice) kissed in over a year, and the enormity of this step was mitigated by not only a certain relief but also a certain vengefulness, a sense of evening the score...\\"<br />Huneven's style is sardonic and witty and her prose is fat and juicy; oozing with lives well observed.

But Brookner makes the fatal error of adopting the Jamesian style without having his facility at storytelling and his mastery of prose writing.<br />Though the story of \\"The Rules of Engagement\\" takes place in London in the Swinging 1960's through the 1980's, when Brookner makes a reference to those times...discos, Art, etc, it is shocking because her story is so much of a time, and that time is the early 1900's.<br />Elizabeth is an old fashioned girl: one who cleaves to her husband, a much older man and to her friend Betsy with whom she shares a relationship more akin to that of a mother-daughter than one of friends. When she meets Betsy's lover, Daniel she finds him \\"repellent...his humming deprived him of ordinary accessibility and removed any possibility of normal exchange of the kind practiced in the circles in which I moved.\\"<br />Against all normal logic, Elizabeth takes a lover, Edmund in whom she invests not only her time but her so-called emergence as a person: \\"a self which had been obscured by the years of careful living which I could now see for what they had been: erroneous, fallacious, and with a stifling quality I was ready to condemn unreservedly.\\" Unfortunately, Brookner sees fit to give Edmund to Betsy and leaves Elizabeth in a lurch she seemingly recovers from without much effort: \\"in short he (Edmund) lent some of his own glamorous freedom from the pangs of conscience, and I took this as further proof that I have matured in a way that not hitherto been possible.\\"<br />Talk about making a silk purse out of a sow's ear!<br />\\"The Rules of Engagement\\" is supposedly about relationships: those with our mates, our lovers and our friends but it is written in such a bloodless manner that, instead of being moved by these people, we merely snigger at their stupidity and their inability to make any real connection to each other or to us.to us.	2004-02-18

In ?Rape, A Love Story? we have the horrible gang rape of Teena Maguire witnessed by her daughter, Bethie. Much of ?Rape? reads like a police report or something you might watch on Court TV. The writing is very spare, direct, and journalistically precise: ??the woman had to be drunk, high on coke herself, partying since early evening and by midnight you can figure the state she was in, how the hell could Teena Maguire even recognize who had sex with her? And how many??<br />The Love story angle of the title is of course not a straight ahead, direct man-to woman one but one involving a Niagara Falls Policeman, Dromoor, who finds Teena at the crime scene and who takes it upon himself to become her avenging Angel: ?A gun excited him. It was a good feeling. Quickened his pulse so he could actually feel it. Sometimes a tinge in the groin.? .<br />?Rape? is not a treatise on rape, per se, nor is it wholly a comment on the tendency of society to place blame on the victim. What it is, is a serious commentary on the randomness of crime: crime that is too often fueled by drugs and alcohol. More imprtantly though it is about the devastating personal effect crime has on the victim and the family of the victim.<br />Like ?Zombie,? The Rise of Life on Earth? and last years ?Beasts,? ?Rape? is out to make a point about a very specific subject. Oates doesn?t waste any time getting there and uses very few words in the process. ?Rape? is not a major Oates work but it is an interesting, often pathetic and emotionally aware one. And as such it is of interest to all of her fans that crave a quick Oates fix before the next full length novel.	2004-01-23

Her prose style here is not as fat and gorgeous as in her \\"Aguero Sisters\\" but she definitely has her moments: \\"\\"The hot tea burned through him. He lowered his face over the steaming cup, then watched as vaporous bits of his features beaded on the low-slung ceiling...to work the sugarcane fields, his father told him was to go wooing mournful ghosts.\\"<br />In \\"Monkey Hunting,\\" Garcia casts the outcast as a hero: a man with dreams who makes it in a new, hostile world through his hard work and good deeds. That he is not fully accepted by this society in which he hopes to be assimilated, only makes his plight nobler and closer to the reality of the world in which we now live.	2003-12-30

This is not a problem I would think if for one thing said parent was a good person and secondly once married you didn't fall back into the parent/child relationship with your partner.<br />Unfortunately for Ellen in Elizabeth Berg's \\"Say When,\\" she does. It is obvious that her relationship with Griffin is one of parent/child and not husband and wife. Because Griffin is conducive and receptive to this kind of relationship, he also falls into it head first, but unlike Ellen with his eyes open: \\"...he'd been waiting for something like this to happen. She was always just beyond his grasp, in one-way or another. He supposed that her cool reserve was one of the things that attracted him to her.\\"<br />Isn't it funny that we sometimes, somehow get hooked up with the worst possible person for us and that, taking it to the ultimate degree fall in love and even marry him or her? It's as if all your radar is shut down for a period of time and when it is turned on again you wonder, \\"How did I ever get involved with this person?\\"<br />Despite the fact that Griffin is basically a good person, Ellen's radar flips back on and she decides to leave him and her child to sort out her life and to become a responsible adult: \\"...it's important that for once in my life, I take care of myself,\\" she says. Griffin, like most men in this situation had not seen any signs, noticed anything unusual and when he takes to rifling through her desk for evidence he finds nothing: \\"It was all inside her, in the ways she'd changed. Little things-or perhaps not-so-little-things-that he simply ignored.\\"<br />Unfortunately, \\"Say When\\" loses steam about 2/3 of the way through and Griffin and Ellen's situation becomes tiresome. And whereas, in the sublime \\"Never Change\\" and the humane \\"True to Form,\\" Berg is at the top of her form, the prose here seems forced and ultimately common and boring: we stop caring about Griffin and Ellen.<br />Berg has fashioned a career detailing with and wisely commenting on relationships gone bad and exposing and expiating unfulfilled dreams. And she has done it with style and grace. \\"Say When\\" is not Berg at her best but nonetheless, there are still moments of such truth and honesty as to make you gasp with recognition and nod in assent.as fashioned a career detailing with and wisely commenting on relationships gone bad and exposing and expiating unfulfilled dreams.

He is a recovering alcoholic and has spent years trying to graduate from college and at 32, still hasn't. Rinehart does allow Andrew one redeeming quality though and that is his longing and striving to make a family of his stepsons and of course, his wife.<br />Throughout this novel you get the nagging feeling that Rinehart's heart isn't in it: nothing much happens, he has little sympathy for his hero and in the last 5 pages Andrew gets an unwarranted comeuppance and put down.<br />At best the prose is good but many pages go by with Andrew droning on and on making petty and minor observations. I can't help but wonder why Rinehart wrote this book and more importantly why I also chose to finish it.	2003-10-22

So, reading something directly from Oates about her inspirations, her craft and how she goes about actually producing her works was a bit scary for me. It's like meeting a favorite movie star in a one-on-one situation: what if she isn't as smart, as witty, as nice, as perceptive, as devilish as he appears on screen...or in Oates' case, on the written page.<br />But like listening to a good friend relate stories of her life and how she goes about her craft, Oates enlightens rather than frightens: she adds additional insight to her works of fiction rather than tear down my perceptions of them.<br />Oates on writers: (they have)...\\"an affinity for risk, danger, mystery, a certain derangement of the soul; a craving for distress, the predilection for insomnia.\\" And as an extension Oates states these are the people who create \\"the highest form of the human spirit, Art.\\"<br />Going against the common notion that we should write what we know (and Oates's works certainly support this contention): \\"The artist can inhabit any individual for the individual is irrelevant to art.\\"<br />Like most great artists, Oates writes because she can't help it, it's in her blood and anyone who has read any of her works would have to agree that there are drops of blood as well as sweat on each page of her work.	2003-10-12

But when all the stars were right in the heavens (i.e. script, director, co-actors) no one could make as great an impression as did Hepburn, particularly in \\"The Philadelphia Story\\" or \\"Bringing Up Baby.\\" She had enough on screen spunk to let herself be made fun of and that is why she is so beloved.<br />Most of us reading this book were probably looking for the lowdown on Hepburn's relationship with Spencer Tracy and she does give more information here than she does in her 1991 \\"Me.\\" Her asking Berg about the nature and meaning of co-dependency is touching. Being a woman of the mid 20th century, Hepburn of course would not have the enlightenment that we now have about such a subject and that it dug deeply to the core of her relationship with Tracy makes it all the more tragic. Nonetheless Tracy was the great love of her life and it is a blessing that she had Berg as a confidant.

And in one way or another the Avery, Stewart and Elliott men have loved them just the same despite all this hocus-pocus.<br />Hoffman has done this all before, and even though there are some beautifully written passages in the book and the stuff about the Sparrow family traditions are interesting, reading \\"The Probable Future\\" is sometimes a chore.<br />The focus of this novel is the younger group of Unity inhabitants: Stella and Hap Stewart and Jimmy Elliott, Jenny and Will and Matt Avery and to a smaller degree Elinor and Brock Stewart. And this I think is a mistake because it is really Elinor and Brock that have lived full, rounded lives and have much more to say and remember than any of the younger characters, who are more concerned with hairstyles and lipstick and baseball games.<br />\\"The Probable Future\\" is a good novel with some beautifully realized scenes and writing.

The two main characters, old-money wealthy and educated Joshua Seigl and Alma Busch (the tattooed girl of the title) are at the end their respective ropes: Seigl, a JD Salinger-type recluse living off the reputation of his first novel which deals with the survivors of the Holocaust, who can't quite bring himself to complete any of his many works in progress and Alma, a wanton, perpetually down-on-her-luck young woman who carries the marks of her past and of her lifestyle on her face and body.<br />THE TATTOOED GIRL is not by any means one of Oates's strongest recent works but it certainly has it's moments and patented Oatesian scenes such as this one dealing with food and eating: \\"Her rapidly chewing mouth...Saliva glistened in the corners...\\" It has always been interesting to me that Oates, thin and trim in real life, has always written of food and eating in such a manner: uncontrolled, sensually even orgasmically. And she does it here once again.<br />Seigl and Alma reach out for each other but not at the same time. In fact one of the weakest character motivations of this novel has to do with Anna's hate of Seigl because he is Jewish (which technically, he isn't having been born to a gentile mother) and her perceived notion that he thinks himself privileged: \\"Mostly that's why she hated him... he didn't know what he owned.\\"<br />Throughout most of the novel Seigl is completely unaware of Alma's real feelings about him and Alma likewise of Seigl's towards her. The connection is not made until the last few pages when it is too late for both of them to revel in the kind feelings, love and ultimately the redemption of their love for each other.<br />THE TATTOOED GIRL is Oates at her very darkest. And even though the writing is often glorious and redolent with the aroma of truth, this is not Oates at her best: some of the characters are sketchy and could have been left out and some are retreads of characters from earlier novels, especially Alma. (Alma could be exchanged with Ingrid in MAN CRAZY or Anellia in I'LL TAKE YOU THERE.

More importantly all have a deep capacity for love, untapped as it mostly is.<br />Elizabeth Taube, though she complains of not being, is well loved: by Max, a high school teacher who falls compulsively and helplessly for her: \\"So beautiful, Max thought.

I felt myself separated from my flesh and from all earthly things...I had no words for what happened---I have few now, almost forty years later...I learned at aged six, that transcendence was possible: that spirit could conquer matter, and that therefore I could overcome whatever obstacles prevented my mother's loving me. I could overcome myself.\\"<br />But like many who have tortured relationships with a parent, Harrison cannot help but be the dutiful daughter and when her mother becomes ill, she attends to her: \\"In trying to explain why she (Harrison's mother) had been so remote, my mother told me that inside herself she had discovered a fortress, assembled brick by brick by psychic brick to defend herself against my grandmother. `The problem is,' she said, starting to cry, `I don't know the way out. I'm stuck inside myself.\\"<br />So much of this book is so honest and probing that you will have a hard time reading through some sections without wincing at the truthful, heartfelt prose.

Much of the writing is quite beautiful and a much of it is extremely revealing and psychologically true, as in this description of a son's relationship with his father: \\"Outsiders would not understand their exchange. They would not see that his father, far from begging for sympathy, would have considered it out of place. The truth was that there was an understanding; they had no need for embarrassing displays. Saburo thought of the railroad they were drafting at work, its parallel rails never touching, yet exquisitely synchronized, committed in their separateness as they curved though hill and valley. That he was comfortable with. That, he could do.\\"<br />Mary Yukari Waters is a fresh, gentle voice whose writing, on the other hand, reveals a dagger like precision especially when applied to the mysteries and intricacies of Mother/Daughter and Father/Son relationships. I look forward to Yakari-Waters mixing it up a bit in her next book: maybe a novel about the Japanese Youth Culture or one about the Japanese American situation in America during WWII?	2003-06-04

And if it isn't Charlie, who is it?<br />Deborah Schupack's \\"The Boy on the Bus\\" deals with a number of issues in regards to the expectations we all have for our children and what would happen if all the good expectations came to fruition out of the blue and over the course of a school day.<br />Charlie I is an asthmatic, Charlie II is not. Charlie I is a poor eater: \\"Charlie used food as a cover, waiting for something else to happen during a meal. Conversation. He would look at his mother until she looked back, then his eyes would shoot down to his plate and his fork would start working. Sorting, arranging. You couldn't call it eating. But not this boy; he could eat.\\"<br />Children are a work in progress, a blank canvas and it is the totality of their experiences plus genetics that make them into what they eventually become as adults: \\"Imagine...children as approximations...each time your child returned home, he was an approximation of who you had sent out into the world that morning. And each morning, he was an approximation of who you'd tried to seal with a kiss the night before.\\"<br />Ultimately though, \\"The Boy on the Bus' is about Meg. For Meg is the axis around which all the other characters revolve: Charlie I and II, her foul tempered daughter, Katie, her significant other Jeff and the school bus driver, Sandy with whom Meg is carrying on a slight flirtation. Meg is a stranger to her own life and to, except for Charlie and Sandy, those around her: \\"There were times when she came home and could not imagine herself on the inside of the house she was looking at.\\"<br />\\"The Boy on the Bus\\" is a slight novel, an interesting though troubling read because of the central conceit, but not a major work. Schupack writes from the heart and some of the prose is breath taking in its honesty and transparent emotionalism. But ultimately, the Charlie story line hangs on Meg and Schupack's neck like an albatross: instead of furthering and embellishing the novel merely obfuscates it, bogs it down in a quagmire of regret and loss.gs on Meg and Schupack's neck like an albatross: instead of furthering and embellishing the novel merely obfuscates it, bogs it down in a quagmire of regret and loss.	2003-05-21

Be it Ingrid in Man Crazy, or Anellia in Ill Take you There, Oates has always been fascinated, really infatuated with the outcasts, the fringe dwellers, the lonely hearts. More to the point, Oates enjoys writing female characters that struggle and fight against what society considers normal behaviorwhatever the heck normal means in the society of Oates world and in the world in general. It is the tension of this ambiguity that Oates revels in.<br />Small Avalanches begins with the story, Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been? which was the basis for the film Smooth Talk starring Laura Dern as Connie and Treat Williams as Arnold Friend. Reading it again now, and even with the visuals of the film spinning around my head, I was struck by the smoldering sexuality of the story. Connie is 15 and she has one foot stuck in childhood and the other one, always ready to high-tail it to the highway roadhouses, in adulthood. Oates describes her: Everything about her as two sides to it, one for home and for anywhere that was not home: her walk, which could be childlike and bobbing, or languid enough to make someone thinking she was hearing music in here headher laugh, which was cynical and drawling at home but high pitched and nervous anywhere else.<br />Arnold Friend becomes Connies friend, stalker really. Arnold is older, handsome, drives a spiffy car and is definitely dangerous and what he offers Connie is a view of adulthood she cannot turn down: its glamour and attraction cannot be ignored. The denouement finds Connie more experienced in the adult world that she craves but is not ready for. The inevitability of the situation is decidedly sensual yet undeniably moralistic: Connies story is ultimately a cautionary tale. One in which a bad girl gets what she deserves or is asking for. But is she better for it?<br />Oates mines this particular subject matter again in the more up to date, computer savvy story Capricorn also included in this collection.<br />The title story of this collection, Small Avalanches is cruel but slight: a young girl Nancy, through the unaffected, natural conceit and innocence of youth avoids the advances of an older man: He looked so funny, bent over and clutching at his chest, pretending to have a heart attack or maybe having one, a little one, for all I knew. This will teach you a lesson, I thought.<br />It is this youthful innocence and lack of foresight that also imbues Bad Girls a story about three daughters who set out to investigate their mothers boyfriend: Nor did we set out to destroy our mothers man friend Isaak Drumm, exactly(but we) confirmed the neighborhoods and our relatives judgment of us, that we were bad. And not only bad in ourselves but the cause of somebody else being bad, too.<br />Throughout Small Avalanches we encounter writing of uncommon grace: Her eyes were like washed glass, her eyebrows and lashes were almost white, she had a snub nose and Slavic cheekbones and a mouth that could be sweet or twisty and smirky depending on her mood. Or razor sharp writing that cuts to the heart of a matter: Its true, all you have heard of the vanity of the old. Believing ourselves young, still, behind our aged facesmere children, and so very innocent!<br />Small Avalanches was intended for the young peoples market as was Oates earlier Big Mouth and Ugly Girl. But Oates has not toned down her natural gift for revealing the underside and the emotional truth of her characters actions and words. Far from it, she pulls no punches in revealing her patented, twisted yet humanistic worldview. Be forewarned, though: a visit to Oatesiana will leave you a bit shocked and warm under the collar but startlingly as refreshed as having just stepped out of a cool shower on a hot day.ol shower on a hot day.	2003-05-07

Boyle has shrewdly set his new novel \\"Drop City\\" in 1970, three years after The Summer of Love 1967, for it was about this time that the Hippie movement started to sour. Brotherhood, Free Love, Flowers in your hair gave way to the ugly realities of the Draft and the Vietnam War. Whereas, the 60's ideal was a reaching out and hugging your fellow man, the 70's became a time of hugging yourself. A time of: What's-in-it-for-me?<br />Drop City is a commune that has set up shop in the Central Valley of California but soon is forced to move, because of community pressure and run-ins with the law, to Alaska... the last frontier. As in every community, Drop City is peopled (Norm, Star, Marco, Ronnie...the leaders) by a wide variety of personalities each of who have their own personal agenda.<br />As a contrast to the free-lovin', drug ingesting, partner swapping, vegetarian cuisine eating milieu of the commune, \\" Drop City\\" also tells the story of the earnest, hard-working, meat eating, fur trapping, albeit hard drinking denizens of the \\"Thirty Mile\\" area of Alaska especially as personified by Pamela and her husband Sess. It is inevitable that these two factions will collide but Boyle has gone out of his way to also point out the similarities between the two. As Pamela says of Drop City people: \\"It was amazing-they were also so naïve, so starry-eyed and simplistic, filled right up to the eyeballs with crack-brained notions about everything from the origins of the universe to the brotherhood of man...they were children, utterly confident and utterly ignorant-even Norm Sender, and he must have been forty years on this planet. They should have known better. All of them.\\" Sess and Pamela, though well aware of the realities of living in the wild, are open enough to accept the Drop City people...to not only give them a chance but also to guide and teach them. Boyle shows no preference to either faction and you sense that his heart is divided between both camps.<br />Sess Harder is, to say the least an interesting character, a hero really. He is physically and morally strong. He is a combination of Paul Bunyan and Henry David Thoreau. In fact, Boyle quotes Thoreau's \\"Ktaadin\\" at the beginning of Part Six: \\"This was the Earth of which we have heard, made out of Chaos and Old Night.\\" Sess, committed to his survival and to his way of life refuses money offered by the Drop City people to take them to town instead of tending to his traps: ...\\"cash was cash, but the trap line came first because once you set those traps you were obligated by every moral force there was in the universe to tend them, if only to curtail the moral suffering of the living beings that gave you your sustenance, because you didn't waste, you never wasted-waste was worse than a sin; it was death.\\" These are strong, humane and heroic words.<br />\\"Drop City\\" is fascinating: full of interesting and diverse characters in unusual and intriguing situations. Boyle's prose is fat and juicy yet sharp and incisive. It is obvious, especially after his \\"Friends of the Earth\\" that Boyle has an agenda in regards to the planet on which we live but he never lets that get in the way of his telling a good story with characters that live on in your mind even after the last word of the last page is read., to say the least an interesting character, a hero really.

In many cultures, Theresa would be considered a sage or a seer.<br />What she is though is a 15-year-old teen who naturally falls into the caring of other people's children. As she says: \\"Because I was a child myself when I began to take care of other children, I saw them from the start as only a part of my realm, and saw my ascendance as a simple matter of hierarchy---I was the oldest among them, and as such, I would naturally be worshipped and glorified. I really thought no more of it than that...I was Tatiana among her fairies.\\" Theresa's journey through this novel involves mostly baby steps as she goes about her business of caring for the children and pets of the rich. She is a kind of Peter Pan: young enough for her young wards to relate to; but not too old for them to be afraid of.<br />Theresa's parents have big dreams for her as they have made sacrifices so that she can live among the wealthy of the Long Island seashore: \\"I suppose it was one of the ironies of their ambition for me, of their upbringing and their sense of themselves, that they would not see me as fully a part of that brighter world of wealthy people and supposed geniuses if I did not at some point recognize that they were not. That the best assurance they would have that I had indeed moved into a better stratum of society would be my scorn for the lesser one to which they belonged.\\" It's ironic that these ideas still exist today for they call to mind the worlds of Edith Wharton and Henry James, over 100 years ago: that a young girl can change and should aspire to improve her social status by marrying money or genius or better, both.<br />One of the pleasures of this novel is McDermott's lucid and telling descriptions of Theresa's neighbors: \\"Mrs. Richardson was one of those blunt, loud, bangs-across-the-forehead women who seemed to believe that everyone else must surely be as pleased with her as she was with herself for being so no-nonsense and direct and, as she saw it, egalitarian.\\" McDermott's prose is so rich with the experience of living that we almost immediately think of someone in our own lives that could be described in a like manner.<br />\\"Child of My Heart\\" is a gentle, beautifully written and persuasively aware book that's inhabited by characters and situations that calmly though persistently tug at the heartstrings.

In just a couple of years we would also lose two of our pop icons: Jim Morrison and Janis Joplin. So the graduates of 1969 were less inclined to look to the future with unguarded hope for they would be going into a slightly smudged and tainted world: desperately clutching onto their dreams and cautiously, even warily walking toward their adulthood.<br />Even though for the bulk of the novel, O'Brien adopts a very straightforward, almost reporter-like style of prose, when he writes of one character, Spook Spinelli, who has two husbands, (!) he opens up with admiration and a kind of wonder: \\"They were intelligent, open-minded children of the sixties. There was almost no contention. Initially, to be sure, Lincoln had articulated some displeasure at Spook's desire for a second husband, yet he adored her and realized that the alternative was to lose a wife he cared for. Just as important, and much to his credit, Lincoln understood that relationships require fine-tuning, that Spook loved him no less, and that he wasn't losing a wife but gaining an in-law.\\"<br />Tim O'Brien has written a novel and created characters that personify the regret of and the yearning for a time when their most difficult choice was whether to wear the red or the green Izod shirt,the brown or black shoes or who to call for Pizza.

One of the nice things about this novel is the close, supportive nature of Alex and his friends who serve as his personal Greek Chorus: informing and advising Alex throughout the book.<br />Smith also spends much time discussing the \\"jewish-ness or goyish-ness of items, feelings or actions: \\"Goyish trees (oak, Sitka, horse chestnut)...Jewish trees (sycamore, poplar, beech)\\" that is dropped halfway through the novel and never resolved. (Alex is actually writing a book on the subject). Smith seems to lose interest in this plot strand and, instead of excising it, leaves it in for no reason, thereby contributing to the general sloppiness of the narrative flow.<br />The novel hits its stride, though when Alex makes an autograph buying and selling trip to New York where he meets his idol, Kitty Alexander: \\"She is the most beautiful thing that I have ever seen. That's it...I think beauty is the realization of the divine on earth.\\"<br />The New York scenes crackle with excitement and Alex seems to come alive by being in The City and by the idea of his meeting Kitty. When the meeting occurs, Kitty is surprised that Alex is even interested in her: \\"You are really too young to remember my last film, no matter my first, I think...it suggests a lack of sexual intrigue in your life, to be interested in this ancient history. There is no girlfriend, or she is not effective. There is a lack somewhere. I think this must be true.\\" Kitty has no idea about her celebrity or about celebrity in general. So instead of being the kind of recluse akin to Norma Desmond in \\"Sunset Blvd,\\" she is charmingly naïve yet realistic about life. She moved out of her celebrity into a place that allowed her to live a natural, if cloistered life. The character of Kitty proves to be one of Smith's successes in \\"The Autograph Man\\" for she is a fully realized, warm, empathetic and sympathetic character which is diametrically opposed to our general idea of celebrities. She therefore brings a breath of fresh air to the sometimes musty proceedings.<br />\\"An Autograph Man's life is spent in pursuit of fame, of its aura and all the value comes from the degree of closeness to it one can achieve.\\" Smith is also saying that this value is determined in dollars and cents and makes no real contribution to the world. The autograph business is without a soul for it barters and sells mere symbols or signs of a life and is not concerned with the essence of what makes us human: what is in our hearts and minds.<br />\\"The Autograph Man\\" is not a complete success but nonetheless, within its 300+ pages, beats the heart of one who has felt pain and heartache and is searching for ways to quell it's sting and unrelenting sadness..

He has tragically lost his wife and two sons in a plane crash and is wallowing in self-pity and grief when one night he sees a silent movie starring Hector Mann and the course of his life changes dramatically.<br />Zimmer is a writer and professor of Literature and like most with that background looks down on films: \\"I like them in the way that everyone else did-as diversions, as animated wallpaper, as fluff. No matter how beautiful or hypnotic the images sometimes were, they never satisfied me as powerfully as words did.\\" Suffice it to say that Zimmer has a change of heart once he gets immersed in the life and work of the presumed deceased Hector Mann: his films and his disappearance in 1927 under mysterious circumstances. In fact, Zimmer, with nothing to do and with a very large Life insurance settlement in his pocket seeks out Mann's films from film societies around the world and writes a monograph called \\"The Films of Hector Mann.\\" Then the letter from New Mexico arrives asking Zimmer if he would like to meet Hector Mann.<br />The bulk of \\"The Book of Illusions\\" is taken up with a recounting of the life of Hector Mann that is only sporadically interesting. The fascinating part of this novel is Zimmer's realization while watching Mann's films, as well as those of other silent film comedians, that film can indeed be a viable art form: \\"...their work was as fresh and invigorating as it had been when it was first shown. That was because they had understood the language they were speaking. They had invented a syntax of the eye, a grammar of pure kinesis...it was thought translated into action, human will expressing itself through the human body, and therefore it was for all time.\\" A writer responding to a medium in which words are not as important as action...interesting.<br />Zimmer on Mann's film \\"Mr. Nobody\\": \\"It is a meditation on his own disappearance, and for all its ambiguity and furtive suggestiveness, for all the moral questions it asks and then refuses to answer, it is essentially a film about the anguish of selfhood.\\"<br />The writing in these passages about Mann's films and Zimmer's awakening to the realization that film can be art is intelligent and gorgeous.<br />\\"The Book Of Illusions\\" is glorious when Auster is writing about film and much less so when he attends to the machinations of the plot except, for example for a scene that he describes in this way: \\"I was half a step in front of my own body, and when the thing happened just as I thought it would, I felt as if my skin had become transparent.

But whereas, Mavis Staple sings of enlightenment through religion and finding a passage to God and redemption, a \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" as it were, Oates sets her novel in a scholarly,philosophical milieu: in a place and among those who have a definite take on we humans and our place in the cosmos. A place that is decidedly non religious. Philosophers like Spinoza, Pascal and Locke are by nature the questioners as well as the suppliers of answers. This is the nature of Philosophical thought. And even though it may sound like Oates has written a treatise on Philosophy, she has not for with \\"I'll Take You There\\" Oates is back in her old stomping grounds of Obsession, unrequited love and passion unrewarded and unrecognized. As Anellia, our lead character says: \\"I was possessed by the wayward passion of one to whom passion is unknown; denied, and thwarted...\\"<br />Anellia (this is what she calls herself and her real name is never revealed), is a an extremely bright and unsophisticated young woman who secures a scholarship to a college in \\"Upstate New York,\\" and proceeds to throw herself headfirst into college life. Anellia is remarkably ill equipped emotionally and socially to be away from her family much less a member of a sorority,but when she is asked to join Kappa Gamma Pi she jumps at the chance to be part of a \\"family\\" and to have sisters who she hopes will fill a void in her life (\\"...I yearned for sisters: I reasoned that I'd had the others: mother, father, brothers, grandparents...sisters! I would be happy forever, I think.\\"). Anellia fakes it for as long as she can but sorority life is not for her: \\"My Kappa self did not brood, was never melancholy...she had clear skin, shining eyes, a glossy pageboy and lipsticked lips. She was no one I knew personally, but an inspired composite of a dozen Kappa girls...\\"<br />As with most of Oates' characters in many of her novels, Anellia is obsessed with food: \\"...it was the caterers cartons that caught my eye, the aftermath of Saturday night parties, leftover canap&eacute;s, caviar jars where always caviar remained...sometimes I devoured these food where I stood, sometimes I stuffed them into my duffel bag to carry away...sometimes, stricken with remorse or fear of food poisoning, I threw everything away. I saw no contradiction with my ideal and my animal self. As Spinoza said, \\"We yearn to persist in our being.\\"' In another instance, Anellia says:\\"...my mouth watered with saliva like rushing churning ants.\\"<br />In the second section of the novel, \\"The Negro Lover,\\" Anellia finds love and romance with one Vernor Matheius a PhD candidate in Philosophy:\\"...I'd fallen in love with a man's mere voice; not a radiant idea as I'd imagined but a physical condition, like grief.\\"<br />As with most things for Anellia, love does not prove to be a panacea as she spends weeks stalking Vernor before he notices and speaks to her. Vernor is \\"the color of damp earth...a coppery maroon...skin that I imagined would be hot to the touch.\\" At first Vernor will have nothing to do with Anellia, but later relents; feels a sort of compassion for Anellia and they begin an affair of sorts. \\"I can love you. I am the one who can love you. Who am I except the one whose sole identity is that she can love you?\\"<br />As Anellia had fashioned a sophisticated \\"personality\\" to be accepted for awhile in the sorority so she makes herself into someone Vernor can love: \\"Stark and simple and beautiful as gleaming white bones picked clean of all flesh, Now you know. Yet I lived in dread of the one day I would fall utterly and irrevocably into pieces and would lack the strength, the will, the purpose, the faith to reassemble myself another time.\\"<br />The last section of the novel, \\"The Way Out\\" deals with Anellia coming to terms with her father's impending death. As much as the first two sections were red with the fire and explosiveness of emotions, \\"The Way Out\\" is blue and green with the fragrance of remorse and acceptance.

Her characters are intelligent, grown-up people whose lives are at crossroads and it takes all of their life experiences to work their way through their problems and concerns.<br />In \\"True to Form,\\" Katie is a teenager in the early 60's whose concerns are those of an adolescent girl: boys, friends, dates, parents, daydreaming: \\" If the summer were a girl, she'd always be lying stretched out in the grass in a long white dress, her arms over her head, her eyes half closed...I would pay to see stars, but I never have to. This is one of those miracles.\\"<br />Katie spends the novel trying to solve the mysteries and problems of growing up: what does it mean to have and be a real friend? Faced with her first experience with someone close dying: what do I say, what do I do, why did it happen?<br />Berg obviously has a great love for Katie and Katie in turn feels things deeply especially when it involves poetry: \\"Whenever I start a poem, I feel like my heart is about to break. Because of all there is, because of how every single thing can have such a pure beauty that aches to be known.\\"<br />Berg, unwittingly or not, has therefore written a young adult novel in much the same way that Joyce Carol Oates does in \\"Big Mouth and Ugly Girl.\\" She deals with the concerns of young adults without condescension. She simplifies her gorgeous writing style so as to be as concrete as possible so that the life lessons are easily recognized and absorbed.	2002-09-25

In fact it would be a gross understatement. For \\"MLT\\" is a story about Larry, a whacked-out teenager heading for his own destruction at the speed of light: both unaware and seemingly uncaring about his own descent into oblivion and ultimately death.<br />\\"MLT\\" tells the story of the deep underbelly of suburban, privileged teenage life: a life that many of us would rather not hear about. But, to Cooper's credit he does not shy away from the realities of this life and just like the drawing on the book sleeve, we emerge psychically bloodied from the experience of reading about it.<br />The bare bones of the story involve Larry, his brother Jim, friends named Rand (dead at the beginning of the novella), Jude (Larry's erstwhile Girlfriend) and Gilman-a skinhead who has hired Larry to murder a fellow student (known only as \\"the boy\\") for no reason other than for Gilman to possess the boy's notebook. There are also a couple of reporters called the \\"Franks\\"\\" who are following Larry and Jim (\\"I guess she's writing about guys in high school and depression.\\")<br />Larry is the narrator and it is very difficult at times to follow his thoughts which he expresses through a kind of adolescent, valley-boy stream of consciousness:\\" ...she can see depressed guys like we're ghosts. We don't have to move. We don't even have to talk to her first. She says my problem is rage mixed with some bigger word, so I don't interest her...at first I was thinking she'd save me from Jim if she used the right words, but he's too complicated so far. That's her thing...I used to care what was wrong with Jim too, he made it seem that what I did to him helped, but I guess I was sick, and it didn't.\\"<br />Larry, like most teenage guys is having some problems with his sexual identity: \\"He was my best friend. I think he was in love with me, but I wasn't gay, so he turned into a drug addict. Now all my friends are messed up guys who are in love with me.\\"<br />\\"So you fell in love with one of them?\\"<br />\\"It's more like I worry I will.\\" Larry also has problems with alcohol: \\"When I stopped getting drunk, I turned into a liar. That's the only way I could stop.\\"<br />Dennis Cooper has written a difficult, unsparingly cold look at what it is to be a teenager among a very specific group of young adults. Be forewarned that he pulls no punches, leaves no stone unturned. It's going to take me a while to get this book and it's inhabitants out of my mind.s who are in love with me.\\"<BR>\\"So you fell in love with one of them?\\"<BR>\\"It's more like I worry I will.\\" Larry also has problems with alcohol: \\"When I stopped getting drunk, I turned into a liar.

Anyone familiar with her &quot;Nobody's Girl\\" or in particular \\"Living to Tell\\" can attest to that.<br />In \\"Female Trouble\\" she sets her sights on a close to her heart, I would assume subject, women:  Professional women, divorced women, suicidal women, mother-earth women, young women and old women, pregnant women and the men who are fortunate enough to cross their paths.<br />\\"Female Trouble\\" is a short story collection. And I know I am going to get a lot of grief for this but it is a form of which I am not particularly fond. Ideally, a short story should be all of a piece. You should not crave for more. The author has to quickly create a world, inhabit it with interesting characters and resolve the story so that the reader is satisfied at it's resolution. The first story of this collection, \\"Incognito\\" is very well written and the premise is unique: a close group of three high school friends create an imaginary person, one Dawn Wrigley and use this persona as a means to act out all of their adolescent fantasies. The problem is at this story's end I craved for more, wanted loose ends tied, needed more information, felt cheated.<br />On the other hand in \\"One Dog is People,\\" Nelson creates a world in which the basic premise of the story is tied up in a logical fashion with no lose ends hanging. This story also includes some of her most incisive writing: \\"A few days later I was sitting in traffic after dropping the children off at school. I relied on their disappearance every day; I could not stand such thorough neediness. And yet, as soon as they'd been swept into their buildings...I missed them. I fell under the heavy weight of guilt: how could I not be grateful? How could I not cling to what was left to me, cling and cherish?\\"<br />\\"Stitches\\" is in part about the relationship between a college-age girl (Tracy) and her mother (Ellen): \\"It was unnerving to be this girl's mother. She was so forthcoming. So frankly healthy...how had she gotten this way? Ellen felt somehow excluded from the process. She (Ellen) kept secrets---not in drawers or closets or diaries, but in her heart, behind her eyes, on her lips. Tracy's admirable openness seemed not to have been inherited from Ellen, so it must have come from her father.\\"<br />As with most story collections, the quality here is variable. But what does not vary is Nelson's obvious love for her characters and her unflinching desire to get at the heart of things through the use of her gorgeous, even voluptuous writing style.): \\"It was unnerving to be this girl's mother.

Longing for our youth and for the time when our Mothers were very important to us...really the center of our world. It is also about memory and how our memories shape our lives and what happens when we are without a big chunk of them.<br />Samson Greene, a married college professor 36 years old and living in NYC, is found wandering in the desert outside of Las Vegas. He is disoriented, doesn't know who he is or from whence he came. In the hospital he is found to have a brain tumor, which, after removal, leaves him without 24 years of his memories. His wife Anna rushes to his side of course, but he does not recognize her: \\"He could not absorb everything she was trying to tell him. When she told him that his mother had died he felt it like the clean break of a bone and a sound came from him that he did not recognize. When he was too exhausted to weep any more he lay in silence, all his being drained to the flat line of the heart stilled.\\"<br />Anna takes Samson home to New York and they try to reconvene their marriage but it is not easy: \\"You don't know. You don't know! She (Anna) shouted...I still love you. I've lost you and yet you're still here. To taunt me...\\"<br />Krauss or Samson really, refers back again and again throughout the novel to the loss of his mother: \\"It was as if he had been sleeping when she died, or worse laughing his head off at a party. It had always been the two of them; it was as if he had closed his eyes and then, when he opened them, he was old and she was gone.\\" Samson later, towards the end of the novel, as a way of explaining his being found in the desert outside Las Vegas, feels that he was trying to find his way home from New York to California much like the Swallows find their way home to Capistrano every year...not just out of tradition and custom but because it was only at home and with his Mother that he really felt safe and secure.<br />Krauss' style is gorgeous, succinct and intelligent throughout but it is especially effective during Samson's reveries about his Mother, as in this quote about what she taught him about loss: \\"To touch and feel each thing in the world, to know it with your eyes closed so that when something is gone, it can be recognized by the shape of its absence. So that you can continue to possess the lost, because absence is the only constant thing. Because you can get free of everything except the space where things have been.\\"<br />So much of contemporary fiction and film seems centered around the notion of recapturing a lost childhood or reconstructing an idealized family life that may or may not have existed; be it \\"The Road to Perdition\\" or Nicole Stansbury's \\"Places to look for a Mother.\\" Add \\"Man Walks Into A Room\\" to that list.<br />Nicole Krauss has done an outstanding job of creating a world gone awry and inhabiting it with characters of substance and interest.

Yet here it is from the prolific Oates, \\"Big Mouth and Ugly Girl.\\"<br />BMUG chronicles the high school and family life of Ursula Riggs(known to herself as \\"Ugly Girl\\") and Matt Donaghy (Big Mouth).<br />The plot is very simple and up-to-date newspaper headline-wise as Matt is accused of plotting to blow up his high school and Ursula, though heretofore not a friend of Matt's, comes to his rescue out of a sterling sense of \\"what is right.\\"<br />Both Ursula and Matt suffer from what most of us suffered in high school: self-esteem problems, not feeling part of any group, hating our parents and siblings, etc.<br />Oates,being the master craftswman that she is, takes this rather tepid plot and fills it with telling details of both Matt's and Ursula's life after the accusation which sets the plot in motion:\\"It was like Matt had been wounded somwhere on his body he couldn't see, and the wound was visible to others, raw and ugly.  When they looked at him, they saw just the wound. They weren't seeing Matt Donaghy any longer.\\"<br />Under normal high school clique circumstances Matt and Ursula would have never made a connection.  But through Ursula's sense of what is right and her acting upon it; and despite her parents objections, Ursula and Matt become a couple.<br />The moral of the story is simple but definitely needs restating to teenagers, but not only to teenagers, especially when it is restated in the glorious, tight and controlled prose of Joyce Carol Oates.<br />What Oates has done is pare down her gorgeous style to the bare minimum of words necessary to convey a mood, a thought or an emotion.  What lessons and morals are to be learned can be easily picked off like so many berries off a tree.  But in no way whatsoever does the storytelling seem didactic or obvious or over-simplified.<br />Joyce Carol Oates has fashioned a novel for teenagers brimming over with morality and resposibilty but has done it in a way that does not talk down to her specific audience.  All of we Oates fans need not be wary of this book as it is wriiten on the highest level of craftsmanship and deserves a special place in the oeuvre of one of our finest contemporary writers.sposibilty but has done it in a way that does not talk down to her specific audience.

No, Miriam is a combination of Roseanne and Martha, of &quot;Who's Afraid of Virgina Woolf.&quot; There is warmth there in Miriam and there is some wisdom but mostly there is an unabiding, though misconceived love for her daughters and their welfare...at least most of the time.  For Miriam is a dreamer: a woman who is always looking for something better in the future yet cannot help but look back for solace in the past. Miriam is a rich person with no money, a beautiful person with bad teeth and badly dyed hair and a person with social standing born to non-descript parents.<br />&quot;places to look for a mother&quot; is Lucy's recollection of a life with her Mom not precisely fondly remembered: &quot;The only way my dad seemed to know how to handle her (Miriam) was by keeping her in line, shame her into acting like a good wife and mother, and I thought that overall his technique was a good one, because my Mom needed limits. Without them she went crazy, like a little kid who had too much to choose from.&quot;<br />Lucy's story and to a lesser degree Jen's is the story of a navigation through their Mom's neuroses, manic depression, delusions of grandeur and ultimately her unrelenting power over them:&quot;...and that was the moment of her waiting for me to go to her, which I did because I lived then the way any kid did, in the present, hungry and needing to pee, and sad, and because she was my mom.&quot;<br />As kids we are all attracted as well as repelled by our parents: &quot;Sometimes my mom talked like there was a cartoon balloon over her head. &quot;Sniff sniff&quot; she'd say, if you didn't offer her a bite of whatever you were eating...or she talked like evrything was too much for just one tiny woman to handle...&quot;help me, please help&quot; She'd look around, like someone other than us actually was going to show up...Please won't anyone ever help me?&quot;<br />There is one scene towards the end of the novel in which Miriam, ridiculously unaware of her own liabilities, describes her own parents:&quot;..you don't know what it's like, you girls are lucky, you never had toxic parents, ones who would just poison poison you because they were all about me, me, me. I listen to you and your sister because I really care. I have empathy.&quot; This statement, unbeknownst to Miriam at the time, is a precise description of herself and her treatment of her children.<br />After all is said and done, after several men come and go, after both Lucy and Jen have moved into adulthood, they seem to come to an understanding of their mother's craziness and the last chapter deals with their fond memories of Miriam. One is especially poignant, dealing with Miriam's behavior during Lucy's bouts with migraines: &quot;She smiles and says pretend it's not happening, let yourself go far far away...there is no other way than her. Does that sound extravagant? Or should I say there is no other place than her. My bitch of a mother, in whom I am placed, all these years later, still.&quot;<br />Nicole Stansbury has done a monumental job of making these people pop off the page into our psyches; mostly because their situations strike cords on our collective hearts, minds and souls. We Love our Mom's and sometimes we hate them but most of the time, as we ultimately come to understand, they are doing the very best that they can.of whatever you were eating...or she talked like evrything was too much for just one tiny woman to handle...&quot;help me, please help&quot; She'd look around, like someone other than us actually was going to show up...Please won't anyone ever help me?&quot;<BR>There is one scene towards the end of the novel in which Miriam, ridiculously unaware of her own liabilities, describes her own parents:&quot;..you don't know what it's like, you girls are lucky, you never had toxic parents, ones who would just poison poison you because they were all about me, me, me.

Robert Hellenga's \\"Blues Lesson\\" is not only about what happens when one follows one's dream but also when one doesn't.<br />Martin is a young man of Appleton, Michigan living on an apple farm who has big dreams of going to college and making something of his life.  His mother in particular, who teaches languages at the local high school shares and even pushes him towards her alma mater, the University of Chicago.<br />But Martin has a couple of other interests: the Blues, which he hears the day laborers, employed by his father, sing really rejoice in... and a young lady named Corrina Williams.<br />When Corrina becomes pregnant with Martin's child and leaves town at the behest and with the financial backing of Martin's parents, Martin's life goes into a tailspin: he drops plans for college, gets a job with the US Postal Service and fervently pursues the learning and performance of the Blues.<br />Hellenga has some magical things to write about performance: \\"Every night, at small venues around the country, thousands of performers like me walk out onto small stages to sing their songs, to tell their stories...sometimes we die a thousand deaths; but other times the music opens our hearts, lifts the veil of familiarity, reveals the mysterious inner life of things--raw,fresh, fragile.\\"<br />Robert Hellenga's \\"Blues Lessons\\" is a gentle story, rife with the every day things of lives, missed connections, unfulfilled dreams and mis-placed emotions.

In novels of Obsession it is absolutely necessary that the object of said obsession be portrayed as extraordinary in one way or in many ways or another.  Think about \\"Lolita\\" and Humbert Humbert: Lolita was very young, very beautiful, very nubile and very forbidden. Or think of Gustave's obsession in \\"Death in Venice,\\"Tadzio to whom oddly enough, the same  adjectives above can apply.<br />In John Burham Schwartz's \\"Claire Marvel\\" we have a novel of Obsession in which the object of said obsession is portrayed as little more than someone beautiful who flits in and out of the protaganist Julian Rose's life over the course of 15 years; not even developed enough to be called an enigma. Even though Tadzio and Lolita are mere ciphers; repositories of their obsessors collective fantasies, they have \\"lives\\" within this context that makes them viable in the world of their novels. Claire Marvel does not. Schwartz paints her in the broadest, vaguest strokes:...\\"eyes alive with amusement; a refined nose...straight brown hair....a body slender and lithe.\\" Julian's relationship with Clare is the least interesting in the entire novel. It's as if Schwartz lost interest in her when he realized that other characters like his father, his PHD thesis advisor or one of his troubled students proved to be the easier write.<br />For a supposed love story, \\"Claire Marvel\\"'s  better developed characters are ancilliary like Julian's father for example.  Through the course of the book, Julian's relationship with his father develops from estrangement and distrust, based on Julian's mother separation from his father, to a touching scene near the end of the novel, set in a park, between the two: \\"For an hour we stayed there, not saying much....I remembered walking in the park as a little boy holding my father's hand.....then I felt his hand on my shoulder. He squeezed hard and for a long time, and the pressure rose at the bottom of my throat was almost unbearable...he didn't know the comfort he gave, just sitting on that bench with me.  Though I hoped he did.\\" A simple scene ,where most of the emotion is held back, but beautifully composed and written. Unfortunately there are no such scenes between Julian and Clare that reach this level of refinement.<br />There are several other scenes in \\"Clare Marvel\\" that are beautifully written and Schwartz is obviously a fine writer,  but when the central issue of a novel is as underdeloped as it is here, I would have to say the \\"Clare Marvel\\" is a failure....a sometimes gorgeously written failure, but a failure nontheless.ust sitting on that bench with me.

But this isn't all that \\"TIGO\\" is.  It's also a gentle, humourous observation of Life here in the USA circa 2002. Parking as metaphor: where and why we don't fit in; can't find our niche. Murray Tepper as Exestential Man trying to carve out a place for himself and his car; always staying within the boundaries, feeding the parking meters, always parking legally. This is not Kavka's Worm unaware of why he finds himself in his circumstances for Murray Tepper is all to aware of his.<br />Murray Tepper is a gentle man, married, part owner of a marketing list company who enjoys driving around NYC looking for legal parking places in which to stop and read his evening paper.<br />By doing so, he draws the ire of NYC's mayor (named appropriately Ducavelli or \\"Il Duce\\") who hates \\"disorder in any form.\\"<br />When Tepper naturally becomes a celebrity, people drop by his car and ask for advice: relationship, business, money, etc. The manner in which Tepper replies (or more to the point doesn't reply) to these inquiries reminds me a lot of the  Peter Sellars character in \\"Being There\\" as Tepper mostly smiles and agrees and allows the questioner to work through his own question until he finds the answer himself yet hilariously credits Tepper.<br />It's fun to note the Trillin was also involved in a one issue magazine named \\"Beautiful Spot: A Magazine of Parking.\\"<br />Trillin is not out to write the Great American Novel here but nonetheless he's accomplished what few writers do: he's written about the everyday things and concerns of life and made them important enough so that we the readers exalt them. As DH Lawrence said: \\"Do away with masters, exalt the will of the people.\\"he will of the people.\\"	2002-02-28
US	48497303	RVJ5Z348DZHOM	0880013850	188712994	On Boxing	Books	4	33	33	N	N	Sugar Ray Oates	The sport of Boxing, on the surface at least, does not automatically come to mind as obvious subject matter for the premier writing talents of Joyce Carol Oates; even though Ms. Oates certainly can get down and dirty with the best of them as in her \\"Man Crazy\\" or \\"Zombie.\\"<br />But as Oates explains in her 1987 collection of essays (revised in 1994), \\"On Boxing\\":\\"No one whose interest began as mine did in childhood--as an offshot of my father's interest is likely to think of boxing as something else, a metaphor...Life is like boxing, in many respects. But boxing is only like boxing.\\"<br />Oates is a boxing fan and a great writer and it was inevitable that these two facets of her life would converge.<br />\\"On Boxing\\" is really 3 separate essays: \\"On Boxing,\\" \\"On Mike Tyson\\" and \\"The Cruelest Sport.\\"<br />The first essay is so crammed full of fascinating, revelatory statements about the nature and function and the social and psychological nature of boxing that it is hard to pick out only a few to quote here. But I will try: \\"To enter the ring near-naked and to risk one's life is to make of one's audience voyeurs of a kind: boxing is so intimate. It is to ease out of sanity's consciousness and into another, difficult to name. It is to risk, and sometimes to realize, the agony of which \\"agon\\" (Greek, \\"contest\\") is the root.\\"<br />In Oates view, the boxer brings more than his body to bear in the ring...he also brings his soul: \\"There are some boxers possessed of such remarkable intuition, such uncanny prescience, one would think they were somehow recalling their fights, not fighting them as we watch.\\"<br />\\"On Boxing\\" the essay is also a boxing history lesson highlighting the careers of Jack Dempsey,Joe Louis, Muhammed Ali,Sugar Ray Leonard, Roberto Duran, etc.: their careers, their boxing styles, their defeats and in some cases their lives after the boxing ring: \\"the drama of life in the flesh. Boxing has become America's tragic theater.\\"<br />The second essay, \\"On Mike Tyson,\\" written in 1988 predates all of Tyson's legal troubles, court cases and incarceration.

But memory is never like that. It makes hills of feeling in collapsed hours, a scene of enclosure made all precious by its frame.\\"<br />It is the Narrator (never identified) who makes the comment above in Lydia Millet's, \\"My Happy Life,\\" a woman who has had almost no real happiness in her life and who always recovers from whatever blows and misfortunes life deals her without any ill feelings or rancor. She is resilient to a fault..always looking on the bright side, always making excuses for those who mistreat her.<br />We all know this woman. She's the one who cleans our hotel rooms or offices. She's the one with the bad haircut and out-of-style coat whose smile we do not return on the street. She's the one we hope never to become.<br />But Millet makes her a heroine with a profound sense of insight and razor sharp introspection...a kind of life experience idiot savant. And in the end....we, at the very least, admire her and maybe even secretly want to be her.<br />The Narrator takes us to her bosom early on when she says: \\"so now I seem alone...But I am not alone...I have You.\\" And that she does through 150 pages of heart-wrenching bad luck and unspeakable misfortune. But nonetheless, the tone of the novel is sweet with the fragrance of a life fondly remembered.<br />Our Narrator is \\"Everywoman\\" and by extension Everyman: exploited, abandoned, discarded, imprisoned, rejected, made invisible by age. Millet seems to be saying: Look at this woman, Look at this Life, Look how she recovers and perserveres... Don't complain to me about your petty upsets and daily trials and tribulations! Here is how it is in the extreme...in a place where you can't fathom from where your next kind word or small affirmation will come; much less your next meal.<br />Along the way Millet composes some breathtaking phrases and descriptions: \\"So I was not alone. With me were the absent people. And all of them were not bodies but only the forms of all their sorrow and longing. By and by I felt what I had always known, that myself I was neither a city nor a rock, but only particles and figments. And like all people I was quite imaginary when I was alone. And alone we were all of us ghosts.\\"<br />\\"My Happy Life\\" is anything but.

Joyce Carol Oates often uses the novella form to explore the stranger, darker, more sexual side of man. Think \\"Zombie\\" and it's portrayal of a barely literate serial killer (\\"They want somebody to love and live for---women. It doesn't matter who like it would with a man. & for lunch preparing big grilled cheese sandwiches for me crossed with strips of bacon I was crazy for as a boy visiting Grandma...\\") or \\"The Rise of Life on Earth\\" (\\"It was Joseph Hennessy's story that he had never beaten either of his daughters though in his general attitude he seemed to acknowledge that one, or both might be dead.\\")<br />\\"Beasts\\" is the story of Gillian Brauer, a college student at Catamount College and like many other college students, she is filled with fears and neuroses, hates her parents and generally feels out of place. Gillian is also desperately in love with her English professor, Andre Harrow and his wife Dorcas, an artist. Desperation is tantamount to Obsession and Obsession is a Joyce Carol Oates calling card..her stock in trade. So Gillian cannot merely love \\"from afar.\\" No, she insinuates herself into the Harrow household becoming their maid, confidant,lover and ultimately their downfall...their Angel of Death.<br />A beast is a brute animal. It ravages, consumes, satisfies it's base desires at will without any thought or care of consequences.<br />Oates paints a hyper reality in \\"Beasts\\": one in which every female is  willing, super-sexual, compliant and every male more than willing to take advantage of these traits. It's the reverse of Heaven; it's Hell, where reason and grace are thought of as archaic and satisfying one's appetites is the highest form of \\"good.\\" And good must always conquer bad, even in Oates world, and the ultimate vanquishment is one by fire...and so it is done as it was with the sinners and blasphemers in Dante's \\"Inferno.\\" Immolation is the only way out...the only solution.<br />\\"Beasts\\" is a disturbing, violent, ultra-sexual story sure to shock some and titillate others...and some will feel both. But ultimately \\"Beasts,\\" like all of Oates' fiction, whether it be \\"Them\\" or \\"Do with me as you Will\\" which it resembles thematically, asks many more questions than it answers and resonates and reverberates long after the last page is turned and the last word is read.e and titillate others...and some will feel both.

I suppose that many will take Sue Miller's &quot;The World Below&quot; as a quiet, subdued examination of the lives of two women:  Georgia and her grand daughter, Catherine....and leave it at that.  And unfortunately, except for some well written passages it is...just that.  But having just read Leif Enger's &quot;Peace like a River&quot; and Joyce Carol Oates'&quot;Middle Age,&quot; I can't let Miller off the hook so easily.  What these two novels have that Miller's work doesn't is a point of view, a substantial world view that would give &quot;The World Below&quot; some pizazz, some oomph...something to take you beyond the bare bones of the storyline.<br />The basic story of &quot;The World Below&quot; is somewhat interesting: a woman, Catherine Hubbard, is willed her grandmother's house and she, needing a change of venue after two failed relationships , decides to visit this home in Vermont.  While there, Catherine discovers a cache of her grandmother's journals.  The novel then becomes the story of these two women and the narrative moves back and forth between these two lives. And this is a good thing because the &quot;Georgia&quot; portions of this novel are the most interesting and provocative as they relate Georgia's stay in a TB sanitarium and her subsequent marriage to her much older doctor and the problems inherent therein.<br />Miller can write beautifully when so inclined: &quot;The thick flakes coming out of the dark at the windshield, the steady shuddering slap of the wipers, the vehicles looming ahead of me on the road--all this was hypnotic...the flakes landed silently on the car and melted with the engine's heat..light that fell into the yard and made the steadily falling snow seem thicker and heavier than it was.&quot;<br />In &quot;The World Below,&quot; Miller spends her time and efforts on the exposition of this story...propelling the novel forward.  But where's the attutude?  Where's the interpretation of these words to make it all more substantial and therefore more personal, interesting and multi-layered?<br />In the past, Miller has proven to have the skills to make her words sing not only in our heads but in our hearts and souls.

US	48497303	RYGF01HWFAH32	087113795X	996091853	Peace Like a River	Books	5	386	415	N	N	Reuben Land, Holden Caulfield and Francis McCourt	I've had to re-write this review three times because the first drafts made me sound like a gushing, blushing school girl.  That's how enamored of this novel I am. Leif Enger's &quot;Peace Like A River&quot; is the story of the Land family set in the early 1960's in rural Minnesota:  Jeremiah the father, Davy the eldest son, Reuben, 11 yrs old and the novel's narrator, and Swede, daughter and sister, verse writer and an &quot;Old West&quot; afficianado.  The story itself is simple: Davy kills two young men who have broken into the Land home, is put on trial for murder and escapes jail when it seems he is to be convicted.  Obviously this turns the Land Family upside down and the bulk of the novel is concerned with finding Davy and forging, through necessity, a new life for all. The novel begins with the birth of Reuben, who appears stillborn until Jeremiah enters the operating room: &quot;As mother cried out. Dad turned back to me, a clay child wrapped in a canvas coat, and said in a normal voice, &quot;Reuben Land, in the name of the living God I am telling you to breathe.&quot;  And so begins the first of the &quot;miracles&quot; which occur throughout this novel. And no, this is not a religious novel per se though faith is very important to the Land family, Jeremiah is particular. And Leif Enger is not only concerned with the hereafter, he's also very aware of the here and now.  I've never read a novel that mentions, explains, makes reference to such a disparate set of characters: Teddy Roosevelt, God, Jesus, Butch Cassidy, Robert Louis Stevenson, Bob and Cole Younger, Jesse James,Swanson chicken-in-a-can, &quot;Moby Dick,&quot; Lewis and Clark, Moses, Natty Bumppo, Jonah (&quot;...such a griper. Whine all day. Probably God sent the whale so He could get three days of peace and quiet.&quot;). And much more.  Enger, obviously bursting with knowledge, makes these references out of a need and a love to inform and in the process inbues his characters with these same qualities ( As a contrast,in &quot;American Psycho,&quot; Bret Easton Ellis makes ten times as many cultural references than does Enger but the effect is showy,coy and ultimately boring).  There is also great Love and caring in &quot;Peace Like a River.&quot;  The Land's truly love each other with the kind of love that accepts, forgives and annoints themselves and each other as in holy communion.<br />&quot;Peace Like A River&quot; is energetic, magical and beautifully written in a style that can only be called gorgeous: &quot;Was there ever a place you loved to go--your grandma's house, where you were a favorite child...and you arrived once as she lay in sickness? Remember how the light seemed wrong, and the adults off-key and the ambient and persistent joy you'd grown to expect in that place was gone, slipped off as the ghost slips the body?&quot; &quot;Peace like a River&quot; can now take it's place among the pantheon of similar-themed novels:  Barry Udall's &quot;The Miracle Life of Edgar Mint,&quot; J.D.

What makes this story different is that Sarafina, the mother, is a &quot;Mixtec&quot; or native Mexican woman from Oaxaca, Mexico and her daughter Elvia is an American, born of Larry Foley, a day laborer a couple steps above Sarafina in the social stata.  It is this clash of cultures, to quote an old phrase, which adds depth and resonance to this already emotional situation. Sarafina, an illegal alien, is deported as a result of a freak traffic accident and Elvia, asleep in the car at the time is erroneously placed in foster care as a result. Larry searches for Elvia but it takes 10 years for him to find her. Sarafina spends the same amount of time trying to to make it back to the USA from Mexico while also having to deal with her mother's declining health. Unfortunately, Straight tells this story in an almost bloodless manner, dry of emotion...a sociology tract. Straight is using this novel as a way of informing us of the plight of the illegal alien and thus is more interested in the &quot;world view&quot; rather than the specifics. It is only in Elvia's scenes with a foster mother, Sandy Narlette that Straight loosens up the sociology and writes with candor and feeling. Sandy is Elvia's anchor, her home the only place where she always felt/feels wanted and loved and Sandy returns this love in kind. If only the entire novel would have the same emotional weight as these scenes between Sandy and Elvia. An interesting note is that &quot;Highwire Moon&quot; has been nominated for a National Book Award in Fiction. And to the National Book Award committee this subject matter must have seemed as foreign as a novel set in Greenland..maybe more so. But for those of us living in a border state this is a situation that we face every day..it is a part of our lives.

Almost immediately, at the very beginning of Joyce Carol Oates, &quot;Middle Age, A Romance,&quot; you come upon her dedication which reads: &quot;To my Princeton friends, who are nowhere in these pages.&quot;  Oates is, of course a professor of Humanities at Princeton University.More importantly, this dedication serves as Oates notice to her readers that the characters in &quot;Middle Age&quot; are a breed, a type, of a world... apart from herself and her friends.  She is setting up a barrier between herself and her characters.  As a general rule, in most cases this would not be a good sign for the reading to come.  But because Oates has proven to be masterfull at best and interesting at least we take the dedication with a grain of salt and read on.  &quot;Middle Age&quot; is Oates ode to middle age among a tightly-knit group of mostly wealthy residents of Salthill-on-Hudson in upstate New York.  The catalyst for the various stories is one Adam Berendt whose death prompts a flood of tears and concern among the women and men of Salthill that propells the novel through it's various chapters.  Add to this the fact that Berendt appears to be without family, has always been mysterious about his background and the source of his income, that the men seem as attracted to him as do the women and that he has not had sex with any of his many admirers, and you have the beginnings of a fascinating novel. Oates, though seemingly detached from her flood of characters is nonetheless very sympathetic towards them and as a result we are also. The style of &quot;Middle Age&quot; is a departure for Oates: very much unlike the furtive, paranoid, sexually explicit &quot;Man Crazy&quot; or the technicolor, movie-like &quot;We Were the Mulvaneys.&quot;  In &quot;Middle Age&quot; Oates is removed yet ultimately attracted to her characters: longing for their lifestyle yet damning of their foibles.  It is ultimately not a great novel in the sense that &quot;Mulvaneys,&quot; &quot;Because it is Bitter and Because it is my Heart&quot; or &quot;What I Lived for&quot; are for example. But a good Joyce Carol Oates novel is worlds above most author's best and because of this a must read for anyone serious about contemporary fiction.is Bitter and Because it is my Heart&quot; or &quot;What I Lived for&quot; are for example.

White's &quot;A Dream of Wolves&quot; begins Stuart and Annabel Jordan lose their son Will in a freak hiking accident. Annabel, a manic depressive and alcoholic, whose hold on reality is tenuous at best, cracks up for good and takes to appearing and disappearing from Stuart's life at will always knowing that Stuart will be there to care for her and tend to her neuroses. Stuart, ever the good husband does exactly that, becoming in essence Annabel's co-dependent, obsessed with here whereabouts and well being. There is a very telling motif that runs through the entire novel: Annabel's hands. Stuart, as a way of gauging the level of Annabel's mania, is continually watching her hands: &quot;Her hands, I noticed, began to tremble again. They shook as she lit her cigarette or sipped her tea....they made me think of my father's hands, when the Parkinson's was well advanced. And her eyes had that all-to-familiar unsettled look, darting restlessly about...&quot; This is a classic indication of co-dependency: the continual searching for signs that all is well ...or not. It is not until Stuart begins an affair with a local D.A. Bobbie Tisdale, during one of Annabel's &quot;disappearances&quot;, and also begins to care for an accused murderer's daughter (Maria) that Annabel's hold on him starts to unravel. Annabel, naturally and inevitably arrives on the scene &quot;to help&quot; Stuart and care for the child. And for a time Annabel is lucid, taking her medication and tending to the child, the house and the garden. But will it last? White has done a good job of melding all the disparate elements of this novel together (I have only mentioned a few) but ultimately the way he chooses to end the novel is not satisfying and even more damaging it seems tacked on; an afterthought that merely ties up all the various subplots. The most tender and well-written scenes are those dealing with Stuart's relationship with Annabel. It's a shame that White did not base his entire novel on that.base his entire novel on that.	2001-09-13

Her writing is honest, direct and effective and her themes are almost always about love, love lost, relationships between family or that among friends and lovers, husbands and wives. Even with her &quot;Practical Magic,&quot; which at first glance might not seem to adhere to the above, it's the relationship between the sisters that carries the most weight and propells the novel. With Hoffman you are always aware that there is a kind, warm heart and soul behind every word she writes and every situation she creates in the world of her novels. Hoffman's latest novel, &quot;Blue Diary&quot; definitely falls into this &quot;Hoffman Universe&quot; in that a family: Ethan Ford, husband and father, Jorie,wife and mother and their son, Collie, 12 years old are faced with the fact that Ethan, 15 yrs prior had raped and killed a 15 yr old girl in a small Maryland town. The bulk of the novel is not only about the effect of this tragedy on Jorie and Collie but also on their friends and their neighbors in Monroe, Mass. There is never any doubt that Ethan has done this as he admits to it immediately (&quot;He got down on his knees right then and there, and as he did, he felt himself leave his own body. The responsibility of his deeds descended upon him like a mountain of murderous stones, and for the first time in his life, he cried&quot;). Hoffman raises a number of questions in regards to honesty, trust, the sanctity of marriage and more importantly: How well can we ever really know someone? Unfortunately, because this situation is so rife with reprecussions and revelations the narrative runs out of steam about 2/3 of the way through. Too many characters are called upon to comment on Ethan's (really Byron as he changed his name after the murder) crime that we lose sight of the man himself. And I think this is a bad miscalculation on Hoffman's part as it robs the story of it's primary character and our understanding more about what makes him tick.It is his crime afterall that propells this novel forward but he becomes a minor character at best for most of the novel once he's put in jail. For example we learn about his son Collie's reaction which, of course makes sense. But do we need to know about the Ford's neighbor Rosarie, her love life and how many boyfriends she's had? Jorie's trip to Maryland and the scene of the crime and her meeting with the murdered girl's (Rachel) brother James is very touching and involves some first rate writing: &quot;Rachel was beautiful. Jorie can see that even in the half light of the living room. She was a real live girl with hopes and dreams who loved the beach...she was a girl who walked into the swamp for rose mallows and who had onced raced her horse, Sugar, all the way to the pharmacy in the center of town, where she yodeled at the top of her lungs, then galloped her way home through the woods, all for a dollar bet made with her brother...She looks like someone I would have liked, Jorie says.&quot; So much of what makes a book, movie or play good involves making the right choices.

Nick Hornby's &quot;How to be Good&quot; is like it's chief protaganist, Katie Carr in that she means well but doesn't succeed as often as she'd like.  Katie is a harried doctor and primary bread winner married to David,crabby newspaper columnist a la Andy Rooney and mother to Molly and Tom. Suddenly, almost overnight David transforms himself into an erstwhile Gandhi and attributes this change to a &quot;hot hands&quot; healing man that calls himself &quot;Good News&quot;: &quot;Good News is my name now.  Because that's what I want to bring, see.&quot;  David and Good News strike out with a plan to save the world by placing street people into neighborhood homes and giving away Tom and Molly's toys, computers and clothes to those more in need and encouraging everyone to do the same.  The party that David throws to introduce this idea to his neighbors is hilarious as most of his neighbors think David has gone bonkers yet produces homes for 6 street people nonetheless!  All through this book Katie has a running commentary and much of what she says is funny and witty. As in this scene with one of her regular patients, &quot;Barmy&quot; Brian who Katie invites to the &quot;save the homeless party.&quot;  Brian replies: &quot;How many people are at a party?  More than seventeen?&quot; Katie: &quot;There will be more than seventeen at this one, probably, Why?&quot;  Brian:  &quot;I can't go anywhere where there's more than seventeen people.That's why I can't work at the Supermarket, you see...could I come maybe the day after, when they're all gone?&quot; Katie: &quot;Then it wouldn't be a party, though.....we'll try and have one with sixteen. Another time.&quot; Brian: &quot;would you?&quot; Katie: &quot;I'll see what I can do.&quot;  A lot of the book is written in this loopy style with an auditorium full of people moving in and out, some literally, of Katie and David's life.  In a strange way we are pulling for both Katie and David to succeed in their opposite goals but by the last third of the novel a sourness takes hold in David that simply does not ring true to the general tone of the book heretofore and to the natural progression of David's character. It's as if Hornby loses interest in the story and in David and hurries the novel to a close.  I think he would have been better served with a stronger editor but there is definitely some fun stuff in &quot;How to Be Good&quot; and I recommend it nonetheless.by the last third of the novel a sourness takes hold in David that simply does not ring true to the general tone of the book heretofore and to the natural progression of David's character.

Shickler writes about the young and the old, the married and the single, the pretty and the not so pretty in a style that can only be described as lush and even poetic at times.  Shickler also writes about the serious, the funny/witty,the crazy and of things that cannot be categorized as easily. Note the style and tone of this passage in &quot;Jacob's Bath&quot; for example: &quot;it was as if Jacob had been climbing a mountain all his years and had come now to a decent peak, where there was a woman and a well of water.  The woman was there to strengthen the man, to quench his thirst, and the man loved the woman and he was grateful...&quot; (feminists will have a field day with this) Simple, direct and redolent of sensuality.  Shickler introduces us to cavalcade of characters some memorable like James Branch in &quot;The Opals&quot;: &quot;twenty-five, single and shy with sleepy blue eyes and straight teeth&quot; or the Bonners: Nicole, Samson and Paulette in &quot;The Smoker,&quot; or Rally in &quot;Kissing in Manhatten.&quot;  Rally is a travel writer who kept traveling because &quot;when the wonder of an individual human being struck her--when an Irishwoman took smoke in her mouth, or a park ranger's voice broke--Rally felt a throb of lonliness and wanted to kiss that person.&quot; So she hooks up with Patrick Rigg, who makes it a point NOT to kiss women, and has an &quot;affair&quot; with her that can only be described as  narcissistic and sado-masochistic.  This in itself is no problem to the general tone of this book.  The main flaw is what Shickler does with the Patrick Rigg character and this I feel almost  ruins the last portion of the book except for the saving grace in the character and persona of Thomas Merchant. Shickler puts Patrick Rigg on a pseudo &quot;American Psycho&quot; course that doesn't jive with what has come before in the previous stories nor in the natural progression of Rigg's character.  But he saves himself and his book with Thomas Merchant: &quot;he was not handsome, articulate or muscular.&quot; Thomas serves as Shickler's deus ex machina in more than one way: he saves the day and runs interference when Patrick Rigg runs amok and he saves the book from going over the edge into shlock.  Shickler is the real thing, a genuine talent.  I await the novel with anticipation.xcept for the saving grace in the character and persona of Thomas Merchant.

It is written in the tradition of a Flaneur which means Mr. White must comment on all that he sees and hears and knows about those areas in Paris on which he chooses to comment. Based on several novels and and non-fiction books he has written(White was made a Chevalier de l'ordre des Arts et Lettres by the French government for &quot;Genet: A Biography&quot;)and by the fact he lived in Paris for a number of years he certainly posseses the goods to do justice to his subject.  And indeed he does.  This short book is crammed full of all sorts of interesting facts about Paris some of which seem to get people's dander up.  But my answer to them is:  GROW UP!  A fine, well written insightful PERSONAL account of the streets and byways of Paris.  Bravo Mr. White.	2001-07-30
US	48497303	R3SFGX9XBDHFDB	0743411323	184600193	Never Change	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A dream fulfilled........	Elizabeth Berg's &quot;Never Change&quot; is a Fairy Tale; a story about what happens when we dare to dream and the remarkable circumstances that occur when our dreams can and do come true.  The very first lines of the novel ache with longing and dreams unfulfilled:  &quot;You know people like me.  I'm the one who sat on a chair out in the hall with a cigar box on my lap, selling tickets to the prom but never going....But I would have happily gone...happily put on the wrist corsage.  I wanted an hour to allow for the application of all my new Maybelline, suffer the flash bulbs of my parents' eager camera..... I didn't get asked.  I never once got asked.  Not to proms, not to lesser dances, not to movies, not to paties, not for shopping with the girls.&quot; The narrator is a traveling nurse, Myra Lypinski.  And whether or not we know a traveling nurse we all have known or now know a Myra Lypinski.  It's good old Myra always there with the food or a smile or a shoulder to cry on or to listen to our problems. But author Elizabeth Berg has a different fate in mind for Myra.  One that makes Myra happy if only for a short while.  There are shades of &quot;Marty&quot; and shades of many of Anne Tyler's characters in Myra.  In fact Myra suggest an Anne Tyler novel to one of her patients.  Her patient responds...&quot;but the characters are so weird,&quot; which gives Myra a chuckle and we chuckle also. The end of the novel falls apart I think due to a hurried ending.  But there is so much beautiful, haunting prose to be had in &quot;Never Change&quot; that you won't care much.  &quot;Never Change&quot; is about the dream you dare to dream and never hope to fulfill.  But sometimes life will throw you a curve and you will get what you ask for and it will be good.	2001-07-27

Alexandra Styron's \\"All the Finest Girls\\" is a slight novel with touches of some genuinely fine writing most of which comes at the end when the story has unfolded and the main character Addy is evaluating her life and that of her parents and her beloved nanny, Lou. At times in this novel Ms. Styron suffers from what I call \\"TonyMorrisonization\\" which translates as:  make the prose so dense and so convoluted that it must be read at least twice to understand it. Oh yes, and flash forward and back as many times as possible(hence the allusion to a movie script in the title of my review).  ...  All and All a good first novel.  Ms. Styron is talented and I look forward to her second effort.	2001-07-22

All Haruki Murakami readers are at a disadvantage I think when they read his novels in translation as the translator stands in between Murakami and his readers.  How much of Murakami do we really &quot;get?&quot;  This thought was running through my head while I read &quot;Sputnik Sweetheart,&quot; a very simple and straight forward novel.  A novel with little for me in which to sink my teeth.  Which is not to say that SS was not mildly diverting and nicely written or re-written by Phillip Gabriel.  But a major Murakami novel or one with high-toned intentions and thoughts...? No not at all.  What &quot;Sputnik Sweetheart&quot; is is a very high quality beach or pool novel.  And in that sense it succeeds admirably.	2001-07-21

I would guess that the idea of &quot;novelizing&quot; an actual event seemed like a good one to Cambor but in her hands this effort falls flat even though there are some beautifully written passages as in Julia's thoughts after the death of 2 of her children:  &quot;..the charm, the tenderness, the wit she'd always counted on, that her mother always said were part of her good character, had disappeared like so much smoke.  She was left hollowed, fractured, parched.&quot; What I'm saying is that Kathleen Cambor is a fine writer but her talents are not suited to this particular subject.  What happens is, because there is so much exposition needed to propell this story, that Cambor's talent is squandered. &quot;In the Sunlight in a Beautiful Garden&quot; is a noble failure but a failure nonetheless.	2001-07-21
US	48497303	R2ZWTI77IVZM8J	0393020363	211821642	The Miracle Life of Edgar Mint	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Holden Caufield Redux	Any novel that begins with the lines:  &quot;If I could tell you only one thing about my life it would be this: when I was seven years old the mailman ran over my head...&quot; has got me interested. Brady Udall ices the cake with a ragtag group of characters that contribute much to make this novel as satisfying as it becomes in the course of its' 400+ pages. In the tradition of authors like Henry Fielding (Tom Jones), Frank Mc Court (little Francis) and J.D. Salinger(Holden Caufied) comes Barry Udall's Edgar Mint. And like these others &quot;The Miracle Life of Edgar Mint&quot; caused me to laugh out loud and to ultimately care and respond to Edgar and his search for love and his place in the world. Udall plots the novel in the picaresque tradition as Edgar sets off on a journey and comes in contact with many people; some good for him, some not.  But he always survives and he always perserveres. It is this survivor's instinct that we most admire and frankly grow to love in Edgar. The novel goes on too long but this is a minor transgression in what is really being accomplished here: Udall gets us to care about and feel protective of little Edgar.  And when was the last time you could say this about any novel old or new?	2001-07-19
