Is entertaining and just the right mix of legal matters, mystery, and personal feelings and happenings for young judge Deborah, who, I marvel, is the 12th child of Kezzie Knott, born after his 11 sons.  Kezzie, one of the more memorable characters (a backwoods moonshiner with a high intellect and a legendary family) makes a brief appearance at the end of the story, as Deborah finally ties the knot with deputy Dwight Bryant.<br /><br />Maron skillfully mixes the wedding (with all the trimmings) while digging in to interlocking crimes. One is the sad murder of a local Assistant DA, one a long-ago murder by a woman who is now on death row.  Both Dwight and Deborah get caught in the underpinnings, and effectively work together...going up a blind alley until the truth presents itself.<br /><br />Maron's stories of North Carolina, where she's a native, draw you in and make you feel as though you are there.  Her heroine is charming and wise, and the stories just keep getting better.  It will be interesting to see where Maron takes the series now that Deborah has a new role in life.<br /><br />A great read!	2005-10-10

This is the 16th novel in the work of John Sandford (aka as journalist John Camp) that follows the adventures of a Minneapolis cop named Lucas Davenport. The series, running since 1989, is known as the \\"Prey\\" series, for the repetition of the word in the title. Davenport is an unorthodox cop-software creator-home builder, who has made a fortune and chose to follow his mentor from the Minneapolis police department to the Minnesota Bureau of Crime Apprehension.<br /><br />Davenport's new infant son, Sam, Davenport's police cronies, his surgeon wife, Weather, and a ward they have taken in, Letty West, are also featured in the series but have little to do in this particular installment. This book is difficult to read as a stand alone, without some background from the prior books.<br /><br />\\"Broken Prey\\" harkens back to some of Sandford's early work in that the killing, introduced immediately, is brutal and nightmarish. A young college student. Angela Larson, is murdered in Minneapolis and slashed horribly. Both Sister Mary Joseph, hero Lucas Davenport's longtime friend and psychologist extraordinaire, and Lucas get involved with the case to help Detective Sloan of the Mpls. PD. They are running leads and getting frustrated when the killer strikes again.<br /><br />In a smallish Minnesota city, a man and his young son are killed in the same brutal manner. The signature signs of the crime are unmistakable and linked to the Larson killing in Minneapolis. Now the clock ticks, because the team realizes the violence of a psychopath grows and his episodes of killing come faster as his frenzy escalates. Lucas throws himself at the case, while his family is on hiatus in England.<br /><br />Sex offenders come under scrutiny, and the chief suspect among them is Charlie Pope, who just got out of prison. But, while most signs point to Pope, Lucas suspects that the conclusion is wrong - the killer is extremely intelligent, and the pursuit of Charlie Pope leaves no room for doubt that Charlie doesn't play with a full deck.<br /><br />In typical Sandford tradition, we go back into the mind of Charlie Pope from time to time throughout the novel, getting an insider's feel for all those conflicting reasons why Charlie might not be the perpetrator. Throughout the story, a wayward reporter named Ruffee Ignace keeps getting drawn into the investigation by calls from the killer. And, in an interesting, Hannibal Lecter-type twist, \\"The Big Three\\" or \\"The Gods Down The Hall\\" finally surface. These are 3 prisoners from Isolation in the prison that Charlie Pope's been released from. Their crimes are macabre, and, while there is no death penalty in Minnesota, they are held in Death row type circumstances. How are they influencing the murders?<br /><br />In a final series of violent chapters, with the action escalating as the killer sinks deeper into madness, Sandford finally brings his brutal thriller to a halt, and once again, Lucas takes a bullet. Despite that, his team is able to make sure that the killings stop, because the killer is stopped.<br /><br />In the aftermath and cleanup, the reader gets to return, in a clever twist, to the biggest mystery in the book, the one that Lucas keeps going back to when things get too intense, namely: what are the 100 greatest songs of the rock era? Lucas wants them on his new ipod. This signature \\"time out\\" for normalcy truly sets a Sandford story apart, and the list is pretty good, for a list without the Beatles, that is.or doubt that Charlie doesn't play with a full deck.  <br /> <br />In typical Sandford tradition, we go back into the mind of Charlie Pope from time to time throughout the novel, getting an insider's feel for all those conflicting reasons why Charlie might not be the perpetrator.

Lee Child's main character, Jack Reacher, is the modern day equivalent of a gunslinger.  The idea of a man of honor, who served honorably and well in the military of his country, coming back to roam the country unfettered by traditional lifestyles or bonds....well, it makes for compelling plotting (and takes me back to my childhood, with all those westerns in black and white).  I've been a fan since the beginning of this series, despite Child's early lack of in depth research and some significant editing problems.  In this, Reacher's 9th outing, the newest book, \\"One Shot\\", Child serves up more delicious action as Reacher is drawn into a small city incident of what appears to be terrorism.<br /><br />The sniper shoots and kills six people.  He takes few pains at hiding his identity, and he's picked up in a police probe that is a slam dunk.  The evidence against him is so compelling that only his sister holds out any hope for the fact that he is innocent.  Reacher doesn't want to save him.  He arrives on the scene to cement the thought that the man is capable of such an act, citing an earlier act of conduct while in the military that seems to echo in the current shootings.  But it doesn't take long for Reacher to become uncomfortable with the circumstances, and with the clumsy efforts of some force, some unknown powers who are framing the sniper and running scared that Reacher will find out.<br /><br />The climax of the story is without parallel, and, once again, Reacher compels the reader by both his various \\"tough guy\\" idiosyncrasies and his ability to extricate himself and others from tense and action packed situations.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong, the villains in question are way over the top, both in their plotting and in their identities and foibles.  That's pretty much stock in trade for the foes that Reacher comes across in his pursuit of living an anonymous life of a crime buster in these United States.  And while Child won't win any awards for his prose, he is, without a doubt, a master of mounting tension and that ephemeral quality of writing so compelling that the book can't be put down.  One of the best in this nine book series, you'll enjoy \\"One Shot\\" whether you've run across Reacher before, or not.  If you haven't read the series, this book may lead you to do just that.<br /><br />Enjoy!any awards for his prose, he is, without a doubt, a master of mounting tension and that ephemeral quality of writing so compelling that the book can't be put down.

Somehow, the concept of \\"cold cases\\" has become fashionable....we see the theme on television in various guises, and author Edna Buchanan has launched a strong second series based in Miami on a Cold Case unit.  Who better to be involved in deep research and instinct that it takes for a cold case than Michael Connelly's perennial hero, Hieronymous (Harry) Bosch.  Retired from the force in the last two series books, Bosch is restless and needs to get back to what he does best, being a cop.  His former partner, Kizmin Rider, has positioned herself in the department to get the assignment she wants, as a detective in the Open-Unsolved Unit in L.A.  Her influence allows her to insure she can draw Bosch back in with her.<br /><br />It was 1988 when 16 year-old Rebecca Verloren disappeared.  Of mixed race, Becky was a complex young woman, and her family dissolved as a result of the tragedy.  Kiz and Harry find that her mother has preserved every bit of Becky's room as it was 17 years before, and her father has given up and is drifting, homeless, in the city.  DNA testing has matched skin tissue found on the murder weapon to Roland Mackey, who was 18 at the time of the crime, but can't be linked to the victim.  There's a police commander who might be a possible suspect - his involvement is linked to long-time corruption in the LAPD; something that makes Bosch's blood boil.<br /><br />Bringing Harry back to the department, and back to partnership with Kiz Rider was inspired.  Connelly spends the vast majority of the book in intricate plotting and unraveling.  There are too few moments where we get to glimpse into Bosch's dark moods - the patter about his worries being a father notwithstanding.  But with \\"The Closers\\" Connelly has set the stage to push his certerpiece, Bosch, into the overwhelming amount of unclosed murder cases in LA...someone to \\"speak for the chorus of missing voices\\".  And I'm sure that, in future novels, this chorus will haunt Bosch and bring us back into Connelly's ability to pace the reader through the dark and tormented thoughts and memories of Harry Bosch.<br /><br />Definitely worth a read, and an important \\"link\\" in the Bosch series, buy, \\"The Closers\\".ly's ability to pace the reader through the dark and tormented thoughts and memories of Harry Bosch. <br /> <br />Definitely worth a read, and an important \\"link\\" in the Bosch series, buy, \\"The Closers\\".   <br />	2005-09-03

In telling his tales, he uses some of the strongest writing skills in this recent memory. Crisp, clear, he gives you his vision; he writes of a time that is so quietly horrific, that the reader knows that war is never worth it. Anything that gives rise to these thoughts, these events, the way in which war washes over an entire generation and sweeps it under, well...enough.<br /><br />If you only read one book about the Viet Nam experience, make it this one.<br /><br />\\"By slighting death, by acting, we pretended it was not the terrible thing it was....we transformed the bodies into piles of waste.  Thus, when someone got killed, his body was not really a body, but rather one small bit of waste, in the midst of much wider wastage....\\"<br /><br />There are not enough stars to rate this book.

Elvis Cole dwells in the past in this, Robert Crais' 10th novel featuring the \\"world's greatest detective\\". And while Crais' readers love the wise-cracking detective, many of us read the series as much for Joe Pike, his scary, warrior-like back up system. Tough turn, then, that Pike is merely an afterthought in this book.<br /><br />Taking up much of the slack is Carol Starkey, the alcoholic, former bomb-squad detective who starred in Crais' \\"Demolition Angel\\" and met up with Elvis in \\"The Last Detective\\". Carol's having strong romantic feelings for Elvis, but he's not ready for a new love yet, still licking his wounds from the breakup with former paramour Lucy and her son Ben, who appear briefly.<br /><br />The story allows the reader to break into the murky past of Elvis, when a man is shot, who has been looking for his son. As a child, Elvis was on an endless quest to discover the identity of his father; his mother suffered from an emotional disorder and his grandparents could hardly restrain his need to wander, to try to find himself. He's had a rough childhood, and the possibility that the dead man is his father draws him out of a depression and into the mainstream of the police investigation. During the track of the novel, a character named Frederick, a paranoid schizophrenic, lurks in the background, convinced that Cole was responsible for the death of his friend Payne.<br /><br />As his search for the truth about the dead man evolves, Cole starts to shed light on a cold case, rediscovering his power to energetically pursue answers as he buries himself in his work. A little oblivious to Starkey's feelings, Cole is nevertheless drawn to her by mutual need on the case, and by the recognition that she's another tortured soul. Elvis may be the wittiest of today's detectives in this genre, but Crais proves here that he's not just witty, lucky and likeable, he's also the product of his past.<br /><br />Although \\"The Forgotten Man\\" is not nearly the book \\"The Last Detective\\" was, Crais continues to disarm his readers and keeps the series alive.<br /><br />There's some complexity here, and some surprises at the end, and Crais fans will be begging for more Elvis Cole when the story concludes. For my money, any real 5 star Elvis Cole story will also bring more action and reaction with the inclusion of the volatile Joe Pike in the story.<br /><br />Recommended for fans who like their thrillers in series, but read the earlier books first.\\"The Last Detective\\" was, Crais continues to disarm his readers and keeps the series alive. <br /> <br />There's some complexity here, and some surprises at the end, and Crais fans will be begging for more Elvis Cole when the story concludes.

Evanovich brings Stephanie back and leaves some of the more tedious characters in her stable (sister Valerie, Albert Kloughn, Vinnie) in small cameos.  Stephanie is acting like more of a grown up by deciding to quit a job that has little future and sketchy money.  It's hilarious to see just how far down the ladder she'll go to be employed after her first stab at an office job doesn't work out....she actually goes to work for Cluck in a Bucket, complete with chicken headgear.  Finally, a job that can showcase Steph's nose for a mystery rears its head when Ranger offers her a job.<br /><br />Evanovich recaptures the fun of the play off between Steph/Morelli and Steph/Ranger.  She showcases the irony of Lula working as a bounty hunter with Steph as her sidekick.  She pinpoints Stephanie's sugar addiction and we get to see what happens to Steph's hormones when the sugar is gone.  Great fights between Steph and Morelli's grandmas, some showcasing of Steph's dad (who really has his hands full with the women in his life), some goofy rituals with Stephanie dressing in black to work for Ranger, and a satisfying but surprising villain, who has been around in the background of all these books....and who woulda thunk he was evil?<br /><br />A mad jumble of fun and loose ends, a great beach book, a fast read.

US	45979403	R38APDBCAATXWU	0670033944	748214467	The Mermaid Chair: A Novel	Books	4	6	9	N	Y	Evaluating this novel for itself, and not vs. predecessor,	I found it to be beautifully written, and evocative of Kidd's themes:  the bonds of friendship among women of different races, ages and backgrounds, the mystical rituals that abound in small southern havens, and the feelings of loss and loneliness when one person is cut off from their roots and the family ties they have previously cherished.<br /><br />Kidd's heroine in this, her sophomore effort, is Jessie Sullivan, a middle aged artist who is restless and feels cut off from both her family (husband and college-age daughter) after the trio has been exceptionally close during Dee's life as a child, and her own family roots.  Her mother still lives on the fictional barrier island, Egret, off the coast of South Carolina, amongst colorful friends and near a monastery steeped in tradition.  Jessie, however, has not been to the island in many years.<br /><br />Called home by a tragic act of her mother (who has cut off her own finger, by design, and not by accident), Jessie uses the excuse of going to Egret to escape the doldrums of a marriage to Hugh, who has no idea that she is restless and unhappy.<br /><br />Kidd gives us the rural traditions of life on the island, steeped in the culture of a mysterious and gaudy mermaid chair, upon which the tourist trinkets are based.  Her mother's oldest friends, Kat and Hepzibah, are still there on the island, and her mother, up until the accident, has continued to cook for the monks at the Benedictine monastery.  Jessie's memories, however, skip lightly over her mother, and are full of her brother Mike and her father, who died in a boat tragedy when the two were still young.  Jessie and Mike had watched their mother fall further and further into religious fervor after his death, and both had avoided the island as much as possible when becoming adults.<br /><br />Over the course of the next months, Jessie sort of absent-mindedly cares for her mother, whose emotional state is frailer than her physical problem.  But her real goals seem to be getting to the bottom of the real reason her father died, along with pursuing a relationship with Brother Thomas (formerly an attorney named Whit, whose wife and unborn child also died in a tragic accident).  Drawn together by physical chemistry and shared sorrow, Jessie and Thomas have an affair that resonates through Thomas' belief in God and the path he has chosen.<br /><br />Interrupted by another senseless act of her mother's, Jessie is led to the truth about her father's death, led to face up to the destruction she has wreaked on her marriage, and finally led to really paying attention to what type of guilt and legend is causing her mother to behave so erratically.<br /><br />Kidd's description of Egret Island, and her flashbacks to the tales of Jessie and Mike's childhood are written beautifully.  The intimacy between Thomas and Jessie is tasteful and evocative.  But Kidd cannot use the charm of Jessie's character to overcome the self-absorption she portrays, nor can she draw us into the Mermaid legend in the way that she used the spirit of beekeeping in the former novel.  The ending to her tale is likewise, unsatisfying.  And it is unforgiveable that the lovely people on this island, who all know the secret of Jessie's father's death, would keep enough of it from her to let her believe that the fire in which he died was caused by the pipe that she gave him.  In this senseless act, they allow her to live with the guilt throughout most of her adolescent and adult life.  One cannot believe that any of the islanders, who obviously care about Jessie, would do so, no matter that this is what her mother wants.<br /><br />And so, Kidd gives us a flawed tale -- one, it's true,  in which her ability to weave words and describe settings of real southern beauty and charm is unmatched.  But the characters in the book play false, and the love affair, and its ending, leave a sense of shabbiness.  The central myths of the tale, of strong and Catholic faith surrounding the tale of the Mermaid, are not really believable as written.<br /><br />The Mermaid Chair draws you in and keeps your interest, but the vague sense of unease that the reader has throughout the tale of an unsettled, middle-aged woman, are not in keeping with the beauty of the writing.<br /><br />Somewhere between 3 and 4 stars (when not comparing it to the Secret Life of Bees!), this book was perhaps conceived too quickly for Monk Kidd to find human themes that fit her mystical premise.ong and Catholic faith surrounding the tale of the Mermaid, are not really believable as written.   <br /> <br />The Mermaid Chair draws you in and keeps your interest, but the vague sense of unease that the reader has throughout the tale of an unsettled, middle-aged woman, are not in keeping with the beauty of the writing.   <br /> <br />Somewhere between 3 and 4 stars (when not comparing it to the Secret Life of Bees!), this book was perhaps conceived too quickly for Monk Kidd to find human themes that fit her mystical premise.	2005-05-02

In her newest, \\"Baker Towers\\", Haigh uses the same literary tool, of telling the story from the point of view of three women, this time sisters.  Her setting is western Pennsylvania, an ethnic town in the mining boom following World War II.  Setting and characters, the Novak family, are interesting and fresh.  Born of a Polish father and an Italian mother, a rare combination in a world anchored in ethnic closeness, the Novaks are not well off, and even more distressed financially when their father dies. Haigh portrays Mrs. Novak as a typical woman of the time, who flounders when her husband is gone.<br /><br />Sons Georgie and Sandy make quick escapes from Bakerton.  Neither has the disposition it takes to settle in and work the mines.  Daughters Dorothy, Joyce, and young Lucy, who comes of age in this book stay in Bakerton, after brief sojourns elsewhere.  Haigh gives Lucy a thorough characterization, as a late in life baby, beloved and spoiled, raised without a father, and going through all of the difficulties of adolescence, only to eventually find herself with someone who has been right there, under her nose all along.<br /><br />Joyce, the middle sister, is the caretaker.  Practical and smart, she resigns herself to an ordinary life spent making sure that her family survives.  In many ways, the choices Joyce makes and the loss of her personality as she devotes herself to first her mother, then her sisters, and finally to the man she marries out of familiarily leave questions in the reader's mind.  Was there no way for someone with Joyce's spirit and intelligence to stay in Bakerton but blossom into a town leader, a woman of purpose?  It is quite possible that Haigh's truth is what might have really happened...that a woman like Joyce, given the times and the responsibilities, may have well faded into gray.<br /><br />Dorothy is truly a puzzle.  Leaving to work in Washington, she seems as though she is truly a free spirit.  But the city breaks her, and she returns to Bakerton as a lonely and needy pale shade of her former self.  Dorothy lives the life she wants, but what made her break down?  The reason is never clear from Haigh's tale.<br /><br />All this said, although Haigh begins with interesting characters and premise, her story never delivers in the way \\"Mrs. Kimble\\" did.  And, as other readers have commented, Haigh's research into the area and the timeframe she writes about is flawed.  She makes both geographical and timeframe errors, hurting the historical context of the book.<br /><br />All in all, Haigh remains a promising young writer, but this, her second book, needed more polish and work before it was published.<br /><br />Worth a read, but wait for the paperback.ms as though she is truly a free spirit.

Much time has passed since John Fowles, now a major international author, first wrote and published \\"The Collector\\", in 1963.  In many ways, it was the prequel to a myriad of psychological thrillers (by other writers) involving obsession.  Fowles, an enormous success based on this, his first novel, has gone on to a distinguished career and writing that is far more complex and layered than what we encounter here.<br /><br />That said, reading \\"The Collector\\", one cannot help but be impressed at how Fowles sets the story, and how the point of view of the reader is rather voyeuristic -- we see the entire plot by reading the journals of the two protagonists, peering into a series of events they share by contrasting point of view.<br /><br />Fowles leads us into the story through the eyes of Ferdinand Clegg, a clerk who wins a sum of money in \\"the pools\\".  He sends his odd relatives off on a global jaunt, and uses the bulk of the money to buy a lonely cottage with a cellar that he turns into a secure prison of sorts.  The object of his attention is a young and vibrant art student named Miranda.  All his life Clegg (or Caliban, as Miranda dubs him) has collected butterflies. He now means to use his skills as a hunter, curator and collector, to possess Miranda, whom he has been stalking for several months.<br /><br />In the plotting that is Clegg's, Fowles is remarkably detached from the world, helping his readers see it from the slightly oppressed viewpoint of the British middle class; only Clegg has thoughts and needs suppressed for many years, that are frightening in their focused simplicity.  Of the capture of Miranda, Clegg relates:<br /><br />\\"It finally ten days later happened as it sometimes does with butterflies.  I mean you go to a place where you know you may see something rare and you don't, but the next time not looking for it you see it on a flower right in front of you, handed to you on a plate, as they say.\\"<br /><br />In reading Clegg's story, the reader feels touched, albeit briefly, by his madness, which is wrapped in the coat of a lonely young man.<br /><br />The second part of the book allows the reader to come to know Miranda, through her secret journal.  As vibrant as Clegg is dull, Miranda has been very caught up in the life of an artist, including her college dabbling with a teacher-type paramour, known to the reader as \\"G.P.\\".  Much of what is absorbing in Miranda's world ceases with her capture.  Her portion of the tale is a struggle with the alternating fear and loathing of Caliban, and the instinctive need to understand him, so that she might use that understanding to seek her freedom.  Her faith in God ebbing, her despair and disdain for her captor growing, Miranda's shattered by her captivity.  She says of him:<br /><br />\\"He's not human; he's an empty space disguised as a human.\\"<br /><br />Inevitably, at the close of the captivity, the end of the story is told by Caliban, detached from the role he plays in how Miranda's story ends.  Freshly shocked from this, the reader begins Chapter 4 unsettled, only to find that Caliban has disconnected from what he's done, and is preparing to do it again by stalking a young girl named Marian.  It is this reopening of the cycle of violence and oppression that truly makes your blood run cold, truly introduces you to the brilliance that is Fowles' as a writer.<br /><br />Your Fowles bookshelf is incomplete without \\"The Collector\\".

Beautifully typeset, with a particular attractiveness in how each paragraph and chapter is introduced, Broadway did its best for Jane Green.<br /><br />The story is a series of interrelated vignettes about cosmopolitan women settling into the motherhood thing.  \\"Sam\\", the last of the vignettes, is perhaps the only realistic story of the three.  Although it does end happily, \\"Sam\\" illustrates the true lack of self that many new mothers have.  Not the post partum blues, but beyond that, the loss of individuality that comes with motherhood; the feeling that Sam has lost herself and her sexuality.  In this vignette, Sam falls hard for the husband of a friend and gets wrapped up in a rotten little game he's playing.<br /><br />Sam is friends with Maeve and Julia, the \\"stars\\" of the first two tales.  Julia's story begins with the harsh reality of the long-term career woman who cannot conceive.  This is a tale that needs telling -- how devastating this can be for both the man and the woman in the effort.  How wanting something this badly, and not being able to have it can destroy a relationship.  But, somewhat unrealistically, there really was no good foundation for Julia's need to be a mother.  She's not really in love or \\"in like\\" with her partner, Mark.  She escapes to NYC, and there goes on to live a successful life, 180 degrees removed from what she thought she wanted.  Julia's hard to like, and the flip flop from the fixation on having a baby to being the sexy single loose in Manhattan...well, it's too hard to believe.<br /><br />Maeve has a lot going for her.  She's beautiful, successful, likeable -- but her own \\"event\\", the conception of her pregnancy, is totally horrendous.  A single sex act in an alley?<br /><br />This, for a rich, charming, beautiful career woman?  And it's followed by an eventual relationship with the man who \\"took her\\" that night, cohabitating and parenting with her.  Drivel.<br /><br />Give \\"Sam\\" 5 stars and \\"Julia\\" and \\"Maeve\\" 2 stars, and you end up with something mediocre that will sell well because Jane Green has developed a following and has a way of turning a phrase.  But Babyville is form over substance.  You may or may not enjoy it....probably more so if you are trying to conceive or have gone thru some post-partum issues in recent times.too hard to believe. <br /> <br />Maeve has a lot going for her.

Author Sherrie Martin is an acquaintance of mine, and she is a talented writer of essays and poetry.  In this, her first novel of fiction, she introduces you to a world of southern women who can outcharm and outdo the Ya-Ya girls for outrageousness.<br /><br />Martin's heroine, Jenny, has let her annoyance with her husband get the better of her, and she's winged him with her gun.  He's forgiven her, knowing she's a little volatile, and is even acting as her defense attorney!  In getting ready for her trial, Jenny lets us take the time to get introduced to the other crazies (mother and sisters) in her family, her lovely daughter and some of the town's denizens -- southern women to die for!<br /><br />The linchpin of the women's society in the fictional town of Angel Path, Virginia, is the elegant lady dress shop.<br /><br />Martin's unique vision for the book encompasses details about each woman's shopping and choice of ensemble for the trial.  In doing this, the couture helps the reader understand the motivation of each character.  It's a clever way for the reader to get inside their heads, but Martin's dialogue leaves no room for doubt, that this is the south at its best!<br /><br />Possibly overlooked in the novel is Martin's gift for prose instead of dialogue, with the description of the incomparable Blue Ridge Mountains, in which the town is nestled, does not take a back seat to the story.<br /><br />Although the novel does jump around a little in it's introduction of setting and townsfolk, Martin truly finds her voice and keeps things crisp, clear, and animated in Jenny's trial.  A family secret is revealed as the trial progresses, that is in keeping with Jenny's family's dysfunctionality.  The final verdict is realistic and rings true, and you'll find yourself at the close of the book, wondering just what is going on in Angel Path this month.<br /><br />A great beginning for novelist Martin, a good gift for any southern woman in your life!	2004-12-27

Tucker's daughter Kat, at 14, is in the throes of this hormonal madness, and he doesn't even know it.  Tucker's an oddity, a father who has won primary custody of daughter and son when his former wife moved up the social ladder and mostly out of their lives.<br /><br />It's hard not to like Tucker, who's a self-made man, with a love for music and a need to be there for his children.  It is with some trepidation that we watch him turn to rage when Kat is involved in a sex scandal at the home of a boy he knows nothing about.  In slow motion, his rage leads to injury and disfigurement of the boy, and incarceration and trial. But his trials are many, both in trying to understand and protect his daughter, keep his younger son from fear, his love for his best friend's wife at bay, and himself from going mad.<br /><br />The strain of parenting adolescents in this mixed up world is brought to the fore in Kat's tale, and although it is written in first person from Tucker's point of view, there is no doubt that author Stephen Goodwin was able to get inside the heads of all his main characters...from children Kat and Will to the amazing Lilly, from Trish, his ex-wife who attempts to preserve her motherhood from the tragedy, to the teenaged Jed Vandenberg, with a permanent scar from a heated misunderstanding.  Goodwin makes them all come alive on the page.  And he does more, something more, that, for me, brings the book to life - he brings in the ordinary; talks about the what the notes on his refrigerator say, talks about the demise of his marriage, has a remarkable reaction (like many of us) to the first time he hears the beautiful songs of the posthumous Eva Cassidy CD, \\"Songbird\\".  ...\\"as I danced with my daughter, her eyes searching mine, the two of us just floating, I felt something give way inside of me....as though all our old love, every particle of it, had been restored to us by the music we were hearing.\\"<br /><br />As my own daughter grew up, I remember times of anger and despair that seemed like an out of body experience, and so it is with Tucker... in describing his violent reaction to young Jed Vandenburg, at a time where he had no idea where his 14-year old daughter was and if she was all right...\\"I can remember how the air seemed to stiffen and tighten, how every word and tiny gesture took on a huge significance, and how the hair on the back of my neck suddenly bristled\\".<br /><br />Goodwin is a writer of style and grace, his book a revelation and a scare for parents and adolescents, a book that will stay with you longer than the details of the story itself.<br /><br />A definite must read!assidy CD, \\"Songbird\\".  ...\\"as I danced with my daughter, her eyes searching mine, the two of us just floating, I felt something give way inside of me....as though all our old love, every particle of it, had been restored to us by the music we were hearing.\\" <br /> <br />As my own daughter grew up, I remember times of anger and despair that seemed like an out of body experience, and so it is with Tucker... in describing his violent reaction to young Jed Vandenburg, at a time where he had no idea where his 14-year old daughter was and if she was all right...\\"I can remember how the air seemed to stiffen and tighten, how every word and tiny gesture took on a huge significance, and how the hair on the back of my neck suddenly bristled\\". <br /> <br />Goodwin is a writer of style and grace, his book a revelation and a scare for parents and adolescents, a book that will stay with you longer than the details of the story itself. <br /> <br />A definite must read! <br />	2004-12-27
US	45979403	R22SDIN2KY6UO4	0399152121	353495031	The Confession	Books	5	27	32	N	Y	Siegel is back with the entertaining, "The Confession"!	Sheldon Siegel does it again, in his fifth and newest outing for San Francisco attorney and ex-priest Mike Daley.  The book opens with Daley's confession to one of his best friends, priest Ramon Aguirre.  Before it closes, Daley, Aguirre, and the normal cast of characters in a Siegel novel (Mike's ex-wife and law partner Rosie, their various relatives, \\"McNasty\\", the lead prosecutor in the DA's office, Banks and Johnson, a crack SFPD homicide team and the Catholic diocese of San Francisco) will come and go, but the bond between Mike and Ramon will grow due to Daley's defense of Father Aguirre in a murder trial.<br /><br />In his investigation of what really happened to the victim, Siegel shares with us a slice of her life, in flashbacks - she's a close friend and former teenage fling of Aguirre's, and another fixture in the neighborhood, crusading attorney Maria Concepcion.  In a pace too fast for many readers, Siegel introduces us to everyone of relevance in Maria's life, and one by one, eliminates them from the crime.  The book, as in many of Siegel's former novels, climaxes in the courtroom, this time in a preliminary hearing.  Of little help is the fact that Father Aguirre feeds the defense team information little by little, confirming the damning information about his relationship with the victim only after they have learned about it from the police. Although this fact is grating on the reader, Siegel's fans will be more than satisfied with a couple of characteristics of his writing, which have become his signature.<br /><br />The first is Daley's mental corrections of nearly everything he says that is politically correct.  When queried by the higher ups in the church's in-house legal counsel, \\"I trust you will provide full disclosure of all relevant information?\\"...Daley's response of \\"Of course.\\" Is prefaced by his real answer, which is never enunciated...\\"We'll see\\".  Throughout the book, the dichotomy of Daley's out-loud answers and his mental gymnastics is an entertaining Siegel tradition.  One of the other Siegel signatures is his prefacing of each chapter with a brief blurb or quote from a publication (such as the San Francisco Chronicle) about the case he's working on.  This technique pulls the reader into the context of the story within the boundaries of SF, and makes it come alive.  Some examples?<br /><br />When Daley's offices are destroyed by a fire that is apparently arson, and when the church withdraws its support as co-counsel, chapter 43 begins with \\"Mr. Daley and Ms. Fernandez should ask for a continuance...Legal Commentator Mort Goldberg, Channel 4 News, Monday, December 15, 8:30 a.m.\\"  After having this priest charged with the murder of an attorney that was suing another priest for sexual misconduct, after learning that Father Aguirre donated sperm to help the victim become pregnant, and after the dirty tricks played by the SF Diocese's legal team against the victim come out in court, Chapter 51 begins with a quote from its chief in-house counsel, Francis X. Quinn, \\"We have to avoid any appearance of impropriety.\\"....an understatement if there ever was one.<br /><br />I hope the broader reading community that enjoys thrillers, both legal and mystery, doesn't ever discover Siegel's books in a big way, because that will put more pressure on him to produce the commercially acceptable; in the meantime, he can just continue with his penchant for a great yarn, with a cast of memorable characters, and a sweeping humor that doesn't undermine the thriller aspects of his writing.

Always colorful and entertaining, Toole's novel delights, although, in my opinion, it fell short of what standard I believe should be achieved for a Pulitzer.<br /><br />Hundreds of reviewers can't be wrong - read \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\", particularly if you've ever lived in the deep south!	2004-11-26

In THAT book, which may seem ordinary today, Isaacs broke<br /><br />a lot of rules.  She wrote about the suburban mom vs. working woman in a manner that poked fun at both.  She let her heroine have an adulterous fling, and, somehow, it seemed<br /><br />all right in a day and age when the sexual revolution was just something hippies were involved in.  Over the years, in nine novels (ten, now!) Isaacs has given me much pleasure and literally has me stop and say more than once throughout each book-\\"that's happened to me...\\".  My personal favorite of Isaac's novels is \\"After All These Years\\", but, then, I never met an Isaacs novel I didn't love.<br /><br />I credit Susan Isaacs with starting the \\"chick lit\\" era, and she is a master.  Her novels don't just make light of women facing issues, they generally are themed for a woman who is just discovering a whole lot about herself that she never knew.  \\"Any Place I Hang My Hat\\" is no exception, although the heroine, Amy Lincoln (a 30-something Jewish-Italian New Yorker from the slums, with a missing mother who walked off and left her and a father (\\"Chicky\\") who has lived a life incarcerated, on and off)doesn't realize right away that she's destined to try to find her true self.<br /><br />Naturally, Amy's used her wits and her knack for hard work and fitting in to go first to an exclusive boarding school, all expenses paid, then on to Harvard and Columbia to study journalism.  She's a political writer for \\"In Depth\\" - a quality magazine with an educated following, and she's been involved for more than two years with a documentary<br /><br />filmmaker, John Orenstein.  She's got a longer relationship, for a decade and a half,  with rich, exotic Tatty, her best<br /><br />friend.  The two met in boarding school when Tatty insulted her and Amy retaliated by punching her in the mouth.  Tatty naturally does not have to work for a living, but chose a career in gourmet occasion cake making, after her two marriages failed.  Isaacs normally draws me in with a more middle-aged heroine, but in the brilliant little journey that Amy makes to find herself in the novel, we quickly learn that she has an old soul.<br /><br />Involved  in the early part of the Democratic run for a presidential candidate, with a clever mix of real and imagined candidates, Amy's struck by the parallel between a young Hispanic man who crashes a fund-raiser, claiming the blueblooded Senator who is running for office is his father.  Amy's own life has been lived trying not to speculate on why and how her mother, Phyllis, left her in the care of crazy Grandma Lil and jailbird Chicky.  Phyllis never once looked back, and Amy has to decide - does she want to find Phyllis and find the answers to all those questions or is it just safer to leave the genie in the bottle?<br /><br />  Interspersed with the quest for her identity are the often humorous anecdotes of Amy's struggle with editorial control at the magazine, and her on and off again romance<br /><br />with John.  Warning:  there is a broken heart that really leaves you feeling bereft in this novel.<br /><br />In the concluding chapters, I will admit to tears, because Isaacs truly engaged me in her character, and never went over-the-top for her laughs.  Indeed, Isaacs practices wit more than humor, romance more than sexual heat, and contemporary writing more than groundbreaking plotting.  Reviewing the above, you may yawn and think it's just another plot that's been done before, but you haven't counted on Isaacs' style and way with a phrase or a concept. Here she has Amy assess her life:<br /><br />\\"I could fit in anywhere:  With all the kids on the bus going upstate to visit their fathers in prison.  With all the Ivey girls and the guys they hung with.  In a government seminar at Harvard.  Drinking with the Democratic powers-that-be in Chicago.  Except when you could theoretically live a thousand different lives, how do you pick the one where you belong?\\"<br /><br />Join Isaacs and Amy for a journey of discovery, and enjoy the wit, charm, warmth, and ultimately and unfortunately, the end of a smart new novel.  Isaacs only averages<br /><br />one novel every 2.5 years.  That's way too few with too much space between them, for my taste.

Although I liked \\"Blow Fly\\" more than most of Cornwell's readers did, I should have quit the series after the 12th novel.  In this, \\"Trace\\", her 13th, I'm heartened that she tries to recapture some of the original magic by moving Kay Scarpetta, the forensics expert and medical examiner that is her centerpiece, back to Richmond, Virginia, from whence she came.  But Cornwell proves again to me that her heart just isn't in it, and she's continuing to work in the series due to publishing commitments, money, or a combination of the two.<br /><br />Although not her worst work (a left-handed compliment, if I've ever heard one...that particular honor goes to \\"Isle of Dogs\\"), \\"Trace\\" leaves the reader impatient and wishing he/she had not wasted their money.<br /><br />There is nothing new here....Marino is still as ornery as ever, Lucy is in self-destruction mode with her latest relationship,  Kay somehow is managing to keep on keeping on with Benton Wesley, who disappeared and left her thinking he was dead some books back.  For whatever reason, she has not told him to take a flying leap...and he is still keeping secrets from her.<br /><br />Cornwell actually creates a character named Edgar Allen Pogue, someone Kay knew in school, and adds Joel Marcus, Kay's successor at the Richmond Medical Examiner's Office, to the mix.  Both characters are over the top in terms of their idiosyncracies, and both weigh the actual case, the murder of a 14 year old girl, down, immensely.<br /><br />There is little new here, although Cornwell does do some apt description of the actual ME procedures and returns Kay to cooking, one of her few hobbies that actually makes her seem that she is still the lifelike character that Cornwell originally created.<br /><br />This will be my last Cornwell read, and, like Blowfly, I'm planning to actually resell the hardcover, something I never do in the series I remain loyal to.  Unfortunately, that means I'll be sticking someone else with this dud, so I'd better price it cheaply.<br /><br />Kellerman and Grafton have been able to revive their series, each with mixed results, but it appears that Cornwell is no longer interested in bringing Scarpetta back to life.<br /><br />I wish her well in whatever she decides to do when these pale shadows of her former writing stop selling.'d better price it cheaply.   <br /> <br />Kellerman and Grafton have been able to revive their series, each with mixed results, but it appears that Cornwell is no longer interested in bringing Scarpetta back to life. <br />I wish her well in whatever she decides to do when these pale shadows of her former writing stop selling.   <br /> <br />	2004-09-29

Leave it to John Dunning to remind modern readers that there was more than just one Richard Burton...not just the 20th century award-winning thespian (and husband to Liz Taylor), but also a fascinating, 19th century explorer, knighted by the British for his anthropological discoveries, his books, and his work as a linguist as he traveled the globe.  Dunning weaves flashbacks of Burton's tour of the American south just before the Civil War into his modern-day tale about  a hero we've been waiting to see again, rare bookseller and ex-policeman Cliff Janeway.<br /><br />Janeway, as you may or may not recall, is the centerpiece of two of Dunning's earlier works, which established a mini-cult for readers, proving, once and for all, that there is nothing booklovers love more than reading about books.  It has been eight years since Dunning followed the success of Booked To Die, Janeway's first outing, with The Bookman's Wake.  Mystery readers around the globe waited somewhat impatiently for Dunning's alter-ego (he, too, sold rare books) to reappear.  The wait was worth it.<br /><br />In The Bookman's Promise, Janeway has purchased a first edition of Sir Richard Burton's, and the rare book leads him on a quest to find a missing collection of Burton's works, and, it's hoped for, a never-published journal about his travels in America with the relative of the woman who claims the books were stolen from her family.  Dunning weaves slices of today's quest with exerpts from the old journal, as the men, separated by time and reason, travel the same paths in the American southeast.<br /><br /> Along the way, Janeway gets involved in the struggle between powerful families, suffers the death of a friend, and begins a love affair.  With the exception of traveling companions Erin, and Koko - both of whom are somewhat mediocre characters, Dunning populates Janeway's quest not only with fascinating places and glimpses into the past, but with well-drawn supporting characters.<br /><br />The Bookman's Promise educates as well as entertains, and was well worth the wait!> <br />The Bookman's Promise educates as well as entertains, and was well worth the wait! <br />	2004-09-19

Richard Ford's hero, Frank Bascombe, accomplished the most important thing in his life when he published a book of short stories at the age of 25.  Since then, to the open wonderment of his peers, he has labored in an act of love, by writing feature stories on a variety of sports, across the country.<br /><br />And, although his stories are published in top-drawer publications, it seems as though everyone who comes in contact with Frank wonders why is the quality of his life's work so, so mediocre....is that all there is?<br /><br />Frank's been cheating on his wife for a long time, and is now divorced from her, pretty much against his will.  His love affairs post-divorce have all the character of a married man still cheating.  The death of their son has led each of them to indifference and sadness.<br /><br />In this ultimately sad portrait of the divorced, middle aged American male, Ford has crafted the ultimately flawed hero.  He brings us into Frank's search for himself.  He's a cynic who cannot accept<br /><br />what happened to his son and his marriage, but ultimately still has an underlying sense of optimism.<br /><br />The pace of the novel is somewhat slow, and initially, Frank's passing acquaintance with an even more pitiful divorced male, who ultimately commits suicide, is puzzling and out of character.<br /><br />Somehow, just somehow, through Frank's emotional awakening, Richard Ford re-introduces us to everyman, and, in doing so, presents the theory that we all grow into, and that many of us cannot acknowledge or accept ..... that sometimes our lives turn out to be less than our promise, less than they way we could have lived them.  But, despite that, there is always  a way to turn a corner, to make the future brighter than it once was.  The book is not for everyone, much as most of Ford's<br /><br />novels.  For the reader that truly enjoys a writer who is accomplished at his craft, and one who is ultimately trying to get under his readers' skins, \\"The Sportswriter\\" is an eloquent and excellent read.<br /><br />\\"Independence Day\\" - a companion novel about Bascombe, is equally as well-written.ortswriter\\" is an eloquent and excellent read. <br /> <br />\\"Independence Day\\" - a companion novel about Bascombe, is equally as well-written.	2004-09-08

What is selling this book to so many people?<br />\\"The Rule of Four\\" is proving to be incredibly popular; I have to believe that folks who don't know about Umberto Eco and really liked the mundane \\"DaVinci Code\\" are looking for some suspense  wrapped up in history.  Somehow, the literary movers and shakers in the publishing world have decided that \\"The Rule of Four\\", written by two young and inexperienced authors, is just what the doctor ordered.<br />Well, it is not.  There's a gem of a plot here, with literary research into the encryption of codes in a 500 year old novel, the \\"Hypnerotomachia Poliphili\\" (which, I'm told, really exists) taking place on the campus of Princeton University.  And while the central themes in the ancient book, and the treasure it is protecting, and the need of two young men to solve a mystery that eluded their illustrious forbears, is compelling, The Rule of Four is essentially about friendship and loyalty between the two and, in turn, their own two best friends.  Salted in the story of friendship is Tom's relationship with a young woman he meets at Princeton and his conflict at ignoring her while pursuing the mystery.  There's little character development, and overlapping writing styles between the two authors that have  a way of clashing.<br />The main plot is unraveled unsatisfactorily at the end of the book, and the campus hijinks and traditions of Princeton are woven into the story in a way that makes you wonder how these intelligent and mature young men could bear to be on a campus so steeped in silly tradition.  Caldwell and Thomasen, the authors, seem to be developing more of a movie script than a book, and their style and failure to keep the premise of the ancient mystery (dropping it in favor of long descriptions of campus events, and weaving in an unlikely villain) makes me cringe at the thought that I paid full price for the book, before it hit the top ten list and started being discounted.<br />Like \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" and \\"The Lovely Bones\\" before it, \\"The Rule of Four\\" will get a large following because of the concept, and not the execution.  A workmanlike read, it's not a book that I'll keep on my shelves or read again.  Still, worth a read, if only to get an idea of how complex the Renaissance period was, and how relics like the Hypnerotomachia reflected the passion and cruelty of those times.  A grudging recommendation to read it...perhaps you will like it more than I did.\\" and \\"The Lovely Bones\\" before it, \\"The Rule of Four\\" will get a large following because of the concept, and not the execution.

Good ingredients in this story -- a lot of Milo and Alex acting as sidekicks; a solid resolution to the &quot;Robin&quot; angle, with Robin now out of his life, and an interesting new<br />love in it.<br />The plot begins crisply, and Kellerman weaves a typical television psychologist into the mix (more of a PR specialist than a therapist).  But the mystery bogs down when an international flavor is added and the final resolution is way, way out there...beyond what the reader needed or wanted.  I don't know if Kellerman doesn't outline his plots and resolutions in his drabber books beforehand, and just continues to build castles in the air when trying to finish, or if he just gets bored.<br />Anyway, a disappointment after his resurrection of Alex Delaware mysteries over the course of the last three books in series.  Trite, and not worth your time.	2004-06-22

However, it was for the work of director Neil Labute that I went to see the movie, &quot;Possession&quot;, and only then did I realize it was based on what is purported to be Byatt's most important work.  I wondered what could make LaBute leave his sardonic field of original screenwriting and adapt this book to a screenplay...and I must say, with some sadness, that his film was only adequate.  However, as he must have, I found the plot was truly unique and the concept of possession so interwoven in each character, amazing.  And then, the relationship between the two 19th century poets was so moving, I decided to tackle the novel.<br />It is exquisite.<br />First, Byatt, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, discards the concept of a &quot;novel&quot; and subtitles it, &quot;A Romance&quot;.  Whether she realized it or not, this would result in many &quot;romance novel&quot; readers trying to tackle her 1990 masterpiece, only to discard it as &quot;too long and boring&quot;.  But Byatt persisted in the classification of a &quot;romance&quot;  after taking the meaning of the prose of Nathaniel Hawthorne, who wrote:<br />&quot;When a writer calls his work a Romance....while as a work of art, it must rigidly subject itself to laws, and while it sins unpardonably so far as it may swerve aside from the truth of the human heart -- has fairly a right to present that under circumstances, to a great extent, of the writer's own choosing.&quot;<br />Here, Byatt boldly invents two 19th century writers. Stunningly, she juxtaposes their existence with real writers of the period...Lord Tennyson, Goethe, Wordsworth, Christina Rossetti, Crabb Robinson, etc.  She creates long passages of their work, both prose and poetry (some of it epic) and their letters to each other.  It is if she gets inside of their heads and has written, disembodied, as each in the language and the culture of the times.  Moreover, she instills their work with passages that clarify what was the mystery of their romance.  Passages that only become clear when modern day scholars discover the romance, and can attribute the commonality and beauty in each of their works to their love for one another.  Most readers will assume that Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte, really existed, and will only realize they are fictional after checking search engines carefully!<br />Many others have outlined the plotting here - the parallel story of two modern-day scholars following an inexact trail of evidence they unearth, to document a love story that takes the literary world by storm.  Both the modern day and the Victorian romance are between participants (Maud and Roland in this century, Ash and Christabel in the 19th) who are somewhat aloof from the world, imbued by their studies and crafts, and content with solitary existences...almost afraid to give themselves to another in a relationship.  Byatt skillfully uses dialogue, the content of letters and poems, and symbolism...the dissection of sea creatures by Ash on his journeys, the stark yearning for the &quot;solitary, empty white bed&quot; that Maud and Roland both desire.<br />The very creation of this work, which won the UK's Booker prize in 1990, and the lasting regard with which it is held, will make it a classic.  So, too, will the richness of Byatt's writing and research, and the thrill of the mystery that surrounds Ash and Christabel...and how it is finally solved by the modern day seekers.  It is compelling in its second half, beautiful, though somewhat difficult to read in its first.  If you must skim the letters and poems in your first read, be sure to read them carefully when you finally pick up the book again (and you will!) because elements of mystery, relationship, manners and morals will all reveal themselves to you, enhancing the story.  Think, too, on the layers and layers of &quot;possession&quot; or obsessiveness that are shown by both major and well-sketched minor characters in both time periods of the book.<br />A timeless book, with some sardonic wit that pokes fun at academic society, the somewhat boorish mannerisms of Americans abroad,  and the clash between the world and the feminist movement...this is a gem, to be treasured and kept on bookshelves forever.<br />Highly recommended for serious readers.nd well-sketched minor characters in both time periods of the book.  <br />A timeless book, with some sardonic wit that pokes fun at academic society, the somewhat boorish mannerisms of Americans abroad,  and the clash between the world and the feminist movement...this is a gem, to be treasured and kept on bookshelves forever.<br />Highly recommended for serious readers.	2004-06-13

His style is compelling and his heroine, in this story, could be you, watching and wondering as the comfortable life you inow and love disappears in an instant.<br />The tangle of characters in &quot;Just One Look&quot; starts with husband and wife, Jack and Grace Lawson.  Grace is semi-famous as the survivor of a tragic stampede at a rock concert, where 18 people were killed when an out of control crowd tried to escape gunshots.  The tragedy is known as &quot;The Boston Massacre&quot; and Grace still limps due to her injuries in the melee.<br />The Massacre haunts the parents and loved ones of those who died and Grace knows that the disappearance of her husband one night is somehow connected with her past.  She can't help but feel responsible for Jack being missing, since she showed him an old photograph of 5 people; the picture mysteriously appeared in the most recent package of photos she had processed at the local Photomat.<br />Jack's in the photo, but Grace doesn't know the identity of the others...Coben follows her efforts to find the truth about the picture, and to find Jack.  Over time, she learns that the others have been tainted by tragedy, have disappeared, or have lost their own lives.  In trying to solve the mystery, Grace enlists a mob connection, Carl Vespa, whose son died in the Massacre, local police and attorneys who are all somehow connected to the photograph.  Serial-killer-for-hire Eric Wu (who appeared in Coben's &quot;Tell No One&quot;) is the key to deaths and disappearances.  Grace is able to follow the thread, while trying to keep her small children safe.<br />Although I was taken with the tension and the mystery of the plot, I was sorely disappointed at the overall quality of the book.  Coben seems caught, in his last four works, with a tangle of spouses with mysterious pasts and present disappearances.  Although I could not guess the outcomes of this particular thriller, (they remain vague and unsettling, then tumble out of the final chapter) neither was I very interested in the motivations of the characters or the secrets from the past.<br />Coben needs to incorporate his tension-filled style with a new and more unique plotline in order to keep the audience he's built since he stopped writing his &quot;humor-thriller&quot; series about sports agent Myron Bolitar.  In &quot;Just One Look&quot; he gives us great pacing, but then dumps the outcomes one after another in the final chapter.  There's not enough new here to be wildly enthusiastic, but I'm not ready to give up on Coben just yet.

That comment alone causes readers who appreciate fiction writing for the writing caliber, as opposed to the plot, to groan aloud. &quot;The Eight&quot; is an oversized (500+ pages) novel, a first time effort for author Katherine Neville, whose later works are far less popular. &quot;The Eight&quot; on the other hand, is much beloved and widely read.<br />Neville's prose is typical of first time authors. Characterization can be thin, dialogue can be unrealistic, the romance altogether too passionate to be believable. What distinguishes this work, and what has given the book its cult following is the plot, the plot, the plot, the PLOT!<br />The premise takes two parallel events, in two different timeframes (the '70's and the late 18th century) and weaves the stories together. Both are quests for the mystical Montglane chess set, an Indian relic, once a gift to Charlemagne. Neville's got an imagination that knows no bounds, and she draws dozens of historical figures into the plot mix, both in this century and that. Catherine the Great plays a role, as does modern-day despot Muhammar Khaddafi. The Montglane chess set, like Tolkien's &quot;The One Ring&quot;, has mystical powers, and must be prevented, by an innocent, from falling into the hands of those who represent evil and anarchy.<br />Part fairy tale, part romance, part historical fiction, part suspense novel, &quot;The Eight&quot; is unforgettable for its complexity and the peek into the mind of a great storyteller.

Cray's black topics and sense of humor are impressive, and I've read each of his three prior outings ( &quot;Bad Lawyer&quot;, &quot;Little Girl Blue&quot; and &quot;What You Wish For&quot;) with enthusiasm, but, in \\"Partners\\", he takes it to a new level. A compelling, interesting read by an author who is keeping his real identity a secret.<br /> In this tense story of serial murder, Cray tells his story from two points of view: that of an NYPD twosome, detectives Belinda Moore and Pudge Pedersson and that of the killer himself, Jorge \\"Finito\\" Rakowski.<br />In Moore and Pedersson, Cray gives us a contrast of two partners who read each other's signals well, and who both struggle to put in perspective the balance between a job that can sometimes be all-consuming, and a personal life. Cray does a masterful job of giving us a friendship and a contrast in styles that succeed in getting the twosome what they want, (namely, the recognition of the powers that be that their early and insightful hunch that a serial killer is loose in Manhattan) and help them create the task force that will hunt Finito down.<br />As good a write as Cray gives us about the police duo, the real draw of \\"Partners\\" is the character of Finito, himself. Finito roams Manhattan as a small-time grifter, a handsome con man who has spent his younger days with petty crime, and who's recently finished a stint in prison. Finito's anger at the world and at his lot in life, and his latent sociopathic tendencies, Finito is surprised and gratified by the thrill he gets from killing a hooker he is trying to rob.<br />From that point, Finito makes a conscious decision to make his mark on the world with an escalating pattern of attack, torture, and death for a variety of women. With no \\"signature\\" initially, it is difficult to piece together Finito's early crimes as the pattern of a serial, but his \\"progress\\" is tracked by Moore-Pedersson until he eventually paints himself into a corner.<br />In looking at the world through Finito's eyes, Cray gives the reader a real sense of soulessness and depravity, of one man's revenge and intent to discard his own life in return for grisly fame. Finito is the serial killer that many of us do not expect, the one whose latent tendencies and good looks hide his need to inflict pain. He's not the young kid who started out by killing animals, not the social outcast, not the type of man who makes women nervous in his company. In short, Finito is the most dangerous of all types - the killer that walks among us, disguised by his normalcy.<br />This book may be too violent for some, but if you like the genre, don't miss &quot;Partners&quot;.he world through Finito's eyes, Cray gives the reader a real sense of soulessness and depravity, of one man's revenge and intent to discard his own life in return for grisly fame.

Conceptually, Haigh has plotted a compelling tale of the three women who marry Ken Kimble. We see the story through the passage of time. First we meet Birdie Kimble, abandoned with two small children by Ken the minister. Ken married Birdie when he taught at a Christian college. 13 years her senior, he was fired after her pregnancy and their hurried marriage became public. Things get truly horrific for Charlie and Jody, Birdie's children, when the reality of how poor they are, how little there is to eat, and how much wine Birdie drinks hit home. The only thing that saves the children is the need for Birdie to return home for a family funeral, where the kindness of relatives helps keep the small trio afloat.<br />Ken moves on with another student, young Moira Snell. Through her parents in Florida, he meets a rich woman, Joan, who is older than he is, and who finally provides him with the kind of money and setting he needs to strike it rich in real estate. In order to fit in, Ken, the product of a conservative Christian background, pretends to be Jewish. Joan is a survivor of breast cancer - and when she can't conceive, Ken briefly absconds with his and Birdie's children to try to fill up the house and pacify her. Charlie takes matters in his own hands and manages to run away with Jody on a bus back home. Joan is subsequently overtaken by another bout with cancer, leaving Ken a relatively young, rich widower.<br />Ken's final marriage is to Dinah - a young woman who used to babysit for his kids, whom he meets again quite by accident in Washington DC. Dinah's independent and smart, but she, too, is taken in by Ken. She becomes his wife and bears him a son, but soon learns that Ken in marriage is not the same as Ken in courtship. Dinah is his trophy -- he encourages her to have treatment for a large facial birthmark, and utilize makeup and a style of dress that make him the envy of his peers for his \\"trophy wife\\". He cares little for Brendan, his son with Dinah, and is openly critical of the boy.<br />Kimble is one of those charismatic rolling-stones who invariably attract women that he wants and wants to use for his own purposes. It is not until after months and years of marriage that the women he chooses realize how shallow and self-serving he is. Marrying for youth, beauty or wealth and success, Kimble quickly loses interest in each wife and treats them like the possessions he feels they are. Willing to desert and then to kidnap his own children, lie about his heritage, carry on extramarital affairs and cheat in business, Ken Kimble, as portrayed by Haigh, is a chilling anti-hero. His legacy is the unhappy solitude he brings to his own children, each of whom distrust marriage and commitment.<br />Only four stars for a book rich in imagination, description, dialogue and character? Why? Haigh moves and affects the reader with her portrayal of only two of the three wives. In Birdie and Joan, complete opposites come alive on the pages. Their vulnerabilities are exposed and exploited by Ken, and we can only watch in shock. The third wife, Dinah, perhaps the most admirable of the three, is perplexing in her motivation and her actions. Haigh may have relaxed her standards in writing the final chapters of the story, and Dinah remains a kind of mystery to the reader. Still, the book is definitely a cut above most \\"women's\\" fiction, and you can't stop turning the pages.openly critical of the boy. <br />Kimble is one of those charismatic rolling-stones who invariably attract women that he wants and wants to use for his own purposes.

I really like Sara Lewis and think that many women of all ages can relate to her books.  In &quot;Second Draft of My Life&quot;, her heroine is a forty two year old writer named Charlotte, who is determined to leave her life as a writer to become an elementary school teacher.<br />Would-be novelists can learn a lot from the fictional Charlotte.  So many writers believe that getting their first book published is the end of the rainbow.  Charlotte's had five published, and the book realistically shows the fight to get distribution, publicity, sales and a movie tie-in.  Perhaps Lewis speaks autobiographically, since she's been successful in getting published, but less so in terms of sales and notoriety.<br />While Charlotte is changing professions, and coping with the real world of teaching young children, a challenge for the not-so-faint of heart, she's also given up a romance that was going nowhere and attempting to find a meaningful relationship.<br />Although Lewis has the ability to see inside many angles of a woman's thought process and struggle through the everyday ups and downs of life, and although her gentle humor is heartwarming and charming, overall, this particular novel didn't succeed with me.<br />Throughout the first 225 pages, Lewis successfully gives us the ups and downs of Charlotte's attempt to start over.  You become invested in what she is doing, and what decisions she will make to tinker with the path she's put herself on.  And though you know there will be a happy ending, you're not prepared for the speed at which a simplistic idea that Charlotte sort of falls into, turns it all around for her, buttoning up all her loose ends, and doing a 180 degree turn....all in the last 75 pages of the book.  Too many answers in too little time...Lewis seems to tire of the story and want to wrap it up fast.<br />Try other books by Lewis before you read this one, and you will see her skill in the art of writing for and about women.	2004-03-19

Daniel Silva is the author of six prior espionage thrillers; his newest is the third in a trilogy that explorse various phases of the aftermath of the Holocaust.  His centerpiece, art restorer Mario Delvecchio, is, in reality, an agent of the Israeli government named Gabriel Allon.  In the prior two novels, \\"The English Assassin\\" and \\"The Confessor\\", the collaboration of the Swiss bankers and the Vatican, in the aftermath of the world's worst act of genocide, are explored in modern-day settings.<br />Allon is the instrument of atonement that brings the past to light in each of the first two books, and his role is similar in \\"A Death in Vienna\\".  A fierce and violent act, the bombing of The Wartime Claims and Inquiries office in Vienna, opens the novel.  With two young girls dead and the head of the Claims office, Eli Levon, in a coma, Allon has no choice but to travel back to a city he would prefer to forget -- the city where his own wife and child were victims of a bomb some years before.<br />Allon's meeting with a Holocaust survivor, Max Klein, leads him to suspect an Austrian business mogul, Erich Radek.  Lavon has been investigating Radek's ties to the Nazis based on Klein's account of a cold-blooded killing he witnessed.  Radek has a new name, and his credentials have been washed through the CIA, and a red herring escape to Argentina.<br />The depth of this novel, compared to its predecessors, is in the personal tie in that Allon finds of Radek to his own mother, who barely survived two years in Auschwitz-Birkenau.  Through her artwork, and the record of her testimony kept at Yad Vishem, the Israeli memorial center for Holocaust research, Allon learns the startling truth, that Radek, acting as the director of Aktion 1005, had an altercation with his mother on what has come to be known as the Death March from Birkenau.<br />In his mother's testimony:<br />\\"It has been twelve years.  Not a day passes that I don't see the faces of Rachel and Sarah -- and the face of the man who murdered them.  Their death's weigh heavily on me....on the anniversary of their murders, I say mourner's kaddish for them.  I do this out of habit but not faith.  I lost my faith in God in Birkenau.\\"<br />The difficulty, and the importance, of Radek to modern-day Austria is in his blood ties to the strongest candidate for the chancellorship of the Austrian nation.  Given his position, and the anti-Semitism that still flares in modern-day Austria, it is tempting for Allon's handlers to simply expose Radek; but in the end, Allon's plan to kidnap him and return him to Israel is the path that is chosen.<br />Daniel Silva has exactly the right spirit for his material.  A consummate journalist, he ties his fictional account into true events - his research is impeccable.  In spare and tense prose, he moves a large group of characters around an obstacle, developing subplots that are as complex as Allon's travel schedule.  He is unafraid to tie in the Swiss banking complex, the Vatican and the CIA into the intended/unintended passage of Nazi war criminals into modern society, without the punishment they deserved, and without making reparations to the families of those they slaughtered.<br />The Aktion 1005 effort, under which the Nazis unearthed poorly disguised graves of Holocaust victims and destroyed the evidence in a systematic effort, was tied to famous Austrian criminal Paul Blobel, who was convicted and hanged at Nuremburg.  Blobel went to his grave without ever revealing the details of Aktion 1005.  It is not a stretch for Silva to set his stage with a fictional character who played a pivotal role in the coverup, much of which remains a mystery today.<br />Silva deserves his following; his plotting resonates with the readers, his action scenes and dialogue are compelling.  He exposes the hidden Vienna and the haven that war criminals found in Argentina in the same way he has pointed it out in Munich, and in the Vatican.  He accomplishes his goal of awell-paced and intricate thriller, interspersed with just enough history to make sure that we never forget.<br />Superb.goal of a well-paced and intricate thriller, interspersed with just enough history to make sure that we never forget.  <br />Superb.	2004-03-12

The imprisonment of American citizens of Japanese descent, post Pearl Harbor, remains one of those open, gaping wounds of despicable behavior in our country's history.  Most of the historical tomes and novels of WWII fail to address the country's overreaction to the Japanese Empire's aggression and terrorism.  And, indeed, our government's \\"protection\\" of these citizens may have saved some of the Japanese populace from civilian attacks.  Still, the actions of the government, and the silent response of the American people closely parallel the rise of McCarthyism in the next decade, and also harken some of the less-publicized aspects of today's Patriot Act.<br />Otsuka has chosen a more delicate approach to her tale than that of nonfiction writiers.  \\"When the Emperor Was Divine\\" tells its story from the viewpoints of a family of four, torn apart by Evacuation Order #19.  A young Japanes mother in Berkeley, left alone with an 11 year-old girl and an 8 year-old son begins to pack and to close her house as soon as she sees the order posted.  Saddest of her tasks is how she must deal with the family's pets, all the while maintaining an air of normalcy for her children that masks her fear.<br />The children's father has been spirited away by the FBI in his bathrobe and slippers in the middle of the night, questioned endlessly, and imprisoned in Texas.<br />Otsuka's tale focuses on the journey of the mother and the children; an intermediate holding facility at the Tanforan race track in California is couched in memory as the family is transported by train to the deserts of Utah.<br />In stark passages - poetry in the form of prose, Otsuka conveys the pain and hopelessness of the three and a half years the family spends imprisoned.  From the third person she writes primarily from the viewpoint of each child as the mother retreats into herself.  Long days without hope mingle with cruel weather conditions in the desert...<br />\\" Summer was a long hot dream.  Every morning, as soon as the sun rose, the temperature began to soar.  By noon the floors were sagging.  The sky was bleached white from the heat and the wind was hot and dry.  Yellow dust devils whirled across the sand.  The black roofs baked in the sun.

Mary Beth, a waitress raising her younger sister and a small adopted son, is a caretaker by nature.  She discovers a unique talent, &quot;reading people's lives&quot;.  Unlike a fortune teller, MaryBeth talks to others about the songs that are important to them, and have been important to them throughout their lives.  Mary Beth does &quot;readings&quot; and keeps charts on everyone who comes to her for help, and her advice, gained through an analysis of the lyrics that keep popping up in a client's head at odd moments.  To Mary Beth ...&quot;I have a calling in life&quot; .. and her help is usually so on track that a large following in their little town relies on the premise that their own songs are not random, but rather that they have meaning just waiting to be uncovered; something that, it seems, only Mary Beth can do.<br />It's an interesting premise, and it is background music to the story told by LeeAnn, Mary's Beth's adolescent sister.  To LeeAnn, the gift inspires others and puts their little family in the heart of the town....<br />&quot;... wishing I could go back to when the music was like a spirit moving through our town, giving words to what we felt, connecting us all.&quot;<br />As the tale unfolds, parallel secrets about a prominent town citizen are uncovered through song reading, leading Mary Beth's reputation to tarnish, and her spirits to unravel.  At the same time, secrets of their own family -- why their father disappeared, and what role their deceased mother played, are covered up by Mary Beth, who thinks that she is sheltering LeeAnn from knowledge that will hurt her.<br />Eventually, unhinged by the responsibility for both the family and the town's opinion, Mary Beth begins to fade, and it is then that LeeAnn takes over the indomitable spirit that has kept them going for years.<br />Although based on a unique and whimsical premise, Tucker's book is really about relationships, the bond between sisters, and about never giving up, no matter how difficult the terrain of your life.  Tucker writes lyrically and well, bringing each and every character to life, including the mystical father figure, who finally comes to be a part of their lives again.  Both sisters in the tale finally find the one thing, the love between the two of them,  that will give them &quot;the strength to handle all the rest&quot;.<br />I so look forward to more from this author, and highly recommend this lovely debut.>Although based on a unique and whimsical premise, Tucker's book is really about relationships, the bond between sisters, and about never giving up, no matter how difficult the terrain of your life.

Cruisie's wit shines through in her characterization, her dialogue, and her ability to laugh at situations she's doubtless been in, through her characters' eyes.<br />All of that seems missing from \\"Bet Me\\", her latest.  I'm told it's an older manuscript that got polished for publication -- but much of what I enjoy about Cruisie's work is missing.  There are no really likeable characters here, especially in the parents of lead characters Min and Calvin.  In terms of romance and sexual situations, which Crusie excels at - you can get warm reading what Calvin thinks about Min, but you really can't see much real passion from any of the other characters for their various partners.  The characters I hated included Cynthie, David...and I was pretty impatient with Bonnie and her outlook on fairy tale lives (although her proposal to Calvin's friend was witty)...and Crusie went on and on about Min's weight, her self-consciousness, and her carb count.  Truly, this book was an advertisement for Krispy Kreme donuts and chicken Marsala.<br />Crusie can do much, much better, and I'm looking forward to her next work of original, and not reworked material.<br />2 stars - I really wouldn't bother, if I were you.	2004-02-20
US	45979403	R2NEYX54CZVROA	087113795X	996091853	Peace Like a River	Books	5	14	15	N	Y	The Minnesota &quot;tall tale&quot; gets a modern twist....	Leif Enger becomes a lightning rod for praise and blame in \\"Peace Like A River\\".  Judging just from the reviews on this site, you can either wax rhapsodic about his tale, or just view it as contemporary claptrap.<br />Leif Enger, in his first novel,  couldn't be more Minnesotan.  Raised on Minnesota farm, he lives as an adult on a farm in a quintessential small town of the hinterland, with his wife and children.  For most of his adult career, prior to the release of \\"Peace Like a River\\" he worked for Minnesota Public Radio (which also begat Garrison Keillor).  Like Keillor, Enger looks for beauty in the simple way of life around him, and roots it in the family.  But other comparisons do no justice to either man.  So, too, has Enger's novel been compared to \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", mostly because the narration is through the eyes of a child, who is telling the story as an adult.  Symbolism and the discovery of one's parents' true nature are themes for Enger, as much as they were for Lee.<br />But Enger does strike out into new territory with \\"Peace Like a River\\" -- he captures the charm and folk wisdom of the Minnesota \\"tall tale\\", and sets it in a relatively contemporary setting - 1962 in the heartland.  More successful at weaving Christian mysticism and the appearance of miracles into his narrative than say, contemporary writers such as Dean Koontz, Leif Enger brings a true talent for rich prose and unsettling questions to his tale.<br />Synopsis of the plot:<br />Born an asthmatic, Reuben Land's first miraculous event was finally beginning to breathe after several minutes of stillness, when his father, Jeremiah, orders him to breathe in the name of the living God.  Reuben is raised by his father, with older brother Davy and younger sister Swede.  Abandoned at a young age by their mother, Reuben and his siblings grow up in a way that many children who feel abandoned do - they develop skills and thoughts far more mature than is normal for their age.  In this family, most of the precociousness is drawn in 9-year old Swede, who commands language and vocabulary far above that of most adults.  Swede's interest in all things western form the story's backdrop, as she writes lyric poetry with a larger than life character, Sunny Sundown.<br />From Reuben's point of view, his early life, is as a spectator, watching his dad perform miracles and overturn the laws of nature.  It is left to the reader to divine whether the miracles do occur, or are just what they are in the viewpoint of a small boy who witnesses over and over how Jeremiah pulls his family together with faith and love.<br />In a search for Reuben's older brother, Jeremiah confronts obstacles and seemingly performs feats which make the obstacles disappear.  Are they really miracles, or do they feel as such to a scared, eleven year-old boy?  It is evident that Jeremiah's strong belief in God and his ability to connect to God to protect and provide for his family are the driving force behind the Land family's ability to find Davy, and to find comfort in the circle of a woman named Roxanna.  In the tale, Enger also draws a villain named `Jape', like Koontz's villains, almost a caricature of Satan.  What comes to prevent the most tragic of fates, and lends a remarkable conclusion to the tale, is best left to the reader to pursue.<br />Enger adds rich texture to the tale by the quality of his prose.  He can invoke memories from me of the land and the beauty and fear of a child when coming of age.  His faith is simple and strong, and from it he envisions the miracles that Jeremiah performs to keep his family together.  Forces of nature (blizzards, fires) conspire to give you the feeling that you are truly being transported to the wild west, a land where people need to come to terms with how to live around what nature puts in their path.<br /> And, like Harper Lee, Enger is able to get inside the mind of a child, and put forth a child's vision and wishes into contemporary terms asthey focus their desires through toys and activities.  Less of an adventure story than a tale to reinforce the value of a strong family, I think Enger's novel is somewhat miraculous in and of itself, a surprising journey into emotions you felt as a child, and have since forgotten.<br />It feels as though there is at least some of the autobiographical in Enger's novel.  Read it, delight in it!s they focus their desires through toys and activities.

US	45979403	R2FPMO66RQARMT	0385336209	102028540	Blinded (Dr. Alan Gregory Novels)	Books	4	21	23	N	Y	Somewhat of a disappointment	Four stars for author Stephen White's 12th book in the Alan Gregory series -- specifically for the way in which Gregory emphasizes interesting and perennial character Sam Purdy's involvement in solving a series of murders, tied to the disappearance of a former patient of Alan's.  Purdy is colorful, as a Boulder detective, and despite both his health and marital troubles in &quot;Blinded&quot; - he is off on a cross-country search, paired on and off with an interesting female detective, and the narrarator of much of the story.<br />White has used the device of telling a story from two perspectives before, notably in his last novel, &quot;The Best Revenge&quot;, and he's particularly successful with this tool.<br />Although the chase starts with Alan, who learns from a former patient, Gibbs Storey, that her charismatic and troubled husband may be a serial killer, he is more of a sideline participant in terms of the action.  In this installment, Alan's wife, Lauren, is disturbed by a particularly chilling episode in her battle with MS.  Raw emotion and fear about the situation is felt from Alan's point of view -- White doesn't get inside Lauren's head in this novel.  Having some experience with friends stricken by the disease, I've always been compelled by the educational and awareness aspects of White's<br />tales, helping his readers understand the MS complex.<br />What brings this tale down is a repetitive theme of White's -- the therapist's dilemma in not knowing how much confidential information given by patients can be disclosed to the outside world.  White's Gregory seems to chafe under the yoke of having to keep disturbing information confidential, and in this novel, a secondary plot involving disclosures by his other patients emphasizes this theme.  White last explored this theme in his 10th book, &quot;Warning Signs&quot;, and it wore on the reader then.  I'm not sure why he chose to emphasize it again, but it was taxing.<br />Also missing from the book is White's signature twist of plot in the climax.  Although he attempts to surprise the reader, the telltale signs of who murdered the young women in question are all laid out, and come as no surprise, based on the way the action unfolds.<br />These disappointing features are offset by the voice of Sam Purdy (and his strange fascination with a turducken!)and a somewhat shocking disclosure by Sam near the end of the book.  Purdy's always been a favorite of mine; his north-country sardonic humor is offset by his keen read of situations and his odd friendship with Alan.<br />I expect a little more from White, but I did read the book at record speed, a sure sign that he drew me into his tale, despite<br />the contrivances that ended up annoying me before I finished.<br />Still a great series -- this book may not be enjoyable to those who aren't familiar with White's earlier work.hite's signature twist of plot in the climax.

US	45979403	R29M4R8ENRFOBU	0375826688	342317933	Eragon (Inheritance)	Books	5	5	7	N	Y	I don't usually read fantasy/science fiction -- but,	I made an exception for this book.<br />I can't remember how I stumbled across \\"Eragon\\", but I was at loose ends after the third film of the Lord of the Rings series (and I've read the Tolkien books too many times to count) and I found myself craving more flights of fancy and fantasy. I was taken by the fact that a 15 year old prodigy had begun such an ambitious endeavor, for author Christopher Paolini is planning to write a trilogy about his young hero, Eragon, who goes from poor farm boy to a young master, growing in power, of magic. This first book is subtitled: \\"The Inheritance\\".<br />Paolini's family first self-published 10,000 copies, and Floridian Carl Hiassen helped to sell the fantasy to Knopf, which later released a first national printing of over 100,000 copies.<br />Paolini embraces the standard fantasy world of humans, dwarves and elves (no hobbits, here!), and adds the existence of dragons, nearly extinct, as creatures of power. Elves, and sometimes humans, are selected by hatchling dragons to become Dragon Riders, companions of dragons who can communicate with them and others by telepathy. Riders have magical powers, but the use of magic drains them of much energy.<br />The evil forces of the land are somewhat more creative. Sluggish, warring monsters (Tolkiens' Orcs?), the Urgals, abound, but are no threat until they are organized for the king by the evil Ra'Zac (creatures of the King that are not human, covered in cloaks, and strongest at night) and the terrifying<br />Durka, who is a Shade (a spirit in human form, with crimson hair and maroon eyes) all of whom are working for the king, and trying to locate Eragon and his dragon.<br />Set in the fantasy world of Alagaesia, Eragon's land is ruled by Galbatorix, who once was a Rider himself. The adult dragons have all perished, and Galbatorix has been dispossessed of one of three dragon eggs by a group dedicated to ending his cruel rule, the Varden. This egg is conveyed to Eragon, and the dragon hatches in his care. Much of the facts of the land are uncovered as the book moves along, and Eragon is slowly filled in on the history of how he got to be who he is. His mother, Selena, has been missing from his life since he was a child, and the book ends without disclosing the mystery of what happened to her and just who his father was.<br />Alagaesia is bordered by Du Weldenvarden, a deep forest, home to the Elves. It appears that this will be the setting for much of book 2. The country south of the forest is a vast desert that Eragon and his traveling companions must cross to reach safety (the Hadarac). Paolini is particularly clever in devising how the small band of travelers with Eragon gets water while crossing. He's also created rich city and village profiles in the kingdom, as Eragon tries to locate the Ra'Zac, to revenge killings in Eragon's home. South of the desert are the Boer mountains, home to the dwarves, who are assisting the Varden; the climax of the novel takes place in these mountains.<br />Paolini has peppered his cast with strong characters who will assist Eragon in fulfilling his role. Brom, a wise soothsayer, with mysterious origins, becomes Eragon's mentor. Murtagh, a fearless fighter, accompanies Eragon across the desert to the Boer mountains; his history, when uncovered, is somewhat shocking. Arya is the elven woman that fills Eragon's nightmares, and must be rescued by the travelers from a prison, where she has been cruelly tortured at the hands of Durka. Ajihad is the strong leader of the Varden and Hrothgar the King of the dwarves, both of whom risk their followers to assist the young Rider. Two of the most interesting characters are Angela, an herbalist and her werecat, Solembum, both of whom are much more than they seem. Eragon encounters them more than once in this novel.<br />Above all, Saphira, the dragon that Eragon hatches and accepts for his own, weaves a magical air into the story, and her relationship to the homeless boy, and their telepathic communion and communication, form the strong story background that sets \\"Eragon\\" apart from much of what has been written in the genre in the past.<br />Paolini's a rich storyteller, with short chapters, and action-packed scenes. He doesn't forget to give his hero a conscience, nor does he fail to set the tone for the second book in the series, \\"The Eldest\\". I very much enjoyed the read, and hope he's close to finishing the second in the trilogy.and their telepathic communion and communication, form the strong story background that sets \\"Eragon\\" apart from much of what has been written in the genre in the past. <br />Paolini's a rich storyteller, with short chapters, and action-packed scenes.

Author Judith Van Gieson took time out from her mystery series starring Neil Hamel, to create a second series.  This is the first book in what I believe is a superior series to Hamel.<br />The book's a gift to booklovers (much like John Dunning's work), in that, as a rare-books librarian at a University campus, heroine Claire takes us into the world of collectors, readers, what makes value, and just the love of all things &quot;bookish&quot;.  She's an interesting heroine, with grown children, newly divorced from a marriage that makes you wonder (why did she stay?)and a new job in the often cutthroat world of academia.<br />A wealthy mentor has died, leaving his books collection to the University where Claire is employed.  It's a feather in her cap, but she also finds herself needing to agree to be the executor of his estate. His odd family and his ranch, in a rancher vs. naturalist part of New Mexico have you saying silently to her...&quot;What, are you nuts?&quot;<br />From both the donation and the need to be the executor come the mysteries.  I must say, I thought the culprit in each would be different, but I was proven wrong.  The mystery line is gentle, probably a good way to introduce a librarian into the world of crime solving.<br />The real star in this book, however, is Gieson's imagery and depth of feeling for the New Mexico landscape.  Both the raw power and beauty of the area are on display for all to see and enjoy.  She's really given the reader something solid here, as I found myself homesick, and wishing I had a Southwestern desert vacation planned.  I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.	2004-02-02

I've read so much that's good about the work of author Andrea Camilleri (a citizen of Rome, now age \\"70 \\", author of screenplays for Italian television, producer and director for TV and the theater, and award-winning novelist and short story writer) that it was inevitable that I would find the time to start his \\"Inspector Montalbano\\" series with \\"A Shape of Water\\". <br />I must admit I'm puzzled as to how the title ties into the story, but know this -- I probably won't stop until I've read them all. At this point, 4 of the 7 novels have been translated into English. First published in 1994, this novel has been translated into 8 languages, and began to circulate in English in 2002. The translator, American Stephen Sartarelli, does a fine job, and, although there is a breakdown from time to time in sentence structure, Sartarelli provides three dozen notes in the back of the book, to help Americans understand Sicilian customs and culture. This goes a long way to breaking down the barriers to the book. <br />Synopsis of the plot: <br />In a grotesque death, Sicilian politician and wealthy engineer Silvio Luparello, is found in a remote \\"pasture\\", or the equivalent of a lonely stretch of land where prostitutes ply their trade in their clients' cars. Garbagemen find the car, and the body, with its pants around its knees, and we are immediately struck by how much effort is expended to downplay the incident and cover up the cause of death. Into this mess comes well-respected middle-aged Inspector Salvo Montalbano, a life-long resident of the fictional Sicilian coastal town of Vigata. <br />The novel follows Montalbano's clever and well-manuevered search for the truth; letting the reader meet local politicians, Montalbano's friends and colleagues, the family of the dead man, and a mysterious and roundheeled woman who races cars for a living, and is somehow entangled in Luparello's death. In a sidebar, Montalbano also makes the acquaintance of the garbagemen, and learns of aserious healthcare crisis with the child of one of them. <br />As he researches the case, Montalbano breaks a lot of rules, but delicately, becomes chagrined over the affections of a young police officer (the daughter of his old friend), makes time to woo his own love, Livia, in Genoa, and flies under the radar of town leaders, religious leaders and his superior officers, all of whom want him to close the case quickly, and admit that Luparello dies of natural causes. <br />The reader develops an appreciation for Montalbano's subtlety, and his art in acquiring delicious food from friends, restaurants, and his own kitchen...Montalbano loves a good meal. The cynicism and humor are subtle here, poking gentle fun at Sicilian political customs, such as a killing where everyone hopes the death was a Mafia hit, so that they don't have to search for the real cause. <br />Having not yet read the remaining books, I believe that they probably succeed in developing tighter story lines, and allowing us to build on Montalbano's quaint idiosyncracies. Hopefully, they'll include more of his childhood friend, Gege, who is now Vigata's leading pimp... <br />\\"Salvo and Gege were listless schoolboys, learning their lessons like parrots\\".....(now as adults)..Gege: \\"And I tell you in my own interest. Because for a big cheese like Luparello to come and croak at the Pasture, isn't good for business....Can I go now? These are peak hours at the Pasture.\\" <br />Camilleri succeeds in zigzagging around in a satisfactory way, opening our eyes to the culture and humor of the Sicilians. One word of note, this work, and probably that of the following novels, is graphic in the use of foul language and sexual situations. If this bothers you, you're not going to want to read on. <br />I'm definitely impressed and am going on to read the next books in series, with the hope that the international audience is right...Camilleri just keeps getting better and better.	2004-01-29

Her 5th novel in the Kali O'Brien series, &quot;Cold Justice&quot;, was such a winner, I went back in time and read the first four.  In this 6th outing, Kali's still running her own small legal firm in San Francisco, but much of the action takes place around Lake Tahoe, where Kali has a mysterious new client, and in Las Vegas.  (Some minor plot details, below, no big spoilers!)<br />The plot opens with a bang as Kali never gets to find out what her new client, Betty Arnold, needed her to do, and why she was maintaining such secrecy.  Kali and Betty become targets at their meeting place, and Betty is killed. Over time, Kali's vague memories of the shooting and Betty's words lead her to continue to probe what her client was hiding, and why she was a target.  O'Brien shows the mettle and instincts we've seen her develop over the series to chase down people from Betty's past, and to follow it home, despite the danger that might await her.<br />An active second subplot that seems well-written and true to life involves sheriff's deputy Kim Wong, who is assigned to the case, helps to wrap up a plausible suspect, and then follows her own instincts (with help from Kali), to undermine the &quot;false case&quot; and focus on the real killer.  Jacobs goes out of her way to present a fair synopsis of how the police feel pressured to lock down a case for trial, even though loose ends are bothersome.  If Jacobs' interest in O'Brien is waning, she's certainly set an interesting new character to follow in Deputy Wong, who feels a fish out of water as the highest ranking woman in the department, a transfer from LA and an outsider...&quot;not only was there a glass ceiling, but glass walls, too&quot;....let's hope Kim Wong returns to Jacob's dance card in the future.<br />By page 130, you are wondering how a contract kill &quot;arranger&quot;, Sid Mertz, and a Las Vegas waitress, Irene Thompson, will tie in to the plot.  Jacobs admits excerpts from both their storylines, and although you are making a connection, your suspicions don't start to crystallize until around that time.  The rest of the book is a fast-paced roller coaster, with more surprising twists at the end.<br />Bryce, the SFPD offier that Kali became interested in, in &quot;Cold Justice&quot; is back, and the relationship between the two of them stays interesting...Kali &quot;doubted she'd affected his heart so much as assaulted his ego&quot;.  Jacobs gives us the right mix of professional and personal, and the right stuff with her heroine, Kali O'Brien.<br />There's intensity in the plot of &quot;Intent to Harm&quot;, and you'll want to get to the bottom of it, as soon as possible.<br />Highly recommended....best if you've read the books in series, though.s from both their storylines, and although you are making a connection, your suspicions don't start to crystallize until around that time.

US	45979403	R3BE524U2IN9G9	0345452577	999720718	The Conspiracy Club	Books	4	2	6	N	N	Kellerman takes a break from Alex Delaware.	In his new novel, the second published in 2003, author Jonathan Kellerman starts fresh and creates an enigmatic plot surrounding a brutal serial killer. Kellerman is familiar to many mystery buffs for his psychologist hero, Alex Delaware, who works as a police consultant in a 17-book series. He's tried different threads before, most notably in 1988. Kellerman's strong ties to Judaism sometimes shine through in his novels, but are not featured, as is the case in wife Faye Kellerman's writings. Religious faith does not play a role in this newest book, but Kellerman keeps it rooted in something he knows much about, psychology.<br />Jeremy Carrier is a hospital psychologist. He's still trying to find his way back into the life he once led, after his girlfriend, nurse Jocelyn Banks, has been brutally murdered. While stumbling through his days, he is befriended by well-known Dr. Arthur Chess, a pathologist old enough to have retired from the hospital, who is sort of an emeritus on hospital committees. Jeremy's initially puzzled by Chess' interest in him.<br />Chess is Jeremy's entree into a secret society of oldsters who are all stars in their own professions, and retired. It takes most of the book for Jeremy to determine what ties them together in &quot;conspiracy&quot; and how he fits it the scheme of things.<br />When Chess goes traveling, a series of enigmatic clues to other murders, similar to Jocelyn's, begin to disturb Jeremy's days. He can't help but wonder what role Chess plays in the mystery. In a parallel plot, Jeremy meets an interesting new love in resident Angela Rios. Between his relationship with her, and his willingness to be drawn into the murder mystery, Jeremy finds himself putting his own life on the line. In addition to an engrossing plot, Kellerman has created a young practitioner with feeling towards his patients and signifcant skill in making a difference.<br />Some Kellerman-like touches (Carrier drives an old Nova; shades of Delaware's vintage Cadillac! Carrier, instead of being enlisted by police detectives to help solve the murders, is actually a viable suspect, but ends up assisting the police.)are present, and you have a nice, tight tale of homicide with a surprise villain and the possiblity of a new series. In particular, the colorful members of the &quot;Conspiracy Club&quot; could be utilized in future books.<br />It seems as though, judging from other reviews, that many of Kellerman's loyalists disagree with my rating.<br />Most probably it is because they just wanted another instalment in Delaware's continuing saga, since the last three books in the series (&quot;Flesh and Blood&quot;, the excellent &quot;The Murder Book&quot; and &quot;A Cold Heart&quot;) have revived the series from the total drek that Kellerman created in books 10-14. I think many readers gave up on him during that spate. By contrast, I'm intrigued by the fact that he's given the reader a viable alternative to his older series, and hope he continues to revisit Jeremy Carrier in future work.<br />Nice work!ge Cadillac!

US	45979403	R17EBU23QYZUF9	034543448X	437097764	Demolition Angel	Books	5	3	3	N	Y	Carol Starkey is a detective.  She's also a drunk.	The books of Robert Crais are a revelation in series mystery/thrillers. Friends recommended his satirical, well-sketched detective, Elvis Cole to me some months ago. It took me a little while to speed through the eight novels that feature Cole and his mystery partner, Joe Pike, and I couldn't wait for more! Crais departed from his success with Cole to write two non-series novels in recent years. Each featured a different main character (&quot;Demolition Angel&quot; and &quot;Hostage&quot;). Many novelists fail in their attempts to develop beyond a one-dimensional character focus, because their fans won't let them. Following the path that Michael Connelly and Harlan Coben have set, Crais proves to be the master at proving that he can create multiple marvelous story lines. The two &quot;nonseries&quot; novels met with critical acclaim and quickly hit best seller status. Of the two, I much prefer &quot;Demolition Angel&quot;.<br />Carol Starkey is the disenfranchised heroine of the book. Starkey is one of a rare breed of &quot;bomb squad&quot; cops who treat bombs like sophisticated puzzles. We join Starkey (now off the bomb squad) several years after her lover had died in a freak accident; a minor earthquake set off a bomb that Starkey and Sugar are trying to assess and defuse. Starkey died that day, as well, but they somehow revived her. She's not sure that was a good thing. Since the accident, Starkey's been a walking disaster area; subsisting on Tagamet, coffee and cigarettes, her failures at therapy and her unwillingness to form any meaningful relationships are destroying her energy, in the same way that liquor is destroying her career. Starkey is a drunk.<br />Another squad technician, Charles Riggio, is fatally blown up by an explosive device as the novel opens. The device bears the signature of madman bomber &quot;Mr. Red&quot;. The reader is allowed to spend some time exploring the theory before being introduced to Mr. Red, himself. Complicating the search for the bomber, and toying with Starkey's emotions, is an ATF agent, Jack Pell, who's an expert on Mr. Red.<br />It's Starkey's case. Solving it will cause her to relive the most horrible day of her life. Many of the leads she turns up are false, and it seems that even Pell wants her to take the easy way out in solving a series of explosions that are devastating the landscape. The powerful story of how Carol Starkey breaks through the pain to follow her instincts without losing her life, will haunt you for days, once the tale is finished.<br />An excellent introduction to Crais that will make you want to get involved with Elvis Cole, as well!<br />One of his best, and that's saying a lot!or the bomber, and toying with Starkey's emotions, is an ATF agent, Jack Pell, who's an expert on Mr. Red. <br />It's Starkey's case.

Not only does Muller not allow her series to become stale, I really am of the opinion that each successive book in the Sharon McCone series is better than the last. McCone is a satisfying heroine who has grown into her success as the head of her own investigative agency in San Francisco. Unmarried, McCone has not fallen prey to the lack of family ties and relationships that many other females in detective series seem to have in common. McCone's family is large and seems to be in a state of crisis, as most real families are.<br />In Dead Midnight, Sharon must investigate a suicide before she has fully recovered from her reaction to her own brother Joey's suicide just one week before. The Nagasawa family has decided to open an inquiry into the apparent suicide of their son Roger, some two months after his death. Their actions are provoked by a friend of Roger's, Jody Houston, who claims Roger's employers at dot.com magazine &quot;InSite&quot; were somehow entwined with the reasons Roger's life was ended.<br />Through Roger's journal and the eyes of his family and friends, McCone comes to know a self-absorbed young man who is over his head in the secrets that permeate the Insite company. Working with investigative reporter and friend J.D. Smith, McCone unveils unethical business practices, petty office hierarchies and eventually, the reason for Roger's death. Along the way, brief appearances from McCone's cast of comrades (Hy, Ricky and Rae, Charlotte and Mick, and the gang) help her stay grounded while narrowing the search, and trying not to shoulder the blame for Joey's death.<br />A lot of the bitterness and loneliness that invades the female private detective stereotype is not present in McCone, who has taken a lot in stride, both professionally and personally, throughout the long tenure of the popular series. McCone seems to gather wisdom and strength from the bumps in her particular road, much as real women do in middle age. Lastly, the identity of Roger's enemy continues to be a mystery, right up until the very end, keeping the reader engrossed far into the night! At novel's end, McCone is able to come to terms with her own loss and move on with her life.<br />Marcia Muller is an award-winning author because her timing, plotline, and ability to weave familial story lines into police procedurals are unique and satisfying. Dead Midnight leaves you hungry for more! If you haven't read Muller, it's worth a trip back to see a much younger (and more &quot;unwise&quot;) McCone in the first novel of the series &quot;Edwin of the Iron Shoes&quot;.my continues to be a mystery, right up until the very end, keeping the reader engrossed far into the night!

I understand that Anna Gavalda is French, and the evidence is her wry, Gallic humor and tendency to understate the obvious in her stories.  Ostensibly a collection of love stories, Gavalda's collection really runs the gamut of many emotions.<br />  Some leave you rueful, others make you wish she had stretched them out and made even more of the story.  Some shock--&quot;Catgut&quot; is an example of an emotionally charged story of horror and revenge.  &quot;Junior&quot; is a sad story of a young man's folly -- and not a misstep with love.  My favorites of the collection are &quot;For Years&quot;, as a man meets his lost love, and learns she is dying, &quot;Pregnant&quot;, a tale of shock and sadness that many of us have had to face, and the lead tale, &quot;Courting Rituals of the Saint-Germain-des-Pres&quot;, in which a young woman surfaces her doubts about love at first sight by finding a cellular pretense to leave a man she is attracted to.<br />Gavalda has an interesting, rich voice, slants her stories from several perspectives, keeps you refreshed and reading.  When you are finished, disappointment that there is no more lets you know that you are truly in the presence of a great young writer.<br />Exciting, bold, makes you want to read more by Gavalda!	2003-12-27

Once in awhile, I reread a book that, in retrospect, has made a big impact on my reading &quot;consciousness&quot;.  Such a book is Sue Monk Kidd's &quot;The Secret Life of Bees&quot;.  Deceptively simple in its execution, Kidd's first work of fiction is a touching coming of age tale of young Lily Owens, bereft of a mother she can barely remember.  Lily escapes abuse at the hands of her father T.Ray, and takes along the black woman, Rosaleen, who has cared for her since her mother died.  Set in the late 60's, when the cause for civil rights was alive and bleeding in the nation, Lily's story of the search for her mother's real truth coincides with the struggle for civil rights in rural South Carolina.<br />Lily finds shelter, warmth, and perhaps a lifelong vocation in the home of three African-American sisters, all a little damaged by life.  It isn't until she's lived with them for some time that she comes to know what they meant to her mother, as well.  Kidd's symbolism, ability to create the bond between women with her words, and her well-researched use of the religious power of the sisters' symbol, a black Madonna, can be compared to some of the great writers of our time.  I find her story of love, hope and integrity, set in an ambiguously racial<br />setting, to be reminiscent of Harper Lee in &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;.  And although Kidd lacks a strong masculine figure in the manner of Atticus (one reason why the book may not resonate as well with a male audience), she can tell a tale of quiet heroism as well as the finest.<br />This holiday reading was my second of Kidd's beautiful book.  There will doubtless be many more.	2003-12-27
US	45979403	RPKLY21K5LUT4	0679428895	451458080	Pompeii: A Novel	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Pompeii is a captivating read	from author Richard Harris.  Harris has previously written three novels of historical fiction, set in WWII, and postwar.  This time he's far more ambitious with his setting, returning to the Roman Empire of A.D. 79.  Too few works about ancient Rome focus on the amazing engineering feats achieved by the empire; most focus on the battles, the slaves and gladiators, the cracks in the armor that eventually led to the fall of the Empire.  Harris centers his work on the wonder of the Roman water system, dependent on a series of magnificent aqueducts that supported the needs of the people, and were truly a mark of engineering genius.<br />Harris' first novel, \\"Fatherland\\" always stands out for me in the amazing niche it filled - a novel of historical fiction that attempted to answer the question -- what would have happened if Hitler won the war?  Although new novelist Harris was unable to bring his talents and imagination for setting and conflict to his characterization of the main characters, it was forgiveable in light of the stunning impact of his work.  His following two historical novels, \\"Enigma\\" and \\"Archangel\\" were interesting, but mere shadows of his promise from \\"Fatherland\\".<br />Here, now, many years later, Harris brings us in with the tale too often ignored in our historical view -- the incredible eruption of the volcano Vesuvius that destroyed the Roman city of Pompeii.  In his hero, Marcus Attilus Primus, an engineer newly assigned to the Aqua Augusta in the days before the eruption, Harris has created a character complex and equal to the tale and the impressive research he did and shares with us about the aqueduct, the times, and the eruption.  It is a tale that draws you in and won't let you go.  Flawed by lack of appropriate motive and characterization of the supporting roles, Pompeii is nevertheless a delicious read of historical nonfiction.<br />You'll enjoy!	2003-12-23

This is the fourth book in series from author Sheldon Siegel about whimsical &quot;couple&quot; Rosie Fernandez and Mike Daley.  The plot is tight, involves the Siegel signature homicide, and characters from Mike and Rosie's past.  The courtroom scenes are well-paced and the plot ticks off like clockwork.  Small surprises crop up throughout the book, and Siegel's mechanism of writing in the Mike Daley first person is, as usual, the joy of the novel.<br />Daley and Siegel share the same dry sense of humor and comic timing.  The newspaper quote at the front of each chapter probably underline the type of humor that is evident from the first page.  At the end of each chapter there's a mini &quot;cliff-hanger&quot; that makes the chapter transitions enjoyable, and probably is the reason why you can't put a Siegel book down.<br />Some of the quotes come from Siegel's larger than life characters, Nick Hanson and Kaela Joy Gullion...here's one:<br />&quot;A PI must be exceedingly patient and have unlimited capacity for staying awake.  It's also helpful if you learn not to use the bathroom for extended periods.&quot;...Kaela Joy Gullion, profile in the San Francisco Chronicle.<br />With tongue in cheek, Siegel brings another novel to a smashing conclusion, and succeeds in keeping the reader interested in one of the oddest romances (Mike &amp; Rosie) on the page.<br />You'll enjoy it!	2003-12-03

I can't say I really enjoyed &quot;The Pleasure of My Company&quot;, and much preferred Martin's first work, &quot;Shopgirl&quot;. I'm not sure that many people would read this book, if it weren't for the author's fame in comedy. But it is worth a read, particularly if you know someone that has OCD, which generally escalates as people reach the age where they have to begin their own, independent lives. Martin has a light touch with his humor, although he has difficulty with the resolution of his stories, preferring to paint the characters in depth, and then just fade away. Since he can do that in comedy, but not in novels, he is not as successful here.<br />The hero of Steve Martin's new novel (novella? only 163 pages) suffers from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and has a tad of the autistic savant thrown in for good measure. Daniel's somehow ended up living alone in Santa Monica...<br />&quot;Santa Monica, California, where I live, is a perfect town for invalids, homosexuals, show people, and all other formerly peripheral members of society. Average is not the norm here.&quot;<br />Living alone, Daniel doesn't have a job anymore, although he used to use his skills as a math wizard at Hewlett-Packard, where he was employed as a business communique encoder. He had to leave that job when he weaned himself off his meds and he could no longer allow himself to create a code whose ultimate end was to be decoded. Now Daniel lives on public assistance, with help from periodic cash infusions from his Granny.<br />There are several wonderful treatises on Daniel's trips to the Rite-Aid, which is &quot;splendidly antiseptic&quot;. We suffer through his neuroses every time he steps outside his apartment, in trips which must be planned perfectly, to not upset his equilibrium. Much of his inner voicing is consumed with his attraction to a variety of females who slide in and out of the periphery of his existence.<br />Martin has a writing style that throws out the edge of Daniel's obsessions in a disarming way.<br />&quot;The next morning, I decided to touch every corner of every copying machine at Kinko's...&quot;,<br />and he treats his hero gently, with feeling. Somewhat funny, and somewhat poignant, Daniel's life escalates quickly at the end of the book, in an almost too pat fashion, but then, without the happy ending, it would be pointless to explore Daniel's world and walk away unhappy.<br />Recommended with reservations - don't expect it to be wildly funny.

I had to find out about it from another Amazon reviewer.<br />David Rosenfeldt has hero Andy Carpenter involved in a whodunit within a whodunit.  There's a personal stake when lawyer Carpenter's investigator and lover, Laurie Collins, is accused of the brutal slaying of a cop who crossed her when she was on the police force.  Andy's dog Tara is back, and we learn how his life has changed since he inherited $22 million of \\"dirty money\\" from his father.  Solicitations from charities like the \\"Committee to Save the Otters of Guatemala Bay\\" impinge on his time, sometimes even interrupting the non-stop flow of NBA and college basketball games on his new large-screen TV.<br />Rosenfeldt's biggest talent is not necessarily mystery, it's comedy.  He has an incredibly funny way with words, and each character that Carpenter surrounds himself with is someone who connects with Andy's humor.  Andy drops non sequiturs frequently, and gently baits people to keep up a running line of humor that is cynical and funny. Andy has an ongoing \\"song-talk\\" contest with Sam, his accountant, where they use song lyrics in conversation.  Put this together with characters like sexy Rita Golden, the court clerk, and cousin Fred, who is the investment genius for Andy's money, and....well, you just have to be there for the humor.<br />The plot does go over the top, from time to time, another Rosenfeldt comedic device.  While characters are real, situations, in retrospect, go above and beyond the norm.<br />Getting Laurie's house arrest, so that she stays with him while he defends her is one of these devices, but it enhances both the feeling of misery during the trial, and the odd situation Andy's in when Laurie can't help him investigate.  There are other quirky couplings in the book -- Andy's client Willie Miller, from the first novel, is now sueing his ex-wife's father and his partner for over $10 million; it makes for interesting dialogue between Andy and Nicole.  There's also the serious, in the way that Andy regrets getting his friends involved in his cases, when Sam's assistant Barry, is harmed while conducting part of the investigation.<br />All in all, \\"First Degree\\" is a fast and enjoyable sequel, proving that David Rosenfeldt is not a one shot wonder (\\"Open and Shut\\" was nominated for an Edgar Award), and I look forward to more from him before the bestseller world finds him and turns him into a book machine.<br />5 big stars!y and Nicole.

The writer's job is \\"to turn the unspeakable into words--not just into any words, but if we can, nto rhythm and blues\\"- Anne Lamott.<br />In this somewhat controversial collection of stories, the authors have fulfilled the mission that Lamott sets for writers, above.  Wally Lamb, prize-winning \\"Oprah\\" author of \\"I Know This Much Is True\\" and \\"She's Come Undone\\" has acted as teacher, mentor and inspirational leader at a writing workshop in a women's prison in Connecticut.  He's compiled an anthology of stories from 10 incarcerated in prison, and a woman who teaches in the prison.  To say that the collection is stunning is an understatement.<br />Wanting to keep in tune with Connecticut's \\"Son of Sam\\" law, that does not allow writers to profit from writing about their crimes, Lamb successfully keep their focus on the tales of their early lives, and each woman's coming face to face with what she did and what her life will be like in prison.  There are no sad-sack, pity me stories here.  What you will learn is that there are painful incidents in these women's childhoods, that they are finally able to face on paper.  They hold themselves accountable for what they've done, and they use their craft to provide not only their own inspiration, but inspirational thoughts for women everywhere.<br />\\"Orbiting Izzy\\" - one of two stories from former inmate Nancy Whitely is the piece that sold the idea to Lamb's publisher.  Whitely may have the freshest voice of all the authors represented, but you will find evocative moments in each woman's tale.  Following the story, there is an information piece about each author, and it is astounding that these women have all found not only their voices, but their hopes for the future in all of the accomplishments they've made while incarcerated.<br />This collection is not to be missed by anyone who has struggled to find themselves as an adult-- it is a gift of faith and humility for us all.<br />From author Brenda Medina:<br />\\"Beyond the steel door, there's a mourning<br />  Grief for misplaced innocence....<br /> Past the bright light, there's a longing<br />  One that will not go away ...\\"<br />The collage cover of the book was also made by inmates as replicas of the Mona Lisa.  It is a testament to women who's lives were shattered, coming together to make a perfect illustration of the wondrous words inside this book.eel door, there's a mourning<BR>  Grief for misplaced innocence....<br /> Past the bright light, there's a longing<BR>  One that will not go away ...\\"<br />The collage cover of the book was also made by inmates as replicas of the Mona Lisa.

Started over 75 years ago by Robert Frost and Will Cather, it is s starting point for fine writing.  The conference and its established poets and writers support new voices, and the endowment of a West Virginia patron, Katherine Bakeless Nason, has allowed for competitive prizes awarded by a single, distinguished judge.<br />&quot;Crackpots&quot;, won the Bakeless award for fiction in 2002.  There is little wonder why Sara Pritchard, writing under her own name, was considered to be the finest new fiction writer of the year.  Pritchard is passionate about words, a passion she imbues upon her heroine, Ruby Reese (semi-autobiographical?)In her tale, she weaves a complex portrait of Ruby and some family members and friends that surround her during her lifetime.  She has an amazing way of bringing together small threads of life in the 50's and 60's, the ways in which she thought, as a child, and placing them out there, in your consciousness, so you will remember, too.  I'm grateful to Pritchard for helping me to remember things such as old Judy Collins songs, the way in which children substitute everyday words for colloquial words in the hymns they learn (&quot;Bringing in the cheese...instead of sheaves!&quot;)and the beauty of falling in love with words(Some of Ruby's choices: taffeta, gladiola, nincompoop).<br />That said, Pritchard tries too hard to demonstrate an original voice - slipping from first to second to third person, and layering seemingly childhood incidents with those of the present day, asking her readers to find the common thread.  Although her style is arresting, and probably very much the way that crackpot Ruby thinks, it becomes tedious.  Just when you read a passage that takes your breath away:<br /> &quot;The song is over, but my mother is still singing it.  The song is spinning around Jackson Circle like it's a carousel calliope or a music box playing, floating through the cedar trees and out into the marsh. It's hanging like threads caught on the briars at the edge of the marsh, thr briars sticking to the hem of the universe.&quot;<br />You are suddenly thrown into the harsh world of Ruby's first marriage, where her husband's anger and jealousy led to furtive peeks into the world of domestic violence.<br />There are just too many contrasts and layers, too much to befuddle (Ruby would love that word) the reader.  As such, the book breaks down into some incredibly memorable vignettes and characters -- some evocative dialogue, loosely held together.  It tires you out.  You'll put it down often and convince yourself to finish, not for the tale, but for the quality of Pritchard's writing.<br />Beautifully conceived, lyrical writing = 5 stars.<br />Confusing, tedious, trying too hard for originality = 2 stars.<br />Overall, a 3 star effort.  I'm not sure the Bakeless Award was given fairly.nd out into the marsh.

I grabbed and gobbled Sabin Willet's newest, &quot;Present Value&quot;.  Wolfe's &quot;Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; is the testament to high-priced American greed gone bad (please, please don't see the movie!).  Willett starts out on a very promising note.  He's witty and sharp, and he sets his parable to Enron's story in a well-grounded toy distribution company.  How the company has positioned itself for disaster by catering to all the current American corporate fads (an attorney that shadows the CEO at all times, so that everything said is privileged, the &quot;off the books&quot; subsidiaries, all venture capital deals, the need to find some third quarter revenue SOMEWHERE so that everyone's stock options won't be disturbed, etc.)is at the core of this corporate fairy tale gone bad.<br />In chapter one, Willett's sarcastic wit shines through as he describes the ritual of his hero, Fritz Brubaker, dropping off the children (Precious Cargo) at their exclusive private school.  His treatise on the massive, fully-equipped line of SUV's is exceeded only by him revealing the brattiness of his spoiled offspring.  We move on with nice-guy Fritz opening up his eyes (finally) to the difficulties in his marriage, where his wife Linda is more fond of her Blackberry device than she is of him, and the ethics of the company he works for are seriously in question.<br />The Brubaker family is headed for a fall, and in a thinly disguised plot twist, the weight of the white collar crime that brings them to their knees all falls on Fritz.  As Fritz makes a couple of legendary appearances in court, the story recaps how he got to this place, including his entanglement with a wife that resembles a shark more than a feminine ideal.  Through<br />it all, Willett's skill at making you care about Fritz, and the lightning quick speed with which his life falls apart, keeps you reading without pause.<br />The story starts to turn south with the introduction of Ronnie, a private investigator.  Ronnie doesn't fit into the story, and the subplot between her and Fritz adds a jarring note.  Despite this, Willett winds to the end of Fritz's incarceration, keeping things light, and letting the reader wonder whether the Brubakers will ever be able to set things right again.<br />A fine read, a light touch, but no Thomas Wolfe here.  Just a clever novel that feeds our fascination with the ethical malaise in American corporations.onnie doesn't fit into the story, and the subplot between her and Fritz adds a jarring note.

US	45979403	RPG1OIIXTN94J	0446531316	822131758	Street Dreams (Kellerman, Faye)	Books	5	33	37	N	Y	I've been really disappointed....	in the way Kellerman had let this series meander in her last two outings \\"The Forgotten\\" and \\"Stone Kiss\\".  Unlike many of the other readers I want to applaud this latest effort, picking up on Cindy Decker as the main character, and continuing her story from \\"Stalker\\".<br />It is true that if you haven't read the series, this book won't work for you.  But like many patient readers of \\"series\\" mystery and thrillers, I get a little tired of the time and effort spent recapping the series for new readers.  At some point, (and this is the 16th book in series), an author needs to cater to the fans that have been loyal enough to follow the series.....so, the action picks up without a lot of background noise on either Cindy or parents Peter/Rina -- a welcome relief.<br />Cindy's police work is supplemented this time by a much more realistic love story than her affair with a detective in \\"Stalker\\".  Koby, the man she meets and falls in love with, is perhaps drawn too physically, but the sexual energy and attraction between them shines through, much like the early books portrayed the link between Peter and Rina.  For once, Peter and Rina take a trip/vacation where there is no need for police work, and no family to \\"save\\" (thank goodness!)...their backdrop of searching for Rina's family past in Europe is a nice, humanistic setting for the primary story.<br />Cindy's got an interesting, realistic crime to solve, and there is some danger, along with a lot of help and advice from her father and Koby.  The book moves rapidly, with the love and family stories seamlessly meshing with the police work.<br />If Kellerman can follow this book up with a winner, starring the new couple, she might be the first contemporary serial writer to successfully move her stories from one generation to another; an interesting accomplishment.<br />More!	2003-09-22
US	45979403	R2LP0FM75YKINH	0743234693	844233229	The Footprints of God	Books	3	3	5	N	Y	Surprised....	I was surprised by the jumble of plots, twists and scenarios of the latest Greg Iles' novel. As he ambitiously delves into the thriller-philosophy mix (ala Crichton), he leaves behind the rich characterizations that heightened the quality of his previous work.  David Tennant and Rachel (who was his psychiatrist before they fell in love (??))) are simply caricatures, with no real texture in their relationship.  The two characters who ARE the most colorful, Arthur Fielding, a prize winning scientist, and David's friend, and his wife, Lu Li, both disappear into the action involving the project to build a supercomputer that will control the world.<br />I give it 3 stars, which is a little much, because I really stayed wrapped up in the subplot about David's dreams of Jesus, where he finds himself suffering through the last days of Christ.  When the story turns to Israel, you believe the mists will lift and the the plot will come together.  It doesn't.<br />To add insult to injury, Iles adds a couple of quasi-functional villains, Geli Bauer, an assassin, and her boss, Peter Godin and her crazy military father, General Bauer.  None of them feel<br />the least bit realistic.<br />In attempting to combine a science/religion doomsday theme, with a thriller about how one man can stop the madness, Iles loses us in the muck.  A disappointment from a great storyteller, although I applaud his willingness to take a risk at a slightly different genre.	2003-09-12

Italian girls raised in a non-traditional family, Mary, Helen and Gracie are closer than close.<br />Louisa Ermelino, author of &quot;The Black Madonna&quot;, gives us a sweeping look at the Irish and Italian neighborhoods of 1930's NYC, when the girls were children, and backdrops their stories in the 1950's, when they've chosen very different ways of life.<br />Ermelino's female characters are complex and bold; even Anona, the liquor-loving grandmother of the sisters, who raised them from childhood.  Helen and Mary show sparks you never saw in the women of the 50's movies, and both dote on youngest sister Gracie, who had the misfortune to fall in love with Frankie Merelli.  The men in their lives, aside from Frankie, are merely sketches, but there is action, vengeance, and plotting worthy of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; in this group of sisters.<br />Peppered with Italian phrases and scenes from Hells Kitchen to the Stork Club and the Copa, Ermelino's story will make you visualize the movie well before you get to the end of the book.

The plot and characters sizzle and the authors (mother-daughter team of PJ and Tracy Lambrecht) have set the thriller in Minneapolis/St.Paul-Wisconsin, one of my favorite areas, and the stomping grounds of Lucas Davenport of the &quot;Prey&quot; series.<br />For new authors, the team is excellent at weaving multiple plotlines together, and the team of 5 software developers that is at risk, and who have created risk for others, is an intriguing and slightly comic group (that apparently will be back for at least 2 sequels).  Monkeewrench has gotten a lot of critical praise, some of it over-the-top, when comparing its comic touch to that of Evanovich.  Make no mistake, this is a dead serious thriller, whose writers have a light and humorous way with words and descriptions.  They don't populate the book with cartoon characters (no offense to Evanovich, I love her work).  Here's a sample of the kind of descriptive turn that grabs your senses while you work through the plot:<br />&quot;...the room was an olfactory museum of hundreds of meetings just like this one.  Fast food, sweat, and the now-forbidden cigarette smoke -- all these smells and more seeped from the plaster walls and rose from the uneven waves of the warped wooden floor. &quot;<br />You'll enjoy cops Magozzi, a Mpls. detective and his soft-hearted partner, Gino Rolseth, as well as Wisconsin sheriff Mike Halloran.  Mostly though, you'll be annoyed at the sleep you miss, since Monkeewrench is one of those books you can't put down once you start.  Plot twists and turns are exciting, and while the eventual discovery of the killer's identity is a little surreal, it makes for a great whodunit.<br />Looking forward to more from this writing team; their debut was spectacular!!!	2003-07-26

I was a little worried that Evanovich was losing steam in her series, with the acceptable &quot;7 &amp; 8&quot; books, and the mediocre &quot;Visions of Sugar Plums&quot;.  She restores my faith in the ninth tale of crazy bounty hunter Stephanie Plum.  Comedy is mixed with a real plot this time, and there are some &quot;spoiler&quot; decisions that Evanovich makes on Stephanie's love life, car situation, and hairdo that I just can't bring myself to reveal.<br />It's a deft, quick read that takes Plum from Trenton to Las Vegas, and although you may solve the identity of the killer before Plum does, your trepidation will grow with hers through a series of body guards assigned to keep her safe, and the dead bodies that keep piling up.  Special comedy awards still go to Grandma Mazur and Morelli's Grandma Bella -- and Lula and Connie shine in this tale, full of the ongoing determination of Lula's to become a supermodel with a quasi-Atkins eating experience.<br />Evanovich has lost none of the comic touch from her previous outings, but stops treating Plum's career as a series of bumbles, and gives rise to a real conflict and case that should send the book's &quot;stock&quot; skyrocketing.<br />Get it, read it, don't delay!!!	2003-07-22

She's alone with her family in Minneapolis when things begin to unravel.  Her journey through the devastation of her husband's manic depression and the slow-motion truth of daughter Maeve's autism will leave you emotionally bereft, in the same pattern that it leaves Bridget.

I decided to go back to my favorite book from a couple of years ago, the hugely successful &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; by author Laura Hillenbrand.  I perhaps enjoyed it even more than the first read, and look forward with great anticipation to the release of the film this summer.<br />Although Hillenbrand has a tendency to &quot;over adjective&quot; in many instances, her story of a group of also-rans, two men and a horse, coupled with two men with &quot;the golden touch&quot;, is a deeply satisfying read.  Hillenbrand couches the piece with a<br />heads-on review of the country in the 20's and 30's, something today's filmgoers could use an idea of!  When the charismatic Seabiscuit rises from obscurity along with worn-out Tom Smith (his trainer, and one of the most interesting characters ever in this colorful sport) and down-on-his-luck jockey Red Pollard, the American public is treated to one of those rare events, a longshot who succeeds brilliantly!  Backdrops of wealthy owner Charles Howard and winning jockey George Woolf also play major roles in this tale of an underdog.<br />But central to the whole theme is the understanding that Hillenbrand derives of the very personality of the odd horse that floundered his way up and down the rollercoaster of stardom.  She has a flair for convincing you why this particular horse should be immortalized in a nonfiction book that should experience a renaissance once the film is released!<br />A definite must for your book collection -- outstanding read!	2003-07-16

But neither can hide the extraordinary uniqueness of her voice, and the way she can turn a phrase.  She makes pictures with her words, makes thoughts come alive.  She's a talent that I hope will not get caught up in a wave of \\"single girl fiction\\", and will turn her literary sights on different points of view, different settings, so that others can explore her way with words.<br />Brichoux's got a single girl story, this one set in Boston, but Nicci, her heroine, is there in body alone.  In mind she is flight, touching down on childhood, on life in the Phillipines, on Hong Kong, on loneliness.  She defines herself as a \\"fringe person\\", but the depth of her is shown in the way others draw to her.  She has a triangle in the book, and is forthright and knowing of the difference between who she makes love to and who she loves.<br />Her relationship with her grandfather is crisp and genuine, and his personification of \\"shoes\\" with people is a generational version of her own \\"kung fu movies\\" with people's reaction to them.  I thought for awhile I might be one of the few women to understand the difference between the meaning of Jackie Chan movies made in the Far East, in Chinese, and the slapdash kung fu movies  he does for American audiences.  Not so...and if you read \\"Coffee and Kung Fu\\", you will find it out for yourself.<br />Brichoux's dialogue is believable, and scattered throughout the first person narrative in just the right amounts, and some of her literary comparisons will stay with you a long time, whether humorous:<br /> \\"Maybe it's because November drew Thanksgiving in the holiday lottery.....November got ripped off.  What kind of holiday is it when you're supposed to celebrate genocide by stuffing yourself??\\"<br />or poetic:<br />  \\"She's had the moment.  A moment isn't a piece of time, it's a question.

Finishing this &quot;Harry Bosch&quot; novel, your sense is he might even take a bigger risk in the next book...by moving Bosch from LA to Las Vegas.  Now, LA is synonymous with Connelly in the way that Boston is with Robert Parker, so that will be another leap.<br />But Connelly definitely wanted Harry to go in another direction...as a private investigator, Harry can be as much of a bull in a china shop, as much of a full-speed ahead guy, as he was as a cop.  Only now there's no one to tell him &quot;No&quot;.  An old FBI &quot;pal&quot;, Lindell says it best --when he accuses Bosch of putting himself in the path of the murderers, because he wants to take them on...&quot;he wanted them to come after him....He's always been a private investigator, even when he carried a badge&quot;.<br />So, at the age of 52, as grumpy and sarcastic as he's always been, as unlucky in love, as haunted by homicide that can't be solved as he's ever been, Harry's got a new lease on life.<br />The plot here is interwoven, and we go up blind alleys with Harry.  It becomes obvious who the killers are, but there's an end twist between Bosch and the old paralyzed cop who enticed him to open the cold case (Lawton Cross) that will make you feel as hollow as Harry must feel.  Jazz still plays an intrinsic role in Harry's life, and the women who are important to him, Kiz Rider, Keisha Russell and Eleanor Wish all make appearances.<br />I'm definitely tuned in to the change to first person storytelling that Connelly uses, now that Harry is out on his own.  We get inside Harry's head more this way.  And Connelly skillfully touches on a current political issue as he always does; this time Homeland Security and the potentially disastrous losses of citizen's rights that it may impose.<br />I raced through Lost Light and think it may be Connelly's best since &quot;The Concrete Blonde&quot;, and that's saying a lot...there's no &quot;loss of light&quot; here.<br />Don't delay, and don't skip it, even if you've not experimented with Bosch before.  It's tense, satisfying, and altogether deserves a 5 star rating!pose.<br />I raced through Lost Light and think it may be Connelly's best since &quot;The Concrete Blonde&quot;, and that's saying a lot...there's no &quot;loss of light&quot; here. <br />Don't delay, and don't skip it, even if you've not experimented with Bosch before.

Unlike Michael Connelly, Kellerman just can't seem to take the risks with Delaware that he needs to take to keep the series fresh and compelling.  Still, I'm giving the book four stars...<br />Delaware is the one who makes the leap in this mystery to connect seemingly unrelated homicide cases.  He draws old friend Milo Sturgis and another former character, Petra Connor, (who makes a welcome return) into the mix, along with Connor's new and unusual partner.  Focused on the arts and music, the victims of the killer have their lives taken from them mysteriously, by a killer who may just be jealous of their recent successes.<br />Sadly, Delaware, who has a new love in his life, can't seem to draw away from Robin Castagna, both personally and professionally, although many Delaware fans are hoping that Kellerman will \\"Give it up!\\" on their troubled romance.  Robin's new love is a bit of an oddity, as well, who keeps getting in Delaware's way.<br />The mystery is just compelling enough, and the action realistic, to hold your interest, although Kellerman, who has now completed the last four books in the series with some of the style and characterization he had in the early going of the series, falls short of \\"The Murder Book\\".  It may be time for Delaware to return to the field of crimes against children, where his original psychological skills best focused.<br />You'll not regret the read, and you'll finish quickly, but unlike some of his earlier work, it won't leave you with regrets that it will be awhile before Alex's next outing.	2003-06-19

Wisely, although Sandford went forward with these changes, the impact was streamlined by having 90% of the book's action happen in rural northern Minnesota, in the fictional small town of Broderick.  Family man Lucas still has his best sidekick, Del, gainfully employed with him -- and married or not, he still can spot and appreciate a great looking woman.  Some things never change!<br />The first two murders may be motivated by racial hatred - one victim is black, and his significant other is white...they are found brutally slain and hanging from a barren tree in the frosty Minnesota winter.  There's so much odd and unusual \\"stuff\\" going on in Broderick, it's difficult for Lucas & Del to pin down the any information about the murders, and the killings continue.<br />Sandford manages to deftly interweave his social viewpoints -- his lack of respect for the media, his vague unsettlement with the way that federal, state and local authorities sometimes impede each other to solve a case that has generated media attention, and most importantly, his support of a little known grass roots campaign that is quietly smuggling prescription drugs from Canada to US patients who need and can't afford them.<br />Unlike many other writers of this genre, Sandford can keep both his tale of the crime and his social commentary moving in the same direction -- one does not eclipse or slow down the other.<br />The book is also notable in that it provides a lot of insight into tribal casinos...a staple of the Minnesota scenery in the last decade.  Tribal casinos have changed rural Minnesota in many ways, and Sandford captures this contrast of big city activity with the rural tundra.<br />The prize of the novel, as many readers have commented, is new character Letty West, who will doubtless appear in future instalments.  A precocious 12-year old, Letty's like many rural kids that come from dysfunctional single parent families....in the cities, kids from these homes tend to run with gangs...in the country, they tend to be loners, with old souls.  Letty is such a character, and she's the best addition to the series in a long time.<br />This may not be the finest of Sandford's series, but its darn close!

Coben is a long-time favorite, but this book falls short of his prior two thrillers and even the Myron Bolitar series.  It does hold your interest to the end, because of the plot's twists and turns.<br />I think Marc Seidman, Coben's hero, is the main problem.  Although he's given to some sarcastic humor (ala Myron Bolitar),<br />he's not very well-defined and its hard to see what his old friends (former girlfriend turned FBI agent and his attorney)<br />see in him to keep them so loyal.  His job, as a reconstructive plastic surgeon who, with his partner, travels the world to aid<br />those in need, is a great touch.  His wife, Monica, is killed at the start of the book, in a robbery that wounds Seidman severely, and winds up with his small daughter missing. His quest for his daughter rings true to his feelings about her, but is not enough to save the book.<br />That he'd be married to Monica seems implausible.  The cadre of villains here include an unbelievable duo of a woman who is a former child star turned mercenary, and her hulking partner, who is also her lover.  Coben spends a lot of time interspersing chapters from their point of view, and they are not realistic.<br />Like other reviewers, I'm a fan of bit-part character Verne (think Chris Cooper) a redneck gunowner with an Eastern European bride, who gets drawn into the action simply because he's drawn to Seidman's plight.<br />I think Coben may have rushed this book to publication, and I hope he'll slow down and create a more plausible story with a better hero in the next round.  (Or, he could bring Myron and Win back!)<br />3 1/2 stars!	2003-05-27

Although I'm not prone to reading short stories, anything by author Michael Malone is usually priceless.  This collection is no exception.  A terrific concept is this, the grouping of Malone's fictional observations of a dozen Southern women, as diverse a group as the real tapestry of women in the south.<br />Led by Malone's award-winning \\"Stella, Red Clay\\" - which is more of a look into the relationship between a father and son, both of whom admire ex-Hollywood star Stella, from a distance, this story was worth the price of the book and definitely deserved the two national awards it garnered.  In the collection, about 7 of the pieces are well-developed, and the rest fall a little short of the artistry you've come to expect from Malone's novels.  My personal favorite was the look into the soul of a battered woman in \\"Charmain, White Trash Noir\\" - Malone perfectly captures the lack of self-esteem, yet the ladylike manner a real Charmain would display when confronted with the dilemma of airing her marital dirty laundry in order to save herself from a conviction.<br />I granted 4 instead of 5 stars because I particularly disliked the snapshot of Malone's \\"Justin-Cuddy\\" series...all about a local deb in Hillston (Patty, Love & Other Crimes).  It definitely did not do the series justice.<br />From the creation of the concept, the cleverness of the cover in the oversize paperback, the ebb and flow of Malone's poetry written as prose, you'll enjoy this collection.  And, if you do, be sure to gather Malone's other gems, his novels, which are amazing!	2003-05-19

In 5 years, when &quot;boomers&quot; begin leaving the workforce in large numbers, and employers can<br />no longer find qualified people, or even more important, qualified people with wisdom gained from experience, there will be an employment crisis again.  Some companies have recognized this and geared their policies and opportunities accordingly.  Most have not...most have gloried in a legal system, that, by its very bureaucracy and expense, guarantees anonymity for corporations because of settlement, and very few court challenges.  Most employees are discouraged before they start.<br />Gregory's book is a valuable resource to not let yourself become discouraged!  Highly recommended!	2003-05-18

So much of Lehane's latest, &quot;Shutter Island&quot;, is tied up in the twists and turns of plot, that to write a review that summarizes the plot is tantalizing -- but will spoil the book for the next reader.<br /> Lehane apparently became an afficianado of old Sinatra, causing him to write the noir-ish &quot;Shutter Island&quot;, set in 1954.  The book is about the handling of psychiatric patients in those days, terrifying as THAT is.  Lehane's two main characters are U.S. Marshals, sent to investigate the disappearance of a woman &quot;patient&quot;, who'd been held in the Island hospital for the criminally insane.<br />Although Lehane truly develops only one character in the novel, Marshal Teddy Daniels, his deft ability to describe the motivations of others, and to electify with descriptive phrase of his setting leave you feeling that he just may be the best novelist in America today.<br />&quot;The lights went on above them in a series of liquid cracks that sounded like bones breaking underwater.  Electric charges hummed in the air and were followed by an explosion of yells<br />and catcalls and wailing....&quot; -- it'll be tough for you to get much sleep with Shutter Island in tow.  It was a fast read and I sat up far into the night to finish it...and then could not rest.  Like in his characters, Lehane sets up a momentum and a fear in you that won't let you forget this book for days.<br />I'm not surprised to see the wide variety of ratings given the book -- the best generally are controversial.

King's \\"Kate Martinelli\\" series; and bought this book to see what else she can write.  I'd not read \\"Folly\\" (although I plan to) and I found that you can treat this book about sometimes-hero Allen Carmichael as a stand alone read.  And what a read!<br />  King, through a series of writing and conversations, and, I believe, a voyage to the jungles (the \\"green\\") of Viet Nam, manages to evoke the presence of her ex-GI, Allen, and recreate the war there. Flashbacks syncopate the story of today's Allen, locked in a battle with an angry, violent father over possession of his abused, 12-year old son.  Allen's part of a network of a type of \\"underground railroad\\" for abused children.  His destiny is tied up in his memories of rage and terror from his days in Vietnam, and what's worse, his return to \\"civilization\\", as a despised Vietnam vet.  King has gotten into the deepest visceral memories of the soldiers who served there, and the analogy between Allen's former battles and his current urban battles gives the reader a strong link to his motivation.<br />\\"Six months of rage and shame flooded up through...his gut and seized his heart and his mind; six months of confusion and hatred and humiliation, long weeks of gut-shrinking terror and soul-withering frustrtion slammed together in the cleansing red emotion of savagery given a clear target\\".<br />....what terrors Allen has faced then and now are interspersed with the third/first person account of Jamie, a boy shattered by his sensitivity and knowledge of the emotional cripple that is his father.  You'll be caught up in the tense thrill of today's story, and reluctantly moved back to the jungles to see the paradox of Jamie's struggles and Allen's own.<br />A book you won't soon forget -- the evocative \\"Keeping Watch\\" - bravo for Laurie R.

It's pretty evident that he's brought something fresh and enjoyable to the table with his thriller, \\"Gray Matter\\".<br />Braver's outstanding in tone, characterization, and dialogue in his novels, but he has a way with the language that also makes you stand back and take note as he makes the setting and the Massachutsetts surroundings come to life.<br />With these skills, he writes, much more successfully than Crichton, of a cutting edge topic of medical science, with the attendant moral and ethical dilemmas raised.  The result is a heart-stopping tale that you will find difficult to put down and difficult to forget.<br />I'm the parent of learning disabled children.

Rachel's son Dylan simply has a low IQ.  He's a charming and talented child, but growing up in an upper income area, with the endless pressure that children have to succeed (from upwardly mobile parents); he's at a disadvantage.

His command of the language, his ability to interweave multiple plots, and, above all, his characterization of people in \\"the new South\\" is flawless.  Of the Justin/Cuddy trilogy, Time's Witness is by far my favorite.  Perhaps that's because the point of view is that of Cuddy Mangum, far more complex than tortured soul Justin Savile, narrarator of \\"Uncivil Seasons\\".<br />An older book that went out of print for awhile and is just now being enjoyed by a new generation of readers, \\"Time's Witness\\" covers the controversy of capital punishment, when the criminal is truly not guilty, in a way that Grisham, Turow, and many others are just getting to now.  The threads of who actually was responsible for the death of a cop, and later a civil rights activist, are sometimes a little difficult to follow.<br />But Malone keeps the complex story alive by his references to day to day small dramas, while the large plot unfolds.  His phrasing is elegant, and bringing in the funny Martha (Cuddy's dog), the personal lives of cops Nancy & Zeke, and the bond between Cuddy and inimitable attorney Isaac Rosethorn (think Robert Duvall) grounds the reality you look for in a novel, into this fine book.<br />In particular, the courtroom scenes, near the end of the novel, come to life in a way that many other \\"legal thriller\\" novelists would love to emulate.  Rising above all is the way Malone brings Cuddy's (and others') beliefs on issues of the day to bear in the story with crisp and believable dialogue.  Morally on par on multiple themes in the way that \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" read, \\"Time's Witness\\" is a classic of our times!<br />Bravo!	2003-04-09

True to form, Parker keeps the action localized to Florida -- this time by setting her crime/investigation in the Florida Keys.  I'm not sure why Anthony and Gail thought they'd be able to have a romantic getaway given what Anthony knew about his prospective client; the stepson of a wealthy hotel owner that Anthony has defended before.  This time, the client, Billy Fadden, has graduated from suspected arson to murder.  There isn't a lot of evidence against Billy, but he has confessed to the murder of a young lady he'd been romantically involved with.<br />Parker tries to keep the reader guessing with a variety of potential suspects, but too many of them have \\"over the top\\" personalities.  There's an aging film star (Sunset Boulevard) holed up in a decrepit mansion, a strange and moody handyman, the sister of the hotel owner - who fantasizes a love life with a local real estate lawyer (stalking him), etc., etc.  There's a storm in the keys, and the result is that we get a lot of descriptions of going back and forth from the hotel to the various places that Anthony & Gail are investigating the crime (I guess that's to get a sense of how difficult it can be to get around in the Keys).<br />We also get the ongoing debate about whether Gail and Anthony will marry -- this time they both fret endlessly about getting the marriage license.  As she did in her last book, Parker seems to be taking the tack of letting Gail's investigative talents outweigh Anthony's own, because of his tendency to jump to conclusions, and minimize small clues.  This is one more schism she is building in the relationship; not sure it is a good one.<br />All in all, getting through the book was kind of a labor of love; even the climax that unmasks the identity of the real killer was way over the top for me.  I enjoy the series and will continue with it, but this was definitely a setback in terms of how far afield Parker was willing to go to get a change of pace.  Anthony and Gail belong in courtrooms, or with legal puzzles that are more realistic to the types of law they practice.how far afield Parker was willing to go to get a change of pace.

Crais is a favorite of mine because he takes chances and seems to grow with his characters.  For four years, fans have been waiting for a new Elvis Cole book -- and this tense, fast paced story will not disappoint many!<br />Be prepared for the darker tone we saw in L.A. Requiem; there is little for Elvis to wisecrack about; no one has brought him a case to strategically solve, instead he's vilified as the party responsible for the kidnap of Ben Chenier.  Crais gives us strong dialogue and emotion, change ups in the story's point of view, some blind alleys and some down right insightful detective work.<br />Layers of Elvis' past evolve, and, for the first time, we see Joe Pike as vulnerable and unsure.  Crais adds Carol Starkey, tough cop from &quot;Demolition Angel&quot; as the Juvenile cop assigned to the case.  Starkey and Elvis are a potent mix.<br />True responsibility for the kidnapping is somewhat easy to guess, but Crais makes up for it by insuring that the story ends in a way that much of life does...everybody loses, but some lose more than most.<br />If there is a better writer in this genre today than Crais, please let me know who he/she is!  Crais' work is outstanding...<br />Highly recommended, but more so if you've read previous novels in the Cole series.  You can't invest as much in Elvis and Joe as characterized here, unless you've glimpsed the past.	2003-03-19

I'm incredibly impressed by [...]\\"The Dead Room\\" by Ellis, is almost as good.<br />Ellis takes some real events from various sources - sets them in a fictional setting, Philadelphia, and weaves fictional characters and subplots around them.  The protagonist, Teddy Mack, is perhaps a little too impressive for his relative lack of experience, but he dogs the true killer to save a client he believes in.  There's an interesting twist to Teddy's character, in that his father was imprisoned and put to death - that background weighs heavily on the choices Teddy makes.  Mentored and manipulated by William Nash, a leading attorney and professor of law in the area, Teddy demonstrates incredible problem solving skills in helping the police find the evidence to bring down a madman.  The serial killer is particularly macabre, and his pattern of identifying victims is chilling, as is the place where he brings them.<br />A dark tale that moves quickly, \\"The Dead Room\\" demonstrates that Robert Ellis can hold his own with the best of today's thriller writers.	2003-03-07

Dobson Howe, who makes a name for himself in leading the nation's voters to demand true equality through  a constitutional amendment, proposed on a grass-roots basis.<br /> Others follow his plan, and the 37th amendment is enacted to take away the guarantee of due process in the Bill of Rights, repealing the 14th amendment provisions that the states would also insure due process.  In the 40 years following the amendment, many states, California at the forefront, made harsh and expedited punishment the \\"law of their land\\" for violent crimes.<br /><br />The effect of this after 40 years, is that, without as many rights as they have today, violent criminals have pretty much ceased to exist.  California in 2056 is pretty idyllic in terms of the safety and security of its population.  California's expedited punishment law has been curtailed by the Federal Ramirez Act, so that violent criminals are guaranteed some time to appeal to guard against mistakes; a minimum of 5 years.  But California has challenged Ramirez as unconstitutional, and in the early pages of the novel, they win their appeal.  As a result, rapid execution is reinstated.<br />The novel's hero, Ted Braden, is caught unawares in the middle of a violent murder case, one of few that LA has seen in recent years.  Despite his assurance that the man accused of this murder couldn't have done it, because he was sitting near him at a Lakers' game when the murder occurred, the jury that convicts Robert Rand relies on the testimony of two eyewitnesses in a case of mistaken identity.  Rand's fate is pursued by Braden, working with the assistance of a contact in the DA's office,  Jordan Rainsborough, and C. Dobson Howe, aging, and determined to reverse the 37th amendment before he dies.<br /><br />The story moves quickly and absorbs you in the tale of justice gone wrong.  Shelley's writing is capable, Braden and Howe are believable - the romances of Braden are a touch unbelievable, particularly in the way he moves from woman to woman.  But, you'll find yourself engrossed in the story and receptive to the way in which Shelley pursues it,  particularly in light of her humor.  The book handles the sidebar of the all but 100% disappearance of marriage in the future, and the reasons why, with a light touch.  Although Jordan is somewhat of a caricature of the beauteous lawyer, her opening gambit, when many men ogle her, is amusing, \\"Sure, you think that.  But you won't call.\\"<br />In this day and age, when the composition of the Supreme Court, and those who control future appointments, will dictate whether Roe v. Wade survives, it is scary to realize that the Supreme Court does overrule itself on a political pendulum.  As this somewhat complex process continues, it may very well be that the American people have to resort to the Constitutional Amendment process to protect their rights.  In Shelley's dialogue:  \\"..a decision of the Supreme Court can be overturned by the decision of a future Supreme Court.  And that makes every vacancy on the Court a crisis for those who live by the grace of the last ruling.  A constitutional amendment, on the other hand, cannot be reversed simply because five of the nine justices think the time has arrived to reverse it.\\"  But this novel shows how that method can be a double-edged sword as well.<br />Complex and thoughtful, with a unique appendix that illustrates how an amendment came to protect something it was never intended to protect (the First Amendment and topless dancing), the 37th Amendment is a great introduction to a new writer's voice!Amendment and topless dancing), the 37th Amendment is a great introduction to a new writer's voice!	2003-03-02

Sandra's a writer's writer, and we've all heard the quote:<br /><br />&quot;You must stay drunk on writing so reality cannot destroy you.&quot;  ~Ray Bradbury<br /><br />Sandra gives us an admirable description of a year in her &quot;fictional&quot; life that completely illustrates the quote.  However, if you've never tried to be a writer (whether you succeeded or not)...you won't get it.<br /><br />  Sandra's a great essay writer and a standout on NPR, but in this piece, she gets stuck horizontally on living in L.A., and aging.  These semi-themes feed the underlying issue of the novel; how difficult the creative writing process can be; how obsessive are those who become a slave to it.  As a result, unless you're in the book to laugh at her witticisms about living in the Valley, or you need some &quot;women on aging&quot; jokes, you may just hate this book!<br /><br />While flying through a year in her life with hubby and near-perfect sister, while trying her hand at web writing and desperately trying not to finish a novel, Sandra dances off into flights of fancy which are illustrated in funny charts, graphs and pictures that help us visualize all of the soup floating around inside of her brain.  Some would view this as a leap of faith for an ADHD female, others just think it is a clear illustration that women whine.<br /><br />Hey, I'm an aging woman attempting to write, I love  visualization and illustration in a story, and I even get some of the cultural references to Van Nuys, although I'm on the other coast.  And I give it 4 stars.  Unless you can relate or participate in at least two of these endeavors, you may want to steer clear of &quot;A Year in Van Nuys&quot;...which you'll consider a waste of time.	2003-02-28

I'm not sure why and when I got interested in true crime and fiction about serial killers -- I'm guessing Patricia Cornwell had a lot to do with it.  I found myself browsing through Amazon, looking for books by the writer of a current paperback, \\"The Murder Channel\\" that I enjoyed and reviewed for Amazon.  When I pulled up Philpin's listing, I found this book.  I was immediately intrigued by the quality of the reviews and the fact that the book was completely unavailable at the time on any online site I visited.  Determined to make a \\"find\\", I finally located one at a local bookswap that was in terrific condition, and settled down to read.<br /><br /> Long story short, the other reviewers are absolutely on target with their praise of this collaboration between forensic psychologist John Philpin and private investigator Patricia Sierra.  Philpin must have a lot of experience getting inside the heads of brutal killers; he started with two true crime novels, added this, his first fiction book and its sequel (\\"Tunnel of Night\\") with Patricia Sierra, and has gone on to write several more.<br /><br /> Although the hero of the book is a woman cop, Detective Lane Frank, it feels as though the role of the profiler who is her father in the novel (Lucas Frank) must be very close to Philpin himself.  Having developed the art of telling his true crime novels in part from the point of view of the accused, Philpin embarks on a masterful telling of this tale, from five different points of view; victim, killer, pursuers.  This pattern, together with the cruelty of John Wolf and the masterful characterization and plot, resulted in a novel of true worth.<br /><br /> Not since my discovery, pre-publicity, of \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" and the additional unearthing of \\"Red Dragon\\", have I been so impressed with a work of the macabre. Parts of The Prettiest Feathers will shock you, much of it will scare you, and all of it will propel you to the end of the tale.<br /><br /> And then on to the sequel, \\"The Tunnel of Night\\" -- much as I'm going to do now!<br /><br /> ....<br /><br /> Keep the lights on!to the sequel, \\"The Tunnel of Night\\" -- much as I'm going to do now!  <br /><br /> ....<br /><br /> Keep the lights on!	2003-02-26

National news coverage of the doctors' campaign against tort reform is just beginning.  Grisham shows a side of the tort battle where attorneys wage war against pharmaceutical companies.  Since neither (attorneys or pharmaceutical companies) can escape public scorn, it feels a little like the bad guys fighting the bad guys.  So, it's a stretch to determine who you want to win!<br /><br /> Grisham has an anti-hero, Clay Carver, in the role of legal eagle this time.  We're supposed to believe that he's spent the better part of the last 4 years as a public defender, and in a relationship with a wealthy young woman whose parents  are social climbers.  You really can't get any passion out of his role in the Public Defender's office, nor out of his relationship.  All this changes when he is offered the money of a lifetime ($15 million) to quietly settle as yet unknown claims of those who have suffered due to a risky drug. The offer comes from Max Pace - a shady character who plays \\"fireman\\" for a drug company and has access to all sorts of information unknown to the public.  Shades of \\"The Firm\\"!<br /><br /> Given that Clay realizes very early on the problems associated with this much money, and sees a demonstration of how successful tort lawyers spend and spend and never achieve what they seek in life, you would think he would not fall into that trap.  But Grisham pushes him in with his eyes closed - even having him buy a Caribbean villa for his expensive mistress (with whom he has nothing in common) and a jet plane.<br /><br /> Clay's friends from the OPD that join him in the new work do what we expect HIM to do -- take the early money and run.  But he justs keeps his head in the sand and continues to burrow in,  deeper and deeper.<br /><br /> Thankfully, as in most Grisham novels, this does not go on for very long, as the book is brief, and the ending is predictable.<br /><br /> I gave the book three stars, which is a star generous, because it held my interest, despite lack of plot and characterization.  Grisham's ploy of using fiction to make a political statement about issues affecting the legal profession is always entertaining.<br /><br /> But if I were you, I'd wait for the paperback!lack of plot and characterization.

Published in oversized paperback for her first work, \\"The Crowning Circle\\", Lankford garnered a wealth of positive reviews for her interesting characters and dialogue and the \\"enjoyability\\" factor of her suspenseful plot.<br /><br />Who would think that her second novel would take such a turn?  Published on a national level this time, Lankford pulls the concept of cloning a human being from the headlines, combines it with well-researched medical data, adds her knowledge of New York and Italy, and wraps it up with the spiritual nature of her writing.  Wow!<br /><br />Lankford will also draw some critics who will scoff at the premise of the novel, or perhaps criticize the extent of her research into cloning - I rate the book based on its enjoyment factor, and strong sense of story.  In any case, it will be interesting to see what type of following the author draws with the her second work of fiction, a far cry from the first....<br /><br />\\"The Jesus Thief\\" takes a long hard look at how the world is really manipulated, how the masses yearn to believe, and characterizations and dialogue somewhat reminiscent of Dean Koontz.  The attempt to clone a spiritual descendant of Jesus goes forward inevitably, despite the fact that the characters have many second thoughts about their actions, which are shared by the readers.  Much more than a medical thriller, you will be drawn into the lives of Felix, Frances, Sam and Maggie, with the backdrop of family heritage and beliefs lost for a generation, then found again.<br /><br />Be sure to read \\"The Jesus Thief\\" and see what all the talk is about - a great book to cover in your book club!	2003-02-06

Stephen White brings us the 11th novel based on the cases of Colorado psychologist Alan Gregory, and the book continues to prove that White is one of the strongest and most consistent authors we have today.  White keeps the series alive by introducing FBI agent Kelda James and interspersing her past and present in third person while weaving Dr. Gregory into the novel with a first person voice.<br /><br />Featured once again is the majestic Colorado scenery around Boulder, along with some of its more eclectic citizens.  You want to believe in Kelda and you really feel her physical pain while the light of what constitutes her emotional pain surfaces through her therapy.  If there is a single criticism of the book, it is that Kelda chose her path of emotional pain and unwisely pursued the wrong end to it.<br /><br />Lauren & the other members of Gregorys family are bit-part players here, but we are treated to a lot more of Diane Estevez, Gregorys office partner, and Sam Purdy, the policeman who is Gregorys best friend.  Sams from Hibbing, Minnesota, one of my old stomping grounds, and White keeps the colorful Iron Range alive in his character.<br /><br /> Characterization, style changes, scenic passages, crisp dialogue and intricate plot are Whites hallmarks and he doesnt disappoint in the latest offering!<br /><br />Highly recommended!!! If youve not read Stephen White, by all means take the time to go back to Privileged Information where it all started.	2003-02-04

There are not very many books about athletes that can combine the reality of the sport with the emotion of the lives behind it.  Skating is kind of a fairy-tale sport, and Katia Gordeeva, in addition to her beauty, conveys a fairy-tale like quality both on the ice, and in her memoirs of her young skating career, and the life she entwined with her partner, lover, and husband Sergei Grinkov.  If you've seen Ekaterina skate, you can't help but see the glow and the emotion she conveys on the ice.<br />Off the ice, the book gives the reader a marvelous look into the rigors of the lives of Soviet athletes, and paints a picture of young Sergei that makes you understand why he was such a central force in Ekaterina's life.  The book is written a little clumsily, and although it does allow the reader to see and to understand all of Katia's insecurities, and worries about herself as a skater, a partner and a mother, the matter-of-fact style that it uses does Katia a disservice.<br />Still, and all, it is absorbing to read about this young lady who enjoyed such fame, such joy, and such a life changing tragedy as the death of her husband and professional partner.  Pictures contained in the book only whet your appetite even more for the story, and you are left with the satisfying feeling of love and loss.<br />A beautiful read!	2003-01-16

The longest case is the title case, which features the infamous wannabe plastic surgeon, Dr. Anthony Pignataro from Buffalo.  The cases against Pignataro had unfolded throughout the 90's....and I had left Buffalo by that time and only got bits and pieces of the saga.<br /><br /> I'm perhaps too taken with Ann Rule to judge this objectively; I do know that from time to time she waxes so strongly for the criminal's victim that perhaps she doesn't always portray the story in the fairest light.  In the case of Pignataro, we have perhaps one of the least evil criminals Rule has ever written about -- instead she presents a fascinating case study of how someone suffering from narcissism can actually allow it to draw them into cruel and criminal acts against others.  Those considering plastic surgery of any kind will learn to be sure and fully check credentials of the surgeon, before agreeing to the procedure.<br /><br />  The remaining cases, although shorter, each will hold your interest, and here you will meet some truly sociopathic personalities.  Once again, you'll be caught up in how much Rule learns and researches her true crime pieces, and how scary the world can be.  In this case, Rule not only features victims<br />who are close relatives or acquaintances of sociopaths, but also strangers who come into the periphery of a sociopathic personality, and how they can be victimized by such a criminal.<br /><br />  Highly readable and another winner from Ann Rule!	2003-01-13

I think the research added a lot to the murder plot of Q.<br />However, I can't help but compare the most recent Kinsey outing with that of another fine author, Marcia Muller.  Muller published \\"Dead Midnight\\", the 21st instalment of the Sharon McCone series, just before Q came out, and it is a terrific read.  Like Kinsey, Sharon has many family problems, but her character has grown, changed and prospered over the years, and is surrounded by both familiar and new characters who keep the texture of the series updated.<br />Kinsey seems stuck in a rut, going nowhere.  The supporting characters are all of another generation, and Kinsey no longer seems to relate at all to her contemporaries.  Yes, she's always been somewhat of a loner, but the direction that she's taken to isolate herself even further with only familiar senior citizens seems unnatural and false.  I think Grafton has spent enough time on the murder plot of \\"Q\\" to make it realistic, but has paid not enough attention to Kinsey's character development.<br /><br /> I hope that she gets back on track with \\"R\\".  She's still on bestseller lists, but is losing some of her following with the downhill direction that the series is taking.	2003-01-03

All Michael Crichton has to do is produce a new book every 3 years or so to start the great debates.  Does he preach too much?  Does he really entertain?  Is he a novelist, or just getting rich from publishing because he knows he doesn't have to write, just package the same thrills over and over, and the public will buy?<br /><br />You either enjoy the ride with Crichton, or you hate it.  I personally was overwhelmed and much in favor of \\"Timeline\\", but<br />I know many people thought it atrocious.  With Crichton, I'm really on board for the ride, just to see what he has up his sleeve this time....in Prey, he's done his job - given the reader a different slant on his entertaining premise, that corporate villains will subvert science and technology for their own gains, oblivious to the effect on the human race.  His story holds your interest until the end, and he's done at least some homework in the field of nanotechnology...and only 1 out of 100 readers will be able to catch the flaws.<br /><br />Like as not, when you are reading thrillers, most readers don't expect sound characterization and dialogue, and Crichton tries hard in this arena, and does an adequate job.  But his hero is worth rooting for, and his plot sufficiently engrossing enough to make you stay awake reading far into the night.<br /><br /> I buy and read Crichton for what his books are, and not for what they are not.  I thought \\"Prey\\" was an able attempt to make the public aware of the perils of nanotechnology, while entertaining us all.  I fall short of wanting to see this made into a movie, after the horrendous treatment of \\"Congo\\", but I guess you can't have everything.  And I'm sure that Crichton's next book will be about corporate baddies who risk human lives by perverting science in a nonethical way...and I'll probably buy and enjoy that as well!<br /><br /> Formulaic?  Yes...Entertaining?  Most certainly!  Enjoy!	2002-12-30

Jeffrey Deaver has the uncanny ability to step in and out of the skin of Lincoln Rhyme, the hero of his major series of work.  Unlike many authors, who stop a series to branch out into new fields, or others who continue only in the same vein, Deaver takes breaks from the rhythm of Rhyme, sidebars into completely different and compelling plots, and still comes home to entertain with Rhyme again!<br />\\"A Maiden's Grave\\" may just be my favorite Deaver novel.  From the title pun to the complete curveball that is thrown at the end of the story, Deaver never stops compelling you to turn the pages.<br />Set in a gruesome slaughterhouse, where escaped prisoners have taken their helpless girl hostages (many of whom are deaf) AMG lets you get inside the minds of some of the hostages, of the captors, and of Arthur Potter, the FBI's main hostage negotiator.  All of the characters are flawed, in rich and sometimes curious ways.  While stretching the tale, Deaver transports you to the scene as you can visualize what it would be like to be one of the hostages.  Friends tell me that Deaver has done phenomenal research into the world of the deaf, in order to be able to describe what life is like for them, and how the camaraderie of groups of hearing-impaired people can sometimes be a burden, when one decides to become more involved with those who hear.  Odd intricacies of plot background are a hallmark of Deaver's stories....but this one is hard to put down.<br />Enjoy!	2002-12-06

Without giving the plot away, those close to Dallas are in danger, and are injured, compelling her to work at an exhausting pace to resolve the mystery and put \\"criminals in high places\\" behind bars.<br />Dallas is true to form both in action, and in squirming over the politics of being on the police force and being married to Roarke.  All the colorful supporting characters are back, although there is rather less of the butler, Summerset, than I would prefer.  His love-hate relationship with Dallas is always colorful.<br />Something about this installment dragged for me, although I couldn't put my finger on it, and I kept putting the book down and picking it up again...as a result, it took me longer to read than usual.

A great way to start enjoying the works of unheralded author Michael Malone is to read his North Carolina murder mystery, Uncivil Seasons.  Malone's anti-hero is Justin Savile, born to a genteel southern family, as his name indicates.  The plot is complex, and revolves around Joanna Cadmean, a local psychic, helping Justin to investigate the murder of a member of a prominent family.  Both scenic passages and characterizations are compelling, and true to the south.  The mystery remains a mystery, and you find yourself pulling for Justin and partner Cuddy Mangum.<br />There's a romance here, too, and it's played with just the right lightness of touch.

William Connelly, he of the anti-heroes Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb, takes another trip into stand-alone novel territory.  Like &quot;Void Moon&quot;, his past non-series effort, &quot;Chasing the Dime&quot; is worth the read and you'll recognize a lot of the writing talent that make Connelly's series so popular.<br />A little thin of plot, Chasing the Dime features another troubled hero, Henry Pierce - but this time Connelly showcases the dot com world of stress and success.  Detailed descriptions of Pierce's inventions are excellent, and the concept that such a technology might exist one day is exciting.  So, too, is the stress and high stakes poker in finding venture capital, which Connelly showcases in a realistic way.  But these are secondary to the plot -- Henry's obsession and inability to forget someone he never knew, but who reminds him of his murdered sister.<br />His new phone number is tied to the website of an exotic escort named Lilly.  A little cursory research piques Henry's curiosity about Lilly and he begins to seek out what has happened to her.  A twisted path of lies, deceit and danger follows, with Henry being drawn into a trap.  Keen insight and an analytical mind keep him on the trail, without the police instincts of Connelly's other heroes.<br />Connelly does more than just dash off a novel for a change of pace -- he's purchased websites mentioned in the book and made them companion pieces to his novel -- and he left his &quot;Hieonymous Bosch&quot; signature when he mentions the famous painter in passing, and also links the story to the tale of &quot;The Dollmaker&quot;....the villain in &quot;Concrete Blonde&quot;.<br />Connelly is heads and shoulders above most of today's thriller writers, and although this is not as good as his last two novels, it will keep you turning the pages long past the time you meant to keep reading.<br />Enjoy!	2002-11-05

Kate Reddy is talented.  She's ambitious, beautiful and sensitive.  She knows what she wants.  She knows she doesn't want the kind of life (international travel, stressful career, two small children and no time for self, friends or husband) she has.  She just doesn't know how to make it stop.<br />Allison Pearson displays a vast knowledge of her subject matter, a quick wit, a delightful ability to turn a phrase (more lines from this book are being quoted in email than any other this year!) and the wisdom to mix the emotional pain of Kate's situation with the droll jokes that keep most of us going.<br />Pearson discloses the secret, that working moms everywhere are aware of...that GUILT is our largest emotion.  That in trying to do it all and be it all that we feel we give short shrift to our families, because our skills are much more finely honed at our work.  But, our workplace doesn't appreciate above and beyond, and our families tell us in many ways that we are not succeeding very well in being the \\"glue that holds...\\"  ...you know.  By the way, she also shares the fact that we bribe, lie and compete with stay at home moms to be \\"good enough\\" and that all of us suffer memory loss on a daily basis.<br />Pearson writes in partial sentences that will drive grammar teachers wild, but it is the type of language that the sleep deprived know best.  Her \\"to do lists\\" at the end of many chapters are in some ways the funniest part of the book.  But her aching emotion for her family and children, and her recognition of how important, how critical, a parent is, (and how little we recognize how few of us are well-suited to it)give the book its emotional texture.<br />Pearson may not have invented irony, but I daresay, no one has used it in quite the brilliant way she does here in the modern novel.  Now, this book will play well most likely with her peers, and not others, but that's a broad enough base to make this a sleeper hit of 2002.<br />My favorite line that's been in my emails?

Butch has remained sort of a \\"devoted rock\\", while Marlene has flirted with guns, drink, toyed with the idea of an affair, etc.<br />In \\"Absolute Rage\\", Marlene has settled into a different type of lifestyle, on Long Island, training guard dogs in the manner of her own devoted Neapolitan mastiff.  Daughter<br />Lucy, now at Boston College, is back, and really shines in this novel; much of which is told from her point of view.  The Karps become entangled with another family at the beach, West Virginians, the Heeneys.  Violence directed at the Heeney family soon touches the Karps, and no one is safe.  While Butch tries to stop the violence through legal channels, wife Marlene unleashes the fury of a woman whose family is threatened.<br />Still entertaining, with sharp characterization and  a feeling that Karp will soon be deserting the DA's office for something different, Tanenbaum gives us another tale of family woven with violence that will keep your heart pounding until the end.  Still, one hopes that in novel 15, Tanenbaum will give Marlene's wild side a little rest......<br />Excellent!!	2002-10-29

Judge Deborah Knott's complicated and extensive family structure gets even more complex in this, her 9th outing for Maron's compelling tales in North Carolina.  Suddenly, new and formerly unknown family members are popping out of the woodwork when the carnival comes to Dobbs, and with the new kin comes one bloody death and fear of more.<br />Maron has put together an entertaining tale, full of character, that sends Judge Knott back to remember her childhood, and introduces Tally Ames, a complex woman proud to be \\"a carnie\\".<br />There's a relationship surprise in the book, as Maron introduces a romance of sorts between Deb'rah and long-time friend Dwight Bryant, one that Maron fans have been expecting and hoping for for a long time.  So, while weaving a delicious mystery, the author once again succeeds in giving us a sweet tale, full of the comfort of the south, and kin, and small town loves and friendships.	2002-10-29

Chazin's career has given her an amazing depth of vision about firefighting and the crime of arson.  Dialogue between firefighting personnel is natural and logical.<br />Heroine Georgia Skeehan investigates \\"flashover\\", an incendiary and simultaneous combustion of room and contents that occurs when conditions are right.  Her partner, Carter, is letting her take the lead in the investigation, subtly changing their longstanding relationship.  Her romance with Mac Marenko feels unsettled; she's serious, he hasn't even invited her to meet his family.  Then again, is he involved in a coverup of these crimes? What did he have to do with the death of her best friend?<br />Chazin alternates short, biting chapters, with longer descriptive chapters, and carefully builds the plot throughout the book.  When Skeehan finally triumphs, she uses her success to force a departmental issue, winning a settlement for families of firefighters who had previously given their lives for the department.<br />Chazin's a double threat in the action and romance arena, and her heroine is vulnerable, uncertain, but talented and dedicated to the work she does.<br />Looking forward to more novels in the Skeehan series!	2002-10-29

It's their destination because they are meeting past starlet Clea, former wife of their brother, at her farm in Temptation.  Sophie Dempsey, more closely tied to earth than sister Amy, wants to insure that the documentary does not resemble an X-rated picture, but she's losing the battle.<br /> She's thrown together with the town's favorite son and mayor, Phin Tucker, and his irrepresible daughter Dillie (and his arrogant mother!).  Phin and his friend the sheriff keep close watch on the Dempseys while trying to solve the unlikely murder of Clea's husband Zane.  Crusie's trademark romps in the bedroom (on the dock, in and on cars, etc.) bind Phin and<br />Sophie together, and her sarcastic wit and loony dialogue add to the fun.<br />A great read!	2002-10-19

Instead, I liked the book enormously, but didn't necessarily enjoy it.<br />Alice Sebold has done an amazing job with a first novel; you can tell she's been writing a long time, and it will be interesting to see her other works.  Her style is very visual, and her words flow like poetry, until she wants you to sit up and take notice; and then she will write something so arresting, that you're not sure how you got around that corner.  Heroine Susie Salmon has very few years on earth, and so even the small things about her life are featured in Sebold's beautiful prose:<br />&quot;I loved the way the burned-out flshcubes of the Kodak Instamatic marked a moment that had passed,.....When they were spent, I took the cubed four-corner flashbulbs and passed them from hand to hand until they cooled.  ...I had rescued the moment by using my camera and in that way had found a way to stop time and hold it.  No one could take that image away from me because I owned it.&quot;<br />Sebold took a visionary point of view, that of the dead girl, and utilized it to tell the story of a family in shambles following a single, telling act of violence.  For me, it helped to explain why this seems to happen to families when violence shatters their worlds.  In Mr. Harvey, Sebold's villain, a character so dark and fearful exists, that surely he must be played on film by the masterful Anthony Hopkins.  There is a central passage in the novel, after the violence and the tone is set, and before a surprising twist near the end, where the novel breaks down, moves slowly, covers the same ground over and over.  During this time, Susie is so passive and sad, that it makes it difficult to read on.<br />But read on, I did, and was glad that I had.  The Lovely Bones is a work to be experienced, not just read, and it deserves a wide following.  I'm sure it will invoke a lot of passion, both pro and con, for the story, and, isn't that what great writing is all about.<br />The Lovely Bones - a 2002 bestseller, and richly deserved.ll about.<br />The Lovely Bones - a 2002 bestseller, and richly deserved.	2002-10-04

Perri O'Shaughnessy, the entertaining sister team of writers, serve up an especially interesting plot for their Lake Tahoe lawyer-heroine, Nina Reilly.  Nina's confronted with a situation that could ruin her for life, and three client cases are commingled with her own downfall, when the client files are stolen.<br />Nina's love life with her investigator is more settled in this outing, although briefly challenged by her ex-husband.  Her three clients are diverse, and the reaction and chain events set off by the loss of the files follow widely divergent paths, as well.  It's obvious that Nina is someone's target, but who is her enemy?<br />4 stars due to the complex and interesting plot, and the unique ending, which leaves the reader guessing what direction the series will take in the future.  Not nearly as good in characterization or plot fulfillment as previous Nina Reilly episodes, but the O'Shaughnessy novels are heads and shoulders above most courtroom fiction, and I eagerly await the next one!	2002-09-29

If you missed the beautiful film, \\"Anne of the Thousand Days\\", its probably because you were born after 1969, the year of the film, and watch videos on DVD (the film has only been released on VHS).  The film, a historical piece, is a treasure, illustrating with some historical inaccuracy the schism between the Catholic church and the throne of England, which fathered the Reformation and the rise of the Church of England.  To think that it was all caused by a fiery young girl that the King (Henry VIII) simply had to have, in the belief that she would bear him a son.<br /><br />Richard Burton shines in the role of Henry VIII, and makes you believe that the women in his life all married him for reasons other than queenship.  He creates unbelievable chemistry with the then unknown young actress, Genevieve Bujold, who went on to some success in Hollywood in the next decade.  She is bewitching as Anne, and gives one of the finest speeches on film ever made by a woman, when she vents her anger and fear at Henry in the tower before her death, and pledges that her daughter will become a great leader one day (Elizabeth I); a vision that came true.<br /><br />Phillipa Gregory may have been inspired by that film, because her Anne (in a secondary role in this story of Mary Boleyn)is just as conniving, feisty and beautiful as was Bujold's.  She captivates all of the court, but her need for power (encouraged by the grasping Boleyn & Howard families) and lust for vengeance at a lost love turn her from the center of the kingdom to one of its most despised residents.<br /><br />Gregory's genius in writing her tale is point of view - that of Mary Boleyn, who was spurned by the king after giving birth to two of his children out of wedlock.  Mary is a complicated woman who learns what Anne cannot; that happiness is more important than position in life.  Gregory completely holds the reader's interest through good times for the Boleyns and bad, and populates the tale with strong characterization of supporting players, particularly Katherine of Aragon, Henry's first queen.<br />George Boleyn, Uncle Howard, Wolsley the Cardinal, Jane Seymour,<br />William Carey and Mary's children are all convincingly drawn, and Gregory makes it hard to know where fact ends and fiction begins, so compelling is her rationalization of the events that played out on the world's stage.<br /><br />The character of Jane Parker, George's wife, is perhaps the only false or shallow note -- too vapid to be believed.<br /><br />What a wonderful tale and a wonderful author!  It will hold your interest, despite its length, and you'll remember it as every bit as well written as the historical fiction given us by Jean Plaidy some years earlier.<br />Bravo!characterization of supporting players, particularly Katherine of Aragon, Henry's first queen. <BR>George Boleyn, Uncle Howard, Wolsley the Cardinal, Jane Seymour, <BR>William Carey and Mary's children are all convincingly drawn, and Gregory makes it hard to know where fact ends and fiction begins, so compelling is her rationalization of the events that played out on the world's stage.<BR><BR><BR>The character of Jane Parker, George's wife, is perhaps the only false or shallow note -- too vapid to be believed.  <BR><BR><BR>What a wonderful tale and a wonderful author!

It rates five starts for its incredible pacing and the twists and turns it takes through the Alaska landscape.<br />Micky is a cop who has had a lot of tragedy and death in her life.  She escapes Houston to the other side of the world, to visit her friend Damon in Alaska.  Fade out and it's 4 years later and Micky is still there, losing herself in the art of stained glass.  Everyone knows everyone in the small outpost of McRay, so when the killings start, it seems surreal.  There's no serial killer here, just a madman on a spree.<br />Young Dawn Glorianus is the first witness to the murders being committed by Eldred, who has always been somewhat of a cipher to the other folks in McRay.  The story, with an intense pace and deadly violence moves on from where Dawn's mother is killed.  Micky is forced to deal with her fears of death and violence in order to save lives, but nothing prepares her for the twist of fate she finds when she learns why El is killing.<br />Cold Heart, McGrew's first novel, came out only in paperback (remember Grisham?), but it is such a tense and exciting read, it should create a following for the next paperback, Night Terror.  McGrew, if he can continue in this vein, promises to be one of the exciting young authors of the future.  Unlike many new authors, he doesn't sacrifice characterization for action -- and Micky, Dawn and Damon are thoroughly sketched, with interesting supporting characters sprinkled throughout the chapters.<br />A real gem of a book, really could not put it down once I got started!<br />And a real plus was the author's dedication, which was memorable:<br />  \\"Oh, hell, they're all for Rene\\".	2002-09-24

It's action-packed, with interesting characterization, and compels the reader to finish the tale as fast as possible.  Grippando keeps the plot twists somewhat bizarre, so its difficult to know which way the story is going next....all of which adds up to a very satisfying read!	2002-09-23

Russo's observer here is the child of divorce, and it's not for the faint of heart, those that have had or are contemplating a divorce where there are children involved.  The story seems to help us realize that the impact we all fear on the children involved is real, and goes beyond the ability to cope that we all hope they have.<br /><br /> \\"The Whore's Child\\" doesn't fit the collection really well, and it feels as though Russo sold out on the packaging, to get a tale in the lead whose title would draw readers who might not otherwise buy.  As its own tale, however, the Whore's Child stands up to the standard set by Russo in his other work.<br /><br /> Nice change of pace for Russo fans!	2002-09-14

These were no flukes!  Cray seems to be as comfortable when his main character is a female, and a cop, as he was with Sid Kaplan.<br />He manages to capture all the difficulty a woman on the force has with the balance of job and family, authority and friendship, in his heroine, Julia Brennan.<br />Andrew Vachss has successfully dealt for years with the seamy side of crime - child prostitution and pornography.  Cray tackles these crimes with the discovery of a dead child...whose memory resonates in Brennan's head.  She pushes on with partner Foley, uncovering a band of deviants who are among New York City's most wealthy.  Cray keeps a little more distance than Vachss, dealing with the crimes with compassion, but blending the stark reality with characters who, on the surface, seem normal, although they are sexual predators.<br />There are some excellent supporting players in Julia's team, along with Foley, (a difficult man to read), the profiler, Julia's uncle,( a journalist), and her daughter.  Chief among the players is Anja Dascalescu; the \\"Little Girl Blue\\" of the title.  Although we never meet Anja in life, in death, she represents the thousands of children who are forced to live as victims by predators who think only of themselves.<br />Little Girl Blue is a powerful novel, with an exciting climax, and characters you would like to meet again.

Crusie is a new favorite of mine, and her newest, \\"Faking It\\", contains the combination of mystery, zaniness, crazy characters, love & sex that have made her such a great read in the past.<br />This time the heroine is Tilda, an artist, who is the caretaker of her family.  The three generations of women in the family (mom Gwen, neice Nadine, both entertaining!) give us a woven thread of a sensible ensemble...but Crusie throws in a lot of characters and characterizations that don't add to the story.  Tilda's sister Eve/Louise is confused about which of her two personalities to follow; her romance is incidental to the book & Eve/Louise doesn't work as well as \\"the best friend\\" character that Crusie usually adds to the mix.<br />The romance for the heroine occurs early in the book with Davy - a thief who is trying to secure the return of property from a former flame, Clea, now with a wealthy art collector.  Art is the theme that binds them all together, specifically forged art.<br />The book's clever, but the jumble of characters and the surface romance between Tilda and Davy (Crusie can usually give you a twosome to root for) with Clea as the necessary third in the triangle just don't compare to Crusie's former lighthearted works.<br />Worth a read, especially if you're still beach bound, but Crusie can do better!	2002-09-04

The brittle, cold heroine of Paul Eddy's first fiction thriller is worth more than a glance.  It is hard to know what makes Flint tick, even though the book explores her life from the viewpoint of an outsider, in<br />retrospect.  Flint's a British operative, gone awol after she is caught in the crossfire of an international plot.<br />Harry Cohen, trying to find her, gives us the retrospective.  Unlike Flint, Harry's almost too real, too wounded, to be given the task.  His character, the best developed in the book, sees every issue from both sides; he's devoted to finding Flint, helping her, and righting the wrong that's been done her.<br />Meanwhile, Flint uses her powers of deception and persuasion to seek her revenge on an international criminal.  The reader is absorbed in her risk-taking, all the while learning what makes her tick.  Think Marg Helgenberger for the film or the TV movie.<br />Not a big fan of spy thrillers, I found Flint engaging, well-written, with a few forgiveable flaws.  Looking forward to more from Paul Eddy, he has a new and crisp voice.	2002-08-28

Lee Child gets back on track with his hero, Jack Reacher.<br />After being disappointed in Running Blind and Echo Burning, I'd hoped that Child would return to the form of his first three Reacher novels, and he did!<br />Although it seems as though there are some readers that didn't appreciate the story, I found it to be exciting, fast-paced, and novel.  Reacher is acting as a consultant to the Secret Service, drawn in by his dead brother's former paramour, M.E. Froelich.<br />There's good interaction and character development between Reacher &amp; M.E., (not much in the way of other characters, though) and the plot builds to an exciting climax.

While I applaud Kellerman for bringing him back -- a complex character, with a love/hate relationship with Peter Decker; I wish she hadn't chosen New York as the setting.<br />Kellerman has moved Decker to the Big Apple to help family before; but this one's a stretch.  He's there to help his half-brother Jonathan's family find Jon's neice -- a girl by the name of Shayndie Lieber (whose brief appearance does nothing to make her character believable!)  Decker's dealing with ultra-Orthodox Jews, and, unfortunately, there is little positive about the sect he tries to help, and far too much detail in this plot.  Although it is the primary plot, it grows boring, and the reader turns to the evolving clash between Decker and Donatti, who is surprisingly involved on the fringes of Shayndie's disappearance.<br />Over the top, as well, are the tales of Rina and her endless quest for shopping in the Big Apple - and the contrived plot of his staying in New York, well past the time he should have gone south with her.  Weaving in a relationship between Rina and Donatti didn't help the novel, it hurt.<br />I still love this series, and love to explore what I can learn about the Jewish faith from Kellerman's characters.  But Peter's a homicide Lieutenant in southern California....and there should be many, many untold stories to be resolved there, surrounded by the interesting people in his squad.<br />Things that saved 3 stars, other than Donatti were the amount of time Kellerman spent fleshing out the character of Randy, Decker's real brother...and I couldn't help but enjoy the twist at the end of the novel on another former Kellerman villain...Steven Gilbert.  Enough said!<br />Wait for the paperback, or go to the library for this one!	2002-08-26

You can tell how much she's learned about acting and singing from the way she's directed her career, (not to mention the success she's had on the large and small screen, in concert, and on stage!) that she was not going to be the fabulous face that went from the runway to a brief acting career based solely on her looks.  Yes, in telling of her family and the men in her life, she's remarkably honest and open.<br />Cybill has a little more trouble accepting responsibility for the untimely death of her two great sitcoms....\\"Moonlighting\\" with Bruce Willis, and \\"Cybill\\" with Christine Baranski.  She played a singularly important role in bringing both of them to television, and in heightening their success, but ultimately was too dictatorial about content and her role, and unhappy about the success of her costars to allow the shows to continue peacefully.

Now Anne, who we meet briefly, has been murdered. Many aspects of the murder give Kali doubts about whether it is a copycat crime, and leave her struggling with the thought that she, Anne, and Owen Nelson (now running for governor, but currently the DA) may have convicted an innocent man.  The identity of Anne's murderer, who seemingly continues to kill,  becomes more obscure as the novel progresses, with a sad and unexpected twist in the conclusion.<br /><br />Without any time in the courtroom, Jacobs focuses her skills on the characters who try to put together the evidence, Kali, the two detectives on the case, Lou and Bryce (think George Dzundza and Chris Noth, the original detectives on Law & Order), Dr. Dunworthy, the original profiler, and Nash, who is fighting for his career, and ultimately his life.  Jacobs gives us excellent character sketches of all, and allows the story to be told from various points of view.  There are excellent supporting characters in Nash's family, Selby and Alex, in Gloria, Kali's secretary, and in slimeballs Al Gomez, a publicity starved attorney, and Nathan Sloane, a strange stalker that Kali mistakenly becomes involved with.<br />There's some comic relief and a pretty on-target girlfriend relationship between Kali and Margot, a male neighbor in the process of becoming a woman...who's quite over-the-top...even to the extent of having 4 wolfhounds.<br /><br />All in all, Jacobs writes strong characters, with a believable, intricate and interesting plot, enough romance to keep the reader guessing, and a heroine sometimes torn by uncertainty in her career and in her personal life.<br /><br />Jacobs has style and I'm going to hurry and read some of her earlier material, and hope that it's as enjoyable as \\"Cold Justice\\".and I'm going to hurry and read some of her earlier material, and hope that it's as enjoyable as \\"Cold Justice\\".	2002-08-12

Rosenfeldt worked in marketing for Tri-Star pictures before trying his hand at screenplays, and this, his first novel.  He has a smooth, confident style and a hero steeped in courtroom shenanigans.  Like Coben's hero, Myron Bolitar, Andy Carpenter is a sports nut and a smartass, but a loveable one.  Like Koontz's heroes, Andy is hung up on his Golden Retriever, Tara, and much of the charm and humor of the character comes out in his frequent references to her.<br />Carpenter's first story (I say first, because the book cries out for a sequel or two or thirteen) involves an appeal in a case of capital murder.  His case is tangled in his past with his beloved father, and his feeling that there is more than meets the eye to his dad's request for him to defend a man that he, himself, had convicted.  Tangled with the defense of his client, Willie Miller, is Andy's own broken marriage and his attempt at reconciliation after he's already fallen in love with someone new.<br />The plot to prove Willie's innocence is less than original, and a little shallow, but the witty repartee and diarization style of writing adopted by Rosenfeldt is charming and breezy.  Many small humorous passages will make you laugh, even though the scene is serious.  Carpenter's explanation to Miller of why he will probably still lose the trial...\\"suppose Dinky University's football team goes down to Florida State and loses ....but the game doesn't count because FSU's water boy wasn't eligible....Dinky is still Dinky\\".  Carpenter's rants against DNA, his soliloquy to the Yankees and his betting contests with his father, courtroom antics such as the stunt with Kevin's cousin -- all are irreverent and totally New Jersey in their origin and humor.<br />It's not a great novel, but it ranks as a great and entertaining first effort, and Rosenfeldt will have a terrific career if there are more like this to come!<br />Read it, enjoy,laugh!	2002-07-22

Allen, Jr. is a correspondent for The National Catholic Reporter.  He has penned a biography of controversial Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger of the Vatican, and has already contracted to cover the future election of the new Pope for Fox News.  Many Americans cannot remember the media focus and the world attention that the death of a popular Pope and the election of a new Cardinal to fill \\"the shoes of the fisherman\\" draw, since the event has not happened since 1978.  Allen gives us a stunning view of the likely scenarios, issues and the potential for transformation that the Catholic Church faces as John Paul II's days as the most powerful leader in the Christian world draw to a close.<br />From Allen, we get the history of the papacy and the relevance of the way today's church works.  He presents issues of bioethics, the church's positions on celibacy and sexuality, the need for church collegiality throughout the world, the need to balance centrist Vatican powers with the role of the world's bishops, and many current Catholic doctrines that will be continued or changed, depending on the election of the new Pope.  He presents a dignified and on the mark representation of John XXIII, Paul VI, and John Paul I and II.  He is both informative and relevant on the ceremonies that will transpire when the current Pope dies, without leaving any sense of a \\"lameduck\\" status for the existing Papacy and Vatican staff.<br />It's noteworthy that Allen tries to stay neutral on the current stand of the church on the issues, and on his introduction of the conclave participants - the world's cardinals.  There is a little liberal and reform bias here, but he is careful to point it out. His choice of 20 of the most prominent or likely candidates is well thought out, and although he is clear that there are many prominent European candidates, the reader learns why the next Pope will not be elected from the USA, and clearly outlines why the 6 Latin American and 2 African Cardinals are serious contenders to lead the Catholic church in the new millennium.<br />A fascinating frontspiece to one of the world's great dramas, \\"The Conclave\\" makes for interesting reading for Catholics and non-Catholics alike.als are serious contenders to lead the Catholic church in the new millennium.<br />A fascinating frontspiece to one of the world's great dramas, \\"The Conclave\\" makes for interesting reading for Catholics and non-Catholics alike.	2002-07-22

Sturgis.  Frog Point, the town of their youth, seems innocent on the surface, but there are a lot of secrets that have not been turned up yet by the town gossips.<br />Maggie, who's finding out too late that nobody in Frog Point likes her husband Brent, decides to let him run off to South America as he's planned, before she launches her divorce.  She's trying to hold off her feelings for C.L., and wishes she had when Brent turns up dead, and both of them now have a motive for murder.  Caught in the middle are Emily, the Faraday's young daughter, who loves both parents but instinctively knows there will be trouble in the family and Treva, Maddie's best friend, whose secret is so old and so buried, she can't possibly tell Maddie the truth.  Right up till the end, it isn't apparent<br />Cruisie manages to mix humor with her taste for outrageous sex and chocolate, and with the mystery of Brent's untimely demise.  Maddie's a true heroine in the Crusie tradition, mixed up, mad, confused and much loved by the people whose lives she touches.<br />Droll, sentimental,  appealing, sexy and told for laughs, \\"Tell Me Lies\\" is a great beach book, and a winner for the consistent Crusie!	2002-07-22

I picked this one up in the airport in paperback, and was immediately engrossed in the story of a dysfunctional African-American family -- as told from the point of view of each of its six members.<br />McMillan truly captures the difficulty of sustaining a long marriage, sketches each of the adult children by using their own and their siblings and parents' points of views.  Each character is richly textured; and although you have more difficulty rooting for Lewis and Charlotte to find happiness, you ultimately<br />become deeply supportive of every character.  The book builds to a truly definitive high point when mother Viola's letters to her long-time husband and each of her four children are revealed and read aloud.<br />McMillan gives us a deeply moving, complicated story of love, joy and heartache in families - and describes the feel of living in Las Vegas with uncanny ability.<br />With this book, McMillan establishes herself, not as just a popular novelist, but perhaps as the voice of a generation of young African-Americans.	2002-07-10

It is after you've finished, and think about your reactions, that you'll wish Running Blind was as good an outing as the first 3 Reacher novels.<br />There's a killer loose in this novel, and the victims are three women, all of whom have a tie in the past to Jack Reacher, while in the military.  Naturally, with crime scenes that are incredibly far-fetched, the FBI is sniffing around for a serial killer...and Jack is a prime suspect.  Once he is off the hook, the FBI decides to use him to help find the killer.  It's a plausible theme, with an interesting M.O., but Child loses his way in the story.<br />To begin... Jack needs to be on the road, not settled down with Jodie; Child does find a creative way to take care of that.  But, despite the excitement of the tale, the story is unsatisfying, much of the characterization missing or lacking, and there are the usual editing errors you find in each Child work.<br />I'm hanging in there with the series, because Reacher is one of the more interesting (if over the top) leading characters developed in serial thrillers in the last few years, but Running Blind could have, should have, been a much better story.	2002-07-07

He's in hot, dry, west Texas (and Child really makes you feel as though you are there - you're thirsty throughout the story!) where he's enlisted himself to help an abused (?) wife, Carmen Greer, and her daughter, Ellie.  Greer's tale is fraught with lies, and, if I were Jack, I would have given up on her.  She's not able to escape her husband, Sloop, and his secretive pack of friends that<br />have a past that leads to bloodshed.<br />The pace bogs down from time to time, and it is difficult to root for Carmen.  The ending is a lot more transparent than anything Child has given us previously.  Worst of all, Child gets bogged down in his own descriptiveness, a problem encountered in his earlier works, where it was more forgiveable and did less to hurt his characterization and his pace.<br />Not giving up on Jack, because he is the most refreshing hero of the past few years, but one more average work by Lee Child will send me scurrying for some new authors!	2002-07-07

India Edghill doesn't exactly strike out on her own, if you've read Diamante's &quot;The Red Tent&quot;, but Edghill lays claim to an ability to weave a fascinating story around Biblical characters.<br />She adds terrific insight into the woman's role in Biblical times with all her women's characters, and gives us a heroine to believe in, King David's first wife, Queen Michal, daughter of King Saul.  The comparison's of Saul's court experiences to the grandeur that was the chosen land in the time of David strike incredible contrasts.<br />It is easy to fall into the book in reading the first third, because David meets every expectation, and his relationships with Saul, his daughter, and his son Jonathan, are complex and somewhat ironic.  Edghill goes too far in her characterization of David's &quot;ruler mentality&quot; and cunning in the mid and latter years of David's life.  It is easy to see how someone from such humble beginnings could lose his humility when told for his lifetime that he is God's chosen.  However, David's ruthlessness<br />and inability to love anyone that is not made over in his image<br />are too stark to be fully believable.  Better of Edghill to have given us a David with moments throughout his life of wisdom, showing why Yahweh &amp; Samuel anointed him.<br />Still, the jarring notes of court life,and the descriptions of people and places in Biblical times are approached with the skill of a great writer.<br />I'm anxious to see more of Edghill, and glad to have made Michal's acquaintance through her eyes.	2002-07-06

Sid shares an odd existence with friends and co-workers Caleb and Julia - but his luck takes a turn for the better (worse?) when he's offered a shot at a murder trial that makes headlines.  Sid's not sure of why his client, Priscilla Sweet, an abused wife with a checkered past, and her mother, have chosen him, but he is all too ready to climb the ladder again.<br />Strong dialogue, and the lack of trust and honesty between lawyer and client keep the plot moving so quickly, you don't want to put the book down.  Cray essentially puts motivation in all his characters, and, in Sid, creates a man who trusts no one.<br />I settled on 4 stars, because I couldn't get past the way the author brought the murder trial to its incredible conclusion.  Yes, it was unexpected....no, I couldn't get satisfaction from it.  Enough said!<br />Read it, it is somewhat unparalleled in today's courtroom fiction.	2002-07-03

Mike Daley, the unique, ex-priest turned criminal attorney, is back for his second outing.  Sheldon Siegel, a California attorney, made some people sit up and take notice when he published \\"Special Circumstances\\", in which he introduced Mike Daley.  This San Francisco based novel is every bit as good as his first, which is saying a lot!<br />One unique touch added by Siegel is his creative way of naming chapters, then giving a quote that would be taken from the fictional press at the time of his story.  I particularly enjoyed Chapter 2, entitled \\"The A__hole Premium\\", accompanied by the quote \\"The Hall of Justice isn't a big tourist attraction\\"...from the SF Police Chief, in the SF Chronicle.<br />Siegel creates a real whodunit, where no one is sure until the closing chapters.  The way in which the truth is parsed and stretched out by Siegel's client, who admits to it only when there is another unimpeachable source, is excellent and realistic.  \\"Skipper\\", the San Fransisco DA, who was introduced in the first novel, takes center stage, but this time as an accused murderer of a male prostitute.  One appealing new character is \\"Nick the Dick\\" Hanson, an 80+ and colorful PI who is legendary in the state, not just for his investigative skills, but for the way he controls a courtroom when he enters it.  Siegel takes us back and forth to court, interspersing his story with the dilemma of Mike and Rosie (his ex-wife) who are law partners and still deeply committed to each other, despite the divorce.<br />A terrific novel, with great characterization, a compelling plot, and the promise of more good things to come in the series!	2002-06-28

I enjoyed the 8th book in Evanovich's series; thought that the darkening of the plot and the very real threat posed by mobster Abruzzi turned the series in a direction I'd wanted to see.<br />As usual, in my crowd, when I'm the first to finish a new Evanovich, everyone else wants to know  - \\"Who was the sex with?\\"....and I'm not telling, although it was not as well interwoven with the novel as in the past.  I see other reviewers were not that shy, and did divulge!<br />Stephanie and her sister have a new hanger-on, Albert Kloughn (pronounced \\"clown\\", naturally), and he supplied some funny moments.  I was a little tired of the \\"no bullets in the gun\\" element of the plot, and I think Evanovich should realize that this probably wouldn't happen at this stage of Steph's career as a bounty hunter.  Good use of Vinnie, Connie & the inevitable Lula in this story - even showing that Lula can experience fear.<br />A nice follow up, maybe not as good as some of the earlier work, but definitely hard to put down!	2002-06-28

I'm amazed at how he goes to the top of the charts and then hangs around for awhile (just like Grisham) no matter what the quality of the book itself.  I kept reading because of plotline, but felt the characterization weak.<br />The Chimera plot is pretty intriguing, and not as muddled as Patterson can sometimes be when he has two or three trains of thought going.  I didn't enjoy the unveiling of Lindsay's father, and wouldn't have finished the book that way, but then, having a life-threatening tragedy threaten every one of the other 3 Murder Club members, was even worse.  I think I didn't enjoy this book because I'm just not charged up about Lindsay Boxer, herself...no Sharon McCone, Kat Kijewski or Kathy Mallory, Lindsay just doesn't draw the reader in, doesn't make you want to understand her quirks and passions.<br />Dialogue is less than stellar in this effort, and the attempt to bring the FBI in, with Lindsay showing them up, was tepid at best.  Difficult to know who to blame, Patterson or Gross; but I'm guessing Patterson is too enamored over the success of these \\"duet\\" books he's writing to insure he maintains what made him \\"buyable\\".<br />I probably won't return to this series, but am still hanging in with Alex Cross!<br />Wait for the paperback.  In fact, I'll probably be selling my 1st & 2nd to Die books on this site very soon, and I never get rid of a book for at least 3 years!	2002-06-17

Will enlists the help of his friend, Squares and Katy Miller, his first love's young sister.<br />He feels compelled to try to unravel what is happening, because the FBI and local law enforcement appear to be involved in a cover-up regarding his brother, Ken.<br />Squares is an enormously entertaining \\"yoga master\\" with a checkered past, and real devotion to his friendship with Will.<br />Another great character that Coben explores is John Asselta, a sociopathic acquaintance of Will's brother, known as \\"The Ghost\\".<br />All in all, Will encounters a lot of evil events in his search for Ken, a search that ends in a group encounter in the last chapter that has more plot twists and turns than I've ever seen.<br />Gone for Good is engrossing, well-written, and makes you care about Coben's main characters.  The women in the book, unlike many suspense novels, are well-defined, and you care what happens to them. Coben succeeds, where others fail, at defining relationships while he builds suspense.<br />Don't miss Coben's latest, it looks like it will top the charts for a good long while, and the only thing to criticize is the neon yellow dustjacket....although it is an improvement from \\"Tell No One's\\" deer hunter orange jacket!<br />Get it, and get into it, as soon as you can!	2002-06-01

Lucas' globetrotting arises when the FBI includes him in the hunt for Clara Rinker.  She's surfaced again<br />(Sandford introduced her in \\"Certain Prey\\", where she definitely got the better of Davenport) and the FBI wants her out of circulation.<br />Who better to help them than Davenport?  Although he's seeking revenge for a near-mortal blow that Rinker, the most effective hitwoman in the business, dealt him, Davenport has an instinct for what Clara would do, and that instinct helps keep the FBI close on her heels.  The FBI team is unaware that Davenport has made himself a member of a close circle of ex-cops in St. Louis, men who are bored with the retirement life, whose knowledge of the city helps give Davenport the clues the team needs to corner Rinker and end her local killing spree of crime bosses who sought to kill her and ended her engagement and pregnancy.  Loftus and Andreno, two of the local ex-cops, are great characters, and one would think that Sandford will bring them back.<br />This is Sandford's best work in awhile, and he's successful at alternating the point of view of his tale between Lucas and Rinker herself.  Rinker becomes multi-dimensional in the telling of the tale from her perspective.  The book is a nonstop thrillride of near-misses in getting to Rinker, and Davenport finishes it off with not one, but two, big surprises in the ending.<br />Sandford returns to masterful form, and you will not be able to put \\"Mortal Prey\\" down!	2002-06-01

I didn't figure it would be funny or refreshing, and was afraid of \\"the dark side\\" of wealthy parenting.  I finally succumbed, and my worst fears were realized.  The Nanny diaries is really heart-wrenching.<br />The book stars a \\"composite\\" nanny, telling the story of many events that are culled from the authors' and others own experiences, with (hopefully!) a touch of exaggeration.  The authors tell a compelling story, without a lot of writing skill, and feature \\"composites\\" of many socialite \\"mothers and fathers\\" that nannies have run into on the upper East Side, and in many homes throughout America.<br />Central to the story, and a great writers' trick, are the \\"notes\\"...the actual text and penmanship of directives given by Mrs. X to Nanny.  If you go through just the notes that she leaves, it becomes obvious that Mrs. X is so self-centered and mean, that there is no feeling sorry for her when her husband cheats with other women.  There are some very funny moments in the book, and an ongoing struggle between Nanny and the people she loves..P>The Nanny Diaries, in the guise of humor and satire, tells a cold<br />and difficult tale of family relationships, and makes you examine your own life to insure that the mistakes being made here are absent from yours.  Yes, it entertains, and is difficult to put down, but overall, the impact is not the gossip in NYC about \\"who they were really talking about\\"...its in the<br />disengagement of parents who shouldn't have been parents in the first place, and the feeling of helplessness that all caregivers have when they are not calling the shots...be they nannies, teachers, foster parents, what have you.<br />Thought provoking...the Nanny Diaries is an interesting read and a departure from my usual suspense thrillers.  No regrets at spending some time with this book!	2002-06-01

When Deb's well-meaning mother and a friend of Deb's daughter Becky (the friend has turned to prostitution) are woven into the story, the tale becomes cathartic for victims of sexual abuse, and gives the reader a sense of how difficult it is for the police who try to<br />solve these cases.<br />I found it to be an excellent of Lee Martin's writing of some of her own experiences through the eyes of her heroine, much like her other works, and felt the somber tone was in keeping with the nature of these crimes.<br />Read it if you can get your hands on it!	2002-05-27

Although not as interesting, plot-wise, as A Cold Day...this third instalment has a lot to recommend it.<br />The star of Hamilton's books is the setting....Michigan's Upper Peninsula; a region with so little charm that one wonders what keeps the natives there (yes, I've lived in northern Minnesota,<br />North Dakota, and some dreary areas in upstate New York, and all of us natives know that feeling of charm:  the lack thereof!).<br />Hamilton captures it perfectly, and surrounds an interesting hero with a lot of small-town sidekicks you want to come to know.<br />In this novel, Alex doesn't spend much time at home, but traipses around Michigan with a very old friend, Randy Wilkins, who he played minor-league ball with.  Randy is a character that MUST return, because he is such a well-drawn good time Charlie.<br />There's a lot of fits and starts....and probably too much complication in the quest for Maria, Randy's lost love.  In particular, both Randy and Maria turning out to be low-lifes is just a little too much unwelcome plot.  But, the story comes to a satisfactory close, with Alex eagerly returning to Paradise, and his favorite Canadian beer.<br />Not as good as his earlier work, but still much to enjoy in this novel!	2002-05-24

These spirits cry for release from being caught between two worlds as a result of an electric train accident....three of them have happened in different parts of the world.<br />Maxim's hero, Peter Halloran is just an ordinary man, living in Riverside, CT (Fairfield?), lamenting the status of a marriage gone loveless. On the day of the train disaster, he is late and misses the train, narrowly escaping death.  Later, he becomes aware that he can see the dead commuters, trapped in the spirit world, and giving off a kinetic energy that is trapping and destroying the townspeople.  At first he disbelieves his powers; then he gets drawn into the larger world of psychic phenomena, and the attempt to \\"help the victims over\\" when he meets Jennifer Wilde, a famous psychic.  The character of Jennifer is perhaps the best drawn element of the novel.  She travels with a strange entourage:  her assistant, Alex, who supplies the killing force when victims of the energy field begin to commit criminal acts, Mordicai Bloomer, another psychic nursing an unrequited love for Jennifer, and Lictor, her contact IN the spirit world.<br />In a tense and scary drama, Maxim weaves these characters in and out of trouble while they try to resolve the dilemma of the station and save those who are trapped.  There are some horrible secondary characters, such as Peter's wife, Barbara,but, all in all, Maxim tells a satisfying tale.<br />It was my first Maxim novel, and I'm encouraged to read the Bannerman books, based on how much I enjoyed this story.	2002-05-17

Married to Michel, of the French Resistance, Flick has been drawn into espionage by her love, but is practical enough to realize that Michel has feet of clay in the relationship department.<br />Follett's story tells of Flick's determination to lead a female group of spies on a critical mission in the days before the invasion.  They must take out a critical German post, and Flick is forced to use amateurs on her most important mission.  Follett<br />builds the suspense to its most critical in telling the tale, and does not spare romance or sadness in its conclusion.<br />Although Follett is fairly predictable in his writing, and his telling is straight-forward, without many interesting sidelines, the story is enjoyable and well told.	2002-05-17

Crusie really succeeds here with the tale of a young teacher who gets tired of her mundane life in a small town and tosses it over, only to find the excitement she craved at her doorstep.<br />There are all manners of plot devices represented here; the notable theme being long-term relationships and can two people ever stay together for a long time without growing in different directions.  Great insight into the teaching profession and \\"office politics\\" in public school academia, as well!<br />Crusie is lighthearted and unafraid to have her books fall into the \\"beach trash\\" category, and, in the manner of Evanovich, (without the mystery) goes way over the top with some of the plot twists.  This book, like her others, just cannot be put down!<br />One caution for new readers - Crusie makes the sex scenes in her books hot enough to need a small firefighting device close to the place you choose to read.  She has an incredible touch in describing how both men and women feel in their most passionate moments.<br />Look for Crusie to score big with her big with her next new novel...she has really developed a following!	2002-05-16

Fox takes you into his world during the &quot;Pinkie Rebellion&quot;, to the emotional flashback to his grandmother, (in the telling of the walnut tree episode and dream)&quot;Lucky Man&quot; does what MJF has always done.  It amuses and inspires, shares his insight and his dreams, gives nothing but honesty and fellowship to the reader.  Like Gary Goldberg, we, in reading through Michael's first &quot;written performance&quot; can see that spark of life that sets his performance apart from all others.<br />As Fox threads through his beginnings and growth during his struggle with Parkinson's disease, he gives us a window into his Canadian childhood, his family, his brief struggle for success, the pressures of TV/Movie stardom, and his close ties with friends and his young family.<br />The PD community is fortunate to have MJF represent them in the continuing struggle for funding and research, and to help the nation better understand the world they live in.  Michael who always could &quot;elude, evade and anticipate any obstacle or potential bully&quot; finds &quot;peace, security and spiritual strength to stand in one place&quot; through his battle with Parkinson's.<br />  A brief look at the remarkable and talented Tracy Pollan, as well, Fox paints a picture of a relatively young man coping with fate, yet looking back on a life we might all envy, with spirit and humility.<br />Fox has taken his small screen talents and transposed them in an autobiography that will both compel and entertain you.  What a marvelous read!	2002-04-29

Then a Marketplace seller had one that was used for a good price, which they shipped quickly.  Then I couldn't put the book down and read it in one sitting....<br />and enjoyed it thoroughly!  Pressure Points departs from the norm of the psychological chiller by setting it at a high-level corporate motivational seminar.  Many of us who have attended them think they put something in the kool-aid, and Brooks does nothing to dispel that notion.  From the name of the advertising agency where the seminar attendees work (Wright & Wong) to the<br />countdown to the seminar, to the seesaw back and forth between the seminar, Seattle, and Brad Teeters' journal, Larry Brooks knows how to set a stage.  The seminar events are somewhat predictable, but, just when you relax, Brooks pulls another stunt that wakes you back up and makes you wonder if you really know how this is gonna end!<br />I've given it 4 stars instead of 5, because Brooks' male character development (Brad, Mark, Ken) is excellent, but his females ( Beth and Pamela ) are less than believable.  Pamela, especially, completely changes her character while attending the seminar in a way that makes little sense, and Beth is just a little too over the top as the puppeteer of so many characters.<br />That said, there is little else to critique about Pressure Points, and believe me, you will find it difficult to put down!	2002-04-29

Kaminsky succeeds in fleshing out some of the characters he introduced in Vengeance, and gives us some quirky new ones in this tale of revenge.  It seems that famous, reclusive author Conrad Lonsberg,<br />who is hiding from the world in plain sight, in beautiful Sarasota, is the subject of a vendetta.  His rich portfolio of unpublished books, the heritage for his grandchildren, has disappeared, taken by the young Adele, a foster teen from Kaminsky's earlier work.  Adele is destroying the work, piece by piece, to avenge some unknown issue caused by Lonsberg.  Along the way, people associated with Adele keep turning up dead.<br />Kaminsky succeeds in keeping Adele's motivation a secret until the climax of the novel.  Once again, the quirky Fonesca is able to win the hearts and minds of those he meets, simply by being himself, even as he struggles with his own sadness.<br />Dr. Horowitz, Flo, Adele, Sally and Ames are all back, and Kaminsky continues to draw them in watercolor while he makes stunning observations about the beauty of the Sarasota region, and contrasts it to the honky-tonk parts of town.  In addition, he uses the quirk of defining Lew by detailed descriptions of the food he eats, much as Lawrence Sanders did with his odd heroes and heroines.<br />There is a subplot involving a character called Crazy Marvin, that we could do without, but the moments spent by Lew helping a homeless man called Digger are priceless.<br />Kaminsky continues to have success profiling a very ordinary man<br />in a very unusual business.  Bravo!	2002-03-25

Robb paperback as soon as it comes out and find the futuristic stories about Eve Dallas, Robb's tough female cop to be truly engaging.<br />The villain of this tale is a woman Eve has faced before, and she is identified quickly, but is not so easy to catch!  I really enjoyed the final confrontation between Julianna and Eve,<br />loved meeting Peabody's warm hearted parents, and found the bit about Eve visiting the wide open spaces of Texas very funny!  A really terrific subplot involves Eve giving Peabody her own case, and teaching and delegating in a way that gives Peabody just the right amount of independence.  Eve Dallas, repeating the pattern taught by her own mentor....<br />Not enough Mavis or Nadine in the novel, and Robb backs off of the Charles/Laura relationship, and a little bit off McNab/Peabody that were introduced in prior books.  I think the books need more of their support.<br />This book completes the first year cycle of Eve's marriage to Roarke, as they celebrate their anniversary, and we can hope that Robb will not grow tired of her feisty lieutenant before their second anniversary.<br />Definitely worth buying!	2002-03-25

Phobias and obsessive compulsive disorders are brought to the forefront through case studies, and in each, Dr. Dumont not only describes the behaviors, she describes the accompanying thoughts.<br />It is an interesting book to explore, because she has been able to put into words how some people can depart from reality, despite their intellectual capacity.  She helps make their fears real, not only for them, but for their support systems.<br />There is an excellent part of the book that is devoted to a tolerance and treatment program; and also a description of the role of medication and other resources for those afflicted by anxiety in this fundamentally life-shattering way.  It is an excellent introduction for those who need the treatment to understand why a therapist trained to help them will be able to help them break through the barriers, but it is also a realistic awakening that this is a life-changing regimen that they will need to practice to insure that they gain control of their lives forever, and are not controlled instead, by the phobia or the OCD.<br />One of the very best books ever written to gain insight on panic disorders, Dr. Dumont expands our sensitivity and awareness to the need for cognitive behavior therapy.<br />Simply a must read for OCD-sufferers and their friends!	2002-03-25

Into NOT enjoying Barbara Parker's 6th outing for the legal couple, Anthony Quintana/Gail Connor.  It is certainly a stretch to believe that Connor, a civil attorney, and a sole practitioner at that, would become involved with a death-penalty appeals case.  Forgiving that, sit back and enjoy what is Parker's most ambitious and well-written tale of the series!<br />In it, some of the past jealousy dances over Connor's relationship with her ex-husband do not play a role, and her civil practice and single parenting responsibilities don't dominate the story line, as they have in past outings (this is positive; Quintana's jealousy does not become him).  Nor does Quintana appear as self-assured and in control of situations in the \\"wilds\\" of northern Florida, as he does in his native<br />Miami.  One of the most important and touching passages of the book deals with his realization and communication to Connor that she is a better attorney than is he, himself, because of the passion and dedication with which she serves her clients.<br />The client, Kenny Ray Clark, is on his final stretch of death row in Florida for a murder it becomes obvious he did not commit.  Central to proving this is the role played by a new character, Jackie Bryce, a local deputy, and Connor's cousin.<br />Connor's family relationships are the background focus of the tale, and the sense of desperation the group feels while racing the clock to prove that someone else killed Amber Dodson and covered up the murder by blaming Kenny Ray, is palpable. Although there are a lot of victims in this tale, few are as tragic as the Mendozas, a local immigrant family who found themselves in the way of a land grab by the real perpetrator's of Amber's murder.  You'll find yourself unable to put the book down as Connor and Quintana peel away the layers of the cover up, in a race against death.<br />Strong characterization, tense and thrilling plotline, and her signature byproduct of the incredible bond between Quintana and Connor all will heighten your enjoyment of this Parker<br />effort.<br />Read all 6, Parker is a terrific storyteller!and Connor all will heighten your enjoyment of this Parker<BR>effort.<br />Read all 6, Parker is a terrific storyteller!	2002-03-13

Of course, that is probably because I'm a woman who wanted to see Dirty Harry evolve, as well....nevertheless, here's what I thought of Tripwire...<br /> \\"Tripwire\\" is the third outing for Lee Child's Jack Reacher, and the first in which the much-decorated soldier finally appears to want to put down roots in his post-military<br />saga.<br />Lee Child cures most of his writing style issues in his story of a brutal and sadistic villain, Hook Hobie, and his way of life following his unlikely escape from a firestorm in Vietnam.<br />Hobie is a devastating foe, and his willingness to kill and pursue pain in order to cover up his past knows no bounds. His motivation, once his identity is known to Reacher, is still a mystery, that remains so until the end of the book. Caught in the crossfire is Reacher's former commander, Garber, and through his death both Reacher and Garber's daughter Jodie are caught up in the killing fields of Hobie's need for cover. The situation is made more complex by the military regime's need to also continue the cover up, but for different reasons.  Reacher's reaction to Jodie is a central force in the novel,<br />His feelings for her go back fifteen years.  This might be the central lynchpin that has Child turning his future story line around from Reacher the wanderer to Reacher, the same investigative force in civilian life as he was in the military.<br />Child, whose willingness to describe savagery and weaponry in detail in past novels, does not change his focus, but does change the level of detailed description, in a positive way.<br />His eye for the upstate New York landscape and the level of descriptiveness he uses in his setting in Tripwire much improve the plot.  It's a big plot, with great flashback sequences to Vietnam and to the early days of Reacher & Jodie's relationship, and interesting and well-researched detail into the counterfeit currency trade.<br />Lee Child scores big and leaves the reader anxious for his next Reacher novel,  \\"Running Blind.\\"<br />Enjoy.detail into the counterfeit currency trade.<br />Lee Child scores big and leaves the reader anxious for his next Reacher novel,  \\"Running Blind.\\"<BR>Enjoy.	2002-03-13

In bringing his hero, Alan Gregory, to life, White also gets to pursue, in words, his love affair with the western Rocky Mountains, particularly in Colorado.  He has the ability to weave the beauty of the region, and its downfalls, into his story line in a natural and compelling way.  Show me a reader who does not want to see Colorado after finishing a White novel!<br />There is no question that White has done what most authors of thrillers cannot do, and that is to maintain the quality of his story lines and characterization based on the same group of characters, time after time.  I don't believe he has stumbled in this effort, and in pursuing the Gregory storyline, he has won over many fans of other writers who have fallen prey to commercialism.  In past years, White has become my author of choice, the author whose works I immediately buy regardless of price.  Writing this, unfortunately, may help too many others to discover him, and hopefully he won't come blazing into the public eye, with too much pressure to write &quot;hits&quot; or &quot;blockbusters&quot; to take away the thoughtful manner in which he sets his plotlines before he begins his story.<br />Warning Signs weaves the continuing struggle of Gregory's wife, Lauren's, MS, throughout the novel, contrasting her coping ability with that of Susan Peterson, the wife of the local DA, who is mysteriously murdered in the early part of the novel.  As the story unfolds, White is able to interweave three plotlines, including a crisis of practice for Gregory in terms of when danger and potential harm to others outweigh the need for doctor patient privilege.  Gregory doesn't handle the situation appropriately, but his own feelings and the reactions of the public and his circle of close friends help to make this situation even more real for the reader.<br />A story of the abandoned offspring of a central character plays a key role in the mystery, and again leaves us questioning the psychological motivation of characters who seem ordinary on the surface; this daughter is struggling with the meaning of intimacy, and she promises to be a new continuing character in future Gregory novels.<br />Lastly, in the wake of Columbine and Jon Benet, Gregory is able to explore the feeling of confusion and despair that must invade the Colorado population, when confronted with the media spotlight on how parents and law enforcement personnel react to sudden and unexpected crimes of violence in the seemingly serene Colorado setting.  Although the &quot;Columbine-like&quot; plotline is a little farfetched, it is ultimately the vehicle that builds into the climax of the novel, and White does a credible job of building the tension and relief when the violence finally ends.<br />Lastly, White is able to showcase Gregory and Lauren in still another setting; as new parents of baby daughter Grace.  This is a book that is chockful of great storylines and suspense, and difficult to put down when you want to finish it in one sitting.<br />Another terrific novel by Stephen White!uestioning the psychological motivation of characters who seem ordinary on the surface; this daughter is struggling with the meaning of intimacy, and she promises to be a new continuing character in future Gregory novels.<br />Lastly, in the wake of Columbine and Jon Benet, Gregory is able to explore the feeling of confusion and despair that must invade the Colorado population, when confronted with the media spotlight on how parents and law enforcement personnel react to sudden and unexpected crimes of violence in the seemingly serene Colorado setting.

Child's first novel about the anti-hero, Reacher, \\"The Killing Floor\\", was complex and compelling; and hard to put down.  Some of his narrative was definitely the work of a \\"first-time\\" author.  I looked forward to reading about Reacher in series, assuming the plots would stay action-packed, and the writing would improve.<br />\\"Die Trying\\", the sequel, does not disappoint.  It is a fast-paced read sketched out along the same lines as Child's first novel, but in a \\"Montana militia\\" setting.  Child's writing style, unfortunately, has not improved.  He mimics the contrivances of the first novel:  coincidental involvement of Reacher in a major crime, the necessary female entanglement, the incredible string of violence that finally leads up to Reacher being able to exit to continue his poor man's tour around the country.  That's OK, but there is also a ton of repetitive writing - from the detailed description of every weapon Reacher touches or sees in the book, to the numerous times his captors should have done him in, only to see him elude them, but ultimately lose his freedom (but not his life) instead.  Child is also guilty of having his characters repeat phrases over and over, and this appears to be a problem of bad editing.<br />Despite these broad areas of criticism, I gotta admit that its incredibly hard to put a Jack Reacher novel down.  Reacher is resourceful and the author succeeds in capturing your attention with every twist of plot.<br />So...on to Tripwire, the 3rd in the series!	2002-02-24

Relatively unheralded, Philpin's hero, Lucas Frank, a forensic psychologist with a bent for action is funny, insightful and makes the book difficult to put down.<br />Philpin alternately narrarates the book from Lucas' point of view, and that of the serial killer, Felix Zrbny (whose chapters are in italics).  Generally, I feel that when authors trade off narration between characters, I'm always spinning through the chapters from the storyteller I don't like, to get to the ones I do.  That is not the case here - Zrbny is as intricately drawn as Lucas himself, and, you find it difficult to believe that what draws him to kill and to seek his freedom from an institution is a need to be famous, to seek prime-time notoriety.  It just doesn't fit with the Felix you come to know through the chapters he narrates; in part, you are drawn to his humanity, although it is obvious that, in his delusions, he is a most dangerous man.<br />There are some interesting supporting characters - media types from the BTT (the local Boston version of Court TV), the institution that Felix has called home for 15 years, Lucas' friend Bolton, who draws him into the case, and the husband of one of the early victims, Waycross, who comes into play in an unusual twist of plot late in the novel.<br />This is a nearly perfect book, a little less so because some of the violence is overplayed and unnecessary.  It certainly has interested me in the works of Philpin, who combines the best attributes of a thriller with the sardonic wit of the hero.<br />A real find....read it soon!	2002-02-24

Each remaining person, that is, because the book opens with the suspicious murder of Roger Cresswell, a killing that keeps tying back to Maggie Cresswell, his sister, who had been a victim of what seemed like suicide in a prior year.  Anthony's daughter Angela, returns, getting Gail involved in the criminal defense (not a specialty of Gail's) to defend the boy she loves, dancer Bobby Gonzalez.  Although Bobby is entangled in the background of the killing, so many of the Cresswells have motive, and so few of them have any admirable qualities, it seems that Gail and Anthony, working together against their better judgement, must pull the responsibility back to one of them, but whom?<br />Both Anthony and Gail, single parents and very different in heritage and background, leave the reader wondering about their attraction, and attraction it is, despite their break up in a prior instalment of the series.  Although they remain together at the end of the book, it is only with some tragedy in their own lives, which draws the reader even closer to them.<br />The Miami setting is well-told in Parker's novels, and the romance never interferes with the mystery, just enhances it.  A great read from a fine writer!	2002-02-19

If you like legal thrillers you will finish this book.<br />That said, it wasn't written badly enough to put down in the middle, and the murder victim, Tanner, in the first chapter, nags at you so you have to finish.  But when you're done, you'll feel like you just had one of those little cups of sugar-free jello.  Not much taste, not much to remember, you'll be hungry again as soon as it's finished.<br />Characterization is only adequate, with the heroine, Casey Jordan, being forgettable from her first appearance in the novel.  \\"Casey stood before the jury with the power and the majesty of a Celtic princess\\"  ?????  Casey does slay the dragon, an impotent serial killer that teaches at law school, but there are plenty of details about his kills that are shared with the reader before she traps him in the wilderness, instead of the courtroom.<br />This was my first Tim Green book, but his courtroom scenes were patently unreal, and there was really no character to like or to identify with in the book.  I'm told Green uses football as a backdrop in his prior books.  I like football, so I'm not sure I'll want to read Green's attempts with the game.<br />Picked up the book in an airport book store when I'd desperately finished the last one, and my next flight was late.  Next time I'll bring a second book rather than take a chance on having to finish an eminently forgettable plot.	2002-02-19

Simon's career in forensic psychology causes him to meet Janice Jensen - one of those villainesses that is really too evil to be as beautiful as she is.

The last four in the series have been very disappointing to many of his long time fans, and Kellerman goes back to basics with this tale of a disappearance/murder that personally affects the good doc, since it happened to a former patient that he was never able to reach.<br />In the novel, the old obsessive compulsive Alex Delaware surfaces again.  He takes the crime personally, and continues to follow up some blind alleys, driving both Milo and Robin crazy with his inability to let it go.  His instincts are basically good, however, and you second guess the multitude of possible outcomes all the way through the book's end.<br />It feels as though Kellerman has decided to ground the doctor in the type of cases and well-intentioned investigations he crafted for Delaware in the early books of the series.  It is good to have the real Alex back, and to have Kellerman fully flesh out a story, unlike the botched and tedious plots of &quot;Monster&quot; and &quot;The Web&quot;.<br />With this book, Kellerman wins back a fan!	2002-01-13

Never really having to pay for all the grief he caused the families he cheated, the women he abused, and the children he scarred, Blackthorne is unprepared for the consequences of his revenge on his third wife, Sheila Bellush, who has remarried and is trying to start over.<br />If you live in the San Antonio or Sarasota areas, you followed the story of Sheila's bloody murder in the presence of her 4 toddlers with disbelief.  As the confederates who plotted the kill were revealed in the media, it was with disbelief that you<br />recognized them for the heartless bumblers they were.  Indeed, there is much speculation in Rule's book about how one so crafty and wealthy as Blackthorne spent so little to hire &quot;the three stooges&quot; to carry out his plot.<br />But, as you walk away and wonder about what makes the murderers tick, you are also appalled at the ordinary people who knew that something bad was being planned for Sheila by her ex-husband, and who did nothing to stop the madness.<br />Rule is at her best, although the trial phase is a little overlong.  She places equal importance on explaining what led up to the crime, the crime itself, and always makes the law enforcement team come alive for the reader.  She should be very successful with this story of murder for hire, as, once again, she's able to explain the &quot;why's&quot; behind the &quot;what's&quot; in contemporary modern tragedy.<br />Bravo, Ann!	2002-01-13

In his new novel, Koontz tries a mix of old and new, and seems to have taken to heart much of the criticism he received after his last book.  He has done much better work earlier in his career, but this effort perhaps will get him back on the track of things that made him so successful in prior books (Intensity, Whispers, etc.)<br />Like From the Corner, Koontz creates a &quot;tribe&quot; of mismatched people who are brought together in an unusual way and who gravitate to the children in the center of the story.  Koontz uses three different story lines, which begin to mingle in the center of the book.<br />Prior to the plots' combination, I was impatient with the writing.  I found the stories of Noah and Micky/Leilani to be engaging and realistic, and, unlike his heroes in From the Corner, all of them had warts and quirks and just didn't &quot;radiate goodness&quot;.  I was particularly impressed with the character of Micky, and her reaction to someone who has had more trouble in life than even Micky has had in her own life.  A great heroine that Koontz can bring back, if he likes!Interesting characterizations, although perhaps Leilani and Aunt Geneva were a little too over the top.  In these two stories, Koontz also clarified his two villains, Dr. Doom and Sensimilla, although they just seemed misguided and strange at first.  As the stories intertwine, we really get a taste of just how evil they both are.  Again, Koontz returns to form in the characterization of the villains.<br />The third story (and Koontz skips and alternates between stories in each chapter) was just a little too much too absorb.(Translation, it dragged for me and was boring.)  Although the extra-terrestrial, &quot;Curtis&quot; who carries the story line, is interesting and funny, in this story we get way too much in the way of descriptive passages about the geography and about Curtis' social ineptness. Once more, the Koontz signature plotline is present, with this hero communing with a Golden Retriever.  I love Goldens, don't have a problem with Koontz utilizing them in all his books, but I really dislike the whole &quot;dog mysticism&quot; that Koontz advocates, with repetitive passages about the relationship between boy and dog (the dog is his &quot;sister-becoming&quot;, a phrase that must be used at least 80 times in the book).  This relationship culminates in a far-fetched utopia of people/dogs at the end of the novel, that really wasn't necessary.<br />With all that said, the social issues of bioethics and the thrill of battling evil and uncovering the true nature of the extra terrestrial make for a satisfying climax to the book, one that made the read worthwhile.<br />I'll buy another Koontz when it comes out, but not sure of my long-term commitment. If his spiritual experiences with dogs and need to layer multi-part plots keep trying to overshadow the humorous characterizations and fast-paced thrill aspects of future books, I'll give up.  Had this book come from another writer, I might not be as critical, but want Koontz to realize how some of his writing patterns have disappointed his large audience.<br />Probably rent from a library, buy used, or wait for the paperback!etriever.

Lelia Kelly's heroine once more surprises the reader by not following any pre-established rules of the game as a prosecutor. Kelly presents the interesting point of view, of what a prosecutor faces, when he/she knows the person on trial is really innocent of the crime.  Chastain follows her own moral code, and not necessarily what the law, or the pattern of activities we have allowed to surround the law, dictates.<br />While delving into the story of the death of Lawrence Belew, Kelly gives us an accurate picture of today's Atlanta, with all of its finer points, and warts, on display.  There is an incident of road rage that is becoming typical for the Atlanta road system, which, despite its growth, can't possibly keep up with the sprawl of the city.  Kelly also gives us a satsifying look at Laura's relationship with Amos Kowalski, and keeps us guessing at the motivation and eventual uncovering of the true killer in the Belew murder.<br />Difficult to put down, Kelly has once again succeeded in a satisfying portrayal of today's courtroom through the eyes of her young prosecutor.  Unlike many series, Kelly's seems to just get better and better!	2002-01-02

Vector not only deals with Cook's trademark medical disaster, but continues to outline their relationship in a satisfying way.<br />Cook has written a precursor to this fall's anthrax scares, set in the heart of New York City.  He adroitly gives the reader a picture of the &quot;new Brooklyn&quot;, and its population of immigrant Russians, although Yuri, the scientist who creates the anthrax, is not atypical of the generation of Russians who have resettled parts of Brooklyn, and made it their own.  He also introduces some surprises in terms of locating a sect of white Aryan supremacists in New York City, something I didn't expect, but, after all, this is the Big Apple, and it has something for everyone.  Casting these folks as firefighters is kind of the final irony of the story, given the events after September 11 of this year.<br />It is a good, fast-paced tale, somewhat moralistic, and well-defines the hazards of dealing with bioterrorism, both for the terrorists, and for the victims.  The twist at the end, of Yuri's eventual doublecross of his partners, is unexpected and satisfying.<br />A good read for Robin Cook, and almost scary in the way some of the plot angles played out, in light of events since the book was published!	2002-01-02
US	45979403	R2GN1ZV02NXY10	0385334834	51290485	Writ of Execution	Books	5	6	6	N	Y	A chance meeting between clients	Jessie Potter, a doomed young woman with a secret, and Kenny Leung, one of the more confused characters in fiction this year, leads to a casino jackpot and a need for Nina Reilly, in her seventh outing, to try to make sense of it all.  Jessie defines the concept of self-sufficiency, and Kenny defines haplessness, despite his brilliance in the computer field, so their collaboration gives the book a light tone.  The courtroom adversaries for Reilly are pretty ruthless, and used to a larger setting than what they find in Tahoe...it is hard to believe that Nina will prevail.  Nina's independence, her relationship with her family (played down a little in this book), the spectacular scenery that is Tahoe, and the depressing world of casino gambling all play a role in this novel.  Sandy, Nina's irrepressible secretary, is back, and is as feisty as ever.<br />I'm always fascinated by the concept of sisters who live at a distance (Pamela and Mary O'Shaughnessy) writing a series together.  You really can't tell where one begins and the other leaves off, such is the seamlessness of their collaboration.  Reilly has been incredibly entertaining in each outing, and although there are some pitfalls in this story, overall, it keeps you enthusiastic, entertained and happy with the outcome.<br />One issue with the series is the unresolved relationship between Reilly and Paul van Wagoner, her terrific investigator.  This book continued the dance that is their life together.  I'd like for O'Shaughnessy to resolve this one way or the other, and, at the end, it appears that a resolution may be under way for the next book.....but that is what you say each time you finish a Nina Reilly novel.<br />A really entertaining and worthwhile series with a great heroine!	2002-01-02

If you've kept up with Martini and his courtroom hero, Paul Madriani, this story will surprise you, based on pace.  However, the twist of the tale, described in the last two chapters, makes the book worth a read.<br />Madriani's sidekick, Harry, is well-drawn in the story, and is impatient with the goings-on, much like the reader.  Many have commented on Martini's play on words with the title - it is evident that his point here was how little a jury might influence the outcome of a trial, and how much vests on just what the legal representation does outside the courtroom.<br />Very few of the characters catch your eye or your sympathies in the book, least of all Madriani's client, the unsympathetic Crone.<br />Be patient with this book, the ending is worth the read!	2002-01-02

James Patterson follows up on &quot;Roses are Red&quot; with a novel about serial killing packed with violence and gore.<br />Some things to praise:<br />Alex Cross is truly at the crossroads of career, and it seems certain that he will make some changes in his life based on how much he realizes that the path he has chosen in career hurts the path of the life he wants to lead as a man and a parent.<br />Violets are Blue is hard to set down.  The action is cross-country, and the Mastermind plot is woven in with a horrendous series of serial murders that seem to be driven by vampires.<br />The conclusion of the vampire segment is surprising and satisfying.<br />Some things that hurt the novel:<br />Another new female interest....it seems too soon after his last two relationships, and the introduction of Jamilla seems as though she will be a character in books to come.  She is not very interesting here, so hopefully Patterson will be able to grow the character in the future.<br />The answer to the Mastermind plot is far too obvious, and you keep hoping that it will be a last-minute surprise.  Too out of character for Alex to not sense the evil in the person who is revealed as the Mastermind.<br />I love the crispness and shortness of Patterson's chapters, but, in this book, he gets carried away, turning his style into choppiness instead of the effect of the technique in earlier books.<br />I can't say I didn't enjoy reading Violets are Blue, but, the novel pales next to the earlier Alex Cross offerings.  Will there be a &quot;Sugar is Sweet&quot;?  Most likely, and hopefully Patterson will put more into his plot line and his characterization, to revive the Cross franchise.	2001-12-25

With the 2001 movie starring Michael Douglas (probably good in the role, although I don't equate him physically with Nathan Conrad), I decided to revisit the book I once enjoyed before I see the movie (probably on DVD when it comes out).  I was not disappointed.  Klavan writes a suspenseful tale, but also tells the story of a very old-fashioned modern day marriage between Conrad and his admirable wife Agatha, a romance that is disrupted when his young daughter is kidnapped.<br />Central to the suspense is the tie in to a new patient of Conrad's, Elizabeth Burrows.  The mystery encompasses her relationship to  the kidnappers, who are observing the Conrad's from the apartment across the way, while pretending they have hidden a camera and microphones in the Conrad apartment.<br />Klavan uses an interesting author's palette, telling the story by the use of various points of view for various chapters, weaving the story as viewed by Conrad, Agatha, Elizabeth, and the head of the kidnapping gang, a cruel man known as &quot;Sport&quot;.<br />The book is hard to put down, because your expectation is not of a happy ending.  Klavan focuses more on events and dialogue than he does on character motivation and development, which makes for a brisk, page-turner of a suspense novel.<br />Klavan is an interesting author, formerly a journalist, of many suspense novels, and this, one of his oldest, is also one of his best.<br />Enjoy!	2001-12-09

It is a good way for the reader to begin to question the man who was her husband, seeing the inconsistencies in his life and in their relationship through her eyes.<br />The mystery of why the plane that Jack was flying crashed is a simple one, but it keeps bringing you back to the book quickly, whenever you put it down.  Kathryn's characterization is strong, as is Robert's, the agent assigned to help protect her when the incident occurs.  The remaining characters in the book are drawn in a more shallow fashion.<br />You will like &quot;The Pilot's Wife&quot;, even if you find yourself able to predict the outcome, and can use it to meet Anita Shreve, a perceptive voice in today's fiction.	2001-12-09

The reality of the criminal courtroom in her series is really not the time in court (punctuated by unexpected admissions of guilt or anguish by witnesses or defendants, that you see in TV courtrooms) but the planning, strategy and negotiation that goes on before the trial starts, during the trial, in and around the offices of the defense and the prosecutor, and the location where the defendant is held until the trial is concluded.<br />Without the hystrionics, Wilhelm's courtroom may be a little too colorless for both, as well might her main character, Barbara,<br />who has no quirky behaviors or hidden secrets.  Barbara's main relationship in life is with her attorney father - another reason why the series may be too boring for those who like the addition of sex and violence.<br />Nevertheless, the straightforward telling of a murder case that may have been a suicide was difficult for me to put down, and the final actions and reactions that reveal the murderer, and a lot of the town secrets, kept me guessing up to the final pages.<br />Throw in some terrific writing about scenic Oregon (most of us will learn for the first time about the desert in the eastern part of the state), and a bit of comedy connected with Frank Holloway's budding career as a writer, and you get a terrific tale that you will really enjoy.<br />A talented, award-winning novelist who can outcraft the &quot;attorneys who are also novelists&quot;, Wilhelm will quickly become a favorite for you.	2001-12-06

Brady, the sheriff of Cochise County not only solves some pretty tough crimes with a lot of personal involvement in this novel, she has a new emotional mix to balance.  With her new marriage and a &quot;house husband&quot; and a daughter who is just beginning the throes of teenage angst, Brady exhibits some of the emotional stress that comes with the territory of being a wife, mother and career woman.<br />Jance once again treats us to the wild beauty of the deserts she was raised in, while giving us some reality of the tedium/political balance and danger that involves police work, particularly for women in management.  Brady is drawn in a more complex faction, and Jance is wise to insure that she makes some mistakes and acts in ways that we shake our heads at from time to time.  The supporting cast is also strongly drawn, and its nice to not like Jenny, Brady's daughter very much -- the writer gives a picture of a real teen, not just an accessory to the family. Jenny's personally involved in finding the first of three bodies in homicides that occur in a few days in Cochise County.  The murders, which appear to be related, are, in a sort of &quot;domino theory&quot; way.  In addition, the problems of meth labs in the wilderness, unregistered aliens and carjackings in southern Arizona are highlighted, helping the reader understand what a difficult piece of real estate Brady has inherited as sheriff.<br />In this book, we actually get some insight and humanity from Brady's mother, Eleanor, for the first time!  Eleanor's own second marriage is described in realistic terms, as is the infighting and small conflicts of the sheriff's troop.<br />I'm always anxious to buy and consume a new Jance novel; her heroine has not grown stale and shows promise of more complexity and action-oriented stories in the future.<br />Great read!	2001-11-23

This, the 13th instalment, shows no signs of being stale, although in 13 books, the time element has moved in the series only about a year.  Nora/JD is incredibly innovative in her mix of plotlines, and juggles the romance element (not my favorite part!) admirably with the suspense and police procedural elements<br />to keep readers interested and make her books hard to put down.<br />In this outing, Eve Dallas, tougher than ever, follows up on a series of brutal sex crimes/killings perpetrated by a man who meets his targets and seduces them online.  All the familiar back up characters are here...I especially love the backdrop of Mavis and her entourage partying in the background while Dallas and Roarke are consumed by solving the crime.  We get an end (a beginning?) here of the Peabody/McNab/Charles triangle, in a very satisfying way...and, once again, Nora/JD leaves some breadcrumbs for those who are thinking it is time for Dallas to start a family.<br />Just a great, light mystery series by a writer who is not always taken seriously, but who never fails to entertain!  5 stars as one of the best in the &quot;In Death&quot; series.	2001-11-23

Warshawski is so contentious	in this novel, I don't believe there is anyone in the book that she doesn't &quot;mix it up with&quot;, other than her current love interest Morrell.  There is a lot of the story dialogue wasted on arguments with Vic, insults to and from Vic and misunderstandings with Vic.  There is so much to be admired about Paretsky's Chicago heroine, it is doubtful that the reader will enjoy seeing her turned from being feisty in career and relationships to downright stubborn and opinionated.<br />The ending of this story, with its insight into Lotty Herschel's past and persona, is touching, and makes the book worth finishing.  An interesting premise, dealing with Holocaust reparations, is spoiled when it is entwined with Chicago politics, hypnosis, and a slightly demented protagonist known as Paul Radbuka.<br />There is lots of action, but it feels as though VI is trotting back and forth all over town, tying up loose ends to an annoying, rather than thrilling, series of events.  In the final outcome, the villains are implausible, although the reader doesn't really care who's responsible, he/she just wants to learn what the shrouded past of Doctor Lotty is, and what is causing her to behave in such an uncommon way.<br />Not a good follow up to Hard Time, and hopefully, Paretsky will be a little more innovative in her choice of theme in future VI<br />Warshawsky novels.	2001-11-23

His friendship with Rhoda turns into<br />a partnership that leads them back in time, and through some terrifying moments, to discover the full truth.<br />Muller uses different points of view, most notably that of the newest victim, explored before her death takes place, to weave her tale.  One of Muller's strong points is her character development; many of the characters here are rich with strong opinions, and no one in this small town can cast stones at any of the other residents - all have contributed to the decay and depression that pervades, and the cynicism that arises from that feeling. Also an impressive creator of scenic areas that come alive under her pen, Muller gives us a stark view of the crime scenes and the forest canyon area that contains the murder secrets of the past.<br />You'll find the book difficult to put down once you've started, so set aside some time!	2001-11-04

What kind of penny?  The kind that is made out of lead?<br />This is a truly bad novel.  Although Cornwall supposedly has tongue in cheek, the icons of the noble state of Virginia that are somewhat related to this horrendous mishmash of &quot;humor&quot; have every right to send Cornwall packing.<br />The governor is downright senile, his family too ridiculous for words, the people of the island of Tangier are made to look ridiculous, instead of the charming back-country types they really are. Cornwall manages to poke &quot;fun&quot; at lesbians, Christians, dog lovers and the old TV show, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, in a way that makes you wonder what each or any of these constituencies ever did to her.  This is not black humor, just vile writing.<br /> The villains are incredibly shallow, but the worst is the hero, Andy Brazil, who has come up with some obnoxious website by an alter ego named &quot;Trooper Truth&quot;.  The reader is supposed to believe that by discussing DNA, Mummies, the real history of Virginia and pirates, that his erstwhile web site somehow captures the imagination of the whole state, and all who see it are intrigued by it.<br />As Trooper Truth would say...&quot;Be careful out there!  Cornwall may decide to write another &quot;black humor book&quot; to insure that she punishes her publisher for making her write so much so quickly.&quot;  It is obvious that the pace of turning out a book a year has far exceeded her ability to put interesting words on a page.<br />Don't buy it, don't take it out of the library, don't even wrap your trash in it.	2001-10-30

Enemy Within captured my imagination and attention a little less than earlier books in the series.<br />Don't get me wrong, I'm still quite taken with the Karp daughter, Lucy, although the freedom she is granted to move about any and all dank corner of NYC, making friends of the homeless, is a little bit of a stretch.  Some old friends from the series return, although their bits are far too small -- Hrcany, Guma, Newberry and one of Tanenbaum's best, Tran.  Butch himself is<br />worrying his way through middle age, and is believable in his motivation and his frustration at the lack of normalcy in either his work or family life.  (Oh, if only he realized that this is true of everyone in their 40's!)<br />The sour note is the author's decision to drive Marlene to drink.  And spend.  And drink. And spend.  And drink.  And, having tried to fit this zany, opinionated Italian lady into that mold, Tanenbaum does not do the reader any favors by asking us to believe that she can then shake herself out of it without professional help, simply because she is motivated to take down some bad guys and stop ignoring her daughter and help resolve the murders she is involved in.<br />Marlene takes the book from 4 stars to 3.  Is it time for a change in the series?  Perhaps so, the DA's office has been thoroughly dismembered in the series, perhaps Butch needs a judgeship.  Perhaps Marlene needs to have at least one child learning disabled, so she can devote her considerable skills to something that matters.<br />Still, the series that best showcases all the slices of life that are NYC, continues to appeal, even when exploring the wildly rumored underground terrors that haunt the city and maintain the myth.<br />Perhaps best purchased used or borrowed from the library!	2001-10-30

There was a lot of gratuitous violence south of the border; but probably this is based in what the author has really found in his career in law enforcement in the southwest.<br />McGarrity struggles a little with his writing style - he paints a scenic picture well, but was just starting out in character development and dialogue.<br />Worth the read to start the Kerney series; the author continues to develop and satisfy the reader.	2001-09-24

This, the 13th book, showed a lot more promise than the 12th book, &quot;Stalker&quot;.<br /> It was interesting to see where time has taken the relationship between Peter and Rina, but even better to watch Kellerman weave the complex relationship between son Jacob and his parents into the novel.<br />The premise, senseless vandalism and violence at the Deckers' temple, is a strong one. One of the perpetrators, Ernesto Golding, an affluent young man with strong signs of adolescent OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) is caught, but does not give up his partners. This is where Kellerman departs from the firm foundation of the novel and stretches needlessly into several murders, sexual obsession and fraudulent SAT preparation. Had she stayed with the story of Ernesto and explored his relationship with his ancestors, parents and brother; perhaps had him struggle with other crimes based on his obsessions, we might have had a fine book.<br />Instead, she introduces the character of Ruby, and the story and plotline go downhill from there. The assignation of Ruby and Jake is truly a ridiculous plot contrivance.<br />Unlike other readers, the unraveling of the Judaic customs and beliefs that accompanies every Lazarus story, for me, is a welcome counterpoint to the police line. The learnings and fabric this setting gives to the series helps it stand apart from all the others.<br />Three stars based on an interesting plot setting and Kellerman's writing style...but no more. I've recently given up reading Jonathan Kellerman, because recent entries in his Alex Delaware psychologist series have been pale shadows of his former work. Hopefully, that will not be the case with Faye's Lazarus series; it appears the author simply has to put in as much effort and creativity in the conclusions of her books as she does in the premise.	2001-09-24

She combines the elements of mystery with strong, contemporary characters, primarily women. Dialogue is crisp and honest, supporting characters fit the lifestyle of the heroine, and the story moves along so fast that you are disappointed you finished it so quickly! All of her heroines are feisty yet vulnerable, with an &quot;everywoman&quot; style, and generally a little &quot;long of tooth&quot;.<br />Judith Singer is no exception. Isaacs' first heroine, of &quot;Compromising Positions&quot; fame, is back some 20 years after she stumbled into her first murder and her first love affair. Played by Susan Sarandon(a perfect choice), in the movie of the same name, Judith is even more fascinating once her children are grown, her ambitions in the field of history fulfilled by her Phd., and her memories of Nelson Sharpe, the police lieutenant who won her heart 20 years ago.<br />Judith is urged to investigate a disappearance that looks like a murder by the father-in-law of the missing woman. &quot;Fancy Phil&quot; is a colorful, Jewish, &quot;retired&quot; mob man; good for many laughs and observations in the book. Judith's ability to spot the trend of &quot;coldness&quot; that runs in the life history of the missing woman<br />leads her to be able to solve the case, while assisting the police and fulfilling her obligation to Phil. Courtney, the missing/murdered heroine, is well drawn as a female who wants it all, and stops at nothing whenever she hits a brick wall, to proceed in another direction, no matter who she hurts. A great<br />villain and foil for the likeable Judith - another great read by Isaacs, my favorite author in today's fiction.<br />Enjoy, and read all the Isaacs novels, you will find a treasure trove of witty characters and tales!	2001-09-15

Greg Iles' use of the first person singular point of view in his novel, &quot;The Quiet Game&quot;, is a powerful tool to make the reader align himself with Penn Cage, an attorney and author who debuts as the hero of Iles novel of the south. Raised in Natchez, Mississippi and haunted by the death of his wife, Cage returns with his small daughter.  Life is not as simple as remembered, and Cage is drawn reluctantly (and by his ego!) into a complicated mystery that has remained unsolved for many years.<br />Too quickly, his family and friends are endangered by his probes into the coverup of what appears to be a civil rights murder of his childhood.  Cage keeps digging, formulating his own conclusions (sometimes wrong!) as he goes, and eventually bringing the misdeeds of the past to light.<br />Iles' prose will leave you breathless and will cause you to delay your chores while you get to the end of &quot;one more chapter&quot;...and then another and another.<br />4 stars instead of 5 when I so obviously enjoyed it?  Iles makes<br />the plot unnecessarily complex with one too many twists and turns.  For instance, the story could have survived and remained powerful without Olivia....but, small flaws notwithstanding, Iles novel will keep me going back for more of his writing.  Enjoy!	2001-09-05

My second read of &quot;Managers as Mentors&quot; leaves me even more satisfied and full of ideas and strategies than my reading of two years ago.  Chip Bell is a phenomenal speaker and author.  Just the time he spends and the guidance he gives in the prologue to this book will inspire managers who want to give back primarily by coaching and teaching.  Read the first time to give me insight in a new job assignment; working again with new managers and many youthful workers instead of the skilled team that I had had in the northeast, I wanted to inspire myself to be more than just a &quot;good boss&quot;.  I hope I have succeeded in making their work experience with me memorable, and, if I have, I owe a lot of my ability and willingness to guide and teach to the lessons I solidified by reading this book the first time.<br />This time, my division is planning to embark on a formal mentoring program.  The first five chapters and the SAGE principle will be my inspiration for the design of the introductory course, and we will utilize Bell's book in many ways as we move on through the test program for new managers and the final version for non-salaried employees to add to their personal growth, and perhaps become managers in turn.<br />It may be some time before institutions of higher learning catch on to the fact that teaching lifestyles skills such as mentoring is crucial, not only to the success of their graduates in the workforce, but also in helping them obtain some harmony, balance, and personal satisfaction in addition to honing their technical skills.  When they do, the competencies needed to succeed in a learning organization, and one that succeeds through building relationships to build productivity may find a home in undergraduate degrees of all kinds.  Until then it is critical that those of us in the workforce develop the emotional wisdom it takes to be a successful leader, and also to keep learning ourselves, from the new and unfamiliar experiences we gain from the people we supervise.<br />What a wonderful book to utilize in your own learning, or in your teaching (couple it with scenes from the movie &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; and you will have a powerful tool)...Bell's book not only sets the stage and expectations for a mentoring relationship, but gives practical advice, such as how to mentor around equipment, and a quiz to assess your mentoring skills.<br />One of today's most valuable business books...6 stars would not be enough!riences we gain from the people we supervise.<br />What a wonderful book to utilize in your own learning, or in your teaching (couple it with scenes from the movie &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; and you will have a powerful tool)...Bell's book not only sets the stage and expectations for a mentoring relationship, but gives practical advice, such as how to mentor around equipment, and a quiz to assess your mentoring skills.<BR>One of today's most valuable business books...6 stars would not be enough!	2001-09-05

If you are a fan of his prior series' featuring the sports hero Myron Bolitar, you will probably like this book, but be a little wistful at some of the missing elements as he changes genre. Bolitar is the hero of 7 prior novels that fall in the &quot;Comic Mystery Thriller&quot; category populated by Lawrence Sanders, Lawrence Block and Janet Evanovich. Characterizations in the Bolitar books are so over the top that they make you giggle, even as you are consumed in a pace so fast that you finish the book without taking time to get a snack. Conversation is witty and cynical and you wonder if the author was a stand up comedian in a prior life. When looking for a beach book or just a great read to get over the rest of the stress, Coben is a hero to most.<br />So, &quot;Tell No One&quot; is a big departure, and only Shauna, Tyrese &amp; Eric Wu, supporting characters in the story, will remind you that this is Coben. If you loved &quot;Tell No One&quot;, be prepared that you may find Coben's earlier books too light for your taste, if you believe a thriller is a thriller and any comic touches are just wasted words.<br />Only 2 things hold &quot;Tell No One&quot; back from a five star rating. Coben's hero, his weaving of a tale of romance and familial loyalty, his pace and his ability to leave you guessing as his plot twists and turns are terrific! His cops are believable and admirable and his hero spins in every direction when discovering how easily he has been duped about the murder of his wife and how he has incredibly passed 8 years since her murder in absolute ignorance.<br /> The 2 things: The final unveiling of the murderer was one twist too many...we could have left the tale much more enthusiastically without it. And, the dust jacket is horrific and looks as though a middle school child covered his English text in something his mom brought home. Small things. Tell No One might be the most exciting book you read this year!	2001-08-26
US	45979403	R1KNI9ED2BOESX	0399146245	897342569	24 Hours	Books	3	1	2	N	N	A good place for me to start...	I've been intrigued by the way Greg Iles keeps popping up in my peripheral vision, mostly on the Amazon site, but also forcing his way into my subconscious in bookstores and airports. So I decided to try his writing style with a book not as beloved as some of his earlier material, and go from there. I give &quot;24 Hours&quot; 3 stars, although for action and intensity, and the inability to put the book down, it probably deserves more.<br />An intriguing and complex kidnapping plot by a group of grifters who have perpetrated the crime before sets the stage in three locations as the race to save a child's life unfolds. Joey, Cheryl &amp; Huey, the band of kidnappers, realistically portray the number and type and psychology of most of those involved with acts of targeted violence for financial gain. Iles correctly captures the fear and willingness to take risk that all parents must feel when trying to save the life of their child. Will and Karen Jennings are accurately drawn as a wealthy physician couple , losing interest and faith in each other and staying together for their young daughter. Karen Jennings survives the novel as the most believable; facing the most dangerous of the kidnappers and willing to take risks she needs to take not only for her daughter but for her own soul. Iles increases the tension and keeps the reader stimulated throughout his novel.<br />Drawbacks include the larger than life rescue scene, the thought left that there will be a happier ever after for the Jennings' and the needless twist that ties Joey to this kidnapping for stakes larger than any of his previous crimes. To understand and believe in the character of Joey, it is important that the author would have kept the storyline to the thought that &quot;one crime is pretty much the same as another&quot; for a band of casual criminals. That said, I really enjoyed the pace &amp; characterization of the novel and hope to read more by Iles in coming weeks!	2001-08-26

Continuing my love affair with the works of Margaret Maron, I returned to her Deborah Knott series and really enjoyed &quot;Uncommon Clay&quot;, which is a quick read with an ending that surprised me.<br />Deb is again on the road, visiting Asheboro this time, and the reader gets the treat of learning more about NC folk crafts...(prior novels have featured furniture), this time with the work of Carolina's folk pottery industry.  Some interesting and colorful new characters and friends are added to the story line. The book also continues the saga of Deb's romances, and how badly they go sometimes.  In this tale, Deb has two embarrassing  scrapes with the down side of relationships.  Maron also takes the time to insert a small tidbit about Oscar Nauman, a character from her Sigrid Harald series, in a way that makes the reference seem real and natural.<br />With its interesting plots, spunky heroine, delightful descriptions of large southern families and friends, and its ability to educate the reader on the life and times of beautiful NC, the Knott series is a fast, entertaining, and well written group of books.  Uncommon Clay still leaves me hungry for more!	2001-07-30

His research and imagination make you wonder at just how much of the conceptual work with the brain used as the centerpiece of his story is real, and already being pursued, and how much is fantasy.  Nat Hennessey and Cush Walker are well-drawn characters on both sides of an issue, with hidden, bloody secrets in their past and equally in love with the same woman.  The intricate plot of &quot;A Slow Burning&quot;, in telling their separate stories, along with that of Camilla, and visiting in flashbacks, scenes from their past keeps you consumed and reading long past bedtime.<br />The novel did not bog down for me, as is reported by other reviewers, in the middle, and continued to move along at breakneck speed to a really successful conclusion.  I give only four stars because the brutality in several of the scenes was too horrific, and the villain, JJ Jackson, was much larger than life.<br />The &quot;race card&quot; played out in two ways with each of the heroes, added, rather than detracted from the texture of the book for me, and I certainly will take the time to find and enjoy &quot;The Fourth Procedure&quot;, Pottinger's first novel.<br />A great read for fans of the medical thriller genre, but also for those who enjoy a solid mystery and crime story!	2001-07-22

The ending has a twist, because not all of the guilty are made to pay.<br />There is some good character support to supplant the missing Hawk (Spenser stories are never as good without Hawk!) in the form of Deputy Sheriff Becker and Tedy Sapp, a gay bouncer who Spenser befriends in his latest out of state foray, this time to Georgia.  The Clive family is drawn too broadly as goofy, indulgent southerners, but all in all, the novel moves fast and  a middle of the road Spenser novel is usually more entertaining than much of the other detective genre.<br />Read on a road trip...it will keep you entertained!	2001-07-22

Picture someone in midlife who drifts to Florida when his wife dies; and puts together a very simplistic lifestyle in one of Florida's wealthiest communities.  You get a great look at Sarasota from the back of a Dairy Queen!  You get a hero with a real sense of humor and a knack with people who is masquerading as a process server.  You get a strong set of supporting characters, particularly in Flo, Sally, Ames and the fascinating Harvey, a computer research maven and Dr. Ann Horowitz, Lew's elderly psychiatrist.<br />In &quot;Vengeance&quot;, the first time we get together with Lew (a Stanley Tucci lookalike), Kaminsky has woven together two different mysteries, one of which is exceedingly difficult to figure out.  The characters are more carefully drawn and the romance is soft and believable.  Fonesca is someone could very probably have met in your own lifetime, and his unassuming habits and thoughts are in sharp contrast to his quick wit and humor...  A tidbit...<br />&quot;I'm gay, Mr. Fonesca.  I told you.&quot; &quot;Why do they call it gay?  Most of the homosexuals I've known are smiling on the outside and depressed on the inside&quot;, I said. &quot;Like you?&quot; &quot;There is a distinct similarity&quot;, I said, sinking back into the chair.<br />A great and breezy read; makes you want Kaminsky to keep returning to Lew in the future!	2001-07-22

Who the killer is, kept me guessing until it was revealed in the last chapter.<br />Oscar Nauman plays only a bit part here, and Maron also fades out  Tillie, to some extent.  The danger to Harald's life, as the murderer is revealed is well drawn and the action scene is memorable.<br />Past Imperfect showcases all Maron's skills and successfully fills in several gaps in Harald's life.  Truly a fine novel, that will hopefully be available in a reprinted version in the near future.	2001-07-22

There is no question in the reader's mind that Alex did not murder his neighbor, Gus Marchand, a man who hides his bigotry and small-mindedness behind the cloak of his religion.  Because of Alex's strange appearance and history, however, the law enforcement agency and the townspeople of Opal Creek, Oregon persecute and prosecute him for the crime.<br />Barbara Holloway and her father Frank find themselves in an adversarial position on the crime.  Barbara's secret client is Alex, and Frank is trying to protect an old friend, who is subsequently murdered in the second of two mysteries, from being accused of the crime.<br />The events and conflict leading up to the courtroom confrontation are merely a canvas for the excellent and crisp writing that Wilhelm uses to portray the courtroom battle.  Before it is over, Kate and Frank have joined forces, and the ending is much more satisfactory than a not guilty verdict would have been.<br />Wilhelm commands and holds your interest, without gratuitous sex or violence in her novels.  Her main character, Barbara Holloway, is a gutsy, intelligent, and articulate attorney.  Wilhelm never fails to surround her with an equally interesting cast.<br />Desperate Measures is an excellent read that keeps you guessing and successfully weaves a double mystery plot.

I've had just such a wish with Margaret Maron's first series, the Sigrid Harald &quot;cop&quot; series, set in New York City. Sigrid's a bit of a loner, who starts to find her true self after she makes Lieutenant in a midtown squad. The first 4 books in the series are all worth reading (Start with &quot;One Coffee With&quot;, &quot;Death of a Butterfly&quot;, &quot;Death in Blue Folders&quot; and &quot;The Right Jack&quot;) and lead up to &quot;Baby Doll Games&quot;, in which Maron uses the literary trick of slipping inside a minor character's part (the child psychologist) to give the reader some thought-provoking clues as to how the story will end. The major theme, the death of a compelling young dancer, will hold your interest, but it is the minor mystery, about two youngsters, that provides the incredible plot twist and ending. This book also dives in more thoroughly to the totally goofy Roman Tramegra, who gives Harald's asetic home life some warmth and style. Possibly the best book in this series, although my personal favorite comes along in 7th position...&quot;Past Imperfect&quot;. Maron delivers no matter if her heroine is Harald, or the decidedly more feminine Deborah Knotts. Enjoy!	2001-07-22

What a treat to have Steph's dysfunctional sister and her two scary nieces to thicken the stew of crazies that populate this series!<br />Just when you think it is safe to be on the road again, Steph starts driving a motorcycle.  And, the thought of her transporting &quot;human&quot; organs around in order to ransom her grandma tells you that Evanovich must stay awake at night to top the last book in the series with outrageous scenes.<br />I confess, I want it to be Morelli, but I'm OK with still having a love triangle carry us from book to book.  But the best, oh yes, are the scenes at the Plum's dinner table, where Mom &amp; Dad are constantly reeling from the things they learn from the various members of the family over pot roast.  &quot;Just kill me now&quot;, each of them contributes when they learn of the newest craziness from Grandma, Steph, and now Valerie.<br />Not in the least stale, but perhaps Evanovich has to expand her horizons a little more....(Stephanie visits California?), while always returning to the &quot;burg&quot;.  Great read!<br />Postscript:  I have all 7 of the novels, but can never lay my hands on more than one, because I'm in a constant state of &quot;lend&quot; to friends.

I liked the whole idea of Tommy Hevener (time for a new romance, younger guy, good chemistry) so the twist that Grafton adds to make him a bad guy was unexpected and added to the plot.<br />I do agree with many of the other reviewers that the plotting of &quot;P&quot; is a little light and Kinsey isn't at her best when she's not really interested in what she is doing.  I liked some of the new characters - particularly Anica &amp; Mariah Talbot (Sue G...perhaps a break to make one of them the heroine of a book not in the series?)  I always appreciate more of Henry, but not enough of Sue's other usual regulars in the cast.  Finally, I liked the guessing game you can play with the ending, although I'm a creature of habit &amp; missed the &quot;respectfully submitted...&quot; piece.<br />Still looking forward to &quot;Q&quot; and glad that Grafton has kept Kinsey alive, well, and cynical as ever!	2001-07-01

This time Rhyme is out of his element in North Carolina, where he gets sidetracked from important surgery by a kidnapping case he is asked to investigate.<br />Thom and Sachs are back assisting him, and their characterizations are solid, although the plot twist involving Sachs and the kidnapper is implausible.  Featured in the story is the North Carolina countryside, in all its beauty, and an interesting local character, Lucy Kerr.  Like Rhyme himeself, Lucy has been crippled by physical devastation, but keeps going in the law enforcement world, while costing herself a lot of personal pain.  Deaver might do well to feature her in an upcoming book; there is a lot to explore in her character.<br />Weaving the psychological practice of &quot;the empty chair&quot; into the book is an interesting sidebar to the central plot, and the true villains are surprising and revealed only at the end.  In the meantime, you keep turning the pages and getting more deeply involved into the search for the kidnap victim and the thought processes that keep Rhyme and Sachs motivated.<br />A good read by a strong author with one of the more interesting heroes in mystery novels today.	2001-06-20

New Mexico itself also plays a strong role in the novel, and McGarrity's view and visuals of the southwest continue to provide a successful backdrop.<br /> No, here the story breaks down with the eventual discovery of the reasons for the terrible crime, and how they center upon a depraved judge, of whom little evil is known until his death. Generally, those as unsympathetic as Judge Vernon Langsford are known to their surroundings as evil, long before their death. In the book, it takes Kerney quite some time to unearth his secrets, even though it is obvious from the beginning that there are a lot of things that are &quot;not quite right&quot; about his lifestyle.<br />Still, the book moves at a rapid pace and has an interesting new insight into Kerney, when an unknown family is revealed to him. His reactions and conduct make him continue to be a favorite hero in suspense and mystery novels.<br />Worth the read!	2001-06-20

Thanks to the success of her newest series, featuring Olivia Brown (Free Love, Murder Me Now), the publishing world has rediscovered Annette Meyers and is reissuing her classing Wall St. series - the &quot;Smith &amp; Wetzon&quot; books.<br />The Big Killing, the first in this series, and arguably the best, was first printed in 1989 and led the way for a view into the fast-paced, self indulgent world of wall street traders and the executives who &quot;headhunt&quot; them for New York firms.  Meyers inserts her personal knowledge of Wall St. and couples it with her fascination and experience in musical theatre.  Both Wall St. and Broadway are caricature settings for excessive behaviors, and you will find a lot of caricature characters in Meyers' series. Leading the way is Xenia Smith (a quote:  &quot;It's about money, it's always about money&quot;), partner in executive search with Leslie Wetzon, a former Broadway dancer.  Smith is amusing and always entertaining, with her series of rich paramours and her need to stick her nose into everyone's business, especially Wetzon's.<br /> More finely drawn are the characters of Wetzon, Silvestri (think George Clooney in need of a shave) and Carlos Prince, who can literally jump off the pages of these books.  New York city sights also play a starring role, and Meyers delights in refamiliarizing those of us no longer in the city with descriptions of local landmarks that make the books come alive.  My favorite?  Steven Sondheim's residence, at which Wetzon always pays homage by the tip of a beret.<br />The Big Killing starts off with a &quot;bang&quot;, as Barry Stark, eager to jump to another firm, gets killed at the site of a clandestine meeting with Wetzon.  Shocked by the incident, Wetzon gets drawn deeper and deeper into the mystery, which stays a mystery until the final pages of the novel.  Readers will be moved by the need and the caring that is generated by the Wetzon-Silvestri relationship, no matter how many times Wetzon gets involved with another man.<br />Read the Big Killing, and then enjoy the rest of the series (starting with &quot;Tender Death&quot;) as they are released again for new fans of this interesting author.

Or, utilize its message just as a brief &quot;chapter read&quot; to jump start the positive if you are not looking for a lifelong habit.<br />It is very difficult to express, in words, the inner activities that result in becoming comfortable in your own skin.  Kabat-Zinn writes thoughtfully and honestly about how he has accomplished this, and what things might work for you.  There are many treasures in this book.  For me, his ability to describe the rewards one gets from practiced patience, and to impress upon the reader the simplicity of the &quot;body scan&quot; and how it can lead to the habit of lying down meditation are two examples of things that readers can take away at any given time from his book.<br />Many self-help readers today are looking for the &quot;quick fix&quot; or some small coping practice they can employ to keep their days positive. In some ways, in addition to helping you understand why meditation works and why it can change your life, Kabat-Zinn writes a poetic and illuminating version of the &quot;one minute help&quot; chapters that the &quot;Don't Sweat the Small Stuff&quot; series provided to these readers in the busy working world.<br />When you couple his vision and ideas with the lovely verse that liberally sprinkles his book (Kabir, Thoreau and Whitman are favorites) you have a quiet and inspirational message that can do more to help you understand and eliminate your stress than can all the meditation, control and organizational techniques advocated in today's America could ever do.<br />Read &quot;Wherever you go, there you are&quot; and learn how mindfulness can change the course of your daily life for the better.  It works.ou go, there you are&quot; and learn how mindfulness can change the course of your daily life for the better.  It works.	2001-06-08

And maybe &quot;pretty OK&quot; for a first novel.  There's enough of interest in here to make me want to continue with at least one more book, but, I tend to agree with &quot;a reader from San Antonio&quot; (see review following mine), that there is a lot to be desired in plot and writing style.  Rough around the edges; let's see if he can develop the characters better in the next go round!	2001-05-25

Susan Jane Gilman has her way with us!<br /> With tongue in cheek, she says all the things we say (that's the fairer sex) when we are out with girlfriends drinking margaritas (I date myself, if I were under 35, it would be cosmopolitans!).  It is, and I quote, &quot;her intention to offer women inspiration, wit and tools for intelligent resistance&quot;..... to all the wacky things we are supposed to be and think and do because.... we are broads.<br />She inspires us while giving us inside information to philosophy passed down from her old grandma.  Most of the inspiration and grandma's sayings far surpass the advice you will get from the &quot;health and well being&quot; or &quot;feminist&quot; magazines that exist today.<br />Here are my favorite takeaways from the book, in no particular order:<br />1.The term &quot;Smartmouth Goddess&quot; (SG) - what we all would like to be.  We ARE SG's, deep in our inner thoughts, but our need to &quot;build relationships&quot; keeps us from spewing.<br />2.  Advice on friends:  &quot;Friends shouldn't be treated as leftovers&quot;.<br />3.  Advice on good habits to adopt from men:  &quot;Men do not schlepp.&quot;<br />3.  Advice on family: &quot;Regard your family as a source of popular entertainment- distance yourself from their neuroses by pretending they're on television&quot;.<br />Gilman combines her knack for turning a phrase and cynical humor with a little political agenda, sex and Biblical references thrown in for good measure.<br />Read it when your husband is out of town!	2001-05-25
US	45979403	R1K3JTCF3VYRZE	0399147284	853678814	Chosen Prey	Books	5	5	7	N	Y	You will race through this book....	because you won't be able to put it down! Mystery and crime masters are those who can continue to expand and entertain with the same characters over a long period of time and a lot of novels.  Eventually, like great television shows, there are no plots left to explore.  Sandford should be nearing this point, but you will be just as enthusiastic with his twelfth novel as you were with his first! Choosing to reveal his villain early on in the novel, Sandford spends enormous time developing him in three dimensions.  You are caught up in how close the police come to him and how you can spot clues before they know they are clues.  His normal group of characters is back, and as strong as ever, and the Davenport &quot;womanizing&quot; angle is given a new twist with his &quot;taming&quot; and rekindling of his relationship with Weather.<br />I read this novel in 6 hours and wished I could read while driving the car, so I didn't have to interrupt it.  A great tale by one of the most engaging mystery/crime writers today!  Enjoy...	2001-05-18
US	45979403	R1R0GUL0NI8CKW	0394561619	702863006	Love in the Time of Cholera	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	Marquez soars....	with a beautiful tale of love in South America at the turn of the century.  All three of its main characters are succinctly drawn, and the reader can feel the process of aging and the changing of feelings and expectations as we proceed through the seasons of life.  Minor characters that surround the love triangle are colorful and woven with great care into the story.  Marquez must have known great loves and sustaining loves in his life to have captured all of its flavors here.  With a truly satisfying ending, and historical reality threaded throughout the human experience, this is a great book of the 20th century. Read it as soon as you can; it is a treasure.	2001-05-13
US	45979403	R1K72YNYX8F6NB	0394568540	747001404	Death of a Jewish American Princess: The True Story of a Victim on Trial	Books	4	23	23	N	N	Trying  to make sense out of the senselessness....	is what Shirley Frondorf does in her &quot;after the fact&quot; narrative of the famous Steinberg trial in Scottsdale, Arizona.  Along the way, she gives those of us who have visited or lived in Scottsdale a good feel for what it was like in the '70's.  The book appears to be an accurate accounting of what can happen when the victim is put on trial in criminal court and the prosecutor underestimates the defense. Although that is the primary reason for Steinberg going free from his brutal crime, Frondorf accurately describes all the lucky coincidences that fell into place in this miscarriage of justice. I can only imagine what it must be like to be one of the &quot;players&quot; in this story to review the events as detailed in the book.  The shame and denial that must take place for the defense witnesses and the officers of the court that allowed such a farcical outcome are too hard to imagine.  An interesting read regarding small town justice, compulsive gambling, and complete with some human interest pictures from the events, the &quot;Dof a JAP&quot; will hold your interest and make you wonder for years to come.	2001-04-24
US	45979403	R1A44366KCFBVY	0425178579	127101612	Betrayal in Death	Books	4	6	7	N	Y	Yes, I read J.D. Robb...	and no, I'm not a big fan of romance novels.  Generally I am more interested in suspense or police procedurals.  Nora Roberts, (writing as JDR) gives us all 3 in her Eve Dallas series, with her 12th book.  In the series, she takes a look at the police department of the future, and combines its strong Lieutenant with an interesting and wealthy husband, Roarke. None of Eve's adversaries are common criminals; the series focuses on brutal crime.  All of the surrounding characters, whether ongoing (Peabody, Feeney, Summerset, McNab) or one-time visitors, (Mick, Roarke's boyhood friend) are well-drawn.  The humor is light and welcome, the scenes between Roarke/Eve and McNab/Peabody are erotic.<br />Like the rest of the series, I read the book in one sitting and really enjoyed myself.  One critique is that I would have liked to see more characterization and a better ending for the villain, Yost, who had future potential for the series. Other than that detail, I thoroughly enjoyed the outing and the character development and encourage readers to read the series from the first book, &quot;Naked in Death&quot;.  You'll have a great read!	2001-04-24
US	45979403	R1AWI4T8735LDN	0688170528	990695172	The Pact: A Love Story	Books	5	15	19	N	Y	I was mesmerized by this story.	Jodi Picoult writes a compelling and beautifully paced novel of love and angst, a tale that mixes the lives of  4 adults and 3 children with a satisfying lifestyle, who can't believe or find peace with the traumatic events created by suicide within their circle.<br />The characters are well drawn and sympathetic, and Picoult's writing style, which moves from current day events back to the past and weaves the story to its roots, wins the reader over immediately.  It's a particularly well drawn account of what happens to a young person imprisoned for a long period of time while the justice system slowly moves through its motions - Chris is the character that centers the book, and grows and changes through the aftermath of suicide, although Emily, with all her flaws, is the heart of the story.<br />I generally read thrillers &amp; mysteries and took a break from them with this book.  I was rewarded with a rich reading experience and a book I will cherish for a long time and recommend to friends.<br />Moms &amp; Dads - please read the book.  There are so many clues to what can happen to your teens without you being aware....if something similar has happened to your family, &quot;The Pact&quot; will give you comfort.  If it has not, it will make you more self-aware of the dynamics of your family, and how you may need to examine and change them as your children grow.	2001-04-15
US	45979403	R2D7T4TRTVK2D8	0738830658	343343222	The Crowning Circle	Books	4	4	5	N	N	J. R. Lankford has succeeded with her first novel,...	a compelling thriller that combines well-drawn police procedural with technology and thorough characterization.  If the Crowning Circle is any indication, she will be successful in her future career, and, like the other reviewers, I would like to see her continue the theme and characters developed in this book.<br />There are some flaws that reduce the book to 4 stars - I found the nature of the villain's obsession a little far-fetched, and was a little disappointed at the transient loyalties of Skeet and Shirley; they gave up on their friends and lovers too easily.<br />Other than those &quot;wrinkles&quot;, I had a difficult time putting the book down and am especially drawn to Jake, one of the two lead characters.  Lankford has mixed elements of thrill writing found in Connelly &amp; Sandford with characters who drive their actions through loyalty and love.<br />A great read!  Buy the book!  J.R., please keep them coming!	2001-04-15
US	45979403	R2B0R4V2PS8UJJ	0385499035	515648474	The Program	Books	5	5	6	N	Y	The protected become the hunted...	so begins the profile of this book on its jacket.  And, throughout his newest novel, Stephen White capitalizes on this theme.<br />The 9th book in his series about Boulder psychologist Alan Gregory, leaves no room for doubt that White can be a masterful storyteller, even with Gregory playing a supporting role.<br />Many of the prior reviewers have captured the essence of the storyline, although I found it difficult to put down throughout the course of the novel.  White experiments successfully with different narrarators throughout the book, adding to the experience of the novel, rather than detracting from it, in the hands of a less skilled writer.  He also gets yet another opportunity to explore one of his quirky passions, the Witness Protection program, in depth.  Past White novels have allowed us to learn and explore more about the sport of cycling, the Church of the Latter Day Saints, the condition of multiple sclerosis, etc., while the mystery  plotline evolves around his willingness to share knowledge on a variety of topics.  I think that is what makes him a favorite of many devoted readers, and reminds me of the early books of Jonathan Kellerman.<br />In particular, Lauren Crowder, wife of Gregory, remains a compelling yet flawed character, enhanced in this book even though she has only a minor role.<br />The real stars are Kirsten Lord, and Carl Luppo.  Luppo is pretty well drawn, but the dialogue in therapy between Gregory and Lord is outstanding, and the time spent evolving the &quot;whales&quot; terminology that Lord uses is just as interesting as the revelation of her status as a totally dependent woman, a surprise to both her and to the reader.<br />Just an outstanding read, and a book to treasure.  Can be enjoyed without reading the first 8 novels, but you must go back and explore them as well!	2001-04-11
US	45979403	R24SE5Z22KBFCO	1551667940	299429989	Bone Cold	Books	4	17	22	N	Y	An Entertaining Read!!	Erica Spindler has written a fast-paced, enjoyable thriller with a several &quot;neat&quot; plot twists!<br />One of the factors that adds to the charm of the book is the New Orleans setting.  The reader is encouraged to take note of what are some of the author's obviously favorite haunts in the city.  An added bonus is that it makes me want to go back to the Big Easy and make sure to see the sites as she sees them.<br />Anna North is an engaging heroine, easy to believe in.  It is evident why the cast of supporting players in the novel is attracted to her circle.  The events are thrilling, and it is difficult to put the book down once you have gotten past the first few chapters.  There is a dual storyline involving Quentin Malone's partner that takes away some enjoyment from the book, but overall, I'm thrilled that I found Erica Spindler, and grateful to Amazon reviewers, who led me to this discovery. I'm looking forward to reading some of her past work, and &quot;Bone Cold&quot; (bad title) will have a permanent place on my paperback book shelf.<br />Read &quot;Bone Cold&quot; for a fast-paced look into a psychological mystery!	2001-04-04

I thought that the newest would delve deeper into his main character, Julian, and set the stage for a good series.<br />Well, it was a fast and interesting read, but it did not live up to my expectations in character development, nor did it tell a very good story.  Stone has talent, and it will be interesting to see if he can develop it, or if he just writes more of this type to sell to beach readers &amp; airport browsers.  I hope not.<br />The newest relationship between Julian &amp; Bear is implausible.  The search, by Bear, for Julian's past just detracts from the Ryan murder, which could have been an excellent mystery on its own.  Mr. Stone's &quot;choppy&quot; writing style does not bother me, as it does some of the early reviewers; in fact, I enjoy the way his mind jumps around on the page, but hope he will not use his writing methodology to plot jump again.<br />If Stone publishes a third, I will buy &amp; try to read it...but he only has one more chance with me!	2001-03-25

Anne Wingate, writing as Lee Martin, has a little known and much beloved series of police procedurals with one of the most interesting heroines in women's mysteries.<br />Although the Thursday Club is not one of the top books in the series (it is #13), it holds your interest, keeps you guessing, and leaves off with still another twist &amp; turn in the family life of Deb Ralston.<br />Please, Lee....bring her back for more!	2001-03-22

Kenzie/Gennaro are two of my favorites in the mystery genre, but I enjoy it when authors who have more to offer than just one stream of thought are brave enough to depart from their own mainstream.<br />Lehane does not disappoint, and I could not put the book down - went to work 45 minutes late as a result....<br />Looking at the incredibly versatile group of &quot;customer reviewers&quot; who have already echoed my own thoughts, I would just say that Lehane tells a stark story of lives wrapped together in  such a way, that a collision is unescapable.  Although the same suspense that follows his mystery series is present, I believe that Lehane has gone beyond the boundaries of mystery into the early waters of 21st century literature.  Jimmy &amp; Annabeth Marcus are unforgettable, the supporting characters believable and complex.. a great read!	2001-03-22

In his newest, Dunning crafts a story of a writer, caught up in a mystery due to a lost love.  Stumbling through America in the war years, he manages to find a way to bring the truth to life, but along the way he finds himself in the broadcast radio game, and it is there that his talent truly comes alive.  Dunning tops the story off with a coda that leaves the reader guessing as to whom Jack/Jordan finally spends the rest of his life with.<br />I haven't given up on the return of Cliff Janeway, the &quot;Bookman&quot; and hope that Dunning will return to his hero in the future, but &quot;Two O'Clock Eastern Wartime&quot; is an outstanding read.<br />Remembering my parents &amp; grandparents talking about sitting around the radio for hours to listen, learn and be entertained, I always wondered about the attraction - Dunning has helped put that in perspective by giving the reader a sense of the magic that was radio during the war years in the 30's and 40's.  Obviously an expert on the topic, he wraps his knowledge around a well written mystery with a hero you can really care about and an interesting cast of bit players.<br />I am a mystery/thriller buff, and don't often come across truly great writing - the thrill is the mystery itself, the element of surprise and sometimes disaster. Dunning can do it all.  He can share a mystery with his readers but the quality of his own writer's craftsmanship appears throughout the novel, and makes it come alive...&quot;He dreamed that there was no war.  Got up at three and exploded into his work, as if the answer to everything lay in some unwritten script still hidden away in his mind...&quot;; Dunning captures the thrill and the fulfillment of being a great writer and shares it with all of us who have never known that rush.<br /> Please read &quot;Two O'clock Eastern Wartime&quot;, you will have no regrets.	2001-03-10

I had made up my mind not to buy or read this one, but a few of the Amazon reviews caused me to change my mind, and waste my time. Implausible?  You bet.  Attraction between Michael &amp; Nora...why? They are the two least likely characters on the planet to connect so deeply.  And if political machinations and drugs aren't enough for you, we can always throw in incest.  Sorry, Brad, you are off my reading list!	2001-02-21
US	45979403	R7ZRS3QKV0B7G	0316154075	347427189	A Darkness More Than Night	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Almost 5 stars...Connelly continues to grab me!	I agree with other reviewers, that, to appreciate Connelly, you need to go back to the beginning &amp; read his books in order.  For airport shop readers, that's not good news, but if you consume books like wildfire, you're always looking for a series to last you a few weeks.<br />Both Harry Bosch &amp; Terry McCaleb return in this novel, and although it is great to have Terry back, it is truly Harry Bosch that withstands the test of Connelly's skill in developing a character.  We see Harry at his most poised, in the courtroom, and at his most influential - when he turns the tide for McCaleb and sets the two of them on a path to resolve the newest crimes to dot the much maligned LA landscape. The tie in to Harry's namesake, the frightening artist Bosch, is worthy of Michael Crichton.  In concluding the book, the reader realizes that it has not been a great &quot;mystery&quot; just a fully absorbing read of profiling and the constant rollercoaster changes that arise in solving a crime.<br />Personally, I know that I've had a great read when I walk around the house all evening, from task to task, carrying the book with my finger in the place I stopped - so I can gulp a few more paragraphs between tasks.  In this, &quot;Darkness&quot; did not disappoint, and Connelly keeps me looking forward to his next plot invention.	2001-02-21

Love reading him; easy, escapist fiction, great characters (for the most part) and books are hard to put down.<br />This book is different - like other reviewers, it took me over a week to read, and usually I find enough spare moments to finish in 48-60 hours.  If it takes longer, it probably didn't hold my interest.<br />Excellent weaving of several plots together, but there is way too much &quot;goodness&quot; in the book.  The heroes and heroines have very few, if any, flaws and so their characters are relatively uninteresting.<br />Junior Cain, the villain, becomes a bumbler before the book ends, but Koontz gives us interesting insight into the mind of those depraved enough to kill their loved ones and commit the brutal act of rape.  By completely misreading everyone's reaction to him, and attributing false motivation to his victims (e.g., he falsely believes the women he attacks are interested in him and giving him &quot;come hither&quot; signs), the Cain character helped me to really think about how a brutal person thinks.  So, Dean, congratulations on the villain, but please, don't bring the story back....go to another stream of thought and work as hard on the characters as you did on Cain!	2001-02-18
