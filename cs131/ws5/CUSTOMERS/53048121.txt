In this collection of his `Carlucci' novels he shows why he is also a first rate writer of mysteries. He deftly combines the genre in a manner so that readers of either SciFi or Mystery will be satisfied. I recommend these in this volume or individually. There is enough difference to interest anyone. <br /> <br />My major comment and the reason for my title is the really glum, despondent, morose . . .I think of run out of synonyms here. Ruso really paints a bleak and scary picture of the close future. I remember a article I think Ray Bradbury wrote years ago. He said that on days when he felt especially good, he'd write a quick dismal story just to get all traces of depression out of his system. Maybe that is what Ruso is doing here. Although most of them of a quick nod to emotional uplift at the end, they are, for the most part really bleak views of the world.  <br /> <br />Don't let that turn you off unless you are a perpetual Pollyanna; we all need a dose of the blues from time to time. <br />	2005-08-28

The author is a friend of mine, so I didn't want to just heap praise on him because of that. I read the book and really liked it, but I also bought a couple of copies of the book and gave it to some experts in the field of fiction for young adults. Here are their comments. <br /> <br />\\"So, the book was very good.  I liked all of the pictures in it, because they gave you a good idea of where the book was taking place.  Out of both the books, I liked the first one more, because it was very exciting.  I also liked how the people that Tina meets in the book come back at all different times.  The other book was also good, because I talked about all of these different places, so you could learn about certain buildings, and other places.  You really have to take your time when reading this book to comprehend all of the information. I would definitely recommend this book to my friends, and family.  -Angie (age 12).\\" <br /> <br /> \\"I thought the book was definitely a page turner. It made you wonder what was going to happen next. It was also very descriptive about the setting of the book. I also thought that Tina was like an average girl except for the fact that she goes on amazing adventures. I enjoyed the book very much. I think it's very realistic. - Chelsey (Age 13).\\" <br /> <br />	2005-06-01

Walter Mosley is best known for his `Easy Rawlins' series, and often overlooked as a wonderful writer of really experimental fiction. For example `Futureland' and `Blue Light' are first rate SciFi, but certainly off the beaten track. In this book Mosley explores a number of dark issues, most notably self condemnation and the need for retribution. The protagonist in the novel struggles with some traditional problems; alcoholism and sloth, but also with an identity crisis as an African American who does not share a family history tied to slavery. `The Man in the Basement' is not SciFi or a `mystery' in the normal sense, but readers of both these genres will recognize themes here. I found this a wonderful book and the only reason I give it four instead of five stars is that I felt Mosley backed off a bit at the end. Just my opinion however.	2005-04-20

The basic plot here is whether or not there is evil in the universe. There is, although just what is the nature of this evil remains a bit of a mystery. The book keep me interested from beginning to end and made me think a lot along the way. Russo makes no attempt to explain the exact situation, but simply takes you along for the ride. This is the first time I've read this author, but I'm looking forward to getting some of his other books. Excellent! I guess the only reason I'm giving this 4 instead of 5 stars is that the ending sort of left me a bit cold; I would have preferred a more definitive end.	2005-04-15

It is amazing what a best seller can do for an author's previous efforts. Dan Brown has managed to turn `The De Vinci Code' into a vehicle for his other works. `Digital Fortress' is bad, bad, bad. It is a stupid plot; for example the National Security Agency, the most secret, secure, agency in US government hires a convicted felon with a record of security violations to work in the crypto center because he busted and exposed an NSA effort to tap emails! The story is supposed to be two simultaneous plots; one in Washington D.C., one in Italy. But the point of view is all screwed up. The story line in DC takes hours that in Italy takes days. And that ain't the worst! At the Climax of the book someone announces there are 3 minutes left until the end of civilization as we know it. This is followed by 10 minutes of action! Then 2 minutes! followed by 5 minutes of action. 1 minute! 5 more minutes of action! Is that all? No! 30 seconds! more action, 15 seconds! more action, 3 seconds! followed by at least 5 minutes of action! I'm not kidding! Doesn't this guy, or his editors, own a watch? There are entire chapters about two characters opening a door! And to top everything off, the book is suppose to be about codes, but it seems Brown doesn't know the difference between a code and a riddle! It is a riddle that solves the entire boring mess. The book, and Audio CD which I listened to, is boring and badly written and I strongly urge you to avoid buying this junk.	2005-04-12

When I began my career in Wildlife Management over 30 years ago I was surprised at how many people quoted this work, but admitted they had not actually read it. I had read it in graduate school and was amazed at how prescient Leopold had been. He accurately predicted where Wildlife Management would go in the future and what would be necessary for success. (As a side note, Leopold used the two word term `Wild Life' meaning plants, animals, the soil; i.e. ecosystems. The term was changed to one word by the Wisconsin Legislature and defined as certain animals only.)    While this book is technical, it is not obtuse or wordy. It follows in the easily read style of Leopold and is worth the time and money of non-professionals as well as professionals. To the latter, wildlife management professionals however, I especially recommend reading this work. It will hold surprises for even those who think they \\"know\\" what Leopold had to say.    One more aside; Leopold had little use for political intervention and organizational concerns as is displayed by the fact that he devotes only a few sparse pages to organizational issues in this book. It is, in my opinion, unfortunate that Leopold did not turn his incredible intellect, wit, and writing abilities to this topic as it is, in truth, of more importance in the management of natural resources than the scientific issues.    This book is a classic in the field and deserves to be read as much as \\"A Sand County Almanac.\\" I strongly recommend it.	2005-02-18

Books	4	24	31	N	Y	Good, But One Sided	This book is NOT about economics and the environment. It IS about the up-side of using property rights and free-market capitalism to resolve conflicts with environmental regulation. The book (actually a very long essay) is very well written, but it only presents one side of this debate; nothing wrong with that, everyone does it, but in this case it should be more clearly stated. For every example of where property rights and free-market environmentalism have worked, there are examples of where they didn't. PERC is not in the business however of presenting both sides, again; nothing wrong with that. However if you are looking for a book about the general considerations of economics and the environment, Try Bionomics: Economy As Ecosystem by Michael Rothschild or For the Common Good : Redirecting the Economy toward Community, the Environment, and a Sustainable Future by Herman E. Daly. While both of these may be as biased to the other side of the issue, although I'm not sure what \\"the other side\\" is, they are much more about the use of economic theory to understand conflict resolution in environmental disputes.	2004-05-26

The author is a professional guide in the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve and as such is knowledgeable about a wide variety of natural history subjects. This book is primarily a review of the literature about mammals in not only Costa Rica, but elsewhere in Central America. It contains information widely applicable to other counties and the suggestions for conservation apply just as widely.<br />I have a pretty good library on wildlife in Central and South America and this beautifully done book is probably the best, not only about a specific group, but also about general issues. The drawings are excellent, the overall book is well put together and, the writing is clear, simple, accurate, and really first-rate. Buy this book even if you don't plan on traveling to Costa Rica.	2004-05-22

The government should immediately construct a time-status machine and put Richard Powers in it so that he can continue writing novels for eternity. Every time I read one of his novels I come away almost speechless. As a result I limit myself to one of them every 3 or 4 years; otherwise I'd be mute. <br />Powers takes on the issue of race in the United States in his novel. He uses music and time theory as two ways to advance the plot. If you think the three issues are unrelated, just hold on, Powers makes the case and seals it shut. <br />The enigmatic message of the white, Jewish father to his black, estranged daughter says a lot about this novel: \\"No matter where you point your telescope, there is a different wavelength.\\" (I hope I got that right, I gave my copy of the book to a friend). <br />I can't say how much I admire this novel.

Most of them are of interest to those who study European politics and cultural life. If you are not interested in the Italian press or post WWII Facism in Europe and are not familiar with some of the well known players, parts of these essays will make no sense to you. <br />However, the first essay, \\"Reflections on War,\\" is worth the price. This essay was written about the first \\"gulf\\" war in Kuwait. Reading in now in a post-Iraq war frame is even more interesting. Eco predicts the neo-conservative view that active imposition of democracy by the developed nations will begin to occur in the middle east and elsewhere and he gives some brillant insight into this thinking.<br />The other essays have thoughts worth reading even if the topics are not your cup of tea. Like all of Eco's work, this is highly readable and not at all obtuse.	2003-06-01

He more or less created the field of human ecology and his books have had a major influence on the environmental movement. All of his books are worth reading and are recommended. However Shepard is not to be taken lightly. His work is dense, at times difficult, and will shake up your thinking. From his first major work, &quot;Man in the landscape,&quot; to the end of his life he threw off ideas like a grinding stone throwing off sparks. If you are really serious about the idea that human evolutionary history is important to our current lives then Paul Shepard is for you.

For some reason Year Zero is in simple fiction as opposed to Science Fiction; believe me, this is Science Fiction at it's very best. <br />I bought this because it was on a table with `new in paperback' and I was headed out for a week in Central America. I'm sure glad I did; this is one terrific read. I was absorbed in it the first 4 days and then my son took it for the rest of the week and was just as delighted.<br />I haven't read anything else by Jeff Long, but I'm looking forward to it. This book has big, bold themes and while the `science' may be a bit weak, it is good enough. The moral lesson is not a ball-bat to the head, but it's there for you if you want. <br />I really recommend this book and wish that publishers did not, as Kurt Vonnegut once observed, put all SciFi in one drawer and then use that drawer as a urinal. Good SciFi is good fiction; plan and simple.	2003-03-28

So when I saw this on the Sci-Fi shelf I was really excited. Unfortunately, this is not just bad Science Fiction, it's bad fiction. I began to think that Carr was going to satirize Sci-Fi early on when I encountered (pg 49) \\"'It has been said,' Tressalian expained, `that the man who controls electromagnetism controls the known forces of our universe'.\\" This is about as much a clich or hackneyed idea as possible. Furthermore it is almost word for word a quote from Chester Gould, creator of Dick Tracy comics. This occurred in the 1960s when Gould was in serious decline and had introduced space ships, people living on the moon and eating giant escargot into his strip. The phrase was so ridiculous that it became a poster sold in head shops all over the country. When I read it in Carr's book I thought that his intent was to take on Sci-Fi with broad humor. However this is not the case. This book rambles along with the preposterous plot that \\"information is not knowledge\\" but by manipulating information you can change the course of history, topple governments, and all sorts of stuff. There is also the usual assortment of genetic manipulation, some weird female circumcision thrown in for no apparent reason. I have no idea what Carr was trying to do with this book, it's boring, and it's long; a deadly combination.	2003-02-15

Although this book is now 7 years old, it seems more relevant today than when Dowie wrote it. I keep hoping for a new, revised, edition. The elections of 2000 and 2002 have shown that the mainstream environmental organizations in the U.S. have lost most of their strength in the political arena. Despite major attempts to influence elections. . .the Senatorial race in Colorado for example. . .their efforts were either not effective or salient to the electorate. The Green Party seems to have filtered off those voters who are primarily concerned with environmental issues and most indications are that those voters are not impressed with the mainstream environmental establishment in the U.S. The Green Parties of Europe seem to be making a resurgence, but progress in the U.S. is not evident. <br />Dowie's main critique is of the established, major environmental organizations; those groups who enjoyed so much growth during the Reagan era as a reaction to James Watt and others in the Reagan Cabinet. While Gale Norton is from the same mold as Watt, and Christy Todd Whitman is not far removed, they do not seem to be provoking the same degree of unrest among America's electorate. Arguable the Administration of George \\"5-4\\" W. Bush is even worse than Reagan Administration in Environmental Policy, and seem to be drifting even further since the 2002 elections. However the major environmental organizations do not seem to be able to focus attention, or perhaps interest, on this issue. The reason for that may be changing social and cultural norms, but it also may be due to the perception that these organizations are not relevant.<br />Dowie's book may be a bit out-of-date, but it is well worth the read. I think Dowie was right in 1995 and his ideas still ring true today.	2002-11-29

As such they are folksy and often humorous. But, they represent one of the clearest representations of the Theravada path of Buddhism you are likely to find. The Theravada path is, at least until recently in the West, the lesser known of the two major divisions of Buddhism. In recent years the interest in this path, which places emphasis on the Monastic life and strict meditation, has grown. But, for the most part, those interested have not had the wealth of printed material that is available on Zen or Tibetan paths. <br />Ajahn Chah often uses examples from Zen and other Buddhist paths. While at one time the Theravada path was most common path, it has, over the centuries, had less influence in the West. This book, along with the works of Jack Kornfield and Joseph Goldstein, gives us a powerful view into that approach to Buddhism and its relevance to the development of spirituality in the West.	2002-04-25

Thus what I'm going to say relates to the entire series, not just this first part. As to the first part, it will suck you in with the hope that all of the following five long, long, long episodes are as good; they are not. Nothing about the final books is as good as the first, or even the second.<br />Marion Zimmer Bradley says (Why Stories Get Rejected) that one of the fatal errors of science fiction is resorting to some outside power to resolve the story rather than having the main character(s) do it on their own. This series has outside forces to spare. One is introduced in the first installment, but seems to be put in hibernation. But in each subsequent book more and more unexplainable outside forces, omipotent, all-intelligent, supra-normal, beings or forces come on the scene. And the end. . .well, let's just say the main characters DO NOT resolve the issues by themselves. <br />Another thing about this series that got my goat was the disappearance of primary characters at the drop of a word processor. The first two books and the middle two books (The Neutronium Alchemist) introduce a plot and characters that simply disappear on a single page toward the end of the fourth installment (oh, one of them comes back as a crew-member, but of no signifigance). This disregard for plot line and point-of-view really drove me crazy. I kept expecting them to come back right up to the end. For example, the main character has a brother suddenly show up and present a nice plot twist. Is the twist resolved? No, the brother just disappears into the background (as another crew member). <br />I realize that long, long, long series are all the rage in SF these days, but the last couple of books in this series don't make any sense. I was not only disappointed, I was down right ticked off that I'd been tricked into spending my money but worse, my time. I finished this series in Australia but hauled the final book back with meso that I could rail about it. <br />I probably should give this one or two stars, but in all fairness, the first two books, and maybe the third, were pretty good. Especially the action descriptions. But, if you are looking for this entire series to be of that quality, you will be very upset.	2001-10-20

This is a travel book with a very personal twist. The author and his girl friend take off around the world with different goals and with a shakey relationship. The author is not at all confident that they will make it, and several times it seems he may be right. But, they do make it back, together, although that is short-lived.<br />I'm not at all sure why I liked this book so much. It reflects my own view of travel in a lot of ways. Much of what you get in a long trip to foreign lands is relative to what you expect. The title, for example, is an ironic reflection on this often seen advertisment for rooms. In this case it is a portable radio left on full volume all night in the court yard of a very cheap hotel.<br />I am now planning my own trip around the world with a shakey relationship and I want to re-read this book. It is funny and sad, philosophical and helpful. Highly recommended!	2001-06-05

Given that I'll say my reservations up front. This travel guide does not give enough detail to really help you comfortably travel in the region. There is little detail about such issues as how to actually get from one place to another; where is the bus station, etc. The information about accomodations is very brief and for one such as I who really depends on travel guides to help me select hotels, this will be of little help. Even more scanty is the information on food, another important topic for me. I usually rate travel guides on the detail they give to food, and this one falls short. Most of the descriptions are the same; &quot;small resturants line the square.&quot;<br />If what you are looking for is a good, basic coverage of cultural issues and history, this is a good. . .make that very good. . .book. The photography is excellent and the material covered is informative, comprehensive and well written. I enjoyed reading this book very much and I am passing it along to my potential travel companions. The writers put the history of the Silk Road and the Taklamakan desert in perspective for me so that when I do get there, I'll be better prepared to understand what I see.<br />If you are looking for arm chair travel only, this is an excellent book. The writing is clear and includes all the detail you need to enjoy the experience of the Silk Road. On that basis it should receive 5 stars.	2001-01-20

This edition  has some of the classic essays from earlier editions, but is expanded to  cover the Clinton administration and address issues of a global nature.    I  have been using this series as a basic text in graduate courses in  environmental policy for years. I consider it to be a primary source of not  only teaching, but research and basic information. All of the essays are  clearly written and as unbiased as possible. I give this my highest  recommendation.    (Addendum in 2007. This series is up to six editions with a seventh due out this summer. All are essential for the serious student of environmental policy and history).	2000-09-06

I just finished the first two installments of this tetralogy and I don't  think I'll finish it. The writing is, no doubt, brilliant and inspired,  however, the plot never emerges and characters come and go with little  regard for purpose. If you love fine langauge, then this is for you. If you  like a compelling story, solid plots, and absorbing narrative, I'd suggest  you look elsewhere.	2000-08-22
US	53048121	R1FWXZZF3XVFB9	9622176534	856343646	The Galapagos Islands:	Books	3	7	8	N	Y	A disappointing guide	I bought this book due to the somewhat glowing reviews. I usually don't complain about that, but in this case I feel compelled to post a warning: if you are thinking of buying this book as a travel guide, don't! It has very little information about how to travel in the Galapagos, in fact I don't think the author really wants you to go to the Islands because he complains throughout the book about the impact of tourism.<br />The book is poorly edited with numerous mistakes. For example, Constant attributes \\"survival of the fittest\\" to Charles Darwin in the very weak section on evolution. In fact that phrase belongs to Herbert Spencer writing about evolution. In another area the author states there are two species of snakes on the islands, then goes on to describe eight species. One pet peeve, he calls Gulls, \\"seagulls\\" throughout the book, a very common, but galling mistake. I believe that English is not the author's first language and this shows throughout. In one area there is a reference to \\"black men\\" which doesn't seem to relate to anything else in the paragraph. This should have been noticed by the editors.<br />I think the sections on geology and history are probably very good, but the section on evolution is rife with mistakes. I won't detail them here, but if you want to know about Darwin and the influence of the Galapagos on the development of the theory of evolution, go somewhere else; this book will seriously mislead you.<br />The strong point of the book, the the only reason I gave it three instead of two stars, is the photographs. This are by the author and are outstanding, especially the underwater photos. The species lists seem very good and this book, if used with a good travel guide, would probably enhance a trip to the Galapagos.	2000-07-27

His wife and partner, Florence, worked to finalize it and bring it to publication. We all owe a debt of gratitude to her for that. Paul Shepard threw off ideas  like sparks during his life and this last effort is just that; sparks of  ideas which we can only regret will never see the full development of his  other works. However, whether you are a fan (or foe) of Paul Shepard and  his ideas, this book will not fail to challenge your thinking.<br />The book  is a series of essays on a wide range of subjects, centered around  Shepard's central thesis that human ecology was too centered on the 20th  century, and not enough on the Pleistocene. I have all of Paul Shepard's  books, but I often find myself returning to this one when I have a few  moments to reflect. Try it, you will be rewarded.	2000-07-17
US	53048121	R37SZ75C8KMIXG	0820319805	231482890	Nature and Madness	Books	5	46	46	N	Y	The disjunction from our past and our modern dilemma	Paul Shepard is the seminal thinker/writer in the field of human ecology. His works have been widely influential and caused some distress amongst environmental groups. This work was originally published by Sierra Club  books, but withdrawn in two years because of the controversial ideas.<br /> In  this, the final volume of a trilogy (The Tender Carnivore and the Sacred  Game and Thinking Animals being the first two) he furthers his thesis that  seperation from our pleistocene past has caused a modern disjunction with  nature and may be the most important cause of modern problems.<br />His  indictment of history;  &quot;(history) is itself a Western invention whose  central theme is the rejection of habitat. It formulates experience outside  of nature and tends to reduce place to location.... It seeks causality in  the conscious, spiritual, ambitious character of men and memorializes them  in writing&quot; (page 47), is one aspect of Shepard's view that modern  human culture is pathological.<br />Paul Shepard is not easy to read. His  ideas are unsettling and his writing style is dense at times. However, it  seems that he is a philosopher who will influence thinking not only about  nature and human relationships with nature, but about society and  &quot;progress.&quot; <br />&quot;Nature and Madness&quot; will upset your  view of the world you live in, which is probably the main reason for  reading it.	2000-07-04

I bought it because  it is &quot;recommended&quot; and I was going through one of those phases.  I've never been more favorable impressed. I don't 'dog-ear' novels very  often, but I did this one. Time and again Powers manages to make sense and  beauty out of the dry matter of amino acids. If you want to know about the  recent mapping of the human genome and what the personal and cultural  implications of this leap forward are, I can do no better than to recommend  this book.<br />Powers weaves two (at least) stories together in a manner  which left me wanting more and more. This is a big hefty book and, to my  mind, only about half as long as I would have liked it to be. I was caught  up in both stories and spend hours looking up the references to make sure  the author &quot;had it right.&quot; He does, on all levels. Read this  book!	2000-07-01
US	53048121	R3NTLILKD3UQ3R	0300083238	535692988	A Darwinian Left: Politics, Evolution, and Cooperation	Books	4	15	20	N	Y	Marxism and evolution	This very short book, or slightly long essay, is an examination of the implications of Darwinian thinking on the Marxist side of the social and political left. Anything Peter Singer writes is worth reading, and this  little book takes less than an hour. Singer sort of makes the mistake of  saying all leftist thinking is Marxist, even though he starts off with a  comparison with the ideas of the anarchists. This small caveat is the  reason for 4 stars. This is a good book and if you are interested in  Darwinian thinking, ethics, politics, social reform, or whatever, you will  enjoy it. Good bibliography as well	2000-04-19

Some of the other reviewers of this book seem to have missed the point that this is the text of lectures, not a book length analysis of the policatical left in modern America. Rorty's intent, it seems to me, was to  provoke thinking about leftist activity at the political level, not analyse  leftist theory. As with other of his works, Rorty is openingly an advocate  of a return of the influence of Dewey. I really recommend this book,  especially to those who consider themselves on the political left and are  wondering why the importance of social reform in America seems to have  faded since Vietnam.	1999-09-19
