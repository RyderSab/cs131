He does not really believe in their cause, and definitely isn't after glory on the battlefront; he is fighting because his family would be shamed, and possibly even killed, if he didn't. Yuan is captured after a dangerous retreat and wakes up injured in a hospital as a war prisoner. Ha Jin, an effortlessly powerful and intelligent writer, takes the 'war is hell' approach away from the front lines and casts its light onto the plight of POWs, who must struggle to survive a deadly, \\"Lord of the Flies\\" type battle for superiority and favor among their fellow prisoners. Yuan, an educated man fluent in English, is quickly sought after for his communication skills but is largely unable to fit in with his fellow prisoners, who are suspicious of his alliances and envious of his talents. His devotion to the Communists is constantly called into question, but even the Nationalists Yuan encounters question his motives. Yuan remains stuck in the middle, a man who did not want to fight in the first place but must convince the Communists of his sincerity in order to return home to his ailing mother and beloved fiance. Through his eyes we see the hypocrisy, violence, and baseness of all sides in the war. Because Yuan is not truly allied with any of the sides he encounters he can see them for what they truly are -- from the American GIs guarding the prisoners to the Communists he must endear himself to, Yuan lays bare the cold realities of their existence. He seethes with indignity at the Communist government that is using him as an object, and at how his superiors in prison continue to do the same.  Yuan wants nothing but to return home, even though he knows that he will be branded a coward by his government and must forever live with the stigma of being 'war trash'. The Communist government sees his very life as an embarassment to them, because they teach their soldiers that they should die fighting rather than be taken captive. What do you do when no one trusts you or gives a damn whether you live or die?<br /><br />\\"War Trash\\" is an excellent novel.

She can instantly set a mood or a tone with just a few choice words, and draws you into the world of Wyoming so fully that you begin to feel like you've actually experienced it before (assuming, of course, that you haven't in real life). The hardships of ranch life and the loneliness (and sometimes aching futility)of each character makes 'Close Range' a fast and very compelling read. From the opening lines of \\"The Half-Skinned Steer\\" to the close of \\"Brokeback Mountain\\", 'Close Range' is a solid page turner. Small wonder that John Updike included \\"The Half-Skinned Steer\\" in 'The Best American Short Stories of the Century', and \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" has now been turned into a movie. And how heartfelt each story is! Each story provokes a deep emotional response, and \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a beautiful, though heartbreaking, cap to the collection. Proulx's total mastery of the short story form makes for an enjoyable, highly reccomendable read.	2005-10-01

I wanted to, but I have to admit that the subject matter seemed pretty standard for an award-winning book: 'The God of Small Things' centers around a tragedy that rends a family apart and its lasting effects on the twins who were at the heart of it. But the truth is that there is little that is standard about Arundhati Roy's writing. She tells her story in a completely original narrative that puts you inside the heads of the young twins who drive the plot. You see the world through the slightly fantastic, exaggerated eyes of a child caught in very grown-up circumstances. I can see that some would criticize her style as \\"weird\\", but that is the whole beauty of it. Most children that I know see the world in a slightly off-kilter way (and I know for a fact that I did). That's just the nature of kids. The innocence of the perspective makes the events of the plot seem that much more disturbing and downright chilling. I was wrong to expect a by-the-numbers book when I picked this up. Ms. Roy's novel is very original and well written. Now if only she would write another fiction book!	2005-09-28

Harry has come out of the angry funk he was mired in during 'Order of the Phoenix' and is, for the first time, truly ready to begin facing his destiny against Lord Voldemort. He begins receiving private lessons from Professor Dumbledore to explore Voldemort's past and, hopefully, uncover the weakness that will allow him to be defeated. There are none of the pacing problems that plagued 'Order of the Phoenix', and Rowling has clearly come into her own as a writer. With this book she elevates her already classic series to the level of such greats as the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is truly amazing how she manages to make each book more mature and timeless as Harry grows up and learns to see the world for what it truly is. Having said that, I will warn parents that Harry Potter is no longer safe territory for the younger set, as Harry experiences the full extent of Voldemort's power in this book, and the finale will most likely be traumatizing to any fan below the young adult level (even more-so than the end of 'Goblet of Fire'). 'Half-Blood Prince' sets itself as the 'Empire Strikes Back' of the Harry Potter series, and stands out as the best because it is not afraid to allow the bad guys to win.<br /><br />A lot of criticism has been bestowed upon this book because it avoids getting tangled up in the front lines of the war on Lord Voldemort. I thought this was very wise on J.K. Rowling's part, and actually lent credence to the plotline. Harry is a teenager, and Chosen One or not his business is at Hogwarts as a student. It is very truthful, because even in times of war life does go on, and I suspect that 'Half-Blood Prince' is merely illustrating that point. Certainly all of us at home can attest to that in times like these. We go to work or school every day, then catch up on the news in Afghanistan (or, more recently, London) in the newspaper or on the television. That is where Rowling's series excels: that, even in a fantastic and improbable setting like Hogwarts, she captures the truth of the real world.cels: that, even in a fantastic and improbable setting like Hogwarts, she captures the truth of the real world.	2005-07-22

He quit college and his dreams of a better life to return to his home town and be with his dying mom, only to get snared in the web of his mother's former employer (a villain almost Shakespearean in design, though much more subtle). Through Miles' story we learn the history of the town and of its people -- and it is remarkable how Russo manages to make each character and their story equally realistic and compelling. It is quite interesting to see how these people live, and how their actions have karmic repercussions as time passes. Russo paints a vivid portrait of a small town, and is equally capable of quaintness and jarring the reader. One hardly minds that much of the book is ultimately predictable because the journey is such a good one, and there will be at least one big surprise for the reader to ponder.	2005-06-06

From the day she first experimented with alcohol at age 14 to the severe binge-drinking that defined her college years, she takes you on a journey of excess and provides the reasons for her escalating problem. The situations she gets into are dark (waking up naked in a man's bed with the suspicion that she had been the victim of date-rape, having her stomach pumped after passing out on a dock at age 16, etc.), making for a compelling read that is at once hard to put down and difficult to hear. Looking back, Zailckas can see the reasons for her drinking and does a decent job getting across some explanations that are hard to explain to anyone who hasn't felt the same way. The most interesting revelation in the book is that Zailckas is not actually an alcoholic, but a victim of alcohol abuse. When she reaches out to a counselor on the internet she discovers that she has none of the genetic characteristics that describe alcoholism. Zailckas' problem is that excess was encouraged to her in a society that more and more sees teen drinking as a rite of passage instead of the problem it is. Her depression and insecurity made her an easy target to lose control, and no one was able to see her problem for what it was. 'Smashed' exposes a new social problem that has not been acknowledged in the media so far, and Zailckas is to be commended for bringing it out for discussion.	2005-03-14

And what joy! 'Snobs' has all of the wit, honesty, and intrigue of Gosford Park without feeling at all like a retread. It is about Edith, a socially ambitious woman who marries into wealth and privilege; however, once she has achieved her dream she becomes restless and hopelessly bored with the life she has chosen. Her life spins into scandal and, possibly, redemption as Fellowes uncovers just how shallow our ambitions can be. The true success of 'Snobs' is that it doesn't feel critical of human nature, just honest. Fellowes' prose is a joy to read, being both light and humorous. I would highly recommend this book.	2005-03-02

I got my wish with this book, which is a re-printing of an earlier work of his.  In the author's note Martel refers to its stories as his world premiere, harking back to the days when he was just starting out as a writer. He ambitiously set out to combine intellect and emotion in his stories, reasoning that intellect makes a story last while it is emotion that makes it relatable and appeals to the reader.  It is easy to see Martel's developing genius in these stories, but there are unfortunate growing pains as well.  In his quest to write stories both intelligent and stirring Martel did what most inexperienced writers will do: he over-reached.  The stories are intellectual (at times inaccessably so), and there is plenty of emotion represented, but there is little heart.  The lone exception is the titular story, about a man and his dying friend, who create a fictional family to tell stories about.  It's a brilliant story, executed as only the author of a book like 'Life of Pi' could do.  'The Time I Heard the Private Donald J. Rankin String Concerto with One Discordant Violin, by the American composer John Morton' really could have done with a shorter title, but is almost up to Martel's standard.  It's too long; the description of the concert itself could have been shorter as that part is boring, and the real meat of the story gets crammed into the somewhat illogical events of the last few pages.  The meat, once you've gotten to it, is quite juicy actually.  The payoff saves the story, but the same can't be said of 'Manners of Dying' -- which has an interesting premise but leads nowhere.  It's high-concept writing that misses the mark.  'The Vita Aeterna Mirror Company' has a great message to relate, but the medium sending it is far from perfect.<br /><br />I would recommend this book only to big fans of 'Life of Pi', because I do not think that anyone who was new to Yann Martel would appreciate this book for what it is: a starting point.  As for myself, I'm revising my previous belief that I wanted to read something else by Martel to that I would like to read something new by him., because I do not think that anyone who was new to Yann Martel would appreciate this book for what it is: a starting point.

Confused about who she is and what the world sees her as she falls into a series of misadventures before returning to her home country of Iran. It is a beautifully told story about a girl becoming a woman and coming to terms with her turbulent heritage. There aren't enough awards you could give Satrapi for her brilliant work. She has captured her life story with honesty and amazing talent. Reading her books is a joy and I only hope that she will put out a third volume in the future. I will never tire of hearing her story.	2004-10-02

'Little Children' left me wanting more and 'Election' delivered. It is a riotous look at a high school election gone horribly wrong and the lives that become tangled up in it. The cast of characters are at once utterly real and complete caricatures. Their actions are believable, their thought processes complete and yet they are exaggerations of the people we know in daily life (not to mention a whole lot funnier). 'Election' is a breeze at 200 pages but a very worthwhile read. It would be the perfect book to bring on a plane, for a day trip to the beach, or a nice rainy day entertainment. If you haven't read anything by Perrotta yet this is a good place to start, and if you have it'll make the hunger for his next book more intense.	2004-08-23

Gross horrors occur including bombings, murders, arrests and riots but what is so extraordinary about Marjane Satrapi's story is how otherwise it is so ordinary. She experiments with cigarettes, listens to punk music and hangs posters on her walls -- all the trimmings of an American adolescent's life. This gives 'Persepolis' a universal appeal, an accessability that makes the differences all the more shocking. The stark reality that Satrapi and her family live in constant danger is effecting, and it will not leave you when you put the book down. The style Satrapi uses in her drawings clearly sets the tone of her story. There is a childish innocence to the illustrations perfectly suited to the worldview of our narrator, herself a child at the beginning. Her gradual awakening to the ways of the world has all of the truth and optimism that make 'To Kill a Mockingbird' the classic it is today. 'Persepolis' earns its place among stories like that and 'The Catcher in the Rye'. I would highly recommend it to anyone, and can't wait for the sequel.	2004-08-23
US	50682072	RSHKO70IUYZRV	0375401466	160007841	Old School	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Wolff is simply the best	With this novel Tobias Wolff cements his status as one of the greatest writers of our time. 'Old School' - his first full length novel - does not lose any of the impact of his short stories and proves that he is an author capable of taking on any format (including his autobiography 'This Boy's Life'). At a prestigious boarding school for boys in the early sixties we meet our narrator as he begins his senior year - a year which will bring him successs and great consequences. 'Old School' masterfully weaves a variety of themes including friendship, honor, betrayal, and the loss of innocence with a palpable love of literature. This admiration for the classics and also for the craft of writing adds a heartfelt layer to a book that was already amazing simply based on its story. And how appropriate that Wolff pays tribute to classic authors like Hemingway and Ayn Rand as 'Old School' itself is an instant classic (not to mention a joy to read). Highly recommended.	2004-02-27

Deeply troubled and damaged by his life with an uncaring mother and a father who disappeared one day Vernon is unable to fathom the severity of his situation and falls further and further into a hole he unwittingly helps dig. Masterfully written in a gritty and original style 'Vernon God Little' mixes dark comedy and drama to perfection. It certainly deserves a spot among the classics.<br />I must add that I was surprised to see the reviews that criticize this book. They seem to be caught up in the world Vernon lives in and fail to see that the book is not actually about that and is in fact about Vernon. I got the impression that this was intended as parody rather than fact and more condemnation of media extortion than of crass Americans. As for the ending: anyone who tries to tell you that this book has a cheap happy ending probably didn't get it. But the hallmark of a good book is that it is open to interpretation ('Life of Pi' being another example).	2004-02-24

Packer's story collection - a member of the Today Show's book club - gets off to a great start. 'Brownies' and 'Every Tongue Shall Confess' rank high among my very favorite short stories. Both are excellent parables of faith, prejudice, religion, and the impulsive nature of youth. Both stories also use role reversal to interesting effect and leave you with interesting questions to consider. 'Our Lady of Peace', the third story in the collection, is also a triumph of writing but is unfortunately hampered by a sudden, confusing ending that doesn't satisfy the build-up or give the reader much sense of what happens next. Then comes 'The Ant of the Self' - and this is where Packer's book goes south. It is impossible to see why the narrator of this story does the things that he does - or why he starts out so strong and determined but winds up repeatedly allowing his deadbeat father to walk all over him and screw things up. The change makes absolutely no sense and leaves the story frustrating. 'Drinking Coffee Elsewhere' regains some of the book's initial charm but 'Speaking in Tongues' takes it right back down. Again it is the maddening choices of its very young main character that do it. Why a girl ostensibly looking for her mother would CHOOSE to repeatedly place herself into incredibly dangerous situations with a controlling pimp with aspirations of molestation is woefully unclear . 'Geese' is an improvement but can't help but suffer the same problem. The characters find themselves in incredibly dire situations but basically let disaster keep knocking on their door. 'Doris Is Coming' is a mediocre story about a girl who wants to join the black power movement though her church will not condone it. Ultimately 'Drinking Coffee Elsewhere' is an uneven collection of stories with two incredible highs and some dismal lows.	2004-02-24

Her account of her series of health issues and of her mother's illness has a morbid fascination about it, but it's her writing that really attracts the reader.

Jeff Noon possesses an incredible creativity that at times creeps you out with its perversity but never fails to stagger you with its power. It would be very interesting to get a cup of coffee with this guy and have a conversation with him. In a nutshell the book is about a man who loses his sister in another dimension of sorts (called a vurt) only accessible through use of a rare and highly dangerous feather drug. His quest to find her is an unusual and thoroughly exciting ride even if I'm not quite sure what deeper message it is trying to send. 'Vurt' is well worth reading for its truly unique nature and its ability to draw you in and hold you under its spell. It is that rare novel which cannot be adequately described - it must be experienced.	2004-02-24

That is one of my favorite books, so I was eager to see what she would do next. That level of expectation usually only serves to hurt a book, but 'The Namesake' is up to the task. Lahiri masterfully weaves a compelling story that doesn't fall into the trap that most short story writers get into when they write a full novel (inevitably most seem drawn out and boring, as if the writer is simply trying to fill the pages). The beautiful prose draws you into the story of Gogol, the son of immigrants from India named after the Russian author. 'The Namesake' is about the gap between Gogol and his family -- he born into America and wanting to fit in with our society, his parents unable to let go of the land they knew and the customs they grew up with. Gogol spends his life distancing himself from them and their ways, somewhat desperately trying to assimilate himself to the American way of life. It is a very relatable, very real story that feels close to the reader's heart and is true to life. This is all thanks to Jhumpa Lahiri, an author with a unique understanding of complex human emotions and an incredible ability to convey them to the reader. 'The Namesake' made the wait from her last book worth the while, and leaves you impatient for her next book all over again.	2003-09-26

Although brimming with insight when it comes to maths and sciences he becomes clumsy and awkward whenever faced with an unfamiliar social situation or place. You see there's a twist to Christopher that makes him unlike all other narrators: he is a 15 year old boy suffering from autism. Reading this book allows the reader to have a glimpse of his life and how his mind works. The genius and utter realism of this feat lies with the author, who treats the matter with great respect but sometimes brutal honesty. When made uncomfortable Christopher may have a temper tantrum, groan loudly or even lash out with his fists. But it is impossible not to find him likable because Haddon makes you see that this is only part of who he is and shows all of his other attributes as well. A truly 3 dimensional character is hard to find but you need look no further for one. The book's premise is that after a neighbor's dog is killed Christopher decides to do some detective work like Sherlock Holmes (his favorite character). This investigation is an unexpected catalyst in Christopher's life, and he soon finds his strenuously organized existence spiralling out of control. It's really about an intelligent, complex boy awash in a world he cannot understand or control. He is surrounded by many intense emotions and actions and though he can recite thousands of prime numbers he is at a loss to explain them. This book is a joy to read and a heartfelt reminder that we can get over our own obstacles. You won't be forgetting Christopher Boone any time soon.	2003-06-28

The ups and numerous downs of his stay make for an engrossing if at times squirmy read. Perhaps the best part of the book is Frey's unflinching honesty with what happened and what he felt. It takes guts to put yourself out there like that and he should be commended for his perspective. 'A Million Little Pieces' is also notable for its dead-on portrayal of a man rebuilding his life. Frey does a remarkable job getting across the conflicting emotions and needs that you feel. His attempts at reconciliation with the family he has been trying to push away his whole life are particularly good. The awkwardness, the guilt and the anger are all present and splendidly captured. It is in these moments that '...Pieces' strikes a chord the most. If you have ever wondered or experienced what it is like to find yourself in a deep hole and to try to climb out of it and lead a 'normal' life this is the book for you. Nobody tells it like Frey does.	2003-05-04

It is a masterpiece of creative energy and of the unique vision of its creator. Foer has wrought a compelling narrative that strikes the perfect balance between its dramatic core and the humorous tone he often adopts. The writing is complex without becoming difficult or heavy, and even the relentless assault on the English language that comes whenever Alex takes over the narration is a joy to read. &quot;Everything...&quot; is the story of three very different men who embark on a quest to find an old town that has become lost and a woman who lived there. On the surface their purpose is simply to find the woman who saved 'the author's' family during WWII and to thank her. But there is so much more. These men are seeking identity, meaning, a purpose, an escape, and absolution. What they find is what makes this book a masterpiece. It was a close call to choose the best book of 2002 (&quot;Middlesex&quot; and &quot;Life of Pi&quot; being the other contenders) but without a doubt that title has to be given to &quot;Everything is Illuminated&quot;.	2003-04-04

Katherine Dunn writes with a force and bravado I haven't seen anywhere else. Her descriptive style is somewhat unsettling and dark but ALWAYS paints a picture so vivid that you can almost see, smell or taste whatever it is she's writing about. It's amazing how real she can make the world she's invented seem. From page one she has you riveted to her story and refuses to let go until the very last page. And what a thrill to be so captivated by a book! To be that caught up in a story is a rare feat, and yet Dunn does it so effortlessly that it belies the incredible talent that goes behind it. 'Geek Love' is the story of a family that is completely unlike yours and yet so familiar that it is almost creepy. Through a family of 'freaks' Dunn eloquently explores a wide array of themes and leaves the reader with much to consider. It is a celebration of the unique and a parable of family. It is about the follies of self-righteousness and the pains of dependency. It is a story of acceptance, of love and devotion, of how far we will go and how terrified we can be to take a single step. Quite simply, 'Geek Love' is brilliant. Everyone should read this book -- it's appeal is universal as is its message. Each person can find something to take from it that may forever alter the way you see the world (and isn't that the hallmark of quality literature in a nutshell?).	2003-02-23

Ann Packer seems a capable writer and, if anything, 'The Dive From Clausen's Pier' shows her promise. Unfortunately her debut novel is uneven. The dialogue feels unnatural, like an after school special's view of how people in their early twenties talk (we certainly don't begin every conversation with 'What's up?,' or refer to our female friends as 'girl' as often as these people do). Packer's characters also lack depth -- a crippling blow to her novel as complex, identifiable characters are an essential part of morality tales like this one. They act like cardboard cutouts: this is Rooster, Mike's loyal best friend with a temper; or Jamie, Carrie's petulant best friend who can't seem to mature beyond college; or Mike's domineering mother, whose fierce expectations keep Carrie tethered to Mike's bedside. These basic character descriptions are all that there is to these people. They never change, never do anything to challenge your perceptions of them, and are all hopelessly selfish. The only character who is not only concerned with themself is Carrie and that is because it is her struggle that gives the book its plot. Had Carrie been more than a one note character her story could have been a moving one. Packer's writing itself is good. She gives a nice sense of setting and has a strong descriptive style. This is where her promise is most evident, and it will be interesting to see how she fares in her next novel. If she masters these elements her writing will have all the makings of the perfect guilty pleasure.	2003-01-31

The story at its basic level alone is engrossing (that being the survival of a boy trapped in a lifeboat with a Bengal Tiger). Pi's degradation from an unremarkable, vegetarian boy to a fierce hunter dining on the blood and flesh of the sea life he is able to capture is well mapped. One is reminded of Golding's 'Lord of the Flies' in this aspect and 'Life of Pi' does not disappoint. But this is not the only way to look at this book. Martel has imbued his novel with a multitude of layers working together to create a masterpiece of literature. It is not difficult to see how the book won the Mann Booker Prize this year -- one would be hard pressed indeed to fail to see the brilliant craftsmanship behind it. Three cheers to Yann Martel for pulling off such a mighty concept, and for writing what is quite possibly the best book of 2002.	2003-01-08

I had quite a hard time getting involved, and while it was technically speaking a decent read I felt uninvolved and worse uninterested. Then somewhere toward the middle of the book I found myself enthralled. All of a sudden it was clear that yes, this book did in fact win the National Book Award for a reason. Julia Glass masterfully weaves a heartfelt and captivating narrative that is deceptively simple and light. The characters have depth and are well drawn out and realistic, particularly Fenno. In the end it is hard not to like Three Junes, and I would indeed recommend that you read this delightful tale of love and relationships, in all of their forms.	2002-12-10
US	50682072	RKJF72U91YRLF	0007141076	958226210	Unless: A Novel	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Well done tale of disillusion and loss	'Unless' is the story Reta Winters, a so-called light novelist who has never truly had to endure hardship or disappointment. She has lived in quiet content, satisfied that while her life is not perfect it is far from unbearable. All that changes when her oldest daughter inexplicably drops out of college and begins living in a homeless shelter, refusing her families' urgings for her to return home. Now Reta is struggling to go on with her life in a world she no longer understands and feels an intense anger toward. The story is not perfect; one or two characters are somewhat exaggerated (for example Arthur Springer, Reta's hands-on editor), and the story is just slightly jumbled at times. But the overall impression the book leaves is a good one. Shields' prose is delicate and intricately crafted, weaving an enjoyable story that moves quickly and takes hold of the reader. While it may not be the best book of the year it certainly comes close.	2002-11-20

After slogging through Cornwell's book however all I feel is certain is that there isn't actually much left to know. Little to no evidence is left to examine, police reports and other key papers have long since disappeared, and forensic examination performed by the doctors and policeman was woefully insufficient to build any kind of case against a suspect. Yet Cornwell persists in arguing that Walter Sickert, a painter and student of Whistler, was the true identity of Jack the Ripper. She sounds definite in her opinion, but I fail to see how such specious reasoning could convince anyone else. All in all 'Portrait of a Killer' is an unsatisfying read. The reader comes away with scant information about the killings other than that it was a forensic nightmare, and no more of an idea who Jack the Ripper was than they had when they began the book.	2002-11-19

Its lovingly crafted structure is a real breath of fresh air -- one would be hard pressed to find another book like it out there. One must admire Mark Dunn not only for his lively imagination but for his awe-inspiring power over words. It is fun to see how he manages to continue telling his story while avoiding use of a growing number of letters in the alphabet. Never once does his prose sound forced or simple, even after he must resort to using his remaining letters to phonetically sound out his words. The plot (citizens on an island off the coast of the US rebel after their government begins restricting their use of the alphabet) could have easily been silly, cliched and like a poor man's 'Animal Farm' but instead forges out its own solid identity and endears itself to the reader through its inventiveness and wit. One can't help but enjoy 'Ella Minnow Pea'. I read it in one afternoon and my only complaint is that it had to end.	2002-11-04

Lahiri's prose is delicate and draws you into the world of each of her stories. Her characters are lifelike and endearing, she really makes you feel for them in a short span of time, and the settings are vivid and clear. Each story is entrancing and delicate, there isn't a single one that isn't good. If I had to choose I would say that 'A Temporary Matter' is my favorite, with 'Mrs. Sen's' and 'Sexy' being close seconds. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, it is far too good to miss out on. The only shame here is that Lahiri has not written another book to follow up to this one. It would be a shame to waste such amazing talent.	2002-09-19

I was a little thrown when I heard that 'Middlesex' was a decades spanning novel beginning with an incestuous relationship and how that leads to the existence of Calliope Stephanides, a hermaphrodite. Seems like risky subject matter, and very difficult to pull off. But Eugenides manages it wonderfully. He weaves a complex narrative that delves from Cal's present living as a man in Berlin to his childhood as a confused daughter to 1922, when Cal's grandparent's began to fall in love despite their status as brother and sister. Eugenides pulls you from generation to generation and through each chapter of Cal's life with great skill. While there are relatively few lulls in the story 'Middlesex' is at its best in the last half, as Cal careens inevitably to the discovery of what he is and then struggles to decide what that means for him and those around him. 'Middlesex' is a success where it had great potential to foul up. I for one can't wait to see what Eugenides has in mind next...	2002-08-28
US	50682072	R1UCV0BM4SPMEG	0316666343	784206304	The Lovely Bones	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A welcome surprise	The subject matter of this book had me worried when I first heard about it. I mean it's about a girl who is raped and murdered and how she watches her family get torn apart after her death from heaven! Sounds like a weepy, depressing book no one in their right mind would want to read, right? But I gave it a shot because it had so many people talking and raving that I thought I should at least try it. The first two chapters are a bit intense but they are not too gruesome and instead are compelling and make you want to read more. And the book, while one could never exactly call it a happy read, is not altogether depressing or dreary. It makes you think. Their is something touching about the mess Susie watches her family become, even more so as the years pass. It's not a perfect book but it has a clear message and reaches your heart without cloying too hard. The language can get a little overboard but manages not to give the impression of manipulating you in the way Nicholas Sparks would. Ultimately the book is about moving on, acknowledging the past as a part of who we are but without letting it define us. It's a nice sentiment, and Sebold gets it across beautifully. She is certainly a talent to watch. If the Lovely Bones is any indication she has a great skill.	2002-07-21

Dominick Dunne's 'Justice' is a look at several criminal trials and their outcomes. As the father of a murdered daughter Dunne's main concern seems to be whether or not justice is served. Unfortunately at times it seems that for one reason or another (mostly wealth or fame) that justice is not served. This is where 'Justice' is at its best, seething with indignation that such things could have an effect over a judge/jury. This is particularly true in the titular installment dealing with the trial of the man who murdered Dunne's daughter, where he is the most personally involved. But 'Justice' is an uneven book. There is far too much of the O.J. Simpson case, which occupies the entire middle of the book (Dunne himself professes that many people seem sick of that trial, then continues to harp on it for another hundred pages or so). In the last half of the book Dunne's incessant name-dropping began to seriously bother me. It seems as though every time he steps out he just happens to run into some well known society figure or celebrity, and there is constant mention of all his famous friends. The final installment, about the Martha Moxley murder trial that just ended now (after the book's publication), is so self-serving that I was tempted to put the book down. The epilogue about 9-11 didn't help either, as Dunne uses the day as an opportunity to point out how his otherwise normal week was turned upside down by relating his schedule of fabulous events that he had gone to on september 10th, unaware of the looming tragedy. After a good start 'Justice' loses something. Many chapters are not as compelling as Dunne seems to think they are, particularly the ones pertaining to O.J. All in all it is not a bad read and I would recommend it to those who are interested in law or perhaps in ethics for the better moments.	2002-06-11

I'm glad that I read it because it is a nice guilty pleasure. I've been a fan of Janet Evanovich and Sue Grafton for a while now and what I really like about this book is that it combines the best of those two lead characters (Stephanie Plum and Kinsy Millhone respectively) into the fun but serious Bailey Weggins. She is easy to like and her life is not so outrageous as to be unbelievable. It would be very easy to follow her exploits further, so I hope that the fact that the cover advertises If Looks Could Kill as 'a Bailey Weggins mystery' means that there is more to come. As for the writing Kate White does a masterful job plotting out her mystery, leading you in many directions without confusing you and throwing in just the right amount of twists. My one complaint would be that the ending seems to happen pretty quickly, but that hardly takes away from the book and actually leaves you interested in what happens next. All in all this was a thoroughly enjoyable read.	2002-05-24

His language is poetic and sticks in your mind after you put the book down. Intricately plotted but not overdone 'Atonement' is remarkably human. The characters are all well drawn and possess real emotions. That is a good thing not just for McEwan's accomplishment as a writer but because it is their emotions that drive the story and make it so compelling. Had they been even slightly off the whole story would have seemed false and lacking in heart. This is a great book, and most certainly worth reading for anyone who loves quality literature.	2002-04-05

I'm so happy that he wrote another book, it would be a shame for such a brilliant humorist to fade into obscurity. While Mind Over Matters, Nelson's second book, isn't as good as his first outing (Mike Nelson's Movie Megacheese) it is a thoroughly satisfying read and still very funny. Movie Megacheese is a hard act to follow since it was so unbelievably funny (and fit into Nelson's area of expertise) that it sets unrealistic expectations for a follow up. Mind Over Matters is up to the task but I still remain true to his first book. In this one the humor focuses on the everyday life and Nelson never fails to make you laugh at the ordinary oddities and annoyances of life. The situations he discusses are pretty universal, so everyone can relate and will have no trouble finding the humor. I would definitely highly reccomend this book to anyone really, but in particular for those who like humor books like Dave Barry's or fans of Nelson's old tv show Mystery Science Theater 3000 (the best show ever made, if I may say so).	2002-03-05

The characters are lacking, the plot a cliched 'I've read this before' mess, and the endings tend to feel tacked on - as if the author just went for whatever would come as a surprise without regard to whether or not it makes sense. Then along comes a book like Mystic River and you remember just how wonderful the genre can be, when done right. Dennis Lehane is a master storyteller. His plot weaves through each character and subplot seamlessly, without making any element seem oddly out of place. His characters are the most well drawn I've seen in a while. Lehane allows you to crawl inside their heads and see why they are who they have become, and each of their actions has a reason, makes sense with what he has built them up to be. The psychological aspects of the characters are what really drive the book and make it so compelling - Jimmy's intense need for revenge on his daughter's killer, Dave's destructive trauma over being kidnapped as a child, and Sean's search for the killer has as much to do with justice as it does with the daughter he has never met. This book is amazing. I can't wait to read the rest of Lehane's books, if this one is any indication they'll be the best out there	2002-03-01

But I am very glad that I gave it a shot because this book is actually very good. It's subject manner is on the serious side (the longtime friend and teammate of a ball player discovers he is dying) but the narration is light and easy, keeping it from getting too dense and dramatic. The style is unique and makes for a pleasant, laid back read. The characters are well drawn and effecting, you get a very good sense of them all and it is impossible not to care about them. As someone who as I said is not a sports fan I can assure you that it is very readable even if you are not also. I will definitely be giving the author's other books in the series a try (I only wish that I had started with 'The Southpaw', which is the first in the series).	2002-01-29

Each one is three-dimensional and you really get a sense of who they are and what they are about. Dolores herself is one of literature's most believable characters. Everything she feels and does is so real and true to the way she is. Despite the downtrodden life she leads you really like her and never stop rooting for her as she careens through life in search of some peace and love. The ride is bumpy - and sometimes her misery does seem a little too much (how many tragedies can befall one person anyway?) but Lamb guides you through it expertly. One thing I don't understand: everyone who told me to read this said that it was &quot;touching but hilarious&quot; and I just don't get that. To me at least, the subject matter is too serious to laugh at. When would you laugh? When Dolores gets raped at 13? When she winds up in a mental hospital for seven years? It's a good book, but funny it isn't.	2001-11-29

It garnered so much praise that one could not help getting drawn in. Unfortunately the book is really not that good. It is too long and frustrating to read after a while. It seems perfectly clear that Franzen thought he was writing something spectacular as the writing is very overwrought and self-important. After the first two parts it becomes increasingly difficult to empathize with the characters, by the time I was halfway through 'the generator' (part four) I honestly didn't even care what happened to any of them, just as long as I never had to deal with them again. After two weeks passed and I had only progressed ten pages beyond that point thanks to an overwhelming reluctance to read anymore I have given up. I've put this book down and couldn't be happier. I am perfectly comfortable not knowing if the Lambert family has their last Christmas together, or if any of them ever cheer up. Hopefully the next time a book generates this amount of hype it will actually deserve it.	2001-10-29

This book should be a must read for every woman out there, but that is not to say that men should not take note as well. It is an incredibly eye-opening look into the lives of another gender. It's funny how you don't really give subjects like this much thought yet assume that you can understand, the truth being that you cannot begin to see how it is, how a person can actually feel alienated from their own body. I actually had to put it down after &quot;My Vagina Was My Village&quot; (the most heartbreakingly compelling monologue in the book) in order to process what I was thinking. But don't think that the whole book is a downer. There are some wonderfully amusing parts mixed in, each as revolutionary and powerful as their more dramatic counterparts. Eve Ensler truly is a goddess for putting this out there. It's message is vital to all human beings to hear. In short, you don't need a vagina to appreciate Ensler's masterpiece.	2001-10-02

I guess I didn't really think that Grafton could keep it up, but I misjudged her. 'C' is for Corpse was equally gripping and fun to read as its predecessors. One of my favorite aspects of the series is the people that Kinsey meets along the way. Grafton's supporting cast is always lively and interesting - no matter how short their part. I would highly recommend this book, or any in the series for that matter, to anyone who likes mysteries - and even those who don't (I was never really a mystery fan until I discovered Grafton's books, so I'm sure anyone could enjoy them as well).	2001-08-14

In this book (and to a smaller degree in 'C') there were many times where I couldn't fathom how Kinsey would keep on the trail and solve the case.

If anything, &quot;B is for Burglar&quot; is superior to its predecessor. While enjoyable, Alibi was a tad too predictable - I knew exactly who the killer was the moment they first showed up. Not so with Burglar. I was still guessing right up to the end, which made it a lot more suspensefull to read. The case in this one is also more difficult since no one really knows the truth about what happened (is Elaine really missing? If not where is she? If she is, is she still alive or has she been killed?). I would highly reccomend this to anyone who likes mysteries, and I can't wait to continue following Kinsey's adventures!	2001-08-01

I went in with lofty expectations, so perhaps I was setting myself up for it. While &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; is very well written it is never as compelling as it should be, as it probably could have been (Eugenides seems very capable of writing compelling literature). I never really saw why the boys were so obsessed with the Lisbon girls, aside from their seclusion. And in the end I was unsatisfied with the mystery the Lisbon girls left behind. Obviously since the boys narrating the story would not have had an adequate explanation it is impossible for us to expect one - but a little more insight into what drove the girls toward their inevitable demises would have been appreciated. I guess that's the point - no one would ever know what it felt like for them, but it still doesn't leave you satisfied.	2001-08-01

The whole book is designed to warm your heart and change your life - but goes about it in such a way that you feel like it's being shoved down your throat. The worst part is how predictable the book is. From page one it is easy to see exactly where the story is going, and Matt's &quot;secret&quot; about his past with Suzanne is not hard to figure out. I'm sure there are people out there who would love this book for the very qualities I just denounced - and in its favor I will say that the book is at least a very fast, light read.

During the entire election it seemed like no one had the courage to expose these facts, and when they did make headlines the story died down suspiciously quickly.

Paul Begala presents the information with a wit that keeps you laughing despite the horrors of W's record. The writing is also very clear and concise, so that even I, someone not very knowledgable of politics, was able to understand each and every section. I just wish that I had discovered this book earlier -- it would have been a godsend in convincing some family members of mine just how awful Bush really is.	2001-02-09

He is recruited by a wizard named Gandalf to accompany a band of dwarves on their quest to reclaim the land and fortune that is rightfully theirs by slaying the dragon who took it from them. Bilbo is a reluctant hero, but nevertheless a memorable one. And his tale is an extraordinary flight of fancy that will stay in your heart forever. I am extremely picky about which books I like to reread, but after reading this for the first time I am sure that there will be a second, as well as a third and fourth. Tolkien is a masterful storyteller, and the world he creates is so vivid and well-conceived that it is easy to lose yourself in the forests of Mirkwood, the Misty Mountains or the desolate Lonely Mountain. Bilbo's adventure is captivating from one leg of the journey to the next. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; touches on issues of greed, courage and friendship without ever losing focus or seeming preachy. The only fault I can find is with me, for not reading it sooner.	2001-01-11

All of the characters from the movie (that aren't thoughtlessly dispatched five pages into the book) have their charisma and any shred of likeability ripped mercilessly from them. Rool and Franjean, who were wonderful as comic sidekicks, are particularly wasted as they become humorless and spend their time calling Willow (renamed Thorn, and I doubt even God knows why) a fool and bragging that they can foresee the future and know how it will all end, wisdom they don't think to use for any good. The story drags and fails to yield much suspense even in action parts. Chris Claremont spends way too much time with minor descriptive elements. At one particularly low point, he went on for several pages to describe in exact detail how each group working in the kitchen of a castle worked to prepare a feast as Willow/Thorn simply passed through the room. I will be honest and say that I could not bring myself to gather the strength to finish this vile book. Nor will I ever feel any urge to pick it up and see how it all works out in the end. You may think that I was exaggerating when I said that this is, in my opinion, the worst book ever written, but I wasn't. Spare yourself the time and energy and do not read this book.	2001-01-05
US	50682072	R1EF88TWRHQIZQ	0345330145	428889418	Puppet Masters	Books	5	27	33	N	N	Scary and thought-provoking	Going in to this book I was skeptical because I had only read one of Heinlein's other books (The Moon is a Harsh Mistress) and absolutely hated it. But from the very first chapter &quot;Puppet Masters&quot; had me hooked. The idea - aliens taking over the world by controlling human beings - is by now a cliche, what with Invasion of the Body Snatchers, the Faculty and other similar tales out there. But even if the idea seems tired I know that you can like this book, because I thought I was tired of it too. As I said, you get hooked early. It really was hard for me to put this book down in a lot of parts. But what is truly scary about the subject matter is how realistically Heinlein portrays it. The way the aliens move their forces outward, how the characters react, and even the final resolution are all reasonably plausible enough to make you paranoid about crowds of people (but then perhaps I'm just gullible). Outside of the story itself, &quot;Puppet Masters&quot; makes a lot of intelligent statements about our fear of assimilation, and ties in to the Cold War effortlessly. Being far too young to know firsthand the paranoia and fear that people must have lived in, &quot;Puppet Masters&quot; becomes all the more intriguing because it helps show the reader the hysteria that our nation must have felt.	2000-12-19

But he truly has outdone himself with this book, in which he delivers swift, crushing vengeance to  the bad movies that plague our society. For all of us unable to express our  feeling of confusion, hatred and general ickiness toward the movies we  hate, Nelson taps into them and manages to even make them funny. And it  doesn't stop there, he takes it a step FURTHER and mocks all of the  bloated, ego obsessed &quot;stars&quot; who make these vile movies! I  highly reccomend this book. The amount of entertainment it gives you will  be well worth the money. My one complaint is that it had to end. I  sincerely hope that Mike writes another -- how about some reviews of  &quot;Overboard&quot; and &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot;, along with a  scathing commentary on the works of the uber mono-emotion wonder Freddie  Prinze Jr.?	2000-07-12

After book 3, I was hoping that the next in the Harry Potter series would re-invigorate the series. While &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; was a good book, it seemed that there was a definite formula developing that was  making Harry's adventures less exciting. Well, I'm happy to say that  &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; lived up to my  expectations! Even the book cover lets you know that J.K. Rowling is going  to shake things up at the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. I  won't reveal too many details, but in this one Harry faces his biggest  challenge(s) yet! While the book is not overtly scary I guess parents  should be warned that it is, so far at least, the darkest of the series -  and Harry is forced to face some pretty grim situations and upsetting  consequences. But I don't think it's anything a kid couldn't handle,  especially since the lessons Harry learns are ones that we all must face  sooner or later. As with the rest of the series, I would highly reccomend  that parents read this book out loud to their children. Harry's adventures  are one of those  rare feats that truly can involve all age groups equally.  And, as someone who very fondly remembers the nights when my father used to  read to my sisters and I, I can assure you that this is exactly the sort of  thing that we would have loved to have shared.	2000-07-12

I especially liked the beginning, with all the accounts of the most beautiful women in the world. The ending is also enjoyable and exciting. But when you're wading through everything else  nothing can compare to the movie. I can see why many may dismiss the movie  as cheesy, but it's one of those things that is so bad it's good. And it is  involving and exciting, and the humor is a lot more prevalent than it is in  the book. I got bored halfway through the book. I don't know why - the  movie and book are very similar. But the author's interruptions annoyed me  after a while - they were never as entertaining as the scenes with Fred  Savage and the grandfather in the movie. And while it was nice to get more  behind-the-scenes information (i.e. what happens when Inigo and Fezzik wake  up after being beaten by Westley). But in the end I only realized why that  was cut from the movie; it's not really necessary to further the story, and  remains more interesting without it. Anyway, it is worth reading,  especially if you're a fan of the movie.	2000-07-06

And yet it is rare for a book to truly capture the pain and awkwardness that is our teen years. &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot; is one of those rare  exceptions. It's about a guy who writes letters to an unknown person under  the pseudonym Charlie. Through his letters Charlie finds a release from the  pressure of his freshman year of high school. And while occasionally his  observations seem a little contrived or like after-school special cliches,  he remains the most fully realized and realistic fictional character since  Holden Caulfield. I could really identify with a lot of what happens in  this book, and I think other people would too. I really enjoyed this book a  lot. And it's a fast read, so it's good for anyone just looking for a good,  quick book to read.	2000-06-29

But after a while the prose gets annoying, you can only take so much  of it before it gets tired. I saw the movie first (which I reccomend doing,  because it helped me from getting too frustrated), and I expected it to be  different. I just didn't realize that it would be THIS different. John  Irving must have realized that the subplots were pointless and barely  interesting (particularly Melony's, especially considering that her lasting  effect comes after Homer has already made his decision). The movie  eliminates them, and flows all the better for it. And the movie gets rid of  a lot of the plot twists that make the book seem like a ludicrous soap  opera (i.e. Angel, Homer's love child with Candy). The characters aren't  very likeable, either. Even those who start out nicely become too arrogant  (Dr. Larch), obnoxious (Wally), or Wimpy (Homer and Candy - who spends the  entire book refusing to make decisions). I guess what I'm trying to say is  that I think you should see the movie instead of struggling through this  too long, too convoluted book that loses its charm all too quickly.	2000-06-18

I breezed through it in practically no time - and Kaysen's writing makes it an enjoyable trip,  however short. My one complaint is that it seemed to go a little too fast.  We know plenty about Kaysen by the end of the book, but it is a little  tough piecing out everyone else. We know basic character traits: Lisa is  the proud sociopath, Daisy is obsessed with chicken and laxatives, etc. But  we don't get a deeper sense of who they are. The focus of the book is  obviously Kaysen herself, but it would be nice to know more about the  people she spent her time in the mental institution with. Also, changes in  Kaysen's life happen with too little explanation (suddenly she's free,  etc.), and time is a little out of order, so it gets confusing when in one  chapter someone leaves and in the next they're back in a conversation. But  I'm being picky - it is a very good book and those are its only faults. So  I do definitely reccomend it - especially if you are looking for a nice,  quick read.	2000-05-24

It's like Roald Dahl meets Goya. Each story is wondeful and humorous (if you have the right sense of humor for it). But I think it's the illustrations that make this  book so great. They fit the stories so well. I particularly like the ones  in &quot;Staring Girl&quot;. They make you laugh, but they also make you  feel for the characters. If you are a Tim Burton fan this book is  definitely for you, but if not the humor will be lost.	2000-05-05

After introducing us to Harry Potter and his new life at the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry author J.K. Rowling is able to expand on her idea. In &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot; she had to spend a lot of time getting us accustomed to Harry's world, but now we can enjoy it along with  a richer plot and more developed narrative and characters. And what a plot!  I was under the impression that these were completely dumbed down, G-rated  kid-friendly books but there is a definite dark side to them. It's nothing  that will give kids nightmares or anything, but it is a little creepy. I  couldn't put it down I was so drawn in, and finished it easily the first  day I got it. It's very hard to pull yourself away from. I think that if  you are a parent you should read these books aloud to your children. Some  of my most cherished childhood memories are my father reading to us, and  this is the sort of book that we would have loved. You will enjoy it on  your own, but I imagine that it would be a more fulfilling experience  shared with the whole family.	2000-04-24

Don't get me wrong, this is a good book - and definitely worth reading  - but it loses something. How many times is Harry Potter going to sneak out  of the dormitory/school and not get expelled? It seems like he is  constantly letting Gryffindor down only to triumph in the end. I hope that  book 4 revitalizes the series, because I would hate to see such a wonderful  thing get bogged down in formula and cliche. And I didn't really like the  ending. It's a bit confusing and seems to be trying too hard. But the very  end comes back a bit and leaves you with a satisfied feeling - so all we  have to do now is wait impatiently for book 4.	2000-04-24

As an avid Harry Potter fan since 1998, I have reread each book in the series several times.  But when I returned to school two years ago I found myself revisiting the series with less regularity than I had in the past.  That changed this summer when I made it my goal to reread the entire series before the release of \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\\", the final book in the seven-part series.  I am so glad that this time I decided to start at the beginning instead of just rereading the preceding book as I did for the release of \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" because I had almost forgotten how clever and enjoyable the early installments were.  While it is true that \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\" is the most childish of the series, it possesses an enormous amount of charm and intelligence that, along with Rowling's signature creative energy, introduces a fantastic world that even the hardest-hearted of readers would long to belong to.<br /><br />It is every person's wish to be extraordinary, and that dream becomes reality for Harry Potter on his eleventh birthday, when he  meets a friendly half-giant named Hagrid who announces that not only is Harry a wizard, but one of the most famous people in the wizarding world.  At the tender age of one Harry somehow managed to defeat Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard so powerful that the mere mention of his name is enough to terrify the magical community.  His parents were killed in the attack and Harry was left with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead.  But some, including Harry's new headmaster, Professor Dumbledore, believe that Voldemort will return one day - and Harry's first year at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry becomes proof positive that the dark lord is trying to return with a vengeance.<br /><br />So begins an epic battle between good and evil that will surely stand the test of time alongside such other juggernauts as \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\".  As the series progresses the subject matter becomes darker and the political commentary more pointed, giving the books the realistic perspective of a boy growing up, learning to see the world for what it is, coming to terms with the weight of his destiny, and embracing goodness and bravery over cowardice and greed.<br /><br />It all begins right here ... so what are you waiting for?

After the less plot-driven &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot; I didn't expect  anything dense, and was surprised by the attention to plot and development.  But now that Rowling has introduced us to Harry's world she has free reign  to gloss over the details and follow a single plotline. And what a  plotline! I expected these books to be childish, but this one is actually  creepy. When several students are petrified and a mysterious message  proclaiming the chamber of secrets has been opened appears Harry must find  the culprit before his friend Hermione is the next victim. It sounds  vaguely  like an episode of Scooby Doo - but trust me, it's not. I couldn't  put it down once I had started it, and found myself staying up until four  in the morning to finish it the same day I got it. My only complaint is  that it had to end.

I was unsure of what it was until I saw another review (the one by Amy of Colorado). Tom is never really in danger of being found out: everyone  around him is so stupid and self-involved that only one person even  suspects a thing (and Tom takes care of that rather quickly). Tom's  character desperately needed a match - an antagonist (if you can call Tom  the hero) worthy of his skill. While the movie is very different, the two  function well together. Each offers what the other is missing (although the  book allows a deeper understanding of Tom, which helps a lot). All in all,  it's worth reading.	2000-02-12

It has an incredibly imaginative plot, and does a good job building suspense. Each time line is handled well, and when they all  &quot;de-rail&quot; Peter David must be given credit for seamlessly  blending their qualities. This book is good even if you don't like Star  Trek thanks to a somewhat universal plot, but it would help if you've seen  The Next Generation because some elements relate to details of the  character's pasts and things that happened in an episode. I reccomend it if  you like Star Trek or science fiction in general.	2000-01-22

In other words - it's a great book for anyone.	1999-12-16

Never in my life have I read a book where I could almost hear what the main character was thinking. Holden Caulfield is the most extraordinarily developed character I've ever read. It is impossible not to relate to him -  he is the ultimate example for what it is like to be a teenager and unsure  of where your life is headed. You must read this book!	1999-12-16
