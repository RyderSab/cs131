BEL CANTO is still one of the most unique and surprisingly plausible storylines I have ever enjoyed.<br /><br />All in all I gave TRUTH AND BEAUTY 4.5 stars in my reading journal, there were times, I was saying in my mind 3.75, but then Patchett sends me off on another high, and I change my mind, showing the depth and breadth of her ability to move the reader and his reading experience to multiple levels. It was more of a biography of Lucy Grealy, the poet and author, than I expected. Though just when I was starving for a drop of info about Patchett she threw me a bone, and the tide turned, surprising me once again.<br /><br />I found Lucy to be self absorbed and manipulative, though it is hard not to care about her, love her would be too strong a phrase. I see the roots of this behavior in her illness and formative years. No Spoiler... she was a survivor of cancer of her jawbone as a child, exstensive radiation left her disfigured. Her book is titled, AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A FACE. Being Lucy's friend was all consuming. She absorbed people into her world like a dried-out sponge in need of water, placing herself in the center of their lives, a place most of her friends and certainly Patchett were most happy to be.<br /><br />Patchett writes about Lucy with a multidimensional view that has the reader right there and engrossed by Lucy's world one minute and resenting her the next, but always with a true affection. I can't state that strongly enough. She writes with complete honesty, straight from her heart; that's what I found so striking. She pulled me back in when I didn't always like what Lucy was doing.<br /><br />Lucy had suffered stoically through many surgeries in her short lifetime. Some that were experimental and painful beyond belief. Patchett showed the heart of a tiger with her cub in the care of Lucy. This book has generated a lot of thought on my part. I thank the author for that. It has brought up important feelings geared towards myself as an ER nurse where I walk the fine line of Empathy vs. Sympathy. I can never forget that that is someone's loved one in the bed, and though I can't be crushed by their pain and suffering (I would be useless in my job), I can always make a difference in their comfort, even a small one, no matter how busy or short staffed we may be.<br /><br />A note about listening to the CD or book on tape. The author reads the book herself. I have two thoughts on this. At times it is beneficial to hear the author read the material because she interprets what she has written with her inflections on certain phrases and moments, and the reading comes across in such a way that might sound completely different from someone else. The down side of this reading is that other than those moments, her voice drones on with no enthusiasm. After listening to 100's of books on tape I find that actors seem to give you a different feeling. It is a performance and pulls the listener in much more. That is the missing factor here. Don't let that deter you in any way though, all in all it is very interesting book and well worth the read.....Deniset has brought up important feelings geared towards myself as an ER nurse where I walk the fine line of Empathy vs. Sympathy.

After finishing this book I feel compelled to share it with every reader I know. I have sent copies to my friends, and family, as well as shared it with my reading groups at work and on line.<br />The story begins in Afghanistan in the 1970's.  Amir remembers his childhood as a benevolent string of happy days, childhood memories that last a lifetime. It is this part of the book that I enjoyed through the author's eyes. Today we see Afghanistan as the war torn land depicted on the evening news, to read of the early days through the eyes of Hosseini is a delight. The joy and love for his native country literally pours out, to fill the pages with his memories of a country filled with beautiful, hospitable, and kind people.<br />Amir's friendship with a young servant boy is pivotal to the story, as a horrific event changes their relationship forever, thus effecting Amir's life in a way that he never expects. The political climate changes, and he flees to the USA with his father, where he learns to let his guilt simmer in the back of his mind. It is many years later when he is called back to Afghanistan, and comes face to face with the outcome of the betrayal, along with it's reciprocating factors.<br />The Taliban is entrenched in a country filled with all too many citizens that live in fear. The beauty he once knew is covered by rubble. As Amir follows the path that was set in motion decades prior, the reader can't help but feel totally immersed in his plight. I will give no more away, but promise you an end that is a touching portrayal of hope and justice.<br />Kudo's to this author who in his first book has given us a novel that fills the reader with a longing for more. He is a force to be reckoned with and worth watching....Kelsana 5/9/2004	2004-05-09

I just enjoy good fiction, written well, with a smooth rythm of story progression, and characters I love and care about. Add a thriller aspect that leaves the reader turning the pages as fast as they can, and you have a great book.<br />I won't make this a political statement. It is just one man's version of a possibility. If anything, it will make the believers cautious, perhaps ask a few more questions, and that can't hurt.<br />Allison Turk has come to China to adopt a baby, and because of an unknown glitch the officials have requested she turn the baby over to officials, and a new baby will be forthcoming. Allison who has bonded with the child decides to take matters into her own hands, along with her 9 year old step-son Tyler, she makes a run for it. Her journey is nothing short of remarkarkable.<br />The story culminates in moments as montrous as the imagination could devise. Just what is going on with the unwanted children in China? Is there any truth in it? I don't know, but the story caught me up in it's momentum from start to finish...Kelsana	2004-05-01

I recently picked up this book and was so taken by the storyline I finished it in a day. The author has created honest characters that the reader genuinely cares about.<br />The setting is a ranch outside of LA, used as a set for Hollywood projects. Sammie, the female protaganist, works as a medical assistant whose job discription surpasses expectations at a medical clinic, staffed to care for the many people who live on, and visit the Ranch to work. Sammie meets the love of her life and the story takes off from there, but everything is not as it seems, and the author has a few unexpected surprises.<br />The loyalty and friendships in the book invoke a heartwarming quality that keeps you rooting for these people through their ups and downs. You will want more once the story ends.<br />The second book in the Trilogy is called MALLOTT MEADOW, followed by the third book titled THE KEY. If you are looking for a bit of sentiment, and characters you will think about long after, this book won't disappoint.	2004-04-30

Marcia Willett is a new author for me. Popular in the United Kingdom it has been a joy to find this book in the USA. Reminiscent of a Rosamunde Pilcher novel, owing to the simple comfort brought to the reader who picks this book up. The characters have the breath of life in them, and wind themselves around the heart of the reader where they stay long after.<br />Maudie has come to a point that she must sell Moorgate, as much as it will dampen her spirit to let it go, she must. The man that she has hired to refurbish the old house has fallen in love with it after putting his heart and soul into the work he has done, it is almost to much to bear to see it go to a stranger. One perfect week in winter will change the course of the future for all involved as well as the beautiful lady called \\"Moorgate\\".<br />This is only the beginning of a wonderfully told tale about love, life, secrets and the relationships that sustain and very possibly degrade. It is a superbly written work of fiction that will comfort and seize the attention of anyone lucky enough to come across it...	2002-09-12

I could not put this book down. I was able to read it in one night and I feel totally capable of walking into a jewelry store and buying a diamond with the knowledge that I'm not getting ripped off. He has even added checklists for choosing your perfect diamond and picking a reputable jeweler. The only thing I found missing were pictures of different things to look for, such as diamonds that have been laser treated, the color scales, kinds of inclusions and blemishes as they look under a 10X loupe which is the instrument used to detect defects in a diamond. It is a good book as an adjunct to other books that might not be as easily read and clear in the technical presentation.	2002-09-07

A gifted opera singer, Roxanne Coss, is hired to sing at an international get together for a Japanese businessman, in an obscure third world country. An unexpected terrorist attack leaves them hostages in the prestigious home of the vice-president. This is the premise of Ann Patchett's incredible study of human nature. Humans are basically gregarious animals and will search out comfort no matter what the situation. Add haunting music and the illustrious voice of an angel, and they all have something in common. The music flows through them, as the bonds grow between captive and captor. We can only imagine the ending to the pre-destined cataclysmic event that is bound to occur.<br />Patchett's writing blossoms throughout this novel filled with unusual relationships that she is able to describe so vividly. She has taken an international group of people with differing cultures and religious backgrounds, add in multiple language skills that leave the interpreter dizzy, and what do we unexpectedly arrive a.... but harmony. Something is to be said for the ability of humans to see the good in any given situation. Her development of the characters is superb leaving little to the imagination as to their joys and frustrations. I say \\"Bravo\\" for one of the best books I have read this year.

He gallantly approaches Australia and it's inhabitants with an open mind and heart that spills over into his writing.<br />This book is the product of a bittersweet mixture of facts, statistics, and observations made during his wanderings about this vast continent. Bryson is quick to enjoy the simplest pleasures and chat up the locals with an ease that makes him likable to the people he meets as well as the reader. To put it in his words, this is a continent \\"packed with unappreciated wonders\\", and his writing places us right in the middle of it all.<br />I picked up this book after reading A WALK IN THE WOODS which was another excellent choice by this author.

The author, who teaches in San Francisco, and spends her summers along with her husband Ed in their home in Tuscany started the transformation on their Tuscan home with a fervor that actually pulses, she is so talented in bringing it to life for the reader.<br />Mayes has found her heart and home in the Tuscan countryside. Throughout the reading of this book, I felt the whimsical need to become a part of her adventure. She lifted me away to take part in this magnificent venture of finding the perfect house, followed by a renovation that uncovers a hidden fresco covered by white wash years before. History sings out with every turn of the shovel as the land is cleared and the olive trees are trimmed. We are also taken on a tour of the area and it's many churches. Throughout the book the Italian people are introduced like slices of life and imaginings on the part of the author, because she quickly admits she is not knowledgable in many areas but  is just finding her way.<br />Mayes is a connoisseur of food and is quick to explain that cooking is a &quot;destiny&quot; in her family.

I was so taken by the life story of Ida Lewis and her many rescues in the harbor at Newport Rhode Island I could not put it down. I grew up in the area and I can't imagine how her very existence was unknown to me, until I was so lucky as to pick up this book in passing.<br />The first woman lighthouse keeper, she made her first rescue at the age of 15 while living on Lime Rock with her family. Weighing all of 103 pounds her 18 documented feats of bravery over the years were nothing short of a miracle. Her modesty in the face of the attention showered upon her was a sight to behold. She was a woman with a purpose and the safety of the voyagers in her realm was of the utmost priority.<br />In her lifetime her notoriety would bring even presidents to her rock in the harbor.  At the age of 69, bureaucracy and a changing world of technology would shake the core of Ida's ways, upsetting her lifelong endeavors of keeping the light, and bringing things to an end for her.  This was an inspiring book and extremely well researched. The author was diligent in searching out and documenting her sources, since Ida was not one to keep a journal. Where there was any question Skomal is quick to explain how she arrived at the material that she chose to include in the book.. Kelsana 7/31/02	2002-07-31

In her teens she was raped by a friend of her father, setting her painting on a course that showed not only Rome and Italy, but a world of pain as well as the strength she emanated. Her paintings wreak havoc on the senses. Her women are portrayed as independent and strong, something unheard of in this period. She was the first woman to be recognized in the male dominated world of art.<br />Artemisia spends time with Galileo, an apt pupil to his musings on the theory that the Earth orbits around the sun, a blasphemous idea at the time, for which Galileo was placed under house arrest. He found her to have a meditative mind with a different perspective. She was a woman with vision and was admitted to the Academy of Sciences in Florence, an unprecedented happening for a female painter.<br />This book is beautifully written. It is a story of healing and forgiveness. Her relationships with her father, daughter and even the husband that is so often absent are developed to perfection. This is a fictitious account of her life and should be read as such. Another book that I enjoyed by this author is GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE.  Kelsana 7/23/02	2002-07-24

A decidedly drawn vision of vanishing America, along with a way of life that is being swallowed up by an economic revival that leaves out the very individuals that ushered it in. Their lack of marketable skills for the up and coming times gives them a sense of uselessness in the era to come.<br />This story is more than the economic downfall of a town, it is the many people that incorporate its value's, meshed together they present a story that positively wraps itself around the reader and pulls them in. Miles, dedicated dad and would-be proprietor of the Empire Grill (if only Mrs. Whiting would see fit to pass), is wracked with guilt over what should have been. Though a bit late, and at the age of 42, this is his coming of age story.<br />He is surrounded by a cast of characters that include Tick his teenage daughter who is wise beyond her years, her mom Janine who has fallen out of love with Miles, and into the arms of \\"The Silver Fox\\", and my favorite her grandfather the Machiavellian Max, a mooch with cheese puffs in his beard.<br />The story takes an unexpected dark turn as the plot thickens. If you are lucky enough to listen to the book on tape there is an interview with the author where he speaks of his many sleepless nights while writing this book. As the story unfolded it became \\"one long night sweat\\" says Russo. He knew what was coming, and its intensity on a daily basis as he worked on the book grated on his sensibility.<br />This was a gripping piece of fiction from an author that writes not only novels but successful screenplays. He is a force to be reckoned with and an author worth watching.  Kelsana  7/17/02	2002-07-17

An interesting look at the 33rd president of the United States, an ordinary man of the people who shaped history, and this country, with his forthright attitude and convictions.<br />McCullough brings forth the true nature of the man who would be president when the atom bombs were dropped on Japan. He would stand over the creation of the United Nations, the Berlin Airlift, and an Israeli State. He was a man who held out for peace against a warmonger General, who would have invaded China, and could have very possibly been responsible for bringing the USA into a third world war.<br />Truman's decisions were not always popular, but in the long run they were proven to be solid. He was not a man who thrived on fame and recognition; he saw the presidency as a privilege and a job that he would give his all for. A private man with middle class working values he would continue to help the Democratic Party till his dying days.<br />I picked up this book after reading this author's much-acclaimed book titled JOHN ADAMS. I found Truman to be less introspective and personal. It was written more like a history book. There was little mention of the intimacy shared between Harry and Bess, a strong point that brought out the humanity found in the telling of John Adams and Abigail's part in history. I have also been lucky enough to pick up some of the great movies that this author has been a part of writing and producing. He has several works pertaining to the Civil War.

It is when she returns to the scene that trouble starts to erupt in our group of thirty-somethings. We are about to find out everyone's secrets and some of them just might be unexpected.<br />I laughed, I cried, and I felt the tender heart of the author's hand while reading this book. It runs the full gamut of emotions. Green deals with the implications of social acceptance and behavior on a grand scale, safe sex and relationships in a time of changing attitudes, and betrayal and renewal that leads to a need for closure. This book was much more than I expected. If you enjoy this book, JEMIMA J is another great book by this author. Kelsana 7/03/02	2002-07-03

Miss Hanff, a writer of TV scripts, writes her first letter to Marks &amp; Company Booksellers in search of rare books.

The story goes on to show you the inner personalities of the characters, devious as well as amusing.<br />The problem I had with this book is I found myself disliking not only the main character, but most of the secondary characters as well.

Now this could be my personal taste, and this is only my opinion, but I like to see what I think are the important aspects of a book come to fruition.<br />I know several people who enjoyed this book and have passed it on in good grace but for me it was average in every way, and not hard to put down.

Mason's writing is verbose to the point of illustrious, filled with foreshadowing fed to the reader like so many breadcrumbs discarded along a path, leading us to one unexpected twist after another. The story unravels slowly, not at the breakneck pace of the usual page-turner, but with an expressive usage of language that is reminiscent of Bronte and Austen.<br />The story begins with the protagonist telling the reader that he has killed his wife of 45 years, but for all intent and purposes it is believed to be a suicide. It is the story of a man who lived his life in a prison of his own making. A moment of transparency in his carefully constructed life has led him to look back on the choices that brought him to this point.There are events buried deep within that are just too terrible to face. The unspoken compact that has held him fast and firm through life is about to come to light, and the results are yet to be determined.<br />I enjoyed this book immensely but I have to say it was the writing style that really caught my attention. This is not your usual cookie cutter mystery story. This is an excellent book from a writer that I'm sure you will hear more from in the future.  Kelsana  6/19/02	2002-06-19

McCulloch brings his subject to the forefront of the revolution and beyond, with a personal account formed from letters and personal journals kept by some of the greatest and most influential men and women of this blossoming republic. Starting with the early days when England ruled, and Adams was a member of the Massachusetts bar, where he was remembered for his part in the defense of the British soldiers after the Boston Massacre. Though this affected his popularity in a negative way, Adams believed that all men had the right to a defense. His strict countenance to abide by what is just and good would serve him well in later years, where his heartfelt pleas for independence in 1776 were part of what made this nation great. Adams oration on the floor in Philadelphia moved men's souls setting the stage for one of the greatest dramas in history, the American Revolution.<br />The writings of his wife Abigail Adams permeate the piece, an intelligent and eloquent woman, John thought of her not only as his friend and lover, but also as his equal. She stood faithfully by his side, and deserves to be remembered for her steadfast support of Adams on his mission to move this great nation forward. It was the sections where Abigail came to light that made this book more than a book of history, it brought a sense of humanity to the subject that is easier to understand on the readers level, since the things that these men were a part of were so great, and far beyond the undertakings of our daily lives. It is John and Abigail together that made him real for me.<br />The friendship between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams is a large part of this book. Presented again through letters they shared and journal entries; there were times when their politics differed and their friendship lagged. In their later years they were to make amends and become great friends, writing and discussing the state of the nation as well as personal news. They would both die on the same day of the same year July 4,1826 the 50th year anniversary of our Independence. This, I found to be quite remarkable.<br />I picked up this book because of its continued ability to grace the New York Times Bestsellers list, almost expecting a fairly dry account of one of our founding fathers. I was greatly surprised by the telling of a personal story of greatness, a love story, a passion for learning, strength, and belief in the American way, which Adams so graciously helped to put into action for generations to come.

Words are not enough to portray the emotion packed into the telling of Zoya's Story. Brought up with parents who believed in education, democracy, human rights, feminism, and above all a mother deeply involved in \\"The Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan\\", also known as RAWA, Zoya's story begins as a young child in the city of Kabul. We follow her earlier days through the Russian occupation, then the Mujahideen of the Northern Alliance, made up of warlords that raped and murdered their own people, and finally through the insanity of the Taliban, a perverse adherence to nothing that even slightly resembles the teachings of Mohammed and the pronouncements made in the Koran, where women became something to be hidden, not to laugh or voice a word.<br />Zoya was educated and cared for by RAWA and by the age of 16 became an active member in this organization that reaches out to thousands of Afghan women, supporting them financially, educationally, and psychologically. Though only 23 years of age at the telling of this story, Zoya has lived far more than a lifetime. Her patriotism runs so deep it will wrench your heart. She believes that the future of her beloved Afghanistan lies in the intellects and hearts of the children, at any cost they must be educated so they can meet the needs of a democratic society in the future. Small groups of children are hidden away in safe houses where they are educated, in a country where it is in threat of death for a woman to learn and the only lessons to be given are study of the Koran.<br />I was appalled by the atrocities, unspeakable tortures, and hatred put forth in the name of religion and suffered by the Afghan people under the reign of the fundamentalists. Yet I was strengthened by the knowledge that there are educated people working diligently to return this country to a well-deserved peace after years of unjustifiable war at the hands of those men in power. May Allah grant their prayers and smile down upon them.<br />This was truly one of the best books I ever read. Accurate, and filled with a candor that leaves you with a need to do something to make this world just a little bit better. Most of all it made me realize, I should be thankful every day of my life for the freedom I have as an American.  Kelsana  6/10/02.<br />This was truly one of the best books I ever read.

During one of the breaks we started a discussion about this book he had written, filled with his own creative recipes for Portabella Mushrooms.<br />Mr. Brown exudes passion, and after trying some of his recipes I can clearly see why. His goal is to educate people to the pleasure and flavor these mushrooms hold. I never realized how good they could be, and I thank him for his book and his directions.<br />The illustrations that accompany each recipe are colorful and pleasing to the eye. Most important of all the recipes are simple to put together with ingredients that most of us have around the house. At the center of each recipe is the tantalizing taste of the Portabella mushroom a flavor that borders on meaty, and nothing less than fulfilling.<br />Mr. Brown BBQ's, saut&eacute;s and broils the portabellas, in the many recipes which include flavors as diverse as Cajun, Asian, Italian, and Mexican. The opening pages offer some great tips along with general information in preparation and nutrition.

Cleage writes with an intelligent edge about a modern day black woman, Joyce Mitchell, who has gravitated towards teaching those less fortunate than herself how to promote themselves to be free women. The girls meet at the \\"Sewing Circus\\" their affectionate name for the gathering place. With a sense of distinction Joyce is there through the ups and downs of their daily lives, always ready with a cup of tea and an ear to listen as she helps her friends along. But life has something special in mind for Joyce; someone spectacular is about to walk into her lonely life.<br />Smoothly written with a rhythm that undulates from each and every chapter, our protagonist Joyce, not only finds delight in the strong black woman she is, she is able to share that ability with those that might have never had a chance to grasp a brighter future.<br />Cleage is also the bestselling author of WHAT LOOKS LIKE CRAZY ON AN ORDINARY DAY. She brings a strong sense of heritage to her writing. This book makes a fervent statement. I found it well worth the time.  Kelsana 5/14/02	2002-05-15

How clearly Hepinstall writes of a mother, too weak to stand up for her own children, a women who lives in a world of her own making, where her children are trapped by the preponderance of the chosen maniac.<br />As I read this book it started to roll away from me like a freight train in high gear.

Remarkably you find yourself cheering on the heroines as they make political and social statements that shake up the standards. The characters are as clearly cut as glass and I found myself laughing as well as crying as the story unfolded. It all culminates in the last 100 pages where I felt like I was in a rowboat headed for the falls at break neck speed.<br />I picked up this book thinking this was a light read, the cover struck me as chick lit, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it was a total package with a great deal to say...	2002-05-09

Told in the first person, by a man named Pilot after his father's love of flying; we are entrenched in the bizarre happenings of a family gone awry. We meet Pilot, who is a paranoid schizophrenic, right after he has suffered a psychotic event, where he believes he remembers what happened to his sister Fiona who disappeared at the age of seven.<br />The book takes off in several directions leaving the reader wondering what is real, and what is the meandering mind of a psychotic. His mother tells us in the first paragraph that she is seeing ghosts. Pilot's brother Eric is a neurosurgeon that seems to deal with it all quite calmly and efficiently. Their father is out of the picture but that is still yet another slice of the story to be dealt with.<br />The author does a superb job of climbing inside the chaotic mind of someone who is deranged, but all is not always as it seems. There are many characters on the stage set by this novel, and there are several suspects. The truth is so gruesome it is not for the faint of heart. I found this book unnerving, but I also could not stop listening to it.  Kelsana 5/8/02	2002-05-08

The author has created some richly illuminated, strong, and intelligent characters. Poppy makes us realize how much joy there is in the everyday sights, sounds, and smells of living. He was by far my favorite character.<br />The book takes time to get going since the strong point is the development of the characters.

Written by a natural born storyteller, MacDonald allows the reader to amble through the insanity that becomes the Piper family. We trip through the abuse, lust, neglect, alcoholism, homosexuality, and the many lies that keep the truth buried so deep, no one will ever unravel fact from fiction. A twisted tale of survivors as well as those that are annihilated by the insanity of a family that continues on at all costs. The prices paid are astronomical when measured against the joys reaped.<br />This is an intense book, marked by a profundity that keeps the reader aware of the sadness that permeates the writing. Writing where the description of even the joyful moments, which are all too few, has an element of sadness shadowing it. At times it became quite difficult for me to read, the story telling was that antagonizing, pulling the reader along like a whirlpool of exasperation, never knowing what would surface.

Through the ups and downs of marriage and the childbearing years they always know they have each other. Until something unspeakable happens, something so unthinkable they are not sure whether it is even possible.<br />I climbed right into this novel and became one of the \\"Grand Dames\\" of Grand Avenue, as they were so richly known.

When I became ensconced comfortably in a plausible scenario, honestly believing I had finally figured things out, the author ripped the rug out from under my feet and hit me with the finale. I still shake my head at the outcome.<br /><br />This books reads so fast you hardly have time to hold the pages as they breeze by. When I was away from it I couldn't wait to get back to it.

There are more twists and turns in this book then on the track of the Indy 500 speedway.<br />The author strikes out at the reader with the fundamental, basic emotions of envy, revenge, and hard won justice, key elements that take the reader on a roller coaster ride that leads them to the grand finale ending. There are some sexually explicit words and scenes, for those who are easily offended take note. All in all I would give this book 4.5 stars.  Kelsana 3/27/02	2002-03-27

Sudha has come to America from Calcutta to make a new life for herself and her baby daughter Dayita. She finds herself in a cramped apartment with her cousin and Anju's husband Sunil who has always loved her from afar. The story though a bit sparse and predictable was tantalizing just the same. The author has a knack for making the cultural expectations clear while letting us feel the disappointments and joys that each character is faced with in this new and changing environment.<br />Interspersed among the chapters are letters and essays along with a very original way of showing conversation with the unsaid thoughts behind the words that give us insight into the feelings and needs that make the characters what they are.

Becky has some of the best rationalization skills when it comes to her needs, or should I say wants. She will have you laughing all the way to the bank a place her money never seems to end up.<br />This follow up book to Kinsella's debut novel CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC is a wonderful piece of light hearted banter with a main character that leaves you wanting to shake some sense into her, while her heart of gold makes her contagious to a fault. The problem with Becky is she just can't say no, not only to spending, but also to people and their demands. This fault in her character leads her into some hysterically tight spots.<br />This light-hearted read packs a punch on the humor Richter scale. I promise it will keep you smiling long after the fact. Kelsana 1/31/02	2002-01-31

The beginning of this book packs a punch that will take your breath away as Darden, one of O.J.'s prosecutors, personally addresses the man he believes to be a savage murderer, and he holds back nothing. Speaking in a tone that tells O.J. he knows just what happened, how he watched Nicole that night from outside the window as she lit the candles around the tub, a ritual the two of them enjoyed together, but not anymore. He bludgeons O.J. with his words as he describes the rage he must have felt to know she had other lovers. Then he goes on to describe the frenzied murder that left Nicole's neck severed to the spinal cord and how an innocent Goldman showed up at the most inopportune time. It left me chilled.<br />This book is filled with facts. Indisputable facts that will leave you wondering how a murderer walked free. Darden goes into the race card played by Johnnie Cochran and how it threw all chances for justice away, leaving a jury that made a disastrous decision in a matter of minutes. This is a most enlightening book that paints a clear picture of the hours of testimony. The day the verdict was announced in court was the last day Darden would stand before a jury. He has now taken a teaching position where he can share his brilliance with those not yet tainted by the system.  Kelsana  1/29/02	2002-01-30

The Story begins with Holden Caulfield's fourth dismissal from an all-boys prep school. From beginning to end he lacks direction yet in his own scrambled way he is searching for answers.<br />Again and again he rambles on about how depressed and bored he is. Continuously complaining that he is surrounded by phonies; his banter goes off on tangents that never seem to lead him to any solutions. Holden reminded me of a teenager with Attention Deficit Disorder who when given solutions couldn't seem to process them.<br />The redeeming part of this book was Holden's relationship with his sister Phoebe. Younger than Holden, she seemed to have more direction and sense than he has ever had. I liked his affectionate name for her, \\"old Phoebe\\". The tie in to the title was an interesting aspect of Holden's personality. In his dreams he saw himself as standing guard on the edge of a field of rye, catching all the children who were about to fall over the edge. Similar to his outlook in life where he seemed to protect those that were in need.<br />I know to some this book brings back fond memories of days long past, and a coming of age story that has lasted throughout the decades, but I don't see what the cult like fascination with it is.

Not always true in this age of court TV and money to buy even the guiltiest person their freedom, but is that anything new, really? Sad but true our justice system has some major flaws, and Dunne is quick to point them out. In this book he covers some of the biggest cases of the last few decades including the O.J. Trial, the Menendez brother's cruel murder of their parents, and the Claus von Bulow Case in Newport, Rhode Island whose prime victim, Sonny his wife, still sadly passes her days in an insulin induced coma. He also poignantly reiterates the trial of his own daughter's murder by an obsessed boyfriend.<br />The book is gripping and hits close to the heart especially when justice seems to be obliterated by the system, and the perpetrator makes out better than the victim. At these times you would beg to change the title to \\"Injustice\\". The one thing that I found difficult is the flow, the author seemed to jump back and forth between cases, All in all it was a very enlightening book. I would give this book 3.5 stars.

A futuristic glance back in time from someone who grew up in the early part of the new Millennium; Jocelyn goes on to tell of wars and race riots that left the face of our country devastated and destroyed for decades after.<br />Entwined within the major plot is the mystery of an evil presence that knows something about Jocelyn and has plans for her.

There is a bit of everything here and it all comes together quite well at the end. The writing is fast paced and quite believable for the future.

Was the physical condition part of Gods plan? How much of it is taken on faith and how is sister John going to deal with the turmoil?<br />I found the insights into the life of a contemplative by the author unbelievably astute. I was amazed at his ability to make the reader understand the strength of their faith, and the wholehearted devotion that some would see as fanaticism with which these women live their lives.

The adventure begins to unfold in a most mysterious way when we find out it is tied to a little girl who has been missing from their Norwegian town for many years.<br />I was lucky enough to listen to the book on tape, and was surprised and happy to find it was narrated by John McDonough who also narrated the Mitford series by Jan Karon. He is most memorable to me as the voice of Father Tim.  Kelsana 12/05/01	2001-12-06

This week John Knowles passed away and took the answer to his grave. Set in an all-boys prep school in New Hampshire during WWII; this classic American novel centers around two young boys coming of age. It is the summer sessions before their senior year when a terrible accident leaves one of the boys crippled for life. The question is was the act perpetrated with malice. Exactly what really happened?<br />A SEPARATE PEACE has been a must read for many high school students for years. After hearing that the author left it to our imaginations I thought how appropriate to allow us to see it from our own point of view. A quick easy read, I read it in a day.

Sophie and Phin soon hook up and the antics begin along with an unsolved murder that is presented in such a comical fashion, you can't help but laugh.

I was in the mood for a good dose of horror and the reviewer at my local bookstore said it was so frightening and evil she had to throw it across the room to get away from it. Now that sounds like quite a read! The reality wasn't quite so exciting and here I am a month later. It soon became very long and drawn out with minimal horror. I was compelled to put the book down, but hardly to throw it across the room for it's evil attributes.<br />Brite is an interesting writer and I might even give her a try again but this book just seemed to take forever to get any place.

A 39 year old woman, and mother of two, screams out \\"wait\\" as she is about to check out of the world as she knows it. When she opens her eyes it's a year later and she is in the body of a 22-year-old addict named Thisby, who has just overdosed.<br />Katherine's journey begins as she tries to sort through her new life. She has a brother and sister who she has yet to meet, as well as a personality like a banshee with a nasty reputation to uphold, or so it is believed.  Her new family is intellectual and named after literary figures. The author plays a game with Shakespearian quotes that is simply brilliant.<br />As her life progresses in this body of Thisby's, she learns more about her real self and what she needs. There are parts of her own childhood that she still needs to face. It is an extraordinary coming of age story written from an entirely different perspective.

The answer will astound and horrify you. Stone, the author of ALL FLOWERS DIE, arrives on the scene with his second book like a locomotive hitting the tracks at full force. You're in for the ride of your life. The reader is led down a dizzying trail of possibilities that leaves us questioning the sanity of the characters as well as the choices they have made.<br />Birdy has a story to tell and his self-imposed loneliness is about to come to an end. He is about to discover the ability to forgive and in doing so he comes face to face with the person he has spent ten years of his life trying to lose. A page-turner with characters that ignite your imagination, so real you can't help but wonder where their lives would go as the book comes to an end.<br />Not only is the story unique in concept, the author excels in his ability to describe the scenes that become so clear, you visualize the streets of Boston like only a native can. His use of similes and metaphors are superb. One of my favorites was his introduction of one of the main characters, Vince, through Birdy's eyes. \\"Eurotrash stood above me. Black tufts of chest hair, like spider legs, crawled out from the top of his sweater....he ran his fingers through his gelled strands, I was reminded of another front-paged story about the Exxon Valdez.\\" Personally I will never forget Vince or Birdy but this description of Vince was so vivid it stood forefront in my mind as the story unfolded.<br />The subject matter, though dark is deeply compelling and you can't help but read on. Stone has been on my list of favorites since I read his first book ALL FLOWERS DIE. He is a talented author that I will search out for many years to come.  Kelsana  11/11/01	2001-11-11

In Alexa he may find a joy and love that he is not quite ready for or capable of.<br />As in all of Pilcher's books there is a plethora of characters, all as important as the next with stories that tie together and make you feel like part of the family.

The families involved are torn apart by cheating spouses, sexual abuse, teenage pregnancy, and drug and alcohol addiction, just to name a few of the hurdles placed along your way through the story.<br />I love how this author ties it all together.

A staunch and uppity \\"Blue Blood\\", the matriarch Mother Hannah, is not quick to take to a southern belle of the French persuasion. Maude with her husband Peter by her side, is going to show these Bostonians her strength for decades to come.<br />The book covers nearly 70 years of her life along with the family and friends that grow close to her heart as well as yours.

A wonderful book that comes together like honey on biscuits with a southern flavor that gives you a glimpse at life on the outer banks of the Carolina's. My first book by this author, it is reminiscent of a Pat Conroy novel.<br />Life sends Susan a few curves, her husband has strayed and the bills are piling up faster than she cares to admit. Her teenage daughter is your average teen, a good kid but a bit wayward at times, the easy repartee between Susan and her daughter was a joy to read. I thoroughly enjoyed how this author writes dialogue.<br />Susan is lucky to have the steadfast support of her sister  who still lives on the island homestead, as she wades through the mire of her life. The storm her life has become is going to get a whole lot worse before there is a calm, but the sail is an eventful and enjoyable one with characters you will remember and enjoy.<br />The writing style is fluid and comfortable. The chapters switching back and forth from the present day to the 1960's when, as children they enjoyed the care of a black woman who has touched their lives forever.

The majority of which are huskies, but there are a few pugs and even dingoes in the group.<br />It is quite clear that hierarchy is what rules the group and that dogs simply want to be with, or part of, the group. This book is touching at times because the love of her animals is so evident and their deaths are so sad. I have to admit that her ability to let them run in the city was not acceptable to my sensibility but the book as a whole was very informative and interesting.  Kelsana  9/24/01	2001-09-24

Melissa Etheridge has always been one to pour her love and sadness out in the raw, pulsing drive of her music, or the crystalline acoustics that so clearly define the despondency she felt as her life unraveled. In this book she explains the emotions behind the lyrics, as she climbs to the top, becoming one of the most respected female artists on the music scene today. The book also covers the life she spent with her partner Julie Cypher and their two children.<br />The many photos delighted me, both professional and candid home shots, interspersed among the chapters. She tells how together, with the help of long time friend David Crosby, she and Julie were able to create an alternative family. Unfortunately things have fallen apart, but Melissa and Julie have back-to-back homes so the children can have some semblance of unity in their lives, even though their mothers have parted. I was touched by her words on page 208, when she talks about the dismantling of their home and life, after their break-up. A hot water tank in the attic broke, and the water just poured down from the ceilings. She writes: &quot;We were moving and our house was crying.&quot;<br />I have to admit it was an odd read, and not like any other book I have ever read but it was interesting and Melissa's honesty was enjoyable. I have to give her credit for following her heart and being strong enough to deal with the repercussions as the world looks on. The best in love and life to you Melissa, you are an incredible individual.  Kelsana  9/14/01	2001-09-13

I personally loved this book and I know for a fact that love like this does exist, if only it could happen to everyone at least once in a lifetime.<br />The style of the book is not only as a diary, but it is laced with short entries about the life of Katie who has been given the diary to read. The majority of the story takes place on Martha's Vineyard, a small island off the coast of Massachusetts. It is the story of a perfect love, a perfect family and everything one could only hope for in life. Patterson is acutely sensitive in his ability to write as a female character telling her story.<br />Without ruining it for the reader I will say that the book is an emotional roller coaster, but a ride I wouldn't have missed for anything. Right from the beginning we are left to wonder why Katie is reading Suzanne's diary and we know that there is much more to this story. Thank you Mr. Patterson for a wonderful book and a loving piece of humanity.  Kelsana 9/8/01	2001-09-08

One of which she has carried quietly over the decades. She is taking a good hard look at her 3 grown children who have not all turned out like a mother might hope for.

The author tells the story of the painting by giving us as an account of each owner, leading us back to its creation. The question in the back of the reader's mind is always whether the artist was actually Vermeer. Intelligently written with a clever use of language and a vast array of interesting characters, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Vreeland will be an author I add to my list of favorites. I would give this book 4.5 stars. Kelsana 8/27/01	2001-08-27

This is the story of an Asian daughter who has long since settled in the USA and her relationship with her Americanized daughter who has never seemed to understand the woman within her mother. It is only after Ruth reads her mothers life story, which has been written down for posterity, that she begins to see the great struggles and difficult life her mother has survived.<br />The story is written with a magical hand and reads like a myth to be passed on and treasured by the family that follows. There are many surprises for Ruth along the way as she continues on her trek, unveiling the source of much that has comes to pass.<br />This is a wonderful book. I was able to listen to it as a book on tape and was highly entertained by the intonation of the voices and accents which made it so real. An excellent choice, I would give this book 4.5 stars.

Historical fiction with a heart, this book is the first of two books that Donati has written chronicling the life of Elizabeth Middleton and Nathaniel Bonner. Elizabeth, a spinster with spunk and a determined air, is about to hit the \\"New World\\" by storm. What she finds in the back woods of upstate New York in the late 1700's is literally Paradise, the small town her father, the judge, has honed from a rustic environment along with a group of frontiersmen and Indians.<br />Elizabeth arrives from England with her brother Julian, amid her staunch crinolines and straight lace ways only to find that life is about to change drastically. Brought up as a part of the Mohawk nation, Nathaniel is about to take her life by storm. Land is a top priority in the new world and there is much to be had by all but our adventure takes a twist when two rivals meet over the ownership of Hidden Wolf Mountain.<br />With a cast of characters that you will never forget, conveniently set in writing at the beginning of the book, along with a map of the region, you are swept along by a novel that rivals the likes of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series. I was completely surprised when Donati included a short excerpt of Jamie and Claire Fraser in the book. We are also given an inside look at the Native American's way of life, their pride in the land and their people and their acceptance of a changing world. Their strength of character and respect for nature's ways is clearly evident in her writing.<br />Reading this book was like a total immersion into another time and place to which I can hardly wait to return. I have already purchased the second book titled DAWN ON A DISTANT SHORE.  Kelsana  8/8/01	2001-08-08

Chris finds himself faced with her disappearance and left to decipher the insanity that her journal has become. He picks up pen and paper and attempts to continue the journal finding a strange comfort in putting his words on paper. As Chris begins his journey there is a transition in the works, but is it enough to save this book, that is the question that only the reader can answer.  Kelsana  8/8/01	2001-08-08

This is a completely light and fun read about the ugly duckling that becomes a swan. There are no heavy ploys here, just a girl gets guy, followed by does girl want guy, and we'll just see about that, type of mentality. It's always fun to see a character blossom especially when she drops a small person, weight wise that is. It might not always be realistic, anyone who has lost weight knows that cravings rear their ugly head at least once in awhile but I found the author delicately and accurately penned the sadness and loneliness that incurs when a persons self esteem is not up to par.<br />I also enjoyed how the narrator let us in on a few secrets along the way, teasing the reader with information that only made me want to read on into the night. I admit that the story got a bit unbelievable at times but it was simply something fun to read and it fits the bill as dependable entertainment.  Kelsana 8/8/01	2001-08-08

In their sixties and vibrant as the day is long these southern ladies solve mysteries and this particular mystery is tied into some of the folk art of their Alabama town. The story is interesting and well written; the conversations between these two sisters are nothing short of superlative. The banter between our ladies is sharp, witty and will leave you amused and laughing.<br />Mary Alice has taken on a job at the mall as Mrs. Claus for the Christmas season and she arrives at Patricia Annes house only to claim that she is a sex slave to her man who has been hired to be Santa at the mall.

Set in Ireland, the copper beech is a formidable an aging tree in front of the Shancarrig schoolhouse. Carved into it's bark are the hopes and dreams, stories and well wishes of many a heart, heavy as well as happy, that has passed beneath it's massive branches.<br />The book is written in a way so as to introduce each character and his personal view of Shancarrig and the people in it. This technique allows the lives of the characters to mesh unequivocally making this story so enjoyable. You will meet them all. The scoundrels as well as the lovelorn, those searching for passion, and those who have taken a bite from the apple of life only to be dealt a blow that redirects them to an unprecedented ending.<br />I enjoyed the style of this book as much as the characters and the storylines.

The beguiling story of a youth who comes to live with family long forgotten; he is initiated into this house of confusing characters and ghosts that haunt the past as well as the present.<br />Capote's talent lies in his ability to make you feel the warm, muggy southern breeze upon your throat as he wraps it around your very body. He writes of his south like a man possessed and enthralled with the life that abides there. At times the story tends to wander and for that I would give it a 3.5 but for all intents and purposes it is entirely unforgettable.  Kelsana  7/24/01	2001-07-24

We watch them attempt to bloom like so many different flowers, and enjoy their trials and tribulations as well as their ability to conquer their ignorance when given half a chance.

I have to explain that I think this is a wonderful book but I wish the title did it justice. It is the story of an intelligent, witty and savvy woman who finds herself dealing with old baggage, and future difficulties that would shake even the solidly sane to their knees.<br />Cannie Shapiro has taken a break from her boyfriend Bruce of three years, when she finds he has written a column in a magazine depicting their time spent together, and to top it all off he has mentioned her slightly large form in the telling. The title of the column just happens to be &#8220;Good in Bed&#8221;. After being rightfully shamed and faced with Bruce&#8217;s lack of sensitivity we follow her through the trials and tribulations of the aftermath. Along with her misplaced love life, she has a mom who has realized at the age of 56 that she is a lesbian and has taken on a lover. The scenarios are endlessly amusing and routing for the underdog becomes second nature. Just when things start to get a little too sad, Cannie is there with a wise crack to set us back on track.<br />Weiner has a winner here and she is an author worth following. The writing is as intelligent and witty as our protagonist. Her characters become as real as family as the book progresses. This book is more than the title leads us to believe.

It is one of those days where you feel full of energy and everything seems to flow right and the challenges, that do come up are easily dealt with because you are feeling in top physical form. This diet is a tool to reach that success on a daily basis.<br /> The Zone introduces us to a diet that is healthy and balanced and certainly no fad. The premise is found in the fact that the body needs a healthy balance of carbohydrates, low fat protein, and monosaturated fat at each meal, and this book puts it in its simplest form to get you started. The author sets it forth in an easy how to manner with grocery lists so you can fill your cupboard with the staples that will be a part of your everyday.<br />Simply put the biochemistry is based on the fact that the intake and over-consumption of simple carbohydrates lead to surges of insulin in the blood and this in turn makes us sluggish. Over a lifetime it leaves us at risk for conditions such as heart disease and cancer. Low fat protein releases glucagon, which helps to mobilize fat as opposed to insulin, which works to store our excess calories. The result is an increase in weight if the balance is off.<br />Sears has written six other Zone books that explain things at length, but for the person who wants to jump in quick this was the book I found to be the most helpful. After a week in the Zone I am amazed at how sharp my thinking is and how much energy I have.

They come up in the ranks of the prison system like other children are oriented to boarding school and college.<br />Monster Kody has arrived and he is true to his Set and a leader among men.

Dr. Tom Dooley is famous for his selfless work among the people of Laos in the 1950's.  Here lay a need for health care in a land with only one western trained doctor, flanked by a multitude of witch doctors, with practices dating back to the Middle Ages. Dooley financed and ran a hospital that lay 5 miles from the border of communist Red China. His tiny 35 bed hospital was just the beginning of a new system that left the people healthier, and trained many of them to continue the work he started long after he was gone.<br />The book is filled with stories both cheerful and gruesome of his exploits among these uncomplaining people who learned to live with suffering so appalling I cringe to even think back upon it. Such basics as antibiotics, clean water, and a diet rich in the necessary nutrients for a baby to develop with a healthy prospect of seeing the future were lacking. A high mortality rate was more the rule than the exception.<br />These openhanded and accommodating individuals received Dr. Dooley and his team with a mixture of respect and suspicion. It was his deference and ability to impart the sentiment that Americans were there to help them for the sheer sake of the peoples needs, not for any political agenda, and not to conquer them as part of a realm like so many acquisitions.<br />The final product was more than one could hope for. The many different companies as well as private citizens that helped to make this endeavor work by volunteering their time and donations are also mentioned in the book with a pride and thankfulness I'm sure that Dooley hoped the world would recognize. This is one of the best books I have ever read.  Kelsana  6/5/01	2001-06-06

This story is an ingenious trip through the lives, both past and present, of two brothers and a woman who is questionable in demeanor and deed. As the novel opens, the author allows us a glimpse at an appalling act of violence that the rest of his story is literally wrapped around. So cleverly written he drops bits and pieces along the way like so many petals from a flower. I will not give one inkling of the story away because it is to be prized as a whole, but I will say the ending was a total surprise.<br />While I love the intricacies of Cooks writing, his florid prose distinguishes him as more than your ordinary mystery writer. Not simply a who-dun-it, this book allows you to see evil from a completely different perspective. Cook is the author of 15 novels and can certainly count me among his many fans.

McBride unravels a life forgotten and buried by a mother, who was born in 1921 to a Jewish Rabbi and his wife in Poland, and found Christianity and love in the arms of a black husband and her 12 children. The book tells two stories. The author tells of growing up in the projects of New York with a white mother and she tells her story of a young Jewish girl growing up in the south and then Harlem, always an outsider wanting only what all girls want, the love of her family and to be accepted.<br />It was early on in life that Ruth Shilsky realized that this would never happen. She found herself up against some of the greatest odds a person could face in an era of blatant racial prejudice and a family that turned their back on her because she dared to be different. The life she made was a remarkable one and the children she produced are all extraordinary people, to put it in the words of the author.  An inspiring read of warm languid prose, I couldn't put it down, nor could I stop rooting for \\"Mommy\\" who just never stopped moving forward.  Kelsana 6/3/01	2001-06-04

A remarkable memoir written by the daughter of a Moroccan general who was foiled in an attempted takeover of King Hassan II. In retaliation the King imprisoned General Oufkir&#8217;s wife and their 6 children for 20 years.<br />Malika tells her story with all the intensity of a doomed soul that has been blessed by a second chance. Her life in prison had become a black hole of suffering and torment, neglected and half starved, she lived with the threat of rats, scorpions, diptheria, typhoid and succumbed to a case of peritonitis that left her in a coma fighting for her very life without medical intervention. She started to believe she and her family were indeed protected by a mysterious presence.<br />In their fourteenth year of imprisonment an escape plan is formulated that leads the reader to share in the intense joy and trepidation that the author must have felt, a light loomed at the end of the black tunnel that had become her life.<br />This is the first non-fiction Oprah selection, and one of her best choices ever. It makes a statement about human rights that will never be forgotten by the reader. Hopefully it will reach out to the four corners of the globe and make a difference in the lives of others. I am awed and amazed by the coping strategies and psychological triumph of the human spirit over what appears to be such a hopeless situation.

The words simply flow as you read this book of short stories. I don't usually read short stories because it doesn't seem like there is enough time in 20 or so pages to become attached to a character but this author is the exception. Her stories are like short journeys that delve into the emotion of her characters leaving you closer to them than some authors can accomplish in an entire book. Each story is about a choice made, not always the best one for the moment but an adventure in living none-the-less.<br />In the first story she writes of a Grandmother who has emigrated from Calcutta to live in Sunnyvale, California with her son, his wife, and their two children. We are faced with her loneliness and yearning for a culture that is lost to her in this new country. I also moved to Sunnyvale from my home in New England and remember the feeling of displacement and longing I felt. I was an outsider who dressed differently and spoke with an accent; people were not always kind or receptive. I can only imagine how life changing it must be to come from another country; it is this emotion that the author expresses so clearly in not just the first story but throughout the book.<br />Divakaruni has enlightened us with her book of tales. She has made me feel at home in her characters heart. After reading her last book SISTER OF MY HEART, I realized that this author would always be my favorite, she is a master of her craft, and her new book has certainly not disappointed me.

The conversations are simple and straightforward with no banter or clever repartee. I would give this one a 3.5 if that option were available. It's amusing enough if you are in the mood for a light read. Kelsana  5/17/01	2001-05-17

This book is an unusual mix of modern day London, celebrity parties and the pampered rich, then in a breath the author takes us to a refugee camp in Nambula, Africa. The refugees are dying from starvation and cholera as they await a plague as old as the bible. The locusts are fast becoming a major problem and the only crops this nation has been able to grow after years of drought and famine are about to be sheared off at the roots by a cloud of hungry insects.<br />Our heroine, Rosie has left her cushy life and celebrity friends behind after a disastrous relationship. She has taken a position in an African refugee camp working as part of an organization that gives relief to starving families. When faced with a famine of undetermined proportion, a shipment of food and medicine that hasn't arrived, and no clue when the next shipment will arrive, she makes up her mind to call on her celebrity friends to do a performance to help raise the money.  The problems that ensue range from tragic to laughable as we watch London's pampered princesses of the stage and screen, toting perfume and packing blow dryers in a place where the people are so malnourished that their hairs falls out in tuffs.<br />This book is a brilliant look at two sides of the coin and Fielding does it so well. She certainly has more to offer than Bridget Jones, as endearing as Bridget is, this book shows us that the breadth and depth of her characters go beyond what she has become so famous for. This was an enjoyable book with a heart of it's own. A wonderful dose of reality.  Kelsana  5/15/01	2001-05-16

This is my first book by this author after seeing her speak at a bookshop near home where at least 100 people turned out to listen to her discuss her new book FOLLY. She was interesting and witty and I love a good mystery so I jumped right in. The story leads you into a cult that is rooted by the belief of change and transformation by work and heat. The work that it's followers are led to do is based on the properties of alchemy which is the medieval science pertaining to the transformation of a substance such as lead into silver and gold. The subject on it's own merit caught my attention and seemed quite interesting but I have to say the book dragged on.<br />Anne Waverly goes in as an undercover FBI agent to get to the bottom of things and is immediately paired up with two children that steal her heart away. It becomes her personal mission to save them from this nightmare that has become their life. For a mystery I found this book quite easy to put down, lacking the page turning effect these books usually have on me. I hoped for more as I read deeper into the book but bombastic as the ending was, it wasn't enough to save the book as a whole. I will try another of King's books because she is so highly praised but I would give this book no more than 3.5 stars.  Kelsana  5/11/01	2001-05-11

Jordan McAfee has returned to us from THE PACT to direct the legal drama that ensues after a group of teenage girls accuse Jack St. Bride of a crime that is so damming to him, that at times I had to put the novel down because the injustice was not to be tolerated.<br />Salem Falls is a sleepy little town in New Hampshire that is about to be awakened by a group of teen-age girls who have formed a wiccan coven of witches and decided to prey on the innocent, or not so innocent. That is the question and you will be left wondering till the end.<br />There is a line up of vivid and amusing characters to support the accused, all with stories of their own neatly entwined within the main plot. This is what I enjoy the most about this author's books. Not so much that she does it, but how she does it, making her books a mad, page turning frenzy till the end, at which point I sit back with a smile, knowing I have read another great book.

After finding myself immersed in the first 5 books of the Mitford series this book filled in a part of the story that I truly feel I missed out on. Written as an episodic adventure, we find out the circumstances behind the proposal and marriage of Father Tim to Cynthia.  Karon, with her loving touch has also given us a glimpse of characters that we have long since grieved for in the earlier novels. It was a joy to have them back in the world of Mitford even if only for this book.<br />Though shorter than the original books, it is written with the same warmth and grace that we have come to know from this author. From the moment I started chapter one I had a huge grin on my face with every page I turned. I do wish we had been privy to the reception since I am greedy for any time spent in Mitford.

It is when Olivia Jones is hired to write a book of Natalie's memoirs that we find out just how much she has given up for the vineyard and the family who has come to take it for granted.  Natalie's Husband has been dead for 6 months and her family is scandalized when she announces her engagement to Carl, the manager of the vineyard. Eyebrows are raised and accusations of improprieties are insinuated, all to Natalie's chagrin.<br />This is a story of a family that finds itself after a long and arduous journey. It is an informative look at the cultivation of grapes and what it takes to nurture them to their full potential through some of the worst weather one might imagine. There is so much more to this enjoyable story with surprises that I didn't see coming at the end.

Along the way she meets one oddity after another in wanna-be partners.<br />Tiffany, being true to her British façade of stoicism in any given situation, no matter how torturous, initially responds with what she is really thinking (usually quite witty and on the mark, just what we would want to say), followed by Tiffany telling us that she didn't actually say that. Her response of course was always one that falls at the top of the list of proprieties expectations. This technique is used frequently by the author and really gives the reader a release from the many unbearable situations that Tiffany calls dates.<br />Along with our heroine's trials and tribulations on the dating scene, we are introduced to her set of quirky friends that just add to the humor along the way.

The premise is based on an honest request made at a peace conference by a Cheyenne Indian Chief in the year 1854 to trade white women for horses. The women would become brides and the children of these unions would make assimilation into the white mans society easier for the Indians who astutely saw the future at hand, and were looking for a peaceful solution. The author assures us that in real life this never took place, but in this book it does, and the story that follows is nothing but magnificent.<br />May Dodd has been locked away in an insane asylum for her so called indecent behavior, a bright and cultured woman who has taken up with a common factory worker her parents will not accept, followed by two children born out of wed lock. It is May, who through an act of desperation, manipulates her way into the \\"Brides for Horses\\" campaign. The journals that she keeps throughout her adventure are the making of this story. Articulate and interesting in her views of life on the plains among the so-called savages, she starts to realize just how warm and accepting a people they are.

Strongly developed characters give the book a sense of companionship that is distinctive. Icy is brought up in a loving home by her grandparents. Emily a sensitive and kind woman, is the town misfit who has taken Icy on as her personal project.

The year is 1664 and 16 year-old Griet is sent to work as a maid in the Vermeer household where she is scorned by some and tolerated by others. A wonderful portrayal of life in the times of the famous Dutch artist as witnessed from the eyes of a young girl mesmerized by a greatness beyond her reach.<br />Though the author does not paint Vermeer in a very favorable light, he clearly portrays the egocentric expectations of a great master who is solely wrapped up in his work. The characters are interesting and the story flows well to an ending that is to be expected. It is the glimpse at human nature and the creative process of this great artist that is so enjoyable. That and a young girls love and respect for her master. A wonderful book.  Kelsana  4/04/01	2001-04-04

Another question comes to mind, how long is long?  This novel was very long and at points quite tedious. I stuck with it for two-thirds of the way and then had to come up for air. Perhaps I'm not the best person to review it, but to those who follow my reviews I feel compelled to let you know what I think.<br />The story is one of interest but I found that the author took too long to tell it. I personally come from the area of Massachusetts that is mentioned in the book and I have to admit I enjoyed much of the imformation imparted. I grew up near a historical whaling town and was amazed at what I learned from this book but it wasn't enough to keep me hanging on. Perhaps I'll try her next book. Kelsana  4/04/01	2001-04-04

Eight year-old Kellyanne Williamson has always had imaginary friends and most of the townsfolk of Lightening Ridge have catered to her illusion. Up until this time her brother Ashmol has teased her, and called her a fruit loop; but that is all about to change when Kellyanne's father, an opal miner in New South Wales, takes Pobby and Dingan on an outing to the mine. After forgetting Pobby and Dingan at the mine little Kellyanne is traumatized at the loss of her imaginary friends. What follows is a tale so imaginative I started to wonder if Pobby and Dingan really did exist. I suppose it is all a matter of perspective. This is an interesting story and a quick read. It leaves me wondering about the mind of an author that would write such a tale. This book was a page-turner and different than anything I have ever read.  Kelsana  4/04/01	2001-04-04

Her characters are well developed and likable, mostly they are flawed, with an inane sense of justice. This particular book introduces us to 23 year-old Prue who meets up with a young girl named Charlotte when they both board a train in London bound for Cornwall. Prue will be staying with her aunt Phoebe, while Charlotte will be staying with her far from doting Grandmother who just happens to live next door.<br />Pilcher writes beautifully of the surrounding countryside, which is always a delight when reading her books. In Cornwall, Prue will find fulfillment, and a little girl will find a home. As predictable as Pilcher may be it's how she presents her story that leaves one wanting more. The ending leaves the reader contented with a sense of deliverance for all involved; but why don't I leave that to this superb teller of tales.  Kelsana  4/01/01	2001-04-02

Trisha is out for a hike in the vast woods of Maine with her mom and brother when she finds herself lost and alone. What follows is a trek that covers more miles than this nine year old should have to face alone, with only a pittance of food and a walkman on which she is lulled to normality by listening to the exploits of her favorite baseball team and pitcher, Tom Gordon. What starts out as a little girl trying to cope with a difficult situation ends up being a horrifying expedition leading to hallucinations. Along the way she finds the bloody remains of mauled animal carcasses, and there is this ever-present feeling that she is being stalked.<br />I admit it was a page-turner, I wanted to know what would happen next, but it was mild compared to some of King's books. I enjoyed how the author developed the main character's change in mentation; we slowly watch her get weaker. The more time that passed the more Trisha's thought process and fears became warped and out of proportion.  This book is a short quick read you can probably finish in a day.  ....	2001-04-01

Written from a dog's point of view, \\"BOY\\" tells us of his trials and tribulations as he reminisces about his life. Born to a litter of 13 pups, feeding was not always easy; sometimes the closest he got to mother's milk was sucking on his brother's ear. The management team, as he so fondly calls his owners, changes after BOY fails at hunting, not realizing he is supposed to point at the bunny in the bush not pounce on it to play. We are privy to his courting of a female half his height, which was doomed from the start, along with his love of chickens and the utilities man, the fun never ends.<br />The scenarios are endless and each one more entertaining than the last.

Joyce is hypnotized by the beauty and attention of an exotic Greek sailor as she helps him in a Miami supermarket. Though the two can barely communicate verbally she falls deeply in love and at the age of 18 marries him against her parent's wishes.<br />Our story really begins when Nikos takes her home to his family on the Greek island of Ifestia where she realizes the ways and customs are quite different from the freedom she has taken for granted in the USA. Finding herself ruled over by a dominating Mother-in-law she does her best to fit in. The language barrier slowly becomes less of a problem as she grows to love the island but there is much more to living the ways of the past than she will ever be able to assimilate.<br />This was a wonderful book filled with more than a love story gone awry. It is the telling of a past political uproar and the wars and strife suffered by the people of Greece at the hands of the Nazi's, Turks and sometimes their own countryman. It is a story of personal freedom. I would give this book 4.5 stars if I had the option and I look forward to reading more titles by this author.  Kelsana  3/30/01	2001-03-30

Her curiosity takes her to a site of large ancient stones, it is here that she will find much more than the momentary bit of history she is expecting. As she steps through two of the stones she finds herself in a time portal that sends her back to the year 1743.<br />The story that follows is a tremendous work of historical fiction taking us back to the days of Bonnie Prince Charlie and the discourse that plagued the Scottish people. It is during the revolt against the British that Claire meets Jamie Frasier a character that is bigger than life and a man who will fill her life with love as well as angst. This book is a beautiful adventure filled with political intrigue, witchcraft, and an interesting look at the medical practices of the day which Claire is quick to pick up and expand upon, gaining respect as a healer.<br />This is the first book in a series of 5 books, the 5th to be released sometime this year.

Did I miss the point or did anyone notice that the major thread running throughout this book is child abuse. Suffice it to say that it wasn't intentional but when Scully's daughter shows up alone at Shannon airport traumatized and speechless, unable to explain the whereabouts of her mother, he begins the trek of a lifetime to find her. The book goes on and on as he drags Billie from country to country and bar to bar unable to face the truth, that his wife has left him.<br />Seven-year-old Billie, is mauled by a dog, her face becomes infected and scared due to improper care. Scully brings her to squalid bars while he gets drunk day after day where she listens to disgusting language. In Amsterdam she is left to her own demise, as her father gets drunk to drown his sorrow. Somewhere around this point Scully is hit over the head and carted off to jail on Christmas Day.<br />I stuck with this book because the author actually made Scully out to be a devoted dad and a likable character, the beginning of the book was exceptional and I was curious about the ending. It's just too bad he didn't follow through. I do wish there was more tie in to \\"The Riders\\", a ghostly group, mysteriously introduced in the beginning but that was also anticlimactic, and given no more than a few pages.<br />The time came when I felt like enough is enough it's time to take it like a man Scully, and take care of your child. I got to the point where I didn't even care what happened to his wife Jennifer. I find it hard to believe this book was up for the Booker prize. I found it easy to skip whole paragraphs in the middle as Scully's paranoia ran rampart and repetitive. I kept thinking am I missing the point here but every time I doubted my reading savvy I was put off by the underlying child abuse.  Kelsana  3/19/01	2001-03-20

I must say right off that this is a historical memoir and though the book is written to include the thoughts and letters of Galileo's daughter, Suor Maria Celeste who chose her name in honor of her fathers celestial interests, it is very much a piece of historical fact. The author has brilliantly researched and added translations and photos of hundreds of documents and items pertaining to the period, including many of the letters written to Galileo by his cloistered daughter. These private thoughts, feelings and fears have been cleverly molded into a story that sheds light on the life of this brilliant man and his futuristic views.<br />A Man before his time, Galileo's belief that the Earth revolved around the sun brought great discord to the Catholic Church's hierarchy. An outstanding mathematician and scientist he was also remembered to be a profound philosopher. I am giving this book 5 stars because it is beautifully constructed and adds substance and passion to a historical figure that was merely another name in a history book.

Anju and Sudha are cousins growing up in a house full of women in the city of Calcutta, India. Their personalities, like night and day, bring us a blend of rich and exotic culture wrapped up in the ideas that society imposes upon them. The author entwines this richness with the silent sorrows and heavy heart of the unknown. A secret so dreadful that one of the girls can never shed light upon it without fear of losing everything that she holds dear.<br />There were several unexpected surprises in this book. The author is a fantastic storyteller and I found such astonishing insight into the human heart I was moved to reread the book just to spend time writing down quotes which I found to be words one could live by.

McBride unravels a life forgotten and buried by a mother who was born in 1921 to a Jewish Rabbi and his wife in Poland, and found Christianity and love in the arms of a black husband and her 12 children. The book tells two stories. The author tells of growing up in the projects of New York with a white mother and she tells her story of a young Jewish girl growing up in the south and then Harlem, always an outsider wanting only what all girls want, the love of her family and to be accepted.<br />It was early on in life that Ruth Shilsky realized that this would never happen. She found herself up against some of the greatest odds a person could face in an era of blatant racial prejudice and a family that turned their back on her because she dared to be different. The life she made was a remarkable one and the children she produced are all extraordinary people, to put it in the words of the author.

This is the story of two children whose life is changed in the flash of an angry moment. What follows is a story of undaunted spirit as Lou and Oz are sent off to live with their great-great grandmother, Louisa Mae Cardinal, in the mountains of rural, Virginia. The lessons of hard work and simplicity bring to light the strength and determination of those that make their home in the shadow of the Appalachian Mountains .<br />It is with Louisa Mae, that a true respect for the land is instilled within the children while learning the importance of a supportive mountain community during rough times. They find that true treasure lies within themselves, not in the material goods that the outside world puts so much importance upon.  When Natural gas is found on Louisa Mae's farm that love of the land is heartily put to the test.  The book wraps up with a courtroom scene in some ways reminiscent of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\".<br />This book is not only touching but uplifting. There are several revelations that are quite unexpected, along with a cast of characters alive and vivid with the history of the era. Lou has a wonderful way of saying just what we all would like to say leaving the reader with the satisfaction that a strong purposeful character brings to a book.

I am amazed at the way the author left me thinking about the balance of nature and how any given action has a world of consequences in the grand scheme of things.

From the moment I started this novel, along with every cup of tea that was served, I felt like I was headed home. Pilcher has an innate ability to put you into the world she has created; in this case the Scottish countryside, with the sheer power of her words. It is a pleasure to step away and fully engulf myself in the smooth cadence of her characters and their lives.<br />The five main characters are all at a crossroads in their lives, and it is at an Estate House in Northern Scotland that the world meets them all head on. Elfrida, a retired actress who is full of life, with a heart as big as the United Kingdom, and Oscar her companion, set out for the house after an unexpected tragedy that leaves Oscar in the doldrums of life.<br />Carrie and her young niece Lucy set out to spend Christmas at the Estate House after Lucy's mother and grandmother make it clear that she is nothing but a nuisance impinging on their time and lifestyle. Then there is Sam, an unforeseen surprise who shows up during a snowstorm with a key and a story that will change the world for each of them in one way or another.<br />Winter Solstice is intricate and lasting. I didn't know that a book could leave you feeling this good. I especially enjoyed her portrayal of older characters. I found it refreshing to read how young at heart a person can be no matter what their age might be. I've read and enjoyed most of Pilcher's books and I must say that Winter Solstice is the diamond in her crown.	2001-01-26

Twelve-year-old David Hayden is about to watch three generations of his family enter into a maelstrom of events that will rip a family apart, leaving a gapping wound that time will never repair. This is the story of two brothers, one the favored son of a rich landowner, a doctor, and war hero, while the other is a father's disappointment.<br />Marie Little Soldier reveals a dark secret that sets Sheriff Hayden off on an investigation that turns up much more than is expected. Add murder to the formula, and you have a page turning thriller that will leave you aghast at the direction it takes.<br />Watson's writing flows along effortlessly as you catapult to an ending of cataclysmic proportion for this family. A family that has not only thrived on the justice of their time, but also has held it like a scepter to which there were no reprisals.<br />This author writes with a western flare of youth lost to an irrepressible end, quite similar to \\"All the Pretty Horses\\". I am looking forward to \\"Justice\\" which is a prequel to \\"Montana 1948\\". It gives an added glimpse into the lives of the characters before the winds of change turn their world on end. Watson is a keen storyteller that is certainly worth reading. 12/28/00	2000-12-28

To anyone who has spent time on the net chatting or in a virtual reality called a MUD (multiple user domain), this book will tickle your fancy. I have to give the author credit for a unique book and story line.<br />StElene's is the virtual world run by Suntum International. It is here that Reed takes us into the psyche of an array of characters that are diversified and interesting. We watch them manage their RL (real life), along with their VL (virtual life). Jenny AKA Zan to her friends on StElene's has become addicted to her on line lover, Reverdy. Stretched thin by night after night spent on the computer till dawn, she starts to confuse her worlds. This confusion, and what she finds herself driven to do is the substance that keeps you turning the pages.<br />I did enjoy this book enough to give it 3 stars, but I found the dialogue repetitive and sometimes found myself skimming over whole paragraphs. Worth the read if you have extra time. 12/23/00	2000-12-24

I will not spoil the ending for you, but theirs is a fated love that ends triumphantly, it's effects reaching out to touch the people of this small North Carolina town.<br />This book warmed my heart.

I'm from a small New England town just south of Gloucester and this book brought me back to the days when my husband and many of my friends were fishermen. Working on a Swordfish boat was the best money to be had, but the life was demanding when faced by the elements and fourteen to sixteen hour days, it could be feast or famine. Jungar has written an intelligent and scientifically based book that gives us a glimpse at the final days of a crew of men who are swallowed up by nature herself.<br />The competition is stiff, and the demand to produce results is placed on the head of the Captain of the Andrea Gail, which leads him to go out on a fishing trip late in the season.  When the catch is not up to standards they move on to an area that is beyond the bounds of comfort, in hopes of fulfilling these expectations.<br />What follows is a storm of nuclear proportion leaving them with little chance of survival. The author's explanation of the end, for this fated crew and ship, was extremely moving as well as technical. He clearly filled me with the terror they must have felt as they realized there was no going back and death was imminent. A memorable book that left me yearning for a clear day, a warm breeze, and calm seas. 12/23/00	2000-12-24

That's how life starts to feel for Cheryl, but somehow she just can't stop the forward progression that may lead to the demise of all she holds dear. &quot;A Family Affair&quot; is a smoothly written, quick read, that I would give 3 1/2 stars.<br />  The story starts out with David coming home from Viet Nam after escaping from a North Vietnamese prison camp; psychologically he is faced with nightmares and an unending guilt. To add to his dilemma his dad Harold, has married a woman Cheryl, 19 years his junior and only a few years older than David. Tension abounds in the day-to-day living that is their present situation. It is compounded by the fact that David has arrived on their doorstep with a bubble gum chewing, spiked heels toting wife, Angela.<br />The story goes on from there to work itself out in 177 pages, and is an enjoyable read for a rainy day sitting in front of the fireplace. It is a love story that has a taste of disloyalty and redemption, second thoughts, and the premise that, \\"People are weak and ineffectual when threatened by passion\\".<br />The author wraps it up with a telling epilogue that enlightens us as to where the characters are thirty years later. There is a predictable surprise, but an enjoyable one nonetheless.  12/15/00	2000-12-15

First I want you to know that there are no spoilers here. The book starts with the act of suffocation and then goes on to explain the circumstances. Jamie MacDonald loves his wife Maggie with a fierce loyalty. When Maggie's cancer ridden body becomes more than she can bear she asks him to kill her. What follows is a journey that there is no coming back from.<br />  Cam MacDonald is the highly respected police chief in a small town and is married to Allie who adores him to the point that she has lost herself in this man she calls her husband. The sun rises in the east due to the light she sees in Cam's eyes. Allie's world is about to come crashing down around her. Hers is also a journey that will take her to a place that there is no coming back from.<br />Cam is not only the police chief, but by no choice of his own, he has become the respected head of the MacDonald Clan, whose ancestors hail from Scotland. They have settled in Wheelock, Massachusetts over the centuries.  Jamie comes to Wheeloch to enjoy his last hours with Maggie and commit his act of love.<br />The author has created a multifaceted situation and has gone on to superbly blend the stories together. We are dealt a betrayal on two fronts and we watch as the characters wade through the mire that their lives become because of it. This is another great book by Picoult. She was kind enough to chat with my book group on line a few months back and told us this was her personal favorite. I have to admit I'm hooked, and I have now bought every one of her books. I am anxiously awaiting her new book SALEM FALLS that should be out in the first part of the New Year. 12/14/00	2000-12-14

Comrade Manna Wu has spent most of her adult life waiting for the love of a good man that she can call her own. This story gives us a glimpse at the personal lives of couples in Communist China 30 years ago.<br />  Manna sets her cap for a doctor in the military hospital where she is a nurse. The doctor, Lin Kong, is torn between the desire for Manna, an intelligent modern Chinese woman that is so far untouched, (nurses must be virgins when they enter the program), and the comfort of his familiar life in the country with a dutiful wife whose bound feet and submissive ways are from an era gone by.<br />Lin's marriage has produced one daughter and the separation between Lin and his wife has gone on for 17 years. So far for various reasons he has been unable to obtain a divorce. In the 18th year of separation he is finally given his freedom to marry Manna Wu. At this point the story takes some unexpected turns that I will save for the reader to discover.<br />Lin is a man who would rather take the easy way out, yet he's concerned with how people view his actions. The 18 years of waiting becomes a comfortable way of life for him, so comfortable that when he is finally freed from the obligations to his wife he realizes that the arrival of his dream might eventually lead to his undoing. A comrade opens Lin's eyes by pointing out that his problem arises from his own character, \\"If you have the will to change you can create the condition for change\\".<br />I enjoyed this book on several different levels, it was a twisted love story that kept me reading and rooting for the underdog, and it gave me an appreciation for a culture and way of life completely foreign to me. I certainly couldn't have showed the patience instilled in the females of this culture but that made it all the more interesting to me. 12/12/00	2000-12-13

Not long after, miracles start to occur around Faith, and this small town in New Hampshire starts to realize that Faith is not only speaking to &quot;God&quot;, but that her God is a woman.<br />The faithful start to arrive on Faiths' doorstep in search of miracles; along with the media led by a card carrying atheist whose TV show thrives on disproving such hype.  They are all found camping out, waiting to have a moment, or a word with Faith. In the mean time the custody battle between Faiths' parents flares up leaving her torn between them as well as more confused with each passing day. The complications heighten when this innocent child exhibits the bleeding hands of the stigmata, leaving the doctors completely baffled.<br />Jodi Picoult is an author that will keep you coming back for more and will easily make a fan out of you.  She takes a story and makes you question it every turn of the page. Something that may appear to be blatantly true is transformed into the totally unexpected, you will find yourself doubting just about everyone in the book at one point or another.<br />I suggest another of this authors books if you haven't had enough, &quot;THE PACT, A LOVE STORY&quot; which is about a teen suicide, another great read. The end of every chapter leaves you wondering about the veracity of each characters statement. Sometimes she does it with just one word, turning your idea of things &quot;head over heels&quot; when you thought you had it all figured out. Picoult is a truly talented author and worth watching and reading, you will certainly be entertained.	2000-12-11

I have never read a book that was so exquisitely tuned into the mind and feelings of the human condition. The lead character is turning 50 years old and decides to take a road trip. Oh, she's not headed anywhere special on the map, but this trip couldn't be more important.<br />As Nan meanders across the country on those back roads that only the towns people use, she is content to pull up and set for a spell on the porch of a woman that seems to know exactly why she came, though the two have never met. She sits down to meals in diners with complete strangers and finds she has more in common with them than she might expect.<br />Along the way she writes letters to her husband, honestly pouring her heart out to him, letting him know how their comfortable day to day saunter through life may not always have been all that was expected. The trip is a revelation for both of them in the end.<br />This is a coming of age book, it points out the wisdom that gradually permeates the mind and spirit as we ripen with time.  I can't begin to tell you how revealing Berg's insights are, I got the feeling that she went through life taking notes on all of those little things that we experience and never give a thought to, little, insidious things that can impact our outlook on life in the most profoundest of manners. Read this book and I promise you won't be disappointed, you will find yourself in the midst of more than your share of \\"a-hah\\" moments and this book will make you realize just what a comforting thing that can be.  12/10/00	2000-12-11

Loved it, loved it, and so will you if you enjoy characters that are far from perfect with hearts as big as a Wal-Mart sign. The Honk and Holler reminds me of life in a small town where everyone meets at the local diner on a daily basis. Yes, all you city folks, places like this really exist where the lives of its inhabitants are entwined in a two-step of ups and downs.<br />Caney, a Viet Nam vet who lives his life in a wheel chair and runs the Honk and Holler just seems to pick up strays and not just the four-legged variety. Starting with the moment Vena Takes Horse shows up with a three-legged dog, his life is sent spinning into a direction that will never be the same again.<br />He is flanked and hovered over by Molly O who has decided to make Christmas &quot;Merry&quot; one way or the other, trimming the napkin holders with fuzzy haired Barbie dolls doing the splits. There are so many rich and interesting characters in this book that I miss them even now. How wonderful to find a group of people flawed yet caring enough to accept each other for the people they are.<br />Billie Letts brings it all together nicely at the end with a wrap up that will warm your heart. I have to be truthful, I figured out the ending, but it was the road I traveled to get to it that I enjoyed so much. Certainly worth a read, you won't be disappointed.	2000-12-02

The best advice I can give you is, \\"Get this book and read it now\\". Click on the link above and order it from Amazon, or go to the nearest bookstore and buy it, or get your self to the library and hand over that library card, because you are in for a treat.<br />First of all read this book knowing it is a novel and the author had to add a lot to the minimal information that was available about Joan. Donna Cross has put together an entertaining historical piece of fiction about the Dark Ages where a woman changes her identity to become John Anglicus and finally Pope John VIII. Along the way there is romance, intrigue, battles and rescues. There is something for everyone with an ending that left me with my mouth hanging open....well for a little while at least.<br />The author explains how she wrote the book at the end, and tells us about the history that she was able to find during her research. Through out the book you are wondering, did she exist? Personally, when I read that Pope John XX had changed his title to Pope John XXI after he had the matter researched I was sold on her existence.<br />Not one of my friends that have read this book have had a negative thing to say about it....read it for the novel and story it is and you will have a wonderful adventure not soon forgotten....Kelsana	2000-12-01

I first read Bambi 30 years ago and was lucky enough to find a 1929 copy that I will hold dear to my heart forever. The author takes you deep into the forest where you become one of the animals. You can feel the cold and smell the fear among them when the two-legged animal called &quot;Man&quot; arrives. It allows readers to immerse themselves in the world, seeing it from an animal's point of view.<br />It's a great book to share with kids and a valuable learning experience about the ways of nature. At times it is cruel and very true to life. It teaches respect for our elders, and love of family. We stand back and watch Bambi grow stronger until he has a sense of wisdom that only experience can bring. This is truly a book to share with your kids. It is so much more than a Disney cartoon.	2000-11-28

The detonation of these nuclear weapons leaves the country in an age where Scavengers are set against those people trying to pull their family and world back to something that hardly resembles the past greatness of America.  In this book the Russians are the culprits and they give several other countries the backing to help with the initial destruction. The countries of the world have ganged up on the USA for being greedy and using up most of the world's resources.<br />It is many years later and history is at times comically rewritten by the elders who have lived through the nuclear attack. The aged Tom spends much of his time teaching the younger adults about the world as he remembers it from days gone by. Books are rare and trade is a major source for goods.<br />I found this book completely believable. The borders of the USA are being watched and the Japanese are patrolling the west coast from a base set up on Catalina. It has been decided by the United Nation that the borders will be secured and America will stand alone for 100 years, what an incredible concept this author has come up with.<br />The characters are well developed and I shed a tear or two. Science fiction is a new genre to me and this author has opened up realms of possibilities. This book is the first in the trilogy followed by \\"The Gold Coast\\" and \\"The Pacific Edge\\".  I will certainly enjoy more of this author's writings. Kelsana  11/21/00	2000-11-21

Merrick was a wonderful blend of the Mayfair Witches and The Vampire Chronicles.  The story told from David Talbot's perspective started slowly but took off in the fine tradition that we have always known Rice to be capable of.<br />David begins his tale by searching out Merrick to request her help in contacting the spirit of Claudia.  Louis suffers unending guilt for producing the fledgling Claudia, and needs reassurance that she has moved on to a happier existence.  This will set off a chain of events that will take you back in time and introduce you to some of Rice's most vivid characters.  Merrick uses a blend of Voodoo Magic and Catholicism to conjure up spirits that you will never forget.<br />Lestat plays a small but important role in this book and the ending leaves us with the promise of tales of his time spent out of body.  A gauntlet is thrown down by the Talamasca, leaving us wondering if it will step out of its age old position of observation only.  The events surrounding this are what will keep you turning the pages.  This book brings me back to the style of the original Vampire Chronicles, which I so needed from this author.	2000-11-21

Windchill Summer takes place in Arkansas during the Viet Nam era.  As Mailer spins her tail she allows the characters to voice their perspective by presenting each chapter in the words of someone different, allowing the story to slowly unfold.  One of the characters is found dead along the way and that adds a bit of mystery.  The author very cleverly goes back in time allowing even the dead to present their story.  Most important of all she does this with such skill that it is never confusing.  Mailer's transition between times and characters is smooth and effortless.  Her characters are steeped in their values and misconceptions about religion, the war and each other. Characters that are so real and complete that you feel like they are your personal friends.  By the end we know the whole story while some of the main characters will never know everything that we have seen through other peoples eyes.  Mailer has weaved an incredible tapestry about life in a small southern town that brings us back to Viet Nam for glimpses of the &quot;My Lai Massacre&quot; under the command of Lt. Cally, the Viet Cong, and the frailty of the killing machines that used to be the boys next door.  The portrayal of Mailer's characters is so well done that I hated to leave them behind on the pages of her book.....Kelsana	2000-11-01
