She believes that, with this publication, she's launching a renaissance, \\"an electrifying new solution for captivating a generation of readers reared on television, movies and music videos.\\" <br /> <br />The solution? Use color and layout. Color pages, color backgrounds, color texts, change the way words are presented on the page, and it is possible to undo the damage done to generations of readers. Ms. Kirschenbaum believes that visual engagement can create enough of a connection between readers and literature to turn around the National Endowment for the Arts' statement that \\"literary reading as a leisure activity will virtually disappear in half a century.\\" <br /> <br />Ms. Kirschenbaum presents a brilliant history of the printed word, visually rich and conceptually sound. Anecdotal evidence from her ten years of teaching in a blighted urban school provides a firm, but very narrow, foundation for her theses. Her historical research is sound and detailed; her examples are profuse and profound. Her conclusions, though, are heavily influenced by her love of physical books, her feminist principles, and her geopolitical environment. Her presentation, extremely self-promoting, at times breathless and, by her own admission, \\"purple,\\" shouldn't detract from a reader's enjoyment of the book or the lessons it has to offer. <br /> <br />The author's assertions that she is the first female to construct a tome like this, from font to content to design and layout, may or may not be literally true, but the feminist slant detracts from the importance of parts of the message - that people can learn better, be more engaged by, more entertained by, a profuse use of color and layout in literary works. <br /> <br />Is she right? Maybe for some people. Others of us relish the flow of monochrome words on a smooth, simple background, colored by our imaginations, pictured by our dreams, giving us a break from the hyperlinked, hyperstimulating, hyperactive world around us. <br /> <br />Whether you agree with all of Ms. Kirschenbaum's assertions or not, the fact remains that she has conceived and produced one of the most beautiful non-art books I've ever had the pleasure to hold in my hands. The memes she has set loose will, undoubtedly, influence the way I, and I hope others, look at texts for our children, literature for our own consumption, and production values for bound matter. For that - bravo!	2004-11-30

Jonathan Tropper's The Book of Joe is one of those books.<br />It's a safe bet that most of us use our past to fuel our present. Whether dreaming about the glory days or subconsciously trying to atone for things we've done wrong, we somehow define ourselves by who we were as much as who we are. Joe Goffman is a poster child for that definition.<br />Joe, who has written a wildly successful work of fiction that pretty well trashed everybody in his small home town, is coerced into returning when his father, his only surviving parent, has a stroke. From Joe's less-than-warm reception through the rest of this engaging story, the events of the past provide a context for the searching, self-immolation and eventual re-discovery that comes from seeing if it's really possible to go home again, or if home belongs in the past, and is best left there.<br />More than a little wry humor wraps Joe's recollections of hormone-filled high school days with the patina of cynicism that intervening years supply. That coating helps to keep the book from descending into the dark, regretful tone that could have marred its enjoyability. You'll laugh; you'll cry (I did).	2004-06-19

It's obviously an earlier Nick, and written by an obviously less-experienced Andy McNab, but it's chock-full of tradecraft and suspense.

US	52977088	RZSP6HL36ZQ6Y	0385511612	430694437	Bleachers	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Glory days?	After some bad impressions of John Grisham's earlier &quot;non-legal&quot; books, I was going to pass on Bleachers. My wife read it, and gave it a middling good review, so I decided to read it, as well. Its short length helped -- after all, you can put up with anything for just a little while...<br />As Neely showed up for the Coach's funeral watch, I was caught up in his bitterness, always just a little below the surface. I was carried along in the memories he tried to run from -- the glory days, the days of being a young hero in a town that worshipped their High School football team, the days of invincibility and local fame.<br />Even those of us who weren't athletes often look back on the &quot;golden days&quot; with nostalgia and, like Neely, some twinges of regret for things that still may be unresolved, and in their lack of resolution, affect the tenor of our lives. Those twinges, and what we do with them, is part of what defines the person we are now. Those twinges, and the way their resolution or lack of resolution flows through Bleachers, is why you should read the book.	2003-09-22

I don't usually read &quot;prequels,&quot; but the craftsmanship in the later book was good enough that I gave the earlier book a whirl. I was, in a word, impressed.<br />If you like suspense, especially with a backdrop of religion and conspiracy, this is a must-read. Illuminati infiltrating the Vatican? Vows of revenge resurrected after hundreds of years? You bet!<br />Robert Langdon's character is not quite as well developed as in The Da Vinci Code, but he's rounded enough to be believable.

I hadn't read any of Greg Rucka's earlier books, but when I stumbled across a review of A Fistful of Rain, I decided to give it a read. Now I know what I've been missing!<br />Rucka combines terse prose and sudden plot twists with an amazing ability to make you identify with the characters. But the real draw in Fistful is excitement -- I started reading it on my morning train-ride, and almost missed my stop. I considered spending the first few hours of the workday in a corner finishing it, but compromised by staying up late that night. Yes, it's that good.	2003-09-11

Le Guin's Changing Planes was somewhat of a homecoming for me, as I've read little speculative fiction lately.

The Teeth of the Tiger shows Clancy mellowing a little bit. The book's light physical weight in comparison to his previous tomes doesn't mean that the plot is lightweight at all; if anything, it's an indication that his writing style is getting much tighter. There's not as much of the gee-whiz military tech description that Clancy's become known for, and in this case, that absence supports the plot very well.<br />Sure, Jack Ryan plays a part in the book (Jack Junior, though, not the ex-President). So do a couple of Jack's nephews. John Clark's name is even mentioned, but that and a couple of references to events in Clancy's previous books is all that remains of the old.<br />Imagine an organization with total deniability, working outside the Constitution, indeed, entirely outside the Government, to make a dent in the US's shadowy enemies. Only the right people could keep an organization like this from becoming a monster in its own right. Will they? Only the sequels know for sure, and the ending makes it pretty plain that more will follow.<br />Bring 'em on!	2003-09-03

I had to wait almost a week between them, and it nearly drove me crazy! Pity the people who read this book as soon as it came out!<br />Alex Cross is back. I find his love life a little distracting, probably because it's so realistic -- a guy that's definitely married to his job -- but over the course of the Alex Cross books, his character has been fleshed out to the point where he's realer than a lot of th &quot;meat&quot; people I've met.<br />As yet another nemesis enters Cross's life, Patterson continues his strong tradition of steady character development coupled with rapid-fire action. The only shortcoming of this book, if it can be called a shortcoming, is that it's separated into this book and its sequel.	2002-02-27

When she told us that her students (she teaches at a local private school) call her \\"the sex lady,\\" I wasn't surprised. When she explained some of today's kids' (we're talking kids, not even teens) attitudes about sex, sexuality, and sexual activity, I was very surprised.<br />I've always considered myself enlightened and pretty progressive, but when it comes to what our kids are thinking and doing, I felt like a Puritan. According to Ms. Roffman, the roles that we as a society thrust on our kids put them under an incredible amount of pressure about themselves, their sexuality, and their values.<br />This book is written just the way Ms. Roffman speaks -- frankly, straightforwardly, and plainly, with no holds barred. If you're the parent of a pre-teen or teen, or know a pre-teen or teen, you should put this book near the top of your must-read list.	2002-02-27

If the dot-com boom hadn't turned into the dot-con bust, I'd probably be in a better neighborhood, but I'm really glad that I read this book before I went out looking for a 4,000 square foot mausoleum to live in.<br />The &quot;not so big&quot; house is a home that puts more emphasis on quality of surroundings and use of space that do current trendy home designs. While the book was written more as an architectural guide for envisioning and planning a home, there's a wealth of information in it that do-it-yourselfers like me can benefit from. Not only does Ms. Susanka explain what makes a not so big house feel bigger and better, she explains the artistic and architectural principles upon which her philosophy is based. With detailed case studies, photos, and illustrations, she gets her point across clearly, concisely, and quite pleasantly.<br />Whether you're preparing to build a new home, remodel an existing one, or just improve your quality of life in your current surroundings, this book has a wealth of helpful information.	2002-02-27

When I took the &quot;test&quot; accompanying the article, I noticed that most of the people I know would show as borderline autistic! I was freaked, until I found:<br />&quot;It seems that for success in science or art, a dash of autism is essential. For success, the necessary ingredient may be an ability to turn away from the everyday world, from the simply practical, an ability to re-think a subject with originality so as to create in new untrodden ways, with all abilities canalised into the one specialty.&quot; --Hans Asperger (1979)<br />Of course, I didn't find that quote until I got this book.<br />Tony Attwood does an outstanding job of gathering information about the range of symptoms and resulting handicaps associated with Asperger's Syndrome. What he doesn't do as well is to present effective interventions or treatments. I think the reasons for this include the relative newness of differentiating Asperger's from other mild autisms, but also the mistaken (IMHO) belief that psychology is a real science, as opposed to a way to isolate everyone with their own special labels.<br />Read this book if you have a real concern that a child you're responsible for may need professional evaluation. Don't however, fall into the trap that mild symptoms are in fact pointers to the disorder -- you'll suspect every kid under 20, and most adults.	2002-02-27

Welcome back to small-town Southern lawyering, combined with a mystery (a couple million my$tery, at that).<br />When Professor Ray Atlee, summoned by his father to discuss his will, finds him DOA, the first question I asked myself was, &quot;Why wasn't this a short story?&quot; When Ray found boxes of cash in the study, I changed my question to, &quot;Who, why, what the....?&quot; And then the fun started.<br />This book is worth a read. It's not as tense as The Firm, but it is as quirky, and the ending, although you sort of expect it, has a bit of the old &quot;Grisham twist&quot; to it. Don't read ahead; that's cheating.	2002-02-27

Sure, language has changed with the advent of the Web, but the egregious overuse of made-up jargon, describing concepts that are probably not close-in enough to spawn the casual, nickname-ish use prevalent in this book's narrative.<br />Gratuitous jargon, gratuitous sex, and labored narrative just don't cut it.

It doesn't matter whether the tool is a power saw, a bulldozer, or a computer. The Philosophical Programmer provides just that kind of background for computers. The book's cover calls it &quot;a programming book for English majors,&quot; but it's considerably more than that. Even if you have absolutely no desire to know the evolution of memory chips and programming languages, you should still read the rest of this book. If you're already neck-deep in geek, read it for the insights about the computer as a tool and an extension of a person.	2001-03-26

Even though Cornwell's bread and butter isn't present in fact in this book, the gutsy Chief and Assistant Chief of the Charlotte Police Department are cut from the same mold. If you like Kay, you'll like West and Hammer. Twisted serial killers, strange personal relationships, and typical Cornwell plot devices make this a good read, if a shallow one.<br />The cassette version (abridged) leaves a little of the continuity out, but even there the color comes through.	2001-01-16

It's a quick read, and well worth your time, but beware! If you think the world is completely rational, and you can explain *everything* in a finite set of narrative, your mind is subject to change.	2001-01-16
