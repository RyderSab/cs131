While the text is riddled with repetition, the action is slow-moving and contained within the last fifty pages, the work is a decent prelude to the final book. <br /> <br />It is darker and more adult than the last, but undoubtedly much better. Rowling has benefited from shortening her tale, although this book felt too much like a conclusion of Book 5 and the opening of Book 7 to be constructed as a work in itself. Similarly, the series undoubtedly draws on other texts like 'Lord of the Rings' etc, and this becomes increasingly evident within Book 6. <br /> <br />Furthermore, it holds an odd space as an adult text that has cornered a child/teenage market, and the writing is a weird mixture of complex ideas (i.e. spliting the soul) and childlike writing. I cannot possibly fathom why parents would consider reading this to their young children or why it is not considered an entirely adult work, when it so clearly is. <br /> <br />Thankfully, Rowling has not fallen into the trap of making her text predictable, although the ideas come far too late, as does the introduction of the Half-Blood Prince. Dumbledore's revelations should have started earlier to really make the work as gripping as Rowling's earlier pieces.	2005-07-17

This was a quick, engrossing, well-written but ultimately dissatisfying read. <br /> <br />Essentially, the dynamics of the relationship between Ann and Lucy make unbearable reading. Not only is Lucy self-absorbed and entirely dislikable, Ann is, in her own words, an 'ant' who continously and monotonously allows herself to be trampled on. Whether the portrayal of Lucy was skewed, it certainly was subtlely damning. <br /> <br />As much as I wanted to sympathise with Lucy (and as much as I did in the beginning), she is was overbearing and unbearable character, and her self-destruction was predictable and repetitive. <br /> <br />While I continue to like Patchett's writing, this book seemed self-indulgent and repetitive. Lucy and Ann's friendship was annoying and unbalanced, much like the text itself.	2005-07-10

I throughly enjoyed my first Elizabeth Berg work. Beautifully written, heartbreakingly sad, this work is a divine little text about the pains of widowhood and trying to establish a place for oneself outside a loving relationship. <br /> <br />The memories are beautifully realised and wonderfully realistic, and the pain is deeply felt while reading. The descriptions of the town, the shop and the friendships are lovely, as is this work on the whole. <br /> <br />Many past reviewers have suggested its an unrealistic portrayal of widowhood, however it is ridculous to assume that any person gets over the death of a spouse in the same way as another. There is thus no 'realistic' way, and this seems as valid as any other.   <br /> <br />Furthermore, others have suggested that it concludes too quickly. I thought it ended with hope and promise, and was wonderfully rounded without handfeeding the reader. <br /> <br />All in all, a likable and utterly readable little work and a great introduction to Berg's works.	2005-06-27

This is an exceptionally light ready, but much better than most other chick-lit texts, although remaining as predictable as most works within this genre. <br /> <br />The characters are well-developed and interesting, and with the exception of Hannah, likable. The writing is generally satisfying, although there are a number of cringe-worthy lines and incidents within the work, and the book needs a good editor to weed out numerous grammatical mistakes. <br /> <br />Other than that, this is an enjoyable work which will sate any desire for chick-lit.	2005-06-25

I really wanted to like this book, and I do like the concept. However, the execution comes off as weak, self-indulgent and entirely forgettable. There are countless problems with this work.    Firstly, the stucture of the text is overtly flawed. The links that are made between each topic within a chapter are barely discernible and completely forced. For example, the similarity between school teachers and sumo wrestlers is that they both cheat on occasions. Well, so do many people outside these professions. Furthermore, the conclusions that are gathered from such case studies seem incredibly obvious and painfully shallow.     I did not necessarily understand the reasoning behind putting little self-indulgent extracts from an New York Time article on Levitt as a prelude to each chapter, such as 'Lewitt fits everywhere and nowhere. He is a noetic butterfly that no one has pinned down..' Such extracts come across as laughable and entirely pointless within a work on the unconscious economics of everyday interactions.    Importantly, I also think the writer of this work plays to the very dichotomies he is supposedly trying to break down. For example, he comments on the higher schooling averages of urbanised students, by saying 'It may be that cities attract a more educated workforce and, therefore, parents with smarter children' (P166.) Is this not the very assumption he is trying to discard? He is essentially suggesting that some children are simply 'smarter' and that socioecomics and race are completely distinct from notions of 'smart-ness.'    Another example of this occurs when he discusses the naming of African American children, in particular a child named Temptress. He concludes that 'It isn't much of a stretch to assume that Temptress didn't have ideal parents. Not only was her mother willing to name her Temptress, but she wasn't smart enough to know what it meant' (P181.) Completely unnecessary and undermining the apparent purpose of the work, which is seeminglyagainst broad brush stroke assumptions of race (and names) in favour of the precision of economics.    The greatest problem of this work is that it draws no discernible link. What is the relationship between schoolteacher's cheating, bagels, sumo wrestlers, the naming of African American students, real estate agents etc etc? The book meanders to absolutely nowhere for 181 pages, then concludes by saying that this text should transform the entire way in which we view things.     To be honest, it is one of the weakest, most shallow and overrated works I have read for quite some time, despite all its self perceived 'quirkiness.'	2005-06-21

Anne Lamott has written some wonderful texts, namely 'Operating Instructions; a Journal of My Son's First Year'. However, she has really fallen short of the mark with this collection of essays on religion, American presidency and her family. <br /> <br />Essentially, the greatest flaw of the work is its mind-numbing repetition. It unfailingly reinterates the same points and covers the same material in each and every essay or article.  <br /> <br />Whilst I strongly agree with her endless tirade on George W. Bush and the state of American leadership, it does become slightly dull when repeated in every chapter. Similarly, I realise that she is angry at her mother and the behaviour of her son, but there is only so many times I can read about it. The work comes off as self-indulgent and Lamott herself is less likable in this work than her others. <br /> <br />Despite this, the text is beautifully written and does have a few topical highlights. These are generally the stories she shares about the unflinching beauty of others, such as 'Joice To The World' and 'One Hand Clapping'.    <br /> <br />It is for this reason I give the work three stars, although it undoubtedly left a sour and negative taste in my mouth.	2005-06-19

Really, I can't understand how anyone couldn't adore this book. It is wonderfully paced and written, and is inscribed with such a divine and important message for contemporary society and for those who wish to improve the quality of life in a highly industralised and urbanised world. It is both light reading and incredibly resounding.  <br /> <br />The author is likable and genuine and the work is at once personal and highly applicable. Honore does not pretend to be an expert on slowing down, and it is refreshing to read about his personal struggle with discovering a more managable and enjoyable speed of life.  <br /> <br />A previous reviewer took a star off for the fact that Honore attended a course while his daughter was sick. This is covered in all of five words in the text, and not really a genuine problem with the work. <br /> <br />My only complaint is that it is firmly entrenched and researched in Italy, the UK and USA. This tends to discredit the assumed universality of Honore's observations and makes it slightly less readable for non-European or American readers. <br /> <br />Despite this, it remains enjoyable and light, yet worthwhile.	2005-06-18

I have been a huge SARK fan for as long as I can remember, and have read and enjoyed all her marvellously and divinely coloured works.<br /><br />So, as much as I am inspired by her and the work she has done, I honestly believe that her earlier works are much more relevant, beautiful and divine than her latter ones. While I would absolutely recommend that everyone purchase a copy of 'Eat Mangoes Naked' and other titles, I can't help but tire slightly of her SARK font, when her actual writing was one of the most delicious parts about her books.  I guess I feel that the true beauty of SARK is so much more accessible within her earlier works, such as this, whereas the latter ones are undoubtedly that much more commericalised and repetitive.<br /><br />Along with 'Living Juicy', I believe that this is the best of the lot.

However, the work really failed to deliver.  <br /> <br />The main failure within the work was the unbearably obnoxious main character and first person narrative voice. In a coming-of-age work that is so dominated by a single character, it really helps to actually like him/her or care about their plight. But the reality was that the character of Wynter was unbearably and unwaveringly selfish and annoyingly self-absorbed. She is an utterly dislikable and one-dimensional character who probably doesn't actually deserve the likes of Mac. <br /> <br />I particularly loved when her and her friend made fun of an overweight person at a market, or when she tried to rid herself of her feelings for Mac by reminding herself that he was only a bartender and a college drop out. <br /> <br />Furthermore, the writing is frequently stilled and quite commonly tacky, particularly when Wynter is attempting to seduce. Perhaps a third person narrative structure would have been better suited and incited more character sympathy. <br /> <br />There are endless better books about food and finding love, and I would suggest that you seek them before wasting precious time with this work. <br /> <br />And if you really want to read it, get it from the library. <br />	2005-05-28

I suppose 'The Good Body' should stand alone and independent from 'The Vagina Monologues', yet the subjects are intrinsically linked and difficult to seperate.  <br /> <br />And this work just isn't as good. Isn't nearly as good. The monologues are a lot more forced and do not form a coherent and textualised whole. It doesn't have the same blend of humour, wit and poignancy of her earlier piece. <br /> <br /> I also feel that it needed more diverse experiences of body image across the entirity of the world, considering Ensler opens by saying that she traveled to forty countries to actually obtain information. The monologues of perhaps three non-American women are considered in this work, and as a non-American, it makes it that little bit more inaccessible and insular. <br /> <br />I can't help but want to give anything that actually considers the subject of female body image raving reviews. And this has its moments, particularly with the Indian treadmill lady and the ice cream eating Afghani women. But it is undoubtedly missing something, that little ingredient that could make a work like this incredibly powerful.	2005-04-14

Essentially, this is an interesting piece that is worthy of praise, but perhaps not the praise it has received. <br /> <br />It is nicely, (although not outstandingly) written and avoids undue sentimentalisation. However, its problems lie with the entirely unrealistic characterisations and some unnecessary repetition. <br /> <br />In the spirit of 'Sideways' or 'The Shipping News', you have to admire McLarty's heartening use of the bubbling overweight loser who makes good and becomes thinner in the process. While this is not a new literary trope, it never fails to entertain and hearten, because we can't help but see some of ourself in McLarty's protagonist. Similarly, the character of Bethany, with her poses, is equally appealing, although McLarty never really unfolds or examines the incensous undertones he gives this brother/sister relationship. <br /> <br />My problem was with the relationship between Smithy and Norma, and more pointedly, the dialogue between the two characters. Their exchanges are confused, inaccessible, muddled, incredibly disjointed, forced and entirely unbelievable. In a real-life situation, both would seem quite insane. In striving to create unique and somewhat quirky characters, I can't help but feel that McLarty has compromised the realism of the piece and the appeal of the work as a whole, and created individuals that too closely resemble Bethany, the insane character. <br /> <br />Furthermore, the book has the unpolished repetition of a writer without a great deal of experience. It is impossible to fathom how many times Smithy's banana consumption is mentioned, and this extends to a number of other aspects of the work. <br /> <br />Despite this, I would recommend this as an interesting but ultimately unpolished little work.	2005-03-02

Frankly, there is nothing revolutionary about it as a love story and the characters aren't particularly likable or realistic. Many of the romantic sequences feel somewhat forced and Niffenegger seems to be utterly fascinated by sex, though the sex scenes are quite repetitive, uninspiring and far from romantic. The continous sex scenes seemed to serve little actual purpose, and I particularly grimaced at the forced and irrelevant conversation between Henry and Claire about 'whether it was normal to have sex so often.'<br /><br />The first half is choppy and confusing at the best of times, while the events of the second half considerably weaken the tale. Furthermore, the parameters of Henry's time travel are not clearly explained, and thus it can be incredibly confusing attempting to work out where and when the narrative has shifted to.<br /><br />I am also suprised that everyone is so romanced by Henry. While it is undoubtedly a romantic little work, there are so many more charismatic and romantic literary characters and tales. Hard-drinking womanising Henry is aims  to appeal to every woman's desire to transform such an individual.<br /><br />Furthermore, the second half weakens the first. (SPOILER) Henry's death is far too drawn, which really minimalises the impact of it, and the ending is perhaps too rounded and complete.<br /><br />'The Time Traveller's Wife' is nothing more than an okay read with an interesting and unique premise. I wanted to love it, but again, I simply cannot understand the basis behind its mass appeal.	2005-01-06

This was a highly intricate and intriguing debut novel from Ann Packer, and one that I would readily recommend.    Beautifully paced and framed around the themes of love and loss, the work is an intimate characterisation of the pains of unrequited love. It is utterly addictive and beautifully written. It asks the reader to conceptualise forsaking their own dreams for the another, while offering a completely new angle on the question.    While many reviewers have argued against the book on the basis of the dislikable main characters, I believe that such characterisations adds to the humanity of the subjects and the work as a whole. While Carrie is cold and vacant at the best of times, Packer suggests that you can never really judge a situation like this until you are truly faced with it, nor is it fair to judge a person in such a situation without ever facing it. Furthermore, I believe Carrie realised that her New York sojourns were her last ditch attempt at freedom and had the intention of returning. Undoubtedly, Packer deserves credit for creating a work in which every single character differs from their counterparts.    My complaint, like other reviewers, is the seeming irrelevance and disappearance of certain characters, such as Carrie's gay friend Simon. What role was he supposed to play in the greater good of the story?    Despite this, a wonderful, worthwhile and entirely different read.	2005-01-03

This book was entertaining, short and basically pretty addictive. Much like chocolate itself.<br /><br />However, Almond's work was perhaps a little too short and a little too nothing for my tastes. It really lacked coherent intent, apart from the overriding attempt to seek smaller chocolate manufacturers within America. But there was little actually concluded or discovered.<br /><br />I disagree with other reviewers, I actually quite enjoyed the semi-autobiographic self-indulgence of 'Candyfreak'. This is partly the basis for its appeal. I did tire of Almond's subtle commentary of the exploitative practices of the industry, but his continued support of such practices.<br /><br />Essentially, there is not much more to say about the work because there is not much more to it.

'The Wishbones' is a sharp, witty and fast read, which doesn't cover any revolutionary territory or come to any deep worldy conclusions. However, it is entertaining enough and undoubtedly better than Perrotta's latter works, namely 'Little Children'. However, I did not think it was quite as good as most reviewers have suggested, simply because it doesn't draw itself out long enough to develop anywhere important. <br /> <br />Perrotta appears to have a deep seated fascination with sex and adultery, and for this reason, his collection of works are not entirely dissimilar and can lack the drive and purpose they should. His characterisations are wonderfully developed and wildly humourous, yet because the plot doesn't develop, you come to question the purpose of these fantastic side-characters. <br /> <br />Basicially, I felt that 'The Wishbones' was well-written and beautifully voiced, but that it failed to clearly articulate a purpose or sense of artistic depth.	2004-12-20

It is quite a shame that I am first to review this book, because it is a little gem, and Julia Darling is one author that warrants more attention then she may receive. Her first book, 'Crocodile Soup' is also a superb read. While they are both completely different novels, they are unusual and continously border on surrealism. <br /> <br />Darling perfectly blends tension and poetry in this piece. The characters are wonderfully intricate and the story is quite addictive, just as the writing is beautifully framed within their little slice of English working class domesticity. <br /> <br />Claris is a wonderful teenager and the interactions between her and family and the greater world is quite compelling. Similarly, her grandmother is beautifully wilted and her sister's struggle with her own identity is also intriguing. <br /> <br />However, I couldn't help but feel that the ending was a poor departure from the  piece. It just seemed too perfect and wonderfully rounded and therefore disjointed from the rest of the tale. I felt that something more in the line of 'Crocodile Soup' would better suit this work. <br /> <br />But overall, a fantastic and compelling read.	2004-11-29

Mixing surrealism and magic realism with the stark confronting realities of heartbreak and hardship, 'Crocodile Soup' is a magnificant and addictive little read and a individual find amongst lesbian centred fiction. It is particularly important to note that it is set in England, which gives it a unique and humourous voice amongst the predominantly American lesbian canon of literature. <br /> <br />The writing is quite poetically beautiful and somewhat reminscient of Lia Block's 'Dangerous Angels' series, though generally more pointed and less whimsical. I adored the short little chapters, which made this work quite a fast and enticingly simple but important read. <br /> <br />Additionally, the characters are utterly charming, whether they are likable or not. All the characters border on insanity (and some become so) and this lends the work an air of wonderful chaos and discord.

I have not read his first book, but was definitely disappointed with this work. It is an incredibly interesting and valid subject, and yet, Underhill merely superficially skims over the surface of it, with long transcripts of conversation and a barely discernible thesis which tends to meander as a chapter deals with a new subject related to malls. <br /> <br />Essentially, it is hard to know who Underhill is targeting with this work. Is he encouraging consumers to deconstruct mall environments, or illustrating how retailers and developers could improve profit by altering the layout and make up of malls? I get the impression it is the latter, and perhaps this is the reason that the book fails to stimulate, because only a small portion of its readership is likely to be developers/retailers. For this reason, 'The Call of the Mall' reads like an incredibly casual example of the reports he does for companies at good 'ole Envirosell. <br /> <br />Undoubtedly, 'The Call of the Mall' would be better written by an academic. I supposed I wanted cold hard facts, rather than Underhill's subjective observations, irrespective of his footing in retail study. And often, these observations seem somewhat naive and American-centric, particularly in the chapter relating to malls across the world. <br /> <br />Another thing that began to grate on my nerves was Underhill's obvious high esteem for himself and his own talent and wealth. While he balances this with a semblance of humour, it does get annoying. I particularly adored the discussion of a particular Japanese mall, which is near the 'Imperial Hotel' where 'he stays.' Is this meant to be relevant to the narrative or the purpose of the work? I think not. The book is teeming with these kind of discrete but encoded messages. <br /> <br />Overall, a focusless and somewhat boring work, that could have been great with a discernible direction and depth, some actual quantitive facts and less of an emphasis on Underhill's own subjectivities.	2004-11-23

'Strangers in Paradise' is an ode to the hidden depth and powerful beauty of women, irrespective of size etc. I think that is such an important message in contemporary times, and this series is incredibly empowering to actually read. <br /> <br />The art is beautiful and detailed and the storyline is gripping and completely addictive. This is a particularly good value buy, since all the 'Strangers in Paradise' books are correlated. The compilation is also an excellent way of developing a depth of understanding and appreciation for its entirity, while reading each edition tends to segement the series. The pocket book size is also wonderful and little, but meaty enough to have long hours curled up reading. <br /> <br />I am beginning to develop a few dislikes to the series, but certainly not enough to give it anything but five stars. Primarily, I think Katchoo is almost a caricature of herself, and her repetitive anger bursts are somewhat irritating and more aligned with the comic 'Hothead Paisan'. Undoubtedly, Francine is the better more realistic more developed character. <br /> <br />Irrespective of this, 'Strangers in Paradise Pocket Book 1' is a neatly correlated engrossing saga of friendship and so much more. Highly recommended.	2004-11-20

This book is incredibly difficult to review, simply because it is both the best and worst piece of writing you are likely to read this year. <br /> <br />You desperately want to like this book because of it's innovatively and beautifully written prose and its blindingly obvious potential. However, in the end, the bad repetitive and completely dull elements of this story win out above the interesting writing and all else that this book may offer. <br /> <br />Like a dykey 'Fear and Loathing in Los Vegas', Tea's stream of consciousness narrative examines the underbelly of 20th century Lesbianism in San Fransisco. While this is a fascinating subject, Tea manages to inject the work with such unbearable repetition ('We were all on drugs', 'I was avoiding this girl', 'My green hair', 'This girl kissed me in the bathroom' etc etc) and works so hard to push this book to the very edge of the lesbian counterculture.  <br /> <br />Was I meant to sympathise? Was I meant to care about this woman and her relationship/alcohol/drug issues? Probably not, but if I don't care about the subject of a book, I am unlikely to see it through to its conclusion to find out what happens. As many other reviewers have suggested, I couldn't help but wonder why this repetitive tale necessiated an entire book. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, I did stick with the mindless drug-hazed oblivion that was the conclusion, and came out none the wiser, but merely feeling as if Tea had played to a number of lesbian tropes and wasted my time on her drugs, mindless sex and green hair and latex gloves. <br /> <br />But nevertheless, beautiful prose never realised.	2004-11-19

I merely picked this book up on a whim, and discovered an amazing tale of friendship, both beautifully drawn and exceptionally realised. Brief, but hard to forget. <br /> <br />Winick's life has obviously changed after meeting Pedro, and I am suprised so many reviewers feel that he is capitalising on Pedro's death. Rather, Winick strikes me as having a great amount of love and admiration for his former friend, all the while using the comic medium to become a voice for Pedro's cause. Essentially the work is looking to promote AIDS awareness and direct a future that is increasingly knowledgable and embracing of non-normative sexualities. <br /> <br />The art is quite lovely; somewhat like Craig Thompson's 'Blankets', although the comic couldn't be more different. I thought the layouts were quite innovative and the whole piece was quite an achievement and obviously completely heartfelt, which is so uncommon in the comic genre. <br /> <br />However, I did feel that the time in the house was skipped over quite briefly to focus on his death. While the exploration of his demise was important, I think it is also essential to portray more of his household interactions, considering they were the basis for the friendship. <br /> <br />Additionally, the comic's cover is a real led-down point for Winick. It is poorly designed, old-fashioned and quite unappealing. It does not really exhibit the true wonder of this comic, which is a shame, because it is quite masterful. <br /> <br />Irrespective of this, I could not recommend this work enough. It is beautiful and deep, aching and gentle. I really admired it.	2004-11-17

This all-ages comic is relatively good. While it is not going to revolutionalise gothic-esque comic genre, it is better than Lenore and most others of its counterparts. <br /> <br />While the manga-style art is just lovely, particularly the frames when Courtney enters the non-human/faery world, the plot is a little meandering and quite weak and basic at times. While I have not read the follow-up works, which may include this element, I would have like to see Courtney explore her own magic a little more. Additionally, there was minimal interaction between Courtney and her grandfather, and yet we are meant to imagine that they had become close allies. <br /> <br />I did however feel that the character of Courtney was quite interesting and completely identifiable. Similarly, the parental characters were suitably ghastly and disinterested. <br /> <br />This is a short but cute enough read. If only there were more comics examining the same topic of magic and childhood isolation, just slightly more adult and fleshed out.	2004-11-17

This was my first foray into the 'Strangers in Paradise' series, and what an incredible series it is. Infact, it is one of the best comic works I have come across, and I recommend it highly. I am completely excited about reading the rest of Moore's collection and was sorry when this had finished.  <br /> <br />This pocket book is wonderful value and provides hours of entertainment. I am pleased to see that the series has been compiled, it is just too difficult to find the chronology of little books, and it was the release of these pocket books that inspired me to investigate 'Strangers in Paradise.' <br /> <br />The female characters are fleshed out, strong, very real, utterly likable and unlike the female caricatures so common in the comic genre. I particularly loved the high school portion of the work, which charters the beginnings of their intense friendship. As well the Xena story, which is also wonderful and quite funny. <br /> <br />Moore's work has a subtle gentle humour and he is quite amazing at nagivating the female psyche. While I wished I could have read the Pocket Book 1 first, it is not impossible to start a 'Strangers in Paradise' journey with this work.   <br /> <br />But I do suggest you begin it. It is such a wonderful comic.	2004-11-12

Well this is unlikely to revolutionise the graphic novel genre, it is a pleasant little collection of stories with lovely art and a great deal of gentle humour.    I thought the tales about he and his wife were particularly warming, while I also enjoyed the stories about his childhood and father and the measures he takes to mourn his father's passing. While they are all quite distinct stories, they really do narrate and flesh out a character, which is perhaps the ultimate aim of such a work. As I have said, the art is quite lovely, simple yet detailed and very sweet.    However, I had a few small problems with the work. Firstly, I found Beland to be an exceptionally Americanised voice, while his repetitive odes to McDonalds began to annoy me. Additionally, I found some of his strips slightly sexist, such as the one about 'chicks' ruining baseball  or the short story 'The Fem Tale'. While this was certainly not a conscious choice by Beland, it registered in my mind and made me appreciate the work a little less. Furthermore, there were quite a few stripes waxing lyrical about his success, his Einser nomination etc etc.    So while I really enjoyed the work for the most part, these repetitive aspects did grate on me and detract from the piece on the whole.	2004-11-09

Perhaps I missed the point with Lenore, but really, it seems completely and utterly overrated and I cannot understand why it is considered such a cult comic.  <br /> <br />While the art work is humourous and well drawn, Dirge completely ignores the necessity of plot. There is barely any story to be had, and when Dirge does write, his stories are rushed and uninteresting. While some the poems are compelling enough and actually quite innovative and the few stories about himself are quite good, the rest of the work based on Lenore was a complete anti-climax. <br /> <br />Purely for the art, and some of the small poems. To be honest, 'Johnny' and 'Bear' look like much more comprehensive versions of the same thing.	2004-11-08

This is a wonderful underground and quite subversive comic premised around overthrowing patriarchy and phallocentric society. DiMassa is witty and bold and clearly very angry with a world that has and continues marginalised women and create normalising barriers for non-hetrosexuals. <br /> <br />While the work is clearly tongue-in-cheek and based on exagerrated fantasy, the truth resonates, and DiMassa has a wonderful way of saying and doing exactly what all women have wished they could do. The characters are wonderful, particular Chicken, Hothead's lovely yoga-esque cat and her blind but centred friend Rox. It is definitely not as violent as I had imagined and much more plot driven, which is good. <br /> <br />The Complete work chronicles an entire comic, and while the work at the beginning is quite basic, the middle section is an absolute joy to read. However, the final section is somewhat patchy and difficult to follow, as Hothead slips into depression and seeming hallucination. The art progressively becomes more refined, and was very funny at times. <br /> <br />Overall, the entire piece was better than I expected, let down only by the confusion shrouding the final sections of the work. Nevertheless, a favourite comic collection of mine, to be read when I am feeling particularly inflamed by societal inequalities.	2004-11-06

It is hard to believe that one man created such an intricate textured and unbelievably timeless work such as this. By its conclusion, I was absolutely breathless, and it is undoubtedly one of the most divine graphic novels on the market today. It is well worth whatever money it may cost, simply because you  continously find something new within its pages each time you should explore and its depth and imaginative breath is quite astounding. <br /> <br />Ware's art is extraordinary and while his style is quite minimalist, the work has a number of other interesting features such as the cover and the inside sleeves.  The art is perfectly suited to the deadpan plot of the Corrigan tale, as he cleverly integrates overlaying plots and characters and uses his art to build characterisations without excessive dialogue. <br /> <br />How heatbreaking this work is, and how you ache for the socially inept Corrigan clan as they navigate through a life of disappointment and rejection. As many previous reviewers have suggested, the characters aren't entirely appealing, and yet, this does not detract from the narrative. It is unrealistic to like everyone in life, why would it be so in books? <br /> <br />Overall, just wonderful and a great addition to any graphic novel collection. My only complaint is that the work sometimes became confusing as it transfered narrative tales, and yet, this web is also quite artful and adds to the work as an entity.	2004-10-31

The Maus works are truly incredible, and I am not entirely sure I can add anything that hasn't already been mentioned in prior reviews.<br /><br />On initial sight, this book did little to attract my attention. The illustrations are clumsy and far less refined than the graphic novel standard. However, once you start reading, this is soon forgotten as you are swept into this heartbreaking tale.<br /><br />I am not sure I understand the concern with the animal caricatures, or the focus on Jewish history over the other suffering minorities during Nazi control. This is clearly a biography of a Jewish Polish man, who suffered because he was Jewish. It is only as bias as any biography, and this work should not be transposed into a non-fiction academic critique of the war. Thus concern over the drawings or the focus is completely illogical, because it is a personal tale with personal bias, and the fact that non-Jewish Polish suffered because of the war should not necessarily taint a Polish Jews' personal war experiences and perceptions.<br /><br />Overall, it is spectacularly powerful and incredibly varied and presents a unbiased portrait of a man with undoubted flaws and nuisances, while linking this to his life experiences and his son's development.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2004-10-26

I was incredibly excited about reading this, and while I am glad I did, I found it somewhat disappointing, particularly the latter half encompassing her move from Asia to Europe. <br /> <br />Infact, the first half is incredibly readable and interesting, and I admired her fearless approach to adventure and life. Perhaps it can also be consider her naivity, however, it makes for pretty consuming reading. I particularly found her Chinese and Nepalese travels compeling, and there is absolute heart and wisdom behind these words. <br /> <br />However, the second half in Europe was a complete and utter let down. Try as I may, I could not muster an inch of empathy for the person she had become. Previous reviewers have said that there was more to this work than sex, drugs and alcohol, but I would certainly disagree on the basis of the second half of the work. <br /> <br />While I am not criticising the text because of the possible objectionability of her choices (as illogical as they may commonly seem), the latter sections of the work seemed to dissolve into a random repetitive narration about the amount of drugs and alcohol her friends were consuming, as well as the methods used to obtain the aforementioned drugs and alcohol. Sure, I was interested in this initially, but it does get somewhat tiresome, and rather than empathising or admiring the courage of Gore (as I had intially done), I couldn't help but feel entirely apethetic. <br /> <br />While the final section of the work of her Italian pregnancy did improve somewhat as she seemed to stop drinking etc, it did little to alter the bitter taste left by her time in Amsterdam/London etc. While again, I did not necessarily see the logic in her choices, it makes for interesting enough reading. <br /> <br />Overall, I would recommend this work strictly within the confines of borrowing. Although it is divinely written and wonderfully descriptive,  I cannot necessarily see why her story would warrant an autobiography, considering much of it is spent discussing her choice of alcohol, cigarettes or hash. However, it proved somewhat interesting though entirely unmemorable reading.	2004-10-24

This is another wonderful Craig Thompson creation, beautifully executed and divinely imaginative travelogue of his trip around Morrocco, Spain, Paris etc for a book tour and to research his new comic. <br /> <br />As he suggests early in the work, this is not a follow on from his comics. It is not even like his glorious comics, but more like the gorgeous illustrated travelogues of Dan Price and Danny Gregory. <br /> <br />His drawings are just so detailed and fine, it is little wonder he suffers from debilitating joint problems. Everything he draws has little florishes, and I particularly thought some drawings of Gaudi's work in Barcelona were marvellous. His voice is kind and gentle, softly grateful and charming. At times it strikes me as too 'American', but he is conscious of the reputation of American travellers, and this does not really hinder the work. However, I did find his focus on women a little too repetitive for my liking. <br /> <br />I suppose this was where I was most disappointed with the work. While the trip seemed to be about pinning for a faraway love, he ended up sleeping with a random stranger at the end, which to me, seemed to undermind his whole purpose. It is not my place to criticise, it just confused things somewhat for me as a reader and responder, regardless of the fact that this is a personal account and I wondered to myself what he came away with at the end of this adventure. <br /> <br />And as another reviewer has suggested, it does end quite randomly, and is quite short. I would have liked to seen what followed. <br /> <br />However, the pictures potentially have hours of observation, with their detailed beauty. Irrespective of any perceived flaws, it is worthwhile and fascinating.	2004-10-20

His drawings are absolutely maginficant in both this and 'Blankets', and his tales are sweet and utterly likable. I daresay, at the tender age of 28, Thompson has some wonderful years of graphic novels writing ahead and we are in for some divine and quirky treats. <br /> <br />This little work is bittersweet and kind and sensitive and beautifully texturised. It is also quite a novel concept for this genre, and I daresay I have read no graphic novel which even lends itself to some kind of comparison. Its just delightfully simple and there is so much in the artwork. Every glance warrants a new discovery, and Thompson is already a master at evoking feeling. I particularly loved the frames where Chucky and his mouse love were lying under a quilted blanket and Chunky was telling her not to cry. Just gorgeous. <br /> <br /> <br />However, the work is relatively short and can be difficult to follow. It is not flawless, but remains a timeless addition to any graphic novel collection. 'Blankets; is clearly Thompson's incredible and unusual masterpiece, and while both are worth getting, 'Blankets' illustrates how Thompson has developed as a writer and artist in the last four years. <br /> <br />That said, I would still highly recommend 'Good-bye, Chunky Rice.' It stands alone as utterly beautiful work and a gentle and innovative credit to the graphic novel genre.	2004-10-18

Honestly, it is just so truthful and aching and divine. The drawings are simply magnificant, detailed and funny and innovative. Thompson is an incredible artist and writer, and the story is as sensitive and brave as the drawings. Craig (within the story!) is a truly endearing and soft character, and I really felt like Thompson had laid bear his heart and soul, with all its bruises and tender bits. I did not want it to end so quickly, though at 600 beautiful pages, it is good value.    I felt that the blanket tied the work together in one marvellous cohesive tapestry and that other characters were beautifully explored and texturised. The work as a whole is calming and gentle and Thompson evokes a real sense of teenagehood, first love and icy icy weather.    My only, very picky complaint is that as a non-religious individual, I found the work to be, on occasions a little too religious. Additionally, I felt that Thompson could have characterised Raina in a less idealised and more human manner.     Irrespective of this, I really really adored 'Blankets', and it shall sit under my bed for morning inspiration and balance and a peaceful feeling of calm.    If only the world was full of works like 'Blankets', I am sure we'd all be happier more peaceful people.	2004-10-17

Satrapi's 'Persepolis' is an absolutely amazing read and one that was completely surprising and quite unassumingly wonderful. I honestly cannot recommend it enough and can't wait to read 'Persepolis 2.' <br /> <br />It is just such a rare, warm, brutally honest, humourous and heartbreaking work that is completely enlightening. It is a revolutionary use of comic genre, and completely dissimilar to anything I have previously encountered. <br /> <br />There is such tenderness between its pages, yet also such strength. I finished it tearful, partly because the incredible journey was over and partly because I felt grateful to have encountered something so unlike contemporary media.  The illustrations are simple yet humourous and profound, much like the work as a whole. <br /> <br />There is not much else to say, except I wish I could start over again not having read it, and perhaps I shall try. I suggest that you too give this glorious work a chance.	2004-10-15

'Nickled and Dimed' is from that wonderful subcatergory of enlightening social non-fiction that is beginning to pop up and entertain and inform. Among this works are the massly popular 'Fast Food Nation'. <br /> <br />And it is both entertaining and informative. In many ways, it is the most entertaining of its kind because it relies on a social experiment to make it point rather than endless eventually-meaningless facts. Rather, Ehrenreich has scattered important and enlightening facts throughout the work, but the emphasis is not random facts but actual individuals. However, the factual evaluation sucessfully ties in the entire work and is excellently written and researched. <br /> <br />I felt that Ehrenreich should have considered one more place/job, because the actual experiment ends on a low and somewhat meandering note when she is unable to succeed in Minnesota. I perhaps thought three was too few, though I understand that the story is likely to repeat itself in every city/township across America. <br /> <br />Finally, I like many other reivewers, would like to point out a majorly annoying flaw about the work. The fact that Ehrenreich continously mentions her education. Anyone would think she was the first person to get a pHD. She seems suprised that her workmates are not stunned by the fact she is so educated. I gather they have more important things to concern themselves with. She is also liable to mention her roots and her father's job, as if it makes her that much more empathetic with the situation of low-paid workers now they she exists in another social class entirely. Certainly, the work is still infused with the fact that Ehrenreich has another life, but this is perhaps inescapable. <br /> <br />I found this to be a real sticking point, and I occasionally wonder whether it undermined or blurred the purpose of the work. <br /> <br />Still, short, readable, entertaining and ultimately enlightening.	2004-10-12

This book has a number of serious flaws, but I still think it is an interesting and worthwhile account of a brave tale of serious wanderlust. <br /> <br />Firstly, as many reviewers have suggested, it does get slightly repetitive and boring, and tends to become increasingly so in the section after Rita visits Israel and settles in Bali. I also noticed that some parts of the work are quite poorly edited, with details and facts repeatedly mentioned, though I did not necessarily see any problems with the writing style itself. The work was however, slightly too long. By the end, my interest was undoubtedly declining. <br /> <br />Additionally, as another non-American has mentioned, this is quite an America-centric tale with a very America voice and the obvious assumption that every reader is American. It becomes quite annoying as a result. I think this became particularly noticable and irritable when Rita was in New Zealand, and harped on the differences in speech and made a point of stopping her teaching to ask exactly how something was pronounced. How infuriating. <br /> <br />Another point I want to make is that Rita continously ignores the fact that the people she visits and becomes 'friends' with, are from poverty-striken nations, and that their poverty is directly proportional to how much Western nations (like America) have pillaged from the resources of their country. I guess I was somewhat skeptical about how close the ties actually were between Rita and Mexicans etc in the eyes of the non-Americans, but that is only my judgement. <br /> <br />However, there are some redeeming features of the work, which partly stem from her very clear passion for travel and for people. I particularly thought the section in Mexico and other South/Central American nations was fascinating. I also thought that her Vancover section was quite interesting, though I do wish she had explored a little of what the city etc is like, rather than continously harping on her number of friendsand her need to travel again.	2004-09-27
US	50657718	R148Q80MGME35V	0671532766	94824442	Lizard	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Perhaps her best..	Having read all Yoshimoto's thin pieces over a month or so, I can honestly say that this was perhaps her most developed emotional and divinely written work. It tended to stray from her reoccuring occasionally repetitive Gen X themes, but rather, appealed to something more fudamental within. <br /> <br />I was less impressed with what I suppose were her showstopper stories - 'Lizard' and the final piece abot spiritual awakening by the river, but rather, I found the middle stories delightful little tidbits of hope and humour and gorgeously sensual writing. What is it about Yoshimoto's female characters that make them so utterly goddess-like and interesting? I think her characterisation particularly shines in this little volume. <br /> <br />I still think that Yoshimoto is not necessarily furfilling her so obvious potential, but I think this is the first of her works that is even close to satisfying her ability. It is for that reason I would perhaps recommend reading 'Lizard' last (despite it being one of her earlier works) because it shows something much deeper and more emotionally elaborate than the slightly overrated 'Kitchen' or anything else and suggests her great development as a writter. <br /> <br />Still, I also recommend 'Kitchen' and 'Goodbye Tsugumi', while I would probably skip 'NP' and the others, given another chance.	2004-09-27

As many people have suggested, this work is no where near as good as her older works like 'Living Juicy' and 'Inspiration Sandwich.' Those were deep rich colourful pieces, and while this is still colourful, it does feel a little more souless and a little less rich than the rest. <br /> <br />However, I am suprised many old Sark fans thought that it was such a disappointment. Of course its the same as the last works, she is the same woman growing in the same way! I guess some of the stories do feel a little reguitated and I miss her many personal stories (which she has probably run out of by now) but I didn't find it disappointing as such. <br /> <br />I agree, there are probably far too many references, but her chapters on inspiration and adventures were jems. I loved the story of the traped ladybug as a metaphor for her aging mother, just as I adored the tale of the well dressed drunken man. <br /> <br />I only wish Sark's more recent works was as rich with these idosyncratic little stories that made her older works so delightful. <br /> <br />Additionally, I was pleased to note that this work is not in Sark typeface (as her previous work was), but her traditional handwriting style which makes it feel that little more personalised and lovely and a little less like a Sark industry. <br /> <br />I recommend it for long time Sark lovers, but suggest that new-comers pick up 'Living Juicy', 'Inspiration Sandwich' or even 'Succulent Wild Woman.' Or better yet, read them both, but buy the older works and borrow this one from the local library.	2004-09-20

Although I have been reading a lot of Yoshimoto, there is something continously unsatisfying about her works, and this is no exception. Perhaps thats why I continously read them, seeking that book which finally satisfies. Her masterpiece, or whatever you wish to call it. <br /> <br />I don't necessarily want to the works to be conclusive, I like their delicacy and gentle flow..so I can exactly put my figure on what it is or why it so frustrates me. <br /> <br />I guess I feel as if they could be so much more. So much greater than the sum of their gentle little parts. There could be so much more she develops, in her wistful way. But rather, there is an emptiness which permeates throughout her works. <br /> <br />I accept that this her style, but Murakami is a perfect example of an author who taints his work with the same emptiness, but something more ebbs beneath. I just don't really get that impressive with Yoshimoto. The tales are lovely and delicate and divine, but mostly face value. <br /> <br />However, this is undoubtedly one of her finer works, along with 'Kitchen' and better than 'N.P' and 'Asleep.' I was really hoping that she was going to embrace one of those short stories of hers and write a full length novel, but this work definitely differed in its content from the other works. Though the gorgeous whimsical style remained. <br /> <br />I thought the descriptions of the seaside town and the salt air were utterly captivating. I do wish that Tsugumi's sister had been more throughly explored and that the ending was just slightly more appealing, because the beginning is quite entrancing. <br /> <br />Though, of course, I will read the rest of her works, waiting for that masterpiece. Because when it comes, its going to be something quite extraordinary.	2004-09-17

Just as other reviewers have suggested, how unusual and wonderful to find a work that is perhaps more poignant and fudamental to modern life than when it was first published in the 1950s. How significant for a woman of that time to wax lyrical on the need for female solitude and independence. <br /> <br />This is a tiny sweet little book whose narrative is framed by the beauty of nature and the complex lessons of shells. I loved her description of the day shared by lovers, from waking in the morning to walking and working and watching the stars. Her lessons were perfectly applicable and inspiring. <br /> <br />Essentially, Lindbergh is also suggesting that women slow themselves, which has become more relevant in this epoch. On bad days, she suggests baking biscuits, something which warmed my heart. <br /> <br />The only limitation of this little work is that it, at times, is restricted by the constructs of its periods. For example, as Lindbergh suggests in the 'Reopening' of the work, women are even still a long way from the equality she initially describes. My only other minor complaint is that she occasionally simplifies the intricate complexity of relationships. <br /> <br />But even still, I am off to bake some biscuits.	2004-09-14

I am such a huge fan of visual journals, and looking at the divine binding of this book, I figured it was another to find its place among my vast collection of distinctive gorgeous colourful journals. <br /> <br />However, I don't think that Danny Gregory's work is quite as good as similar pieces on the market. While it is has some wonderful drawings and some heartfelt ideas, there is not necessarily as much substance as you might find in other books. <br /> <br />I particularly loved the drawings and thoughts on Gregory's European trip, but to be honest, I found many of his observations to be very American, or at least American-centric. Considering he was raised in England and other parts of the world, this was a disaapointing shock.  <br /> <br />Not only that, I thought many of his considerations had undertones of the privledged vastly cynical urbanite. While I did sympathise with his struggles, I imagine I would have liked the work more if this current did not exist and I felt like he actually embraced the purpose of his title. The often cycnical commentary and his greater ideals about quiet art just did not seem to correlate. <br /> <br />It was a lovely adventure into how partners deal with the debilitating inflictions of their loved ones, but I really prefer the calm kind journals of Dan Price, whose drawings Gregory is evidently also inspired by.	2004-09-11

I feel really bad writing this, because Sabrina has been one of the biggest inspirations to me, and my copies of her previous works are dog-earred and completely pre-loved. <br /> <br />And I was utterly unbearably excited about this one. So I sat down with a nice rich hot chocolate and a spare hour.. <br /> <br />The truth is though, I truly don't think this work is as good. Not to say I regret buying it or I wouldn't recommend it, but I suggest that people do not expect another 'Spilling Open.' <br /> <br />I feel like a lot of pages are wasted. There is a huge amount of photography, and some are truly beautiful works, but others are completely uninspiring and seem like page-fillers. What seems like endless pages of out-of-focus buildings and blocks of colours. This is particularly so with the first half of the book, though the second half does improve as she moves from New York. <br /> <br />Additionally, the other works contained a discernible story, or a  gradual coming-of-age or at least, the progress of her life could be followed. This stops as quickly as it begins. The pages do not progress from each other and you get absolutely no sense of her and her common tribulations, which was what made the other books so divine. When she does write, the words are so close together and fumbled that it makes reading sentences somewhat difficult. <br /> <br />Sabrina seems to want to move into books of straight art rather than journals, and I am not suggesting that she revert to something that no longer appeals to her. Perhaps though, it should be remembered what was so appealing and original about the first books. If I wanted a book of photography, I could have found a million of those. If she wants to make an art or photography book, I just feel she shouldn't hide behind the guise of a journal, which this is really not.  <br /> <br />It just seems very detached, far less intimate and colder than her previous works. Far less fumbling, but far far less appealing.	2004-09-09

While McCall's sixth in the Ladies Detective Agency series has all the traits of the first; relaxing simplicity, rich descriptions, delightfully gentle prose and bush tea, I find myself enjoying each work less and less. <br /> <br />Though it is still exceptionally reader, the characters have steadily become less appealing. Perhaps it is because the novelty of their simplified responses has worn off. I think moreover, I enjoyed the focus on the detective stories, and this element of McCall's work has taken a backseat for character tribulations. <br /> <br />Still, a Sunday afternoon and four cups of tea can melt away happily with this simple and gentle little narrative. As long as the book is borrowed and one doesn't expect some dramatic life change or to remember the work in a week.	2004-09-04

Having devoured Huraki Murakami, Yoshimoto seemed like the next progressive step. <br /> <br />And really, they do have some similarities. There is something beautifully refreshing about their aloof, sweet descriptive style and their covert intellectualism. <br /> <br />However, Yoshimoto's works seem to lack a certain something, a certain zest or life. While they are compulsively addictive, they tread so lightly as to be almost unmemorable. <br /> <br />'Y.P' is certainly less impressive than her tiny bestseller 'Kitchen'.  In both works, there seems to be a lovely layer of foggy glass between the reader and the characters, yet in 'Y.P', this is tainted by a sense of distachment from the work. <br /> <br />I found myself liking the book, enjoying the descriptions and the complexity of the characters, but not really caring about the outcome.  <br /> <br />'Kitchen' is undoubtedly the better read.	2004-08-30

It is rare that I would say this about a book, but 'Guarding the Moon' is something that I would have been a better person without reading.<br />I like Lia Block's work, in small doses. 'Dangerous Angels' is a wonderful and divinely written young adult series, if not somewhat repetitive. More recently, 'Echo' was beautifully written, if not even more of the same thing.<br />But this is absolutely terrible. I mean every word of that.<br />The names she calls her child are absolutely cringe-worthy, and come off as pathetic and repetitive rather than sweet. She is<br />utterly self obsessed, has a fascination with her own phobias, weight, apple sweetened food and self esteem (and thinks that her readers do too.) The way she smothers her child is unhealthy, and to be honest, I walked away from the work wondering if she was psychologically imbalanced.<br />The writing is undoubtedly lyrical and lovely, if not a little repetitive as many of her works are.<br />However, I will perhaps never read a Lia Block book again knowing how overbearing and annoying her personality really is.<br />I certainly do not recommend this book, and I believe it is possibly the worst possible way to introduce yourself to her writing.	2004-04-24

Neil Gaiman has always said this is his best comic, and I find that really hard to believe. I would think that much of the 'Sandman' series is far superior in terms of plot and characterisations.<br />It is a shame that the script has let this work done, because the artwork is probably the best I have ever seen for a comic/graphic novel, and certainly more appealing than 'Sandman'. Divinely textured, with incredible breath and detail, McLean's (responsible for the Sandman covers) work is truly incredible. The puppet photography is an innovative idea, and the portraits of the boy are also fantastic. The photography of the grandfather's hands also resonates, and overall the work has a wonderfully finished appeal.<br />However, the series is too short and underdeveloped, and the characterisations are weak. I had difficulty telling several of the characters apart, while it does have that beautiful dark mystical quality I would come to expect with Gaiman.	2004-03-27

'Her blood is Gold' is a wonderful take on a subject of which, I, like most women, have given little thought to, except for the occasional dispair.<br />An extremely fast and uncomplicated read, it is essentially an exploration of various misognist treatments of women and their monthly 'curse', and how we as women can come to accept and love with periods, rather than just live with them.<br />The crux of the work is the idea that women are in the prime of their creativity during menstruation, and thus should take time off to explore this blessing. It also offers helpful monthly rituals and a divinely liberating ode to bellies. Additionally, there is a brief history of menstruation and its link to the goddess.<br />I was throughly absorbed in this work, however I have a minor issue with the piece. I found it almost a case of reverse sexism, and wondered to myself, when do men get their time off?<br />Additionally, I felt it played into the hands of prehistorical greek notions of women as 'fevered' and liable to insane outbursts of emotion.<br />Perhaps I found that where it did not exist, but regardless, I thoughly enjoyed this informative feminist work.	2004-03-27

The 'Kindly Ones' is where is the climax of the Sandman series takes place and the break down of Morpheus's realm begins. It is also slightly more sassy and somewhat more complicated and plot-based then earlier works like 'Season of Mist' and ''Brief Lives.'<br />This is quite possibly the worst Sandman to begin on, and is about the only Sandman work which really requires complete reading of earlier volumes. There is little in the way of character exploration itself, and background knowledge is certainly assumed.<br />However, there is such beauty in the sheer magnificence of the artwork, the intensity of the plot and the wonderful way in which eight volumes worth of characters are brought back to life.<br />'The Kindly Ones' is an integral part in any Sandman library, and is both a superb read and a marvellous conclusion to an simply amazing series.	2004-02-24

This is definitely not the best Gaiman work, nor is it even close to the standard of Sandman.<br />While it is quite a good read, it is very quick with little depth, with a completely bizarre introduction from Tori Amos, and the character of Death is not quite the powerhouse woman I imagine from Sandman. Lets not forget the unusual end section regarding unsafe sex..of all things. The graphics are generally below the standard of Sandman, and the supporting cast are very poorly explored.<br />Both she and Sexton are quite cute characters, and her brief offering of life is nice touch. Cute again, even. This is what Death; the cost of living remains...one of the shallower cuter parts of the Sandman. I am suprised Gaiman did not expand the story, it definitely had the potential.	2004-02-23

This was an excellent read, if not sold simply because of the vivid colourful Latino descriptions of the people, the persusaive sense of the fire of Latin America, and of course, the constant, often coarse, sex scenes.<br />It was such a bittersweet book, such an undercurrence of sadness and loss. It was essentially, a lament to old age and wasted youth. The detail is incredible, the emotions very real. It effectively captures the horrible sinking inevitability of death.<br />Hijelo's characters are wild, if not dislikable. This is perhaps the finest point of the piece; the characters are utterly human and terribly flawed. <br />Cesor's incredible libedo is at the forefront of the work, and there is a sense of humidity, sweat and the smells of sex that pervade the work. Hijelo should be admired for being able to conjuer up such senses. I found it a sensual read, however I disagree with many who describe the sex as sensual. It seemed very coarse, but this is not a criticism, it served its coarse purposes.<br />The only criticism I have is the distracting nature of many of the sex scenes. The sheer amount of them seemed somewhat unnecessary, however, they began to fade once Cesar aged.<br />Over all, innovative and superb.	2004-02-21

Isabel Allende is by far my favourite author, and I had always thought that 'Paula' was my favourite of her works.<br />However, stepping back from her books for sometime, then re-reading 'Paula' recently, I have had mixed feelings regarding the work.<br />The piece strikes me as somewhat more repetitive then I remember. While I completely understand a mother's love and the sorrow Allende must have felt during this period, her laments are almost word-for-word repetition. By far, the more interesting section of the book is that related to the family history and specifically, Paula's personality and place in the family scheme of things. Additionally, the continous use of similar metaphors and talk of spirits begins to wear down on even the most devoted of fans.<br />Paula's condition is never explained, and while I understand that it is as simple as a websearch, I felt that it was a major oversight to put it in relation to the context of their family. <br />Likewise, I felt that Paula's life was discussed too little, and Isabel's perhaps too much. Of course, it was Isabel's attempts to make sense of something completely senseless, and thus we can hardly blame her from trying to think of things unrelated to her daughter and ensuing sorrow.<br />A final criticism, much of the material covered in 'Paula' is again covered in Allende's 2003 biography 'My Invented Country'. If anything, 'Paula' serves as a suitable testment to the woman's extraordinary life.<br />Don't get me wrong, the work is still of four star quality. The writing is vivid, spiritual and alive, the story is un-put-down-able, emotions are wrenched from within, and the piece has a round cohension of which I truly admire.	2004-02-21

Everyone loves these books, and no one can really narrow down why they are so utterly lovable.<br />It would say it is in part due to the sheer simplicity of the writing, the divine descriptions of nature and the beauty of the image McCall Smith portrays of Botswana. The foriegn-ness of the themes and the exotic-ness of the main story relating to the witch doctor, as well as the colours and life of the covers.<br />Additionally, the lovability of characters, particularly the main character, with her completely un-Western notion of the body beautiful, her enduring sensitivity regarding the death of her baby and her enchanting love of her father. The devotion of her fiance is also gorgeous.<br />Perhaps the appeal of these works is the fact they suggest a fundamental life we essentially aspire for. Simplicity, kindness, nature, beauty. Such a different life than we of the Western world.	2004-02-21

In small doses.<br />And yet, I really have little to say about this book except that while you are reading it, it is difficult to put down. The debachary, the sex, the music, the lesbianism all conspire to make it something quite different.<br />That said, it leaves you with a sour taste in your mouth and unsatisfied sigh. There is something very premediated about the whole thing, and like other reviewers have suggested, Sarah Water's main downfall is her desire to create the lesbian novel of the 21st century. Its just that little bit too long to maintain.<br />Infact, I have to wonder how original her other two works are considering they, like this one, are long 19th century Cockney lesbian fiction.	2004-02-21

I had always been somewhat resistant when faced with the prospect of reading Maya Angelou's 'I know why the caged birds sing'. Perhaps it is the fact that it graces so many high school reading lists, and I remember the sense of dread of having to cram in a somewhat dull-ish book in a hour or two before an exam.<br />But within a week and a half of reading this, I devoured the rest of her autobiographies with a mixture of such fascination and revulsion. Revulsion at the inhumanity, but taken by the beauty of Angelou's own humanity when dealing with those who oppress. The shear force of her womanhood is startling.<br />In some little way, I would go as far to say that this book has altered me, as I imagine it has altered many who have spent an evening curled up, turning page after perfect page.<br />Perhaps I feel more, I empathise a little more, perhaps I understand the process of self-acceptance a little better. Writing in itself is such a introverted period of self examination, and yet oddly, this book has the subtle power to suggest that the reader examine themselves. <br />It really is that brilliant, and certainly one i could have devoured at least a day before the exam.	2004-02-21

I am steadily working my way through the entire series, in rough chronlogical order, and I must say that I am most impressed with 'Brief Lives'.<br />The artwork is varied, humourous and colourful, yet unintrusive. The oddly charming character of Delirum is truly fascinating and Dream is finally revealed to have somewhat of a soft side. Additionally, it has the coherance the earlier volumes lack.<br />'Brief Lives' returns to or introduces a staggering amount of characters. One must admire the manner in which Gaiman introduces 'brief lives' of new characters, and later disposes of them, yet tells us just enough to build our affections. This is particularly evident in this member of the series. For example, the character of Isatar is meerly alluded to, and yet her wisdom, dance sequence (and the change in the artwork) is delightful. As is the devoted cynicism of Destruction's dog.<br />While it may not be the best introduction to Sandman, it is certainly one to look forward to while reading the earlier editions.	2004-02-21

Flicking through and considering the wildly beautiful artwork for stories like 'Ramadan', I imagined 'Fables and Reflections' to be the serie's finest point.<br />The notion of the work is an excellent one. Nine stories, each completed by different artists and each portraying a historical event with a little Sandman twist.<br />However, the execution of the work leaves a little to be desired. For the most part, the stories are anti-climatic, slow and irrelevent. Perhaps the only pieces that can stand alone are the whimisical 'The Hunt' and the tale of lost love, 'Orpheus'. Elsewhere, there is little of Gaiman's usual originality to be found.<br />'Fables and Reflections' is clearly not a great starting point for delving into The Sandman. I would, however, recommend 'Seasons of Mist', 'Brief lives' and 'The Kindly ones.'	2004-02-20

This book is a simply written, somewhat shocking read of teenage drug addiction and the seemingly ingradual process of innocence to innocence lost through unbearably addictive heroin. <br />It is a grossly easy, fast and hugely enthralling read, and like previous reviewers, I was throughout the work reminded of the superb 2000 film 'Reqiuem for a Dream'. Similarly, 'Smack' documents the fallout of innocent somewhat naive characters into a frighting drug underworld of prostitution and crime. <br />Put simply, the piece is really about the brief passage of time between control and addiction, and suggests that even the most seemingly in control can never understand when and why the boundaries between enjoyment and sickness have crossed over.<br />The demise of the characters is both disturbing and frightening, especially Tar, who eventually comes to represent the cold brutality he so despises in his father. This again suggests that no one can ever truly be in control, that we are all one step, one injection away from chaos, that we are all non practicing addicts. It is a scary thought, certainly, and the composer illustrates how heroin addiction can take place in a mere matter of weeks.<br />The book, while beyond tame in comparison to the utterly disturbing and life changing 'Reqiuem for a Dream', still contains images that will forever play in your head. A teenage addict calming her addicted child by putting grains of heroin in<BR>her gums, for example.<br />However, I found the book slightly simplistic in the approach to drugs in general. It suggests that all drugs like marijauna will certainly lead to heavier things and dependencies, and whilst many do, a great proportion do not. Thus this forms the basis of my four star rating.<br />Despite this tiny flaw, this is a completely valuable and worthwhile read and a superb portrayal of the horrors of drugs. It illustrates how fine that line is between in and out of control is.	2001-12-29

Dan Eldon, like many previous reviewers have suggested, led an awe inspiring life which is should be a model to slackers (like myself) everywhere.<br />He crammed a lifetime of experience in to 23 short years, and what most people wouldn't give to be as creative, as charming and as entertaining as the marvellous Dan Eldon, whose work has changed the life of many, myself included.<br />'The Journey is the Destination' unconciously attacks the notion of capitalism and discourages the plight of capitalist man, illustrating the beauty and lessons that can be learnt from travelling, from the ability to see beyond the selfish concerns of the modern world. It both challenges first world notions through the use of startling, yet beautiful visions of forgotten Africa and opens reader's eyes up to the marvels that can be discovered on this sprawling earth, if only we peer a little harder.<br />Similar to such artists as Candy Jernigan and Sabrina Ward Harrison, he effectively and subtly uses various mediums to explore his emotions and display his interests. His early pages and his inital trips around his beloved Africa use colour and complex collages to best illustrate the complexity of the continent. In contrast, the final pages filled with war stricken images of Somalia, are simple and shocking, and this best explores the nation in which his final breathe was taken, and perhaps Dan's belief that no collage could or should dress and reduce the immensity of the images and the horrors of hate.<br />There is always a distance placed between the imaginative and slightly wacky Eldon and the reader, and Dan Eldon's belief that 'I share my house with my room mate, I'll share my book with you, but my head is my own' rings true in the work.<br />I do however, wish there some way in which we could know where and what part of his life he was in when writing journal portions, though most parts are evident by the abudent and colourful pictures and art.<br />Whilst we can never entirely know what he was thinking or the personal significance of the images in the piece, I consider myself lucky to be given the opportunity to glance into this amazing character's mind, if only for a mere two hundred and fifty pages.<br />Equally, I would consider you unwise to pass up the opportunity to do so.	2001-12-16

Of particular interest was the horrific story of Kenny, who has had the worst luck in all of history, most of it due to uncaring captialist manipulative Fast Food outlets like McDonalds and their dispictable hygiene deficient meat suppliers like Montfort.<br />Certainly, there are better and more interesting parts to the work, for example, the initial facts regarding the USA's expenditure on Fast Food ($110 billion. Billion!), Scholsser's visit to the Smells factory, as well as the information and case studies on the E Coli virus and its link with the substandard and dangerous operating techniques of the meat packing industry.<br />There are also areas in which the author is overly biased, for example, in his analysis of the industry's terribly reduced pay packet and its horrific workplace standards, he neglects the fact that a job is better than nothing at all. Additionally, the extremely detailed and factual look into the meat industry can be infuriating drawn out, though the case studies and his visit to factories are startling and interesting.<br />Whilst the author clearly knocks the industry and those associated with the production of fast food, he primarily shifts the focus onto the consumers who, through purchasing, allow substandard conditions, marketing manipulation and scandals in the industry to occur. Additionally, he provides various case studies of businesses who are doing it right, like Jack in the Box, who thorugh an E coli fright, have righted many safety wrongs in the organisation.<br />He not only documents the amazing climb of fast food andconcentration of fast food purchasing in America, he also parellels it with the growth in other industries like Disney, and there is an apocalyptic sense to the work, for indeed, as McDonalds and Hungry Jacks force out all smaller providers, the best is yet to come.<br />However, this book is a little unsuitable for those outside of America, for it deals solely with American practices, and gives little indication whether worldwide practices in places like Australia differ even minutely. Regardless, with globalisation running amuck, it is relevant to all nationalities who consume fast food with almost equal vigor.<br />With that fact aside, this is a provacative, researched, well written, somewhat amusing and startling work with traces of sad sentimentialism, and is one of the better and more worthwhile books I have read during 2001.	2001-12-16

The humour of 'Fight Club' is clearly translated to this work, yet it is structurally more mature and innovative, and considerably darker and nihlistic than the forementioned, if such a feat is possible.<br />Initially, it was impossible to put down, however I felt that the novel lacked its early vigor in the mid section. I also felt that the ending was mildly predictable, and that Palahniuk's constant climatic tone lead to a somewhat anti climatic conclusion.<br />However, clearly, the composer deserves immense praise for his amazingly cynical style and his criticisms of man's fickle ability to adapt and readapt; to turn a martyr into a murderer and to naively fall for the falsities of marketing and materialistic and slightly self-improving nature of modern man. <br />I was taken by the interesting manner in which the author counted backwards, and found the characters, though somewhat distant and unobtainable, exciting and bordering on insanity.<br />The above description of the characters, in retrospect, is a fine description of one of the most nilistic and cold books I have completed this year, and whilst it is no 'Chocolat' or Oprah best seller, it is a fresh and innovative style of writing by an author with weighty talent and a cyncial twinkle.	2001-12-03
US	50657718	R2JDUYKYDJV6GD	067946333X	477028395	Fury: A Novel	Books	4	7	8	N	N	An excellent book, but a disappointing Rushdie book.	With Rushdie, it is difficult to avoid taking into account the sheer magnificance of other older works when reviewing or discussing 'Fury' and his other, more recent novels.<br />And thus, while this is a brillantly crafted and executed novel, razor sharp with an objective portrayal of a variety of characters, it was somewhat of a disappointment, and a break away from the Magic Realism of 'The Moor's Last Sigh' and 'Midnight's Children' of which Rushdie does best.<br />I felt that Rushdie's gritty fury filled New York setting was superbly portrayed, and like previous reviewers, found a seriously apocalyptic element to the work, and the fury developing within the city and the world at large. This was particularly accentuated by the cussing taxi driver and I can also see an element of 'King Lear' in the sticky surrounding and its mirroring of the character's inner chaos.<br />However, also like previous reviewers, I felt Rushdie's attempts to westernise his work with references of well know writers, films etc lacked a certain tact and delicacy that Rushdie has become known for. It seemed almost an attempt to prove that Rushdie himself had given in to the Western world.<br />I found the climatic and insightful conclusion to be a highlight of the novel, and this amazing finishing seems to be one of the only things that Rushdie has brought to his new work. <br />This is a harder, leaner, more realistic and incrasingly gritty novel, and I would be inclined to say not one of his better works, though is an interesting and worthwhile read from an objective viewpoint or someone who is yet to experience the beauty that is 'The Moor's Last Sigh' etc.	2001-11-19

I was initally attracted to this novel by the its comparison to the marvellous writings of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, having previously read only the bestseller 'Daughter of Fortune.'<br />Clearly, Magic Realism is an important element in this work, and it does bare resemblance to the works of the forementioned, but there is something about this work that left me mildly disappointed.<br />I adored the characters, particularly the gorgeous Mimi, and of course Eva herself, yet I would have liked to learn more about Rolf, who was presented as initially somewhat egotistical, however it was implied that he changed when visiting the mountains...How?<BR>Additionally, Eva's best friend turned gureilla fighter captivated me - what happened to him and how did he respond to the union between Rolf and Eva?<br />I adored the complexity and subtle plot, and its commentary on love, yet also found myself mildly disappointed with the second marriage of Eva's Turk friend and the manner in which Eva's life was so marvellously drawn out and explored, yet her love between Rolf was somewhat hurried. It seemed to reduce the sprawling luxury of the work.<br />However, this was a hugely interesting and entertaining read, and certainly one I enjoyed more than 'Daughter of Fortune'.<BR>It had the same epic grand narrative voice and a somewhat intricate path, but was both easy to read and likeable.<br />I plan to delve into more of Isobel Allende's outstanding works; revel in their complexity and language, and would recommend this book for reading, though perhaps not for purchasing.	2001-11-15

I am liking this author a great deal, and think she has some extremely important lessons to teach young adults. She incorporates a number of relevant themes - like love, the notion of beauty, acceptance and homosexuality into her work, but does so in an innovative and interesting manner which reeks of the stylisms of Magic Realism.<br />Her most famous work is undoubtedly the Weetzie Bat series, and I would be inclined to say that these are also her best, along with 'Violet and Claire'.<br />Whilst I find her all her works short and enjoyable, I do not think this particular work is best reflective of her talents, and whilst I would recommend it, 'Dangerous Angels' is probably a better introduction.<br />Whilst the author incorporates the same elements in this work, the characters feel a little undeveloped and the reasonings are not always clear. <br />I must admit, while I like Fransesca's books a great deal, I find her topic matter somewhat repetitive and some of the examples she sets a little unsuitable.<br />The characters are always young, smokers, having sex and the author continously emphasises how thin they are, in this novel clearly equating small size with beauty.<br />If anything, my main criticism is that the author never breaks away from these sterotypes, and it would be nice to see a little evolving on the part of this clearly slinster-cool writer.	2001-11-15

I would suggest that no one can, and thus I think you should consider picking one up.<br />This being my second Lia Block novel/s, I think it is a fine place to start, and has an innocence that my first read, 'Violet and Claire', was lacking. Nevertheless, it was more sophisticated and technically, more impressive.<br />Whilst the story line is far fetched, Lia Block makes the world is full of love and hope and all things slinsterlicious.<BR>She is cool and creative, and her books reflect a more youthful approach to magic realism. I will be reading this one again, and purchasing all those I am so far missing before too long. I suggest you do the same.

I must be the biggest fan in the world of 'Spilling Open', thus as you can imagine I was hugely excited for the release of the sequel. <br />And it is good, just the same style, in a purely wonderful way. It is still as untidy and rich and interesting and colourful as the first. If you didn't like that one, you won't like this. <br />Although you can tell she has developed new interests and talents, new artistic styles, yet it is just like the first, and equally lovable. I do, however, find 'Spilling Open' a little more healing, Sabrina is much more vulnerable and open, much more 'dishelved', yet 'Brave on Rocks' is more akin to a travel journal, and there is a slight distance between composer and audience that wasn't present in the first.<br />It is truly very magical, and very worthwhile. Its a real shame it is not available in Australia and other countries out of North America (as far as I know.) If first venturing into Sabrina's work, I strongly suggest you purchase the first one first, though I am not in any way, shape or form discouraging the purchase of 'Brave on the Rocks'. It is as lovely as anything she could produce, which is pretty lovely.<br />I truly hope there is more where that came from, she has altered my notion of beauty in art.	2001-08-28

I have never suffered huge bouts depression, so I may be a little unfair when saying that the author of this novel presents the apparantly everyday occurance in a very tedious manner.<br />This book has merit, and at times it immensly striking and hugely saddening, but really, the self absorbed nature of the writer bored me almost to the point where I put the book down in disgust, only to pick it up again, simply because leaving a book unfinished leaves me with my own feelings of incompletion. <br />I am not a prude, but depression does not justify holding a party for the loss of your virginity, or asking people not to pick on you, 'because you've just had a miscarriage'. A miscarriage from a pregnancy you neither knew about, and lets face it, would be unlikely to follow through with, and child you could not possibly care for.<br />Depression, or being the first woman on Prozac, does not justify writing a repetitive self indulgent tedious book about the hardships of depression (which apparantly so many experience for themselves) nor does it give you the right to contridict the entire book's apparant message and claim that any 'ole depressive shouldn't be given prozac, a drug supposedly reserved for the truly depressed. The others should grin and bear it, the very thing you whinged about having to do it for appoximately 200 pages too much.	2001-03-26

Occasionally, the thrill of expressive poetic literature gets old, and I simply long to pick up the most illogical book, just because. <br />And so, I was recommended this piece by the King of Illogical book fans, and so embarked on my first journey into the world of Ben Elton, which shall more than likely be followed by many more such journeys.<br />I am grateful for my friend, however if there is one book which has a statement, it is this seemingly funny novel. It's message; money doesn't buy everything, particularly the world, and the environment is distingrating at an alarming rate. Also, that using camels to save the world is no simple task.<br />It is not perfect, spans on way along the same line and ends in a bad way, yet it is well worth reading because it balances the important and the absurd, the riduculously humourous.	2001-02-21

I love Ondaatje's work, but there is none better than 'In the skin of a lion', there is no book more deserving of any award, including this one. <br />I have began and put down this book so frequently it is already dog-eared from my constant indecision. I think I feared that perhaps I would be disapppointed. <br />I adore both'In the Skin of a Lion' and 'Anil's Ghost' (to an extent) and I thought the film was amazingly beautiful. I must admit, I was slightly disappointed, but certainly, I could never regret finally reading the piece. There is a beauty captured many books, and no author captures the beauty of words and creates a more stunning and remembered image than Ondaatje.<br />I hate history books. Certainly, I see the importance of recording history, but I am far from a budding historian. This book has a substantial portion devoted to the events surrounding the second world war. I also hate sand and probably would despise deserts should I one day find the need to venture into one. This book has a substantial portion devoted to the desert. So we began on bad terms. <br />But there is more to this novel than sand and history; there is striking romanticism on several levels, wonderfully crafted descriptions and stunningly vivid characters. There is immense heartbreak and a fine weave of several sub stories. It is deep rich and vivid and worth reading. Particularly if you like sand, history and explosives. (Thankfully he hit a note with me there.)<br />'In the Skin of a lion' seems that tiny bit better, but I would have no hestitations in reccommending either, or any, of Ondaatje's work.	2001-02-04

If we are discussing the novel's ability to entertain, the first 200 or so pages leave something to be desired. I found that portion of the book to be dry, lacking and highly dull. Had it not been a compulsory school text, I would have had no hestations in putting it down and picking a Henry Miller novel. Needless to say, if you are reading 'North and South' purely for the purpose of enjoyment, you will need patience to see you past the book's inital tedious stage.<br />This however, does not do justice to the second half, which remarkably captures the attention of the reader. The heroine of the piece suffers setback after setback, and develops into an admirable, becoming and interesting character, not to mention Mr Thornton, who seems to develop some personality over the span of the piece. The class relations, the plight of women and the longing for independence and individuality felt by the characters becomes entertaining where it first provided endless boredom. Even more interesting is the love hate relationship between Miss Hale and Mr Thornton. Due to the fact the piece was not entirely completed, the ending is lacking a certain solidardity and denies the novel the zest it requires to 'bring it home'.<br />Despite the fact it came to grow on me, the beginning and the ending have lowered my opinion of the novel immensly, and it does become slightly repetitive. The romantic basis of the novel reminds me slightly of Austen's classic 'Pride and Prejudice'; the opening opposition of the lovers, the favours etc. This piece would have to contain more substance, though is by no means a better novel, despite the fact it explores such themes as classes and poverty, which Austen's piece rarely (if ever) mentions.<br />Regardless, eventually interesting enough, though certainly not among my favourites, and definitely not one I would have considered reading had it not be compulsory.	2001-01-21

I spend a lot more time reading about how I should go about achieving my dreams, rather than actually achieving them. I have read a disgusting amount of self-help books in the area of motivation and realising and making dreams come true. And here I am, in the process, but perhaps taking more time to make them come true than is really necessary.<br />This is the be all and end all of motivation books. The research that has gone into this piece, the endless and inpsiring quotes, the humour of the authors and the fabulous and down-to-earth method in which the book is written make it the finest of thousands of books on the same topic. Perhaps there is nothing really new in this book that you won't find elsewhere, but the authors work to make the readers realise their power, and the possiblity of their dreams.<br />Granted, I am not one to carry out time consuming exercises in discovering my true passion, which this book contains a few of. I personally have never had the patience for them (perhaps the very reason my dreams are not yet a reality) but I believe they are important, and the authors present them in a way that simplifies the process of motivation. <br />I found this book to be astonishingly good, wonderfully presented and researched, simple, and inspiring, much like 'You can't afford the luxury of a negative thought', another of their impassioned and humourous pieces. I feel like going out there and doing it right now; working to make my dreams come true, and after reading Do It!, I know it is not as hard as I have been led to believe. I cannot recommend this book enough.	2001-01-13

Reading any book for the sake of school can be a tedious and somewhat irrating task, however reading 'Brave New World' has made me change my tune. For the first time since 'To Kill a Mockingbird', I feel that I have read something with some merit, some worth, and a very obvious and startling lesson to teach.<br />Whilst some believe that 'Brave New World' argues against the nightmarish anti-utopia ( or utopia depending on your perspective) presented in the book, I would infact argue that Huxley's intention was to hint at the benefits of a society positioned somewhere into between the blissfully ignorant stable environment of the Brave New World and complete individualism and creativity. After all, there are very obvious benefits in the new society; a lack of disease, an abudence of blissfully ignorant happiness, and more important a lack of suffering. Do we need suffering to achieve contentment? The book presents the idea that perhaps we do, though it gives no answers for any of the many questions it raises to the reader.<br />The environment presented by the author is quite the paradox. You either face annihilation should you choose to ignore the strict codes of conformity, however the other option could be worse, a world without worth, emotions, a world which falls at the knees to science, though ironically sees the danger in science. The island, lying somewhere between the spectrum sounds brillant.<br />The book has fault, but is intensly scary and thought-provoking.	2001-01-02

This novel is at times remarkably heartbreaking and amazingly entertaining. Along with 'Catch 22', this is undoubtedly one of the most humourous pieces I am have read, and certainly one of 2000's finest reads for me.<br />I can see how some would argue that Eggers loses some of the genius in his own attempts to be funny, and the contrived nature of the piece, but I believe it's humourous value far outways the self absorbed nature of the writer. Contrived or not, it's merit as a witty novel by a wonderfully talented upcoming writer can not be argued.<br />Of course, he is self absorbed, to the point our sympathy wavers, but I imagine losing two parents and being left to care for your younger brother, all in the space of five short weeks calls for a bit of excessive sympathy and wallowing. <br />On the whole, 'A heartbreaking work of staggering genius' is often heartbreaking and staggering, but at all times hilarious. Well worth the little self indulgences of the talented author.	2000-12-23

I have read both 'Satanic Verses' and 'Midnight's Children in the past, adoring and recommending both to a host of friends and relatives. Rushdie has a way with words, and capturing the attention of the reader with his blend of magic realism and poetry. <br />So it was with this high opinion that I began one of his latest and less contriversal novels, and my soaring opinion of the man and his beautiful books only began to rise once I had completed this novel. There is no greater modern writer than Rushdie, perhaps with the exception of the magic realism master Marquez. It is evident in Rushdie's books that he feeds off Marquez, and he undoubtedly does so with his own fine balance of wit, humility and intellect, and this book is the finest example of Rushdie's continuing brillance against adversity and scrunity.<br />Rushdie indeed deserved the award for 'Booker of Bookers', however I wonder whether a better choice would have been the 'Moor's Last Sigh', which matches, if not overtakes 'Midnight's Children' in terms of enjoyment and brillance.<br />Wonderful, full and rich by an author who continues to astonish me and so many others.	2000-12-18

Like many of Oprah's novels, which is not discrediting her taste or the taste of so many who throughly enjoy them, I find her choices are frequently lacking a beauty I guess I require in a novel. They seem very surface, and whilst I would be lying should I say that I was not initally captivated by the novel, by it's conclusion I felt that it was becoming more the same. It started fabulously, and the characters are so brilliantly developed, but I felt a undeniable rush of tedium toward the end, as though the author had no other ideas but to pass a girl on from one hardship to another, and another and another, with miraculously, a positive conclusion, much like 'Where the Heart is', another of Oprah's fine selections. To me, the book seemed to follow a very set pattern, girl faces millions of difficulties making her a stronger harder person, only to find something in the end. I do think however, this book is ultimately a very interesting read, not revolutionary, but interesting enough to read. Perhaps not to reread. The characters were amusing and interesting, as well as developed, and the writing in many places was nicely done.	2000-12-17

The lessons given by the author's mentor, the slowly dying and former favourite unviersity professor Morrie are both relevant to modern life, as well as inspiring and heartwarming. I believe the world would be a kinder more loving place if we were required to read this beautiful novel, for even the most disbelieving and cynical of individuals will come to find themselves slowly taken in by Morrie's captivating messages.

This novel lacked a quality which makes Ondaatje's 'In the Skin of a Lion' one of my favourite novels, and although I cannot place it, the book seem to interest me less than his former pieces.<br />Although this can be said, I find myself unable to give Ondaatje less than four stars, because I am not looking at the novel objectively, but comparing it to his past works, which is hardly fair on any author. There is always going to be a novel which is more acclaimed, more enjoyed, and to demerit the others would be somewhat unfair.<br />Anil's Ghost, as a novel, contains flashs of brillance, moments when I became swept away in the sheer poetic nature of the moment. This is perhaps the author's aim, thus this novel is a success. At points however, I found it equally dry, and only became really engrossed after some patient reading. I believe that this is often a style the author employs, beginning his books slowly and lifting them to a crescendo toward the close. <br />I think the novel became less about the life of Sailor and the finds, but more about injustice and the lifes of the characters. <br />Regardless of some faults, I would recommend this novel if you have sufficent time, but I would also reccommend his brillant 'In the Skin of a Lion'.	2000-10-23

I find that anything Indian has this bizarre ability to capture and hold my attention, simply because almost every Indian author I have ever read has this exotic way of writing which reminds me of freshly baked Naan bread and the smell of spices. This author in particular, does not disappoint with her fluent, poetic novel about the bond of relatives and the losses of life. I believe this novel is slightly better than her acclaimed and more mystical'Mistress of Spice', though both are well worth the read, and give an insight into Indian life without the length of 'A Suitable Husband' or the contriversy of Salman Rushdie.

What else can be said?  I am disgusted that in the name of advancement, a single neighbouring country can wipe out centuries of culture; attempt assimilate an entire country to  fit the mold of another. Whats more, it was a country which practiced non  violence and compassion, that had a definite cultural and religious  indentity, far from in need of reform.<br />I think books like this should be  compulsory reading in schools. To often we dismiss our Western ways as the  norm, and come to believe that the rest of the world basks in the same  luxuries as we. Who could ever believe that in a modern Western world,  which prides itself on it's liberal nature, we can turn our head to our  Eastern neighbour, to their plight, to the years of jail so many suffer,  for absolutely no reason. This book is not even available in Australia.     I laughed at one former viewer's insightful comment, 'the only thing he  didn't do well is write it. Compared to Steinbeck.' What an absurd comment.  He is a simple Tibetan monk telling the tale of his fight against  oppression, not writing a novel for you to marvel over his exceptional  literary skills. You obviously missed the point, its shouldn't be how he  wrote it, but what he wrote.	2000-04-28

US	50657718	R1IS1IL425VYNK	0140119906	702863006	Love in the Time of Cholera (Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century)	Books	5	10	12	N	N	Marquez is a wizard of the written word!	You cannot claim to be well read unless you have experienced at least one of Gabriel's work, I personally have read almost them all, and his novels are the best of it's kind.  He is the inspiration for many great authors,  and I feel that if I were to become a writer, it would be his books I  modelled all that I wrote upon. His work undoubtedly needs patience, and  that is why I plan to read them all again in my old age, when time is not  an issue. Only then will I be doing justice to him and his passionate  novels, which is of a calibre of nothing I have encountered.<br />'Love in the  Times of Chloera' is not my favourite, and I feel nothing matches the power  and strong narrative style of 'One Hundred Years of Solitude', yet I can  see why this is probably equally associated with the Garbriel as the  forementioned. I enjoyed it almost as much.<br />His writing has what I value  most in a novel, busyiness, irony and wit, which is masterfully combined  with sadness and solitude, and I long to have that same ability to fashion  such gifted phrases as he. 'Love in the Times of Chlorea', made me realise  just how strong the forces of true love are, after 52 years, it can still  exist.<br />I will treasure this book and all that he has written, for he is  really a genius.	2000-03-16
US	50657718	R2YW6E9BX3CO88	0446602280	638210143	No One Here Gets Out Alive	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Any book on Jim Morrison is instantly interesting..	except if it is by John Densmore.<br />I found this book to, as almost any Jim Morrison biography is, to be interesting and well written, passionate and vivid. Perhaps I did not enjoy it quite as much as Break on Through; the life and death of Jim Morrison, however the two were so simliar at  times, it felt like entire pages were extracted out of this book to fit the  latter. Somehow in the transition though, Break on Through became the more  entertaining.<br />I found this book, however interesting, to be remotely  biased. I also agree that Jim Morrison would be less than impressed that a  mailboy, a man whom he once gave Rolling Stones tickets, would become rich  as a result of his life. Although, I doubt Jim would be impressed that any  book about him mentioned his career as a singer. It seemed to be poet or  nothing.<br />Ultimately a very interesting acount of a poetic genius, who has  long lived his 27 years. The literary quotations are impressive and  researched, but the book strikes me as somewhat shallow at times.	2000-03-04
US	50657718	R5G43ZVJGE8YB	0140132708	903668876	Midnight's Children	Books	5	9	16	N	N	Another Rushdie masterpiece.	I am biased, and there is no two ways about that. I believe Rushdie is the greatest mordern writer in history, hence if he wrote the eqivalent of 'Amsterdam' I would probably rave about. If I had to name a favourite of  Rushdie's written work, I would always name 'Satanic Verses' as my  perfered, due to it's sheer brilliance and busyness, however it is closely  followed by 'Midnight's Children.' I read it a couple of months ago, and my  message remained unposted, hence my recollection is a bit blurry, however I  remember raving in that review immediately after reading it. I think that  Salman Rushdie, along with the 1997 Booker prize winner and the likes of  Rohiston Mistry and the novel 'Flower Boy' have created a standard of  writing that the rest of the world should to aim to match. I absolutely  love Indian literature, much of it being as many have mentioned, being in  the little known, but highly interesting genre of magic realism, along with  the fabulous Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Love in Times of Chlorea. I plead  for people to give this style of writing, and 'Midnight's Children' a  chance. The later is an interesting, consistant and busy novel, which I  enjoyed from every aspect, and will remember for much of my reading life.	2000-02-28
US	50657718	R1I7GJAB91ADQO	0140481389	156931332	The Crucible (Penguin Plays)	Books	4	3	8	N	N	Pretty good.	Like so many others, I can never enjoy a novel or play if it is being forced down my throat, I am set to hate anything the school offers me. (Except for To Kill a Mockingbird, that was a brilliant choice on the Board  of Education's part.) I found that however negative my attitude to school  books was, it disappeared throughout this play. It was not close to the  best play ever written (especially when it has Shakespeare as it's  competition) but it was nevertheless, ultimately very entertaining in  watching war movie kind of way. You cannot comprehend what is occuring, yet  you cannot tear your eyes away from the truth. (Or part of the truth.) The  characters annoy every facet of my mind, with the selfish Abagail, the  (what must be pedophilic) John Protor and of course the Preist Parris. How  could I forget. I imagine this would be a very powerful play to see,  although it is not great, it is still relatively entertaining and worth the  read. I suggest you avoid the tape, because whilst I will agree Titaba's  voice is highly entertaining, the tape is a very boring piece of listening.	2000-02-28

I was prepared to love this book, hence I was left more than sligtly disappointed when I remotely enjoyed most of it.  I didn't find it stunning, beautiful or highly inspirational, and at times found it a little  hard, a little too crude and confronting. In some texts, this works, but  for some reason 'Disgrace' did not shock me into action or thought, but  more disgust and indifference. The theme no doubt a very interesting one,  the story a heart wrenching and ironic display of division in South Africa,  but I found myself ultimately disliking David Lurie, and as the book  proceeded, ccaring little about his selfish views or problems. His  problems, ultimately were brought upon himself, and I resented the fact  that he refused to take responsibility or care until the ending. I feel  that this was decent, perhaps even quite good, but again, I would doubt  that it is Booker standard, a second year in a row.  A short, and  worthwhile read, but nothing amazily special or spectatular.	2000-02-11

This book is not really available in Australia, and too bad for all the Australians missing out. This is the most astonishing, most beautiful book I have ever come across. Having being a journal writer for as long as I can  remember, this book was a wake up call on how much I have to learn on the  art of creative journal writing. This book is the epitome of creative, it  literally spills creativity and reflection from the first page to the last.  It is colourful, astonishingly thoughtful and indescribly beautiful. I can  see why Sark and Sabrina have befriended each other, it is easy to see that  their souls undoubtably dance to the same tune. They are both beautiful and  this shines in their glorious books.  My only complaint with this book, is  that we are often only given sectors of her life, and I am frequently left  wondering who she is talking about and what the pictures and the  significance of small things she puts in there.	2000-02-11
US	50657718	R3DRUVGGMJHHLH	0060915544	842706595	The Bean Trees	Books	4	9	14	N	N	I am not quite sure what to think....	After reading some fairly difficult novels of late, something light was exactly what I needed. And light was what I got with this book. This is the sort of novel that takes no more than two hours to read, and once you  finish it, it will probably be cast totally from your reading memory. It is  nothing highly special or new, yet it is a fun and attention capturing  read, but hardly material you would think to return to. It reminded me of  Oprah's now famous 'Where the Heart is', although I prefered this one  significantly more. It, like Where the Heart, is the story of a Southern  American women, highly uneducated, somewhat lumped with a child, travelling  and eventually finding a place to call home. An educated man, driven from  society takes both character's interest, with differed results of the  success of the character's wooing abilities.  I felt that where this novel  was a success was the writing ability of the author, and the compassion  that seeped into what could have been, a totally simplistic and stale  story. Yet, Kingsolver, a writer with immense potential, made this story  hugely heart warming, the characters naive, but innocently so, as opposed  to annoyingly stupid. Perhaps a better book for young adult readers, but  still interesting for the majority.	2000-02-08

Ultimately, we never enjoy novels or plays we are forced to read as much as free choice reading selections. However, I was pleasantly surprised with my school's decision to do a reading of 'The Crucible.' With the exception  of 'To Kill a Mockingbird', it would have to be one of their better  choices. 'The Crucible' is cruel and frustrating, but is certainly a book  that teaches us much about this period of time in this area of America. It  has to contain some of the most hypocritical characters in a written piece  I have ever encountered. My frustration and dislike for Abigail, mounted  steadily to a growing hate at the close of the play. I feel that whilst  this was not close to a perfect play, and occasionally frustrated me with  it's consistancy, it is both informative and relatively entertaining. A  somewhat short read, which I am sure would be marvellous to see as a play.	2000-02-04
US	50657718	R11QAQD68PI5TA	0140132708	903668876	Midnight's Children	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Wow! I am rendered speechless.	I love Salman Rushdie, so any review I may write will be biased simply because I value everything Salman has to say. I love his bitting sense of humour particularly when looking at despondent issues such as poverty, I  love his vivid descriptions and his almost obsessive love of small details,  when describing even the most inconsquencal of his characters. But what I  love most is the gross ironies he presents in his novels. Midnight's  Children is no exception to Rushdie's favourite fable method, and if full  of hilariously detailed paradoxes. The idea of swapped births, rich to poor  and poor to rich, but still ending up in the manner which they were born,  to me, is ingenius. While I did not enjoy this one quite as much as Satanic  Verses, I believe Salman's writing is something you begin to appericate  after you give his novel's considerable thought. They are somewhat hard to  digest at the beginning, but once  thought over; the links, the hidden  messages and abundent symbols make it all much clearer why Salman has  earned the praise he recieves. A busy, beautiful and saddening novel, andd  one which I will remember forever.	2000-02-03

Whilst I did not enjoy this book like I enjoyed Catch 22, or such solid hearty novel, I felt that to offer it less than five stars would be a mistake, and the undervaluing of an important and influential book. I may  have loved Catch 22, but I won't necessarily remember it forever, where as  The Alchemist raised many issues I believe I will ponder for the remainder  of my life. It is a fairly swift read, read by me at odd moments during a  single day and finished at the close of the night, and could be described  more as pyshcology before novel, however the philosophies of the book are  presented brilliantly. Behind the magical mysterious story of a travel  loving shepard seeking his true destiny and meeting many people who will  shape the rest of his life along the way. I could never 'love' this novel,  but it is most certainly an important one, that I will not forget, and  although I do not agree with all issues raised, it certainly prompted a  fury of thought regarding my life path, and whether I will be doing what I  want to in six years, and in sixty. This is single objective of Cohelo's  simple book. Hence, for me this book was an utter success. I felt that the  length of the book was sufficent; any longer it may have seemed like  preaching. All in all, Inspiring philosophies hidden behind a simple story.	2000-01-13

This book is far from the greatest I have ever read, and I am left wondering how Rebecca Wells has been named 'Author of the Year', but it is intensly heart wrenching, and contains a divine mix of both humour and  sadness. I cried frequently, as well as found myself laughing at the  bizarre antics of the character's friendship, and crying at the sad deaths  of interesting characters. I expected a lot less of this novel, for it is  not the usual style of book I enjoy, but was plesantly surprised that it  was well written and almost magical in it's style. I did however find the  characters self absorbant and selfish, and later on in the novel found  myself less interested in their actions.  This novel, like all, has faults,  but is a quick and inspiring look into friendship, Southern ways, and the  relationship between daughters and their mothers.	2000-01-04
US	50657718	R1Q6NEC2KXTL22	0688119158	873795671	Break on Through: The Life and Death of Jim Morrison	Books	5	12	16	N	N	Brilliant, of course I am biased on this one!	If there was but one biography I was able to read for the rest of my existance, I would consider this one being the one I select. I have loved The Doors and Jim Morrison for as long as I can recall, and found the  practise of alternative religions and shamanism interesting long before I  learnt that Jim was more than just dabbling in Shamanism, but believed he  was posessed by a medicine man. Hence, this novel, with all its poetry  clippings, information regarding shamanism, a somewhat more accurate  portrayal of Jim, and the writer's zealous attitude regarding Jim ( it was  clear the writer found Jim Morrison to be the most marvellous person to  have existed), combined with the simple, factual and well written book  presentation, this is one of the most passionate and beautiful biographies  I have ever encountered. It is clearly meticiously researched (as is seen  by the poetry excerpts scattered throughout) and obviously of huge interest  to the author.  Although I can't imagine it being of great interest to  those not particularly interested in Jim Morrison, as there is much less  emphasism on The Doors, and basically solely revolves around the chrismatic  lead singer. I feel, however that it will certainly provide entertainment  for most willing to see it through to the close, simply because Jim  Morrison was an enigmatic and highly interesting personality.  This novel  centres much around the idea that Jim was a poet, and not a rock star, and  while this can prove repitious, the case is presented in a way that allows  us to excuse much of Jim's outward behaviour.   A brilliant overview of a  brilliant genius.	1999-12-28

I hate the way he ruins a decent and heart felt book, by a second rate follow up, a marketing scheme to milk more money from poor readers who would be better off not reading his books, or getting  them from the Library.  I loved the Power Of One, even though I read it and  this so long ago, I still remember the satisfaction of finishing it, and  how warming and rich the story was. But no, Bryce couldn't leave it at  that, and had to write a follow up, which was only a fifth as good as the  first, thereby leaving me disliking The Power of One a little. Did this  book strike anyone as a little indecent?  I have no problems with sex in  art, books, movies etc, but for some reason, when Bryce decribes it, it  feels a little dirty. Perhaps this was the one reason I did not enjoy this  book. I am sorry to burst any Bryce bubbles here, but the man is far from a  genius, and is neither remotely interesting or slightly amusing. Read the  Power of One, and stop there.	1999-12-19

I have not read any of her other novels, hence I cannot comment on whether this is a depreciation on her writing talents, however I found it most enjoyable and simple to  read and finish. I did however feel that Allende started so well and  explored so many characters and events, yet left many questions and issues  uncharactered and questionable. It didn't capture my attention like several  other novels I have recently read, and inially, after completing it, I was  extremely distressed that such built up novel could be finished as swiftly  and predictably as it did. In fact, the ending was known to all who read it  carefully, due to the passing comments Allende throws in to conquer the  ambigity of the tale's ending. At the time, these too annoyed me, however I  now understand Allende reasoning. I found, like many others, the characters  of Tao and Mama Frisco to be the most interesting of the novel, and the  tedious actions of the childish Eliza and her selfish aristocratic family  the more annoying, however central they were to the book.  The plot, ended  a bit adrift, and I found myself let unsatisfied, wondering how exactly Tao  and Eliza's unity progressed to form a loving relationship. I felt the  unfolding of their love and how they eventually admitted to wanting to be  together should have been probed more deeply, considering that her rebirth  and the transition of love between Joaquin and Tao was such a major part in  the story and her eventual existance. I also wondered what came of Miss  Rose and her new passion for life. Was she to find the daughter who  betrayed her, and live once more, or was she to become more introved and  lost due to her inability to find Eliza. Did Eliza ever find out who her  real father was, what was her reaction, and how did it change her view on  life, and her upbringing, and those that kept the secret from her? One  thing I really felt should have been made clear was whether Joaquin became  aware of Eliza's extremes, whether he found out about her adventure to a  new land to find him. Was he ignoring her travels and desires for him, or  did he never know? If he did, would things have been different between Tao  and Eliza? Although this book is interesting enough, such questions and  unanswered issues plague me, and make it impossible to grant it a full five  stars. It is actually bordering on three.	1999-12-13

From the very moment I purchased this novel in a small run down spirtual shop in Sydney Australia, I knew that my love affair with Sark's highly inspirational and interesting novels was about to begin. Since that point  in time appoximately two or three years ago, I have read all her novels,  and have fell in love with each one. I believe that whilst all are  beautiful and intriging, this one is the best. The little decorating points  such as the drawing, the colours and the added sayings help to complete  what will aways be my favourite book. I would highly recommend this book  for the simple fact that Sark, unlike many self help writers, places her  self amongst her readers. She does not claim to have all the secrets to a  successful life, but like us, is in the process of learning to be happy,  and teaches that she too has faults and negativity, but that makes her  human. I could think of nothing more enjoyable than an evening curled up to  this book, or any Sark novel infact.	1999-12-05

I found this book a delight to read, and foundd myself finishing it in one sitting, and glad that I did not purchash it, but borrowed it from a local library. I can understand why it has recieved many adult fiction awards,  because it really suits that particular age group with its simple style of  writing and happy-go-lucky ending. I can hardly say that it was an overly  emotional or difficult read, however the excellent storyline was enough to  entice me. I found this novel interesting enough, without tedium and simple  to read, hence well worth the effort. Perhaps it is not the best book to  purchash however, and it more suitably borrowed.	1999-12-02
