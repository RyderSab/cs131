Stranger still are second-person segments in which the reader is admonished (\\"you should always..\\").   <br /> <br />Those quirks aside, this is a pretty fun read.	2005-03-03

I'm very interested in maritime lore and sea stories, but this was rough going.  The narrator's friend Luke is made to spew lots of didactic talk about things the author is too lazy to show us.  His emotions are conveyed through the constant use of italics, and he begins every sentence with the author's first name. <br /> <br />Potentially very interesting, and apparently enjoyable to some, I thought this was a mess.	2005-02-07

Several insightful reviews here have expanded on the weaknesses of this book and the disappointment that followed its hype-fueled release.  They're all right.  There's a good, short book screaming to get out of this bloated, rambling, unfocused mess, and Conlon was done a disservice by not having received some criticism (and editing) prior to its publication.  <br />I believe Conlon might write a good book one day, but this meandering quagmire between covers isn't it.	2004-07-28

It benefits from the input of many who were there, particularly Tony Asher, and is highly recommended.<br />When discussing Brian's drug use the author says that many people believe that drugs are responsible for Brian's &quot;difficulties,&quot; an assertion he claims is backed up &quot;by a mountain of scientific data.&quot;  Brian is indeed known to have used drugs, but the author has no medical credentials and should avoid these kinds of conclusions.<br />Great when it's talking about music, this book will be enjoyed by all who love the music of Brian and the Beach Boys.	2004-05-12

Nice insights into family dynamics and generational friction, the search for &quot;authenticity&quot; (black panthers, bomb-making) by white, middle class kids, and a glimpse of what life was like among the radical fringe. For a West Coast take on the same period, look at Peter Coyote's &quot;Sleeping Where I fall.&quot; Both explore the confluence of the personal and the political in a volatile era.	2004-04-21

The detail in which Mease's life is recounted makes it hard not to sympathize with him and to understand his crimes, a feeling which the author appears to share. <BR> <BR>The second half of the story explores Darrell's trial, imprisonment, conversion story and ultimate pardon from execution.  In that part, Darrell is portrayed less sympathetically, and there is even a suggestion that he is undeserving of his eventual pardon from death row. <BR>This apparent shift in viewpoint is appropriate to this complex tale, though, where Darrell comes to represent something different to everyone who comes into contact with him: death penalty opponents, Ozark locals, the victims' family, law enforcement, even Pope John Paul II!<br />It's a fine book, ultimately, and explores a lot of the issues (religion and government, death penalty, small town policing, veterans' problems, rural poverty, drugs) raised by this unusual case. Well written, compelling and highly recommended.	2004-04-15

There's some slaughter, of course, which Kenji passively observes (maybe he's hypnotized by a Visa card. It's complicated.). Anyway, the serial killer is philosophical (uh-oh) and his monologues (and Kenji's reactions) provide some astonishing psychological and sociological critiques: maybe there is no &quot;real&quot; self! Oh yeah, and a lot of people are lonely and others care only about material goods! <BR>This is a cut above (pun intended) lots of slasher trash, but it's not nearly as profound as it thinks it is. Recommended for moody, reflective teens and young adults entranced by the combination of gore and aimless disaffection.	2004-04-07

I wasn't sure I could take another Sammy Davis, Jr. biography so soon after Will Haygood's recent (and excellent) biography, but the brisk pacing and clear writing drew me in.  Fishgall sticks to the major events in Sammy's life and doesn't go overboard with the historical background, but a clear picture of the man and his time emerges.  I felt an inordinate amount of attention was paid to Sammy's later years and television appearances, but I appreciated learning more about his children and his third marriage. If you can only read one, read &quot;In Black and White.&quot; If you're still interested, read Sammy's own books, and include this strong, fair biography.	2004-04-01

The brisk narrative follows the career of Richard Marcus from his adolescent wanderings, through his tutelage by an older casino cheat, and into his formation and leadership of an expert roulette crew.

Larson's a fine writer.  I paused several places in this book to relish a particularly graceful turn of phrase.  I am sympathetic to the disappointment expressed by some reviewers, though. The dark thread about murderer Holmes woven through the triumphant story of the fair works beautifully as an undercurrent to the tale of optimism and progress near the century's turn, but it sets up an expectation of a true crime/detective story and doesn't really deliver one. Looking back, many readers may have preferred that these stories be told in two different books. Still, one of the best nonfiction books of the season.	2004-03-19

If you can survive the first 30 pages or so, you may come to enjoy this somewhat overstuffed look back by Eszterhas. His warts-and-all honesty grows on the reader, and as the book picks up steam his puffed-chest braggadocio gives way to rueful reminiscences of his coming of age as a child of immigrants. <BR>The bulk of the book is war stories about wacky stars, backstabbing executives, greedy studios, wild parties, cocaine, etc. <BR>Still, against my better judgement, I came to like Eszterhas and to admire his raw ambition. What surprised me was that he's not really much of a writer.  He likens himself to Faulkner and Fitzgerald, but writes like someone who dreams up concepts for blockbusters. I guess that's what screenwriters do. Still, it's hard to read about his difficult life without empathy, and there are stories, like the story of the first time his father tasted pizza, that are beautiful and moving.	2004-03-05

What drives me crazy is the terminally parochial smugness of small town residents who have lived here longer than you have.  The author (who has assumed the mantle of \\"local\\" somewhat late in the game)continually smirks about \\"summer people\\" and the loutish, insensitive tourists she imagines to be shocked by Cape Cod's gay residents.  When her own mawkish sentimentality is revealed during her sensitive musings in a thrift store, her snobbishness morphs into hypocrisy. <br />The author's tone isn't quite enough to ruin the book, but it's a distraction.  If the reader can tune it out, and overlook her self-righteousness about single motherhood, it is possible to enjoy the sharp characterization and often good writing contained in this book.	2004-01-16

I came to this with an interest in poker, but the book doesn't dwell on the intricacies of that game. Rather it allows the reader to spend a couple of hours in the company of a funny, colorful, slyly intelligent Texan with a lot of great stories and a hilarious way with words. Follow Slim through pool halls, golf courses and grand casinos as he makes his fortune betting (not really gambling if you know you're gonna win!). Slim is a natural storyteller and makes this book hard to put down.  My only quibble is that the author portrays himself as a loving family man underneath it all, while looking down his nose at the Pablo Escobars and Larry Flynts he took money from.<BR>Still, a great book and a fun read.	2004-01-05

Those memories are vivid and fascinating but, alas, contribute to the widespread image of Frank as not a very nice person.<br />For those able to filter the author's perspective, though, and account for his obvious biases and self aggrandizement, this book is an intimate glimpse into the lives of the famous and powerful in 50s and 60s show business. It's ultimately gossip, of course, but I found it hard to put down and recommend it to anyone interested in Frank, the Rat Pack, the Kennedys and the 60s.	2003-12-12

Like a fleshed out magazine article, perhaps, it touches on a bit of history, a few sketches of famous teammates, and a recounting of the high spots of this charming hall of famer's career. A good choice for the younger fan with no memory of the game as it was in a simpler time.	2003-12-10

Modern day piracy is no joke, and the author is convincing in his argument that a major incident is not far from landing on the front pages. The line between pirates and terrorists is a fine one, and security on the high seas is almost nonexistant. I found the book's structure and writing to be adequate to its message, but not too much more.  Less seriously, I was amused by the author's references to exercise and his physical condition and wondered who he was trying to convince. The reader? A younger wife? Nevertheless, a serious book, and one with appeal to readers interested in crime, international affairs and all things maritime.	2003-12-03

I was put off a bit at first - the book's momentum was slowed by the author's habit of inserting a mini-biography whenever a character was introduced - but I grew to enjoy this fascinating book much more as it progressed.  Some may feel that the author goes too far in assuming the reader has never heard of Marcus Garvey, the Harlem Renaissance, the civil rights movement, etc., and may find the constant summaries of historical events unnecessary.  I did.  Still, the details of Sammy's growing up on the road, the hardships endured by negro vaudeville performers, the complete lack of formal education, the hand to mouth existence, the constant travel, form a powerful cumulative portrait of a man and his time.  <br />This book drew me in, fascinated me with its psychologically complex picture of Davis, and left me with a desire to reinvestigate the music and films he left behind.  <br />A top-notch biography.	2003-10-28

As these books usually do, this one walks the reader through the crime, the personalities involved, and the trial and sentencing. As the book progresses, the reader sees a wierder and more detailed portrait of the misfit lawyers and the violent convict at the heart of this case, and learns a bit about the breeding of vicious dogs.<BR>Some of the morally indignant reviews below note that the book does not focus primarily on the innocent victim of this awful dog mauling, and they're right. It does not.  For better or for worse, true crime books are primarily about crime and criminals.<BR>As these things go, this book is interesting and informative, and will satisfy true crime buffs and those interested in this notorious case	2003-10-08

The slangy informal prose makes Gorightly a disarming guide through this compendium of wacky Manson lore.  There's a little of that underground-UFO-... stance ('what the mainstream press won't tell you!') but the author doesn't take it too seriously so don't you either. There are no notes or sources to speak of, so it may not correspond to what many of us think as a \\"real\\" book, but it's somewhat entertaining if taken in the right spirit. The breathless tone at times reminds one of a young Geraldo Rivera - loony but strangely compelling.	2003-01-03

As in 'let's not allow PROOF to get in the way of a good story.' She doesn't. I believe the well-intentioned author could have saved herself some embarrassment by reviewing some of the Ripper books published over the years. Anyone can marshall this mess of evidence to convict their favorite suspect.  She's just the latest (and perhaps most arrogant).	2002-12-27

The other recent work on Zodiac devotes several hundred pages to a suspect which that author names as the Zodiac killer. This book mentions his name once, in a one sentence dismissal. It's getting to be like Jack the Ripper, where a new theory emerges every few years (Maybe this will be next on Patricia Cornwell's list).  I don't have a favorite suspect or theory to defend, but I enjoy an articulate examination of a compelling mystery.  This is one.	2002-12-20

If anything, the book is worse than that review indicates.  The tapes were either transcribed by a particularly backward sixth-grader or someone who simply didn't care.

Each seems to add a little to a complex story that no single perspective can completely render. If you find this band, the 60s, psychedelia and the San Francisco scene to be of interest, by all means read this entertaining book. McNally is particularly good in exploring psychedelia's emphasis on the \\"now,\\" and Garcia's embrace of spontaneous performance as a high art form (pun intended).<BR> Again, as other reviewers pointed out, this is not the only story. Read the other dead books, Peter Coyote's book (as someone here suggested), the Bill Graham biography, Charles Perry's \\"Haight-Ashbury,\\" the books about Janis Joplin, \\"Storming Heaven\\" the great book about LSD and its social impact, \\"Electric Kool Aid Acid Test,\\" and on and on. (One problem in reading these general works, though, is that you'll have to endure some of the same stories over and over, and you'll have authors explaining to you what LSD was, and who Bob Dylan is.) <BR> I find this period endlessly fascinating and overall it's being well served by some really terrific books - this one included.	2002-10-11

It's about power, money, gender issues, idealism and self-deception at least as much as it is about Zen. The central character has all the characteristics of a tragic hero and his rise and fall is detailed in a way that would make Theodore Dreiser proud.
