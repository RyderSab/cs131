And then, finally, it's undersized in that the ending falls flat, because the title character's redemption is telescoped from page one.  But, with all that, it's pretty much a good read because Gregory David Roberts knows, loves, and can write about Bombay specifically, and India in general, and takes us places in India's heart we'd never get to on our own.	2005-10-10

The good Pope v. the bad Secretary of State; the Pope's confidant - a good priest on the verge of loosing his faith; the conflicted journalist, in this case doing double-duty as the romantic interest (a knock-out, as usual;) and the well placed allies and adversaries of the above, doing battle for the heart and soul of a Church steeped in mystery and locked in crisis - \\"The Third Secret,\\" is no different.   <br /> <br />The book's opening chapter, a re-telling of the Blessed Virgin's appearances at Fatima is so poorly written (third grade level,) I almost gave the book a toss, but as a true fan of the genre I decided to persevere.  I'm glad I did, because Mr. Berry has constructed a page-turner.   <br /> <br />Though the characters are stock, Mr. Berry has filled them out enough beyond clich to make them interesting.  If they aren't three dimensional, they are at least 2  dimensional - good enough for a pot-boiler.  The villains aren't completely villainous; and the good guys suffer enough turmoil and doubt to ground them.  <br /> <br /> Mr. Berry is well steeped in the inner workings of the Vatican, and gives new twists to the life of the Curia, the politics of the Church's princes, and the mechanics of papal ascension. <br /> <br />The plot takes some interesting turns as it revolves around the unveiling of a hitherto missing portion of the third secret of Fatima, hence the title.  The secret has caused Pope's to tremble, and if revealed will shake the Church to its foundations.  Without giving anything away, suffice it to say the Virgin Lady anticipated today's culture wars, and decided to side with the ultra-left wing of Catholicism.  The message turns out to be even more laughable than the jokes that it has inspired through the years, and unfortunately for the novel, suspension of disbelief goes right out the window as soon as the secret is revealed.  A pity, because I thought Mr. Berry was on to something bigger than a wish-list of ultra-liberal fantasies. <br /> <br />\\"The Third Secret,\\" is a good beach, or airplane read - perfect for the summer - a cut above \\"Angels and Demons,\\" though most everything is; but, because of its dnouement, as unsuccessful as any other title in the genre.    <br />	2005-05-31

Arguably India's Golden Age, the near two-hundred years of the Mughal Empire from Babur to Aurangzeb was a time when the richest got richer, conquered and ruled SE Asia from Kabul to Konyakumari, built cities, forts, and fabulous tombs, lived fairly short lives, wept over trivialities, warred amongst themselves, blinded, maimed, and executed family members; and, after Aurangzeb, lost it all except in name. <br /> <br />\\"The Mughal Throne:  The Saga of India's Great Emperors,\\" is the first released third volume of a four part history of India, and though it is far from the definitive work on the Mughals it is a well written, and exciting saga - just what the title says it would be - a narrative that hits all the high points, and delves into just enough detail not to loose the casual historian or India-phile. <br /> <br />If you want to know India, especially Northern India, you must know the Mughals, and they're a family worth knowing.  (If you like the Medici's, you'll love the Mughals.) Their reign was short in the scheme of Indian history, but stamped the country for all time.   <br />	2005-05-06

The character is attractive, talented, troubled, romantic, decisive - all the things you want a hero to be; his friends, mentors, and lovers are competent and likable; the villains are as bad as you would want them to be; and the stories have that \\"ripped from the headlines,\\"  feel that propels most thrillers. <br /> <br />\\"Prince of Fire\\" follows the formula evident from Gabriel Allon's first outing - pulled out of the spiritual task of reconstructing Renaissance art to deal with another threat to Israel, Gabriel in conjunction with his mentor, Ari Shamron, get the job done while dealing with personal demons, and bureaucratic bumbling.   Gabriel, and his supporting cast, have all grown as characters (a plus for Mr. Silva,) but the formula has remained the same, and though \\"Prince of Fire\\" is as exciting as usual it's time for Gabriel Allon or Daniel Silva to move on.  I'm happy to say there seems to be an opening for just such an eventuality in this new book. <br /> <br />If you've enjoyed the stories thus far, \\"Prince of Fire\\" won't let you down, and like all good serials, it leaves you wanting more. <br /> <br />	2005-04-01

It does, however, serve as a compelling melodrama, and a look at a Barcelona that is both familiar and a city out of dream.<br /><br />The characters are a mix of the broadly drawn, and the somewhat more nuanced.  The primary players are the slightly callow but charming Daniel in his coming-of-age; his father, the kind-hearted and wise owner of an antiquarian bookstore; and his father's helper rescued from the gutter, hiding from the law, in love with women, and dispensing comic advice to all and sundry.  These three flow in and out of hair-raising, comic, and over-the-top situations with family, friends, lovers, would-be lovers, villains, and the flesh-and-blood specter who may well be \\"The Shadow of the Wind.\\"<br /><br />Carlos Ruiz Zafron, the author, is in love with books and what they mean to other book lovers.  He tells a good story, takes many interesting digressions - in fact, there probably isn't a digression he hasn't taken - and enchanted me throughout.<br /><br />It's always interesting when a book goes through a translation, especially when the book is well reviewed in the original, and mixed in the translation.  \\"The Shadow of the Wind,\\" may be a better book than we will ever know, and, as it is, I recommend it as a light but very atmospheric read.	2005-02-10

Afghanistan seems to be less a country than a battlefield. Armies have been marching through the Hindu Kush  from time immemorial, and it seems like anyone who was anyone has left footprints:  Darius the Great, Alexander the Great, Ghengis Khan, Tamerlane, Babur; and the countries led by less recognizable names -  the British, the Russians, the Russians and the British, the Russians again, and now the Americans.  Not to mention the almost constant internal strife between clans and warlords, most recently the Taliban and the Northern Alliance as represented by Osama bin Laden, and Ahmad Shah Massoud. <br /> <br />Steven Coll takes a relatively small piece of history, from the Russian invasion of 1979 to September 10, 2001, and tells an absolutely remarkable story of the high level skullduggery of the CIA, its Pakistani counterpart - the ISI, the Russian's KGB, and the Saudi intelligence agency.  This is a briskly paced story of individuals and nations lying down with dogs and waking up with the fleas of lies compounded by lies, crosses, double-crosses, extortions, and murders - individual and mass.   <br /> <br />\\"Ghost Wars...\\" is the scorecard you need to identify the players and the plays, and what's remarkable is that Mr. Coll, with a wealth of detail, keeps it all moving as an exciting read. <br /> <br />If you really want to know what led up to 9/11 with the info behind the headlines, this is the book for you. <br />	2005-02-10

Part one is a memoir in the guise of \\"Tap Dance Stories;\\" part two, \\"Theory and Practice,\\" is a master class for experienced tap dancers, but not to be skipped by the in, un, or less experienced, as Brenda continues the memoir even as she notates rhythms, and offers teaching tips.  <br /> <br />Full disclosure: I count myself as one of Brenda's many friends, and my wife has produced her work in Seattle over the course of the years. From that vantage point I've been witness to a few of the events in this book, and have also been a willing audience for many of the stories. Brenda is an inveterate story-teller whose ideas, interests, and sources range vastly. A conversation with her, especially if it's a group event, is often like a tropical storm, and when she said she was writing a book I wondered how she'd be able to master the elements to a table as rigid as the page. Now, Brenda may be an improviser, but that's not to say she isn't disciplined, and she found the discipline for the book without sacrificing the art of the story. The book is a good read. It's witty, filled with tap history, opinionated, and touching in its personal reminiscences - most notably of her mother, her mystical involvement with people and place, and her long association with Honi Coles.  <br /> <br />Brenda is an Artist, with a capital A. As a being she transcends her chosen forms. Her book will be purchased by dancers, but it's a book for artists, so if you are on the path, \\"Tapping the Source,\\" is a useful map.	2005-02-08

The romantic presents Alexander as a sensitive soul, in love with friend and foe alike - a benevolent sort of warlord.  The romantic view applies to both novelists and (unfortunately) some historians.  The historical school (when not of the romantic ilk) tends to present an Alexander less sensitive and much crueler than the myth allows.  Simple case in point:  who engineered Phillip's assasination?  The romantics don't know, or don't care; the historians make a case for Alexander's complicity.  Steven Pressfield comes out of the romantic pack, and his Alexander falls short of his best work, landing somewhere in the area of a tactical handbook for Alexander's military genius, and the usual warlord with a heart of gold clap-trap.  Too bad, but Mr. Pressfield's other books share the same problem, albeit with more vibrant battle scenes.  Considering the more compelling fiction on the market, and the interesting histories, I'd recommend a pass on this one.	2004-11-01

I picked it up based on the two pages of blurbs at the front of the book.  I expected crime fiction, and hoped for an intelligent read.  My expectations and hopes were met, but \\"Hard Revolution,\\" is much more than crime fiction.  Three-quarters of the way through I started thinking about awards.  \\"Hard Revolution,\\" should be a definite contender, if not winner of the Edgar, but that's to cement this effort in a category it transcends.  Seems to me \\"Hard Revolution,\\" should be up for a National Book Award, or Pulitzer. <br /> <br />I won't provide a plot summary as other reviewers have more than adequately covered that ground. <br /> <br />Mr. Pelecanos gives us a character study in which he proves he knows what makes people tick, a crime story that moves with true motivation, and a particularly troublesome piece of American history.  The only character problem I saw was the all-abiding goodness of Darius and Alethea, the protagonist's parents.  But even their goodness allowed for a certain edge that kept them believable.  It may be more my cynicism than the author's failing. <br /> <br />There may be four or five pages in this book - toward the end - that give us a little more detail of the destruction of the DC riots in 1968, but in defense of those pages Mr. Pelecanos does well in making the streets familiar enough that maybe we'd want to know what happened to the various businesses that were torched and looted. <br /> <br />I've learned \\"Hard Revolution,\\" is a prequel to a series of novels centered around DC and the life and times of Derek Strange.  I look forward to catching up! <br /> <br />Highly recommended to those who are interested in a good novel. <br />	2004-09-22

Also featured are American politicians and industrialists, the hierarchy of the Nazi Party, innocents struggling to keep body and soul together, and the petty criminals that make their living in a society turned topsy-turvy.  One of these criminals - oddly enough also with a heart of gold - helps add an element of \\"buddy story\\" to the whole.  Mr. Deaver has done his research, paints a detailed picture of the city, and forces us to confront the manipulative rot of Nazism that uses fear and bigotry to corrupt an entire country.   He does a remarkable job of showing us the beast in humanity, and humanity in the beast - to the extent that I wondered if some might find the monsters a little too likable.  Not to fear, though, Mr. Deaver - at least in this book - is nothing if not a moralist of high order. <br /> <br />Recommended as a page-turner, and as an insightful study of good, evil, and the land that lies between. <br /> <br />	2004-08-13

I felt the author, though enormously talented, had some problems with characterization, science, and plotting.  I'm pleased that with \\"The Scar\\" China Mieville has taken some real leaps as a writer. <br /> <br />This volume of what appears to be an ongoing alternate world saga takes place in the city of Armada, and Mr. Mieville's ability to give life to locations is one of his greatest strengths.  Armada is as fully realized a locale as the New Crobuzon of \\"Perdido Street Station.\\"  Armada is a floating pirate-city made up of a coalition of willing and unwilling vessels, and linked through an architecture that's mind boggling.   <br /> <br />Mr. Mieville also has a stupendous ability to imagine and give life to a motley, malign, and magnificent collection of  characters from vampires, to cactus-people, to \\"Remades,\\" to truly frightening mosquito people who can suck you dry in the blink of an eye; and, this time around his humans are much stronger than the somewhat stock characters of \\"Perdido...\\" <br /> <br />As to the science:  fantasy does require us to suspend disbelief, and Mr. Mieville uses the device of \\"thaumaturgy\\" to get through the patches where science won't work which gives him the tendency and ability to stretch scientific ideas about to the snapping point; and, in at least once instance (an episode with a bathyscaphe) he falls short of believability.  The more scientifically inclined reader may take more exception - I'm willing to let science slide in favor interesting (if not necessarily explicable) devices.  His explanation of \\"possibilities\\" is wonderful - and borderline. <br /> <br />Again, unlike his first novel, Mr. Mieville wraps his tale up believably and provides a motivated, logical, and satisfactory conclusion. <br /> <br />My only point of contention with Mr. Mieville's oeuvre is that with the exception of Bellis Coldwine (who I don't remember) hischaracters are not reoccurring from book to book.  I understand his latest, \\"Iron Bay,\\" also gives us a new cast.  I would like to hear more about Garuda from \\"Perdido...,\\" and there are a few characters in \\"The Scar,\\" notably Bellis, and Uther Doul, who I'd like to see again.  The up-side of not reintroducing characters is Mr. Mieville doesn't fall into the sequel trap of having to create more and more fantastic aspects to any one character, so I'll not fault him too much for creating a certain nostalgia for characters past.  In truth, it's a plus whenever a writer gives you a character evolved enough to stay in your mind. <br /> <br />I'm going to vote 5 stars for \\"The Scar.\\"  4  would be accurate, but with a talent this big why nitpick. <br /> <br />	2004-08-04

I was held captive. I then went on to the Lattimore translation, and for the third go-around back to Fagles - in print. I've also been reading around in some of the recent spin off literature: Elizabeth Cook's \\"Achilles;\\" Barry Unsworth's \\"The Songs of the Kings;\\" and Christopher Logue's awesome \\"All Day Permanent Red,\\" and \\"War Music.\\" <br />  <br /> Then along comes, \\"Ilium\\" by Dan Simmons - not the Iliad, but not not the Iliad. Dan Simmons has taken the plot and the players and mixed Shakespeare, Proust, and science fiction into a mind-bending cocktail worthy of a place on the top shelf. I've always thought the ancients brilliant in both their conception of an intersecting universe atop Mt. Olympus populated by gods with human failings and a neurotic interest in the doings of humanity; and humanity's behavioral rationale of being influenced by the gods - sort of a \\"the gods made me do it\\" excuse for bad behavior. Mr. Simmons has added the dimension of humans influencing the gods and moving their dynamic from family squabble to out-and-out civil war in an attempt to stop the carnage at the gates of Troy. <br />  <br /> There is nothing simple about this book. Characters taken from the source, and newly developed for the novel are given full lives; action is well painted; comedy, at a premium in the Iliad, is brought to the front; and pacing is brisk. I've always thought the purpose of retelling any story is to illuminate the original with new insight, and Mr. Simmons has not failed in this regard. He not only illuminates the old, but creates a context for the new. \\"Ilium\\" does not conclude the story Mr. Simmons has to tell, nor the lessons he has to teach, and I'm waiting for both in the up-coming sequel - \\"Olympos.\\" <br />  <br /> Highly recommended!  <br />	2004-07-27

He's gotten into the ring with the likes of Fagles, Lattimore, Fitzgerald, Pope, and most courageously, Homer himself - and acquitted himself well.  Mr. Logue has pulled \\"The Iliad,\\" into the 21st Century with less a translation than a re-write.  It appears there are numerous volumes containing sections of Mr. Logue's work, and it's a little hard to keep track, but two editions offered on Amazon.com's website, \\"War Music,\\" and the wondrously titled, \\"All Day Permanent Red,\\" seem to contain it all.  <br />Mr. Logue writes in a robust verse form that retains the epic language while exploring possibilities for a cinematic look on scenes and situations, as well as opening the field to modern metaphor.  Unlike Barry Unsworth's interpolations in \\"The Songs of the Kings,\\" Mr. Logue's don't jar, but rather deepen, and lift the story from some mythical past to something that is played out continually.  A great device considering \\"The Iliad\\" is arguably the blue-print for every war story ever written.<br />I think \\"All Day Permanent Red\\" would work for readers with no pre-knowledge of the source, and though I've been through at least three previous translations it certainly worked for me.  <br />Five Stars!	2004-07-15

Together they provide an interesting look at the horrors of religious fundamentalism in both its extreme and slightly more moderate aspects.  I've reviewed, \\"The Swallows of Kabul,\\" on its page.<br />\\"The Bookseller of Kabul,\\" is an interesting piece of non-fiction that seems to have been touched by the author's imagination in a way that allows it to move like a novel rather than a pure piece of reportage.  The author, Asne Seierstad, spent three months with Sultan Khan, the title's self-same bookseller, and if more factual than imaginative, became privy to the life and secrets of a family that though somewhat liberal should have kept their secrets a bit more private.  Of course, it's to our benefit they didn't.  It may also be to Ms. Seierstad's dismay as she faces Mr. Khan's (actual name: Shah Mohammed Rais) legal wrath.  Mr. Khan/Rais is upset that his guest chose to portray the family, especially himself, in such a negative light.  He has double reason to be upset:  whether or not, or how much Ms. Seierstadt embellished, Mr. Khan/Rais is going to come out looking like household tyrant - it's only a matter of degrees.  <br />For all its novelistic impulses and rhythms, \\"The Bookseller of Kabul,\\" is less a psychological portrait than a soap-operatic gloss of \\"three months in the life.\\"  We discover very little \\"why,\\" but quite a bit of \\"what,\\" and the \\"what\\" is less than pretty.  Whether it's the rape of a teenage beggar, or the marginalization of Mr.Khan/Rais's number one wife it seems that Ms. Seierstad's purpose is more to shine a light on Afghan misogynation than anything else, and in this she succeeds.<br />Whether pre or post-Taliban the Islam Westerners are only justbeginning to view, (a cultural benefit of war?) treats women as a distinctly lower form of life - meant to be kept literally in the shadows.  In fact, the omnipresent burqua ostensibly meant to protect women's and men's virtue, and whether in blue or black, reduces the wearer to the status of a shadow, neither to be viewed, acknowledged nor addressed.  Interesting that women are objectified in the heightened fashion of the West as well as in the reductio of the burqua.<br />As far as it goes, \\"The Bookseller of Kabul,\\" is a quick and interesting read, and another addition to the literature of the horrors of Afghanistan.  But what would really be interesting would be some insight into love's survival because what we're being told of Islam is that if love survives at all it's in a stunted form.  If true it's sad, and if not it's sadder still that we haven't heard differently.	2004-04-05

The first, \\"The Swallows of Kabul,\\" and the second, \\"The Bookseller of Kabul.\\"  The first is a novel, the second a work of non-fiction; the first concurrent with the reign of the Taliban, the second post-Taliban.  Together they provide an interesting look at the horrors of religious fundamentalism in both its extreme and slightly more moderate aspects.<br />\\"The Swallows of Kabul,\\" by Yasmina Khadra, an Algerian who writes in French and lives in Mexico, is a deep look into the minds of four main characters who suffer the psychological horrors of living through the era of the Taliban, and to read this book is to know the Taliban and the evil they have wrought.<br />\\"Taliban\\" is translated as \\"religious students,\\" but they are religious psychopaths.  They were organized to fight the Russians during their occupation of Afghanistan, and then to wage civil war against rival \\"mujahideen\\" - \\"holy warriors.\\"  The Taliban reached the height of their power between 1996 and 2001 when they were driven to the hills by the American forces reacting to 9/11.<br />In an effort to eradicate Western values in Afghanistan the Taliban instituted a regime marked by anti-pleasure (read \\"anti-life\\") extremism.  They were initially accepted by the citizenry as a corrective to the political corruption of the previous regime, but what they accomplished was a corruption of the spirit of a citizenry made fragile by years of war.  The Taliban were (and are)  militantly anti-democratic, anti-art, even anti-kite-flying misogynists who ruled through fear, torture, and public execution.<br />I can't speak to Mr. Khadra's French, but his translator has provided us with an English version that is readable if not as poetic as it tries to be.  What holds the book together is the insight Mr. Khadra brings to the ravages of the soul brought about by extreme Islamic fundamentalism, and the translation though a bit clunky doesnot unsalvageably mar Mr. Khadra's efforts.<br />I believe literature that strives to be great art is marked by its characters' pull toward redemption.  \\"The Swallows of Kabul,\\" is a plea for the redemption of the individual as well as the Afghan society - it's a shame it will be little read in the society about which it was written.	2004-04-05

Mr. Galloway seasons the telling with stories within the story, and it matters not whether they sprang full blown from his imagination, or are, in fact, the secret tales of the Rom.  They are marvelous inventions that root the family in an ancient culture, and help explain the vicissitudes of their time on earth.<br />Other than its obvious details, \\"Ascension,\\" is an aptly titled meditation on rising to the heights of your abilities, and maintaining your balance once the height is achieved.  All the characters, none more than Salvo Usari, climb above their circumstances, but one solid rule of physics wins out - what goes up, must come down.<br />\\"Ascension,\\" is a book for everyone.  It belongs on any adult, young/mature, or family reading list, and I hope, like the Usari family, it finds the audience it deserves.  Highly recommended.	2003-12-18

Author David Maranis has given us a few October days in the horrible history of the Vietnam era that define the entire period.  He writes with a strong sense of mission which is to chronicle the grief and glory of men at war as well as the confusion and altruism of a sector of the home-front that opposed it.<br />Impeccably researched from primary sources, \\"...letters...journal entries...archival documents, and interviews...,\\" Mr. Maraniss holds very little back as he follows the 2/28 Black Lions from disembarkation in Viet Nam through the jungle, and into battle and its aftermath - including a return of some vets to the battlefield 35 years later.  We are made witness to private thoughts and public actions, and a battle scene as detailed as anything in The Iliad - a touchstone for all war stories.  \\"They Marched Into Sunlight,\\" encapsulates  our entire Viet Nam misadventure, and is a classic look at infantry in action.<br />In roughly alternating chapters Mr. Maraniss also takes us to Madison, Wisconsin, and with the same detail as the Viet Nam sections into the \\"hearts and minds,\\" of the participants of a protest against Dow Chemical's recruitment drive on campus - a seminal action of the emerging anti-war movement.<br />To further enrich the story, Mr. Maraniss also provides snapshots of the machinations and be-suited terror of the beltway elite as LBJ and his staff decide the course of the war; and the private lives of the families the 2/28th left at home.<br />In October 1967 I wan an infantryman thankfully spending my time in Germany, but even from that safety I can attest to the author's grasp of the Army in all its greatness and folly.  After my hitch I was an active participant in the peace movement in Chicago, and I can again attest to the veracity of his portrait of the home-front - a confusion of beliefs, tactics, and actions guided by a genuine (though often self-serving) abhorrence of thewar, the politicians who started it, and in some, but not all cases, of the soldiers who fought it.<br />War is insanity and it infects and affects the national psyche as much as its active participants, albeit in different ways.  Mr. Maraniss has written an elegant and touching case study of a few days of that insanity and illuminated the entire era.	2003-11-17

A life-long New Yorker, he knows the city's parking regulations, and best spots like the back of his hand.  While exercising his right to park where it's legal, and his responsibility to feed the meter he manages to draw a considerable amount of unwanted attention from a host of fellow New Yorkers.  Murray becomes a guru to some, a pain to others (especially the spot-on caricature of Mayor Guiliani,) and a puzzlement to friends and family.<br />\\"Tepper Isn't Going Out,\\" is slight, but that doesn't make it less than delightful.  Mr. Trilling is known as a food writer, and I don't think he'd mind someone using \\"Tepper...\\" as the sorbet between weightier courses.	2003-10-20

Conversations invariably move to an overview of Hinduism, a religion that is quite foreign to Westerners.  Almost without fail my guests have voiced the belief that Hinduism is all myth, and not to be taken very seriously.  I've taken to asking these folks what makes Hinduism more a myth, or fiction, or literary construct than Christianity, and, to no surprise, they've failed to come up with an answer.  I'm sure if any of these folks had been dyed in the wool Christians I would have heard something about the revealed word of God, etc., etc., but they've been open-minded enough to ponder the questions and the implications of judging another's belief system based on their own.<br />With both, \\"God, a Biography,\\" and \\"Christ: A Crisis in the Life of God,\\" Jack Miles has opened the field of discourse by presenting the Primogenitor as a literary character rather than a factual being; and Christ as the same, regardless of his historical reality.  He has asked Christians to look at their God in much the same way we look at \\"foreign\\" Gods.  Was Krishna born on July 19, 3228 BCE, in Gokula, India?  Will he return at the end of the current age to usher in a time of peacefulness?   Was Jesus born on December 25th, 1 CE.  Will he return to judge the living and the dead?  To Hindu's Krishna walked, talked, made love, performed miracles.  To Christians Christ did the same (except, perhaps, made love.)  How much credence we give to any story depends on our orientation, but regardless of belief, the stories themselves are wonderful.  <br />One reason they're wonderful is they are rich in metaphor, and it's the metaphor that Mr. Miles explores to great effect.  Who can deny the beauty of an infant, and the idea of an infant knowingly giving love?  Who can deny the power in the story of God admitting an error and sacrificing himself in an attempt at rectification?<br />Mr. Miles's success is that he opens the metaphor, and forces us to think. <br />Although I'm not a huge fan of Mr. Miles literary style - in fact, I find it a bit stilted - what he has to say more than adequately compensates for the difficulty style presents. <br />Highly Recommended.	2003-10-17

He's gotten into the ring with the likes of Fagles, Lattimore, Fitzgerald, Pope, and most courageously, Homer himself - and acquitted himself well.  Mr. Logue has pulled \\"The Iliad,\\" into the 21st Century with less a translation than a re-write.  It appears there are numerous volumes containing sections of Mr. Logue's work, and it's a little hard to keep track, but two editions offered on Amazon.com's website, \\"War Music,\\" and the wondrously titled, \\"All Day Permanent Red,\\" seem to contain it all.  <br />Mr. Logue writes in a robust verse form that retains the epic language while exploring possibilities for a cinematic look on scenes and situations, as well as opening the field to modern metaphor.  Unlike Barry Unsworth's interpolations in \\"The Songs of the Kings,\\" Mr. Logue's don't jar, but rather deepen.  A sample line, \\"Ajax, grim underneath his tan as Rommel after `Alamein...\\" lifts the story from some mythical past to something that is played out continually.  A great device considering \\"The Iliad\\" is arguably the blue-print for every war story ever written.<br />When \\"War Music,\\" opens outside the actual text of \\"The Iliad,\\" and introduces us to Achilles - angry, petulant, bent on revenge, summoning his mother and laying grief for Agamemnon - Mr. Logue provides character depth missing from the original, and immediately lays out his plan to re-write and enrich rather than re-tell. His plan unfolds magnificently through both books.<br />I think \\"War Music\\" would work for readers with no pre-knowledge of the source, and I know it worked beautifully for me, and I've been through at least three previous translations.<br />Five Stars!	2003-10-17

I gave a stellar review to his first book, \\"War Is a Force that Gives Us Meaning,\\" and sent it to a young man graduating from high school in the hope it would help counter the effects of the jingoism we've been inundated with since 9/11.  This second book would make a great companion piece, but in my situation, and thank goodness, it's not necessary.<br />This is a book that should be required reading for any prospective service person.  Mr. Hedges has gone way out of his way to be factual, and objective, and let the facts speak. Its purposefully under-heated style reminded me of nothing else but the Baltimore Catechism, albeit minus the dogma.   If I had the wherewithal I'd supply every guidance counselor in the US with a few copies, and if I were the Secretary of any service branch I'd give a copy to every potential recruit; however, I neither have, nor am.<br />I do wonder as to the books potential efficacy in guiding someone away from the service - not Mr. Hedges' stated purpose by the way. Eighteen year olds are immortal - I was - as well as, \\"young, dumb, and full of cum\\" - I was.  Weren't you?  And certainly not prone to being guided by facts - especially when our recruiting efforts are so sexy.  Anthony Swofford in \\"Jarhead,\\" writes about Marine recruits watching war movies - even those considered to be \\"anti-war\\" movies - and tells us that our anti-war movies are just the opposite to the troops.  I can just hear a couple of prospective recruits reading about death's unraveling - \\"Cool...\\"	2003-07-23

Maybe the secret of \\"Salt,\\" like salt, is small doses.  That's not the route I took, though.  I figured I'd devour the text like any other book and finish it off in about a week.  I almost did, and then something else beckoned (actually, anything could have beckoned and gained my interest after a week of \\"Salt,\\") and I put the book aside with about ten or fifteen pages to go.  I haven't gone back to it.<br />One time I baked a whole chicken in a salt crust.  It was an experiment and lots of fun.  I mixed salt, flour, and water, to form a dough; flavored the chicken under its skin with tarragon, encased the chicken in the dough and baked it at 250 degrees.  After about 45 minutes I took it out of the oven, and the crust had become so hard I had to break it with a hammer.  The chicken was extremely pale, moist, and tender; but, man, was it salty!  With the tarragon, strangely pleasant, but a little went a long, long way, and I've never gone back to that, either.	2003-07-21

Where the former ripped through a fantasy-land of paranoia, the latter provides a deep exploration of wisdom, love, friendship, bigotry, betrayal, relative morality - and, well, a whole existential landscape.  <br />Mr. Pears uses the common literary device of telling three stories in three different historical periods.  My usual response to this device is to prefer one plot line, or set of characters over another.  Not so with \\"The Dream of Scipio.\\"  I found myself lost in each story, and believed equally in each character and set of circumstances; and, without belaboring the plot Mr. Pears managed to hold the threads of similarity between each story with a masterful hand.<br />My advice?  Skip the blockbuster, and go for the lower profile offering.  \\"The Dream of Scipio,\\" rewards with all the pleasures of an extremely well written tale.	2003-07-21

Primary, of course, is the battle between good and evil, with both usually embedded within the Catholic Church.  The good are generally comprised of conservative clerics tinged with liberal/humanist streaks; and the bad are either ultra-conservatives working through an obscure cult to bring the church back to some medieval purity, or out-and-out Satanists suckered by the Prince of Lies, and intent on destruction.  Satan, himself, has been known to make a personal appearance.<br />\\"Demons and Angels,\\" remains true to form but adds enough, shall we say, \\"Devilishly clever,\\" twists and turns to refresh the genre.  The ritual murder of a priest/physicist who has captured anti-matter in the labs of a Swiss Scientific Foundation provides the device that gets this page-turner ripping along.  We're quickly set up with an ever-resourceful he-man scholar, his gorgeous and ever-resourceful counterpart - who happens to be the priest/physicists adopted daughter; a slightly demonic lab director; an impossibly dull chief of Vatican security; and a \\"camerlengo\\" who may or may not be the second coming.  Author Dan Brown then throws in the cult of the Illuminati; the skullduggery of a Papal Conclave; art history; religious and scientific arcana; and enough Perils of Pauline cliff-hangers for two books.  This huge pot is Mr. Brown's undoing.  There's so much here that we have characters discussing art history, and religious lore as they're, literally, running between murders and acts of daring-do.  And there are so many such acts crammed into a twenty-four hour period that it becomes impossible to suspend disbelief -a fatal flaw for a thriller.<br />Had Mr. Brown managed to cut about 200 pages \\"Demons and Angels\\" would have been one hell of a book.  As it is, it's interesting, and exciting, but ultimately a failure.  Perhaps he does better with the \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" which on first look appears to be a second chance.  We'll see.	2003-07-07

Once when trying to count backward from 100 by 7's I started with 97, went to 93, and gave up.  Of course I was lying in a hospital bed, but even at my best I wouldn't have gotten far.  I tell you this because I approached \\"Isaac Newton,\\" by James Gleick expecting to read the introduction, pick up a few bits-and-bobs, and bail out.  What a surprise to find myself reading even while walking to the bus stop.  Thank you, Mr. Gleick for a fascinating biography that doesn't bog down in numbers, but still imparts the scientific information salient to Mr. Newton's life.<br />Isaac Newton was a piece of work.  A scientist, but also a student of biblical prophecy; a chemist, but also an alchemist; a public figure as well as something of a recluse; a fountain of learning who refused to publish.  Isaac Newton was a man of his times, and Mr. Gleick points out the very interesting paradox that Newton lived in a pre-Newtonian world.  Of course he would be filled with contradictions.  Even so, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Newton's contemporary and a philosopher/mathematician in his own right who found himself at odds with Newton by independently inventing differential and integral calculus, told the Queen of Prussia that &quot;in mathematics there was all previous history, from the beginning of the world, and then there was Newton; and that Newton's was the better half.&quot;<br />If you would like a better understanding of the laws of nature we take for granted, and an understanding of the life and times of the complicated man who formulated them for us, then I recommend this highly readable (and mathematically understandable) biography.	2003-05-23

Author Edward Marriott also takes us to the back alleys and shantytowns of Africa, India, and the US as he explains the course of bubonic-plague, and the standard reactions of doctors and politicians wherever there's an outbreak.<br />On a planet as small, with a population as fragile, it's a constant surprise that earth-dwellers have such difficulty doing the \\"right thing.\\"  \\"Plague\\" is a another chronicle of cupidity, and arrogance in medical research, thankfully blessed by the altruism of field epidemiologists who literally risked their lives to investigate a cause and cure for the \\"black death.\\"<br />The primary story is quite the thriller with two epidemiologists racing for an outcome -  Shibasaburo Kitasato and his team coddled by Hong Kong's British governor, and Frenchman Alexandre Yersin, working alone and hampered by the governor.  Although the results are history, \\"Plague,\\" is enough of a thriller that I won't spoil the pleasure for readers who are not medical historians.<br />\\"Plague,\\" had me glued to the page, and I recommend it to anyone who has a layman's interest in medical history.	2003-05-16

Two brothers embark on adventures of discovery; one is confronted by all the demons of war, and emerges somehow unaffected - the same character at the end of Gulf War One as at the beginning; the other confronts the demons of self-worth and addiction and though we are left with hope for his recovery, never find out for sure. Both stories are well told, and tie nicely together, and the details of war and addiction coupled with the background of family history work well in giving us a believable picture; but, resolution seems to be missing. Overall, I was left wanting more; either closure, or an indication the story would be continued, rather than the feeling of life just going on. But maybe that was the point.  Some people don't change much regardless of what they've been through, in which case I'd have to ask, \\"So what?\\"  \\"We Pierce,\\" is a good read, but guardedly recommended because of the lack of closure.	2003-05-07

In \\"The Songs of Kings,\\" Barry Unsworth takes that character defect even further by bringing us charlatans, manipulators, gangsters, and buffoons with only the most humble figure displaying any sign of heroism; and he shows us a war fought for an altogether different kind of booty.  It wasn't Helen the Greeks were interested in, it was plunder.  Mr. Unsworth has done nothing new, but he's done it quite well.  He takes the story of the days prior to the launching of the Greek fleet through a minor character's eyes, and reveals the stories behind the story.  He even goes so far as to show us how the official story may have been written with bribes and veiled threats directed toward the press of the day - the poet.  Mr. Unsworth moves onto a few patches of thin ice as he injects modern vocabulary like, \\"collateral damage,\\" into the dialogue, and in modernizing his characters, but all in all the effects work, and though they're never less than jarring they add an interesting dimension in the cumulative.  Mr. Unsworth has added well to the literature that has grown out of \\"The Iliad,\\" and though it's a minor work (especially compared to his magnificent \\"Sacred Hunger,\\") it is well worth the read.	2003-04-24

Even Christians who have chosen the cafeteria style of picking and choosing in the aisle of moral considerations are locked into fundamental beliefs vis a vis dogma, and those beliefs promote anxiety rather than life.  The more-or-less progressive brethren have abandoned Creationism for evolution, but still struggle with the virgin birth, resurrection, loaves and fishes, body and blood, and etc.  In \\"Doubts and Loves:  What is Left of Christianity,\\" Richard Holloway offers a reasoned approach that relieves dogma of the weight of institutional politics and survival, and presents a much more robust approach to Christianity.  The approach isn't new, but it is presented in an intelligent, heart-felt, and easily readable style that I found quite appealing.  Richard Holloway does not subvert the beauty and worth of Christianity.  He preaches \\"orthopraxis,\\" rather than \\"orthodoxy,\\" and gives new life to faith.  I recommend this book as a fresh way to approach the mysteries, and as a breath of fresh air in the musty cellars of Christian thought.	2003-04-16

It's maddening.  Either story would have made a book of its own, but author Erik Larson decided to link them with no solder other than proximity of time and space.  The story of Daniel Burnham and his army of architects, engineers, politicians, laborers, and hucksters building the Chicago Exposition does battle with the chronicle of Bluebeard style serial killer H.H. Holmes.  The author's tact is to give us a chapter or two of Burnham followed by a chapter or two of Holmes resulting in a fit of stops and starts to each story.  It wouldn't hurt the reading to mark Burnham's chapters against Holmes's and read each story separately - they are that disassociated.<br />Burnham's story is a wonder of architectural and engineering invention in which an entire city, \\"the White City,\\" is built in two years by 20,000 laborers during an economic depression.  The effort was to rival, or better yet, surpass the Paris Exposition; but what could beat the Eiffel Tower?  The first ever Ferris Wheel, with a 100 thousand pound axle, and thirty odd cars capable of holding sixty passengers apiece!  Pretty good.  Add landscaping by Olmstead, Little Egypt on the midway, and Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show next door, and Paris was whipped again.<br />Holmes.  Another story.  A genius of mass murder gassing  young and innocent girls and disposing of their bodies in a home-made crematorium in the basement of his home-made hotel.  Some he married and murdered, some he just murdered, and threw in a few children for sport.  A thoroughly nasty character, brought to justice by an intrepid private eye.<br />Like I said, great stories, but what they're doing alternating chapters only Eric Larson knows for sure.<br />All in all, though, a hugely enjoyable read.  The designer included maps inside the covers, but a photo section would have been a real plus.<br />Four and ahalf stars!	2003-04-04

I've liked the mix of humor, cynicism, and opera buffo that each of the stories contain, and expected something of the same with \\"Thanksgiving.\\"  To be sure, the book starts out with a weirdly comic confrontation between the recently bereaved Anthony and his deceased wife's ex-husband, but it's only the launching pad for a much deeper, more tender exploration of love, loss, and longing than you would expect.  This is a story of how sorrow can infiltrate a life and engender a fulsomeness equal to, or even greater than, the loss that prompts it.  It's a fairly quick read that provides much more than its beginning would indicate, and was moving enough to cause me a sob on the last page.<br />My only criticism of this novel is in a wish that Mr. Didbin had found a way to begin equal to the depth of the story that followed.<br />Caveat emptor:  Though \\"Thanksgiving\\" is of perfect length for airplane reading, don't read it while flying.  It  contains a description of an \\"airline disaster\\" that could keep you out of the air forever.	2003-04-02

As war stories go, \\"Jarhead\\" is right up there with the best of them.  <br />The Warrior is vain, foolhardy, courageous, prone to manic action or debilitating introspection, cruel, and sentimental.  Be it Achilles or Anthony Swofford; be it the sands of Ilium or Iraq, the technology may change but the warrior remains the same, and this is a warrior's story.<br />Anthony Swofford's literacy and self-awareness may have made him an oddity in the ranks, but in every other aspect he seems to have fit right in.  \\"Jarhead,\\" is the story of a boy who wanted to be a Marine, and who the Marines make into a man, albeit a man in extended adolescence - arguably the condition of every soldier, career or short-timer.<br />The full title of this book is, \\"Jarhead:  A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other Battles,\\" and the fact is the \\"Other Battles,\\" take up the majority of the book.   As wars go, the Gulf War was short and sweet, and for the number of troops engaged very few saw actual combat.  Mr. Swofford's experience was slight, but illuminating none the less.  The \\"Other Battles,\\" lead us to the war, and they were boot camp, training, and the interminable hurry up and wait of military life.  \\"Jarhead\\" is more the making of a Marine than the Marine in combat.<br />As it is, it's a book worth reading.  You will come away knowing the mind of a young Marine, and you will understand the sadness inherent in our need for warriors.	2003-03-31

She has also given us a literary guessing game as characters, quotes, and plots of the Bard's output come peeking around the corners of the story.  Ariel is a dream.  Her look into \\"fairyland\\" is often stunning in its invention.  I particularly liked the use of dew drops as a sort of Elizabethan era DVD.  There are points where the plot drags, but the book is short enough that we quickly move back along, and the excitement of fairy duels and life at court more than make up for any shortcomings.

As you've read, it's a multigenerational saga, and though the author distances herself from the Indian slant, it is, through and through, a novel of India.  <br />Bem Le Hunte places her story in rural India - the villages of the Himalayan region - and in that aspect as well as in the gentleness of the spirituality portrayed, it's unlike the seething urban dramas we've gotten used to.  It's also quite connected to the &quot;Ramayana,&quot; and a reader who knows that story will find many parallels in the wanderings of Aakash and Ram with Ram, Sita, and Lakshman.  The primary spiritual lesson is \\"god will provide,\\" and in this story god does provide - through thick and thin.  <br />Ms. Le Hunte has a good feel for class, caste, character, and Hindu cosmology and though the novel is a bit on the \\"fairy tale\\" side I found the reality to be grounded enough to keep the story on track.  She runs into difficulty when the venue shifts from village India to the hippie London of the 1960's.  Her grasp of the milieu seems much less sure, and the story seems to suffer for being rushed; and though she provides us with a touching conclusion, it's a little too \\"deus ex machina,\\" to be completely sasifying.<br />Even so, I recommend this book for its understanding of how the myths play out in daily life, and for an entertaining read.	2003-02-24

Oppenheimer transformed fire into nuclear fire, he became Prometheus and for his sins had his moral certitude eaten by the eagle of America's security establishment.  If taking history in the trappings of myth isn't your cup of tea, this isn't the book for you, but if you can see the work of myth through history, you may have an interesting time.<br />Author James Thackara has taken the last great story of the 20th century, the development of the Atomic Bomb, and recast it as myth.  \\"America's Children,\\" comes alive with the struggle between good and evil that lays at the reason for the Atomic Bomb's creation, use, and aftermath of science, violence, and industry that has resulted in a stockpile of bombs magnitudes more powerful than the first. <br />The scientists thought they were fighting the good fight.  The US had to beat Hitler to the atomic goods, and under Oppenheimer's direction the brilliant boys of Los Alamos did just that.  Though the bomb came too late to win the war with Germany, and was of questionable value in ending the war with Japan, it was dropped anyway. Its power was kept from the American public, but Oppenheimer knew what he had wrought, and though he was horrified, he had discovered the true nature of his creation, and we discover the true nature of the creators, at Trinity, the testing  site.  No one knew what would happen once this bomb exploded.  Would it blow a hole into Alamagordo, take out Albuquerque, or rend nature and destroy the earth?  As it was, it was the greatest explosion ever created, and the test was the greatest gamble science had ever taken, and its jackpot is a world under constant threat. Mr. Thackara, gives us a creator undone by his creation, and asks all the right questions about the morality of \\"pure\\" science, and of waging peace through the threat, and use of violence.  <br />As has been written about Mr. Thackara's magnum opus, \\"The Book of Kings,\\" there is a smaller book that could have been released from the 300 plus pages of \\"America's Children,\\" but even as it is there are ideas, and excellent pieces, (the test at Trinity, Oppenheimer's security hearing, the machinations of Dr. Teller) that make \\"America's Children\\" well worth reading.	2003-02-18

With &quot;The Great Indian Novel,&quot; Shashi Tharoor shows us that &quot;everything old is new again.&quot;  &quot;The Great Indian Novel,&quot; is a re-interpretation of the Mahabarata framed in India's struggle for independence, and the political aftermath of colonization.  The famous make their appearances under altered names, and Mr. Tharoor manages to make the Mahabarata current while making modern Indian politics somewhat understandable.  The book is also very funny.  I don't know if this is a book for the casual reader, but if you're interested in India I think you'll find it quite fascinating.	2003-01-22

This fictionalized biography follows Nureyev through most of his life.  It gives us the discipline, the passion - the obsessions - necessary to the fame Nureyev  achieved.  It also gives us the selfishness that comes with obsession, and a taste of the fabulous rewards that can so easily poison genius.  But ultimately, nothing was more important than the dance, and this is both the sadness and the splendor of the story.  The stage is Nureyev's redemption, but it is also his curse.  No matter how much love, joy, or suffering, no matter what riches, life is finally for the stage, and all the rest - grist for the mill.  Colum McCann is a fine writer.  He writes with formality, but also with a rush of experimentation, giving us the voices and visions, real and imagined, that guided Nureyev's life.  &quot;Dancer&quot; is not only a good read, it's also a meditation of one artist's creative process, and therefore an insight into the creative process per se.  I reccommend this book whether you are a ballet fan or not - it's an adventure, a romance, and a study, and well worth the time.	2003-01-22

It also answers the interesting question of what the Pope does with a job description that should put any Cardinal off the job.  Whatever the Pope does, from the intensely spiritual to the mundane, will satisfy no one.  Although Catholics are united in the Creed, we're polarized in the particulars, divided by scandal, and so spread out - geographically as well as ideologically - that someone or anothers ox will always be gored.  Nevertheless, Mr. Allen, has given us as close to an inside view of the procedures, politics, and personalities of a conclave as we're likely to get.  \\"Conclave,\\" also serves as a handicappers guide to the election with a rundown of factions, front-runners, and dark horses.  Ah, but what about the intervention of the Holy Spirit?  The cardinals are adepts of political power, but they are also deeply spiritual, and it's the spirit that is the wild card in any Conclave, and though that story is much more fascinating than the bargaining for a Pope, we'll never plumb the mystery of how that works, and the only author I can recall who explores that territory is out of print.  That would be Malachi Martin and his \\"Final Conclave.\\"	2002-11-18

It's a story of alchemy, Kabbala, demon possession, shape-shifters, vampires, and the attributes of a \\"just man,\\" told as a search-mystery; with locations various - Prague, London, Translyvania - but with little but the story to pull the reader into the magic that is, supposedly, all about.  Not only are action and locale left sketchy, but characters are somewhat vague as well.  Though we're given broad outlines no one but Magdelana, a horribly abused young woman desirous of knowledge, appealed on an emotional level.  I was left with the impression this novel was written a bit too quickly, and the author's decision to sacrifice detail showed either a lack of research, or a lack of interest.  I was looking for a good read in the fantasy genre, but got a sketch instead.	2002-11-18

Pope Alexander VI, nee Rodrigo Borgia, manipulated his and his illegitimate brood's way to the top of the European food chain using whatever means necessary, and their rise to power makes for interesting reading.  However, Mr. Puzo, and Ms. Gino tell the story in a style that never seems to fit history, historical fiction, or romance, and so becomes a hodge-podge of what may be the worst of all three.  The history is incomplete, the fiction is plodding, and the romance is overblown.  I finished the book because I love Vatican skullduggery, and it served as airplane and hotel reading, but as much as I'd recommend someone read about the Borgia's, I'd never recommend anyone do it with this book.	2002-10-16

Anyone who has followed Dylan's life and career can tell you Dylan is a man of many parts, but Scott Marshall, and Marcia Ford give us only two, and though the parts are interesting and well documented these 196 pages could have lost half their length without sacrificing anything of what we're told.  Dylan has been alive for 61 years, and producing for about 40.  He's hung out with beatniks, hippies, druggies, meditators, artists, poets, and musicians, and probably all stripes of seekers and believers, and I find it hard to believe his spiritual wanderings and wonderings were restricted to Judaism and Christianity.  There must be more, and \\"Restless Pilgrim,\\" would have been a much more interesting book if the authors had dug a little deeper.  As it is, it's an enjoyable read, but doesn't give us much depth.	2002-10-16

It's a \\"you are there\\" account of CIA covert actions in the Russian/Afghan war of recent vintage.  Milt Bearden, the author, has the cv. to get the geopolitics, and the internecine politics of the CIA, KGB, and Russian Army right.  Whether it's an interview with William Casey, a field interrogation, or a daring rescue by helicopter Mr. Bearden seems to keep it real.  True, he sticks to CIA success stories, but what the heck, in this one they're the good guys.  Where Mr. Bearden goes wrong is in his addition of a family drama instigated in Afghanistan and played out in Russia.  It's as though he didn't trust his story, so added an extra one for good measure.  Though it could have worked in a longer book, it got short shrift in this one, and its inclusion weakened all its parts.  A note of exception is the interweaving of a CIA traitor that was as dark and sad as needs be.  All in all, I'd recommend this book as a quick and exciting read, an interesting look at the psychology of a country we're not done with, and a good showing for a first novel.	2002-10-16

Chris Hedges in his memoir and cri de coeur, \\"War is a Force that Gives Us Meaning,\\" has given us a gift of experience, heartbreak, and wisdom that should be required reading for every young adult who may some day have to face a nation's jingoism and drive to war; and every adult who has ever thought war glorious, necessary, or worth the blood of a nation's youth.  His curriculum vitae are impressive.  He served as a correspondent in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, the Sudan, the Punjab, Iraq, Bosnia, and Kosovo covering foot soldiers and street fighters; and when he writes of the bloodshed, carnage, horror, and waste of war, he knows of what he writes.<br />In seven chapters Mr. Hedges takes us through a study of war that is somehow as thrilling as it is simultaneously repugnant, both scholarly and illustrative, his thesis is that war is an addiction that kills, if not the body, certainly the soul of every participant even as it gives a weird pleasure, or meaning to living.  <br />Mr. Hedges is a graduate of the Harvard Divinity School, and a student of the classics at Harvard in 1998-1999 as a Neiman Fellow, and he brings both a strong ethic and a classicist's knowledge of the great books to his memoir.  He's also a hell of a writer.<br />This is easily a five star book.  It has the power to change the way you think, and in that, the power to save lives.  Five stars, and three cheers!	2002-09-05

Greg Tobin gave us the clichés in \\"Conclave,\\" which was not great, but at least readable, and he repeats them all to less effect in \\"Council.\\"  Mr. Tobins' characters just don't rise above cliché, and regardless of the author's efforts to fill in with back-story, they're one dimensional throughout.  But characters are only part of the problem with this book.  The plot is telegraphed, the sex scenes are awful, trivial incidents are over elaborated, and attempts at weaving memory with \\"real time\\" stop rather than illuminate action or character.  <BR>   <BR>The author does have a few ideas about the politics of putting a \\"Vatican III,\\" together, and about how the event might turn out, but even these portions of \\"Council,\\" are not adequately developed. <br />The book begins with the incidents of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, and though those events help define one of his characters the novel seems to suffer from an opening that was opportunistically tacked in; or a book that was only a year in the writing and opportunistically published as close to the year anniversary of 9/11 as possible.   If the former, then shame for writing a bad book and merchandising it around the horror of 9/11; if the latter, shame anyway for a rush job that`s barely readable.<br />\\"Council,\\" also seems like book two of a series - perhaps a trilogy - and leaves events unresolved for the next installment.  I am a sucker for papal potboilers, so I'll probably read a third installment, used or remaindered, but in the meantime I'll say three Hail Mary's in the hope that book three (\\"Conciliation\\"?) doesn't repeat the purgatory of \\"Council.\\"	2002-09-04

Jersey City, NJ, has long been considered the most corrupt town in the US, and from Ms. Stapinski's history of crime and politics the town deserved its appellation.  It also seems her family deserved its place in the town, with a history of petty crime that started with the grandparents and ran its way through the generations.  Although \\"Five Finger Discount,\\" is localized, I think Ms. Stapinski has written about many Northeastern, immigrant, industrial communities.  I grew up in Erie, PA, and her stories were not foreign to me.  The numbers, the goods fallen off the backs of trucks, the crooked politicians and police figured enough in my life, and in the life of the Polish ghetto we finally escaped that \\"Five Finger Discount,\\" could have easily been about Erie, if not in kin, at least in kind.<br />The one shortfall of this memoir occurs within the memoir of place.  For a non-Jersey-ite I felt the extent of the history of Jersey City slowed the narrative.  I could have done with less.  For folks who live in the region, however, I'm sure the history will prove fascinating.  Whenever my interest would lag, though, \\"Five Finger Discount,\\" would return to the family.  The strength of the memoir lies in the melding of both, but for me the family stories proved more rewarding than the sociology.<br />I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in a good family story mixed with true crime.	2002-08-30

Rome has always seemed to me like a city just on the brink of anarchy.  After reading \\"Cicero:  the Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician,\\" I've had my impression enhanced.  Rome has always been a city on the brink of anarchy, and Cicero lived at a time when Rome had gone over the brink more than once.  Rome is an amazing city, and it has provided a home to amazing men.  Cicero was not the least of these, and by the title of the book, he may have been one of the greatest.<br />Cicero was a self-made man who spent a lifetime proving himself in the courts, in politics, and in literary output.  And prove himself he did, right up to his proscribed death.  Was he above cutting a deal?  No.  Did he defend the less than defensible? Yes.  Did he toady to those more powerful?  Sometimes.  He was, after all is said, a politician.<br />This book moves quickly, gives great insight into the times, and presents a title character as no more than human, and no less than captivating.	2002-08-30

It's essentially the myth of the hero, and our interest depends on the novelty of the adventures or trials our hero undertakes.  Quest stories also seem to depend on the hero's naivet, which often borders or crosses the line into all out stupidity.  \\"Sorcerer's Apprentice,\\" is no exception.  The problem is the quest doesn't seem all that important, and the outcome is a set-up without the thrill of discovery.  We learn a few tricks along the way, get a picture of an India few of us will ever see, but it's hardly worth the trip.  \\"Sorcerer,\\" also seems to be a misnomer implying wonders greater than any revealed.

He gives us three books in one, unfortunately none of them make up a very good book on their own or combined.<br />Book I, the shortest, and most personal is an account of Mr. Wills emotional and intellectual attraction to Roman Catholicism. Its interesting and intermittently touching, but more a pamphlet than anything else.<br />Book II: is a short history of the Church vis a vis the Papacy.  Interesting, if not a little dry, and Hans Kung did a much better job in his, The Catholic Church:  A Short History,  however the accounts of Pope John XXIII and Vatican II were fascinating.<br />Book III:  is Mr. Wills short, dry, and barely readable exegesis of the Apostles Creed.<br />The only other work by Mr. Wills that Ive read was, Lincoln at Gettysburg:  The Words that Remade America, and it was a stunning piece of research and writing.  I had hoped for more of the same, but what I got with, Why I am a Catholic, was mostly warmed over history.  Perhaps it works as a response to Papal Sin, but its flat on its own.	2002-07-23

From boyhood to his young adult death Mr. Dellilo's Oswald is a character in search of self who never gets there.  He's a shy, stupid, somehow charming boy who should be protected, but whose grandiose delusions would eventually put any protector off.  You'd miss him in a crowd - until he pulled a gun.  Oswald and Jack Ruby are the most defined characters in the book, with Oswald's mother weighing in with self-defining monologues that are a pleasure to read, but a pain to sympathize with.  She's a whiner with an interesting whine.<br />The remaining characters are thin, never as low-down as you'd expect, and don't seem at all realistic as plotters in the assassination of the century.<br />\\"Libra,\\" is not a mystery, not a thriller, not even much of a drama.  If anything it's a meditation on character - or at least on Oswald's character.  I'd recommend it for the beautiful writing, (phenomenal dialogue) but certainly not as a page-turner.	2002-07-23

He snared me with prose that reads like a shoot-out in \\"American Tabloid,\\" and kept the pressure on for 700 pages of, \\"The Cold Six Thousand.\\"  And the story he has to tell...  If I ever thought the counter-culture of the the sixties was made up of rock and rollers and flower-children, these books have disabused me of that notion.  The counter-culture of these books is the world of the bad, and the ugly struggling for power in their private and public relationships.  Unlike \\"American Tabloid,\\" though, there are two or three good guys in the sequel.  Not that Mr. Ellroy will allow anyone to be all good, nor should he, there's no entrance for the pure in this story's arena.  Like \\"American Tabloid,\\" there are urges to redemption, but whether or not anyone makes it is up to the reader to find out.  \\"The Cold Six Thousand,\\" continues the arc of \\"American Tabloid,\\" and gives us an American history from November 22, 1963, to June 9, 1968.  From JFK's assassination to the week following RFK's murder in Los Angeles.  There's no mystery to the ends of Bobby, Martin, and John, but I still found myself with the \\"oh, no, not again\\" reaction of learning these things for the first time, and there is quite a bit of mystery to our knowledge of the conspiracies that surrounded the events.  Mr. Ellroy introduces us to the conspirators, their motives, and methods.<br />\\"The Cold Six Thousand\\" also gives us a much deeper look into the personal lives of the protagonists (it would be a stretch to call them \\"heroes\\".)  That look tends to slow the plot, but the writing is deep, and there's a father-son story that would give the Greeks pause.  <br />Dissertations are going to be written about these books, they're that rich, and I read on a website there's a third volume in the works.  I highly recommend them to anyone interested in modern fiction, American history/myth, or the morality of a world where winning is all.	2002-07-13

There are no good guys in \\"American Tabloid,\\" just guys who are mired in various levels of corruption.  Ankle deep, waist deep, and in over their heads.  One of the lessons James Ellroy gives us is that once you've touched your toe to the muck it will eventually suck you down.  Redemption may present itself, but Ellroy's characters are so far around the bend that even good things are done for all the wrong reasons.  In an introduction Mr. Ellroy tells us he's going to create the new myth of the Camelot years - the dark myth - and he succeeds admirably.<br />In the tautest prose between covers we follow a handful of near and complete psychopaths as their lives intersect through John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign, and his 1000 day reign.  Big shots and underlings alike.  Their machinations are complex, and almost always involve extortion, but solutions are often simple - a beating for a lesson, a bullet to the head for the more recalcitrant.   But why stop there when torture, and dismemberment are so fulfilling.  The lead characters suffer, but except for one ex-Jesuit seminarian become FBI agent, become mob lawyer, the suffering is physical rather than existential, and it's so much easier to deal with a migraine than a crisis of conscience.<br />\\"American Tabloid,\\" for all the horror contained therein, is one of the best books I've read in the past five years.  It's right up there with Cormack McCarthy's \\"Border Trilogy,\\" but where McCarthy can go sentimental, James Ellroy never lets up.	2002-07-05

Between these book-ends, Washington, Franklin, Madison, and Abigail Adams, make their appearance as we watch the birth of a nation.  \\"Founding Brothers,\\" makes clear the primary task of our first leaders, and that was nationhood.  All other questions, including the most burning issue of slavery, were secondary.  Without the primacy of nationhood, nothing else could be accomplished, and these men knew full well the import of their actions.  Part of their greatness was in acting for the ages.  Whatever narrow interests they may have held, they knew they would ultimately be judged on accomplishing the first task.  Abigail Adams, possibly the most literate woman of the time, is the only woman to figure in this history.  She is portrayed as equal to her husband, wise and gracious in her own right.<br />Joseph J. Ellis has done a magnificent job of bringing us both the drama, and the intricate arguments that surrounded the issues the \\"brothers\\" dealt with.  Reading this book has brought me an understanding of American democracy, then and now, and I recommend it to anyone who cares about why we are what we are.	2002-07-02

It's the boy meets girl story with God substituted for the girl.  There's nothing wrong with the formula, the author's job is to make it fresh and interesting.  Dan Wakefield doesn't get the job done.  The structure of \\"Returning\\" is linear, the pace is ponderous, and the insights only moderately interesting.  In fact, the entire book is an exercise in moderation, written by a moderate talent, who, on the evidence presented, has lived a moderate life.  It's no wonder Bill Moyer's, a paragon of moderation, liked this book.  There are parts of this book where the author could have revealed more.   The account of his nervous breakdown is scary, but all too brief, and on too many occasions - bouts of adolescent [activity], unsuccessful psychoanalysis, addiction to alcohol - Mr. Wakefield seems like a kid in a confessional.  He rushes through his sins in order to be unburdened, but also undiscovered.  It doesn't work.  If we give the penitent the benefit of our attention, he should give us the benefit of a compelling story.	2002-06-26

James Reston got the dirt on the primary English and French players and has no temerity about spreading it around.  Who was the regal counterpart Richard the Lionheart was sleeping around with?  You'll find the answer right here.  Care for a look at the private life of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine?  Step right up.  Who was the \\"whore of Europe?\\"  Yes, indeed, find out here.  As for the politics, both in Europe and the East, well, nothing much has changed in the modus operandi of the ruling class.  Richard fought a bloody war on the battlefields, and deadly political wars on the two fronts of Europe and the Holy Land.  Yes, the underlying current was a holy war, but the profiteers, looters, and opportunists steered events as rigorously as the warriors and clerics.  Mr. Reston has much less to say about the peccadilloes of Saladin and the warriors of Islam.  In fact, they come off as models of rectitude, both in their private and public affairs.  However, both sides were equally as blood-thirsty, and the blood flowed ankle deep--such were the times, such are the times.<br />Mr. Reston focuses quite clearly on Richard and Saladin as the protagonists of this third crusade, and in them he has found characters as large as life.  They were educated, wily, impassioned leaders whose stature has not been diminished by the passage of nine hundred years.<br />I recommend this book both for the dirt and the history.  It's a fascinating look at characters and events, as well as a witness to how the Crusades have never really ended.	2002-06-04

If an unexamined life is not worth living, then an unexamined country is not worth loving.  Even as Mr. Vidal reviews our national foibles, examines our errors, and dissects our politicians his love of the founding principles of this flawed democracy shine through.  There is no doubt as to Mr. Vidal's erudition, but he is also wickedly funny.  Mr. Vidal is a political and social aristocrat that gives him name-dropping rights to the 20th century, and drop names he does.  He's had dinner with everyone who matters, and it seems he's read everyone who matters more.  Whether he's unveiling the secrets of America's entrance into WWII, or punching holes in Kenneth Starr's multi-million dollar investigation into Bill Clinton's peccadilloes he is unerringly on-the-mark.  Gore Vidal is Noam Chomsky with a sense of humor, and the thinking persons' Michael Moore.  These essays are a fascinating look at America, and a great read to boot.	2002-05-10

About a month ago, desperate for something I could loose myself in, I picked up \\"The Golden Compass.\\"  It was in the \\"young - mature\\" or some-such section of the bookstore, and I was put off until I read the frontpiece.  It seems to me any book that begins with a (truly frightening) quote from \\"Paradise Lost\\" deserves a much broader placement than \\"young - mature.\\"  <br />I raced through the trilogy, glad the only wait I had to experience between volumes was the time it took to catch my breath.<br />\\"His Dark Materials,\\" is a deep climb into myth and archetype that is the hero's journey, a critique of organized religion, a travelogue of alternate worlds, and a breathtaking adventure.  Philip Pullman has pulled together a cast of characters that seems to touch on the entire diversity of Western mythology, including the wild-western; as well as every dark bedroom fear of childhood.  The trilogy is grounded in the coming-of-age story of his protagonists (Lyra and Will), and flies into fantasy with the telling of a new age in the universe.  <br />As a writer Mr. Pullman works a dynamic that races with gore and violence, gentles in natural idyll, provokes with psychology, philosophy, theology, and what some would call \\"heresy,\\" and compels with deft plotting, and well crafted characters.<br />I'm glad I read this series as an adult, wish I had read it as a 12 year old, would recommend it to the mature young reader with no hesitation, and to the older reader who has not lost his or her sense of wonder.	2002-03-26

First was the Robert Rossen film starring Richard Burton.  It was 46 years ago, and though I dont remember much detail I do remember Alexander cutting through the Gordian Knot, his affection for the warhorse Bucephalus, and the deaths of Hephaestion, and Alexander  his soldiers walking past his death bed.  I was struck by Alexanders loyalty, and his emotional depth.  Next came a voracious reading (and later re-readings) of Mary Renaults romantic trilogy.  The brave son, the bold warrior, the loyal friend  founder of cities, lover of women and men, etc., etc; heady stuff for a boy entering adolescence.  And though my intellectual interest in Alexander waned, his life as reflected in those works marked me.  <br />Not too long ago I read The Soul of Battle by Victor David Hanson and came to learn that not everyone held Alexander in the same esteem.  I think Hanson may have even called him a butcher.   It finally dawned on me, of course, world conquest is not an act of loving kindness.  A man could not be responsible for that much death and destruction and not be a brute.  I figured I had to read something other than fiction to get a more accurate accounting of my boyhood hero.  <br />The Amazon.com site ran a review of Alexander of Macedon that caught my eye with the claim that Peter Greens biography was one of the finest.  I was immediately pleased with the title, Alexander of Macedon rather than the expected, Alexander the Great.  The book is not a difficult read, in fact, for history its often quite breezy.  The Alexander portrayed is no less a wonder than I always thought, but much more a human.  Alexanders greatness, according to Mr. Green, was somewhat erratic, as he could be both great and petty but not in equal measures.  The pleasures of slaughter, rape, and plunder were much closer to Alexanders soul than the pleasures of the palace, or the intellectual pleasure of bantering with philosophers.  Alexander was an intriguer from childhood, with as great a genius for self-promotion and manipulation as for war; and as great a thirst for alcohol as conquest.  <br />Mr. Green has obviously plumbed the sources.  His book opens the worlds of Macedonia, Greece, and Persia.  He gives us a supporting cast equal to the times, and, finally, Mr. Green gives us a life, as short as it may have been.  Alexander died at 33, and his empire went quickly into collapse.	2002-02-15

Hans Kung's brilliance as an author and a theologian is not to be faulted, and in this volume he shows us how the Roman Catholic Church has survived 2,000 years in spite of itself.  There is very little new here for anyone who has read church history.  For those who haven't, the author rips through 2000 years with the highlights, and he basically tells us that good leadership has been the exception in Roman Catholocism, rather than the rule.  The rule has been power politics at the expense of strengthening and sustaining a religious structure that serves the spritual needs of its members.  At least, until Pope John XXIII and his miraculous Vatican II - ultimately betrayed by every succeeding Pope.  The author's ire is especially aimed at John Paul II who's pronouncements to the world at large have been borderline progressive, though not followed by much action; and his pronouncements and actions to the church family which have been ultra-conservative.  I have no disagreements with Kung's history or analysis, however, he weakens his case by using the final chapters to carry on about his own troubles with the Pope and the curia.  This failing aside, Kung (whose volume &quot;On Being a Christian&quot; helped bring me back into the fold)gives us a factual and highly readable account of Mother Church, and some basic proposals for a Vatican III that could re-energize Roman Catholocism, and bring our Church into a more democratic model of a &quot;people's church&quot; in the new century.  I won't be holding my breath, though.	2001-12-17

Im torn between praise and the knowledge that something went wrong.  First the praise:  China Mieville is a monstrously inventive writer.  His storys locale, New Crobuzon, a city built under the bones of some huge animal, is an urban nightmare.  If I could place it in reality it would be some huge and corrupt 3d world metropolis where anarchy rules, and the city functions by a somewhat malign grace.  New Crobuzon is place where beauty is hard-won, and where most relationships are built on self-interest rather than affection.  Mr. Mieville does a wonderful job of opening the city to his readers, and the tour is lengthy, and interesting in all its sordidness. <br />His characters would be as at home on Desolation Row as anywhere.  They are broken, corrupt, wounded, disfigured, and damaged as much in love as in selfishness.  They are drawn from mythology  pop, and ancient. The most human of the characters are the least interesting  and they form the pop mythology as well as the first signs of trouble in execution. We are given the brilliant but disaffected scientist, the struggling artist, the revolutionary journalist, and the criminal with a code none of whom live up to the grandeur of the ancients or the villians.  The Weaver, a spider who weaves and mends the web of reality is a wondrous creation, the Ambassador from Hell who is a frightening as the place he represents, and the vampire moths who are central to the action and rate with the worst vampires of literature are much more memorable than the heroes of this story.  Except for Garuda (a fallen angel of sorts) the bad guys get the best of it.  The good guys are clever, artistic, and brave, but theyre really no match for the evil they face, and I suspect they succeed only because the author wants them to  not because they deserve the victory. <br />More trouble is that Mr. Mieville tends to invention for its own sake.  His story rips along andthen gets bogged in its own flights.  It is a huge leap for an author to claim the discovery of a unified theory, and its a huge failure to loose clarity in an explanation that stops the plot and ultimately explains little.<br />The final bit that stops me from moving this book to 4 stars is the transformation of Garuda  a noble and broken character who the author has pulling up his socks and moving into the future in a most unconvincing way.<br />Given all this,  Perdido Street Station is a marvelous failure and a fascinating read.  I was going to give my copy away but decided to hang onto it for a possible re-reading	2001-12-06

Opinion tends to polarize.  Hawks v. doves.  Even when national consensus as to necessity is met, it comes with provisos that baffle politicians, and hamstring the military.    &quot;The Soul of Battle:&quot;  should be read by anyone who has ever questioned the validity of war as a problem solving mechanism.  In this book, Victor David Hanson looks at three wars, three societies, three armies, three major campaigns, and three generals and presents us with a comprehensive picture of not only the reasons for just war but, how war can be waged with justice, or in Gen Sherman's phrase, &quot;a more perfect peace,&quot; as the outcome.  My sense of idealism gives me hope that the world may, some day, experience total peace, but reality tells me that that far future day will be preceded by war after war - large and small.  That being the case, it's good that someone offers a perspective of war's moral environment.  The three wars in \\"The Soul of Battle:\\"  are the Theban war against Sparta, the American Civil War, and World War Two.  Mr. Hanson charts the similarities in those wars, as well as the similarities in the other sets of three mentioned above.  His prose is strong, and the three sections of the book are united (though they could stand alone with no loss.  In fact, I read the book from back to front without any difficulty in comprehension or flow.) The only problem I see with the writing is in repetition of detail, and in the fact that Mr. Hanson presents his material in the tone of a true believer.  He has a tendency of belittling argument contrary to his.  Ultimately, though, the arguments that Mr. Hanson posits, and the facts (and opinions) to buttress his case make for fascinating reading.  His portraits of the fighting generals could also stand alone as studies in leadership.  All in all, Mr. Hanson provides plenty of grist for the mill for any of us who wish toponder this particular imponderable, and it's a page-turner to boot.	2001-11-06

Clinton Heylin has an artist's feeling for the life of art, and he finds in Dylan an anti-Humpty Dumpty with the incredible ability of falling apart and putting himself back together again and again.  By his own admission Mr. Heylin picks up where Robert Shelton leaves off, that is, with Dylans middle years and into the present.

Bob Dylan is the archetype of the troubled genius who has reached his senior years as a person and an artist with integrity and skills intact.  In a 40 year career Dylan has made plenty of choices: good, bad, ugly, and awesome.  Hajdu and Sounes trample over Dylan's soul, Mr. Heylin explores his creative heart.	2001-10-01

I don't think any of us in our callow youth would fare much better as personalities, the problem with this book is that Mr. Hajdu doesn't have much of a feeling for the art that came out despite the creepiness of the milieu.  It's a problem he shares with Howard Sounes's &quot;Down the Highway:  The Life of Bob Dylan.&quot;  Both books rank as over-inflated tabloid fodder.  As far as giving us a feeling for the Greenwich Village folk scene - well, we catch a whiff of its seedier aspects, but Mr. Hajdu hasn't been able to find much joy in it all.  If you'd like to check out a well written, critical biography of the troubled and talented Bob Dylan, I'd suggest, &quot;Behind the Shades:  Take Two,&quot; by Clinton Heylin.	2001-10-01

It completely outstrips Edith Hamilton, and challenges Joseph Campbell's position of superiority as a mythologist - at least as far as the Greeks are concerned. With &quot;Ka: Stories of the Mind and Gods of India,&quot; a retelling of the Hindu myths, Mr. Calasso falls short of &quot;...Cadmus and Harmony.&quot; The book is quite interesting both in style and content, but it's in style that Mr. Calasso fails. First to content: Hindu mythology provides a wonderful field for the imagination because it seems to exist in thought, that is to say, in the mind. This book even tells us in its title that that is where we're going to be dwelling. Events occur on earth, but are not really earth bound. Ka, the first character in this mythology is the first thought, and all else exists in this thought - or in the thoughts of the thought. Perhaps, ad infinitum. Yes, Lord Krisna, the beautiful prankster and lover has a family, a sexuality, and an affect on humanity; but, his life is more in the cosmic imagination than the created world. The same is true of the other characters, except for the author's foray into the life of the Buddha. It's here, with the Buddha's challenge to Hinduism that the preceeding pages are brought together because we are finally brought to earth. Interestingly enough, the Buddha subdues &quot;mind,&quot; and if it is true that the Hindu creation exists only in the &quot;mind,&quot; or thought, then the Buddha has also subdued an entire cosmology. Mr. Calasso believes the Buddha's challenge was to the notion of sacrifice, I think, by Mr. Calasso's telling, the challenge was more radical. Regardless of the character's lack of solid form, the stories are compelling. Creation, the balance of life, its destruction, and the cycle's foreigness to Western thought could only be dull in the telling of a dolt. Mr. Calasso is not a dolt. But, he may be too clever. Which brings us to style: Mr. Calasso can tell a story, but in &quot;Ka&quot; he falls in love with stylization. This is a minor flaw in &quot;...Cadmus and Harmony,&quot; in &quot;Ka&quot; it is a major distraction. It's also an interesting dilemna because it appears that Mr. Calasso has attempted to re-imagine the book as mind itself. Reading becomes telepathy - which in a sense, it always has been. When we read, we are reading the author's mind. Here we are reading the author's mind read the mind of Ka, which is the mind of all creation, and Mr. Calasso's skill as a stylist isn't great enough to keep things from running amuck. However, his attempt is valiant, and it shouldn't keep you from giving this book a try, and from keeping it on your shelf for a re-read - or two.	2001-09-01

More importantly Roberto Calasso explores their ramifications on modern times.  And, he does it in a scholarly and entertaining way that never pulls us from the full world of ancient Greece that he recreates.  Oh, those gods and goddesses were steeped in gore, and would wreck whatever havoc was necessary to have their ways with humanity and each other.  The blood of every hero seems to begin with a sanctified seduction or rape, and end in a pool either before the gates of Troy, or as a result of that ten year war.  Not to say that the humans act or fare any better than their divine counterparts.  The greatest among them were small in their motives as they pursued homicide, parricide, matricide, infanticide and every other side of slaughter they could summon into being.  But, as small as they were, they were heroes; and, as petty as they were, they were the gods; and their actions, reactions, and inactions shaped and continue to shape Western culture. &quot;The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony&quot; is a fitting companion piece to &quot;The Iliad&quot; and &quot;The Odyssey,&quot; and stands alone as a thrilling tale of the mortal and immortal excesses that have formed us.	2001-08-14

She gets to the heart of the matter, and doesn't hold off on personal opinion.  I didn't know what to expect from her fiction, but I was surprised.  She seems like a different writer.  A gentle side comes through &quot;A River Sutra&quot; that leaves you feeling deeply for the characters she's created.  It's not that the stories are fluff, they're not; it is that she employs a lyricism that was unexpected.    The river is the Narmada, one of the holiest in India; and, a sutra is both a thread, and a discourse that constantly unwinds. This aptly named book is a study of love, and another look at India - sometimes fanciful, sometimes frightening, but always warm hearted.	2001-08-08

And how a Russian in Cuba gets home-style pickles is a mystery unto itself. <br />Mr. Cruz Smith is a master of atmosphere and character.  In his series he takes us from Moscow, to the Bering Sea, to Havana, and each locale is another vision of hell on earth.  He has a detailists eye, and whether it's the slick of oil on water, the tactile pleasure of a cold can of beer, or the sound of cloven hooves on marble he awakens each scene with particulars.  Havana is a city being slowly strangled by economics and regressing to the corruption and lust for the tourist dollar of the Batista era.  <br />Mr. Cruz Smith's characters are neither black nor white, but the moral gray of humans under stress.  Yes, the good guys are good, but they are also flawed, and that accounts for much of their attraction.

Mr. Cruz Smith doesn't sketch, he paints.<br />Settle back, read, and you are there - have a good time in hell!	2001-04-19

Rooted in history, peopled by historical characters, resplendent with magical realism; this is a journey through times, attitudes, and obsessions that end fantistically but believably.  Mr. Adrian's sure touch took me into a spiritualist reality that jostled but somehow never upset the grounding of army camps, battlefields, and the streets, hospitals, and drawing rooms of Civil War era America.  Family, memory, grief, blood, and the inventiveness of humanity are the bedrock of this story; and anyone who has pondered the ultimate mystery of death will find something here. Mr. Adrian's action proceeds from character, and that is the solid ground of this novel.  Of course the action would unfold in just this way, the characters demand it. I highly recommend &quot;Gob's Grief,&quot; you will finish it as if waking from a dream - all wondrous and strange.	2001-04-05
US	52469742	R3QSQTUGAV67R8	0006375952	686635283	City of Djinns	Books	5	7	8	N	N	The Absolute Best	&quot;City of Djinns&quot; is by far the best travel book I've ever read.  It transcends the genre.  It was given me by an historically minded Delhi-wallah, and he couldn't have offered a better volume.  Mr. Dalrymple not only spent a year in Delhi, he spent centuries in the history of the 7 Delhis that have been built and lost.  This is not a &quot;go here, see this&quot; sort of travel book.  It is a &quot;discover the wonder&quot; book.  Modern Delhi is a mess of a city, but Mr. Dalrymple takes us deeply beyond the mess into the wonder that exists and the magic that was.  The incredible political and family history of Shah Jehan the founder of Delhi (Shahjehanabad)is the &quot;Godfather&quot; story of family members who would stop at nothing to win the empire.  There is a severed head in this story that makes the horse's head in &quot;The Godfather&quot; look like child's play.  This small portion of &quot;City of Djinns&quot; is worth the price of admission.  I've spent a few months in Delhi, and this book would have made a better introduction than any of the usual guidebooks, as it is, it will make my return to the &quot;City of Djinns&quot; all the richer.	2001-04-02

Dalyrmple's &quot;City of Djins&quot; have been the best.  Gita Mehta is an exceptional writer who manages to combine fact and emotion in a series of elequent essays.  The last 50 years in Indian history - her first 50 years of independence - are a swirl of social change in a country that is aswril in its every moment.  When you think &quot;India&quot; you must think of a dance of a billion richly colored veils.  Ms. Mehta plucks veil after veil from the dance and by describing the veil she describes India.  It's a remarkable achievement, and a real insiders view into the politics, arts, and life of an extremely complex nation.  Ms. Mehta captures India in a short 220 pages and in doing so presents a view that other authors might take volumes to display.  Highly, highly recommended!	2001-03-30

Anger/Love, Pain/Healing, even the two faces of Comedy/Tragedy go hand in hand in this realistic and magical look at a young, Indian rock and roll band - Coyote Springs - and the people and spirits that appear in their orbit.  Sherman Alexie has a deep understanding of the results of a people's total colonization; and a realistic understanding of the truth that redemption never comes easy and tragedy is a fact of life.  Beyond the pleasure of reading a story well written is the pain of being given a clear-eyed look at the horror wrought by our United States' western expansion.  Mr. Alexie gives you the feeling that even a war fought to extinction will never end because spirits will inhabit the land, but he also provides some hope that spirits may heal.	2001-01-10
US	52469742	R1RAMZY18GUB61	0881843555	694370386	Nightrunners of Bengal	Books	2	13	34	N	N	A great read, but biased and inaccurate	&quot;Nightrunners of Bengal&quot; is an exciting and masterfully written gathering of lies and half-truths written from an obvious pro-colonialist viewpoint.  It is also a classic of the genre. A telling example of the author's bias is that Indians refer to the, so called, Mutiny of 1857 (the central event of the novel) as the First War of Independence.  John Masters considers it to be no more than a Sepoy Rebellion made incoherent by religious fanaticism.  His take on the Rani of Jhanci who was a prime mover in the war is of a hysterical nymphomaniac rather than a woman with deep self interest in the preservation of her successor and a patriot.  This is not to say that every historical instance is corrupted, but enough to sway opinion away from the Indians. Inaccuracy and bias beside, the author does provide an interesting study of the nature of loyalty.  Is it to God, king, country, or contract?  His final take focuses on the Bengal Lancers refusal to join the war on the side of their countrymen because they had willingly agreed to serve the Crown (or its surrogate, the East India Company).  The Lancers are his heroes precisely because they honor the contract.  A man does what he promises to do.  My Indian friends find this to be a bit disingenous. I admit, though, prior to learning a few facts I was quite taken by this novel.  It is a page turner and a thriller.  The sad fact is the truth would have been every bit as compelling as the author's fabrications.	2000-11-02
US	52469742	R1M1P1LYFT9AL6	0449906043	708463890	Karma Cola	Books	4	27	28	N	N	Karma Cola maintains its fizz...	I've come to this book a little late in its publishing history, and though the story is dated in terms of the mass of seekers who descended on India in the 60's and 70's westerners still seek the &quot;wisdom of the east,&quot; and this Karma Cola has not lost its fizz. This is an angry, critical, sarcastic look at the rage for inner peace that has driven many seekers to psychiatric care, and many gurus to the bank.  It's also a book filled with sadness as Gita Mehta both castigates and mourns - for her country's spiritual traditions stacked into the supermarket of the latest craze; and for the naive who believe hard won self-knowledge can be had with the touch of a teacher's hand - or a certain less visible appendage.  It's finally true that if you can't find peace and love at home you probably won't find it in India either.  Besides, six thousand years of spiritual and cultural history just shouldn't be toyed with.	2000-10-02
