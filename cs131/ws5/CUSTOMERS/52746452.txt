It is written by a guy who has followed Colin Powell around and has taken a lot of notes on what he has said.  He then put together a bunch of Powell's stories and comments into this book.  The &quot;secrets&quot; are not secrets at all.  They are common sense to most people.  After the first couple of chapters I realized that I was wasting my time trying to read each word and just went to the summaries at the end of each chapter.  It's all summed up there.  Powell did not contribute to this book, he was merely a speaker who fed the author enough information to pull this book together.	2004-01-20

I bought this book after seeing the author on a local cooking show.  I am so impressed with the layout, pictures and plans...it's just what I've been waiting for as a cook.  She lays out in detail a menu and what you are doing with the food 3 days ahead of the party, 2 days, etc up until the day of the dinner party.

The problem I have with this book is that Tracy spends a lot of time saying some very simple things like how our view of ourselves are often wrong.  I also notice that when Tracy writes about goals he assumes that everyone has a goal of increasing their income.  Granted, we could probably all find a use for more money whether for ourselves or to help others, but the assumption isn't necessarily true and I find it occassionally distracting while reading.  He makes statements about us obviously having goals to make more money when in actuality many may just want to have more friends, be healthier, etc.  In fact, a balanced approach is far better for us anyway.  Tracy tends to have a biased approach toward making more money, probably based on his years as a salesman in search of a quota.	2003-12-29

I was pleasantly surprised!  We were not talked down to about how our spiritual energy is being drained or how our psychological well being is being damaged, the author views organizing as practical and necessary for good business.

This book is such a welcome addition to my book shelf.  I tried so hard last year to try to translate manufacturing value stream mapping to the transactional world and found it very difficult.  This book simplifies the approach incredibly.  There are some typos in the book as well as one figure that is missing some icons.  The bad part about the book is that it does seem to spend a lot of time saying the same thing over and over and over again while skipping over some very important VSM concepts like dealing with multiple flows, etc.  You need to have a good background in VSM and lean in order to absorb this book easily.  I appreciate the fact though that the authors try to demonstrate the tools on three or four examples throughout the book, but why not put in a few other case studies all the way through???!!!  I hate having just one complete case study like in the book Learning to See.  Not all situations are the same so having several examples can be very helpful.	2003-04-25

I didn't feel as if true flow was being implemented, and was hoping to find some knowledge that only highly experienced consultants could give from years spent at multiple sites.  This book disppointed me greatly in my expectations.  The way the authors deal with flow is on the surface at best.  They talk of taking timings, but don't give details on how to do it well (like leave the stopwatch running so as not to lose observations).  They fail to discuss movements of the operator that add to lack of flow.  Instead they focus on &quot;cells&quot; that are created where there are piles of WIP between stations.  Well, no kidding, they didn't get flow implemented.  The book leaves you with the feeling of not having really gotten the whole story, and wondering if this was just a Lean Enterprise attempt at getting you to buy the next book they can come up with meant to answer all unanswered questions.  <BR>Stick to Learning to See as far as I'm concerned and move on to other authors.	2003-04-21

It's presented in a question & answer format where he presents a question that is just about everyone's mind who conducts performance appraisals for employees, and he answers it with a short answer then a longer and more detailed answer.  The best line is when he says, \\"Supervisors put up with too much [stuff]otherwise writes very well and straightforward, and strongly pushed the responsibility for improvement back to the employee, not the manager.  Thank you for liberating me!  He spends a good deal of the book on performance planning as well, an often underutilized tool to set an employee up for success.	2002-10-22

I've been there and done that, but seeing some of the content first I realized there was more to it.  I have gotten several tips from the book that will help me a lot.  For example, having a file for a staff meeting to collect ideas of things to talk about for an agenda.  The only problem is that the book is very centered around filing and paper, and not enough on the electronic systems.  Everything mentioned with regards to paper files can be used on a computer as well, but I think this book needs yet another update to get into more details.

I tried the Meatloaf 101 recipe and I created one of the worst meatloafs you could imagine.  After putting vegetables into the food processor as directed I proceeded to run the processor for the time suggested.  What I found was that when I was done the vegetables had been way over processed.  I used them anyway thinking I may not understand what will come out, but the meatloaf was a mushy mess that was the consistency of dog food.  Be very cautious when using this cookbook, use your kitchen common sense.	2002-06-14

Reading that book changed my entire outlook on religion and Christianity.  I read several other books by Spong after that.  This book, a very early writing from him back in the early 70's, is certainly not up to the same caliber as his more current books.  Spong attempts to take apart the Lord's prayer section by section and try to explain what he really means when he says the words.  He does not take time to go into depth with his re-wordings, just briefly tells you what he thinks and expects you to believe it as well.   This is a recent printing of the book and I was very disappointed to see that one set of pages was printed upside down and backwards and that the last chapter was printed twice!  After taking so long to reprint the book you would think they would've taken the time to examine it for errors.   Overall, I think the book has some interesting basic concepts, but I would recommend reading Why Christianity Must Change or Die to get all of Spong's beliefs in a more concise format.	2001-04-17

The format is sort like a workbook which makes it a little easier to use and also great as a teaching tool.  What is lacking is more examples from a wide variety of industries from small to large so the reader can really understand how to apply the tool to their workplace.  There is also a lack of application to areas outside of manufacturing where I think VSM could be applied: product design process and administrative processes. Overall it seems to be a good book, but you'll need some backup material from the web to round our your education on the subject.	2001-02-09

I have used Dorian Shainin's statistical engineering techniques for years and have solved several tough problems in manufacturing environments.  I have found the techniques to be quite capable of helping me solve probably  99% of the problems I have faced in manufacturing.  Bhote's second edition  is a welcome update from his sparse first attempt.  This book shows  techniques, examples and how they work and don't work.  More and newer  tools are shown in this edition also.  I found it a little difficult to  read over and over again Keki's slamming of Taguchi and classical DOE.   Shainin has used these tools to develop his own tools, and while they  aren't used in his strategies by name they should at least be given polite  acknowlegement by the author.  I often felt as if Keki was begging the  reader to use Shainin's techniques instead of simply writing about them.    Overall I appreciate the compilation of almost all of Shainin's techniques  even though so many have service marks on them for protection.  This is a  wonderful reference book and I have found it very useful to use when I  explain the tools to others. I did have a hard time trying to merge the  message of six sigma with Shainin's statistical engineering.  I couldn't  figure out if Keki thought six sigma was right or wrong, but he then went  on to promote his own new version of everything, the Big Q.  A little too  much selling.	2000-05-14
