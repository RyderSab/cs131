The Occult Christ reveals this hidden wisdom and knowledge within Biblical Scripture and presents Christianity as a Modern Mystery School in the manner of the ancient traditions throughout the world.<br /><br />Within the Christ Mysteries is the cosmic effort to restore the experience of mysticism, power, and the Divine on a personal level. This path not only acknowledges the Divine Feminine within the Universe and the individual, but it also reveals the means to unfold it within your life. You are shown how to access great universal and Divine power through the sacred festivals of the changing of the seasons-times in which the veil between the physical and the spiritual is thinnest. The true Christ Mysteries open the angelic hierarchies to humanity and show the way to attune to them for greater self-knowledge, self-mastery, and self-realization.	2005-09-25

The main substance of the book consists of a series of chapters devoted to Germany's relations with the different European powers : Britain, France, Russia, Italy and Eastern Europe. The concluding chapter analyses Hitler's role in Germany's foreign policy before the Second World War, comparing and contrasting it with the foreign policy of the Weimar republic.<br /><br />Dr Hiden is not confined to a narrow diplomatic approach. He takes a balanced view of the period as a whole, paying as much attention to the Weimar as to the Nazi years. His treatment sets Germany in her full European context, but by separating her individual relationships he is able to clarify her complex role in this critical period. His book will be of interest to all those concerned with modern history, politics and international affairs.	2005-04-03

One of the distinguishing features of Jewish mysticism is its emphasis on the day-to-day relevance of the visionary experience. Dr. Hoffman elucidates how Kabbalistic ideas as well as Kabbalistic thinkers themselves have exerted a profound influence on the establishment and growth of Western psychological thought.<br /><br />Beginning with a historical evolution and presentation of Kabbalistic metaphysics and cosmology, the main thrust here is on the applicability of its teachings. Such topics as the Kabbalah's views on dreams, meditation, sexuality, community life, diet and health, and the role of human emotions in daily life are explored in detail.	2005-02-13

Treating bulimia poses a challenge to the therapist, who must consider how the interactions among sociocultural, individual, and family factors maintain the symptoms.<br /><br /> In this book beginning and experienced professionals will find a sensible and comprehensive approach to understanding and treating bulimia. This approach, based on principles of feminist family systems theory, has been proven successful in a clinical pro-gram devoted to the treatment of eating disorders.<br /><br /> The authors open with a discussion of the complex sociocultural, familial, and individual developmental factors that contribute to the development of bulimia. Family patterns related to eating disorders are traced through the family life-cycle and even through several generations.<br /><br /> Then the authors make a major conceptual contributionâ\\"their classification of bulimic families into &quot;perfect,&quot; &quot;overprotective,&quot; and &quot;chaotic&quot; types. The dynamics and treatment of each family type are illustrated in extensive case studies.<br /><br /> While the focus is on families, the authors recognize that the treatment of bulimia, be-cause of the complexity of the syndrome, must be multidimensional. Their comprehensive treatment program includes thorough assessment (with special attention given to substance abuse and the sexual abuse that many of these women have suffered), consultation (which may open the door to family therapy), individual, couples, and group therapies. The relationship of bulimia to affective disorders and the possible need for medication are also discussed.<br /><br /> Above all, this is a clinical book, packed with intervention strategies and case examples. It will be invaluable to all family therapists and health-care professionals working with bulimic clients.	2004-07-24

(1996, Citadel Press).<br />In the preface I find the author complaining about other books on witchcraft that:<br />&quot;Run counter to witchcraft ethics, such as death curses and spells to gain personal power&quot;<br />Why are most people really studying the occult... what do they want?<br />Peace and joy for all humanity - yes. But in the short term - a promotion, to escape a layoff, to find a lover, to get out of the ticket in traffic court. Personal power, we all want a greater control over our personal lives.<br />and then three pages later...<br />&quot;  There is no way in which one can summarize the beliefs of witches about the Goddess and her consort, for there is no orthodoxy in witchcraft. The names change from one group to another, and different groups emphasize different attributes of these powers. One can, however, easily state the central belief of all witches as regards human conduct. The Witches' Law, handed down through the generations, is &quot;Do what ye will an (meaning 'provided that') ye harm no-one.&quot; To this is added the statement of principle, &quot;Perfect Love, Perfect Trust&quot;. The law has also been expressed in the words &quot;Love and do harm to none&quot; and &quot;Love, and do what you will under the law of love&quot;. The Old Religion is, indeed, a religion of love. &quot;<br />Many pre-christian cultures where polytheistic, but not all where matrilineal, and although almost all matrarchical societies have been wiped out by judeo-christianity and islam, there is no concrete evidence that women are kinder and gentler leaders then men (see: Thatcher, Janet Reno, Dianne Feinstein, various english queens).<br />Then we get to the &quot;central belief of all witches&quot; after &quot;there is no orthodoxy in witchcraft&quot; - &quot;The Witches' Law&quot;.

Would you kill to protect your child, you mate, your best friend, you family?

The modern surfer on his small plastic board is the product of a fascinating history of development. Nat Young, one of the world's great surfers, has produced an illustrated history of the sport that is the most definitive and authoritative ever published.<br />This book is the result of a lifetime of involvement with surfing and a deep interest in its history. Nat has had discussions with the greats of the sport, from Duke Kahanmoku through to contemporary stars like Kelly Slater and Lisa Anderson. He tells for the first time the real story behind the remarkable development of what we see as modern surfing in California in the '40s.<br />Illustrating the book are rare reproductions of early Hawaiian and Australian surfing that have never before been published, and the work of the world's best surf photographers, gathered together in a volume for the first time; a feat remarkable even for a surfer of the authority of Nat Young.<br />He traces the paths of the development of the sport from the Hawaiian kings through to the cur-rent crop of professionals. Along the way are portraits of some of the remarkable figures that the sport has seen - and it is a field not short of its eccentric stars.	2003-12-30

Within this area of study there have been broadly two avenues of approach: the work of the plasma physicist (and related workers) and the work of the astrophysicist, who has been observing and interpreting similar phenomena in stars and nebulae.<br />Astrophysical analysis and interpretation (by spectroscopy) began with pioneering work upon hydrogen. This work was extended later into the study of many types of physical processes in highly ionized gases, including both radiative and collisional interactions with atoms other than hydrogen. These studies, which have hitherto appeared only in periodicals and have not been generally available, are now recognized as<br />basic to many areas of physics and geophysics, and their general theory is applicable to many problems other than those of nebulae.<br />Professor Menzel, one of the foremost contributors in this field, has selected 30 such papers with the assistance of Dr. L. H. Aller. They include a paper on the theory of hydrogenic spectra, and 18 papers upon the physical processes in gaseous nebulae, covering problems of radiation and radiative transfer, the Balmer decrement, electron temperatures, excitation, electron densities, spectrophotometry, statistical equilibrium of neutral helium, the abundance of 0 III, fluorescence in high-excitation planetaries, and the chemical composition of planetary nebulae. The third portion of the book is devoted to 10 papers on the interpretation of nebular spectra, covering electron velocity distribution, multiplet intensities, spectrophotometry, thermal effects, and various spectral analyses. The final paper is concerned with the intensities of &quot;forbidden&quot; spectral lines.	2002-11-11

The goal is to help students learn how to make the<br />kind of writing decisions that center on the need to prove analysis. Most students have substantial difficulties learning how to construct proof. If format and style<br />receive primary emphasis, the problem is compounded because the student is invited to mimic the customary appearance of a document, rather than to think through its<br />content and inner logic. Moreover, format comes easier to students who have already learned the dynamics of proof, and legal writing's heightened requirements of<br />style and grammar may be easier to accept when they are explained as ways of clarifying proof. And as a skill, style is much more valuable when rewriting second and<br />third drafts than in producing a first draft.<br />Part I of the text introduces students to the court and litigation systems, the structure and operation of rules of law, judicial opinions, and methods of briefing them.<br />Legal writing in general is introduced in Part II. Part III explains how to write an office memorandum; organize proof of a conclusion of law; use authority; analyze<br />facts; and use paragraphing, style, and citations. Part IV helps students with their first law school examinations. Part V introduces the advocacy skills of theory<br />development, argumentation, and accurate handling of procedural postures.

This book is for such vacationers: people who know nothing<br />about astronomy and have little interest in its scientific profundities, but want to know more about what they can see in the skies. With a minimum of technicalities,<br />'Robert Claiborne takes the reader into observational astronomy by easy stages-first with the naked eye, then with the simple optical aid of binoculars, and finally with<br />the more sophisticated assistance of small to medium-size telescopes.<br />He tells the stargazer what are the interesting and beautiful objects he can see, and when and where to look for them during the four good stargazing summer months,<br />starting in June with the Dipper and the Pole Star and describing the constellations, stars, planets, double stars, galaxies, star clusters, nebulae, and other wonders which<br />are the subtly shifting tenants of the summer night.<br />This lucid and exciting book not only tells how and where to find particular celestial objects, and explains what they really are, but imparts its astronomical information<br />in relation to the amateur's stargazing experience rather than as a part of cosmic theory. With this book in hand, the whole remarkable universe begins to open up to the<br />viewer. Especially valuable is Claiborne's thorough and practical advice on equipment, both binoculars and telescopes.

Yet the content of a large part of the eight hundred ancient<br />Hebrew and Aramaic manuscripts remains concealed from the general public.<br />In this remarkable book Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, authors of the best-seller Holy Blood, Holy Grail, reveal new material that places the Scrolls in the time of Jesus and offers nothing less than a new<br />account of Christianity and an alternative and highly significant version of much of the New Testament.<br />Working closely with Professor Robert Eisenman-one of the foremost experts in biblical archaeology and scholarship-and with other scholars in both America and Britain, Baigent and Leigh set out to discover<br />why the content of the Scrolls was kept secret for so long. Their investigation began in Israel, led to the corridors of the Vatican, and into the offices of the Inquisition. They encountered a rigidly held<br />\\"consensus\\" on interpretation and dating, and discovered just how fiercely orthodox biblical scholarship was prepared to fight to retain its monopoly on the materials and their interpretation.<br />But The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception is much more than an expose of a bitter struggle among scholars.

Singlehandedly he sabotaged Khrushchev's threatened Berlin show-down in 1961<br />and his information lay behind President Kennedy's successful defeat of the Soviet Cuban missile threat in October, 1962. Experts assess Penkovskiy's achievement as<br />the greatest intelligence coup of modern times.<br />Penkovskiy was neither a paid agent nor an ordinary defector. He was a single-minded zealot who hated the Soviet regime, because he feared Khrushchev was heading<br />on a collision course for nuclear war. Three times he made his way to western Europe, using official Soviet missions as a cover for his espionage activity; three times<br />he went back to Moscow to get priceless information for United States and British intelligence. The drama of his life puts fictional spy stories to shame.<br />Until now Penkovskiy's remarkable feat was a secret, locked in the intelligence files of three nations. THE PENKOVSKIY PAPERS, smuggled out to the West two<br />years ago, here tell his story. Written by Penkovskiy while he was living his amazing double-life, they comprise an unprecedented revelation of how totalitarian power<br />works, showing the grim hold which the secret police \\"intelligence\\" organs still maintain on Soviet society, more than a decade after the death of Stalin. Besides<br />detailing the surprising worldwide operations of Soviet intelligence, THE PENKOVSKIY PAPERS give an intimate portrayal of the men at the top of Soviet society and<br />their conflicting drives for power-all rendered by an observer so close to the center of Mocow's power that he might easily have become himself one of its prime<br />movers.<br />THE PENKOVSKIY PAPERS are also the self-portrait of a remarkable man, driven to the ultimate act of revolt against the Soviet regime by his despair over the<br />irresponsibility of Soviet leaders. Viewed in the light of those days in 1961 and 1962, when Khrushchev risked world war with his missile adventure in Cuba, THE<br />PENKOVSKIY PAPERS offer an extraordinary insight on what a narrow escape the West, and the world, really had.act of revolt against the Soviet regime by his despair over the<br />irresponsibility of Soviet leaders.

In the<br />beginning, politics was war, and war has always been a quintessentially male activity. War, in fact, has always created the greatest gender gap, with deeply rooted myths of Man as just Warrior and<br />Woman as Beautiful Soul serving to re-create and secure women's social position as noncombatants and men's identity as warriors.<br />In this brilliant, startlingly original inquiry, a distinguished political philosopher and feminist demonstrates that the old myths-flattering to both men and women-will not do. They are defied by the reality of female bellicosity and sacrificial male love, and undermined by ambiguous issues-from the role of women in combat, to the moral imperatives of just wars. Finding inadequate the very forms of war discourse, Elshtain shakes us loose from both the institutional language of international-relations and conventional military narrative to open her book to the culture of war as she and<br />her family experienced it in Colorado during and after the Second World War, thus creating a new genre of the woman's war story. Incorporating a vast range of materials, from history to cultural<br />anthropology, popular culture, and feminist theory, she then critiques standard political theory from Aristotle to the present and shows how that theory itself constructs a life of collective conflict. By attacking the roots of war in the myths of war, Elshtain lays open the promise of a radical reconstruction of our political order.	2002-01-02

Books	5	0	0	N	N	Essential reading to understand the revolts	Year of Fire, Year of Ash will stand for many years as a leading study of the brave uprising in 1976-77 by ten., of thousands of South Africa's young people - now known to the world as the Soweto Revolt.<br />This book - by an author who is both scholar and active socialist revolutionary - is important not just because of its careful documentation or lucid style, but for the depth and perceptiveness of its political<br />insights. Its central question is: To what extent can the Black Consciousness Movement provide a viable ideological platform for future revolutionary struggle? It is a question that no one concerned for the<br />future of South Africa can ignore.<br />Baruch Hirson's book goes far beyond a history of the Revolt itself - inspiring and exciting as his account of the uprising is. Part One outlines the whole history of education for Blacks in South Africa,<br />stressing the long record of student resistance and analysing carefully the emergence of the Black Consciousness Movement after 1969. Part Two turns to the history of the Revolt itself, including its<br />antecedents in 1973-75. In the course of so doing, it explodes several of the myths already current concerning the Revolt. It shows how it was the black working class, rather than the students, who set the pace<br />of renewed resistance in the 1970s. The book also demonstrates how the key Black Consciousness structures - SASO and BPC - had very little organisationally to do with the Revolt, while the African National<br />Congress's underground cells played quite a significant role after the uprising began. Perhaps the most significant section of the book is Part Three in which the author, from a socialist perspective, analyses<br />Black Consciousness as an ideology, and sets its ideas in the context of South African history since the Second World War.	2001-12-23

Is it a good sign to dream about fish or snakes, or are these worrying omens?<br />Nearly 600 of the most frequent and widely reported dreams are explained and analyzed in this wide-ranging dictionary. Some of them, such as boats and maps, were first recorded thousands of<br />years ago, but there are also meanings for dreams as up-to-date as cars and ice-cream. Keep a copy by your bed and look up your dreams before they fade.<br />Human beings spend about a third of their total lives asleep, so it is not surprising that the dreams that come to us during this period should be the subject of endless speculation. Sometimes they are<br />as vivid as anything we experience during our waking lives, at others we remember them only as a series of jumbled images of which we can make very little sense. In our dreams we can perform<br />impossible actions in a world in which time, space and the order of events are hopelessly confused, or we may be haunted by nameless horrors which wake us in terror. All too frequently, the most<br />trivial occurences or minor details of our daily lives will form the basis of substantial dreams.

That much is clear. But when it comes to our psychological traits-who we are and what we can become-few people would credit genes with a major role in human development. For most of this century, we have considered parents and the general environment to be the primary sculptors of personality, and have bestowed on them all the credit for our triumphs and the blame for our failures.<br />Now, in a book that will change forever the way we think about ourselves and our children, Peter B. Neubauer, M.D., Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at New York University, and his son Alexander Neubauer, right the balance in the nature-nurture debate. They show how our genes affect the way we react to the world, interact with it, and behave in many situations. The authors delineate the genetic roots of our personalities, even as they remain faithful to Freudian psychology.<br />Based on Peter Neubauer's fifty years of clinical practice as a psychoanalyst and researcher, and on studies of identical twins, Nature's Thumbprint explores the range of inborn inclinations upon which personality is later built: individual timetables of maturation; adaptation to the family and the environment; reasons why some children are more vulnerable to environmental obstacles than others; and why some parents are stymied by children who do not match their expectations, while others respond in positive ways. Sure to redefine thinking in psychiatry, psychology, and psychotherapy, Nature's Thumbprint will also give parents a new understanding of their children. It offers a hopeful message to us all, for only when we understand the biological as well as the psychological underpinnings of personality can we come to a genuine understanding of ourselves and our lives.	2001-11-11

Chapter 6 contains a demonstration of Maxwell's equations that is based on Coulomb's law<br />and on the Lorentz transformation and which is valid only for the case where the charges move at constant velocities.<br />Chapters 7 and 8 deal with the conventional approach to the magnetic fields associated with constant and with variable currents. Here, as elsewhere, references to<br />Chapter 6 may be disregarded.<br />Chapter 9 contains a discussion of magnetic materials that parallels, to a certain extent, that of Chapter 3 on dielectrics.<br />In Chapter 10, the Maxwell equation for the curl of B is rediscovered, without using relativity. This is followed by a discussion of the four Maxwell equations, as well<br />as of some of their more general implications. The point of view is different from that of Chapter 6, and there is essentially no repetition.<br />The last four chapters, 11 to 14, concern various applications of Maxwell's equations: plane waves in infinite media in Chapter 11, reflection and refraction in Chapter<br />12, guided waves in Chapter 13, and radiation in Chapter 14. The only three media considered in Chapters 11 and 12 are perfect dielectrics, good conductors, and<br />low-pressure ionized gases. Similarly, Chapter 13 is limited to the two simplest types of guided wave, namely the TEM mode in coaxial lines and the TE1,0 mode in<br />rectangular guides. Chapter 14 discusses electric and magnetic dipoles and quadrupoles, as well as the essential ideas concerning the half-wave antenna, antenna arrays,<br />and the reciprocity theorem.<br />For a basic and relatively simple course on electromagnetism, one could study only Chapters 2, 3 (less Sections 3.3, 3.4, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10), 4 (less Sections 4.4 and<br />4.5), 7, 8, 9 (less Section 9.3 but conserving the equation v - B = 0), and 10. For a rather advanced course, on the other hand, Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 could be<br />reviewed briefly using the summaries at the end of each chapter. One would then start with Chapter 6, and then go on to Chapter 10 and the following chapters. There<br />are, of course, many other possibilities.<br />In Chapter 12, Sections 12.3 and 12.7 could be dispensed with. They involve the application of Fresnel's equations to particular cases and are not essential for the<br />remaining chapters. Chapter 13 is instructive, both because of the insight it provides into the propagation of electromagnetic waves andbecause of its engineering<br />applications, but it is not required for understanding Chapter 14. Finally, Chapter 14 is based on Chapter 10 and on the first two sections of Chapter 11.ring <BR>applications, but it is not required for understanding Chapter 14.

Griffith. The art of the cinematographer has often been submerged beneath fashionable theories of director as auteur or the star system. The Art of the Cinematographer brings the importance of the cameraman into perspective, focusing on cinematography in the history of film and offering candid interviews with five great exponents of the art. This expanded edition covers both the evolution of cinematographic techniques and the many distinctive personalities and anecdotes which form the history of this pivotal area in filmmaking. 105 photographs, over 50 new to this edition, portray the cameraman at work. In the early days filmmakers really made films-cranking the camera, developing the negatives, turning the projector. the possibilities in film photography attracted early attention in the work of Edwin S. Porter (The Great Train Robbery, 1903) and Bitzer, who anticipated many, if not most, of the tricks and innovations which seem so new today. Among the many who figured decisively in the development of cinematography were Chaplin's cameraman Rollie Totheroh, Keaton's man Elgin Lessley, Fritz Lang's favorite Karl Freund (who later shot the &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; series), Slavko Vorkapich, Ray Rennahan from Technicolor, Gregg Toland (Citizen Kane), Leon Shamroy, Charles B. Lang, and others. These men worked anonymously most of their lives; only recently has cinematography become a popular field for critics, award-givers, and film credit buffs; this is one of the first and most informative books devoted to the subject. Five men who broke the anonymity barrier speak about their careers, which collectively encompass the entire era of American films to date: Arthur Miller, &quot;the Master&quot; (How Green Was My Valley, Anna and the King of Siam), recalls the early years, John Ford, Fritz Lang, Cecil B. DeMille. Hal Mohr (The Jazz Singer, The Front Page, Captain Blood) remembers violating patent laws to make films in 1910, and the strange effects in A Midsummer Night's Dream which won, him the 1935 Academy Award. Hal Rosson (The Wizard of Oz, Singin' in the Rain) former chief glamour photographer for MGM, defends the studio system. Lucien Ballard (The Wild Bunch, True Grit) says, &quot;You know, everybody talks about how little Easy Rider cost, and how much money it made. They should be upset that it cost as much as it did. I could- have made it in five days, and done it twice as good. You had amateurs doing it, and that's why it took four or five weeks.&quot; Conrad Hall (In Cold Blood, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) describes his years as a wildcat filmmaker and as a Disney: nature photographer. The quality common to each is his love for the business, and determination that cinematography will remain a sometimes invisible,'but always essential aspect in film. The Art of the Cinematographer provides a complete survey of that aspect.azz Singer, The Front Page, Captain Blood) remembers violating patent laws to make films in 1910, and the strange effects in A Midsummer Night's Dream which won, him the 1935 Academy Award.

Clearly and concisely, but  with the rich understanding and enthusiasm that come from long association with the theatre, it covers every step in the mounting of  a play, from the time the director selects a script to the moment the curtain goes up on opening night.<br />The Complete Play Production Handbook makes an ideal introduction to the world of the theatre; teachers especially, from  elementary school to college, will find it helpful in staging plays of every sort. At the same time, the handbook's thorough treatment,  broad coverage, and extensive appendixes (including a guide to suppliers of theatrical equipment and a glossary of technical terms)  make this an invaluable reference work for almost anyone involved in any capacity-director, actor, or stagecrew member-in the  hundreds of thousands of dramatic productions that are put on each year by little theatres, community theatres, and summerstock  companies.<br />This book provides specific, detailed answers to the many questions that trouble any group seeking to bring a play to life. It tells how  to read a play and understand the playwright's intentions; how the director and actors can invigorate the play through their handling  of dialogue, movement, and business; and how the arts of scene design, lighting design, costuming, and makeup can be meshed to  enhance the production. It also tells how to avoid the alltoo-common pitfalls of amateur productions: a play that is badly chosen,  either for the performers or for the audience; a play that is misinterpreted, or not interpreted at all; a play that is so obviously miscast  that the dramatic values are distorted; a play that is so badly staged that the action cannot be followed; a play that is ruined by poor  scenery, lighting, or costumes, or one that fails because the different members of the theatrical team have not agreed on a common  goal.<br />Here are the fundamentals of directing and acting lucidly explained, with line drawings and photographs of actual productions to  illustrate key concepts and techniques, from the composition of the stage picture by the director to the proper handling by the actor  of. crosses and turns.

More than 200 German prisoners of war jammed into the mess hall of their American POW camp. Before the  evening was over, one of them, Corporal Johannes Kunzeaccused of treason-would lie in a pool of his own blood, savagely beaten to death by his fellow  prisoners.<br />Within three months, five men present in the mess hall would be accused, tried, and sentenced to death for the murder of Johannes Kunze-a sentence carried  out in July, 1945, at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Here, for the first time, the remarkable true story behind these events is revealed: the stark conditions in the  POW camps; the tactics used by military intelligence to tempt informants and turn the prisoners against each other; the one-sided legal battle dominated by a  sharp young military prosecutor, Lieutenant Colonel Leon Jaworski (of future Watergate fame); and the passions and politics of war which insured that for  Kunze and his accused killers, there could be no mercy.<br />A powerful and controversial account of crime and punishment, EXTREME JUSTICE demonstrates how-beyond innocence or guilt-the search for justice can  be lost in the desire for blood-revenge.	2001-08-01

He saves money, invests wisely, carries medical and life insurance, subscribes to a retirement plan, draws up a will. For  normal living, all this is important.<br />But the preparation advocated in Esther Dickey's book is geared to a more elemental urge - the instinct for survival. Raising the warning voice that  emergency conditions can be expected to arise - from unemployment, sickness, strikes, civil strife, famine, or war - the author urges families to prepare now,  while there is still time, and tells us how. While touching on other aspects of survival preparation, Passport to Survival is predominantly concerned with  food preparation, preservation and storage. With over 100 recipes and a multitude of other hints, it shows how the principal foods recommended for a  survival diet-wheat, powdered milk, honey and salt may be used in normal times to provide experience for the cook and to supply the family with nourishing  and appetizing meals. As a bonus, those meals turn out to be considerably less expensive than the customary American diet. A book with such a grim premise might be expected to be somber in tone. Not so with Passport to Survival. Filled with creative, cheerful thinking, it reflects  the author's faith in the power of the human heart and will. Thus it is not only a reasoned warning of future difficulties but a ringing challenge to make  physical and spiritual preparations to surmount them. This combination will make the book appeal to perceptive people everywhere.	2001-07-28

While the emphasis therefore is on the  design aims of compiler projects and how they might be achieved, the practical details of compiler writing have not been overlooked and the background to much of  the text is the compiler work which has taken place in the Computer Science Department in the University of Strathclyde over the last few years.<br />The book should be suitable as a basis for an undergraduate course on compilers and has been used as such in the University of Strathclyde. It deals with the  implementation of block-structured languages such as ALGOL 60, PL/l, ALGOL 68, Pascal, or Ada and reference is made frequently to aspects of particular languages.  Algorithms are described in an actual programming language (ALGOL 68) but students not familiar with this particular language should not have difficulty following  them. The exercises at the end of each chapter are intended to stimulate the student to think more about how compilers are constructed; outline solutions to the exercises  in chapters 1-12 are given at the end of the book. Chapter 1 discusses the compilation process in general terms, as well as the relationship between high level programming languages and typical computers, while  Chapter 2 goes on to discuss the formal definition of programming languages. Chapter 3 covers lexical analysis and Chapters 4 and 5 are concerned with top-down and  bottom-up methods of syntax analysis. Chapter 6 describes how a context-free grammar can be used as a framework for the compiler actions and Chapter 7 deals with the overall design of compilers with  particular emphasis on the design of multi-pass compilers.<br />The structure of symbol tables and mode (or type) tables for languages with complex types is dealt with in Chapter 8, while Chapter 9 is concerned with local and global  storage allocation.

This book, which moves from the simplest to some of the most sophisticated IC devices, offers a comfortable understanding of the way these  devices really work. Using physical intuition rather than mathematics to tell the story, it also explains the application of these devices in both linear and digital circuits,  including semiconductor memories..<br />Assuming no prior knowledge of semiconductors, the book reviews major electrical and electronic concepts and examines in detail the PN junction diode, which is then  used as a key to understanding all other modern semiconductor devices. Important processes and circuits are discussed throughout the book, with emphasis on  commercially significant semiconductor products.<br />As the coverage is intended to be informative, not rigorous, the treatment keeps mathematics to an absolute minimum, stressing the basic physical mechanisms. Many  illustrations are used to illuminate key semiconductor principles and mechanisms.<br />The purpose of the book is to help practicing engineers and technicians at all levels, QA personnel, and nontechnical managers gain a thorough understanding of the  basic devices that make new semiconductor products possible. Consequently the book covers the fundamentals of all the major commercial diodes, including the zener,  avalanche, P-i-N, varactor, Schottky, and even the special high-conductance diodes. It also explains the bipolar transistor as a simple extension of the diode theory and  shows a novel way to evaluate output impedance under various circuit conditions. Additional material highlights the evolution of all the bipolar digital logic families,  examines significant improvements, and describes the newer 12L designs.<br />But that's not all. The book also covers Junction Field-Effect Transistors (JFETs) and presents an easy-to-grasp approach to the rapidly evolving Metal-Oxide  Semiconductor (MOS) transistor, which is the backbone of the current advances in semiconductor memories, calculators, and microprocessors. Finally, these new MOS  products are discussed with major emphasis on the rapidly developing RAM and nonvolatile semiconductor ROM products.<br />The central idea of this book is to explain the basic semiconductor mechanisms that take place within solid-state integrated circuits in an easy-to-understand, intuitive  way. This allows the reader to grasp the main ideas behind all the devices used in the new semiconductor products, from the many types of diodes to the bipolar  transistors, the JFETs, the MOSFETS, and the developments in technologies for microprocessors and semiconductor memories. Semiconductor technology continues to  move very fast; therefore, many new concepts and devices also have been briefly covered to provide a quick updating for the reader.<br />The explanations presented will aid both students, as a supplement to their texts, and many other people, who will find that this book assists them in attaining their  desired level of understanding. The essentials of this book were presented by the author to a group of field-application engineers for semiconductor products. These  people had worked with the application of ICs, and they were interested in learning more about the details of the inner workings. They were surprised to find that they  could actually obtain a useful, intuitive understanding of the basic operation of a transistor from this short book. Far too many people, both inside and outside the  electronics industry, find that they are using semiconductor products in their everyday lives and yet lack a basic understanding of how these products operate. This  book will make these products understandable and, therefore, more &quot;friendly.&quot;<br />To develop an intuitive understanding of semiconductors, we first establish a backgroundfor the solid state of matter in Chapter 1. For readers with a little knowledge  in chemistry and the physics of solids, this will be a refresher in concepts already understood. We have extended this material to introduce the notions of an electric  field and electric current. Crystals are introduced, and impurity doping of silicon is covered.<br />Chapter 2 builds on this physical framework and introduces the PN diode. All aspects of diode operation are covered, and many commercially significant diode  mechanisms are explained.<br />Chapter 3 provides insight into bipolar transistor operation and discusses both small-signal characteristics and large-signal limitations. Some new ways to visualize and understand both the common-emitter connection (with both  voltage and current drive) and the common-base connection are developed. These are used to provide an understanding of the output impedance for each of these  connections. A simple model for the transistor is introduced and an example shows how this can predict the voltage gain of a single-stage amplifier.<br />Chapter 4 provides a short history of the evolution of transistor manufacturing techniques.<br />Chapter 5 shows how integrated circuits are built and introduces linear IC processes and both NPN and special PNP devices. The evolution of digital IC logic circuits is  also highlighted, and the popular logic families are explained.<br />Chapter 6 provides insight into the junction field-effect transistor world. The basic operation of the JFET is covered along with the BiFETs, the new monolithic  operational amplifiers. The high-frequency MOSFET is also described in this chapter.<br />Chapter 7, the largest of the chapters, is devoted to the present workhorse of the semiconductor industry, the metal-oxide semiconductors, the MOSFETs. The advances  being made by semiconductor mem ory and microprocessor chips are shown to be a result of an evolution from the earlier PMOS products. A new intuitive  introduction to the operation of the MOS field-effect transistor is provided that allows an easy understanding of this complex device. The CMOS, DMOS, VMOS, and  new N-channel technologies are all discussed, and logic circuits are described.for the solid state of matter in Chapter 1.

To date, however, the  designers of diagnostic systems have generally been content to incorporate all the requisite knowledge within a single, homogenous structure and to opt for  a single mode of reasoning.<br />In this book the authors describe in detail the design and development of the CHECK project at the University of Turin which was undertaken in order to  show that it is possible to combine different kinds of knowledge structure and different modes of reasoning within a single system. Indeed, the authors  argue, diagnostic problems are, in general, so complex that only a system in which these different kinds of knowledge and different levels of reasoning  interact can hope to reproduce the complexity and subtlety of the human expert's thought processes. The book demonstrates that the authors' innovative  approach has many advantages, and the detailed description of their system will allow other researchers, working in a whole range of different domains, to  build upon their pioneering work.	2001-04-08

Many of the most important graphic artists have made use of the seemingly endless resources of the process, and currently there has been a considerable revival of interest in it.<br />Lithography is really not a difficult technique to use, and the equipment that one needs is minimal and not expensive. With the present volume, prepared by one of the foremost lithographic artists, a handy reader should be able to make entirely satisfactory prints. Mr. Arnold approaches lithography as an art medium, and while providing a detailed coverage that will anticipate all your problems, he takes you through each  stage of the process: selection and preparation of the stone, sealing and cleaning, preparing paper, constructing the press, the printing operation, process ing after printing. A special chapter is devoted to specific things that can go wrong. and shows you how to correct them.<br />Mr. Arnold covers many types and variations of lithography: direct drawing on the stone (pencil, tusche, dry brush, lithotint, mezzotint, etc.) and transfer techniques from other substances. Color printing is covered in quite a bit of detail, while the use of zinc and aluminum plates as an art form is also considered. Throughout the book the exposition is extremely clear and very concrete, revealing simple, modern techniques that are easily used.<br />While this book is primarily intended for the person who has never made a lithograph before, it provides such a wealth of detail (based upon years of practical experience) and conveys so much about modern understandings that even an experienced lithog. rapher is likely to learn much from it. This is an ideal guidebook for anyone inter ested in this art form.	2001-04-08
