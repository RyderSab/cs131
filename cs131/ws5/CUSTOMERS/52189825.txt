Carhart maintains that Pickett's charge was not Lee's only strategy, but was to be accompanied by a flank attack led by JEB Stuart's calvary, which was prevented from its execution by George Armstrong Custer. His idea is not that revolutionary - Sears hints of it in his recent Gettysburg history, but probably elicits some controversy among some historians (and reviewers here). Admittedly, I did not dissect this book like others, but just enjoyed it as a Civil War read.  <br /> <br />Carhart discusses military strategy of Hannibal, Alexander, and Napoleon, which surely would have been studied by Lee, and presents them as the basis for Lee's plans. He uses extensive citations from after action reports, diaries, letters and other sources to prove his case. <br /> <br />\\"Lost Triumph\\" is a quick read - although coming in at just under 300 pages, the type is nearly triple-spaced. I wish Carhart had compressed the type and used the extra space for more maps of the battle, of which there are only two. I found it very difficult to follow the detail without better and more maps. Otherwise, it's very interesting reading for Civil War buffs and those familiar with the battle. The book begins with a couple of Civil War introductory chapters, so even the casual reader might enjoy. <br />	2005-09-01

Mr. Welch has had several years to further articulate and refine his corporate management philosophies he introduced in \\"Straight from the Gut\\". Rather than using that the stream-of-consciousness narrative style, Welch provides a more organized presentation of modern management. He revisits differentiation, the \\"4 e's and 1 p\\" of hiring, candor, and \\"no surprises\\", and adds new material, including a self-proclaimed \\"do as I say not as I did\\" section on work-life balance. While some of his principles are universal across all business, the book is aimed at corporate managers. <br /> <br />Despite shallow rationalizations such as why corporate winning is good for everyone, and his musings as to whether he will see the Pearly Gates, the book is well worth the read for the target audience. Whatever one thinks of him personally, Welch was a hugely successful corporate manager with an apparent large capacity to teach. <br /> <br />I wish this book had been a supplementary textbook in my business school program. It is an excellent, pragmatic companion to management theory. <br />	2005-07-17

The book reminded me of \\"Confederates in the Attic\\", where another obsessed author traveled around historical Civil War sites chronicling the people and places he ran into.  <br /> <br />Part 1, which is the majority of the book, is an investigation into the Lincoln assassination, and while I did not learn anything new, I found it entertaining. Part 2 was a much shorter discussion on Garfield's assassination and Part 3 was an even shorter look at McKinley's death. All three provided a look at the assassins themselves and the latter parts frequently digressed well off of the subject at hand to discussions on cults, prime time soap operas, and the personal lives of her traveling companions. And as other reviewers here noted, the entire book is peppered with Vowell's political views.  <br /> <br />All of this, however, is benign and entertaining. Do not read \\"Assassination Vacation\\" looking for hardcore investigative journalism into the murders of three late 19th century presidents, but rather light-hearted non-fiction and casual color commentary by a young lady with historical curiosities, political opinions, and a dry sense of humor that will quickly grow on you. <br />	2005-07-02

He bypasses theory and verbose explanations and delivers advice in 5-8 page sections. The first part of each section provides the meat, accompanied by sidebars summing up the page's contents, and then followed questions and answers related to the topic. <br /> <br />I have been reading Whitten in \\"PM Network\\" and hearing him at local PMI chapter presentations and this book is a compilation of that material plus additional. The content is perfect for a seasoned project manager who has actual experience to reflect on as they consider Whitten's advice. <br /> <br />A strength of this book is also a weakness, thus only four stars above. While the book is easy to read and maintains a sharp focus, there is also a lot of white space, with large margins, and the constant summarizing and re-summarizing with sidebars and related Q&A does lead to some skimming.  <br /> <br />This is one of the few project management books I have ever read that would make a good audio book. With concise advice like \\"Are you too soft?\\", \\"Inspect what you expect\\", \\"Manage to your top three problems\\", and \\"Escalate is not a dirty word\\", his message is very effectively delivered, understood, and remembered. <br />	2005-02-20

I read \\"People of the Lie\\" in one sitting, which is something I rarely do. It was disturbing and fascinating as I read it, but seems uneven and flawed as I reflect on it.  <br /> <br />The book was too short; it requires more than 270 pages to support some of the claims he made, especially with his choice of case studies. I think he was too liberal with the term \\"evil\\". Most of the people in the case studies were just disgusting; identifying them as evil gives them too much credit. He did define \\"evil\\" much more broadly and banal than its common interpretation (i.e., using power or coercion -covert or overt - to limit spiritual growth). Yet then he proceeds to tie in this brand of evil with the Satanic, virtually invalidating his previous definition.  <br /> <br />I do appreciate the emphasis on parenting and how poor parenting can destroy lives; still there are much better treatments of the subject and really is worth much more coverage than it's given. <br /> <br />The chapter on Charlene was interesting but anti-climactic and lightweight. Surely, surely with all the bad people out there, he could have found a better case-study for a potential candidate for exorcism.  <br /> <br />His chapter on Mylai and the culpability of the Johnson administration and the America public in general was right on the money. Still, this chapter did not really address the dynamic of group evil, just rather the political situation behind a particular event. It was really a poor attempt of covering the subject, which really could have been its own book. <br /> <br />The book will help me to identify, fear, and be repulsed by the people of the lie, but it is by far not an exhaustive or complete analysis. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-25

Books	4	1	2	N	N	Authentic but dry	U.S. Grant's second volume of his memoirs provide a detailed but dry, unemotional history of his efforts in the Civil War prior to his taking control of the Army of the Potomac and the entire US Army. <br /> <br />We get the details on the actual \\"unconditional surrender\\" memo that made him famous, inside scoop on Halleck's jealousy and busting then reinstating Grant, why he was frustrated with Rosencrantz, and why the Rebels lost Chattanooga, but we don't get the man's inner thoughts. We don't get his feelings, his insecurities, his pontificating or reflecting on war and death. The text is virtually devoid of any feeling whatsoever. It is not until the last third of the book when Grant utters his first emotional thought on the carnage at Vicksburg: \\"While a battle is raging, one can see his enemy mowed down by the thousand, or then ten thousand, with great composure; but after the battle, these scenes are distressing and one is naturally disposed to do as much to alleviate the suffering of an enemy as a friend.\\" <br /> <br />This detachment is strange as Grant began writing this book shortly after being diagnosed with terminal throat cancer, so one would think he would have been extremely introspective and reflective at this time. <br /> <br />Finally, the reader should remember that Grant spent most of his Civil War career in the Western theatre of the war. So while you get first-hand account of operations in Tennessee and Mississippi, none of the book is devoted to the most publicized part of the war - the exploits of the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Northern Virginia. That's in Part 3. <br />	2004-11-25

Winik forced me to think of the war in a whole new light. <br /> <br />Winik has an excellent understanding of how the Civil War defined us as a nation. He shows how fragile we were at that time and how easily history could have taken an alternate path, much like similar situations of Afghanistan, Cambodia, Ireland, etc... Most Civil War curriculum leaves the reader thinking the war had a hard stop. I personally never realized how different attitudes from the various Confederate generals could have resulted in a guerilla effort that could have prolonged the rebellion even to this day. This turn of events has played out time and time again in history. <br /> <br />While the prose was enjoyable, I was sometimes put off with an element of his writing style where he would frequently take dives into minutiae that simply did not fit into the larger context. However, this is overshadowed by his command of the subject matter in both the historical context and the philosophical context. <br /> <br />For those wanting to understand the larger meaning of the war, this is one of the best books I have found. <br />	2004-09-22

Author Donald Phillips said he took Sandburg's Lincoln bio for leisure reading at a week long management seminar and realized Lincoln was the epitome of everything that was discussed. He says leadership is a nebulous and abstract set of guidelines that is difficult to learn without viewing it empirically through someone like Lincoln. <br /> <br />Phillips uses Lincoln's presidential years to demonstrate the virtues/techniques of MBWA, honesty and integrity, persuasion, courage, goal-setting, paradox, decisiveness, humility, and sense of humor. I only wish he could have drawn more from Lincoln's pre-presidential years as an example of how a leader is made. This is a short and easy-to-read book that should be a must for any study of leadership. <br />	2004-09-03

Not a Clinton-lover nor Clinton-hater, I could care less about Monica, Jennifer, inhaling, or Vietnam. I want a solid account of the history, policies, legislation, and interactions. Unfortunately, the abridged version is targeted toward the extreme factions, either trying to coddle the loyal fan or convince the detractor that his major faults were minor.      I don't need to hear about the vast right-wing conspiracy - I read \\"Bloodsport\\", saw Hilliary's \\"Today Show\\" interview, and witnessed Starr dig his own grave in real-time. Clinton was far less partisan than Daschle's \\"Like No Other Time\\", but this reading seemed to just focus on the sensationalist crap, to the detriment of Bosnia, Somalia, policy decisions, the economy, etc.. Other than the Monica-scandal, he never really admits to any mistakes, but rather makes excuses. He had many successes along with his failures in his two terms and would have done us - and himself - much better if he would have been honest and open about both.       So, my dilemma is, how much does the abridged version represent the entire book? Should I spend the precious time reading Blumenthal's or Rubin's version of his presidency instead?	2004-07-24

The book really brings home what happened apart from the battlefront. As revered as President Lincoln is today, he made some decisions that would make 21st century citizens of a democracy cringe. Alternatively, Lincoln's detractors and political opponents did the same. It seems unfathomable to me now that Lincoln could have been hated by so many, and this book really pierces the veil of the myth surrounding his presidency and the unity of all those in the Union.<br />When one really ponders what Lincoln did - suspending the writ of habeas corpus, prosecuting publishers printing unfavorable information, trading with South, etc. - one realizes that Lincoln - just like everyone - is neither complete hero nor complete villain - but a convoluted mix of gray areas. <br />But a reflection on Lincoln is not an intended objective of this book. Nor does it foster an argument that Lincoln deserved death. The focus here is the plot to de-throne Lincoln and make peace with the South, hatched by shadowy Confederate sympathizers, fringe Confederate spies, the European aristocracy, and some out-and-out crazies, like the chief villain George Sanders and assassian John Wilkes Booth. This objective is fulfilled in excruciating detail.<br />Also deeply disturbing was the revelation of the \\"Young Americans\\" Hitler-youth-type organization, the assertion that Stephen Douglas planned for a military coup d'etat over Lincoln, and the whole affair between Confederate exiles conspiring with British/Canadians to incite war with England.<br />A fascinating story is marred by the author's continuous barrage of trivial details. He throws so many names, places, and things at the reader that even the most astute Civil War scholar would be overwhelmed.<br />The book reads like a novel and while that is good for easy reading, one has to wonder how the author dug up so much granular information 150 years later.  The source notes - a paltry half-dozen pages at the end - do nothing to convince me that the author did in fact thoroughly validate the accuracy of his assertions. Personally, while I think the book does contain many facts, I have to consider it more a historical novel, like Gore Vidal's \\"Lincoln\\", than a history. \\"Dark Union\\", another recent and similar book on Lincoln during the war, is much better annotated.	2004-07-18

Less than a quarter of the book describes the battle itself; the majority of it describes the context of the battle - the campaigns leading up to Antietam, Lincoln's behind-the-scenes strategies, the politics and public opinion in both North and South, the personalities, the deliberations in France and Europe as to whether or not to recognize the Confederacy, the Emancipation Proclamation, and why the battle was a turning point in the war.<br />If primarily looking for battle maneuvers and strategies, &quot;box scores&quot; for the generals, and first-hand descriptions of the excitement and horrors of one of the bloodiest battles in American history, &quot;Crossroads to Freedom&quot; will at best whet the appetite. If looking for a concise and comprehensive look at the battle, &quot;Crossroads to Freedom&quot; is a good choice.	2004-07-03

A good half or more was really an LBJ biography that offered new information not found in similar works I have read. This bio provided some very unflattering data on LBJ that -  unfortunately - I really feel is more-or-less accurate. As far as the assertions that LBJ and Edward Clark had JFK assassinated, well that evidence is inconclusive. The assertions that LBJ (and Clark) committed some despicable acts are very arguable, but to advance beyond the other garden-variety conspiracy theories of Kennedy's assassination, the author needs to formulate a better case. The author readily admitted to the use of &quot;faction&quot; in this last chapter or so, but I feel he used that technique well before then. He includes almost 100 pages of photocopied evidence in the book's appendix, but while it may legitimately show LBJ as a dishonest, power-hungry, and pathological man, it falls far short of implicating him in JFK's assassination.<br />For McClellan to have presented this book as an unflattering LBJ bio and suggested possible involvement in the assassination is one thing, but for him to offer this as definitive proof, &quot;Blood...&quot; fails. For a look at the seamier side of LBJ, and the indictment of legal abuse of the state judicial system, it's a good read.	2004-06-27

They are correct, but Bronson is very clear in his introduction that he has no experience in this area. As he says at one point in the book after comparing this project to a box of confections that everyone wants to try, he is &quot;NOT XRAYING THE CHOCOLATES&quot;.<br />Instead he says he writes of people who are being honest with themselves in answering the question, in most cases with his prompting and interaction. He intertwines his own experiences in all the stories such that he too answers the question as well through the course of the book.<br />Each interviewee generally is given their own 4-5 page section, so the book seems to read fast. Sometimes the sections are too concise and disjointed and other times the sections provide just enough information to communicate a message.<br />What a fantastic project this must have been for him. While for the reader there are no real pearls of wisdon, it makes one reflect, and and it is very enjoyable to read.	2004-06-20

This book provides an extended view of Nixon in the last four years of his life.<br />A few of the reviewers here questioned whether Crowley's writings accurately recount Nixon's comments and confessions in an objective manner, and they wonder if he would have really opened up to her... My first take on this was a once powerful, now-fallen, guilt-ridden old man hires an attractive twenty-something female grad student - someone naïve and susceptible he can impress and dominate - to rewrite his legacy, gloss over his mistakes, and show how even after all that happened, he was indeed great. Did she - at this time in her life - have the necessary knowledge, historical context and maturity to discerningly ferret out, deduce and capture the real truth from Nixon's rhetoric?<br />Soon into the book, I began to realize these worries were moot, as conversations recounted by Crowley show the familiar arrogance, criticisms, paranoia, self-absorbtion and the meddling that are indeed vintage Nixon.<br />Nixon's musings on the collapse of Communism, Gorbachev, and Yeltsin were very interesting and provided a good review of a monumental set of events of world history. In fact, the first half of the book was a play-by-play of early 90s American-Soviet foreign policy with color commentary by Richard Nixon. So much so it became droll and I find myself skimming along to the sections on Vietnam and Watergate.<br />Part 3 focused on Nixon's reflections on Watergate. Crowley captures the range of feelings that must have plagued Nixon over his final 20 years - admission of culpability interchanged with minimization of his role and his being a victim of a liberal media and a turbulent time in history. He makes the point that his escapades were politics-as-usual and FDR, JFK, and LBJ all used the same dirty tricks he did. Crowley also captures Nixon's pleasure of seeing Clinton go through the same torture with Whitewater as he did with Watergate.<br />Part 4 continues commentary from Nixon on political scandal de jour and Part 5 focuses on Nixon's thoughts on philosophy, family and faith. On this last part, I wasn't particularly prepared to visualize Nixon puttering around the house in his pajamas talking about these things, but one realizes that he too was, in fact, human.<br />The book was not chronological, as each part recounted relevant items to the subject from Crowley's four years with him, which made it a bit difficult to follow on occasion. For the most part, beyond being &quot;linearly-challenged&quot; and the early preoccupation with Russian events, &quot;Nixon in Winter&quot; was fairly enjoyable.	2004-06-09

This view of Nixon reveals a despicable man, doing whatever he could do to discredit his opponents, manipulate whoever he could, lie, and cheat to get elected. Hard-working, brilliant, but disgusting. Nixon even tried to undermine peace attempts in Vietnam just before the 1968 election. All that said, the incumbent president wasn't much better, as those peace attempts were really lies propagated by the LBJ administration to influence the election in Humphrey's favor. The 1968 campaign was absolutely horrid and unforgivable. What was different between Nixon and LBJ is Nixon's paranoia and vindictiveness.<br />It's interesting how Ike never really endorses Nixon, even when his grandson married Nixon's daughter. Finally, from his hospital bed Ike endorses him before the 1968 election, but even then it was lukewarm. Ambrose - who wrote an Eisenhower biography as well - contrasted the two. He says Ike loved life and loved people, while Nixon was distrustful of people, and gave in to hate. Ike brought people together; Nixon tore people apart. Ambrose cites a diary entry from Ike's secretary during Ike's administration: &quot;The Vice President [Nixon] seems more like someone acting like a nice man more than a nice man&quot;.<br />The author commented how much different the Nixon administration may have been had Nixon had his first choice - Bob Finch, a genuine nice person - as his running mate. As it was Nixon surrounded himself with clones, all vindictive and paranoid. All fed his paranoia and anger and goaded his wrath. Their daily orders - delivered via comments in the margins of Nixon's daily news summaries - were very telling (and extremely interesting).<br />Nixon's foreign policy accomplishments - the settlement with North Vietnam, the opening to China and détente with the Russians - were indeed exceptional. But could these events have happened sooner had Nixon not circumvented his own State department in order to increase the histrionics and guarantee the credit for himself? Also, regarding the China and Russian initiatives, the author poses an interesting rhetorical question - who could have done it but Nixon, since he did not have to deal with a Nixon critic!<br />This is the middle book of a Nixon trilogy, so you don't get the childhood and Congressional years, or &quot;Nixon in winter&quot;, but you get to know the man, and it is depressing.	2004-05-20

Unlike other software engineering overviews, he does not assume that his audience is sold on process in general, so he spends some time arguing and presenting facts and stats to support structured project management and software development.<br />The author presents most of the integral concepts of the discipline and maintains a companion website with templates and checklists. He shares his experience on what development managers should expect from their developers, testers, corporate culture and customers. I read SPSG when it first came out and recently completed it again for a refresh. Although the book is now six years old, the material is still relevant because of the level at which it is presented, even in today's landscape of customized COTS and web services applications.<br />It gets four stars rather than five because in the last third of the book he takes arbitrary dives into detail before he exhausts the breadth of the subject. For instance, he only once refers in passing to regression-testing and never mentions the concept of SDLC environments, yet offers up formulas for estimating defects using pooling and seeding. Chapters seem to get shorter as if he was in a hurry to finish. As SPSG is relatively short at 250 pages, it seems the author could have easily included another 50 pages to hit those missed topics at a high-level. <br />SPSG is great for the new manager but is less useful for the experienced manager or as a reference. Fortunately, he includes an annotated bibliography on resources that provide more detail.	2004-04-29

If you liked the memoirs of Walter Cronkite, David Brinkley, and Dan Rather, so too will you like CBS News and &quot;Face the Nation&quot; veteran Bob Schieffer's &quot;This Just In&quot;. It is chocked full of historical anecdotes of national issues, national politics and TV news gossip.<br />Like the other reporters mentioned, while maybe they themselves are not worthy of a memoir, the sheer volume of historical events they witnessed is.<br />Schieffer's style is entertaining, homespun, honest, reflective and intelligent, and he has most definitely kept his ego in check. Schieffer shares his experiences during JFK's assassination, LBJ, Vietnam, Nixon, Carter, the 2000 election, and Sept 11. I would estimate the book is 75% insight to Washington and national events and 25% insight into the author and CBS News.<br />Schieffer provides enough personal information and history for his audience to get to know him, but that is less for grandstanding than for helping his audience to understand his background in order to understand how he interprets events.

It chronicles his journey through the dangerous jungles of Vietnam and through the dangerous jungles of Washington, DC, and his conversion from hawk to dove. He effortlessly carries the reader through his tenure under Robert McNamera, walking point on the ground in Vietnam, his RAND consulting career, life on the lamb, and courtroom battles with the Nixon administration which bleed into the Watergate scene.<br />Through his discussion of the contents of the 4000 pages of the Pentagon Papers, he systematically refutes the Cold War \\"domino theory\\" that the last five presidents had succumbed to. He exposes the governments' entire Vietnam strategy as one of ideological rhetoric, misunderstanding, and miscalculation.<br />While an exciting page-turner, it is also a depressing/disturbing book based on what it reveals about the Executive branch. Regardless of one's politics, the reader forever will look differently at how his government handles and reacts to foreign wars and agression.	2004-03-22

Did anyone realize there was a second scholarly biography of Truman published in the 90s?  Ferrell presents a different Harry Truman than David McCullough. His Truman is less romantic and less the accidental president. Where McCullough seems to put Truman on a pedestal, Ferrell presents a more realistic view. McCullough captures much of Truman's day-to-day thoughts and actions through his letters to Bess and Margaret, which obviously provides much greater insight into the President's personality, while Ferrell captured them through the comments and diaries of staff and contemporaries. While still portraying him as an honest and very capable (and underrated) president, he does not shy away from discussing his missteps and weaknesses.<br />I think a perfect example of the juxtaposition of the two authors is how each describes how the Marshall Plan got its name. McCullough says Truman wanted to give General Marshall credit for his ideas; Ferrell says Truman knew a bill called the \\"Truman Plan\\" would never make it past the Republicans in Congress. Both statements are probably true, but each author has a different emphasis. <br />Ferrell provides good analysis on world and national events happening around Truman with some interesting digressions and observations, such as with Stalin, Korea and its aftermath, McArthur, etc.. In fact, it becomes more of a history book than a biography of Truman. Because of this emphasis, the reader does not discover the real Truman, what drove him, his intimate thoughts and fears, etc. Bess, Margaret, and Mama Truman are bit players in this bio, although there were core to Truman.<br />Truman's 1948 election win was indeed result of a miraculous 11th hour great burst of energy by the incumbent president, but Ferrell does not shrink from showing Truman as the typical politician, slinging a little mud and showing partisanship against the 80th Congress, which he lambasted publicly and complemented privately (they passed the \\"Truman doctrine\\" and were as good with New Deal legislation as their predecessors and successors).<br />Despite his reserved countenance and mousy presentation, Truman was his own man. He stood up to Pendergast, FDR, labor, big business, domineering cabinet members, and  McArthur. He was the true moderate ... while busting the miners and railroad union strikes, threatening to draft them to stop the strike, he also fought \\"Big Steel\\" and vetoed Taft-Hartley. Ferrell sets straight Truman's record on civil rights giving it the credit it never really received. Truman was the true vote-your-conscience legislator. Ferrell closes with the last couple of years of the second administration, which were ripe with scandal, although not the result of improprieties from Truman himself.<br />If one can only read one Truman bio (and has the time to digest), read McCullough's tome. That author obviously reveres Truman, but is still a balanced account, and is more comprehensive and personal. That recommendation does not, however, discredit Ferrell, especially if one is more interested in the United States under Harry Truman than Truman the man.	2004-02-13

I found myself constantly supplementing it's information with extended sessions in the bookstore and on the web. There are even some subjects that this &quot;complete guide&quot; does not even touch on (e..g remote desktop). Get another book, probably any book, for an XP reference.<br />That said, there are about 200 pages in the middle of the book that make the purchase worthwhile. Part IV: Anatomy gives an excellent presentation of XP architecture, the Registry and file system. Buy it for this section.	2004-01-03
US	52189825	R30A7EVZ3LP6DE	0671798871	680068737	Truman	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Subject, Biographer and Narrator at their best	At 1000 pages, the book was a little daunting, so I chose the abridged audio cassettes. David McCullough - renowned historian and narrator for Burns' &quot;The Civil War&quot; - wrote and narrated this audio book and did a splendid job.<br />Truman, possibly the last &quot;common man&quot; president, lived an uncommon life with uncommon courage and accomplishments. He did not want to be vice-president or president, yet answered the calling. On one controversial issue where Truman was taking the high road, an aide commented that &quot;he would rather be right than president&quot;. He responded that &quot;he would rather be anything than president&quot;. How intimidating it must have been to take the reigns from FDR, especially since he had been virtually ignored as vice-president, yet Truman stood up to the test.<br />Through all of his successes, he never forgot who he was or compromised his principles. He stood up to Pendergrass when given his first government post, and his integrity never wavered through the Senate and presidency. He truly realized &quot;the buck stops here&quot; and never eschewed making the big decisions or taking responsibility for them.<br />He remained devoted to his wife, daughter, family and friends. McCullough cites numerous letters to wife Bess and daughter Margaret that provide great insight into the man. With strong self-confidence and no ego to nurse, he surrounded himself with brilliant and loyal men - Marshall, Bradley, Acheson, etc. - which helped him succeed in a crucial and trying time. Despite being surrounded by greatness and powerful people, he was not imtimidated by them, as evidenced by his handling of McArthur and Pendergrass.<br />As much as I enjoyed this audiobook and McCullough's narration, it was much too short, so I guess I better purchase the book after all!	2003-12-28

Truman: A Journey to Independence	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Valid tribute, but pales as a bio	I listened to these tapes just after finishing McCullough's Truman bio. I felt it was a rehash of the highlights of that work, sensationalized by mixed narration of Lauren Bacall, Gregory Peck, and Jack Lemmon, except with a little more of an additional focus on Margaret than McCullough's book. It did not cover much of Truman's life before or after the presidency. &quot;A Journey to Independence&quot; was a tribute and should be judged as such, rather than a bio. It's a passable listen, but I certainly would not recommend hunting down a copy.	2003-12-28

I found Daschle to be a very engaging writer and really appreciated his up-close insight over what were intriguing yet distant news stories for me.<br />Unfortunately, Daschle's highly partisan opinions (e.g., Republicans are bad, Democrats are good) offset some very good reporting and commentary. I almost quit the book after the first few chapters. No doubt Republicans dealt him some underhanded blows, but responding with the same black-and-white mentality does not help his own credibility.<br />Some of &quot;Like No Other Time&quot;, specifically the terrorist attacks, indeed describes heretofore extremely unique events that could make for interesting reading years from now. However, much of the events described in &quot;Like No Other Time&quot; is definitely like every other time in Washington, and while interesting now, probably won't sustain the book through multiple printings.<br />I like this book and, after completing it, like Tom Daschle, but &quot;Like No Other Time&quot; is really more of a serial magazine interview/article rather than history book.	2003-12-19

Bolton's premise is that our communication patterns are inherently faulty and he urges the reader adopt his framework to remedy. He presents - in order - listening skills, assertion skills, conflict-resolution skills, and collaborative problem solving skills, with each building upon the others. He blends keen insight into human nature, concepts of psychology and basic Judeo-Christian values into what appears to be a very effective methodology. The skills seem obvious, but in practice are rarely used, and in fact are rather uncomfortable when trying to start using.<br />I found Bolton's framework very valuable and thus far see its application can profoundly improve my own people skills in both a business and parental setting. Unfortunately, like most books of this type, the text is extremely verbose. Bolton possesses a style that is much less dry and wordy than many of his peers - in fact, I find it difficult to finish most of these types of books - but the ideas plus examples could have been distilled down to one-half the length of the 300 pages. The text is also very well referenced and footnoted, but - as a lay reader - I think the constant crediting other psychologists and philosophers confuse and muddy the message. This could be a book that one could return to periodically to refresh their skills, but its length will prevent the less diligent. I found myself taking detailed notes on each chapter for later referral; while a testament to the material, I wish the author had made it easier to digest.	2003-12-14

The description of the occupation is very insightful, describing how the Jewish community gradually lost more and more human rights and then was finally deported. The community refused to fathom that the Germans could be so cruel and that such persecution and genocide could happen in the 20th century, so they kept accepting each demotion, believing - hoping - the persecution could go no further. No doubt this pattern occurred time and time again in 1930s/40s Europe.<br />The description of camp life was gut-wrenching, yet told in a very detached manner. I found the narrative less disturbing than other Holocaust literature (although just as poignant), probably due both to the author's writing style and condensed nature of the tale.<br />I am anxious to complete Wiesel's &quot;Night Trilogy&quot; and read more of his writings.	2003-12-09

I liked the portrait of Churchill; having recently struggled through the first Manchester volumn, it was refreshing to jump to his war years where he became famous on the world stage, and to see how his childhood affected his adult years. FDR comes across as the politician's politician, equally adept at handling Churchill and Stalin, Eleanor, and the American public. Meacham scours many disparate sources to compile and organize the thoughts and motivations of both leaders.<br />Via Churchill's and FDR's interactions, the book chronicles Great Britain's last dance as a world power and its handing of the baton to the USA.	2003-11-25

It did provide some good info, but this work is over four years old, an eternity in technology. It certainly did not reflect Sun's rapid decline in market cap and Linux debacles, both of which landed it on the front page of the WSJ a few weeks ago.<br />I might have rated this four stars a few years ago.

It reminded me somewhat of some the characters in &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; - and, in fact, the books do overlap in their discussion of the post-War icons of scientific academia.<br />For those of us who grew up in the industry on the IBM side of things, ENIAC chronicles another force in computer history - the Sperry-Rand dynasty, which today is manifested as Unisys, now a struggling niche mainframe vendor trying to reinvent itself with an industrial-class Windows box.<br />The latter part of the book focuses on the subterfuge and betrayal visited upon the book's protagonists - Mauchly and Eckert. At first this read like general conspiracy theory stuff, but upon further reflection of my own professional life, where I have seen what some people will do to advance their careers or even qualify for an exam, I realized the story is certainly probable. Von Neumann, Atanasoff, and Brainerd come off as despicable characters, successful in their own right but with reputations forever marred due to their treachery. Mauchly and Eckert's lack of business prowess prevented them from recovering from their detractors' attacks.<br />In the long run, the injustice done to the duo did further the computer industry by opening up competition, although one can argue that IBM - the juggernaut of the industry - should have been the sole focus of the courts rather than Sperry-Rand.<br />The book is a quick-read, well-researched, and well-documented. I was hoping it would have been slightly more technical, but all-in-all a good read.	2003-10-26

Those with only a passing interest in the battle should rent the movie or read the Shaara historical fiction. This book describes the battle in DETAIL. It was meticulously researched and reconstructed from the disparate histories and correspondences of those involved in the battle, both civilian and military on both sides. Sears also pulls in all historical context as well, mentioning Lincoln's political situation and international issues where appropriate. I was, however, slightly disappointed that he did not do a more comprehensive job of discussing Gettysburg in relation to the entire history of the war.<br />I found this telling to have a more matter-of-fact style than Sears &quot;Landscape Turned Red&quot;. I remember that chronicling of Antietam to read more like a novel than &quot;Gettysburg&quot;.<br />I found the politics in the top echelon of the Confederate army very interesting; one does not usually learn of this when hearing of Lee and his generals, as history usually paints Lee as a near omnipotent leader. One has to wonder how the battle would have turned out had Stuart shown up on time to provide intelligence and Lee had taken Longstreet's suggestions. I also found the treatment of Meade interesting too, as history typically paints all Union generals prior to Grant as inept and weak.<br />Gettysburg plays on the magnificence of battle, and talks of generals and their actions much like we discuss football coaches and teams today; however, like any respectable Civil War book, it acknowledges the carnage, the death and suffering of men and horses, and how horrible a thing war is.	2003-10-17

McMaster writes that Vietnam was not lost in the battlefield or on the college campuses, but in Washington, D.C.. That about sums it up. The book's characters were Pathetic - all of them: LBJ, McNamera, the Bundy's, Wheeler, the Joint Chiefs. Greed, ego, arrogance and incompetence. This book tells it like it is and pulls no punches, unlike McNamera's own explanation in \\"In Retrospect\\".<br />This is LBJ at his worst: deceptive, underhanded and foolish. His bullying and subterfuge are forgiven by history in his domestic policy triumphs, i.e., the end justifies the means; but not with Vietnam, for it ended in debacle. As good as Johnson was at his tactics, he was out of his league in the area of foreign policy. Especially in the Eastern arena. While apparently nonpareil in sizing up the motivations and weaknesses of his peers and constituents, he did not have the gift across cultures. And he received absolutely no assistance from McNamera who was equally clueless in this area ... and equally as deceptive and self-absorbed.<br />It's a comedy of errors. The DC clique of LBJ, McNamera, Taylor and the Bundy brothers listened only to the advice they wanted to hear. Everyone else was considered extreme. It was interesting to see Taylor change his tune once he replaced Lodge in Saigon, and then how the DC clique even failed to listen to one of their own. <br />LBJ no doubt justified his actions by convincing himself of the need to protect Great Society legislation, but anyone who has studied LBJ knows that his zeal for the Great Society was more about establishing a place for himself in history than a real care for the downtrodden. This tale is also an excellent example of how tough it is to prosecute a war in a democracy, when the commander-in-chief is faced with soul-searching alternatives of protecting his stay in power vs. protecting the lives of his subjects.<br />Good book and good research. This was my second time through. I can understand how this might be dry if oneisn't real interested in the subject. And it's not a comprehensive treatment of Vietnam, but rather the political mess that got us there.	2003-09-13

The author took a fringe conjecture on the life of Christ and spun off a wonderful tale of suspense and international intrigue.<br />While I was completely absorbed by the backdrop of this story - theology, history, cryptology, Da Vinci's eccentricity, scheming Vatican, and secret societies - the foreground of this story was Good, but, in the end, wound up too neatly to be Great. It was as self-contained as a weekly TV drama series.<br />Regardless, I highly recommend for anyone enjoying history of modern religions, conspiracy theory, and in need of escape.	2003-09-08

Aside from back and forth chronology that confused me at times, I found the book to be well-written. However, I don't know that the material is worthy of a book. The entire volume is really summed up in one sentence: Life at Bell Labs was like academia until after the divestiture, and then no one at either Bell Labs, AT&amp;T, the RBOCs, or Lucent really knew how to harness its energy. As somewhat of an industry insider, I was hoping for more details of its products and innovations, but such information was hit-and-miss -- the author talked about &quot;MapsOnUs&quot; in detail, but quickly blew over other products like VoIP and Softswitch.	2003-09-06

I listened to the cassette versions of \\"Taking Charge\\" and \\"Reaching for Glory\\" when they first appeared. I listened to \\"Reaching for Glory\\" again after two LBJ bios and LBJ does indeed come alive. LBJ was, in the words of Robert Dalleck, a flawed giant. So many contradictions, so much hypocrisy - but yet - not... he was just LBJ. <br />The tape system which proved to be Nixon's downfall was also used by LBJ and JFK. Luckily for us 40 years later, we have wonderful insight into LBJ and the operation of his administration. The cassette versions are abridged, but getting to hear the actual recordings is fantastic. I anxiously await the third volume of the trilogy.	2003-09-05

Was it guilt that drove McNamera to write this or the selfish desire to dilute his share of the blame in the Vietnam debacle? Despite his claim to the contrary in the preface, I think it was mostly the latter. I don't think his arrogance would allow him to do any less. While many are guilty of arrogance, McNamera's indirectly led to the deaths of thousands.<br />While an extremely intelligent man, he had no business deciding defense or foreign policy issues. He should have stayed in the business world and now be writing commentaries on operations and organizational management. Maybe as a secretary of defense to Kennedy, he may have provided some value, since Kennedy was astute in world affairs and maybe McNamera provided some balance; but as a secretary to LBJ, it was the blind leading the blind and a prescription for disaster.<br />One interesting comment in the book is the assertion that JFK would have never allowed the Vietnam fiasco to happen. I cautiously agree to some extent, and not because I fall prey to the mythic JFK legend, but because foreign policy was his forte, while domestic policy was LBJ's. JFK was an independent thinker in this arena, and he would have led McNamera, Bundy, et al., rather then been influenced by them. (BTW, Alan Schwartz has a new, different take on LBJ's foreign policy prowess in \\"LBJ and Europe\\").<br />To his credit, McNamera does not shift blame, just dilutes it. For a more telling version of this whole mess, read McMasters' &quot;Dereliction of Duty&quot;. Many think McNamera guilty of war crimes, and while I think that is excessive, I certainly do not think he deserved the Medal of Freedom or the privilege of profiting from his \\"memoirs\\". He has a few new books out -- I think I will pass.	2003-09-02

He's highly disciplined in a manner I can scarcely imagine and he regularly engages and overcomes adversity. He is an inspiration to all and especially to those in the throngs of cancer.<br />What does not work is this underlying pretense epitomized with the book's title.

Of course, he is no different from any other successful athlete, businessman, or president... Such success requires an intense, self-absorbed focus.<br />I recommend this book for the inspirational value, but be prepared for the surface sentiments and contradictions.	2003-08-28

While Dalleck and Caro described LBJ's early years through his Congressional service in one and two volumes respectively, Kearns summarized his entire pre-presidential career in a little over one hundred pages. While her one volume tried to span his entire life like Unger's, it left out some very important milestones.<br />Kearns was too close to LBJ, both in terms of her personal contact and in terms of her historical perspective, for a true bio (note I had the 70s edition and there is a second 1991 edition). Although she dutifully recorded his thoughts and reminiscing of his career, and while in many cases, she corroborated his words with evidence, she seemed to introduce little other third party data from any research she might have done. And despite the coverage of the presidential years, she uncovers little about his relationship with Humphrey, Hoover, Jackie Kennedy, McNamera, and his aids like Jenkins and Connely.<br />Kearns writes from the perspective of a 1960s Harvard liberal arts grad and that biases her writing. She gives an inordinate amount of copy to Oedipal theories and interpreting LBJ?s dreams, the latter of which one gets the sense that LBJ made up to entertain his subject. This book would have been better titled \\"Analyzing Lyndon Johnson\\".<br />All that said, this bio has actual experience with its subject that other authors do not have. Mrs. Kearns had unfettered personal access to LBJ for the last few years of his life. Accordingly, she uncovered some interesting facts about his childhood, college life, and professional career. This work is about as close to LBJ's memoirs as we will ever get, as he had apparently intended Kearns to ghost-write them. And she includes some analysis of presidential history which provides a context to LBJ's policies. She provided a good analysis of why LBJ continued with his Vietnam policy, dissecting the influence of his personality, egoand paranoia.<br />It's a worthwhile read for an LBJ enthusiast, but I recommend a more modern bio for a reader wanting a quick history. Also, for even more insight into LBJ without the third party bias, I strongly recommend Beschloss' production of the LBJ tapes.	2003-08-20

A powerful and entertaining biography of a section of LBJ's life and a good insight into how the Senate works. Caro appears to be an excellent biographer and his passion for his subject is very evident. Stephen Lang is excellent as the narrator and he captures the vocal energy and mannerisms of LBJ, Humphrey, Russell and a chorus of others.<br />All that said, I heard the abridged version from Audible, and was disappointed with what was apparently left out. Having read Dalleck and heard the LBJ tapes that Beschloss produced, I know the editor could have done a better job capturing LBJ's personality and drive. Still, as it is an abridged version, such a comment is highly subjective, and overall I highly recommend this for those interested in LBJ, recent American history, and/or inner workings of Congress.	2003-08-10

Fredd Wayne brings Franklin to life with what seems like a perfect portrayal. He *performs* rather than narrates.<br />Without the insight from Issacson, or, I suspect, from any decent biography of Franklin, the autobiography is disjointed, as he wrote different sections at different times of his life, and some time periods are eliminated completely. And it seems to have multiple personalities, struggling between the subjects of self-help, biography, history and simple meanderings and ruminations of an old man.<br />As a companion book - 5 stars; as a standalone - 2-3 stars	2003-08-09

I was also amazed that despite being so active in America, he spent nearly two decades of his adult life in England and France, where he also was held in high repute. He was simultaneously arrogant and humble, self-righteous and self-effacing, caustic and sensitive, but always interesting and always on the move.<br />I also liked the discussions of his interfacing with other notable figures of history, like Washington, Adams, and Jefferson, which makes me want to pick up their bio's as well.<br />I have just started Franklin's autobio, and it is very interesting after just finishing Isaacson to hear Franklin in his own words.	2003-07-31

Or for a hands-on technician who is new to the technology in general. <br />The author is a former Novell employee and this is the third version of the book, so readers can expect some broad insights and no vendor bigotry. In many sections, one can tell that &quot;Server 2003&quot; was added to the text via &quot;search and replace&quot;, but it matters little, and Server 2003 was directly addressed in areas where it matters (i.e., global catalog servers, etc.).<br />Architects and implementers should pass on this one, but managers and consultants should pick it up.	2003-07-20

For what PMI calls the foundation of project management, the 55 page presentation of the WBS is miniscule. And one would expect a lengthy discussion from either the academic or empirical perspective, but it gives neither, nor is it a good hybrid. The book itself is no more than a few dozen poorly bound 8-1/2x11 pages that fell apart during my first session of reading.<br />To be sure, the manuscript does contain some gems of wisdom, but in the aggregate, they do not justify the price. There is only cursory discussion of techniques to create the WBS content (e.g., Delphi, Crawford Slip, NGT), and there is an amazing dearth of example and sample WBS's, unlike the PMI's practice standard document, and it only touches on integrating the WBS into the actual PM process.<br />&quot;How to Build a WBS&quot; is a document that all PMs should read, but it should be available as a low-cost or free downloadable PDF. For those PMs searching for a WBS bible, you must keep on looking.	2003-07-20

Kennedy, 1917-1963	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Excellent work	The nine-hour abridged Audible version provided good coverage of JFK's early life, wartime heroics, congressional career, and Cuban and Vietnam policies, without the typical sensationalizing usually found in JFK bios. The author also brought to light some very interesting facts such as JFK's health adversities and fiscal conservatism. I expected to hear more on the relationship with LBJ, but after all, it was an abridged version.	2003-07-19

Whatever one thinks of the politics of Mrs. Clinton, surely they would agree that she's lived an interesting life, worthy of a bio. Revisionist history? Yes, probably to some extent, but aren't all autobiographies?<br />The first half provided some new insights and was very interesting; the second half just seemed to restate facts. All in all, still an enjoyable listen. I heard the unabridged Audible version, read by the author.	2003-07-05

If you like to read Forbes or the MarketPlace section of the WSJ, you'll like this book.

I am a fan of Beschloss and liked this work, but I felt it was incomplete. There was much intense focus on Henry Morgenthau and his plan for Germany - which indeed was a story worth telling - but Truman's contribution was short-changed. It's almost as if Beschloss' editor was demanding the manuscript and he had to wrap up quickly, unable to devote his characteristic comprehensiveness to the entire linear spectrum covered by the title... Still, Beschloss provided excellent insight into the inner workings of FDR's foreign policy team and challenges for the post WW2 leaders...	2003-06-02

It was part \\"Millionaire Next Door\\", part Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\", part anti-Republican treatise, and part fast food expose.

Although there is really nothing revolutionary about \\"Revolutionizing IT\\", this is a good book for seasoned and war-torn IT professionals as well as end-users frustrated with their IT departments. It offers some *evolutionary* ideas on how to improve project and support methodologies based on the experience of the Andrews Consulting Group.<br />Several principles put forth are those many of us already knew but never mentioned out loud.<br />+ Despite how much time, money, and attention given at the outset of the project, it is impossible to create a complete plan and cost estimate for an IT project.<BR>+ Any complex design will be imperfect.<BR>+ Scope control, although unpopular, is absolutely critical.<BR>+ There will never be enough resources available to build the optimum solution.<br />Some insightful tenets I took away.<br />+ Those most familiar with an existing system/design are in a poor position to lead the recommendation of a new one (because of a bias)<BR>+ IT professionals like complexity and by their nature tend to bring more complexity into projects.<BR>+ Endusers should be 100% accountable for projects.<BR>+ Time is a project's worst enemy - as more time passes between approval and deployment, the number of things that can go wrong and the number of assumption that can change increases.<br />The authors discuss their \\"RITE Approach\\", which again is not revolutionary ... or contradictory to other methodologies, but rather offers some common sense best practices that complement waterfall, Agile, and RUP methodologies. The authors self-admittedly bash the waterfall paradigm but then come back and confess that the waterfall is the foundation of all PM methodologies.<br />Good book to read to insure you're on the right track...	2003-05-21

The authors definitely presented some contrarian - if not completely original - thinking. The book started out promising and did indeed contain some gems, but I was left somewhat unsatisfied, given some of the stellar reviews I had read here.<br />I felt they included a good bit of filler to make 257 pages. I would have rather they spent more time on a complete review of the case studies; as it is, they just cited parts and pieces, leaving the analytical reader questioning if these examples were contrived.<br />Two-thirds into the book, the authors switched gears, moving from self reflection and managing one's own strengths and weaknesses to the area of managing others' strengths and weaknesses. They had not fully developed the first subject, but yet they ambitiously introduced a new one - which really warrants its own book.<br />I was also disappointed in the StrengthsFinder tool website. Only one pass is allowed and I could not find much explanation on how answers are processed, much less an objective third-party review of the test. This seems strange for a \\"25-year, multi-million dollar effort\\".	2003-05-04

As other reviewers have stated, it is short on practical specifics, long on generalities and is somewhat repetitive.

This is for everyone who ever feared being labeled an apostate for speaking the heresy about conflicts of interest between Big 5 auditors and consultants and also investment bank analysts and underwriters. <br />The book may strike some as self-righteous, but politics aside, this is good insight and plain talk from an insider. I hope Levitt's &quot;Chinese wall&quot; becomes a frequent discussion topic at business schools.<br />I listened to the Audible version and from that perspective, I found the reading a little disorganized. I would have appreciated more references to the overall timeline and big picture, but that is always a risk with any audio version of a print book.	2003-02-17

It discusses the *practice* of managing and administering servers, rather than focusing on operating system commands and utilities. While written for Unix sysadmins, many of the lessons discuss elements generic to all operating systems.<br />In the first half of the book, he discusses the basics of planning, setup and impact to the data center, testing, and a support organization. It is an IT Management 101. In the latter half, there is more focus on Unix, but even then, most of the material is relevant to all operating systems. He discusses communications, procedures, and documentation.<br />This is a must-read for a manager of system administrators or for a lead or lone administrator of a small shop. In fact, I would recommend every sysadmin read this book, as the cutbacks typical of this tough economy are forcing more and more IT employees to broaden their scope of responsibility from the mechanics of the OS to general computer operations.	2003-01-28

Tony Horwitz' \\"Confederates in the Attic\\" is a poignant, insightful and entertaining journey, which - in my case - was personalized and brought to life by the narration of the talented Michael Beck (I listened to the six-hour Audible version).<br />For Civil War buffs, sociologists, or anyone interested in the juxtaposition of the old and new South, this is a must-read. Furthermore, I would recommend this to any Southern native who wants to get a little more understanding of what shaped the world they grew up in.	2002-12-22

Each page is only half-full of double-spaced text providing a self-contained message, and the facing page contains tidbits of poetry or anonymous biting comments, making the book a quick read and easy to pick up and start at any page. <br />These pages provide encouragement, sympathy, and warmth. If suffering from major loss or betrayal, advice like \\"hug yourself ... it feels good\\" and \\"be gentle with yourself\\" may seem patronizing; however, the book will still provide some solace, even if it's the stoic \\"there is nothing to be done.... Only accept it, and hurt.\\" While those words do not cuddle the aching heart, they do provide sobering realism: life is tough and people can be cruel. For what it tries to be, this book succeeds.	2002-10-26

In Part 2, he presents a discussion on \\"people\\", organizational, and political issues which would be valuable for any new IT manager, although less so for experienced ones. Finally, on page 109, in part 3, \\"Processes\\", he finally begins the meat of the book.<br />Schiesser defines systems management as twelve processes: Availability, Performance and Tuning, Production Acceptance, Change Management, Problem Management, Storage Management, Network Management, Configuration Management, Capacity Planning, Strategic Security, Disaster Recovery, and Facilities Management.<br />He discusses each of the above areas, devoting a chapter for each. Some chapters provide more insight than others. Most of the points are obvious for a weathered IT manager, but it does provide value in compiling all the obvious points in one place. And, as mentioned earlier, it provides a framework for thought about managing a data center and or an enterprise.<br />Schiesser uses a lot of paper with lists of things: characteristics of process owners, resources to consider, steps to developing..., issues, challenges, etc., etc. He also includes assessment worksheets for each process - in duplicate versions: one with weights and one without. That is within the text --- he lists them again in the appendix. I think over half the book is assessment worksheets ... and a lot of white space. If he was adamant about listing all of these worksheets, I think the reader would have been much more appreciative of an included CD so they could actually use them without hiring a typist.<br />Appendix A is a FAQ, which is an excellent idea to address random thoughts about each chapter, but it was much too short at ten pages. I would much rather have an expanded FAQ rather than hundreds of pages of assessments.<br />He concludes the book with Part 4 \\"Technology\\" - a title I thought was a misnomer. This part includes a chapter on \\"Developing Robust Processes\\", with sections like \\"Helpful Ground Rules for Brainstorming\\" and \\"Understanding the Differences between a Formal and Informal Process\\", which I thought were inappropriate for the subject of the book and too cursory to be of any use. This chapter is followed by another cursory presentation of technology to automate processes, a chapter discussing integration of the 12 processes, and finally special considerations for client-server and Internet computing.<br />\\"IT Systems Management\\" is a good *overview*. IT managers with a few years in the industry will appreciate the framework presented in the 200 pages of part 3, but should not expect any earth-shattering revelations or new insights. For a more detailed presentation of the subject, look into the ITIL books.	2002-10-13
