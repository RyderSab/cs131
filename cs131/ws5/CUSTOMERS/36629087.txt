The Spirit of Zen by Alan W. Watts was the perfect place to start learning about the groundwork in understanding and analyzing Zen and Eastern philosophies. From there, I'm currently indulging myself on reading up on Zen and now I'm reading Zen Mind: Beginner's Mind by Suzuki (review for that coming soon), and I will read other books by Watt since this book was a real eye-opener.	2004-01-23

It is by far the most psychotic and disturbing work of fiction I have ever read. It's about a guy who works for Wall Street in the 80s, who is living his version of the American Dream in the era of Reagan, high spending and corruption. His profile fits that of a \\"yuppie\\" since his taste in foods, clothing and music is high-class, trendy and shallow. He is also a racist, a homophobe, and totally intolerate and inconsiderate of those economically and socially lower than him. He is also a fan of fine wine and hard drugs, like Xanax and cocaine.<br />Despite that profile of being a complete snob, there lies a much darker and disturbing side, particuarly his sexual existence, and his massive homicidal streak. He has sex with women, then brutally murders them in ways your average serial killer couldn't think of. He also murders a homeless guy and an innocent child at the zoo. His life is a life of depravity, and his lifestyle is completely deplorable. I would not recommend this book, since it is full of sadism, debauchery, and filth. However, the one main thing about this book is that it was completely captivating and the gruesome details of the murders,and his indulgences make Ellis a great author just by the way this novel stuck in my head and how it made me read on to see what happened next, as much as I wanted to put it down.	2004-01-05

I read both of those in 2 days (1 day per book). Then I read &quot;Survivor&quot; another masterful complicated tale about Tender Branson, a man who survived a death cult (Creedish), and goes on to be a self-help mogul and a bizarre prophet.<br />The way this book was written was very interesting. It starts at Chapter 47 (or 49, I can't remember, it's early in the morning) and the chapter numbers descent throughout the entire book. It starts with Tender, now a wanted fugitive for murder, on a plane about to crash into the Australian outback since the engines have all burned out, and he has only a few moments to figure out where his life went wrong. From there, as the chapters (and his plane) descend, you are given a view of his less-than-ordinary life, and the less-than-orindary people he comes across, most importantly Fertility. It's a book filled with bizarre twists, characters, events, and revelations. Palahniuk is probably the best modern day author out there.	2003-11-22

The pinnacle of his unpredictability was his 1973 novel, Breakfast of Champions. Vonnegut created two complex characters, Kilgore Trout and Dwanye Hoover. Kilgore Trout is an 'unknown' science fiction writer and Dwayne Hoover is a Midwest Pontiac dealer who uses Trout's book \\"Now It Can Be Told\\" as his inspiration for being a \\"homicidal maniac.\\" Despite the winding storyline, Vonnegut's personal philosophy creeps in about racism, sexism, jingoism and everything else wrong in American society. You have to read this book carefully and thoroughly or else it will fly over your head. It's an awesome book, perhaps one of his best novels.	2003-11-03

It gives the reader a glimpse of Manson's life as he was incarceratedfor the Helter Skelter murders. Whereas Helter Skelter was more about the trial, this book reflects a lot more on Manson's life both in and out of prison. It also contains transcripts from several of Manson's parole hearings.

A lot of it has to do with homosexuality, drag queens, drugs, financial and relationship problems, and living in bad neighborhoods. It was hard to read, due to lack of punctuation, and Selby's scatterbrain style of writing (he himself said in an interview that he had some sort of mental problem, so I can see that), but overall it was a good book and if you're willing to take an adventure into the underworld of Brooklyn and disillusionment, read this book.	2003-09-25

Yet he manages to diminish the mystique slightly by writing &quot;Subterraneans,&quot; a book about everyday romance gone awry. It shows his alter ego, Leo Percepied, who falls in love with a woman named Mardou Fox, both denizens in the underground world of the Beats during the era of McCarthyism, Buddy Holly and I Love Lucy. Leo's infatuation w/ Fox began largly because &quot;she was a Negro,&quot; but soon afterwards, the two began a romance. &quot;Subterraneans&quot; shows the trials, the highs and the pitfalls of romance, with everything from drugs, experimentation and temptation. Kerouac's writing is scattered, full of broken sentence fragments, witty insight, and literary references, like his colleague William S. Burroughs, but &quot;Subterraneans&quot; remians one of Kerouac'smost poignant books.	2003-08-06

I took a foreign policy class my junior year of high school, and it was a real eye-opener, perhaps the best class I have ever taken in my life. When I read this book, I felt like I was there all over again. <br />Up until the Cold War ended, the United States' government was almost obsessed with fighting Communism, and from McCarthyism, to verbal qualms with the USSR, and it became a global witchhunt to fight the 'evils' of Communism. To my surprise, there were also many coups and military actions against other countries that werealmost entirely covered up by the United States government, some happening during an administration which was thought to be run by 'one of the most honest presidents we've ever had,' Jimmy Carter. The crucifixation of El Salvador was a really disturbing part to read, since Chomsky gets into detail how many citizens were slaughtered by the military of their country (it makes the Holocaust look tame, not to downplay the terrible situation the Jews endured in the concentration camps). The US sent funds to aid their countries but somehow most of those funds made it into the pockets of the terrorists who were altering a country's respective government. <br />This book also shows how a Third World Country has little hope of advancement, since the US arguably intimidates them or ignores them. According to Chomsky, the US has very little popular support for its goals in the Third World. They also try to avoid negotiations so the needs of the Third World are left on the back burner and any hopes of getting help remain halted. Whenever an uprising starts though, the US is always there to flex their muscle as a superpower, since one of the main goals of foreign policy is to protect all of Her borders, and all of Her enemy's borders.<br />I cannot view an overall opinion on Chomsky's work since this is the only book I have read by him to date. The title of this book is suggestive, but the text itself is backed up w/ valid information and contains references to other texts dealing w/ such issues on American foreign policy. There seems to be no prejudice towards the liberal side of the spectrum or the conservative side (in this book, he questions both of those groups), and he doesn't flat out insult America or any politicians, something other writers related to Chomsky (Ann Coulter,Michael Moore) are knwon for doing.	2003-07-29

She is then betrothed to Petruchio, who uses the 'cruel to be kind' method to try to change Katharina's personality by being cruel and uncompromising towards her. In the end it ultimately works, and Katharina becomes more subtle, respectful, and ultimately falls in love w/ Petruchio.<br />It is a great play by Shakespeare, very humorous (with a genius use of sarcasm wit and puns), and it is one of his more rewarding plays on many levels. Not only is it a pleasure to read, but the theme of the story, by transforming a shrew into a better person, is very positive, a relief from the darker subjects Shakespeare used in his more famous plays (i.e. Romeo &amp; Juliet).	2003-07-24

But to many people, it's the only Shakespeare play and there are all of those pretentious teenyboppers/pubescent teenage girls who basically lament over how it's so romantic, and all that stuff, basically categorizing it in the ilk of pointless, bland and meaningless romance novels. It is also used as a metaphor for anything romantic, to the point where it's predictable, cliched and trite, an insult to Shakespeare and his works.<br />And if you think about it, the play itself is somewhat unrealistic in my opinion, mainly about how Romeo and Juliet fell in love and died together. They knew each other for 3 days, but probably knew of each other's existence since their respective families (Montague and Capulet) were bitter enemies. You can't really fall in love in 3 days... well you can I suppose, but not to the point where you would commit suicide over it. Plus the ending could've been varied in real life: Sure the two families could have made amends when their two children died, but it could also have further divided them as well, so you must imagine the possibilities on such an event.<br />Despite its cliches and questionable sense of reality, R&amp;J is a worthwhile play, certainly an essential piece of literature. It is not the best Shakespeareplay in my opinion, but you can check it out if you'd like.	2003-07-22

It is a good vs evil tale about a man, Macbeth, who apparently sees three witches, who are said to be prophets. He starts out as noble, serving the King of Scotland, and a brave and ruthless warrior (&quot;unsealed him from the nave to the chops&quot;). Repeated meetings w/ the three witches would have a profound effect on Macbeth, and his wife, Lady Macbeth. He slowly becomes deranged and hungry for power, and the entire play showcases his manipulative rise to the top, all the way to the point where he becomes the King of Scotland, and his eventual decline (also predicted accurately by the witches). It is full of awesome motifs, moral and interesting themes, great dialogue, action, and believable characters. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I had to read this my sophmore year of high school, and I had to analyze this book page by page, line by line, and the student teacher who taught it to us was obsessed with symbolism (like my sophmore teacher already was), and it diminished the appeal of the book to me, albeit slightly. Forget my past encounters in reading this book, because chances are they will not be helpful, but Macbeth is worth reading and analyzing, and it is easily one of Shakespeare's best plays.	2003-07-22

The Metallica video was horrifying, seeing a quadruple amputee with no face, and his macabre and desperate interior monologues, but the novel made Joe Bonham's own private hell a lot more clearer. <br />Joe Bonham, or &quot;Johnny,&quot; is an all-American young male who grew up in Colorado, and he would be considered normal as apple pie. Then he was shipped off to Germany in World War I, and got ambushed by a bombing attack, which left him armless, legless, faceless, and senseless (sans the sense of touch). While he is lying in his vegativie state, all he can do is think and reminisce about his life before he went off to war, and reflect on those things he would never experience again. The book grabs you and drags you into Bonham's agonizing, solitary world and parts of it were very heartbreaking and very emotional, one of the few books that required the use of a tissue. You feel his desperation, you feel his isolation, and Dalton Trumbo's personal philosophy on his opposition to warfare is sneaked into the narrative but he did it so that it went along w/ the story. His haunting introduction to the book, written around the time of the Vietnam War, makes you question the necessity of war and creates an unabashedly pacifist stance on war in general and how it ruins lives and families, and even nations. The book is undoubtedly liberal, especially in the introduction, but the book itself is told from a confused and rather blank or questioning perspective, hiding its message every time the nurse changes Joe Bonham's bedsheets, and every time Joe reflects on what life was and what life will be until he physically dies.	2003-07-15

It's a candid and graphic tale of bohemia and self-destruction dealing with William S. Burroughs' addiction to narcotics, or 'junk.' Here, you get a graphic and disturbing account of the symptoms of withdrawl, being an outlaw, financial problems as a result of addiction, and what it ends up doing to yuor life. The breaking point is rather late at the book, which heartbreakingly depicts Burroughs living in Mexico, going through tremendous withdrawl, and many of his friends either dead from overdoses or incarcerated due to selling or possession of illegal substances.<br />This new version of Junky shows the text in the original form, as Burroughs edited it, with none of the omissions from other publications of the book, and includes many articles that serve as 'forewords' to the book, as they were published in Junky's many versions, some by Burroughs himself, one by Carl Solomon and 2 by his longtime mentor, Allen Ginsberg.There is also a terminology, making it easier for the reader to understand the dialogue and the rather 'secret' words for drugs, sex and the like. Burroughs also wrote a 'myth VS reality' piece which is very interesting, to say the least. Junky may be an unpleasant read for some, but it is a very candid and amazing book, and one of the best novels of the 20th century.	2003-06-02

Ginsberg's views on America are still considered unorthodox and radical, but his observations both in the Hedonistic underground in the Baby Boomer-Leave It To Beaver 1950s, and his mentally ill friend Carl Solomon are as poignant as any poem written now, and represent a diminished sense of innocence in American culture, which predated feminism, the sexual revolution, AIDS, Reaganomics, ENRON, and even the full blown massacre of the Vietnam War. Very few poets have made an impact in writing now, but to me, Allen Ginsberg is the greatest poet of the last century, and easily had an impact on many writers today.	2003-05-31

He is a mixture of Kurt Vonnegut at his more witty and sarcastic, Don Delillo when he views society, and the carnal side of William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg. Choke is basically about a con artist who deals w/ a sex addiction, a mother w/ Alzheimer's, and pretends to choke on food at restaurants to earn money. He is also a med-school dropout who works as an indentured servant at some colonial theme park. <br />The main character, Victor Mancini, is a very tragic and tortured man, like many of the characters in this book. He can't make his real self talk to his Alzheimer's stricken mother when he goes to visit her, instead putting on a bogus alias and their relationship was obviously very tortured. He also deals w/ a major sex addiction which he cannot seem to overcome no matter how hard he tries. Choke is another example of Palahniuk's grim view of society, like his novel Fight Club, and it symbolizes the death of the American dream, by revealing the ugly side to society, such as illness, corruption, addiction and war (both political and personal). Choke is not a book for everybody, obviously. For me it was too hard to put down, with suspense and curiosity literally bouncing off of every page, but it's hard to fathom what would happen next in Victor Mancini's insane life, and it was too disturbing to ignore. Perhaps this is one of the most bizarre and disturbing books I've read in my life. After I put it down I was in awe, and I didn't know what to feel. It was very powerful, but it was also very negative the way Palahniuk ignores the beauty in society and literally plunges straight into a Hedonistic and corrupted underworld.	2003-05-21

It had many similarities to the movie, though the movie added some parts which were absent in the book, and the book had a few parts that were absent in the movie. <br />The book, Fight Club, was a very easy read for me (I read it in one night), and it actually made the movie make some more sense, though I quote it like one quotes the Bible, and the descriptions of many of the evnts were explained a lot more graphically than they were portrayed in the movie, and of course, the ending to the book was a surprise, to say the least, and I recommend this book just as much as I do the movie. Chuck Palahniuk is a great author, and Fight Club is one of the most important books to be released in the last decade.

He brings up his Catholic-based childhood, forming the Doors, dealing w/ rock stardom and Jim's Hedonistic behavior, the groups dissolution, failed marriages, Jim's death, family problems, and moving toward the future. It is evident that John had a lot of feelings towards Jim, like love, hate, anger, sympathy and sadness, and the part where he's at his grave in Paris is very poignant. He also recalls many of the events that shaped the Doors' brief but influential career as a rock band probably more accurately than anyone else who wrote a bio on the band or Jim Morrison. Yet, despite all of this, he does sound like he's complaining about life occasionally, and it is obvious that he had jealousy issues towards Jim, understandibly since he was such a sex icon, and his actions almost threatened to eat the group from inside out. Otherwise, this was a pretty good book, and should be considered for doing research on the band's, because who would know better about it than the guys in the band?	2003-03-26

In 1980, Lennon was out of the public limelight for 5 years, was happily married, had a son, and his comeback album Double Fantasy was selling well. Previous interviews were usually marred by his overhwelming sense of anger, cynicusm anbd political activism that almost got him deported in the early 70s. With that behind him, Lennon was ready to move forward with life, and candidly talked about his troubled youth, his inspiration from rock and roll, his time with the Beatles, his solo career, Yoko, and his plans for the future. You read htis and think \\"oh how nice, he has finally found himself, and he's finally happy,\\" but then unfortunately you feel sad at the same time, considering the events that happened right after these interviews. It's very sad and a letdown because he was so optimistic with quotes like \\"and I'll continue to do what I'm doing until I'm dead which hopefully won't be for a very long time.\\" <BR><BR>Even though his bliss was tragically cut short, these interviews with John Lennon serve as a good epitaph of his life, and even serve him better than most of his uneven solo career.	2003-03-04

Books	5	23	25	N	N	Well written and well researched	Micahel Moore's book Downsize This! shows the aspects of stupidity in American society. In the political spectrum, he is a liberal, but he is not quick to judge like other documents written by liberals and conservatives alike. Instead, he obviously does a ton of research and observes the patterns of politics and big business. He manages to pojnt out the shocking similarities between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, and denounces both of them as alike, and givespretty good reasons on why half the population doesn't take part in presidential elections. His views on abortion, though comical in some sense, surprisingly make a lot of sense  <BR><BR>Along with a satirical sense of honesty, Moore also throws in some very humorous commentary, like new and improved ways to vote for the President, and several jabs at certain politicians and corporations, especially a certain corporation he attacked in his documentary Roger and Me. <BR><BR>To read this book, an open mind is recommended. Moore's sharp wit and sense of being accurate, in most cases, may be too much for some to handle. This is obviously not a book for everyone, though I know many detractors and admirers on all sides of the political spectrum.	2003-03-03

He doesn't have the diplomacy, the syntax, or the vocabulary of other reknowned American writers like Hawthorne, Twain, or even Ginsberg, but he makes up for it with his brutal sense of honesty, and a very plausible sense of reality. Most of his works represent the struggle of every day life, finding yourself, and dealing with the harshness of people he comes across. The Portable Henry Rollins is a great introduction to his writing style, and only makes me want to dive in deeper into his works, and his mind.	2003-03-02
US	36629087	R30PEQQ7QJB6GQ	093948210X	755354949	The Antichrist	Books	5	29	34	N	N	Powerful	Whether you agree with him or not, you gotta admit that Nietzsche had some very strong arguments about the validity of Christianity, and how he views it as a form of weakness posing as a strong institution. There is a section where he takes verses from the Bible itself and explains in a way on how it is evangelical and dictatorial. Nietzsche was a deep thinker, perhaps too deep because he got really sick shortly after this book, and he didn't seem like the type of guy to just ramble about a topic without knowing about it. Him quoting the Bible and many other religious texts porves that he well-researched Christianity and made enough valid points to defend his position on Christianity. I am not an antichrist myself, thoguh I more or less shun organized religion, but Nietzsche has some very thought-provoking concepts. Sure it is offensive to one devout to Christianity, and I'd probably be offended if I was a practicing Christian, but this is recommended for those who study religions and philosophy, or just a powerful book in general.	2003-01-12

It was very powerful, and a very remarkable book to say that least. Probably the most realistic and the least sci-fi influenced of all those 'utopian society' novels.	2003-01-08

This book is a sad tale of lives gone terribly wrong, and people who had potential but couldn't use it due to illnesses. The unrequited romance between Ethan and Mattie, the sickness of Zeena, the botched suicide attempt, and the life on a cold, unproductive New England farm made the book very very depressing, and overall was a representation of stagnation.<br /><br />A very hard book to get into. I had to read it for school, and found it to be a chore. Despite the tragedies that are otherwise interesting, yet disturbing, Edith Warton unfortunately presents them in a bland, and rather impersonal manner. It has been hailed as a great novel, but I wouldn't call it essential reading.	2002-10-31

It gave a new dimension to reading, with the narrator being more sagacious and cynical, as opposed to the more amaible narrators in previous books up to that time, and it realistically gives an accurate insighty to a cofused adolescent's life during a time of such confusion and experiences. It's definitely an honest and a no-holds-barred book, and it may be a stretch to say that this book is almost 'mandatory reading,' but it should definitely be read no matter who you are.	2002-10-10

Then the Manson family kills 8 people, which symbolizes the darker side to the hippie/LSD/youth culture lifestyle. <BR><BR>Vincent Bugliosi was Manson's attorney during his infamous trial. Here he documents every shred of evidence and every detail which went into the ghastly homicide, and the trial itself, which resulted in Manson and 3 members of his family (Sadie, Lulu, and Patricia) being convicted of murder and sentenced to death, which was later turned into life in prison, due to California's abolishment of the death penalty in early 1970. <BR><BR>This also gives an unbiast view of Charlie's life (by the time he was 32, he spent 17 years in jail), his aspirations to become a rockstar, the members of his \\"Family,\\" why he and his family committed the murders, and, probably the most interesting yet odd part of the book, Manson's rather religious, dogmatic and supposedly prophetic interpretation of the Beatles' double-LP \\"The White Album.\\" It is complete with rather bizarre lyrical references from the people he was after (the \\"Piggies\\") the revolt that blacks were going to plan against whites (The lyrics to \\"Blackbird\\" describe \\"Helter Skelter,\\" which meant that blacks were going to destroy whites, led by \\"Rocky Racoon, who, strangely would be a 'coon,' not to be racist\\"), the Beatles as the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (The avant-garde sound effects of \\"Revolution 9\\", and how the 5th 'horseman' was actually Stuart Sutcliffe, who was in the group but died of a brain hemmorhage in 1962), and how the Beatles were planning to sail across the Atlantic to make Charlie a rockstar (The lyrics to \\"Honey Pie,\\" 'I'm in love but I'm lazy,' meaning that the Beatles were supposedly interested in Charlie but were too lazy to sail across the Atlantic to California to meet him). It's rather strange and laughable at the same time. <BR><BR>It also gives the viewpoint of Manson himself, with interviews, quotes, press releases and biographical information. His comments about Richard Nixon condemning him as a guilty man, while Nixon sends young men to Vietnam to get killed, was particularly interesting. <BR><BR>It's a very long, detailed account about the murders that would mark the end of an era, and one of the most notorious crimes in history. A book highly recommended for anyone interested in law, or anyone remotely interested in the Manson cult and/or ideology.	2002-10-05

He's decaying one day at a time, until an eccentric young woman named Circe Berman invades his privacy, bullies him into writing his autobiography, and revitalizes him with a new approach to life.  It has many uncanny similarities to Vonnegut's life, such as the experiences in Dresden, Germany, being married twice, and being unconventional and unique in their respective art forms (writing and painting in this case). <BR><BR>The journey begins with Rabo's parents escaping the Armenian Holocaust, then leads to his apprenticeship to Dan Gregory, a prominent Norman Rockwell-type painter who treats him like a peasant, and who is infatuated and enchanted by Hitler's philosophy, and the dictatorship in Europe circa World War 2. It also shows his affair with Gregory's girlfriend, Marilee Kemp, and their betrayal to Dan Gregory by going to the Museum of Modern Art and by making love to each other. It also shows his introduction to abstract-expressionism, and being in the same ilk as gorundbreaking and innovative painters, such as Jackson Pollock and Terry Rothko, both died due to self-destructive behavior.<BR><BR>This is a book you have to follow carefully in order to understand, since Vonnegut likes to switch back and forth to different time periods and zeitgeists in the course of this book. But it is essential reading, and certainly one of the most memorable books I have ever read in my entire life.	2002-10-05

I like the concept of having a 12-fingered/toed, anomalously tall and genetically odd person and his twin sister, with him becoming the President of the United States, and how his idea of using names to make people \\"lonesome no more\\" camr to be, and how rather Communist it really was, but it didn't really satisfy me that way other Vonnegut novels have in the past. Plus, he says 'hi ho,' more times than he should in this book. True, this was probably Vonnegut's definitive 'slapstick comedy' novel, but some of the story did not flow with each other, and the ending was pretty predictable.	2002-10-05

The bombing, the friends he lost, the confusion and mental turmoil he experienced after the war.. the whole book was very crystal clear. It's very personal and moving for a story written in the third person. It was unusual for Vonnegut to do that because most of his books I have read were written in the first person. Billy Pilgrim's transition from reality to imagination are very adequate and plausible, and gave a very real, yet isolated take of life during such a terrible war. It also documents the dehumanization of the atrocities of war, since death doesn't seem to have an effect on Pilgrim, but you can tell that he does have feelings, but the war kind of took away all the feelings that really mattered to him. I've always been a pacifist and had a strong anti-military stance, but this only enhances my perspective. Most war novels and movies usually glorify the fighting the the atrocities done to both soldiers and civilians, only adding to the concept of dehumanization, but the sensitivity of its characters, especially Pilgrim, the protagonist (though not lucid, but still evident) makes it a very different military novel from a very different writer.	2002-09-18

But then I read it again a year later and I got more out of it because I knew a lot more than I did during my initial phase of 'worshipping' Marilyn Manson.<BR><BR>Marilyn Manson is a very intelligent person, perhaps one of the most articulate people in show business. Some of the stuff he says in this book have become personal quotes, not so much now, but back then yes. It's very philisophical, but some of it was also perverse. I can understand the drug problems, and the tensions amongst his band mates, and his school and everyone else who may have oppressed him, but his sexual explorations and innuendos were somewhat uncalled for. I am not criticizing Manson or his lifestyle. I always believed that whatever decisions you have made add some piece to the puzzle of your existence that completely makes up who you are and who you will be for the rest of your life. But if I wanted to read about sex, I'd read Penthouse. <BR><BR>I absolutely loved how he made one full page of all the rumours that were spread about him, and his response in his journal about all of those rumours, such as the removing his two ribs so he can perform the Monica Lewinsky Treatment on himself, and how he was on the Wonder Years, the animal sacrifices and all of the rumours that he was gonna commit suicide at a show. To me that was a stroke of genius.<BR><BR>I may not be his biggest fan now, but after reading this, I began to understand Manson more than your average ignorant or open minded person would. I still respect him for sticking to his guns and not caring about what others think. But what kinda pisses me off is that whether he is onstage (great live performer by the way!), or offstage, he is still Marilyn Manson. There was no sense of Brian Warner whatsoever, and sometimes his persona is dehumanizing to his caliber. He hides behind stage makeup and mutilated tattered clothing, which is deemed pronographic by some. Of courtse it's supposed to add to his 'mystique' but when you're writing an autobiography, or a hagiography so personal as this one, you kind of have to step out of yourself for it. Even in some interviews. Take for example, Maynard James Keenan from Tool/Perfect Circle. When he's on stage he's Maynard, a God, an enigma, a shaman of sorts. But when he's offstage, doing interviews and whatnot, he's a simple man from Ohio with a candid and articulate personality, and someone who seems to be comfortable in his own skin, something Manson obviously isn't. Keenan offstage doesn't need his onstage antics or persona to float him or to make him completely unbelievable to his fans.<BR><BR>Overall, I recommend reading this book word by word without any biast about his music, or any rumours you may have heard from the Christian Right or any people who hate it. You're guaranteed at least some reaction, and probably a more intellectual reaction to Manson. Even some Manson haters liked this book, and agreed that he has a certain amount of intelligence.	2002-08-23

And of course, I had one of those teachers that was obsessed with analyzation and symbolism to the point where I even got to hate it, even though I'm a poet and a writer. The main character had a lot of mental problems, including violence, chauvinism, and overambition to become the 'model citizen' of his tribe. I had no sympathy for him, neither should you. Overall this book was very slow-moving, very dull, very boring, and as a result some of my most sardonic and thoughtful essays in that class were based upon this book. Thanks a lot!!!!

In my opinion, Burroughs wrote better short stories than novels. Recommendations are Sapre A** Annie (that's only the please the censors), Twilight's Last Gleamings, A Junky's Christmas and Word.

I think this was a very interesting concept to record 5 years worth of dreams and then put them into a book. Some of the images and characters Burroughs comes up with are so vivid and so realistic that when I read this I actually felt like I was with Burroughs during this subconcious journey.<br /><br />I liked how he used his dreams as education, and how he realized the importance of his dreams; a very Freudian quality. I think that this book represented finally coming to terms with your past, and accepting vicissitude (or change) that others tend to shy away from. This book is a very important addition to Burroughs' extensive body of work, and undoubtedly one of his best books. And often times it's overlooked because it's in the shadow of the Naked Lunch and the Soft Machine.	2002-08-10

Droog? word they used in the book to describe a friend), and I was pretty blown away by it. I loved how the author created an entirely different terminology for the book...This book, though an entire work of fiction, is proof that people can change their ways and repent from their diabolic behvavior. The movie was pretty whacked out too, though the book was probably better. The video had too many bright colours to reflect upon the darkness of the story, and the rather grey pictures I illustrated in my head while reading this. An undisputed classic, and should be read by anyone who wants to read a good book.	2002-08-08
